And Sydney University just introduced regulations to do that last year, as have a number of other universities.  And this is really dangerous.  This is about... hijacking criminal law, you know, rave accusations are now going to be adjudicated by some hotchpotch committee on campus using lower stands of proof without us having any ability to supervise what is going on there.  I've already interviewed two young men, interviewed on YouTube, two young men who've been accused by that sort of committee, one at Adelaide and one at UWA, and I'm hearing from students across Australia where this is happening.  And that's why I'm speaking on campuses.  This is a really dangerous move.  And the universities are complicit in this hijacking of our criminal law.  And someone has to speak out about this.  Thanks everybody for supporting me on my YouTube channel.  I've got growing numbers of subscribers, which is really exciting.  If you'd like to support me financially, go to my donate page on my website.  Thanks a lot. ",
