            "text": "Well, hi everyone and greetings from Northern Michigan.  This is Bob the Science Guy.  You know, I had a really great follow-up for One More Orbit, the world record circumpolar navigation flight that took place last week.  However, Where's Wally kind of beat me to it and used a lot of the things that I wanted to do.  So, let's go ahead and do my version of this, but I'm going to give full credit to Where's Wally.  You can see a link to the video and his channel in the description of this video.  And there they are, the crew of one more orbit.  Six men, two women, representing eight nations.  Their time of 46 hours, 40 minutes, and 22 seconds beat the old world record by almost six hours.  Now here is the flight path of that epic journey.  They started off at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  went to the North Pole, stopped in Kazakhstan, stopped in Marinas, passed through the South Pole, stopped in Chile, and then went back to Florida.  Now just to make it very clear, this is a Cassini projection of the Earth.  Now again, this is a flat projection of a spherical Earth.  As you can see, I've plotted out the flight path here, and it very clearly goes over both the North Pole on the left and the South Pole on the right.  Now, I'd like you to go ahead and have a look at the relationship between the tip of South America and Antarctica, and then another continent, Australia, beyond Antarctica.  That'll get important later.  Now, obviously this flight's caused quite an uproar in the Flat Earth community, but let's get a couple of things straight.  Number one, the live stream was not the documentation of the flight path.  The GPS track was.  2.  It has been certified as a world record by an outside body.  3.  It qualified as a circumnavigation by 1.  Passing over both poles and 2.  Passing over the equator twice at least 120 degrees apart on the spherical earth.  So, the fact that this is a world record, the fact that it was done on a spherical Earth, is not in question.  Now, in order to overcome this, the Flat Earth community has to, one, prove where the aircraft was other than on that flight path.  And that means you have to show me it parked at Heathrow Airport in London.  Or you have to physically demonstrate that you can prove it was someplace else.  Or two, you have to prove that the data was falsified.  Not suggest that it was falsified.  Not claim that it was falsified.  You have to prove that it was falsified because the data says that's where they were.  Now let's have a look at a couple of the problems the Flat Earth is having with this flight.  First, you'll all recognize the Gleason AE map, which is the quote-unquote flat earth map that many of them like to promote.  It's got the ice wall all the way around the outside, the North Pole's in the center.  You can see the flight took off from Florida.  It went to the North Pole.  It went to Kazakhstan.  It went east of Madagascar, and then it went down to the South Pole.  That's at point one.  Then instantaneously, it emerged at point two.  came up into Chile, and then flew back to Florida.  Now the question is, on a flat earth, how did it instantaneously get from point one to point two?  Now, let's go ahead and have a look at what a Gleason AE map is.  It's a projection of a globe, because something that most flat earthers don't seem to understand is the entire outside of that map, the ice ring, is Antarctica.  And the far outer edge, by where number one and number two are, is the South Pole.  It is a single point that goes all the way around the map.  If you have trouble visualizing this, let's go ahead and have a look at an animation from a friend of mine.  Now, on the top, you can see a freeze frame from Joselay's animation of the AE map folding into the globe.  Now, if you look at about 10 o'clock, you can see the Antarctic Peninsula, and just above it, you can see the tip of South America.  On number two, on the lower map, you can see the Antarctic Peninsula right underneath the tip of South America.  So, it's not a mystery as to how they got from point one to point two.  Now let's look at another map, this one from Antonio Subarets.  And then we'll have a little chat about Mr.  Subarets.  Now, Antonio Subarets is the self-proclaimed genius of Flat Earth.  He is so overwhelmingly smart that he actually solved this problem by coming up with his own map, which you can see on top.  Now, where's?  Wally went ahead and plotted out the flight path on Antonio's map?  And as you can see, we have a very similar problem.  There is not a continuous line of flight connecting both sides.  So we have the exact same problem that we had in the Gleason's map.  And as you can see with the Cassini map that we showed earlier, this is a continuous flight path that goes through both poles and connects all the way through, unlike Antonio's map.  But let's talk about Antonio for just a moment.  Now, About a month after I started making Flat Earth videos, I took up some silly challenge that Antonio Subarets put out.  And as part of that, I did an observation that required the use of a level.  And as you can see, the bubble on that level from my video is slightly off to the left.  It's still within the reference marks, but it's not perfectly centered.  Let's see what Antonio had to say about that. ",

            "text": "Well, you know, Antonio, although you put that video out to try and make fun of me, That's okay.  Because you see, in science, we like being corrected.  So what I did with this was I went out and I experimented to see how much of an error that actually represented.  It was less than the thickness of an American dime.  Now, more importantly, I researched spirit levels of that type a little bit more, and I discovered through my research, further research, that this type of a spirit level was not accurate enough to measure what I was trying to measure.  I didn't know that.  I learned something.  So what I did was the right thing.  I made a video, I acknowledged my mistake, and I withdrew this observation.  Let's see how you handle the same situation, Antonio, and let's see how much of an error you make compared to mine. ",

            "text": "Yes.  Now, mind you, My bubble was touching a reference line.  Antonio Subarets now has failed to, one, realize that Antarctica simply wasn't rendered in that thing from the onboard entertainment console for the passengers.  That's not a navigation map.  Second, he shows the turn at the South Pole and doesn't recognize that Antarctica simply isn't there, but the course is there.  Third, he not only misidentifies one continent, Antarctica, he identifies another continent, Australia, as Antarctica, and he identifies Madagascar as the tip of Africa.  Now, anybody can make a mistake, and I'm sure that he'll admit to this.  So let's watch a little further and see what he has to say. ",

And here is South Africa, which would be well missing here because of the banner.  Notice how here they have Antarctica over there.  Look at where Antarctica is on Google Earth.  I'm sorry.  Did you see that?  Did you see that?  Look at how on this, Antarctica is down here.  Okay.  Are you seeing?  Look, here is Antarctica.  Can you see?  Well, let's compare that with Google Earth.

            "text": "All right, so let's just make sure that we have this straight.  You have Google Maps up right in front of you, okay?  You've correctly identified South America right there.  You've identified where Antarctica should be.  You've got Madagascar and the tip of Africa, but you can't seem to figure out what this little landmass is right here at the three o'clock position.  Well, let's see.  It's kind of long and banana-shaped, and it's got a big old island right there, and then it's got a south island and a north island over here, and all you have to do is just take your mouse and kind of go, What do we have?  That's Australia and New Zealand.  That's not Antarctica.  That's how easy it is to check.  Granted, it's on the side, but with your genius, man, you should be able to convert that in your head.  Well, Antonio, thank you so much for identifying this egregious error here.  And I did correct it.  But then again, that was just kind of touching the index line.  It's not like I misidentified three different continents or anything.  Folks, be careful who you get your information from on YouTube.  This guy ain't somebody that you ought to be using as a reference.  So, thank you very much for stopping by.  This is Bob the Science Guy.  I'm signing out from northern Michigan.  We'll have a few more videos for you this week.  See you soon. ",
