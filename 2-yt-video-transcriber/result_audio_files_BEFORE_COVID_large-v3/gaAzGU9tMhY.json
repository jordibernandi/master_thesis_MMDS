            "text": "All right!  Nasty Nathaniel out here in the city of San Francisco, California.  And joining me is John Special.  And together we're going to be conducting a First Amendment audit of the Consulate General for the Republic of the Philippines.  Yeah!  We're going to make sure that our friends at the Philippine government respect and honor our constitutional right to film what we can see from a public space.  So let's go over there and audit.  Flying high and proud in the sky is the Philippine flag.  So this is it.  This is the Philippine Consulate for San Francisco.  It's located at 447 Sutter Street in the heart of beautiful San Francisco, which is my favorite California city.  And the building, it's actually located inside this building called the Philippine Center.  And it became the Philippine Consulate, or should I say it was established immediately following the Philippine government getting independence in 1946.  And then the following year, they opened the Philippine Consulate for Los Angeles.  And that originally was an extension office, but then it became... its own independent consulate in 1955.  But yeah, you can see a lot from the street.  I guess there's people applying for visas and that sort of thing.  And we've got the Christmas tree there.  Nice to see they're participating in this joyous holiday season.  I've actually been in the Philippines during the Christmas holiday season, whatever you want to call it, whatever is politically correct these days.  And the Filipino people really get into Christmas.  It's really a big deal for them.  I think it's actually a bigger deal in the Philippines than it is here in the United States.  The Filipinos really love Christmas.  I mean, I'm not saying that we Americans don't, but I think they start celebrating Christmas in September, I believe.  So it's a big deal in the Philippines.  And we got some Filipino officials there, like, looking important, like, discussing how they're going to overthrow the Duterte administration.  We got, like, what appears to be a security checkpoint that we may be able to get kind of a close-up look at because this guy is, like, coming in there.  He's going to get patted down and maybe get a cavity search.  Or I hope not, for his sake.  But probably an expat.  Probably, you know, probably lives in the Philippines.  Probably married a 19-year-old girl or whatnot.  And now he's taking care of his visa issues or whatnot.  Who knows?  But yeah, this is the, this is it.  Well, so far, all is peaceful.  They're not doing anything.  So maybe this is going to be a successful audit.  Well, depending on what you consider a successful audit.  Well, you won't see a shortage of cameras at these places.  Eye in the sky sees us all.  I wonder who else.  Huh?  Can I help you?  Yeah, we're filming the Philippine Consulate. ",

Like, how is my camera going to affect their security cameras?  And we got people there waiting to go through the metal detector.  And he's got like, what is that, like a magic wand or something that he's going to swat you if you try to bring something through that you're not supposed to.  Yeah.  Looks like he's given some kind of a directive.  Got this gentleman right here.  He's on the phone.  I wonder who he's calling.  Maybe he's calling local PD or maybe the Philippine Intelligence Agency.  And we've got this guy over here behind the Christmas tree who's giving us a cam back.  There he is.  See him?  Cam backing us.  Oh, yeah, you want to play this?  Well, you know, if you come out onto the street, you can get a better shot, you know.  You don't have to hide behind the Christmas tree.  Well, this thing is kind of interesting.  I didn't notice what it was.  It's like some kind of a... Is that a piano, or...?  Oh, no, those are keys.  Like a keyboard, and then there's this, like... What is that?  Some kind of I don't know, is that like a kiosk where you can, like, book your ticket to Manila on Philippine Airlines?  I don't really like the... Really?  Well...
