With Smite Game, Twitch, Humble Bundle, SteelSeries, NZXT, CCP Games.  All these motherfuckers won't sponsor me.  Oh my god.  I almost choked myself half to death.  You mean this dude was sponsored by every company that turns its nose up at me?  Oh, Gundam?  That guy?  What a piece of shit.  But Thomas Chang?  He's a good guy.  Jesus Christ.  I had to end the video right there.  I didn't even read this shit.  See, let that be a lesson to you sponsors.  Sometimes the good guy is the guy who thinks the bad guy.  All right.

You may have seen this chick before, Helena Live.  You've seen her probably on my multitude of Twitch.videos because Helena Live is like fucking Mewtwo, alright?  If this was Pokemon Go, Helena Live would be that really dangerous, toxic Pokemon you'd love to get your hands on but you can't because it's just too risky.  Then you show up to the Poke Gym and you find a dead hooker under the bridge.  If you don't believe me, Google Dead Bodies Pokemon Go.

He had to chain it to a goddamn refrigerator.  It went so nuts.  Then one day it flipped out, went after him.  The dog dragged the refrigerator, got him up against the wall.  Dogs in his face about to rip his head off.  The dog broke its own neck trying to kill him.

And with today's hyper politically correct nature, I'm surprised she even went there on Twitch.  You know?  Like, for real.  She's been in trouble numerous times.  Why would you even go there about gender on Twitch?  You know how Twitch is.  You know how everything is now.  Sit back, shut up, smile, and collect your large amounts of money for breathing oxygen.  This girl makes more in a month than I probably make in a year or two.  Well, she did.  Not anymore.  She's off Twitch.  She's probably crying a goddamn river now.  That's why she's pissed.  She's like, I'm so mad I'm shaking.  Of course she's shaking.  She's probably clearing 100 Gs a month.  Now she's dropped down to probably 5 Gs.  She's probably losing her shit.  In her little video where she talks about her ban, she says Twitch told her she was banned numerous times.  She says she's only been banned once.  What about suspensions?  How many times has this chick been suspended?  I could see her being suspended numerous times.  But maybe not.  Who knows?  I don't really keep up with her.  Because, frankly, I can't sit through her streams to record stuff.  I just get, like, you know, I'm like, oh, my God, this chick is a fucking pain in the ass.  She's a pain in the ass.  Fuck.  And it's hard to feel bad for because it's a cute chick, a twitch thot, with a bad attitude that finally got banned.  I can't say I'm crying a river, even though it's for erroneous reasons.  But still, she kind of had it coming.  The thing is, I think she's shocked.  she got punished for it.  She's probably never really had to deal with any major shit ever in her life, and you could tell.  You could tell.  Certain people.  You know, you meet them, you look at them, and you could go, that guy has seen some shit.  You know?  I look at her and I go, this girl's never had a rough day in her life.  Her personality says so.  And the funny thing is, I gotta give her this.  I gotta give her this.  At least she's honest with who she is.  You know, you watch some of her stream, you could tell Helena thinks her shit doesn't stink and she's God's gift.  Pokimane, on the other hand, that bitch knows how to play the game.  You look at Pokimane, oh she's nice, she's cute, she's sweet, she's innocent.  You know, you think at first glance.  Then you find out Pokimane is like this manipulative fuck behind the scenes.

Let me play the cute, innocent, sweet card.  But Helena, you know what you're getting from day one.  So I got to respect that.  Oh, well, that's that.  Poor Helena won't be making mountains and fistfuls of money anymore.  She'll probably have to stream on YouTube or... I was about to say ChatterBait.  She'll have to stream on YouTube or Mixer or something like that.  She'll still make her coins, but she won't be making as much as she made on Twitch, and that's really what's burning her ass.  That, in fact, somebody finally laid a hammer down on her.  Like, all right, that's it.  You're done.  Get the fuck out of here.  She's like, wait a minute.  What?  Hello?  I'm Helena.  And they're like, yes, we're done, dear.  We're done here.  Goodbye.  You know, if I pulled half the crap she did on Twitch, I'd have been banned permanently.  Like, I'd have been gone for good.  It would have been no jokes.  I'd have been poof.  I'd have been out.  I would have vanished faster than Michael Jackson's popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s.  You know what?  On that note, I'm the hell out of here because I want this to be a fast video.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, could I do a video that doesn't require eight hours of editing?  Please do.  You know the whole spiel, man.  You're going to have to rate, comment, subscribe, and share my videos because YouTube thinks they can suppress me simply because I don't say politically correct things.  And that's no fun.  Life is no fun like that.  I'm sorry.  I grew up in New York in the 80s and 90s.  People said what they felt.  You know, back then, a father could smack his son around in the streets and throw him into a car.  And all the neighbor would say was, hey, watch my antenna.  Hell, even look at this.  Some Overwatch streamer called Barry Ha.  I don't know.  This Asian girl.  She's a little cross-eyed.  Kind of cute, though.  I could overlook that cross-eyed thing real easy if she asked me at the dinner.  Anyway, she said... ",

Man, who gives a shit?  You know, this Overwatch... Fuck.  If I said it, she's apologizing everywhere.  Regarding my remarks to South America, Europe, regions on stream, I apologize for my words and offense.  they have caused.  my comments were meant for entertainment but clearly missed a mark.  i will strive to think more critically about my words in the future.  good god almighty you just can't say you think a region of players suck.  i think the asian area china and south korea.  the last thing i want to see in fucking overwatch is a south korean.  i'm like fuck it.  it's over.  the match is over.  They're too goddamn good because they have nothing better to do but play Overwatch and watch Korean drama.  I'm genuinely sorry I fucked up here.  If I did that shit and people called me out, I'd have said, you're fucking right, I did it.  Just like when I lost the voice acting spot for like a Fallout mod I was really looking forward to because I made fun of Macho Man Tranny Savage.  You know what I did on Twitter?  Because that's where they saw my little tweet.  You know what I did on Twitter?  I'll tell you right now.  I went right back there and I said, you're fucking right, I did it.  And I posted it again.  Retweet.  Fuck you.  Jesus, everybody's lost their balls.  I'd like to apologize because my retweet clearly missed the mark.  Hold on, let me read her message.  I apologize for my retweet and the offense they have caused.  My tweets and comments were meant for entertainment purposes, but clearly missed the mark.  I will strive to think more critically about my words and retweets in the future.  Smiley face.  Hashtag pussy wizard.  Oh, I am so demonetized.  What have I done? ",
