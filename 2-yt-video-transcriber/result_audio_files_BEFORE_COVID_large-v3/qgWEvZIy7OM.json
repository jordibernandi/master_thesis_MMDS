So my plan, the Freedom Dividend, would give every American adult $1,000 a month, $12,000 a year starting at age 18.  This would create millions of jobs around the country and would allow families and individuals to help manage this historic transition that we're in, in terms of technology transforming the labor force.  And so this idea, it's new to many Americans, but it's actually as old as the country itself, where Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country.  He called it the citizen's dividend.  Martin Luther King was for it in the 1960s.  Milton Friedman and a thousand economists signed a study saying this would be great for our society.  And one state has had a dividend for 37 years, where everyone in the state of Alaska is getting between $1,000 and $2,000 a year, no questions asked.  And what they're doing in Alaska with oil money, we can do for the rest of the country with technology money. ",

Now, in today's economy, you can create a very rich and successful business that doesn't employ lots of people.  If it does employ people, it can employ them as gig or temporary or contract workers.  And it does not need to pay them well enough to buy the goods and services because you can sell globally.
