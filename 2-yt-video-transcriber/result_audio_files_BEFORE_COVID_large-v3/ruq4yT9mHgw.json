He wants the prosperous soul to hit you so much.  See, because when you have a prosperous soul, money doesn't matter to you.  The more you have, the more you give.  I promise you.  The more God gives you, the more you funnel and you just become a giver.  and you give and you give and you give and you give.  Why?  Because God so loved the world that he gave.  So that's what we as Christians do.  We give.  We give.  We give.  People are like, well, you're just after money.  No.  God's not after you.  He's after you ever being had by money.  Money doesn't make the world go round.  Jesus does.  Do you know when you become a radical giver and you become a radical, just a radical tither?  and a radical offerer and a person that just, that blesses people, you actually step into the Abrahamic blessing.  The blessing of Abraham. ",

Years ago when Reinhard Bonnke wrote a book about a life of fire, it's like this thick, you will not be able to put it down.
