Though it's never said in the video, what we're dealing with here is the problem of evil.  How can God be loving but also act like a complete rat bastard?  The fact is, he can't.  If Christians could just admit that, yeah, God ain't perfect, this whole mess goes away.  Instead, they have to double down and try to find ways to reconcile an often terrible and unjust universe and a God who could and should make it less so. ",

And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.  Romans 8, 28 when we think of natural disasters and other tragedies we generally don't see such events being done for purposes of good but they often are.  i think a few years back i remember massive flooding happening in texas where franklin graham and samaritan's purse responded with disaster relief.  I remember watching it on the news for several days, watching how people were constantly having to be rescued by boat.  I thought to myself how terrible that must have been for them until I heard Franklin Graham talk about it sometime later.  Graham said that hundreds of people in the midst of this tragedy were being saved and coming to Christ.  That doesn't surprise me at all. ",

We're always told we're horrible, worthless, tainted sinners.  2.  They try to control your life.  We're told how to have sex and fall in love, what to eat, how to dress, and countless other ways we should or shouldn't behave.  Having standards is one thing, but this comes with threats if we don't conform.  Three.  They control who you can spend time with.  Goodness knows that plenty of religions tell us to avoid certain people, usually those who aren't part of their particular sect.  Four.  They're constantly jealous.  Same as number three, spend time with the wrong people and God's gonna get way grouchy.  And if thou dost haveth any gods before him, whoa, thou shalt look out.  Five, they damage things when they're angry.  God sure does love to smite, doesn't he?  Six.  You feel like you're trapped in the relationship.  How many of my fellow atheists didn't know how to leave their religion, felt that they couldn't, that they'd lose friends and family, among other things, if they did?  I bet that's a lot of you.  More than a few have told me their stories, and I'm sure a lot more haven't.  They don't handle disagreements well.  Like, by punishing you with eternal damnation if you're not on their side in all things.  Eight.  They gaslight you, manipulate you into questioning your own sanity or perception of reality.  You're expected to have faith that a god is real and created everything while leaving no evidence.  You're told to pray and you'll hear the voice of god, but only in your own head, obviously.  Nine.  Refusing to communicate.  I don't even need to elaborate on this one, do I?  Ten.  making threats again.  i don't need to say much more than do as i say or else hell i don't have eleven fingers.  i'll point up a pinky toe making everything your fault again.  i don't think i need to elaborate on this one.  twelve rigid gender roles in the relationship you know like women existing purely to serve their husbands.  I could probably go on, but the fact is that the God that's described to us by Christians, indeed by any of the Abrahamic religions, is kind of a dick and definitely abusive.  But we're told that such a guy is infallibly good and loves us in spite of, or even because of, how he mistreats us.  That's a huge contradiction, and it's one of the many reasons that I'm convinced he doesn't exist.  Even if there is another god out there somewhere, or even lots of them, this god can't possibly be real.  And even if I weren't a lesbian, I sure wouldn't want a boyfriend.  that's anything like this god.  Okay, so before I go, I've got another.  thank you.  Someone sent me a whole bunch of these.  These are seaweed snacks.  It's just nori paper, sushi paper, but, you know, bite size.  I absolutely love these things.  They're a great snack.  But, I wasn't just sent one or two.  This is a big honkin' box of them.  There was like, well, was, I say was, I ate so many already.  24 in here.  So, I want to give my thanks to, I'm assuming this is meant to be pronounced Japanese, Ukkonen Koira.  Okay, well, whoever you are, thank you for that.  I hope I pronounced that properly.  So, until next time, fellow space travelers, this is Bionic Dance saying don't run on automatic.  Instead, please think and eat sushi.  Go look on any website that describes warning size of an emotion... Warning size.  No, warning signs.  He decides that showing up in per... Blech.  It's because God expects us to think he's real by showing us things... Oi!  Can't say that line.  Having standards is one thing, but this comes with... Oh, farts.
