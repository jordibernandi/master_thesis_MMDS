And really one of the things that for that reason gives me the feeling I do about who Iowan voters are and the difference they make.  So I was here campaigning and preparing for the caucuses in 07.  I got to the headquarters, it was late, and they said, okay, is there anything else to be done tonight before the caucuses tomorrow?  And they said, well, there's a senior center that nobody's gone to yet.  Would you go?  So I went there.  And I started knocking on the doors of the various, you know, like studio apartments where these seniors were living, African-American senior home.  And, you know, invariably folks would answer the door.  And I remember at least a couple of them saying, oh, baby, come on in.  Can I give you a cup of coffee?  Oh, you know, you look a little skinny.  You want something to eat?  Yeah.  They always want to push you.  Always, always.  And then I knocked on this one door and the occupant answered the door.  the chain was on.
