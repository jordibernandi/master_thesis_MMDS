            "text": "Shalom.  Shalom, shalom to the 12 tribes of Israel that have been scattered worldwide.  This is Moray Yoshiyahu Dawi from the Awakening Remnant Coalition, known as the ARC, continuing our meditation moment.  And in our meditation moments, we are at this very important Psalm, Psalm number 14.  It's very informative about that fool who says there is no Elohim among the children of Israel, that he can't see it.  And we've already discovered that just because he can't see it because his head has been emptied out and he has become corrupt and wicked and disgusting and filthy, that Yah sees him though.  And when y'all looked at him, he said, there is none that do with good.  No, not one.  And this is what he's saying.  He's the Psalm writer.  I'm telling you, when you read Hebrew, you're going to get this.  The Psalm writer is saying, remember that word good is our word for functional.  Before it becomes like an English word, good, like something we like, it has to start off with the word to be functional, so they're not functional.  When you look in the world today, you're looking at dysfunction.  The gods of the heathens are gods of dysfunction, while the Elohim of the Hebrew Israelites is the Elohim of function.  So when he looks into other cultures and he looks into other nations, what he sees is dysfunction.  That's why he tells us not to be like our oppressor.  Don't envy the oppressor.  Don't be like the other nations.  Now Zion, we've been scattered into these nations.  They're all around us and therefore they're nasty, disgusting practices.  are all around us.  That's why we have to fight with everything in us to stay separated from this filthy world and these filthy heathens that we have been placed around.  Now I do want you to understand that the culture being filthy and confused and dysfunctional is a fact.  Anytime you don't have Torah, there's nothing good.  so you look at it and go well i think christmas is kind of good man.  no christmas is nasty dirty and filthy if you don't believe me.  just type in the origin.  find out what the real thing is.  not what they show you on top but what's going on behind the scenes and i've done so much video on that that even today uh one of the most uh one of the biggest times of sin and debauchery and of suicide, death, alcoholism, drug abuse.  adulteries, fornication, prostitution, fighting and wars and all that take place around the hell of days.  So I've done many videos on that to prove that the filthy source of that stuff is being made manifest in the practices.  While when we keep the culture and the custom and the feast days of Torah, it takes us back to a place of purity.  Well, then we are encouraged to get closer.  We just left Shavuot.  What did that do?  It took us back to a time where we received Torah.  So you have the children of men that are in contrast with the children of Yah.  He said they're all filthy and there's none good in that group.  Not one.  No, not one.  Then verse four, he says, have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge.  He says, are they all out of their mind?  Are they all stupid?  Are they all empty?  Are they all fools?  All of them.  And the answer to that is yes.  Yes, that's the truth.  The answer is yes.  Whether you like the answer or not, that rhetorical question, the answer is yes.  Listen.  he says all the workers of iniquity.  have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?  who eat up my people as they eat bread?  stop remember I told you the idea of filthiness has to do with you know your tongue touches something nasty whatever it is he says.  He says, using that same metaphor as filthy, he says, these people even eat other people.  Cannibals.  It's nasty.  They will actually eat the flesh of my people.  Now, let me explain the Hebrew idiom of eating the flesh of the people.  On one hand, it is exactly what it is.  that we got people on this planet who have us under their control or being oppressed by them, who believe it or not, will kill a Hebrew, Israelite, And if y'all don't know who the Hebrew Israelites are by now, they are the sons and daughters of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the 12 tribes, of which many were taken into captivity by the slave trade, the people that folk call black people.  They call them African-American.  They call them Afro-Cuban, Afro-South American, whatever they call them.  Listen, we've been scattered all over.  We discovered something.  We discovered that some heathens are actually eating us.  I know you think I'm lying.  Somebody's starting to Google right now.  They finding people who are killing black people and literally eating them, eating their flesh when they're dead, boiling them, cooking them and eating their dead flesh.  So when he said they eat my people, he's actually making a statement of truth.  These cannibals were killing Hebrews and actually eating them.  Why?  Because they don't have a problem eating unclean.  You don't eat people, but they eat people.  There's another word that has to do, oh, by the way, you need to meditate on that.  But there is another word of they eat my people up.  It is an idiom for taking advantage of them and eating up all their resources.  So that's what slavery does, obviously.  When a person comes and captures somebody and then takes them off the land and then takes their land, they've eaten up all their land.  Get the picture?  Then if they take all of their goods, Their wealth, they eat up all the wealth.  So you see the picture.  But watch this.  But when they get the actual people under their control, they then start eating the people.  In other words, they start taking everything out of the actual individual.  So that a person feels like nothing.  They feel like every day they are being consumed or destroyed.  So it is the heathen who eats up the people and the Hebrew word has to do with a bowl.  So when you get ready to eat something, right?  Most of the time, what you're gonna do is you put it on or you put it in a bowl or on a plate, something that can hold it.  And so the Hebraic picture is that they take the people and all their goods and all their wealth.  It's like they do it like they do a nasty pig or shrimp.  They put it on a bowl which is under their control and then they eat it, taking advantage of the people because they don't feel like they have nobody to fight for them.  So they eat the men and women's flesh.  That's what's going on in the world today.  and they eat up the flesh like they're eating bread.  Not my words.  I see why they didn't want us to read this Bible and read it slow for sure.  Who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon Yahuwah.  Oh no, they're not calling Yahuwah.  First of all, you see the word on there, it says the Lord.  That's another heathen lie.  He's never been called the Lord ever.  Like one of my brothers said, that's only in the matrix that you call Yah the Lord.  He's never, ever been called the Lord.  He's always called either the king or he's called Elohim or then he's got to be, or he's called, of course, Yahuwah.  So there it is.  And call not upon Yahuwah.  Verse five says, Woohoo!  I'm so glad we got to verse 5.  Verse 5.  There were they in great fear.  What?  Okay, so the psalm takes a drastic turn at this point.  While they were doing all this evil and filth and eating up the people like bread, all of a sudden it's like, boom, there they were in great fear.  So they were doing whatever they was doing, taking advantage of people, robbing the poor, stealing everybody's land, keeping them in slavery, holding them down, prostituting them, prostituting their gifts.  You know what I'm talking about.  Shooting them in the back.  oppressing in every side.  He says, and all of a sudden he looked up and all of them was shaking.  Every one of them was in fear.  Everyone was shaking.  It's like, wait a minute.  Is this the same cat who in verse one said there is no Elohim?  Then we get to verse five.  This same guy is shaking.  What has happened in verse five?  that has called him to fall into fear to where his knees is knocking so hard.  you can hear it all over the planet.  What has happened in verse five that has caused such great fear that he has soiled his draws to such a state?  is not a Clorox company in the world that could get the stain out?  What has happened in verse five that have made this heathen start shaking with fear?  Let me give it to you, Zion.  In verse five, he said they were in great fear.  Why?  For Yah is in the congregation of the righteous.  Their greatest fear, their greatest fear came to fruition.  What's their greatest fear?  that y'all would actually show up.  They were looking like, I don't see, I don't see.  We can do whatever we want to with these people.  We can be evil.  Then all of a sudden, y'all shows up and guess where y'all is?  Yah shows up and is hanging out with the very people that they called niggas, spooks, coon, porch monkeys, called them dirty, stupid, dumb, the folk that they was persecuting, prosecuting, shooting unrighteously, lynching, hanging, raping, cracking jokes every day, didn't want to give them reparation, and all of a sudden they worst fear.  You mean it's them?  And Yah shows up in that group, in that generation.  Not all of them.  The ones that are keeping Torah.  Yah shows up and he hangs out with them and it puts fear immediately in the heathen, in the fool, in the one bragging.  That's what King Dawid was writing Zion.  He was saying, man, when that greatest fear came to pass.  Oh, let it be anybody.  Just, here's what they say.  It could be anybody, but just not them nickels.  Not the nickels.  Please, let it.  The way we treated them, how we look at them, how we've taken advantage of them.  We robbed them.  They're spoiled.  They don't know their name.  They don't know their culture.  They don't know their history.  They don't know the name of the Yahuwah.  Now, all of a sudden, Yah shows up and he's one of them.  He's hanging around them.  What are they thinking?  We're dead.  It's over.  and they're right.  I'm gonna pause this video right here.  We hit that 15 minute mark.  So this is a good chance for me to stop and say to all the wicked people out there who have not yet turned to Yah and confessed the sins of your fathers and your own sins and you wanna continue to be, empty-handed stupid fool claiming that there will be no Elohim to show up in the midst of the congregation of the righteous of the scattered Israel while you have breath in your lungs.  you better take some time out now and repent and ask the most high to have mercy on you and open your eyes to the truth that you can see him now before you have to see him later.  I want you to meditate on that.  Shalom.  Help me get the keys to the kingdom.  Help me get the keys to the kingdom. ",
