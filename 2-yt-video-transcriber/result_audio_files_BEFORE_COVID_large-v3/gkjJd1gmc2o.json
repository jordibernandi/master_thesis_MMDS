I think the organizing principle of a society is money.  That's the reality of this society. ",

Absolutely.  No, because money ultimately relates to... Why do people want money?  Because money is a tool, and it's a tool to provide opportunity and volition.  Having money gives you the opportunity to exercise your volition.  And in that sense, money is not a fetish, it's not a god, it's not anything else.  It is simply a tool.  Those who have more money have more opportunities, have more opportunities to exercise their nature, to do good, to do evil, to exercise their volition.  And so, therefore, it is simply a reflection of everything else we're talking about. ",

You mentioned algorithms that nobody understands.  It's a bit of an exaggeration, but I do think there is some truth of that.  We are good at creating formal systems.  If you wanted me to characterize modern civilization, it is that it's a formal society.  We use formal rules to organize ourselves, and this has an amazing scalability.  We can run much larger societies than ever before.  But the downside is, of course, it might mean that you don't need the human relations.  And many of these scalable algorithms, whether they are software or in robots or in the form of bureaucratic rules governing a government or a university, take a life on their own.  And then you get what a very good blogger called a Moloch.  from the God who you had the child sacrifices to.  You set up something to give you value, whether that is a corporation or a government or a defense system.  And then it starts growing and it starts destroying value.  You still need to join up with it.  because it forces you or because it's the best thing to do.  And before you know it, you're working all the time and you don't have the time for those pleasures capitalism was supposed to give you or the government that was supposed to save the nation leads it straight into the abyss.  So I think these mollusks, they are the real threat. ",

So these are instruments in the hands of the human person.  And the instruments become whatever they become in the hands of the human person, the person who is using them.  He can use them for noble scopes and ends.  He can use them for evil, whatever scopes and ends.  So money is an instrument.  But when the pursuit of acquiring this, either to increase your ability to whatever type of thing, makes you subject everything to the acquisition of this instrument, then something is going awry.  Then we're getting, and it's happened.  It's happened, and in several other forms which contribute to some of the items on your list.  Human trafficking is to make money, and to feed brothels, to feed all of those with people so people can have whatever.  So there are cases where instruments take over and direct the pursuit and the aims of people in society and that is when instruments cease to become instruments and they become the values, the dominant values of people's lives.  and that's where sometimes we can be looking at evil.

It's worth remembering when evil came of age as a word that it would have been being talked about probably in Latin, and there is no distinction in Latin between evil and bad.  So suddenly it becomes a more manageable concept.  Marlem, they're both marlem, which is incidentally also the Latin word for apple, which is why in the Garden of Eden, Eden.  They eat an apple.  It's actually just a piece of fruit.  They just like the pun.  But my point is that while we would all hesitate, do you do evil?  No, I don't do evil.  Do you do bad?  Well, hmm.  And I actually think it's an easier discussion almost to think of the bad you do and the ways in which you do bad rather than evil.  And then suddenly you can see that with these many, many clicks that we do when we buy something from Amazon and and support an industry in which workers have no rights, that these are the evils, these tiny, tiny, tiny, incremental, dying by a thousand cuts, rather than evil that we do today is not... Evil sounds like me standing up from this chair, taking a sword and chopping someone's head off. ",
