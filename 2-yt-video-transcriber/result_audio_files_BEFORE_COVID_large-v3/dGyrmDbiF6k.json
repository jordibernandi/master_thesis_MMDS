            "text": "I've been reporting on how the media covers Bernie Sanders as a presidential candidate since his first run began back in 2015.  That's when Donald Trump rallies were getting wall-to-wall coverage.  Donald Trump talking about Obama right now.  Trump got 20 times more coverage than Sanders on TV networks during the primaries.  And Hillary Clinton got about twice as much airtime, a disparity noted by the New York Times public editor.  Are you saying that somebody's got their thumb on the scale at the New York Times for Hillary?  Yeah, yeah.  Bernie won 13 million votes in 22 states, but to see his rallies live, you often had to dial up C-SPAN.  This lack of coverage helped stall Sanders in 2016, but this time around, could the blackout actually help?  He's running up against this huge problem, though, that I mentioned earlier of this media blackout.  He often either gets ignored or kind of laughed at as not a serious candidate.  One thing standing between Sanders and serious coverage in 2020 is the media's belief that he simply can't win.  It's just you can't win as a social disaster.  I think the risk.  The guy's a recipe for electoral disaster.  And if Sanders can't win, the thinking goes, then it's justified to largely ignore him.  A recent study reveals that's exactly what MSNBC has done. ",

But the way Sanders is ignored could also be an advantage.  A pattern has emerged in presidential primaries.  Candidates rise, face media scrutiny, and then they drop in the polls.  Remember back to the 2012 Republican primary.  You saw it happen to Rick Perry, Herman Cain, and on and on.  This time, it's already happened to Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg could be next.  But what if the media pretend you're not rising at all?  Like when CNN puts Buttigieg and Joe Biden within striking distance of Elizabeth Warren while ignoring Bernie, the kind of thing that happens all the time.  Or when CNN puts Warren ahead of New Hampshire when she's not.  Leading the pack in both polls is Elizabeth Warren.  Or while MSNBC docked Sanders five points in a poll when he's actually gained five. ",

Let's face it, the corporate media was never going to anoint Bernie Sanders the nominee.  Maybe the best he can hope for is that they just stay out of his way. ",
