They know the authority, but they've not encountered the power, the Spirit of the living God, the baptism of fire that changes everything.  It's the two.  Jesus has made this available for every believer.  He's not just made it available.  It was never meant to be reduced to a doctrine that we could debate.  It was never meant to be reduced to an idea that we could analyze and that we could critique.  It was supposed to be something that makes you speechless once he's touched you and you don't know near as much after as you did before.  and the eloquence that you thought you had before the encounter suddenly vanishes as you find yourself babbling.  But your babbling has more power than all your profound statements because you've been possessed by fire, by the fire of the living God.  He told the disciples, After he showed up in Matthew 28, go ahead and turn there, even though you know the passage.  I like to see it in my own Bible, even though I can quote it.  Matthew 28, he says to them, in verse 18, All authority has been given to me.  in heaven and on earth.  Go therefore, make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things I've commanded you.  And lo, I'm with you always, even to the end of the age.  Jesus, in that commissioned, released to them the authority they would need to accomplish this assignment.  But he also mentioned in Luke 24, and I'll just read it to you or quote it to you.  Don't leave Jerusalem until you've been clothed with power.  What's happened here?  Jesus is raised from the dead.  The woman Mary grabbed him.  He says, don't Don't hang on to me.  I've got to go to the Father.  He presents the resurrected ones to the Father.  He comes back and he appears over a period of 40 days on numerous occasions to different ones, speaking of the things concerning the kingdom, telling them to stay in Jerusalem.  They're about to be clothed with power.  They didn't know what would happen.  They would just know it after it happened.  In this great moment, Jesus gives them the authority that he came to earth with.  In John 20, he said, As the Father has sent me, I send you.  So in other words, my assignment to destroy the works of the devil is now your assignment to destroy the works of the devil.  If I commanded you, I want to make sure that you command those who come to me through you.  Let's keep the same standard throughout the generations.  And then he says, but don't leave Jerusalem until you've had your own baptism of fire.  I believe the Lord wants to release a fresh baptism of fire.  I want you to stand. ",
