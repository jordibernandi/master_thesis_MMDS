            "text": "Good afternoon everyone.  NASA releasing the most startling news in years.  The next solar cycle is going to take us into a 200-year low in activity.  So start to look for the signs.  These jet streams are going to change.  The weakening magnetosphere and our new jet stream patterns and cloud cells are going to create massive floods that will continue.  Understand that what we're seeing across the corn growing zones in America with the late planting is just the beginning.  The rising corn prices that we're seeing is just the beginning.  The droughts amplifying in Eastern Africa, the floods in Northern Africa are just the beginning.  When dairy prices are rising 5.2% in April alone, And Christian Westbrook at Ice Age Farmer talking about the decimation of Chinese agriculture.  China's at the end game with industrial output, 17-year low, their banks are crashing, bailouts happening there.  And all of a sudden, Google updates the web traffic to pull away from cryptocurrency, to pull away from news outlets that are feeding you this information.  It's all just a little too coincidental, the timing on everything, to stem the flow of knowledge.  And during these times, I cannot reiterate how important it is going to be to grow your own food.  Are you going to do planter box, growing, wild crafting, whatever types of gardens you are going to need to grow your own food?  I highly suggest trueleafmarket.com, heirloom and organic seeds.  The links in the description box below.  They have free growing guides so you can start sprouting, planting, growing.  growing, experimenting.  Time's up.  Food is now becoming very valuable on this planet, and it will continue to do so from this point forward.  Now, those of you that have been following my channel, you'll know that I've been talking about a 400-year low in solar activity just on our doorstep, and this is going to massively affect global agriculture, and this in turn will affect the economy, and the very fabric of society will rip apart.  This is why I feel the police state has been unveiled since 9-11 to get ready for these changes without alerting the public.  because that 9-11 event just makes sense that you would need a police state out across the planet.  But here we are now, NASA confirming we are going into a 200-year low in solar activity.  We're starting now.  Not in 10 years, not in solar cycle 26 or the next next that everybody's been splitting hairs and arguing about.  It starts now.  I'm gonna try to explain what that means for you and I. moving forward.  After this next solar cycle, we're going directly into the 400-year low.  So starting now, it is going to get worse and more intense.  This year forward, up until 2035, your world is about to drastically change.  And I hope you understand the ramifications of where this is going.  We're going to take a look at the solar activity here.  NASA's calling 30% to 50% reduction from the last solar cycle, which would pretty much put us where that yellow trajectory is on the right side of the chart.  moving into the future.  We know what's happened in the past.  We know for sure that these jet streams are changing due to a weakening magnetosphere.  Changes in the sun, the magnetic field is spinning along in very unusual directions.  This magnetic wander is more than normal in terms of how much it's moving per year.  This is the wild card on top of the wild card.  But 100% for sure, these jet streams are moving into different locations and they shall continue to move further.  along with the cloud cells, the cloud patterns.  And they're going to collide in the atmosphere.  And when they do, jockeying for new position, you're going to start to see rain outs and different types of anomalous weather.  And the equatorial vortex pulling heat way north into the northern hemisphere.  And this polar vortex pulling cold incredibly far south As we move forward, it's all about the food prices.  And if you get anything from this video, it is about the food prices that they are trying to mask across the media, but it is so all-encompassing now that they can't.  They literally cannot control the flow of info anymore.  It is in every continent and it is global.  Even the Food and Agriculture Organization arm of the United Nations Dairy Price Index rising 5.2% in a single month.  It's going to continue to increase.  We're going to run through a bunch of other metrics here.  I highly encourage you to jump over to Ice Age Farmer, Christian Westbrook's channel, and check out his analysis on China, which I've also been working on, digging into the Chinese media.  These losses are so much greater than China is letting on.  If you know about the social credit score in China, they've mapped out everybody's purchasing habits over the last several years.  And now if you over-purchase food due to the scare factor, they're reducing your social credit score.  They're trying to keep everybody in check, assuring you that there's enough food when there absolutely is not.  And as we look into the United States, the worst planting, lowest acreage since 1938 in America, eclipsing even that low, 1938.  We have to go back almost 100 years to find anything this low in planting.  And the global population was far less than that.  There were far less people in the United States.  Here's the wild card.  When Trump and Xi have their new meeting, they're going to solve this impasse with the tariffs.  And the first purchase from China is going to be the biggest purchase in American history for corn, wheat, and soybeans.  China is behind the eight ball.  This army worm is devastating their corn crop.  I have 30% losses at the minimum so far.  And as we look at the global corn prices anyway, it is up and up.  They're looking for record highs above anything ever recorded ever in corn pricing globally.  So what happens when China comes to make this massive order and America does not have the corn to deliver?  What kind of signaling will that send across the market?  Sure, Brazil has some record production, another 100,000 tons.  Whoop-de-doo.  We just lost millions of tons.  So when we look also at the FAO, food prices globally for the fifth straight month up.  This last month in May, 1.2%.  Now averaging that over an entire year, that's almost 15% of food inflation.  people's wages are not rising at all.  See, we're coming right up into.  people are not going to be able to afford food shortly.  And if it continues.  the next year, that's a 30% rise.  And then the next year, we're up around 50%.  But the prices of food are going to continue to amplify up and up.  And it is all about the jet streams.  I encourage you to understand when the magnetosphere weakens how these jet streams are affected, how they move new precipitation patterns into new areas.  So what's forming now is going to form and continue to amplify in these next few years.  To make it simple, if it's getting wetter, it's going to continue to get wetter.  If it's drying and going into a drought condition, it's going to continue to dry.  These jet streams are moving into their new positions where they shall remain for decades, if not centuries.  The corporate mainstream media is not going to alert you to these food price rises.  No way.  They are right in tandem with the governments to maintain stability in society.  Everything is good.  If you really want to follow the news on the no plant or what's happening with American agriculture, you're going to have to reach out into Twitter, for example.  No plant.  19.  You're going to have to search through social media to get the real information.  How about the massive floods that have gone from Missouri down the Mississippi into Arkansas to all-time flooding?  Are you hearing about this on your local news?  Started in April, now that water flows clear down into Arkansas with these biggest floods they've ever had.  Are you seeing about the continued soaking of our farm fields across the Midwest?  Are you hearing about the sunken farm equipment that can't even get into the fields?  The way they're trying to assess that little tiny dry two acres over on the left there that's green for that entire circumference of fields that you see unplanted.  The USDA is using that emerged corn from that tiny little two acres next to the farmhouse there as their estimate for the corn output for this season.  Oh, discounting the other 3,000 acres that didn't get planted.  It looks great.  The emergence is looking good.  And everywhere you look, it is the same copy-paste, copy-paste Midwest flooding.  It's all the same.  Farmhouses underwater, historic delays, no plant, and the rains have continued and continued.  This is through June 12th, and as we look out into the future, Carlos Romero is giving us a precipitation forecast over the next 10 days.  More rain in these same areas, more massive flooding, no plant, chance to flood the fields further that are planted.  This is gonna be the largest loss that we have ever experienced on this planet.  In terms of this globalized society that we exist in, this is it.  There's never been anything this large in terms of losses.  When you're looking at jet streams moving in new places, we're seeing it everywhere.  These precipitation totals are literally off the charts.  Looking at some places in Colorado with 437% of their snow talls, meaning 4.3 times the average.  And then we look over into Africa, Eastern Africa.  While it dries, Northern Africa begins to turn into a fertile grow zone.  And also Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, these areas look for South Africa for imports.  But because of the politics there, they're going offline completely like Zimbabwe did.  Severe drought leading to East African food crisis.  We see massive drought.  That is going to continue to dry.  If you look at the mid-Holocene or the 2,000 year rainfall patterns, which I think we're repeating, not a 400 year cycle, this area is going to continue to dry.  But when we get up to North Africa, this is also very interesting because it's following the mid-Holocene 6,000 year pattern or the 2,000 year pattern where Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, which just had record wheat harvest by the way, are continuing to flood and get enormous amounts of new rainfall.  And the massive floods spreading across the Middle East, Afghanistan, and when you look at areas like this and rivers that haven't flowed in thousands of years.  being in this inundated with flood waters, you know something's changing.  And to put it into perspective, this is the Roman grain growing area of North Africa.  The rain is returning.  And what I believe will happen is North Africa will become one of the largest bread baskets on the planet.  Taking a look at Accra in Ghana, rainfall so heavy in minutes.  This is how much water came down out of the atmosphere, flooding expressways, by roads, trapping residents, washing away villages in minutes.  And we see the same thing in Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, where 50% of their farm fields are underwater as well.  And keep in mind, Bulgaria produces 13% of all the corn in the EU underwater just like the United States.  And again, if we are going into 200 year low solar activity followed quickly by a precipitous drop into something we just haven't experienced before as a society in the 400 or 2000 year cycle, snows are going to come in June.  Our seasons for growing food will be greatly diminished.  These June snows and record cold temperatures are here.  Take a look up in Kashmir for a moment.  This much snow in June.  Now Kashmir is low.  It's not in the top of the Himalayan mountains like you might think as a convenient excuse.  Oh, it's in the Himalaya.  It can snow anytime.  Not in Kashmir.  It's very lush, very temperate.  And then when we see headlines of subtropical parts of Australia, extremely rare snowfalls in Queensland and New South Wales.  The volcanic eruptions are going to continue to uptick.  Now this is truly what's going to start dropping our temperatures.  The sun going into a low solar activity phase is one thing.  But when the volcanoes start to go off as they do every single grand solar minimum, we're going to get ash and particulate in the atmosphere that's going to reflect sunlight and drop temperatures further.  Equatorial eruptions are the most dangerous because that goes into the cloud cells both north and south from the equator.  Cinnabon, 55,000, that then moved up to 65,000 feet, multiple eruptions.  Now the Mexican volcano is gonna have more of a regional effect on the United States and Mexico, North America.  42,000 to 45,000 feet, and they had 187 ash ejection events in a 24-hour period.  We see all across the West Coast rumblings, quake swarms, unusual activity as ash pervades the atmosphere.  Got tar and natural gas oozing out of sidewalks in California.  The pressure under our Earth is building, which would be expected during the grand solar minimum due to increased galactic cosmic rays.  And it's all about the economy.  It's all about can people eat?  Can we still trade?  What can we trade?  Will people still buy?  And what we're seeing in Chinese activity, 17-year low in industrial output, meaning people have bought everything that they need.  There's very little need for new stuff, if you will.  The world is saturated in stuff.  Goods, we don't need anymore.  Hey, if CO2 is such a bad pollutant, we should stop all commerce anyway, shouldn't we?  Because you know, CO2 is so runaway, it's an extinction-level event.  We should stop all corporate manufacturing.  Everything stops on a dime to save the planet.  This is all tied to the debt cycle.  The debt cycle has run its course completely.  There's no more growth for us.  In terms of a globalized society of one country consumes debt to produce product, to sell it, and that cycle has run its course completely.  Chinese banks are failing just like Lehman Brothers.  Chinese bank is into the third major bailout so far.  And I will say it again, when President Trump and the Emperor Xi meet together, this tariff will work itself out magically.  And the first thing that China will do is sign the largest trade deal ever for the import of food from America over to China.  Now with the losses in corn, will they be able to fill those orders?  Will they move to soybeans to make it appear that there's enough food to fill those orders?  China lost 200 million pigs due to the swine flu.  Their fruit prices are out of control.  The army warrant is decimating their corn production.  And all the while, the Chinese media assures its citizens there's enough food.  Don't panic buy.  Your social credit score will lower if you panic buy food.  And then we have Google updating so the news and the web traffic plummet across some certain types of media where you get your information.  Magically random happenstance would be all of the crypto news got pulled on the algo.  Daily Mail and other types of news media reporting on the grand solar minimum, crop losses and increasing food prices and instability in countries rioting mainly based on food rises.  Those are pulled down in the web traffic results as well.  This is an all out effort to mask, disguise and prolong as long as the corporate interests can the stability of society.  Because when you see the FAO reversing sharply downward forecast made in May on global cereal production due to the losses in China, due to the losses in the United States, subtracting billions of bushels of corn out of their estimates, and then world cereal stocks decline as much as 3% in the new season, I thought we were supposed to be increasing production, yet we're lost for the third year in a row declines.  And if I'm anywhere on point, the ethanol production in the United States will be greatly affected.  They're going to ration corn and pull it away from the ethanol producers to put it back into human consumption and animal feed to try not to allow prices to rise too quickly.  Because when we look at the corn price, it's already above the five-year highs.  It is going into the highest prices ever seen, along with wheat.  And your food prices are going to quickly follow, but your wages aren't.  This is the end game.  I truly wish this video is writing on the wall for you that you see how this future is going to unfold in front of us.  You're going to have to grow your own food.  You should begin buying supplies right now that last for a longer amount of time.  Bulk goods, dried goods to keep.  They're going to go up in price as well.  The media is not going to warn you at all.  They're going to let you drive at 100 miles an hour into the wall with no airbag on this one.  You're on your own.  You should begin preparing now.  This news release from NASA is a soft lean into informing the public on what's going on.  As I've said from the beginning of the channel, 2021 is when the world completely understands what is happening, where we're going with this, and when the awareness is there, everybody's going to run at the exact same time to buy the exact same goods.  You have less than a year to do what you need to do to prepare before the masses spook and run and panic.  Thank you for watching.  Hope you got something out of the video.  And if you'd like more information on the Grand Solar Minimum, in addition to Twitter, Facebook, and all the regular media outlets, Mines and Steemit, where I'm putting everything like this in a written format so you can copy the charts, PDFs you can share with your friends and family.  And remember, every single week on Patreon, if you support me there, I'm sending out PDFs on explaining some of these charts that I use in the videos so you can print them off and then talk to others, your friends and family, to get them aware as well.
