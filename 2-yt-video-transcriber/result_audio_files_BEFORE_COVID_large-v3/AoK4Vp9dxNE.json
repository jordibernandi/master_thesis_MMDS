            "text": "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  Turn thine to the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever.  Amen.  Where people give men their trespasses, where his father will offer to give you.  Where people give not men their trespasses, neither will his father give you your trespasses.  Amen.  So all we come out here to do is preach to our people who we really are, right?  The Sunday church is alive in everybody.  They tell you that Christmas is sanctified.  They tell you that Christmas is in the Bible.  But where's Christmas lined up in the Bible?  Nowhere do you find Christmas or Santa Claus or Christ being born on December 25th.  Why do we celebrate these holidays?  Why do we celebrate these things?  These things are pagan.  None of this is recorded in the scripture.  Where do they get the Christmas tree from?  The Christmas tree is not in the Bible.  In fact, the Bible preaches against the Christmas tree, right?  Everybody says they believe in God.  Everybody says they follow the Bible.  But where's these holidays in the Bible?  Right?  Did Christ celebrate Christmas?  If you say you're a Christian, why do you celebrate Christmas?  Right?  Give me Jeremiah chapter 2.  Right?  Colossians 3 and 17.  The book of Colossians, chapter 3 and verse 17.  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, you all in the name of the other one, Yahushua, give thanks to the God and the Father by him.  So everything we do, we do in the name of Amashiach, Yahushua, who the world ignorantly calls Jesus Christ.  Because we know there was no J in the ancient tongue.  We know there was no J in the Hebrew.  So how could his name be Jesus?  Right?  We follow a man named Hamashiach Yahushua who the world ignorantly calls Jesus Christ.  Let's get Jeremiah chapter 10.  Right?  Because this is a wicked day that everybody is celebrating.  I know you guys want to celebrate.  You come in love.  They give you the day off.  They give you the week off.  And you want to get with your family.  But we have to do things in righteousness.  We have to do things in righteousness, right?  Give me Jeremiah chapter 10.  The book of Jeremiah, chapter 10, verse 1.  Hear ye the word which the Most High is speaking unto you.  Right, so hear the word, children of Israel.  You Israelites, you blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.  Read on.  O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord.  Thus saith the Lord.  When it says thus saith the Lord, this is a commandment.  Things we ought to do and ought not to do.  Read on.  Learn not the way of the heathen.  So it says learn not the way of the heathen.  Why does it say that?  Why does it say learn not the way of the heathen?  Let's see what it's talking about.  Keep reading.  And be not dismayed at the signs of heaven.  Right?  Keep reading.  For the heathen are dismayed at them.  Keep reading.  For the customs of the people are vain.  So let's see what it's talking about.  It says the customs of the people are vain.  What does vain mean?  It means you are doing it for no reason.  It has no purpose for our Heavenly Father.  Right?  Read on.  For one cut the tree out of the forest.  So this is what you guys do.  You cut the tree out of the forest.  Right?  This is talking about Christmas.  You cut the tree out of the forest.  So not only do you cut this tree out of the forest, you cut it with the axe, you take it out of the forest, then you deck it with silver and gold.  The scripture says, learn not the way of the heathen.  We are not supposed to be doing these things.  Why isn't the church addressing these matters?  Right?  He read it.  They fasten it with nails and with hammers.  Right, so when they put this tree in their house and then they deck it with silver and gold, they fasten it with nails and hammers so that it what?  Read on.  That it move now.  So that it can't move, that it can stay in one spot.  Read on.  They are upright as the palm tree.  They are upright.  These Christmas trees stand upright as the palm tree.  Read on.  But speak not.  They don't speak.  Read on.  They must needs be born.  Meaning you have to carry them into your house.  He read it.  Because they cannot go.  They cannot go.  They can't move.  Read on.  Be not afraid of them.  Uh-huh.  Read on.  For they cannot do evil.  Keep reading.  Neither also in it them to do good.  It is not in them to do good.  This Christmas tree is bad.  This is wicked.  This is to be a holiday.  Right?  Where is this reported in the Bible?  Who made up this holiday?  Who made up Christmas?  Who told you to take a Christmas tree and put it in your house?  Read verse 2 again, right?  Because it says something, right?  Read on, read on.  The book of Jeremiah, chapter 10, verse 2.  Thus saith the Lord.  This is thus saith the Lord.  Read on.  Learn not the way of the heathen.  So we just read about this Christmas tree.  It says learn not the way of the heathen.  These things are what heathens do.  This is not our custom, right?  This is what happened.  Let me explain something, right?  When they took us out of slavery, they took us from our homelands, right?  They drug us over here, and now we celebrate days that do not belong to us.  We celebrate things that are in vain to us, right?  The reason why we went into slavery in the first place is because we broke the commandments of God, right?  Where you from, brother, if you mind me asking?  You from here?  So-called Caucasian or what?  What's your background?  Puerto Rican, Borica, right?  So you would be from the 12 tribes of Israel.  That's right.  You would be an Israelite, right?  Would you say Puerto Ricans are treated fairly, right?  You say they grouped in with the so-called black men, right?  What we get done to us, right?  They do horrendous things to us.  But nobody has ever paid for the crimes and the atrocities that have been done.  What I'm coming out here to do is tell my people is that we cannot partake of the heathens on these holidays.  This is a heathen custom.  It says learn not the way of the heathen.  We can't cut these Christmas trees out of the forest and then deck them with silvery gold, right?  These things ought not to be done.  Right?  Right?  Give me your Deuteronomy chapter 2, verse 15.  Right?  Because what we come out here to do is tell our people the truth.  Right?  We telling y'all the truth.  Let me ask y'all a question.  Would y'all say that the black man is treated fairly in America?  No?  But why is that?  You say what?  Say that one more time, I can't hear you.  A story of oppression, but why are we oppressed, right?  When you look at us, you know that we're a strong people, right?  Right?  You know that we're a smart people.  So how do we get in this condition to be on the bottom?  We're still on the bottom of society to this day, right?  You said what?  It's the devil that wants to divide us.  Could you say that we're all one people?  In Christ?  So you believe in, do you believe Christ died for everybody?  Give me X529.  Let me show you something, right?  Because a lot of times, what happens is we go to church and they try to group us as one nation.  What do they make us do in the schools?  They say, pledge of allegiance under God, one nation, one nation under God, right?  But that's not true, right?  You brought here against our will and we have been made to serve up until this day, right?  When you look at the black man, the Native American, you know that no justice has ever been done for them, right?  You believe in karma, right?  You don't believe in karma?  So you don't believe something you do will come back to haunt you?  If you're an evil man, you don't think evil will come back to get you?  Okay, let's see.  Acts 5.29.  Let me show you something.  The book of Acts, chapter 5 and verse 29.  You guys believe in God?  Christians?  The book of Acts chapter 5 and verse 29.  Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, we ought to obey God rather than man.  So this is where we've been bamboozled because we listen to man in the Sunday church.  But the Sunday church is false.  That's a wicked religion.  Right?  They don't preach out of the Bible.  They preach by precepts of men.  But we're coming out the Bible to them.  Right?  Read on.  The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hang on a tree.  The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom they slew and hung from a tree.  Right?  Doesn't that sound familiar?  like the black man, what they were doing to us?  Right?  Read on.  Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior.  To be a prince and a savior.  Read on.  For to give repentance to Israel.  To who?  To Israel.  To Israel.  To everybody.  To Israel.  To all of America.  To Israel.  To Africa.  To Israel.  To Israel.  So what you are looking at is the true Israelites according to the Bible.  That's right.  We are the real Jews.  That's right.  Give me Jeremiah 17 and 4.  Because I'm going to give you guys a history lesson really quick.  Wait, how did you come to that conclusion?  How did we come to the conclusion?  When you read the scriptures.  I'll show you.  I'll show you.  I'm going to go through a couple of scriptures and I'm going to line them up for you, right?  Jeremiah 17 and 4.  The book of Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 4.  And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage.  Thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage.  So when you guys, when your forefathers brought us over here on slave ships, right?  Okay.  And you know what's funny?  I hear a lot of you say that, but I want to know, show me the white man to this day that says his forefathers had us enslaved.  Everybody will, they will never admit that you guys had us enslaved.  I don't know why that is.  Somebody, somebody participated in those crimes.  Right?  My family came here 100 years ago.  Okay, so hold on.  I'll get to that.  What I'm trying to tell you is that we've worked against our will.  We were brought here against our will.  Right?  And we lost our heritage.  We speak a tongue that does not belong to us.  We still carry the last names of our slave masters.  Right?  You guys don't have that issue.  But we have an identity issue on our hands.  Right?  Give me Amos 1 and 11.  Let me show you something.  Because scriptures tell us that, you know, your people and our people have different characteristics.  A different manner of people.  You guys would agree that we're not the same people, right?  As far as mannerism.  We don't move the same.  Huh?  Huh?  Okay, I'll take that.  Amos 1 and 11, read that.  The book of Amos, chapter 1 and verse 11.  Thus said the Lord, for three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof.  Right, so there's a punishment that he cannot turn away from the so-called white man.  When you read the scriptures in Genesis 25 and 21, it goes to the breakdown.  Where the white man comes from and where the black man comes from.  You come from, your forefathers are, is named Esau, right?  Coming out of Edom, right?  So it says, for three transgressions, right?  He cannot turn back his anger.  Read on.  Because he did pursue his brother with a sword.  And did cast.  Your forefathers pursued us with a sword.  Hold on, where you going?  You gotta go?  Give me two seconds.  Hold on, let me just, let me educate you real quick, man.  Don't be rude like that.  We're having a conversation, right?  Don't be rude like that, man.  Right?  And I'm not being rude about it.  I'm just telling you the truth.  I'm heading out.  You're heading out?  Alright, let me just show you this last scripture real quick.  Read on, read on.  It did cast of all pity.  Read again from the sword.  Alright, what do you want to say?  What do you want to say then?  I love you.  I can't shake your hand.  Do you feel sorry for what our forefathers and ancestors have been through?  I'm sorry for what our ancestors have been through.  Are you 100% sure?  bring it out hold on wait hold on wait wait wait hold on don't run.  you guys say.  you guys say you are sorry right well we're gonna see because scripture scripture is very detailed on how you guys are gonna tell us.  right right.  let's see isaiah 49 and 23 the book of isaiah chapter 49 verse 23 and kings shall be thy nursing fathers.  Kings are gonna be thy nursing fathers, read on.  And their queens, thy nursing mothers.  Right, so the people that own this earth, Trump, right, Donald Trump, Bush, all of these people, they're gonna be our nursing fathers, just like we were to them, right, to your forefathers, read on.  They shall bow down.  They shall do what?  They shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth.  Now, are you willing to bow down with your face toward the earth to apologize to the true Hebrews according to the Bible?  Right?  Right?  Hallelujah.  Keep reading.  Stay down there.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Stay down there.  Stay down there.  Put your face toward the earth.  Read on.  And lick up the dust of thy feet.  Lick up the dust of thy feet.  Can you kiss his boot really quick?  If you're there, sorry.  Right?  And kiss his too because his forefathers wouldn't do the same thing.  Right?  Right?  Right?  And that shows some humility.  Right?  Uh-huh.  That's fine.  So what I need for you to do is go and tell your people the same thing.  Because you guys don't understand what has happened to us.  Up until this day, we get shot down, we have been murdered, and we have been raped.  Our fathers, our sons, our daughters are still suffering to this day for what has happened from slavery.  Right?  So the best thing you can do at this point is go back to your people and say, look, we messed up.  We did these things to the real Jews and God has it out for you.  Right?  And you got to help every single black man that you see.  If you see him struggling on the street, you give him all the money in your pocket.  Right?  If you see him struggling, if he needs food, you give him something to eat.  That's what you can do at this point.  Right?  Because for so long we've been counting for madness and so long we've been counting for nothing.  Right?  This whole system was built against the black man.  This entire system.  So what's going to happen for these people?  Right?  Give me Ezekiel chapter 25.  What's that?  25 and 15 or 14?  It's about... I'm just... Go ahead, go ahead.  Go ahead.  This has to be... My people are leaving, so... That's fine.  I'll listen to this, and then I'll... All right, cool.  Obadiah 1 and 18.  All right.  We go back to the hood and we go back to our neighborhoods.  You don't understand the struggles that we face from what you guys have done to us up until this day.  Read that.  The book of Obadiah, chapter 1, verse 18.  And the house of Jacob shall be a fire.  So the house of Jacob, which is us, we're going to be a fire.  Read on.  And the house of Joseph, a fire.  Uh-huh.  And the house of Esau.  The house of Esau, which is where you come from.  Read on.  For stubble.  For stubble.  We're going to burn you guys.  Simple.  Read on.  And they shall kindle in them.  not be any remaining of the house of Esau.  So that's the judgment to your people, what you guys have done to us, right?  That's the judgment.  No, you can't be.  We just read that Christ only died for Israel.  He cannot be.  Christ was only a messenger for Israel, right?  Let me ask you, what's your name?  AJ.  AJ?  Yes.  You said you love the Messiah, right?  So, did not the Messiah walk here?  Give me that sign right there.  Is this the Messiah?  So, if he walked here, the West Palm Beach right now, how would he look?  Because now this image, he said what?  Like you guys.  Like us, right?  So now, we should look at it as a case of identity, because what was the nationality of the Messiah?  What was it?  He was from the Middle East.  Give me Hebrew.  Okay, so all through society, we've been seeing lives that have been taught, right?  They taught your people, they taught our people.  But before every great people were destroyed, what did the Middle-Side God do?  Before every people were destroyed, what did God do?  We read about the Persians and the Medes, Egypt, Babylon.  what is the most I've done?  Son of man, Gamal.  Well, before he came, he brought the judgment.  He sent forth his servants, the prophets, the forefathers in that kingdom, right?  Read that.  Hold on a minute.  Is this the Messiah?  Who's that?  Who's that?  He's the wife of Zipporah.  Read that.  Speak of Hebrews, chapter 1, verse 1.  God, who has such right times, By which you're going to find out that you've been lied to by your pastors, by your preachers.  We are living in the last days of the world.  The book of Hebrews, chapter 7, verse 14.  For it is evident.  What is what?  For it is evident.  The Bible says that it is evident.  What does evident mean?  That it's crystal clear.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Come on.  That our Lord.  That what?  That our Lord.  Our Lord, who you call Jesus Christ.  Come on.  Sprang out of Judah.  Christ came out of the tribe of Judah.  Hooray!  Okay, the fourth born son of Jacob.  Give me Jeremiah 14 verse 2.  You are standing before the true servants of God.  The real children of Israel according to the Torah and according to the Bible. ",
