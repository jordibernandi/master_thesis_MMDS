            "text": "Howdy Droogs, Kel here.  Well, I'm on the back deck above the hatch of the abandoned missile silo where I live, and I'm here to smoke an L. Ray Moodle For DeLonzo.  I call it DeLonzo, but that's not the only way to pronounce it.  It's a Maduro.  It has a nice Maduro smell to it.  I thought to start off with, I would show you how to cut a cigar like this.  Some of you guys, you know you guys with the cigar smoke can run into these weird shaped cigars.  This is called a Pyramid.  It's real pointy on the top.  Now there's also something called a Bellicoso, I think it's called, which has a similar kind of shape, but this is a Pyramid.  These have a real pointy shape on top like this.  Now, it's really not complicated.  You just take the cigar and your teeth like this, and you just rip it off.  Watch.  Don't do that.  It just, it still has a cap on, like a regular cigar.  A little cap right there.  You may not be able to see too easily, but it's right there, a little cap.  And you just take your cigar cutter, and you just select a place.  You don't want to cut the entire cap off, just like with any other cigar.  So you set the place.  I go in about this far initially.  Some guys don't want to have less space.  We'll just go small here to start with.  Get your blades on there a little bit, then you press toward the cigar, just like any other cut, and then you cut.  Now, I find cigars like this, with this kind of a cap, kind of a top, generally need to be cut in a little farther than this because this hurts the draw.  Generally, I find that cigars with this kind of a shape, this part here gets a little wound too tight.  And it's the case of this cigar here.  So we will cut another little section off.  Well, that's about perfect, actually.  You can see you get a cigar with a bit of a, kind of a similar shape still, but a little bit different.  Well, that's all there is to it.  Just make sure you kind of note where the cap is on the cap on this cigar.  It seems to be coming to right about here.  And you don't want to cut the entire cap off of your cigar rolling around, just like with a regular cigar.  But that's about all there is to it.  Well, that's it.  Thanks for watching.
