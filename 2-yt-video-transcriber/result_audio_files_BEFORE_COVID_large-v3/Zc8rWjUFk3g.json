            "text": "Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing well.  In today's video, we're going to explore a few of the reasons behind why it seems that celebrities are losing their influence.  Now granted, a number of celebrities still do hold a level of influence, some more than others.  But interestingly enough, the studies are showing that social media influencers now hold more sway over their fans than traditional celebrities when it comes to marketing deals.  And as for political influence, we all remember how many big name celebrities Hillary Clinton trotted out over the course of her campaign.  Katy Perry, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Oprah, Lena Dunham, and so on.  But their endorsements proved to fall flat in the end.  Trump, on the other hand, was only endorsed by a few celebrities, but he still took the victory.  Roughly 60% of Americans say stars' public causes won't impact their personal midterm choices, a 2018 Hollywood Reporter Morning Consult poll found.  But most won't boycott films or TV either.  Respondents don't think the views of celebrities impact them, with only 24% saying that performers are very or somewhat effective at swaying them politically.  Only 11% of those surveyed say they've made a donation or volunteered for a cause because a star has encouraged them to do so.  Celebrities don't have much influence, says Alex Conant, a Republican political strategist who worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign.  If anything, from a Republican perspective, being attached by a liberal celebrity can be a badge of honor.  Democrats, 55%, are seen by respondents as far more likely than Republicans, 31%, to be influenced by celebrity opinions.  From what I can discern, one of the biggest reasons why the spell of celebrity adoration seems to be breaking is social media.  The reason for this is that by having a Twitter account, for example, the true personalities of the celebrities are put on full display for all the world to see exposing many of them for the insufferable and oftentimes cruel NPCs that they are.  Rosanna Arquette, I'm sorry I was born white and privileged.  It disgusts me and I feel so much shame.  Peter Henry Fonda, we should rip Barron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if his mother will stand up against the giant asshole she is married to.  Kathy Griffin, about the Covington Catholic Boys, tweeted, The reply from the school was pathetic and impotent.  Name these kids.  Shame them.  If you think these effers wouldn't dox you in a heartbeat, think again.  Sarah Silverman.  effing white people.  Debra Messing, in response to the news that Trump would appear at a Beverly Hills fundraiser during Emmys week, she called for all the attendees to essentially be doxxed.  Please print a list of all attendees, please.  The public has a right to know.  Pop singer Madonna, who said in a profanity-laced speech at the Women's March in Washington, DC in 2017, that she had thought about, quote, blowing up the white house lena dunham sitting here contemplating how white men literally cry so hard when they're cancelled lol bett midler.  women are the n-word of the world raped beaten enslaved married off worked like dumb animals denied education and inheritance enduring the pain and danger of childbirth and life in silence for thousands of years.  They are the most disrespected creatures on earth.  Robert De Niro has lashed out at stupid Donald Trump, admitting, I'd like to punch him in the face.  I mean, he is so blatantly stupid.  He's a punk, a dog, he's a pig.  says a visibly angry De Niro in the Vice exclusive video.  Brie Larson, I don't want to hear what a white man has to say about a wrinkle in time.  I want to hear what a woman of color or a biracial woman has to say about the film.  I want to hear what teenagers think about the film.  Johnny Depp, when was the last time an actor assassinated a president?  Depp's joke in reference to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth in 1865 was made during an appearance at the glastonbury festival.  i want to qualify.  i am not an actor i lie for a living he added at the uk music festival.  however it has been a while and maybe it is time youtubers influencers or whatever you prefer to call them.  they generally get famous on the other hand due to their personalities for example somebody like PewDiePie, or for their ability to offer something of value to their viewers, humorous videos, how-to videos, and analytical videos in regards to entertainment, news, and so on.  YouTubers and social media influencers are oftentimes a lot more relatable than celebrities, not to mention many of them.  allow for a lot less distance between them and their fans, which makes it easier for their fans to create a genuine bond with them.  There also exists a ton of hypocrisy in celebrity circles nowadays.  For example, they order us to take in millions of quote-unquote refugees while simultaneously living safely inside the walls of giant gated mansions.  Or they preach to us about the dangers of climate change while simultaneously taking private jets everywhere they go.  While it's certainly part of human nature to fail to live up to one's own principles every now and again, publicly advocating for something while also publicly doing the exact opposite definitely isn't a good look.  Not to mention, the average person just detests pompous artificiality, no matter how famous and rich the person spewing it might be.  I also think that, as a part of human nature, we desire role models to look up to, to admire, and perhaps even to mimic.  In the past, when we didn't have social media, there wasn't much opportunity for us to see the true character of celebrities.  Interviews weren't ideal as they're often edited and many of the questions are pre-approved.  So as a result, many people liken celebrities' personalities to those of the characters they played in their films.  In fact, it still happens even nowadays.  Seeing people actually refer to Chris Evans as Captain America on Twitter is cringeworthy to say the least.  The characters of celebrities in the past were shrouded in a lot more mystery than they are nowadays, so even if back then they were secretly insufferable and cruel, few would have known it.  Fortunately for us, though, nowadays social media has completely shattered this illusion.  While of course you still do have some people who remain blind, who hang on to each and every word that their favourite celebrity utters, There are many other people who have snapped out of it, and who are choosing not to make role models out of the people that our degenerate, soulless, and broken society upholds as heroes.  I personally find the shift away from celebrity worship to be a great and also kind of unsurprising thing.  It's perfectly understandable why people would want a real person to look up to and admire, rather than a carefully crafted NPC.  And it's also perfectly understandable why people would want genuine role models, not just in what they say, but also in what they do.  On the other hand, though, I do have to admit that I don't judge too harshly the people who who do choose to look up to celebrities and the like, even if I find it to be a bad thing.  Because as I mentioned previously, we naturally crave role models.  And the sad truth is that we have very few good role models, very few strong and upright leaders in our society today.  So in the same way that when our culture of victimhood started running out of problems to fix, it created false problems to tackle in their stead, when we started running out of good role models, We created false role models to worship in their stead.
