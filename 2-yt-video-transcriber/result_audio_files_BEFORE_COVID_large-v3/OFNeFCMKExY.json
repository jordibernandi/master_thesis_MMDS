And it also has its own Patreon.  now, since we gotta divide that income between three people, right?  So, go over there to that other channel to watch the next episode, which should be uploaded by now.  That link is in the description, and there's going to be an end card, so you can just click the button.  I think the first five episodes are going to stay here, because I don't feel like re-uploading them all, because it'd take like two days straight.  And the RSS feed is also coming very soon, as is Franklin episode 11, which is going to be on banking and the economy of the United States before 1840.  Okay, right.  That's it.  Go away now. ",
