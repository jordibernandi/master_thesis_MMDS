Los Angeles is the global leader in urban congestion, worse than Delhi, Beijing, or anywhere on the planet.

Angelenos spend an average 104 hours stuck in traffic jams every single year.  The smog in LA is so bad, sunsets look like nuclear bomb blasts.  They also have something called purple alert days, which means if you go outside and breathe, you basically just get cancer and die.  LA is also a death trap for pedestrians and cyclists.  Pedestrian fatalities from being hit by a car are triple the national average, while cyclist fatalities are double the national average.

A poll found that for the first time since the 92 riots, there is an increase in the number of people living in Los Angeles who fear that more civil unrest is likely within five years.

He was actually trounced.  I lived in LA for 20 years until I left a year ago.  Rents are skyrocketing, number of homeless is increasing dramatically as they are in Orange County.  I've never seen so many rats and needles in the streets.  The trash is mountainous.  Not kidding.  It's slowly but surely becoming the city from the movie Idiocracy.  It's horrible.  Homeless tents everywhere, in the valley and all the surrounding areas as well.  Trash, drugs, smell of urine all over.  Getting worse.  In summary then... Not great.  It's fine.

So long as they can be privately chauffeured around, so long as they can retreat to the safety of their Beverly Hills mansions, so long as they can avoid the immediate consequences of the squalor, and so long as the miserable underclass keeps voting Democrat and fixing their toilets, They don't care.

But does any of this matter, given that Los Angeles is probably going to be wiped out by natural disasters anyway?  Thanks to the San Andreas Fault, one big earthquake could devastate the city.
