            "text": "Hey folks, it's Patreon Heirs.  Today I wanted to discuss the great falling away and the coming persecution of Bible believers in the United States.  What's got my wheels turning on?  this one is over the past few weeks we've had a couple of people who are quite highly visible in the evangelical Christian community come out and say, to paraphrase, that they are living a lie.  They're apologizing, in the case of Joshua Harris, for things that they taught which were biblical.  And in the case of Joshua Harris, taking pictures of themselves at grades, celebrating things that are clear abomination in scripture.  And the reason why I am concerned about this, friends, is because if you have ever studied the animal kingdom, you will note that apex predators are most likely to attack an individual in a herd, or the herd in general, when they perceive that members of the herd are weak or sick, less effective, cowardly.  A lot of moral cowardice.  A lot of moral cowardice.  But friends, the thing that has been prescient in my mind over here is that we have been setting up for persecution in the United States against Bible believers for a great long time.  And I'm not talking about denominations.  I am not interested in that at all.  I am talking about organized persecution, consolidated persecution of the state.  and of its little minions, emissaries of the state, against people who are attempting to the best of their ability to lead lives that are governed by the Bible.  And when you have leaders, right, who have spent decades of their lives amassing essentially a cult of personality, definitely in the case of Joshua Harris, a many-published author.  I'm sure he's going to publish another book telling everybody how he got it wrong so he can go the next round with it.  But when you have leaders like this that are coming out and that are encouraging people to pathologically doubt and to invest in pathological doubt versus honest, intellectual, critical analysis, that is troubling.  Because when I look at the hallmark of the enemy, it is doubt.  Doubt, doubt, doubt.  And there is a sea of doubt and a spirit of doubt that is pervasive right now.  Doubt about what this country is and what it was founded on and what it's supposed to be, a constitutional republic and not a socialist utopia.  doubt about the very foundations of biology, doubt about what doctrine really is, what did Scripture really say.  And when I evaluate, when I evaluate within the totality of the body of Scripture, times and incidences in which pathological doubt reared its head, it sounds something eerily similar to this.  Did God really tell you It's written that they will bear you up in their hands, throw yourself off the doubt, pathological doubt.  It has all of the hallmarks of wickedness upon it.  It's one thing to honestly and humbly question.  It's an entire different thing to sow seeds of doubt and to invest in doubt and to support doubt and to celebrate doubt.  And that's what the leadership of the church in the United States has been doing for a great long time.  It seems in many cases, unfortunately, that leadership across many denominations, many denominations, has been softening and softening and softening its stances on things that are very clear biblically.  Because it wants to, for whatever reason, you know, put more people in the seats, more money in the coffers, whatever the case may be.  I'm going to tell you something, guys.  Our federal deficit is so bad that I anticipate in the next few years that the 501c3 status is going to, they're going to be eyeing after that one.  They have got to get more money to pay for these unfunded liabilities.  They're broke.  They're so, so broke.  So what happens to the churches when their 501c3 status evaporates?  Like, what are they standing on anymore?  So rather than make this into a diatribe about the failing and sickly status of the church, per se, in the United States, I really want to focus on what this means for Bible believers.  Regardless of what your persuasion is, for those of you who believe in the Word of God and who want to plant your flag on the Word of God and build your house on a firm foundation, we are going to face persecution.  We are facing persecution right now.  What happens if you try and homeschool your children and bring them up in the word to think a certain way?  CPS call.  Send your kids off to public school and have them face the gauntlet of questions about what do mom and daddy teach you at home?  Do you have any guns at home?  Do you have this, that, and the other at home?  Take them to a hospital or some doctor's office where they're asking the magical questions that their alphabet suit medical organizations tell them to.  Do you have any guns at home?  Do you feel safe?  Do mommy and daddy hit you?  But there is persecution right now, and it's not going to get any better, especially when your leadership tucks tail and cowers like what we have seen.  Unfortunately, friends, and perhaps fortunately, I think, and there is a reason why I say fortunately, and I'll get to that.  I think that in the United States, we are going to be facing such an hour where true fellowship amongst believers in scripture is going to face a similar time as the church, persecuted church under communism.  Tortured for Christ by Pastor Warren Brand is a really, really good book to read.  He was persecuted, ironically, under both the Nazis and the Soviet communists.  So I think he would understand, he would understand that it doesn't really matter what flavor of socialism it is.  National socialism, Soviet socialism, doesn't matter.  It all ends up the same place.  Friends, that persecution is coming.  And I spoke about practicalities to consider in my newsletter this past month.  But I'm telling you right now, the times when the apex predators are looking most hungrily at the flock is when its members are limping by.  Or they have a little snivel or they look a little sick.  Doubt is contagious.  Doubt is contagious.  Doubt is essentially a form of fear and moral cowardice.  Pathological doubt.  Not honest intellectual critical analysis.  That's not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about pathological doubt.  Pathological doubt that says my worldview and my thought process is going to be governed by whatever prevailing winds of cocktail hour.  politics are okay for the hour.  versus rooting yourself and rooting your analysis and rooting your thoughts in the word of God, immutable, unchanging, firmly fixed in heavens.  So I would recommend friends that when you see this and we're told about this, we're told about these times it's written.  When you see this, be prepared.  The bitter waters are coming.  Getting together with your friends, your like-minded, friends, people with whom you share a worldview, a common worldview, and mutually pledging yourself to take care of each other and to defend each other, that's a pretty darn good start.  And I talked about this in detail in my Patreon newsletter.  If you'd like more.  There's only so much I can say on YouTube.  It's in some platform.  So I got links in the description box below.  Friends, that's what I wanted to share with you guys today.  It blows on my heart.  Whenever you have leadership that is being swayed by the masses and leadership that is allowing itself to be blown by the prevailing winds and to introduce doubt into its flock and allow people to be swayed by errant ideologies, and by corrupted wickedness, you're building a golden calf.  And the leadership in the United States is so anemic, it's blowing right over and says, okay, golden calf time.  The bitter waters came after the golden calf.  The spirit of the age making whatever god it is you want to serve instead of the one that you know, the one that's written about.  Stay strong, y'all.  I'm not perfect.  I'm not claiming to be perfect.  I'm no saint.  I don't think anybody is.  And if you are, I need to take lessons from you for sure.  But friends, we can hold fast to the word of God.  It is a true, sure, and firm foundation.  Regardless of whatever the cult of personality says, for the leader at the time who falls away and all of his people with him, don't put your hope in men.  Fear of God banishes fear of man.  Put your faith in him.  Put your faith in him.  Be obedient to him and his word.  You won't go wrong.  You won't go wrong.  That's what I have for y'all.  Hope it was helpful for y'all.  If you did enjoy the video, I hope you'll subscribe to me, Patriot Nurse.  You can also support me here on Subscribestar and Patreon as well as cryptocurrency.
