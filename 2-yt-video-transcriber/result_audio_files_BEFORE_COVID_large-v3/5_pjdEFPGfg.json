            "text": "It's taken a long time to get to this point so I really want to do this for the Lord to be baptized today.  I was baptized when I was 13 years old and since then I fell away for a good few years and I fell into all sorts of things like doing Ouija boards.  I became an atheist.  I really hated God.  You know, my upbringing in church turned into a hatred for God when I was in my late teens, early twenties.  And I just fell away so bad and turned to the enemy.  And the Lord really rescued me out of the addiction of alcohol, pornography, sexual deviance.  chasing the things of this world and money and chasing after the enemy spiritually.  I just really want to get baptized again because not that I have to as a work because Jesus has justified me but in full obedience of his command that we do get baptized with water.  Today I want to get baptized with water in the Sea of Galilee.  So that's where I am today on the Sea of Galilee where Jesus walked on water.  It's just an amazing beautiful place.  I'm here with my brother in Christ.  And so with this today I am declaring publicly that my faith, to all my friends and family and people across the world who have watched these videos, I'm declaring publicly that my faith is in Jesus Christ.  His death and resurrection is my identity.  I die with him and I'm raised with him.  I'm dead to this world, dead to my past, dead to the sin, dead to the enemy's kingdom, and I'm now born again, but showing that through the act of baptism as a symbol today, both for this world and for the spiritual world.  I renounce everything that I was part of, and it's just a joy to be here today to do that publicly.  so friends and family my faith is in jesus christ and i hope that through this witness you will see his power.  um you know his glory.  yeah my hope is in heaven brother.
