            "text": "Hey everybody, I have a video to share with you.  This was not a planned video.  It's a spontaneous video.  I believe I'm supposed to do this, so I'm doing it.  I would suggest that after hearing this video, if you think that it's per chance speaking to you, that you might watch it a couple times through and pray about it.  This is kind of harsh, but I feel I'm supposed to share it, so I am.  And I'm not sure at this point whether I will disable comments in the comments section or not.  Obviously, you're free to find out if you can leave a comment.  I haven't made my mind up yet.  It may be, it may be not disabled.  I don't know.  You guys just have to check it and find out.  But I'm going to go ahead and read this.  And again, I would ask you if you think you're being talked to that you pray about this.  Okay.  All right.  First of all, it says what I was praying and, you know, I heard in my head just plain as day, write this message to my people.  I know that sounds kind of a little old King James Bible-y kind of thought, but it's what I had go through my head.  So this is what it says, all right?  Write this message to my people.  I am stepping through the door.  I am coming soon for my bride.  Yet first there must be a shaking.  For some of you are not of my sheep.  You are pretending to be part of my body, yet you are not, so I will expose you, and you will be naked and full of shame.  You are deceiving my children with your false witness, and I will bring shame upon you until you repent and turn to me.  You want others to believe that you know me, yet you do not.  My bride is holy, and you are a blemish, so I will shake my house.  You will not be able to stand and you will be exposed.  I tell you, turn and repent.  Joel 2, that's Joel chapter 2, is my message to you.  My word was given to lead you, to teach you my ways, and to reprove you of your sin.  Turn now.  Again, I say, turn now.  Okay, that's it.  Write this message to my people.  So I gave it.  That's all I can do.  We'll talk to you guys again soon.  Take care.  Bye. ",
