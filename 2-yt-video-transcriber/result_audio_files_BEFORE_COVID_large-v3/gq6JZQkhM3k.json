            "text": "hey everybody I have a quick video for you.  I don't do much in the way of news but I do occasionally post some news articles or something that's newsworthy that I want you guys to know about.  okay I thought this one was pretty important.  I'm not really sure at this point what can be done about it if anything but certainly prayer.  okay um i'm going to go ahead and read this article now.  this was in the.  our local abc affiliate station out of wichita posted this but i also received it last night from ed.  he sent me a video linking to this as well and i don't know who the guy was in the video.  i've never heard of him before.  actually his name escapes you right now.  i don't remember what his name was But I'm going to hopefully come back to a comment that he made that I want to share with you.  But I'm going to go ahead and read this, okay?  So please listen up.  This is, like, major.  Okay.  Federal ruling allows women to legally go topless in six states, including Kansas.  Women in six states, including Kansas, are now effectively allowed to be topless in public, according to a new ruling by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.  According to the Washington Times, they report, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a topless ban in Fort Collins, Colorado.  The court's decision makes it legal for women to go topless in states that fall under the Tenth Circuit Court.  excuse me those states are wyoming utah colorado kansas new mexico and um oklahoma.  okay and uh basically it was a four to three vote and the city of uh fort collins decided not to go to the supreme court over it because they thought it was a waste of money.  Excuse me for the cough.  I've been sick.  I still am.  I'm trying to get over this.  I have a chest cold.  Okay, so what it says is that in the article, it says that girls as young as 11 years old from 11 years old up can go topless in those six states that are mentioned and they've done it under gender equality and that the girls have a right.  if the guys don't have to wear their shirts then the girls don't have to wear theirs and the federal court appeals court upheld it and says that that's that's right.  so now if your daughter and you live in one of these six states, decides she wants to go topless, technically there's nothing you can do about it.  Now, I know that you guys are on the other side of this camera saying, oh, by beep, beep, beep, I will do something about it.  Well, I understand that.  I would too.  But as far as the law is concerned, Due to gender equality, they are legally allowed to go topless now in these six states.  And, you know, my first thought is, you know, nobody's going to do that.  And that's a wrong thought.  I guarantee you people are going to do that.  There's going to be feminists out there all over that are going to gladly jump on that bandwagon and do that.  You know, you think that it wouldn't happen, but I'll tell you what, I've seen everything, including topless, in Southern California.  It'll happen, okay?  No, people don't walk around topless in Southern California, but you have to see some of the parades that they've put on where they have done that or go down to the beaches where they have done that.  So I wanted to make you aware of that.  Extremely... Our country is truly, truly going downhill on a bobsled.  This is very upsetting.  that this guy and his wife would even go to court over her wanting to be topless in the Fort Collins area.  Now, with that said, again, this is from Cake, K-A-K-E News out of Wichita.  It's an ABC News affiliate in Wichita.  And the rest of the article was written by the Washington Times.  Look it up.  I'm not putting links.  Now, with that said, I've told you guys before, that the Lord spoke to me and told me that America was going to be judged.  Now, I had placed a video six, eight months ago called Important Message, I believe it was.  And in that, I made some comments.  It was about a word the Lord gave me about America.  I'm not going to read the whole thing again, but I am going to read the last three lines.  It's really equivalent of one paragraph, the ending half of that.  I want to read to you.  But before I do, I also want to make a comment.  In the very last line in this, it says, \"...one hour, one hour, and destruction  comes.\".  Secure yourself in me.  Cling to me.  I will protect you.  Though you will be shaken, I have you in the palm of my hand.  Rest there.  All right, that one hour and destruction comes.  As I told you in the original video when I posted this, that I did not believe that meant an hour from now, you know, God's going to wipe out America.  What I believe it means is in with a one-hour block, within a one-hour time period, When God judges, within one hour, America's toast.  Totally wiped out.  I'm saying, I also want to say that the gentleman that Ed tagged me in his video, I don't remember what his name was.  He starts the video with prayer, and then he goes into some things the Lord told him.  And the first thing he says is that the Lord told him in one hour, America would be destroyed.  Okay, now, the only reason my ears perked up is because he said in one hour, okay?  And that's what the Lord told me.  And I thought that was, for me, that was almost like a confirmation.  that was interesting that this guy would say that.  I don't know who the guy is.  I don't know if he's legit, if he's, you know, what he is.  I have no idea.  I don't know who the person is.  I don't even remember his name.  But that's what he had said.  I wanted to reread just the last paragraph to you guys of what the Lord told me, whatever it was, six, eight months ago.  This is just the last half.  If you want to read the whole thing, go to a video that I have in the archives called Important Message.  All right, this is just the last paragraph.  Destruction of America will be swift and leave many reeling in disbelief.  of the unseen attack by an enemy not known to be capable of destroying a nation such as America.  This will blindside you.  Only I could bring this attack.  God speaking.  America will know that the hand of a holy God that they rejected from their country has swiftly brought them to ruin.  One hour, one hour of destruction comes.  Secure yourself in me.  Cling to me.  I will protect you.  Though you will be shaken, I have you in the palm of my hand.  Rest there.  What stands out to me, yeah, the one hour, because that guy said that, that made my ears perk up, but America will know that the hand of a holy God that they rejected from their country.  You know, I've said that several times over.  There was a second word that the Lord had given me that I put, I think it was an important message too.  If I remember right, it said something to the effect of America won't turn from her sins.  Okay, we're seeing that.  We are clearly seeing that with everything that's going on.  are definitely seeing that.  and now to have the news say and our stupid federal appeals court uphold that women can go around topless if they want to in six state six states and you know if those if that starts to take place in those six states that are mentioned including my state of kansas Shut up.  My state of Kansas.  You know, there's other states that are super liberal that are going to jump on that bandwagon.  Guaranteed.  It'll happen.  And it'll be more than six states.  Folks, we need to pray for our country.  I say it.  I say it.  I say it over and over and over again.  We have to pray for our country.  All right.  Please do that.  Quit thinking that, oh, God's going to wipe us out anyway, so it doesn't matter.  We're in the end times.  All this is spoken of in the Bible.  When God judged countries and peoples in the Bible, there were several times when he judged them, and that judgment didn't come for hundreds of years.  He said, I'm going to do it, but he didn't do it for generations.  Listen, God is merciful.  He will judge America.  As he told me, as he apparently told this other guy, whoever he is, he's going to judge America.  But your prayers, your prayers and my prayers could possibly stay his hand of judgment till a later date if we would turn away from our sins and repent.  Okay, turn back to him.  It's what scripture says.  Read Chronicles.  It's very clear.  So I just want to share that with you guys.  Sorry this isn't an upbeat video.  My attitude's kind of, I don't know what it is.  I'm so surprised of hearing this news.  It just bums me out big time.  And on top of being sick, I'm just not really in the mood for a video, but I wanted you guys to know what's going on.  So anyway, you guys can vet that story if you want to.  You can find out that it's legit.  That's it.  Any comments, please leave them in the comment section.  Thumbs up if you like it, thumbs down if you don't.  Please do comment.  If you like the video, please share it.  Let other people know about it.  YouTube is doing their best to take my channel downhill.  I've been over 13,000.  I know in my mind, just you know that you know.  I know my channel is over 14,000 people now because it's been many, many, many months.  And I get subs on a regular basis.  I've got subs right now waiting, a video full of subs to welcome to my channel that I haven't even posted yet.  So my point to all of that is when you guys thumbs up or even thumbs down or make a comment and share the video, those kind of things, with the way the algorithms go in YouTube, it allows my channel to be in the recommended section.  I don't want my channel to fall out of there.  Please, if you like the video, thumbs up and share it.  I'd really appreciate it.  God bless you guys.  I hope you have a really good week coming up ahead.  I will have another video out when I feel a little bit better.  I'll get something put out.  I have a couple things I wanted to talk to you guys about.  So that's it for today, though.  Pray for our nation, and we'll talk to you again soon.  Stay safe.  Stay alert. ",
