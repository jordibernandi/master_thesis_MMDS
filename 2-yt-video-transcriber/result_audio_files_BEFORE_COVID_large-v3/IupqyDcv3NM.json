            "text": "Some of you in this room today are going through the greatest trial of your life.  It may be a physical one, where the doctors have looked at you and said you don't stand a chance of beating this.  Some of you may be going through a financial crisis.  Others of you may be going through an emotional crisis, where your heart has been shattered into a million pieces.  and you genuinely believe that you will never smile again.  It may also look like you will never stop crying.  Some of you have been through failure after failure, and every time it seems like you take one step forward, you then take three steps back.  Regardless of your situation, regardless of how calamitous your current circumstances may be.  This one verse is a beaming light of hope.  through whatever storm it is you may be walking through.  Nahum 1.7 The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble.  He cares for those who trust in him.  No matter how broken your heart is, no matter how dark and dismal your situation may be, the Lord is good and is a stronghold in the day of trouble.  This one verse is a guarantee from God that regardless of whatever the devil throws at you, the Lord is good.  Are you in trouble?  Have you been broken by a bitter divorce?  Have you been broken by failure?  Have you been broken by rejection?  Have you been broken by what someone else did to you?  The Lord is your stronghold in your day of trouble.  The situation may look bad right now, but the Lord your God is good.  It may seem like defeat is the only outcome, but the Lord your God is good.  Our blessed hope is the Lord of all situations.  He is the way maker.  He can remove the barriers.  He can heal broken marriages.  He can open doors that are closed.  He can bring the answer that you cannot answer.  Nahum 1.7, the Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble.  He cares for those who trust in him.  You know from your own experiences that the Lord is good.  God cares about you.  Do you believe that?  There are so many children of God who live their whole life without ever grasping this one truth.  that God loves and cares about them individually.  This infinite God who created the heaven and earth cares about you.  You need to be rooted and grounded in the fact that God loves and cares for you.  And the wonderful thing about God is that he didn't wait until you got your life together to be good to you.  He didn't wait until you sang your first worship song to love you.  But God demonstrated his goodness and his love toward us in Romans 5a.  But God proves his love for us in this.  While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  I need to emphasize this point.  God does not wait until you have your life together to love you.  God loved you before the foundations of the earth.  Before you made your first mistake, he loved you.  God loved you when you didn't even know his name.  He loved you before you were baptized.  The Lord is good.  and is watching every detail in your life.  Look what he said in Jeremiah.  For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, to give you a future and a hope.  What you and I both know is that life is full of things that we don't want or like to happen to us.  Disappointments, frustrations, betrayal, heartbreak, all these are things that at one point in our lives we will experience.  But God will not allow a difficulty to happen unless he is going to somehow use it to our benefit.  Every closed door Every delay will work to your advantage.  His plans are to prosper you and not to harm you.  To give you a future and a hope.  God has a plan for your future.  The problem with us, children of God, is when we are going through a difficult situation, we focus on the problem and how big it is.  or we focus on how far we have fallen into the ditch.  Think that there is no way we can get out of this troublesome situation.  Your God, your Heavenly Father, is a stronghold in a day of trouble.  The Lord is good.  He will step into your crisis with you.  The Lord is good.  He will heal your broken heart.  The Lord is good.  He will make you the head and not the tail.  The Lord is good.  He will strengthen you when you have no more strength.  The Lord is good.  He will fight your battles.  The Lord is good.  He will protect your children.  The Lord is good.  He will heal your marriage.  The thing is, we are only getting a glimpse of how good God is.  Because if God showed us all of his goodness at one time, our human brains would not be able to comprehend the magnitude of his virtue and integrity.  The Lord, our God, is good.  And he will never change.  James 1.17 says, Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.  God cannot be anything but good.  It is in his nature.  His goodness is a part of his very essence.  We can do good things and have good qualities, but we can never be good.  It is an attribute reserved for and only for God.  Even Jesus said in Luke 18, verse 19, Why do you call me good?  Jesus answered.  No one is good except God alone.  Everything God does is for our good.  And that is why he provided your salvation through his only son.  And that is why we must give thanks.  as Psalms 107 says, give thanks to the Lord for he is good.  His love endures forever.  Brothers and sisters, I want you to take this passage of scripture for the rest of your life.  And remember that whatever situation you are going through, God loves you.  Ephesians 3, so that you may be fully able with all saints to comprehend what is the breadth and the length and the height and depth and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.  Now to him who is able to do infinitely more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us. ",

            "text": "I don't know what you may be going through today.  It could be that you have that feeling that God isn't hearing you when you pray.  Or it may be that you even feel worse than that, that God doesn't care.  That God isn't concerned.  But I can assure you from the word of God that he does care and he is concerned.  And he tells you to just cast all your cares on him because he does care for you.  And so I would encourage you to look up.  Quit looking at the problem.  Quit looking at the circumstances.  Quit being overwhelmed by your weakness and ineptness to take care of the situation and look to God who has promised to take care of you and to provide all of your needs.  But I don't see where... You don't have to.  He has resources you don't know anything about.  And I pray that God will give you the faith of Habakkuk.  The faith that can rejoice, spin around, jump up and down in the fact that I'm God's child.  He promised to take care of me and I know he will.  The encouragement to just trust in the Lord with all of your heart.  Don't lean to your own understanding.  Just in all your ways acknowledge him.  He'll take care of you.  He'll direct your path.  He'll provide for your needs.  He loves you.  He's watching over you.  And he will never fail.  May the Lord be with you.  May he reveal his love and his closeness to you this week.  May you be encouraged and strengthened as you keep your eyes upon him and may your faith be built up in Jesus' name. ",
