            "text": "You know, I used to be under the impression that I lived in a country that was united.  But it doesn't feel too united.  Is it just federal governance, the Constitution that unites us?  Because there are borders within borders here.  Many.  Here in the  U.S.,  we all live under one Constitution, but for some strange reason, the same rules do not apply everywhere in the country.  now, do they?  States have their own laws that vary from state to state and I believe that's fair.  but I can't help but to think also how strange that is being called the United States when we can't even agree to the same set of rules across the board.  We are the somewhat United States of America and for good reason because without that division of states from the federal government this place would be a total mess.  Now fortunately We can roam freely within the US to certain states where certain things are legal, where in other states they are not.  Doesn't seem very fair, but hey, that's the way things have always been here.  It is quite a large place to govern, and so states, counties, cities have their own assortment of regulations or laws.  The point is this.  It is a gigantic country and many of you know how culturally shocking it can be just by traveling a few hundred miles a couple of states away.  And you may also know that when traveling the rules of the streets tend to change too.  You really have to adapt to a new security situation as you are outside of your element or home and are essentially in the wild whether you are in a city or forest because you can get hurt just as easily in both.  But understand this, out there in the wilderness, doesn't matter if you've been there before, doesn't matter if you know the land, the wilderness will always be the wilderness.  Wild things can happen at any time.  That's why they call it that.  And I really think that many people who live in the U.S.  don't really understand how large this place is and how large it is to get lost in and never seen again.  And that is one of the reasons I want to revisit and discuss the missing 411 and what is happening with missing persons in our national forest, which to some may be of no surprise.  After all, it's where the wild things are.  Back in the day when I was training to become a private investigator, I had to decide what area of investigations I would want to get into.  Many people go the security law enforcement route.  They work with lawyers, police officers, many get into performing background checks.  Some get into investigating marital affairs, you know, the cheating spouse.  Some but few get into bounty hunting.  And me, I wanted to lean more into investigating missing persons.  But what I am talking about is tracking down misplaced loved ones or old friends.  You know, people that have been out of touch so long that they just want information on how to get in touch with that person again.  Or maybe because they just want to reunite with them.  Maybe it's an adopted person looking for their biological parents.  Cases like that.  But investigating people who just disappear and go missing from everyone, that is next level and takes a lot of field experience to perform effectively.  There are people who run searches for a living.  Now, David Politis is a former police detective and author of the Missing 411 series, with eight books and 1,200 cases under his belt.  Now I've covered this topic before, more focusing on the disappearance of children in national parks.  And I've always believed that if you are out in the wilderness voluntarily, then if you are able to, then I would definitely bring a rifle.  And a handgun.  And a knife.  And a taser.  also maybe one of those little keychains of mace.  The point is, you want to feel safe and confident that you can protect yourself out of the unknown, right?  But apparently, in some of these national parks, it doesn't matter if you're armed or not.  I recently viewed the latest Missing 411 documentary, The Hunted, and this is what I want to discuss.  And I recommend that you all go and take a look at this film.  Now, I don't want to spoil what's in the film, but I do want to use the first case discussed in the film as an example of what we are talking about here.  And that is the case of Thomas Messick of Horicon, New York, who went missing a few years ago at Brant Lake.  He was 82 years of age and armed.  So without spoiling the film too much, basically what happened was Tom went up with six friends to an area east of the lake for hunting.  They left their vehicles parked in one place and then went down by the lake to set up their watch post.  Now after some time, they regrouped where they parked their vehicles, but Tom did not come back.  Ever.  Nothing was found, no body, no clothing, and he had a walkie-talkie, a rifle, and a few other items.  Nothing was found, not even a scent from a canine, nothing.  Now, one of the things that I like about this film is that it gives you the common denominating factors in these types of cases, and they are listed for you in the film, which he calls profile points.  And these are a list of things that are almost always a common phenomenon in cases like Tom's.  You know, people tend to go out in the wilderness with others.  It's of course at the point when they get separated from the group that they go missing.  Also, another point in cases like these, when they go missing, it's usually near a body of water and it is usually accompanied by some weather event, such as a snowstorm.  There are more on this list, but the profile points that stand out the most to me is one, the fact that canines can't pick up a scent.  And that right there, my friends, tells me the reason the dogs can't pick up a scent is because there is nothing to give off the scent.  In other words, the source of the scent has been removed completely, sometimes only temporarily and sometimes indefinitely.  And what makes that even more creepy is the freak weather or storms that follow the disappearance.  as if someone or something were trying to cover their tracks.  In this film, you will get a pretty good look into this phenomenon, and the whole thing tends to hint at something.  It hints that maybe, maybe, some creature or thing may be taking these people, and sometimes they are putting them back after the search party is not around.  And by the end of this film, you will be blown away as to what type of creature may be out there.  And I'm not talking about Bigfoot.  So let's talk about this for a moment.  Now, according to the National Park Foundation, there are 61 park sites in the nation covering an area of more than 84 million acres in each state.  Now, I'll tell you, based on the location of these missing 411 cases, the hot spots, It looks like if you just hang out somewhere in the middle of the  U.S.,  you're good.  And do you know why there haven't really been any missing 411 cases out there?  Because there really aren't any national parks out there.  Like three in North and South Dakota.  I mean, what's the difference where people go missing?  Are the national parks designated disappearing areas?  It seems the central region of the US is off limits.  Are you not allowed to disappear without a trace in Nebraska?  What makes them so special?  Is the population there too low to feed off of?  Because I mean, if you disappear without a trace, I'm sorry, but something ate you.  And that something doesn't like the taste of Nebraskans.  I'm just being a bit facetious here, everyone, now.  This would be the main profile point.  You being in a national park and around a bunch of rocks and being near some water like a lake, river, or creek.  You know what?  Let me tell you a story that is not in this film.  It's just another example of what are typical occurrences in these cases.  And that is the story of Bobby Bizup.  It was the summer of 1958 when 10-year-old Bobby Bisup, along with a few other young children, were attending a Catholic camping retreat called Camp St.  Malo at the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.  Now, Bobby was an introvert and his hearing was also impaired.  So, on August 15th, Bobby decided that he would do some fishing down by Cabin Creek, which was known to be the hot spot for the boys to go fish while on retreat.  And, of course, all the adults at the camp would be close by.  The creek is right next to the camp, just outside St.  Catherine's Chapel.  The boys fished there all the time.  In fact, there was an adult with the boys when they fished.  No worries, right?  Once dinner time came around, one of the counselors had Bobby head back with him to meet up with the others for dinner.  Now as Bobby was following closely behind the counselor, the counselor looked back to find that Bobby was gone.  It is at this point where the counselor of course is assuming that Bobby is just toying with him and hiding.  But after looking around the area and calling out for the boy with no sign of him, The counselor had to go and alert the others.  After the alert, the other counselors began to look for Bobby, but could not find him.  So they alerted the authorities and for nine days, volunteers, pilots from Denver's Lowry Air Force Base and around 400 police officers with tracking dogs searched for Bobby and ended up finding absolutely nothing.  And what's crazy is that if someone called me up and said that this happened with my child, I don't know if I would believe them.  In fact, I would probably think that someone at that camp did something with my child.  There is no way you could just lose a kid that way, especially since the search began immediately after losing sight of the boy.  I would honestly think that these camp counselors let my child get kidnapped by some backwoods nut.  There is no way you would convince me of him wandering off and getting lost.  Not with that story.  I'd go right to the counselor that saw him last, and I would not leave that guy alone until my kid was found.  Am I wrong?  You better call Tommy Lee Jones or something.  You're finding my kid.  By the way, let me point out to you all that In many, many of these cases, the victim is often disabled or has some type of ailment or impairment.  One of the things that was very interesting was the fact that at that time, there was a doctor who was on vacation, and he claims that he sighted Bobby up by a hardware store in Estes Park, which is about 15 miles up the road from the camp.  Crazy, right?  Well... That's what they thought the doctor was, crazy.  They could not find Bobby or any traces of him, no clothing, nothing.  Months went by, almost a year went by, and then something was found.  Three miles away and 2,500 feet up, Mount Meeker, just in some random ravine that they had previously searched several times.  They found a broken hearing aid, some torn clothing, and unfortunately some bone fragments that were confirmed to be what remained of Bobby.  They could not figure out what happened to him and how his remains ended up so high up in the mountain.  A place that was not easily accessible, by the way.  I think as a parent I would be hunting down the perpetrator to this very day, alien or not.  And don't tell me it was probably an animal, because then I'd go on a hunting spree to take out anything moving.  Folks, watch your kids.  Stop sending them away to these stupid camps when you should be with them.  But you know, these incidences don't always end up in death.  There is a case David Polites and Lestrade of Survivorman discussed.  And that is the case of two-year-old Keith Parkins.  Now, this was in 1952 in Ritter, Oregon.  And this happened at the boy's home.  It was midwinter, so there was plenty of snow cover.  Keith was outside playing.  He had a jacket on, but of course, nothing that would keep him warm enough overnight.  And because he was not being watched by his family at two years old, he vanished.  They went looking for him and followed his little footprints up to the point where they just stopped.  They didn't find any human footprints or animals nearby.  Fortunately for Keith's family, he was found.  Nineteen hours later... 15 miles away on top of a frozen pond laying face down in the snow with no jacket mind you and He was alive.  They questioned the two-year-old about what happened and of course Keith could remember nothing.  They never did find out what happened and even if Keith did remember at the age of two I don't think many adults would believe his account.  So, I mean, I don't know what you want me to say, folks.  There's a monster out there in national parks kidnapping and eating people.  That's about the gist of it.  I mean, it's not complicated.  That's what it looks like to me.  These people are being taken and they are being murdered or returned left for dead.  And whatever is taking them seems to be playing games with whoever is looking for them.  That's what it looks like to me.  Now, I do want to say something about Bigfoot.  If you did not know, even though this is a mythical creature, there are old stories about how the Sasquatch fathers would kidnap young human males so that they could breed them with their Sasquatch daughters.  Bigfoot is a very stalky, stealthy creature, and it is also a myth that they like to kidnap women.  And when you look deep into the reports of sightings, when there are actual Bigfoot sightings, they are usually there, not really for the women, but to take men.  Did you know this?  We simply don't know about everything that is out there in that wilderness.  We just don't.  And we shouldn't pretend that we do.  When it comes to these cases, it's always a bunch of maybes.  Well, maybe it was aliens.  Maybe it's part of a secret government kidnapping program.  Maybe they're getting sucked underground and spit back up, sometimes in pieces.  Maybe it's Bigfoot.  I don't know.  We still don't have an answer for what is happening to people.  What do you think it is?  Either way, it does feel like there is something out there.  Lurking.  Stalking.  waiting for the opportune time to act.  If there is one thing that I can say that I'm pretty certain about is that in these missing 411 cases, these people certainly didn't go missing all on their own.  Thank you. ",
