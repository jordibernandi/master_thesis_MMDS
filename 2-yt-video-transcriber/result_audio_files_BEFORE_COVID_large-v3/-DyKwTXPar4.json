            "text": "Hey, it's K, and this is Skittles, master of all four elements.  And these boys right here?  Well, this is Brian Big Boy Konietzko and Michael Tortellini DiMartino, the creators of Avatar.  Following the success of The Last Airbender, Brian and Michael set out to create a more mature follow-up series that would introduce nuanced political themes.  The only problem is, Mike and Brian don't understand political ideologies.  Book three and four are what I think of as the better half of The Legend of Korra.  They were produced simultaneously, and book three confidently sets up characters and ideas that don't really pay off until book four.  Thank you, Captain.  You can call me Kuvira.  But by the time book two wrapped up, the boys announced that they would be doing two more seasons and knew exactly when and how it would end.  Which can only benefit the writing process, so let's see if this allowed them to develop the political ideas in their work a little further than they'd been able to do previously.  This time around, the boys revisit some of the ideas they touched on in Book 1, questions of authority, of hierarchy.  Are these things justified?  What actions are justified in response to finding yourself at the bottom of a hierarchy?  But their approach is different this time.  The antagonists of Book 3, the Red Lotus, set themselves apart from the other enemies Korra faces throughout the series in two key ways.  The first is that they are completely transparent about their ideology.  They explicitly state they are anarchists multiple times, while Amon, Unalaq, and Kavira in season 4 require a little bit of exploration to understand what kind of ideological gears are turning in their heads.  The second distinctive quality the Red Lotus has is they mean it.  Anarchy is not a convenient cloak for a quest to gain power.  These guys genuinely hold these beliefs.  sihir even in defeat is still espousing his ideals.  he never cared about taking power for himself.  he genuinely thinks the world would be a better place for everyone if his plan to end all nations and governments were to succeed.  The boys, however, don't agree.  In previous seasons, their go-to tactic to, uh, prove why someone's ideas are wrong is to have them not genuinely believe in the things they say.  To be using communism or environmentalism or what have you to give an air of legitimacy for their personal petty vengeance or hunger for power.  When the boys don't do that, when they write an antagonist with actual integrity who believes the things they say, their only other option if they require that antagonist to be wrong is simple.  Their ideas need to be DONE AS SHIT.  Exactly.  The natural order is disorder.  You don't understand.  The revolution has already begun.  Chaos is the natural order of all-.  If you think Henry Rollins here sounds like a 14 year old boy who just discovered Black Flag and thinks this anarchy thing is pretty cool, whatever it is, well it's because he does.  But before we dive into that, we should understand the status quo that these anarchists are fighting against in the first place.  When the gang arrive in Ba Sing Se, they see a city divided by a rigid class system.  Literally, there's giant stone walls segregating the city into the outer, middle, and inner ring.  The inner ring is a beautiful landscape of palaces and gardens while the outer ring is a deeply impoverished slum where massive families cram into small, poor quality homes and fruit stands sell rotting produce.  This is meant to be shocking and a contributory factor to the evilness of the Earth Queen, who is written to be deeply unsympathetic.  Is there an animal in my presence?  But does Republic City not have an underground shanty town full of homeless people?  When the gang discovers it in season one, it's made out to be almost idyllic.  The one resident we meet is cartoonishly happy-go-lucky and even expounds how tolerant and equal everyone is down here.  What is bad under monarchy becomes good under liberal democracy and capitalism.  or at the very least it becomes an acceptable price to pay.  Or how about when the Queen drafts the airbenders into her army, something clearly depicted as terrible, as tantamount to kidnapping, as if the real world parallel of the United Republic has never had a draft before?  From the perspective of the boys, we've agreed the absolute rule of monarchs is unacceptable.  Good.  But this means they're able to criticize monarchy in a way that they seem to suddenly become blind to the moment the object of said criticism becomes a system more akin to the one they live in.  It's a blind spot.  you notice a lot throughout the series, as we've touched on before.  And we only know about the underground shanty town beneath Republic City or the impoverished slums in the outer ring of Ba Sing Se because our protagonists visit them.  But the way they interact with these places is very telling.  They rarely have much to say about the incredible poverty around them and they certainly don't discuss these economic circumstances or the system that designed them with the people who live in these places.  they're more than happy to forget about them and hang out in mansions and palaces afterward.  but you know who we never see in the shanty town or the outer ring.  you know who we never once see having a conversation with a normal person with a worker or a peasant or an otherwise oppressed member of society The red fucking lotus.  Zaheer's entire plan to liberate the people and bring about a non-authoritarian anarchist society is to never interact with the people.  To turn up and assassinate the queen, president, whoever, and then announce over the radio, there you go, fucking figure it out my dudes, and then just leave.  throughout history kings and queens were assassinated or otherwise died unexpectedly.  all the time.  you know what generally happened.  their successor would take the throne and carry on as normal.  so what was the point of killing the earth queen?  Do the boys think that an individual leader is the system?  Is the government?  A mindset that might have you thinking.  all the terrible things that have happened under, say, the Trump administration, are unique to Donald Trump, with no thought to a system and a culture that permitted these things to begin with, that created the conditions in which he won the election, trapping you in the mentality that if we can just beat the bad man, everything will be good again.  At first, I thought they simply wanted to depict Zaheer as thinking that way, to show that he doesn't understand how power can be systemic, rather than held by individuals alone.  But the second he announces the Queen is dead, the people begin to riot, loot and burn their city.  Apparently, all the superpowered guards disappear with the Queen.  Apparently, the people suddenly stop fearing for their safety and family and begin doing all sorts of dangerous, violent shit.  the second the leader dies.  Why?  Do the boys think this happened whenever a monarch died?  Most people likely didn't even think that much about it.  Like, when a new president is elected, it just means a new monarch will be crowned shortly.  Nothing changes.  And what a high opinion of the people the boys seem to have.  As soon as the status quo is disrupted, they immediately set fire to their own homes.  This is presented as exactly what Zaheer expected to happen.  With all his weird poetry about chaos being the natural order, we can assume that this is in no way a surprise to him.  But here's the problem.  That's Not what anarchists think.  Anarchists don't think the concept of chaos will magically fix society's problems or is some natural order that we must return to.  I don't think anyone believes that.  That's not a real political position that anyone has.  The boys have crafted a perfectly ridiculous straw man that communicates a clear message.  The people questioning the status quo, challenging the hierarchies that exist in our society, don't have a real plan and haven't thought this through.  Anarchists believe that capitalism and private property not only inhibit the freedom of the vast majority of people, but cause them needless social and economic hardship.  And this system is enforced by the state, which must be done away with, or radically transformed, to accommodate a more equitable society.  And that doesn't mean everyone gets paid the same and shares a toothbrush, it means people have common ownership of the means of production, of property.  Anarchy is at its core about democratic control of the things we need to keep society running, which are currently in the hands of a wealthy ruling class who is able to dictate their will unto us in a distinctly top-down way, in a hierarchy.  In order to achieve this kind of world, you would need to elevate the class consciousness of the people dramatically.  People are not used to having this kind of control over society, over their own destiny.  We are still trapped in a mindset of looking to leaders for guidance in a way that makes many of us averse to this kind of system, and that's not a personal shortcoming, it's the result of the environment that we live in.  We have very little control over that environment.  Even if we're sold an idea of independence, it's entirely superficial.  So many of us are trapped in jobs where even our bathroom breaks are controlled.  We're conditioned to not have autonomy.  This means education and organizing with other working class people, or peasants in this case, has to be at the forefront of any anarchist's plan to transform society, and indeed any mass movement that wants to succeed.  But Zaheer and the Red Lotus don't do that.  They don't educate people, they don't build solidarity and confidence in these oppressed communities.  They turn up from out of town and off their leader.  Their so-called revolution has no involvement from the people, we don't even know to what degree people disagree with the status quo, because nobody ever asks them.  These anarchists who claim to be liberating the people without ever engaging with them are delivering a distinctly top-down revolution.  There was never any way this could go other than a new ruler coming in to take the throne because they built nothing.  They planned nothing.  People had no idea what to do when the system was suddenly pulled out from under them because they didn't even know it was happening.  Pick any country in the world.  Do you think if you went and eliminated whoever was in charge and sent out a message to all the people to just do anarchy now that they would do it?  Or would they regard you as some weirdo terrorist and ignore you?  There is no revolution without the people.  You cannot build a world where things are collectively owned and operated without collective action.  Anyone who knew even the first thing about what anarchists actually want and believe could tell you that.  But the boys decided.  the vague and inaccurate notion of anarchist politics that I have to imagine they got from watching Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight would suffice.  Exactly.  The natural order is disorder.  Introduce a little.  Anarchy.  Chaos is a natural order!  The boys are so deep in the ideological framework of capitalism. ",
