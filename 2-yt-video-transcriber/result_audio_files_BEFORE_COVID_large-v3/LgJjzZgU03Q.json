            "text": "Good morning or afternoon, actually.  My name is Matt Schwab.  I'm from New York, Pound Ridge, New York.  I actually had a question about the silver purchase last year.  When you announced it, you said that you believe that supply and demand fundamentals would only be established at a higher price, reestablished at a higher price.  I was just wondering if you could go into more detail about what some of those fundamentals are.  I mean, we've read a lot about like battery technology and some other things. ",

            "text": "Yeah, we have no inside information about great new uses for silver or anything of the sort.  But the situation \u2014 and you can get these figures, and they're not precise, but I think they're generally accurate.  You can see from looking at the numbers that aggregate demand, primarily from photography from industrial uses and from ornamental jewelry type uses.  It's close, call it 800 million plus ounces a year.  And there are 500 million or so ounces being produced of silver annually, although there will be more coming on in the next couple of years.  There's more coming on right now.  However, most of that silver is produced as a byproduct in the mining of gold or copper, lead, zinc, so that since it's a byproduct, it's not very responsive to price changes, because obviously if you've got a copper mine and you get a little silver out of it, you're much more interested in the price of copper than silver.  So you have 500 million ounces or so of mine production, and you have 150 million ounces or so of reclaimed silver, a large part of which relates to the uses in photography.  So there has been a gap in recent years of perhaps 150 million ounces, but none of these figures are precise, which has been filled by an inventory of bullion above ground, which may have been a billion two or more ounces a few years back, but which has been depleted.  And no one knows the exact figures on this, but there's no question that the bullion inventory has been depleted significantly, which means that the present price for silver does not produce an equilibrium between supply as measured by newly mined silver plus reclaimed silver and usage.  And that eventually something will happen to change that picture.  Now, it could be reduced usage, it could be increased supply, or it could be a change in price.  And that imbalance is sufficiently large even though there is some new production coming on and there is the threat of digital imaging that will reduce silver usage perhaps in the future in photography.  but we think that that gap has is wide enough so that it will continue to deplete inventories bullion inventories to the point where a new price is needed to establish equilibrium.  and because of the byproduct nature which makes the supply inelastic, and because the nature of demand, which is relatively inelastic, that we don't think that that price change would necessarily be minor.  It's interesting because silver has been artificially influenced for a long time.  You saw that movie about, you know, it was William Jennings Bryan, who was editor of the Omaha World Herald and a congressman from Nebraska, and whose brother was governor of Nebraska, who was the big silver man, and they used to talk 16 to 1.  The 16 to 1 ratio, I think, goes back to Isaac Newton when he was master of the mint.  Charlie will know all about that because he's our Newtonian expert here.  But that ratio had kind of mystical significance for a while.  It didn't really mean anything.  And in 1934, the government passed an act called the Silver Purchase Act of surprisingly, 1934, which set an artificially high price for silver at that time, when production and usage was much less.  And the government \u2014 the U.S.  government ended up accumulating 2 billion ounces of silver.  Now, this was at a time when demand was a couple hundred million ounces a year, so you're talking 10 years' supply.  So there was an artificially high price for a while.  By the 19 \u2014 early 1960s, that became an artificially low price of $1.29.  And at that time, I could see the inventories of the US government being depleted, somewhat akin to what inventories are being depleted now.  And despite the fact that Lyndon Johnson and the administration said they would not demonetize silver, they did demonetize it, and silver went up substantially.  That was the last purchase we had of silver, but I've kept track of the figures ever since.  The Hunt brothers caused a great amount of silver to be converted into bullion form, including a lot of silver coins.  So they, again, increased the supply in a very big way by their action in pushing the price way up to the point where people started melding it down.  So you had these dislocations in silver over a 60-plus year period, which has caused the price to be affected by these huge inventory accumulations and reductions.  And we think right now that we thought last summer when we started buying it that at the price we bought it that that was not an equilibrium price and that sooner or later and we didn't think it was imminent because we don't wait till things are imminent.  uh you know we were going to buy a lot of silver.  we didn't want to buy so much as to really disrupt the market.  however we had no intention of of replaying any any hunt scenario so we wanted to be sure we didn't buy that much silver but we liked it.
