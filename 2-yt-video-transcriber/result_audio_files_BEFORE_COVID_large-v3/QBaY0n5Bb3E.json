Wiseman for letting me know about the update on this murder of this queen here.  And what I did was I wanted to just wait because I wanted a full picture of everything.  And when I had got the link from S. Wiseman, my empathic ability had kicked in.  Anybody that's an empath, you can't control what comes in.  And so there's going to be a twist.  in this story that I'm getting ready to present and I could be wrong I don't always get this right.  keep that in your frontal lobe.  so I mean, the article speaks for itself.  Baltimore police arrest husband near a Mexico border.  as evidence revealed he, not Panhandler, killed his wife.  Also, he ran off with his daughter, too, as well.  This is our queen here, Jacqueline Smith.  And it's just terrible and disgusting.  Just disgusting.  And so I got two videos that I'm going to play the royal family because I want y'all to take it all in.  And I'm going to throw y'all way off why I think he murdered her.  Let's see here.  So first what we're going to hear is a little over six minute video.  And police are doing a press conference here.  So let's start here first. ",

I am joined by our mayor, our state's attorney, our deputy commissioner, our chief of detectives, our homicide commander, and our lead detective sergeant.  On December 1st of last year, we received a 911 call from 52-year-old Keith Smart that his wife Jacqueline had been stabbed to death after giving money to a panhandler in the 1000 block of Valley Street in East Baltimore.  We now know that that was not true.  Earlier this morning, after a lengthy investigation, 52-year-old Keith Smart and his daughter, 28-year-old Valeria Smith, were arrested in Harlington, Texas, near the Mexican border and now have been charged with first-degree murder.  During the course of our investigation, we developed evidence that Mr.  Smith was leaving Maryland, so we made the appropriate national notifications and the Texas State Police arrested him this morning.  All of our investigators prepared arrest warrants for both Keith Smart and Valeria Smith, outlining the evidence in this case to a judge who reviewed and signed the warrants for first-degree murder.  So while I cannot go into tactical or investigative details about the case, so as not to compromise the integrity of the investigation, I can say that there was outstanding detective work involved from the very beginning, and great coordination and collaboration with the State's Attorney's Office, the Maryland Transportation Authority Police, and the Department of Homeland Security.  This case, like all of these cases, certainly is a terrible tragedy.  Jacqueline Smith was an innocent victim, and so I hope you will keep her in your thoughts and in your prayers.  I commend the investigators who worked and continue to work on this case for their tenacity, their thoroughness, their dedication to detail.  And of course, this case remains open and is an ongoing investigation.  So at this time, I'd like to turn it over to our mayor and then to our state's attorney. ",

And I remember this story, too, because what stood out to me when I was watching the video was It was just, it just felt, I felt, it felt odd.  I felt odd energy from his, from his daughter.  I was just, it was just something odd about that.  And like I said again, I could be way off.  But I really deep in my heart think that Jacqueline discovered her husband being quite foul and highly dysfunctional with his 28-year-old daughter.  You know?  And then that's just... And that's just what I'm feeling right now, my royal family.  And I would really like y'all to just be true, you know, honest with me and tell me what y'all feel.  And I often let the royal family know I'm not the only one with this gift.  You were chosen.  We were born here with gifts.  And you know how that thing is where messages will come to us, but then we will probably sometimes be in a state of denial.  It was just really weird, really weird about his daughter.  So anyway, my royal family, that is the end of this.  Please render your voice with your beautiful divine words.  And as always, my royal family, I thank you for your love.  I thank you for your support.  And with that said, Ashe.  And one more thing, my royal family.  Look what number is right below this, her picture.  17.  You can't make these things up.  All right, my royal family.  Ashe.  Ashe. ",
