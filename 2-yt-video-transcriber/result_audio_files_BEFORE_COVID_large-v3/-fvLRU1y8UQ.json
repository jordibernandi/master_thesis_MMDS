A system of voter cards, fingerprints, and more make fraud near impossible.  Every vote can be audited and verified, as they often are.  Their elections are also heavily monitored by independent international observers.  Elections were verified by four different international organizations with observers from over a dozen countries.  One of those observers is the former Spanish Prime Minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, who said, I do not have any doubt about the voting process.  It is an advanced, automated voting system.  Maduro won with 6.2 million votes, which is 31% of eligible voters.  This is the same percentage Barack Obama won in the 2008 election. ",

And he blames the illegal US sanctions, which he says have caused many deaths, have directly and indirectly aggravated the shortage of medicines, including insulin, are crimes against humanity which should be referred to the International Criminal Court.  Strong words from a renowned expert.  But, you know, even if we don't agree on the causes of the problems, I'm sure you would agree that Venezuela is not the only divided country with economic problems.  But it is the only one where there is an unelected self-proclaimed president who has been recognised as a head of state without any basis in law, including by Ireland.  It is the only one where the US military are presently circling and landing, we believe, in the Dominican Republic, in Puerto Rico and in Colombia under the guise of delivering humanitarian aid.  in a situation that is eerily like the weapons of mass destruction lie that was used to sell the Iraq war, on a continent ",

You don't need to be a genius to work out that the humanitarian aid narrative.  It's just a Trojan horse.  Even the official organisations, the International Red Cross and the UN want nothing to do with it.  It's not aid, it's a provocation, it's a cover for military intervention and regime change.  So the question for us is, Are we going to go along with the herd, say nothing, wring our hands afterwards and say, oh, if only we'd known?  Or are we going to speak out now and add our voices to those opposing military aggression and intervention for respecting the sovereignty of Venezuela and to assist them in resolving their differences through dialogue and respect for international law?  Surely that's what a neutral country should be doing.  Anything less is a facilitation of the latest resource war.  We know Venezuela has the largest oil resources in the world.  We know because Trump and Bolton have told us they're in discussions with American oil companies to take the oil of the Venezuelan people.  We know they've wanted that for a long time.  The president's remarks to the room were along the lines of, I don't understand why we're not looking at Venezuela.  Why are we not at war with Venezuela?  They have all the oil and they're right on our back door.  We know they tried to overthrow Ch\u00e1vez, we know the sanctions followed that up, but this is a turning point.  and we know, T\u00e1naiste, what happens next.  Look at Libya, look at Iraq, look at Syria.  Donald Trump says Nicaragua and Cuba are next.
