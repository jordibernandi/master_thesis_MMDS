And thank you, Mr.  Chairman, for introducing into the record the January 9th and January 10th, 2017 memos.  Secretary DeVos, when you made opening remarks, you said that some on this committee suggest full relief for defrauded borrowers.  The point is that it's not just some on this committee.  It was the borrower defense unit in the education department as well, people who had been working on these cases.  That's the point.  And Secretary DeVos, the mission of the Department of Education is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.  And when I look at how the department and you have been handling the borrower defense cases, I just don't see that that is consistent with the message and the mission of the department.  So many hundreds of thousands of students, including thousands in my home state of Oregon, stuck with loan balances and a worthless degree, if they even got a degree.  I'm a former consumer protection lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission, and I know fraud when I see it.  And these students were misled and cheated, and the fact that some of them may be making money doesn't mean that they weren't defrauded.  If somebody went into one of these programs hoping to become a nurse, for example, and now they're selling clothes at a department store, it doesn't mean that they weren't defrauded.  And I hope you can put yourself in the shoes of some of these borrowers.  I know it's challenging, but they went to try to find a better path for themselves.  And instead of getting a good education, they got collection notices and wage garnishments.  And in September, the department admitted to violating a court order by illegally demanding loan payment from more than 16,000 Corinthian borrowers seeking borrower defense.  And that number has now increased to 45,000.  And the issue came to the public's attention only after you were held in contempt for violating a court order.  So this is not a new problem.  In fact, more than a year ago, a court ordered the department to stop seizing tax returns of borrower defense applicants.  That was the Williams case.  So you and the department have known about this issue for years.  So why did the department continue to bill more than 16,000 Corinthian borrowers in violation of the law? ",

Since then, a year later, there were errors made within Federal Student Aid and with some of our servicers human errors that once we became aware of them, we immediately acknowledged and immediately went to work to correct and rectify the problems for those impacted students.
