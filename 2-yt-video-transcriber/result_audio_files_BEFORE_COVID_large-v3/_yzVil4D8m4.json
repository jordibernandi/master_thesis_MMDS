Your confession will be jotted down and the decision to fine, prosecute or release will depend upon whatever the mood is of that officer at the time.

Just remember though that body-worn video is there to protect them and not you and although you can request a copy of it via subject access.  they do have a habit of losing or damaging footage as well as obstructing requests until the 31 day limit has exceeded for footage to be deleted.  So even if the police are recording you it's essential that you record them on your own device.  Any officer who uses your right to film them as a means to further his suspicion of you and prolongs your detention simply for filming them could constitute a false imprisonment. ",

He does do the right thing by asking them what evidence they have, and stupidly they admit.  all they have is each other's word.  A police officer's word is about as reliable as a Nigerian banknote.  Even the Crown Prosecution Service know this, which is why they've become increasingly wary of prosecuting cases that involve just two police officers' word and no material evidence.  This is why it's helpful to ascertain whether you've been stopped by a couple of bored cops in a divisional response vehicle or whether you've been stopped by traffic officers from a road policing unit.  In speeding offences, evidence is generally accepted from any of the following.  Opinion of two officers who witnessed the vehicle being driven.  One officer supported by an approved speed detection device.  Approved speed detection equipment.  One officer supported by a calibrated police vehicle speedometer.  Most response vehicles do not have calibrated speedometers.  Therefore, a single officer who claims to have witnessed you going over the limit in a standard response vehicle would not be sufficient evidence to prosecute.  Unless, of course, you admit the offence when stopped.  How can you tell if you've been stopped by a fully equipped Rhodes policing vehicle?  Well, the best way is to ask the officer if he's a traffic cop, because each force might use different vehicles in their fleet for different purposes.  In the case of Merseyside Police, a Freedom of Information request exists on the What Do They Know?  site that lists the entirety of their marked fleet, including registration numbers.  Their road policing unit uses the Vauxhall Vectra, the Volvo V70 D5, the BMW 5 Series and the BMW 3 Series.  The majority of uncalibrated response vehicles are Hyundai i30s.  You can also find a list of what vehicles each force carries by looking at their individual Wikipedia entries. ",
