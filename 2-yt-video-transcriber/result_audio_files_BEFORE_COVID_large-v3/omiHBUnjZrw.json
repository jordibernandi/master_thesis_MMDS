Now as far as videos go, I'm gonna take it a little bit easier for December.  Theophilus McFernandez, I know I just did you, but let's go again, bud.  Since it's Christmas time, let's check out the real meaning of Christmas.  Normally what I like to do these days to get a transcript of what I'm responding to is just grab that auto-generated YouTube transcript.  Those used to be pretty bad, but they've gotten reasonably accurate these days, so it doesn't usually require all that much fixing up to become fully accurate.  But unfortunately, this time that's a slight problem, because YouTube seems to think Theophilus speaks Korean.  And I can't help being a little curious what the AI thinks he's actually saying in Korean.  Domestic starlook Skintone Kubekata lets trade, and got big wiser.  If it's two Knickers members per day, trek 5,000 yards with Stoweir.  I hope again a foot, okay?  Looper bang down to five.  We, uh, first of all, the pack is cheap and looks so meaningful.  What's this on the stimulus?  Bad Tube Arthur Christmas?  This probably didn't have a Thiashio chatroom.  Three movie kids on- Oh, let's stop there.  Please don't throw lightning at me, Mrs.  Wojcicki. ",

Do I get into some deep dive into the origins of Christmas and the date that was chosen for it, or some kind of philosophical discussion of whether the meaning of a holiday is more closely tied to the origin of the date it's celebrated on, if the December 25th date actually was chosen to Christianize a Roman holiday, or whether the meaning of the holiday is whatever it means to the people who celebrate it.  No, none of the above.  This is Theophilus, I'm just gonna replay Saint Valentine whacking himself in the face.  Don't talk back to me, bitch!  True meaning truly Christian, right?  Not true like the holiday is factually true.  Okay, but regardless of why they chose the particular day, it's still explicitly about Jesus and stuff.  I mean, it's taken by Christians to be a celebration of that.  Sure, some non-Christian people like me join in and treat it as a secular holiday, but Still, I guess you're more on the side that thinks the origin of a celebration is the be-all end-all of what it can ever be or represent for the rest of time, eh?  Seems a little narrow-minded and also kind of like a waste of mental energy to worry about, but that's not my problem, I guess, so go nuts.  Was he really a pimpstitute who wants to bang Rudolph?  What about a plane?  Oh, good.  What about a butterfly?  I don't think that's it.  Ah, right.  Can't forget the weird helicopter.  Is that all?  Guess that's all.

Yeah, we want to give in December.  Yeah.  It's more fun for the kids that way.  I mean, sure, if you get a present every month, it's kind of fun, but it's more fun if you get a whole bunch on one day.  Makes it a big special event instead of just some other day.  And I think most people wouldn't want to give that up just to avoid hurting the other 11 months' feelings.  I know.  That's why you very rarely see people dressing up as the white men in red on Halloween.  Or for that matter, as zombies on Christmas.
