So if you're asking for something like, could I have a glass of water?  means, could I have a glass of water, please?  But you can also use the word when you give somebody something.  So let's say you serve them a plate of food and you can say, which is like, here you are, or you're welcome.  Now the word actually means in request.  So when somebody says, may I have something in request, please.  It's like a word of respect.  So this week, when you're asking for something or when you're offering something to someone, you can say, here you go.  Thank you. ",
