            "text": "Awareness, very important.  Now, people don't believe Justice Mueller right now.  We don't trust the trick and we shouldn't.  We also shouldn't be trusting the media and we also shouldn't be trusting politicians at this point because they lied to us.  Media told us that it was real originally.  A lot of people were hurt by hearing that.  And what this system would like to tell you is, oh fake news, it's so harmful, people are hurt, therefore we need to do this, this and this.  Joke.  The media and politicians told us these lies.  They were being harmful.  Are they going to be censored?  No.  But just do I want to advocate for something like that?  No.  I just want to make sure that you understand that that's a little thing that needs to be looked at.  They're liars.  They want to selectively censor people.  is what I'm saying.  When we're talking about this.  We're talking about one person.  We're talking about that Jussie Smollett and we're talking about how he's lying and how he lied to all of us and how he tried to take advantage of the political climate of people reacting to MAGA hats and looking at race all the time.  The gay versus straight thing, he used that against us in the same way that this government does.  The same way that the FBI does.  What do you mean?  I don't know what you're talking about.  That's what you want to say.  You want to say, what do I mean?  Well, look up COINTELPRO.  Yeah.  Look up how the Democrats used the KKK to attack people and actually lynch people for not voting Democrat.  That's very related to this whole anti-luncheon bill.  So this story was very much the agenda that they wanted to push on us originally.  Now it's botched.  Nobody believes it.  So what I want to zero in on is how then the system would try to take back some control.  They will use their little fake accounts.  They will use their little QAnon trick jokers.  And then they will try to spin it into something that they can somehow gain credibility back.  Well, how could they do that?  Well, they want people to then just say, oh, it was Cory Booker and Kamala Harris working with Jussie Smollett.  Yeah, this is their whole plan to get the anti-lynching bill passed.  Meaning they work together.  Why is it so important?  Because then they can come out and say, oh, they're going to debunk it.  They can gain the credibility back.  Oh, we're going to look at them.  Oh, they know what they're talking about.  They use their little PolitiFact, little liars, and their little Snopes, another little liars.  Both of them have an agenda.  that's not keeping the truth.  People come over here and they leave their little comments.  They say, oh, look, Jussie Smollett was in a picture with Kamala Harris.  As if I'm supposed to then take that, you suggest that, and you think it's so powerful that I'm going to make a video saying that very thing.  Knowing full well that the system wants that.  Ain't going to happen.  But I will break it down in the correct way.  Yes, there is a correct way to do that.  Let's look at a quote of Cory Booker.  Nick Kamala Harris.  Huh.  Back to Cory Booker.  So we have a situation where a politician is using a hoax to then get us to support some legislation.  This is proven, this is a documentation, no questions about it.  Now, why is this so important?  First of all, because it's messed up.  Second of all, because I've seen this before.  I've seen people pretend to be victims.  I've seen politicians come out and use that same exact hoax to push legislation.  It is now on record and it cannot be denied and you better believe I will use this as evidence.  Now that is the message that you get from this, the takeaway.  It's disgusting.  Who's gonna call them out for that?  I don't think CNN is gonna really call them out the way they should be called out.  There's only a few select people that are gonna do that.  So I'm gonna go even further.  because what's happening here is Cory Booker and Kamala Harris are going for black points.  You probably never heard the term, and it's a term that I thought of when I saw what they're doing.  Perfect explanation for what they're doing.  Hey, hey, look, look, we're black politicians, so if you're black or you want a president or something like Barack Obama, you gotta vote for us.  See?  Anti-lynching bill.  See?  See that?  Remember back in the day?  They did lynchings on black people.  See what we're doing?  Nasty.  Now, if we really want to talk about why these anti-lynching measures were not passed, it's because the Democrats.  And remember, I am an independent.  There was a man named Leonidas Dyer.  He presented the anti-lynching bill.  And the Democrats, what they want to say on Wikipedia?  that shows up on the bottom of my videos when I talk about things that the government doesn't like you to talk about, and it's supposed to be more credible, so I'm using that.  So now, PolitiFact, you can't come out and say, oh, we debunked, you ain't debunking nothing, you stupid trick.  Now you sit here and listen to what I have to say.  Southern Democrats, they want to say, chop off Southern and just say Democrats because that's who did it.  They blocked the freaking bill from passing.  We had the Ku Klux Klan, who was the strong arm of the Democratic Party, out there lynching people because they weren't voting Democrat.  The lynchings were done by the Southern whites, they're saying, to maintain social control, white supremacy, and Democratic Party rule.  Democratic Party rule synonymous with white supremacy.  Democratic Party is the same ones who brought the Jim Crow laws.  Understand, when the Democratic Party took control of the Senate, that's when the original civil rights movement stopped.  Again, when you see Kamala Harris, when you see Cory Booker coming out, they are only trying to score black points.  Which is just sick.  And remember your history.  Understand that they always trying to use race to control us.  And oh, because you black, I'm supposed to vote for you.  Uh-uh.  I don't accept that crap.  Red, silver, J. All I gotta say. ",
