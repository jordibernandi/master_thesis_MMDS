            "text": "It's not illegal.  VivaFry Montreal litigator-turned-YouTuber, and it is vlog time.  And yes, I recognize that that Simpsons clip was a little contextually inapplicable, but a Simpsons clip makes every vlog funnier.  The word on the street is that Hillary Clinton has now twice refused to accept service of Tulsi Gabbard's lawsuit for defamation.  And for those of you who are unaware, yes, Tulsi Gabbard is suing Hillary Clinton for defamation for $50 million.  $50!  $50 million.  The lawsuit itself is based on certain comments that Hillary Clinton made about Tulsi Gabbard during a podcast in which she referred to Tulsi Gabbard as a Russian asset.  And Tulsi Gabbard filed a $50 million lawsuit against Hillary Clinton on the basis that being called a Russian asset is somewhat defamatory, especially in the context of Tulsi Gabbard's run to become the Democratic nominee for the presidential campaign to become president of the United States of America.  Now, I actually did a vlog where I walked through Tulsi Gabbard's actual lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, paragraph by paragraph, virtually, explaining what was going on in that lawsuit.  If you have not yet seen that video, I'm gonna link it right here.  Give it a watch when you have a chance.  In October 2019, whether out of personal animus, political enmity, or fear of real change within a political party Clinton and her allies have long dominated, Clinton lied about her perceived rival, Tulsi Gabbard.  She did so publicly, unambiguously, and with obvious malicious intent.  Tulsi has been harmed by Clinton's lies, and American democracy has suffered as well.  With this action, Tulsi seeks to hold Clinton and the political elites who enable her accountable for distorting the truth in the middle of a critical presidential election.  And I've done a ton of videos on defamation itself, what needs to be alleged, what needs to be proven, how.  the threshold is somewhat different depending on whether or not you're a private citizen versus a public figure.  And we probably know it reflexively by now, but in order for a public figure to succeed on a defamation claim, they need to prove actual malice with respect to the defamatory comments.  But whatever, this video is not about defamation.  If you need to bone up or refresh your memory on defamation law, I will link my defamation vlog playlist right here.  Give that a watch.  Now, because I am talking about a very specific aspect of law, I want to make something abundantly clear.  Nothing in this video constitutes legal advice.  If you need legal advice, consult a competent attorney in the proper jurisdiction, and they will give you an opinion after having heard all of the facts and after having analyzed those facts in accordance with the applicable law.  And just as another parenthesis, I often get comments either by Facebook, email, or DM asking me legal questions.  My answer is always the same.  I never give legal advice.  Not only that, beware of anybody that would give you legal advice based on an email, a DM, a tweet, whatever.  In order to give proper legal advice, not only do you have to know the applicable law in the proper jurisdiction, but you have to know the facts.  One fact omitted, one false fact included can change an entire opinion.  Parentheses closed.  Now, service, what is it?  Service is a fancy or technical term for formally delivering court documents.  When somebody decides to sue somebody, they go and they draft their legal proceedings,  etc.,  etc.,  but they need to serve those documents on the defendant.  They need to make the defendant aware of the lawsuit that is filed against them.  And when I say that the law is jurisdictional, that is to say that the methods of service itself will vary from one jurisdiction to another.  Not only will the methods of service vary from one jurisdiction to another, but the methods of service will vary from one document to another.  There are sometimes specific rules of service for specific court documents.  So there might be one rule of service for a lawsuit, the motion to institute proceedings.  But there may be different rules of service for, say, a subpoena.  A subpoena is a formal court document compelling a witness to show up at court to testify.  So service may be different from one country to the next.  It may be different from one province to the next.  It may be different from one state to the next.  But the idea is that when you sue someone, you need to get that lawsuit to them.  You need to make sure that they are aware of the lawsuit that has been filed against them so that they can defend against it.  And it would seem that Hillary Clinton, for whatever the reason, is seemingly refusing to accept service of the lawsuit Tulsi Gabbard has filed against her.  Now, according to the New York Post, and yes, I know what a lot of you are going to say about the New York Post as a newspaper, but this is what they're reporting.  Hillary Clinton has now twice snubbed a process server attempting to deliver the defamation lawsuit filed against her by Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, according to Gabbard's attorney.  Yes, this is being reported in the New York Post, and yes, this is according to Tulsi Gabbard's attorneys, but this really is just a matter of fact.  It's not really a matter of political spin.  Apparently, Hillary Clinton has twice snubbed a process server.  Now, a process server literally is the person that legally serves documents on another person.  They are called process servers in some jurisdictions, bailiffs in others, but they are basically people who are empowered under the law to serve proceedings.  I find it rather unbelievable that Hillary Clinton is so intimidated by Tulsi Gabbard that she won't accept service of process, the Congresswoman's attorney Brian Dunn told the Post.  But I guess here we are.  Now, bearing in mind that this is all according to Tulsi Gabbard's attorney, so take it with a grain of salt, but what seems to be happening here is that the process server was denied first by the Secret Service and then by Hillary Clinton's own attorney.  And in law, depending on your jurisdiction, the attorney for a party can accept service of the documents.  They can accept service, but then they have to confirm that they have validly accepted service for and on behalf of their clients.  And why is this question of service even relevant to begin with?  Well, in law, improper service of a court proceeding can be a defense against that court proceeding.  Improper service, although a purely procedural issue, can have substantive impacts on a file.  Improper service of a lawsuit?  Well, it's as though that lawsuit has never been served on the defendant, period.  So if the party goes out and attempts to get a judgment by default against the defendant, and they try to execute on that judgment, the defendant can say, whoa, your judgment by default is totally inapplicable to me, because I was never properly served with the lawsuit in the first place.  When it comes to subpoenas, improper service of the subpoenas creates no obligation on the recipient.  A subpoena is an order of the court.  If it is properly served on an individual, it creates legal obligations for that individual.  If the subpoena is properly served and the individual doesn't show up to court on the date indicated in the subpoena, they can, in theory, be held in contempt of court.  Procedural improprieties can be a defense against sanctions that could otherwise be imposed by the court against an individual.  And when it comes to judgments, if a party is unaware of a judgment that was rendered by the court, it is going to be kind of difficult to hold them in contempt of court for defying that judgment.  And that's exactly why judgments need to be served on the party, so that there is no question as to whether or not the parties were aware of the existence of the judgment and the terms of the judgment.  And if one is not inclined to like lawyers, this is not going to make them like lawyers anymore.  But Hillary Clinton's lawyer could validly accept service of Tulsi Gabbard's lawsuit against Hillary Clinton.  But in the game of litigation, there are no favors, and this lawyer is playing procedural hardball.  He is basically saying, my client has not confirmed that I can accept service for and on her behalf, so find her and serve her properly.  But at the end of the day, this is all procedural and political theater.  The reason being that whatever the specific rules of service are in the appropriate jurisdiction, most courts will allow for alternative modes of service, relatively easily, just on demand.  If the person refuses to open their front door to accept service personally, all the petitioning party would have to do, presumably, is go to court and ask that they be allowed to serve through the mailbox.  Or that they be allowed to serve the person at his or her place of business if that's not already a valid mode of service to begin with.  I was involved in a file where a party actually asked for permission to serve documents by way of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter, and they got permission to do it.  You can get permission to serve by way of public notice by publication in a newspaper, and how hilarious would it be if Tulsi Gabbard actually gets permission to serve by way of public notice and publishes the lawsuit in a newspaper?  Oh my goodness, if somebody wants to play procedural hardball, this would be one heck of a response.  But this is just political theater, it is procedure for the sake of procedure, although it can have substantive impacts on a file.  Tulsi Gabbard's lawsuit is going to get properly served sooner than later, although Tulsi might have to go to court and get authorization for another mode of service.  Although we all know darn well that Hillary Clinton is well aware of the lawsuit and what is alleged in that lawsuit.  I will be following this story closely, and I strongly suspect that the first thing we're going to see in this lawsuit, after proper service, is going to be a motion to dismiss on one of two bases.  It's either going to be your standard motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Rule 12b-6, or Hillary Clinton might actually raise the sovereign immunity defense, even though, in my humble opinion, it wouldn't necessarily apply because Hillary Clinton did not hold a position in office when she made the statements.  But it would be an interesting question in law as to whether or not sovereign immunity can follow someone even after they no longer hold a position in office.  We'll see.

I am also a proud husband, father of three, loving owner of two dogs, and I have gone through what some might call a midlife crisis, but others might call a moment of awakening.  I studied philosophy and history at McGill University, where I got an honors degree in philosophy, before going to Universit\u00e9 Laval to study law in Quebec City.  Fresh out of law school, I got an internship at one of Canada's largest law firms at the time, where I practiced for about five years.  I specialized in commercial litigation, and for those of you who don't really know what that is, that is the I'll-see-you-in-court lawyer.  I was sworn in as a lawyer in 2007, and I've been practicing ever since.  But a decade of commercial litigation can take its toll on anybody.  It is literally lawfare day in and day out.  It's lawfare with opposing counsel. ",

And it's not just the nature of commercial litigation that takes a toll on the person, it's the lifestyle itself.  As a young lawyer, you are expected to work 10 to 12 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week.  And oftentimes, it's not only about the work, it's about what we refer to as FaceTime, just being in the office and having people see you working.  And after we had our first kid, I quickly realized that this was not a sustainable lifestyle for me. ",
