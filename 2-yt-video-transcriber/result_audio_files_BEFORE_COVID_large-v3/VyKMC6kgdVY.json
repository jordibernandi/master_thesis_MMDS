Kent's unaccredited education is from a literal trailer in the middle of nowhere.  Again, not something I care about or I'd normally mention, except he's bringing up qualifications.  It's not even Kent's education that makes him woefully undermatched.  He either can't, or refuses to, even articulate the theory of biological evolution as held by those he feigns to debate.  If you can't articulate your opponent's position, you're not actually fighting your opponent's position.  You're fighting something else.  I would suggest that Kent move his channel over to Makeup Tutorials, but makeup is far more complicated than anything I've seen from a Hovind.  This may sound like I'm white knighting Rachel.  Trust me, I'm well aware that she needs zero help from me or anyone in refuting whatever Kent will say.  But his utter condescension is so vile, I just had to let everyone get a glimpse of Angry Paul.  And I'm doing this with Rachel's blessing.  She's far too busy having an amazing time tonight to give Kent a moment of her thoughts.  I don't curse on my channel, but I do kind of wish that hell was an actual place.  Because if it was, I'd really like to invite Kent to pick up his vile misogynist attitude and go there.  Sorry for the unpleasantness.  Let's cleanse our palate by focusing on what's really important this Thanksgiving season.  Christmas.  A number of atheist YouTubers are soon winding up a drive to raise funds to help less fortunate families have a better Christmas this year.  If you're willing and able, there's still a little time to contribute to this amazing cause, and you can find a link in the description.  If you do, please tell them that Kent Hovind sent you.  And speaking of Kent and the holidays, let's wrap this up with the newest single from his Christmas album, debuting on Skylar Fiction's channel for some reason.
