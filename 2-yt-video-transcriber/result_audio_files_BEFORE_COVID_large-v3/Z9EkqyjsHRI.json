            "text": "Hey friends, I wanted to talk to you today about something I haven't talked about publicly yet, but I feel like y'all, being my YouTube audience, I have a different sort of relationship with you than I do, let's say, with my Facebook audience.  And I want to share things with you that are a little more personal.  So here's what's going on.  It has to do with my story of hormones.  Let's start with when I went through puberty, which was in the late 80s is when that happened.  I didn't know it at the time, but I had elevated testosterone, which just naturally elevated testosterone, which makes a lot of sense and explains a lot of things about when I was younger, especially hair growth.  Like I had my hair on my legs so hairy and dark.  My arms, I was like growing it on my knuckles.  and uh on like my face and things like that and I was very very ashamed of it.  at the time I didn't know what was going on.  why was I so weird and different?  um I also had irregular periods and so I ended up getting on birth control very young and nowadays we know that that is probably an indicator of PCOS but back then I don't know.  maybe it just wasn't paid attention to.  so Let's fast forward and go into my early adulthood, early twenties and whatnot.  I did eventually stop birth control, but if you think about it, it turns out I'm non-binary.  It turns out that my hormones, my balance of hormones is really important.  So the fact that me and none of my medical health practitioners, we didn't know that.  I was on birth control, which increased the amount of estrogen I had in me.  So it's almost like I got the opposite HRT.  that would feel right for me, but I didn't know it.  So it makes sense, I think, that I started to really struggle with PMS during that time.  Like during the premenstrual time, I would just... It turns out that later in life I got diagnosed with having PMDD, which is premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  In fact, just as early as this spring, I got a psychological evaluation and that's the number one thing that came up.  So let's just then say for the course of my lifetime, I've had issues with hormones and for the longest time we blamed it on PMS, PMDD, just being very specific about that when it comes to it being more so me relating to it as a female.  And then once I realized I was non-binary, I was able to be more open with my practitioners, but it still has taken a few years for us to figure out how do we approach it?  Because not only was I experiencing PMS symptoms, but I was experiencing gender dysphoria while I had PMS at the same time.  So that was just a really big aha moment for me.  It helped explain a lot because during times of stress for myself, my anxiety sky high.  And so that's why I got a psychological exam this past spring.  There was a lot going on in my life.  I've told you about my daughter getting ready for college and we went on a lot of college tours and we did a lot of exploring and things like that.  And just so my routine was off and I was experiencing stress, which is fine.  That happens, except then you mix it in with my hormone issues, blah.  So it was really helpful to get that psychological evaluation.  Later, I will tell you a little bit more about what the evaluation also said about me, which I wasn't necessarily surprised, but I haven't shared that publicly yet as well.  But let's stick with the hormones for now.  So what I decided to do was start seeing a physician here in town who I know specializes in working with trans clients and hormones.  And so I know it sounds strange.  Why wasn't I working with somebody before like that?  You know, I tried and either they weren't taking my insurance or I think I just was okay with the fact that I had a naturopath, which has been really, really helpful to me over the years.  But when I went to this doctor and she tested my blood levels, you know, the new one that I'm seeing, it turns out for one my testosterone is below normal female range.  you know what i mean.  um so and my doctor is really good about saying we don't really let's forget about like what's the normal range for females.  you know what feels good or bad for you and the fact that i was explaining about feeling low energy and the tendency to experience stress Um, and not be able to handle it mood swings.  So she's like, this makes sense.  Your testosterone is way low.  And so that's why I'm starting to use the gel.  I am not using much of this.  I am bad at numbers and things like that.  Like if you asked me how many milligrams are you using or grams or how much tea is in it?  I don't know.  I just squeeze it and it ends up being like a size of a chickpea.  is what my doctor told me.  And I use just two of those a day.  That's all.  Because I'm not trying to masculinize to the point of let's say some other people When it's their goals, what they use testosterone gel, I'm just starting a little bit at a time.  And I think potentially it might be microdosing.  when, you know, when you think about it, maybe that's, I would say that's what I'm doing.  My main goal is to get to a normal range, but what's my normal?  What feels good for me?  My doctor's like, let's just try out.  See how it goes.  So for a few months, I'm gonna stay with that amount.  And then towards November or so, if everything's going good, I'm gonna increase it.  See how that feels.  Not to try to confuse you more, but I'm also taking progesterone.  This isn't a pill form.  That's strange, you might say.  That's what a lot of times people who are wanting to feminize more will take.  Well, for one, maybe it's also strange because I'm non-binary.  So it's like masculinize, feminize.  But the progesterone is actually the goal is to trick my body into thinking it's pregnant.  So I will not have my monthly cycle anymore.  That should help me with my mood swings as well.  So I wanted to update you and tell you about this.  And there's a couple of reasons for that.  For one, I've been open with you about my non-binary.  journey and this is a big part of it.  I would say.  for two I think it's just a mental health check-in in general that I think anybody whether you're cis whether you're trans or anywhere in between hormones are really important.  if you don't have the right balance of what feels right to you it can really really mess things up.  one reason my testosterone started to tank is because I'm probably entering perimenopause.  This is going to be like this next time of my life, 10 years or whatever.  I'm going to have to pay really close attention to my hormones because things are going to start changing and they want to be sure I'm staying on top of it because I'm so sensitive to those changes.  And a lot of people are sensitive to that.  So perhaps this is something that you've been thinking about, whether it has to do with transition or just in general, if you're just feeling off, if you're able to.  And again, I'm very... privilege that I do have the ability to afford health insurance.  And my health insurance does cover my visits with my doctor and it helps to pay partially for the medications.  If you're able to get your blood work done, because that also would be a cost to see if your insurance covers the blood work, specifically ask to have your hormones tested.  And then it's less about what's the normal range for male or female.  And it's more about, huh, tell me again how you're not feeling well.  And then you know, your doctor takes notes and says, hmm, this might make sense since your estrogen is low or your progesterone is too high or your testosterone is too low or too high.  It's, I don't know, I just can't say enough about how important it is to be sure not to forget to look at hormones in general, besides the fact, like even if you're transitioning and things start to feel weird or off or you're not sure what's going on, get your hormones tested.  And a lot of you already are doing that or you will be doing that if that's the path you're going on because it's important to get those check-ins.  but sometimes that's really one of the biggest answers for it.  so well that's my update on how i'm doing about all of that.  uh i enjoy talking to you on this more personal level from time to time for sure.  i'm actually at my apartment right now just sitting outside on the porch and i was just thinking you know i think i'd like to share this uh with everyone.  So, like I said, feel free to leave any comments about your experiences with this.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Okay. ",
