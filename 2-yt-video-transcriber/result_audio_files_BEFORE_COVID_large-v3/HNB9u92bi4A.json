Breaking our shops, killing our brothers, burning our shops, stealing our things.  And police are not doing anything.  Police are holding their head, watching them killing us, burning our shops.  And the government is not saying anything.  We're all disappointed and we're very sad that in our continent, they're calling us foreigners.  chasing us.  so what we want uh government to do?  government was interfere before.  this is going to escalate because uh everybody is very sad like today.  our shop are closed from morning till now.  we also pay taxes.  uh support our kids pay rents.  we are not happy about them.  this mass demonstration one of the indian is killed of which is the permanent citizens in our country south africa woke up and said that foreigners must go.  I keep asking myself, foreigners, black people must leave Africa.  What kind of thing is that?  Is it what Nelson Mandela worked for?  Is it what all the activists worked for?  Taking our women away, now they're making us run in the streets.  Yeah, yeah.  We will not let this happen.  We will do something about this.  Which wives?  My wife is a Nigerian.  So what type of taking your wives?  Talking about jobs.  I got camping, I got shops.  And 10 South Africans are working for me.  So they should be very, very happy that I'm here.  So, and we have to, please, both the governments, both the African countries must come together, join hands, and allow peace to reign.  Thank you.  We are absolutely not happy about what is happening in our country.  So, please, government, consider our views.  We want to know what is democracy.  You have to ask more police to stop them.  That's risky.  You're not stopping them.  They are calling us.  Never.  You're not stopping them.  I can't fight you anymore.  If they want to fire them, I swear I won't fight you anymore.  Why?  Why?  We want government to do something about it.  We don't want people to do business while they are not permitted.  They are coming with drugs.  They got a bad influence.  Before we came here, way back in the days, there was drugs in South Africa.  That means they must do something, like they must try to find something to make them right, and maybe they must just try to find a transport and move them to their homes.  Not like to hit them and kill them.  It's not right at all.  I don't know.  The South African Police Service recently launched a Chinese community and police cooperation center in Port Elizabeth.  This is the 13th such center to be opened nationally.  Now, Eastern Cape Police Commissioner Lizzy Wenjinga says the service has benefited by finding its role in order to further the existing relations within the Chinese community.  Many have raised concerns about the nature of relations between the South African government and China.  members of the South African police and private security personnel will receive training here.  The project has been two years in the making and 80 police officers have since received training.  We are living here, we are doing business here, as we are studying here.  And then how we can be a better look after it, it's so critical that we have a good relationship with the local community, with the staffs.  with the local CPF because those are the people that are dealing with the Chinese national and the Delhi base.  These are the people appointed by the South African government as a public servant to look after us.  The South African government has also pledged their support for this initiative.  The training centre has been fully funded by the Chinese government.  The key objective of opening this learning centre is an initiative that was started by the Chinese embassy.  After they were consulted by business people who've got business interests within the province and nationally, after they experienced incidents and attacks in terms of crime and robberies, They found a challenge and difficulty whenever they went to the police station to report cases.  So we wanted to break the boundary and the barrier in terms of language.  This Chinese training centre will not operate as a police station but will be used to empower emergency personnel.  Zolani Moya, SABC News, Port Elizabeth.  As South Africa's men and women in blue, their duty is to serve and protect.  But during the past few months, they've also been committed to expanding their cultural and language knowledge by studying Mandarin.  Weekly beginners and intermediate classes were held here at the Chinese Community Police Forum near Cape Town.  The classes for 40 students were sponsored by the Chinese Embassy in South Africa, the Cape Academy of Maths, Science and Technology and the Chinese Community Police Forum.  Students receive training in listening to Chinese, basic Mandarin grammar and advanced conversation and pronunciation.  As a police, I think either in Chinese police or the South African police, the community policing is very beneficial for the whole police work.  And we are both of us aware the security in South Africa is not so good as we expect.  So with more and more police, local police of South African to study Chinese.  And they can get along with the local Chinese community and they can understand, basically understand the Chinese culture, the Chinese language and easy for them to get along with the Chinese shoppers or Chinese shop owners and easy for them to carry out their police work.  We can see the result, we can see the program, and we can see the process which they made.  They worked so hard during the day and the long hours working in their office.  But they surprised us by doing a good job in Mandarin.  The Mandarin course material is designed to help improve communication between members of the South African Police Service and members of the South African Chinese community.  But many of the police officers taking the course say they've also fallen in love with Chinese culture.  Prior to the Chinese learning program, when we had a complaint with the Chinese national, we couldn't understand half of the words they're saying because the English dialect to the Chinese dialect, you know, is not that good.  But now that we have taken up this class, now it's much easier now because most of the time we can understand them, we can respond as well as we can hear as well what they have to say.  When I hear some people speak Chinese, I can take a few words I can hear there, I can, you know, I can take in what they're actually trying to say, yeah, so it has helped a lot.  My name is Daga Chiaobongi.  I'm 24 years old.  I'm from Nanfair.  I live in Hanyu.  I live in Hanyu.  I'm a police officer.  The Mandarin classes for police officers in South Africa will be offered again next year.  And the Chinese embassy in South Africa has promised to try and make opportunities available for some students to travel to the People's Republic of China in the near future. ",
