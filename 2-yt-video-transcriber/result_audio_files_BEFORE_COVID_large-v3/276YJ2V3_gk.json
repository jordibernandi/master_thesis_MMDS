            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to Moonride.  I know a lot of people are asking a lot of questions right now about what's going on.  There are actually so many questions I often don't know what to ask.  However, I think the most important thing to notice is that we are getting closer and closer to some justice.  Every day I look at the news, I see that more truths are becoming obvious and that pretty much even Republicans cannot argue these points.  So I just want you to notice things really are improving.  They are getting better.  They're not getting worse.  And that's really, really important.  It's important for your sanity.  It's important for all of us to know that justice is coming.  Now, in the meantime, I'd just like to know about Mueller's report.  Some people say it's coming out real soon, and I'd just like to find out.  And also I'm just going to ask, what are the most important details that we'll get out of Mueller's report?  So Spirit, can you tell us when will we get the report out?  When will we see it?  Should it say, when will it come out?  And when will we see it?  Two separate questions.  Okay.  Okay.  Just to let you know, I keep seeing a shirt, a white shirt.  Not sure what that means, but it kind of gives me the feeling of dirty laundry.  So can you tell us, what about the white shirt spirit?  What does that mean?  Hmm.  All right.  There is a lot of laundry going on.  Lots and lots of white shirts on the line.  And Mueller is putting them all out there.  There's lots and lots of white shirts.  This just tells me there's going to be a lot of people implicated in this.  Each shirt seems like a separate person.  So a lot of people will be implicated when he shows his work.  Um, Trump of course is furious.  Um, he's apoplectic and, um, you know, he's really gone nuts on this one.  That is Donald Trump.  Hmm.  And, um, I'm also seeing the, that little toady character of his, um, Steven, he's the guy that, um, You know, the racist guy that works with him.  It's not Steve Bannon, but Steve Miller, I think it is.  Yeah.  What's up with Miller?  Some truth is coming out about him, too.  He's looking relatively quiet in this image.  And a little bit frightened.  Hmm.  This seems to have exposed him in some particular way.  And I often think of, you know, Stephen Miller as the overt racist.  You know, there are other people who are racists, but, um, He's sort of the center of the overt racism that exists in the Trump administration.  So I think that his racism overall will be exposed.  That is Trump's and the people there.  I think he has been much more explicit in his overt racism and this will be exposed.  Do we have an idea of when?  When will Mueller's report come out?  I'm getting a watch.  To me, it seems like that means quite soon.  That is, I'm getting a watch as opposed to a calendar.  So I think it's fairly soon.  Some people have suggested Monday, this coming Monday.  Is that a possibility, Spirit?  I'm not getting that for certain.  It's not clear when it is.  I think it's actually maybe not been decided yet what day it will come out.  And it does have something to do with Barr.  William Barr is... I mean, I've seen Barr releasing this, but let's make sure.  Will Barr release the report?  I think he will, but there'll be a bit of a delay.  Uh, it's, it's so serious as consequences are so serious for all of us that he really has to take this into account and think for a while, like, how can we do this?  Because it's such a, it'll be a shock to the society that we live in.  It will be so fraught that they really are trying to think of at least bars, trying to think of how can I do this, uh, without, um, some kind of disaster.  And that is a real concern.  He's not playing politics here.  It is a true concern.  And I do think Barr is going to release the information.  I think he will have no choice because if he tries to cover it up, it'll be extremely explosive.  And he is aware of this.  He's also aware that it is ultimately his duty to do that.  And he is wondering if he should redact some of it or, you know, maybe, but he's like, no, I shouldn't because, you know, people will, it'll just add more suspicion.  Why did you redact that of all the things?  Why did you redact those two things?  You know, that is... he's really wrestling with this issue.  And I have to say that it seems sincere.  I don't feel like he's doing what he's doing for his own political purposes or anyone else's.  I think he really is very interested in the law and his reputation.  Spirit, is there anything else that we need to know about the report, Mueller report?  It's going to change history.  It really will be like, um, you know, a bombshell, like it'll be like declaring the civil war, you know, it'll be that, um, a major of an event.  Um, and there will be commotion in our society.  There will be people who are being inspired to be active and there will be threats, but I think it will work itself out.  Just, you know, viewers, just be sure that when you get involved in this, you go in there, you know, eyes wide open.  Be sure that you don't get carried away in these events because they really are, you know, fraught with some risks and I don't anticipate anything terrible happening.  I'm not being shown anything, but I am being told to tell you to be careful.  And that's even on an emotional level.  You know, when you're going into this, know why you're doing it.  Don't engage in arguments with some people that aren't productive.  Don't do destructive things that can be filmed and then support the State of emergency, you know, now Trump has to come in and stop the battle that's happening between two opposing groups.  Do not go there.  That will just be fuel to the fire.  And I don't anticipate Americans will do that.  But don't get too emotionally invested in what you're doing.  Justice is being pursued.  We are seeing it in more and more clarity every single day.  So it will happen.  It's just a question of time.  Again, I'm getting soon.  I don't know if it'll come out Monday, though.  I'm not getting that.  I kind of get a week from Monday, but that is not at all clear.  It's just sort of up in the air there.  I'm not sure if it's really certain when this will come out yet.  I think this is still an unknown.  So I'm going to just say that I've not been told anything about when this will happen, except that it will be soon.  And I think even pointing to the watch maybe means it will be timely.  Are there any other implications of this report that we need to know?  I think that it does clearly show collusion.  I am seeing Putin there laughing, pulling a string.  It's exactly how he wanted it to go down.  First of all, it'll be just advertising for how great he is that he was able to infiltrate our system.  And second of all, it will undermine the American system knowing that he was very successful in his endeavor.  Now, again, before you get really angry at the situation, and that's totally okay if you do, but keep in mind, if this situation were reversed and this were Russia, Trump would already have taken over our nation.  All of these people would have been put in prison, like Rosenstein and Mueller.  We would not be here having this discussion.  We would be afraid and our newspapers would be being taken over.  so you know maybe he's laughing at it but you know he's that third grade petty bully.  um america does not um have to play by the bully's rules nor will it.  america's moving on and learning what it's like to have something like a dictatorship and how to avoid it.  so uh it will show and um It will show collusion with Russia.  And that really is a good thing.  Although there will be a lot of initial shakeups and people will get very upset and you'll see a real rise in this sort of, you know, kind of chaos.  Ultimately, we're just setting the cards out on the table and talking about what's really going on.  There is really proof of collusion in Mueller's work.  It shows that explicitly there won't be any question.  And that's the most important thing.  And on that note, thanks for watching. ",
