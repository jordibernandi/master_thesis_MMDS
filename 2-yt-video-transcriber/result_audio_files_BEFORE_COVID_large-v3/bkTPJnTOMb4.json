            "text": "Hello, friends.  I am a face that you probably don't have familiarity with.  My name is Mike Golay, and I am the Director of Operations at Behold Israel.  My brother-in-law, Amir, is actually on vacation somewhere in the world.  I don't want to tell you where because we respect his privacy, but we want to welcome you to the public reading of Scripture.  This is a vision that we've taken on over the last few months.  We want to bring the scriptures to you in a convenient time on a Sunday afternoon where you can sit back and you can go through the Bible with us.  Now, if you were here last week, we read Genesis chapter 1.  John 1 and Romans 1.  So obviously, we're going to pick up where we left off two weeks ago, and we're going to read Genesis 2, John 2, and Romans 2.  You see, a lot of people read the Bible, and a lot of people don't.  And it's for that crowd that we really are appealing to, those who don't really read the Bible.  Well, I have good news for you.  The Bible was designed to be read out loud in public situations.  And we are going to make that available to you so that you can just sit back and go through the Bible with us.  And we will be reading it to you out loud so that you can follow along with us.  And this is from Genesis chapter two.  And you can actually see if my drama in my style of reading is as dramatized as the actual dramatized Bible.  So let us read from Genesis chapter two.  Thus says, thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them.  And on the seventh day, God finished his work that he had done.  And he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.  So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it, God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.  These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.  In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.  When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not caused it to rain in the land, and there was no man to work the ground.  And a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground.  Then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.  And the man became a living creature.  And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east.  And there he put the man whom he had formed.  And out of the ground, the Lord God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.  The tree of life was in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four waters.  The name of the first is Pishon.  It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.  And the gold of that land is good.  The Delim and Ankh stone are there.  The name of the second river is Gihon.  It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.  And the name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria.  And the fourth river is the Euphrates.  The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and keep it.  And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat.  For in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die.  Then the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone.  I will make him a helper fit for him.  Now out of the ground, the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.  And whatever the man called every living creature, that was his name.  The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field.  But for Adam, there was not found a helper fit for him.  So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man.  And while he slept, he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.  And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man, he made into a woman and brought her to the man.  And then the man said, this at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.  She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.  Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife and they shall become one flesh.  And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.  So friends, that is the Genesis chapter 2 passage.  And even if I'm honest while I'm reading this, and I've read it many times, there's new things that come out or clarification pieces that perhaps I've never considered.  And that's really one of the goals of these public readings of Scripture.  So at this time, I am going to try and see if our John passage works because the real science of this is to use the audio dramatized Bible, which is one of the layers that we have in this program.  So without further ado, let's see if it works.  And I'm sure some of you will give me feedback if the audio didn't work like the last one.  So this is John's Gospel, Chapter 2.  So... You could see John's gospel, chapter 2, but you couldn't hear it.  So that means I'm going to read this to you as well, my friends.  Fortunately, I have it right here.  This is the wedding feast of Cana.  This is one of the more exciting stories, so forgive me if I get a little excited.  Here we go.  On the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee.  And the mother of Jesus was there.  Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples.  When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, they have no wine.  And Jesus said to her, woman, what does this have to do with me?  My hour has not yet come.  His mother said to the servants, do whatever he tells you.  Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification.  each holding 20 or 30 gallons.  Jesus said to the servants, fill the jars with water.  And they filled them up to the brim.  And he said to them, now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.  So they took it.  When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine and did not know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, everyone serves the good wine first.  And when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine.  But you have kept the good wine until now.  This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and manifested his glory.  And his disciples believed in him.  After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.  The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  In the temple, he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons and money changers sitting there.  And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple with the sheep and oxen.  And he poured out the coins of the money.  Changers overturned their tables.  He told those who sold the pigeons, Take these things away.  Do not make my father's house a house of trade.  His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for your house will consume me.  So the Jews said to him, What sign do you show us for doing these things?  Jesus answered him, answered them, destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.  The Jews then said, it has taken 46 years to build this temple and will you raise it up in three days?  But he was speaking about the temple of his body.  When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.  Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing.  But Jesus, on his part, did not entrust himself to them because he knew all people and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.  So my friends, we read Genesis chapter 2 and we read John chapter 2.  And the last passage we have here is Romans chapter 2.  And I hope that as we're reading these passages, you're garnering some of the meat of Scripture.  So let me try to see if the audio works on Romans 2.  And again, I'm counting on you to let me know if it doesn't.  And here we go. ",

            "text": "Romans 2.  Therefore, you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges.  For in passing judgment on another, you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.  We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.  Do you suppose, O man, you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?  Or do you presume on the riches of His kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?  But because of your hard and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.  He will render to each one according to his works.  To those who by patience and well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.  But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.  There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek.  But glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.  for god shows no partiality for all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.  for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.  For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.  They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.  But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God and know His will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law, and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth, you then, who teach others, Do you not teach yourself?  While you preach against stealing, do you steal?  You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?  You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?  You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law, for as it is written, The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.  For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law.  But if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.  So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?  Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision, but break the law.  For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.  But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the spirit, not by the letter.  His praise is not from man, but from God. ",

            "text": "Wow.  Apart from the technology, you have to admit that when you sit and listen to God's word, it's a different dynamic than reading it.  whether I'm reading it, whether somebody else is reading it, or a dramatized Bible like we were able to capture there in Romans, it really gives you truth, like a feeding of truth in your heart and in your soul.  Friends, in a moment I want to conclude, but there's some really key things that you need to understand, and that is we're going to be doing this regularly, and we're going to have a whole team that kind of presents this and allows all of us as a community worldwide to enjoy the Word of God.
