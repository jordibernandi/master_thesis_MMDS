            "text": "Good afternoon everyone.  Grand Solar Minimum Channel putting it out.  Imagine the impact next year.  We're already seeing empty shelves.  They're blaming poor harvests.  Walmart having difficulty.  Target showing shortages and it's not because of Hurricane Barry.  UK, Chatham Stores.  Ontario, again, oh, it's our distributors.  But don't worry, it'll get better.  Kenya with shortages.  Food banks now asking emergency relief supplies.  They're running out of food too.  And you know what?  Your hourly compensation for productivity is decreasing.  So what could possibly go wrong with this global supply chain?  And in my new book, along with my co-author Bill Porter, we talk about the exact same thing, the contraction of the economy, the lockup in the global supply chain, and the non-availability of the very same foods that you're seeing right now.  Climate revolution, the grand solar minimum.  Understand, prepare, adapt, and thrive.  The link's in the description box below this video.  Starting off here with the Grand Solar Minimum channel tweeting out, if last year's crop was bad, imagine this year's impact next year, meaning 2020.  If that 2018 crop, which was really, really good in comparison to what we have now, is creating these types of food price rises and shortages in canned vegetable scarcity, if you will, imagine next year.  So I'm going to wide out on that shot here.  Due to the poor harvest season we're experiencing, Wait a second.  They were using carryover stocks from last year's harvest to give you those cans right now.  There's no harvest right now.  The plants aren't at maturation.  So they're using last year 2018's supply and they're already running out.  We are at the lowest planting since 1938 in the United States.  And China lost 30% of its corn already as well.  So what's going to happen next year is going to be a thinning of the shelves.  And the global supply chain chains are dangerously easy to snap.  That's an understatement.  Everything is so reliant on easy flow of credit.  Now, if there's a credit lockup, as we experienced in 2008 and 2009, global supply chains are going to contract once again.  Case in point, the global food system.  Look at how many interconnected pieces there are.  Now imagine our economy drops 25 or 30% due to incredibly bad harvests and food prices doubling.  What's gonna happen in here?  What piece is gonna lock up first?  and then what's the trickle-down effect?  and where will that lock up next?  and where will the non-delivery be at the end of that chain?  This is exactly where the danger in such a fine-tuned, fully global food system shows itself.  Over here on the D.C.  clothes line, notice the date, February 6th.  This has been an ongoing event.  It's not something brand new.  that's just happening this month.  And I've purposely not chosen any store.  shelves from the Stormberry because you know every time there's a hurricane that the shelves are going to be empty.  These are empty shelves completely devoid of any natural disaster.  So why are we seeing so many bare shelves across grocery stores?  globally and across the country?  I'm going to say globally because I'm going to bring you here to Kenya.  Empty shelves depict a bleak future for Choppies supermarket.  The business news media in Kenya giving the citizens there, hey, the retailers owe the suppliers.  It's not really a shortage at all.  It's just it's a monetary thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It'll get straightened out eventually.  More resources will be devoted to the operation.  Don't worry about it.  Back to work.  And then what do we see here again?  Product shortages.  This comes from Walmart.  Due to limited availability, we are experiencing product shortages across this category.  We're working with our suppliers to get these items back as quickly as possible.  Well, you can't print food like you can print money, so good luck.  Wait another year and hope this grand solar minimum doesn't intensify.  Up into Ontario, empty store shelves, LCBO.  This is a bottle shop, liquor distributorship, along with different beverages.  Again, new warehouse management system to blame.  Oh, it'll get fixed, don't worry.  So everything that's involved using grains to distill spirits, wait a second, there's a shortage in that also?  I can see why they're rationing now the ethanol production in the United States before the shortages come in.  Please see one of our customer care service representatives for alternative recommendations, meaning you better go out and buy a lot of stuff for long-term food storage because, well, next year is going to be worse than this year.  If I were a customer service rep, I would tell you that.  Walmart Central Ohio?  Imagine that.  They're running out of flour, bread, wheat-based products.  Never would have thought of that.  Look at this, these are the instant noodles and different kind of boxed items, instant potatoes, pastas.  Gonna bring you over here to Target.  Whoa, what is happening with that?  What's up, Target?  This is an interesting one back in May as well.  So it's a progression.  I showed you that first article back in February and we got it in May, we got it in June, we got it in July.  And Root, thank you for calling out the pollinators being effected by different chemicals in our environment.  This is truly an extinction level event when we lose our pollinators and now nature is taking away our crops.  We can't hand pollinate enough to feed the planet.  Over to the UK.  No hurricane there.  Look at these empty shelves.  No trolleys.  Very lazy staff.  Either way, unacceptable.  Yeah, Monday.  Well, it's the supply chain.  Don't worry about it.  Back to work.  Night night.  Pay your taxes.  But one thing with the Winnipeg Harvest and different food banks feeding the homeless community, they're asking for your help.  They're running out of food too.  They're in dire need of canned stew, canned beans, fish, peanut butter, carbohydrates like pasta, rice, instant potatoes, mac and cheese.  Oh, wait a second.  Those are the same exact things I just showed you throughout the video that are unavailable.  You think it's a coincidence?  So now the trickle-down effect is going right to the bottom segment of the population.  And I told you from the beginning of the channel it's going to take about 10% to 15% of people at the lower strata of economic earnings in any country to go to the streets to disrupt the entire country.  Economically, when we see this, the police state is going to go into action.  They're going to have to control those people.  And I've been saying there's not enough police or army to control 30, 40 million people in the United States.  They're going to have to use frequency, 5G, et cetera, to control all of the unruly in the food riots.  Coming to a city near you, I'm going to drop the cherry right here on top of the cake.  Hourly compensation, green line.  Productivity, orange line.  You're priced out of the market.  Thanks for watching.  Hope you got something out of the video.  Speaking of long-term food storage, MyPatriotSupply just came out with the new grab-and-go food crate as well as the four-week bucket supply.  Both have a 25-year shelf life.  MyPatriotSupply.  Prepare with ADAPT 2030. ",
