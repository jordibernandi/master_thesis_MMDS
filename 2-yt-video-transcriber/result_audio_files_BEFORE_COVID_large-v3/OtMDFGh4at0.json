            "text": "You guys really need to work on your manners, your tolerance.  So this girl right here just tried to steal a hat from someone.  What brought you out here today?  Um, July 4th.  You guys approached me, looked like very excited to see me.  No.  Why'd you come over?  Bitch.  I'm sorry?  F*** you.  Oh, that's very tolerant and progressive.  Yeah.  You usually treat women you don't like like that?  Like, you just disagree with?  I actually turn the corners like that.  Why?  We're just humans.  Okay, well, you guys are awful humans.  Why?  We see all the s*** online.  We see all your s***, too.  Well, thank you for following me.  We don't follow you.  Oh, but you see everything that I tweet.  Yeah, because it's ignorant as f***.  Oh, so you guys are literally over here bragging about treating other women poorly.  No, we're treating Trump supporters poorly.  Why would you do that?  I thought it was love for everybody.  Everybody.  Quality.  You don't support love for everybody.  Yes, I do.  I would love you.  No, you don't love me.  Yes, I do.  Okay, I don't love you.  Alright, well that sucks because I'm sure we could be friends or something.  I don't want to be friends with you.  Why?  What do I support?  that's so wrong?  Trump.  The guns.  Do you guys think that women should be able to protect themselves from rapists?  Of course I do.  Yes.  Guns aren't necessary.  No.  Why?  If my rapist has a gun, shouldn't I have a gun?  Your rapist shouldn't have a gun.  No one should the f***ing have guns.  I shouldn't be able to defend myself.  Go ahead and defend yourself.  You can, yeah.  With no guns.  What can I use against a rapist or someone that wants to come and break into my home and murder me?  What am I supposed to get?  A knife.  A knife.  If they have a gun, because criminals don't follow laws, I'm just supposed to have a knife to protect me against a bullet?  Okay, well if there was no guns, your rapist wouldn't have a gun.  That's not how it works.  Drugs are illegal.  Okay, and people still do drugs, so why, like... That's a good point.  You just literally dissolved your own argument.  No, sis.  No, sis.  Sis, there it is.  Without fail, sis.  Alright, you guys really need to work on your manners, your tolerance.  F*** you.  F*** you.  F*** me.  F*** you.  F*** you.  you oh yeah so taller all right clown 2019 donald trump still your president.  i don't give a not for 2020 he's your president.  trump 2020 trump 2020 2020 2020. is it?  is it your land Are you?

Okay, I thought these were stolen lands.  We found out who stole them.  Whose streets?  Our streets!  Whose streets?  Our streets!  These are Trump streets.  Today, they're Trump streets.  Alright, circle Caitlyn Bennett if you're a huge fan.  Look at all these fans.  Look at all of these fans.  Guys, stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Whose streets?  Our streets!  Trump, you duck!  Very tolerant.  Michael!  What the fuck are you doing?  So this girl right here just tried to steal a hat from someone.  My hands are right in front of me.  No Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA!  No Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA!  Look what I did, look what I started.  No Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA!  I appreciate it.  You're welcome.  It's so funny because while they're complaining and being so intolerant, people were asking to take pictures with me.  Not them.  This is so unpopular.  This is so freaking weird how they act.  People want to take pictures with me because they know what a strong alpha female looks like.  Conservatism is winning in 2019.  Look at them.  Can you give me a big whistle?  You can do better than that.  Can I?  Right.  Progressive.  Progressive.  She's drowning Trump out.  Nobody's out here listening to him anymore.  Give me a really big whistle.  Yeah.  Wow!  Can you do better than that?  No, no, no, I can't.  Trump!  Very progressive.  Wow.  I love it.  Are you guys that progressive to say F Trump in the microphone?  What?  Are you that progressive?  To say F Trump in the microphone?  Like I just said F Trump.  F Trump!  What about, can you be more progressive than that?  Can I be more progressive?  How would I be more progressive than that?  You tell me.  You're the progressives.  You go.  You go.  Close the camps!  Yeah, I know.  Immigrants make America great.  Alright, we're going good here.  Can we go further than that?  What about Clown World?  What?  Clown what?  Clown World.  Clown World!  What about Orange Man Bad?  Orange Man Bad, yeah.  Okay, that's the top of the progressive list.  Alright, you guys, you got it.  You got it good.  a really big whistle.  no thank you.  oh why not?  why are you whistling not interested?  thank you so okay i figured out if i go up to them and ask them to give me a big whistle they'll just stop whistling and then everybody can hear trump like they want to.  isn't it kind of sad that you guys are outnumbered probably by 50 000 people?  Are you here to report or to editorialize?  Editorialize.  Oh, good.  No, I don't think so.  You're not outnumbered?  No, I don't think it's sad.  Okay.  Oh, it's not sad.  No, it's not that sad.
