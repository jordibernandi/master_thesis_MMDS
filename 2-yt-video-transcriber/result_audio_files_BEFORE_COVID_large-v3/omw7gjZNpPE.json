            "text": "Good Rising Brethren, this is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, give all praises to the Most High, Yehawah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yehawah Shai, a prayer to the Most High, blesses this lesson this evening.  Gives more knowledge and understanding of the events of the past, in order to understand the events that are currently happening on the Earth.  So it may get a much better understanding of the things that are soon to come on the earth.  We know that there has definitely been an energy switch.  The Most High is working feverishly to restore his people.  And what's amazing is to see how the nations are turning on one another.  It's like they were Confederate in our destruction, but now the Most High is turning them on one another.  And this True News channel had this discussion going on talking about Trump and how he assassinated the General Soleimani and how he went to a rally at an evangelical church.  And how they were pretty much just cheering along whatever Trump was saying.  And then how all of a sudden now this guy here on this channel was condemning these evangelicals for supporting the fact that Trump had assassinated this general.  But what you're going to hear right now is how these people are turning on the Israelis.  how they're saying that they're going back into the lands is not biblical.  Them being restored and elevated to a political power.  They're admitting to you that it is not biblical.  Now, what I find pretty interesting is this.  The Israelis or Ish has been in the promised land, as they say, for over 70 years.  But all of a sudden now, in 2020, you have all these so-called Christians coming out and now admitting the fact that their restoration by the Balfour Declaration had nothing to do with Bible prophecy.  Now, if they're going to admit all of a sudden that that has nothing to do with biblical prophecy, then what does?  So they never take that next step.  And you're going to see that right now as well.  It's one thing to, okay, now they're realizing that all these things, but they've used this whole thought process that if you help Israel, you'll be blessed.  If you curse Israel, you'll be cursed.  They've used that for decades to justify all their actions.  Now at the end, they're turning on one another.  You're trying to tell me that they didn't already know that before?  Why all of a sudden now in 2020 are these so-called Christians now telling the truth?  Now they're admitting the fact that none of that was part of prophecy.  None of the supporting-ish in the so-called Middle East has nothing to do with prophecy.  Did you think you'd ever hear that?  These Christians, so-called Christians, admitting the fact that all of these actions that they've been taking for the last few decades has absolutely nothing to do with prophecy.  Let's listen to a little bit.  Let's listen to a couple minutes here. ",

            "text": "Okay.  So, yes.  The kingdom of this land, the kingdom of this place was given to the Gentiles.  So he's correct as far as that's concerned.  But he goes on to a rant.  I'll leave the video link in the description box so you can check it out yourself.  But then he goes into a rant about, you know, that the Old Testament is done away and that we're in a new covenant and all this other stuff.  I'm not even going to waste my time on that.  But I thought this was very important for you guys to see.  how the Most High is turning them on one another.  All we're having to do is just sit back and watch them eat their own.  They were all definitely working together for a very long time and supporting the lie and keeping us at the bottom.  But now, as we said, we're going into a new phase, a new time, and the Most High is now using the Gentiles to tell on themselves, to admit the things that we've already been teaching.  and to admit the things that many Hebrews have already been teaching for a very long time.  How do you combat this?  They're not going to use scripture to substantiate anything that they've said.  All they're going to do is give you an opinion, which is what they've been doing the entire time.  Now, we all know that the Most High is going to reciprocate.  The Most High is going to raise his people up at the end.  See how he was really slick with saying, well, there's nothing in the New Testament scriptures.  Well, there's plenty of stuff in the New Testament, but we don't get to pick and choose which books.  They don't get to pick and choose which books we're going to look at anymore.  Mosiah said he was going to set us back into our rightful position right before their eyes.  Let me grab just a couple scriptures really quick.  Let's go to, let me go to.  Let me go to Psalms real quick.  Psalms 50.  This is going to be a real quick video.  There's no need to go into it because like I said, he pretty much told on themselves right there that there's no scriptures to substantiate the reemergence of the Israelites at the end because that was not scriptural at all.  It's not scriptural for the Israelites to be at the top of anything, to be in their lands, to be a political power, to have one of the strongest militaries.  That's not scriptural at all.  Let's see here.  Let's read Psalms 15 and start at 16.  But unto the wicked the Most High saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes?  Or if thou shouldst take my covenant in thy mouth?  Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.  See, they just made up their own endgame.  They made up their own narrative.  that has nothing to do with the Most High's plan.  When thou sawest a thief, did thou consentest with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.  Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.  Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother.  Thou slanderest thine own mother's sons.  And what you're seeing right now is the reproval.  The Most High is reproving these people.  The Most High is reproving these Gentiles.  He's showing them that all the things they've been teaching have been a lie.  And not only is he doing that, he's making them do it themselves.  He's making them destroy each other.  He's making them expose the lies that they've been pushing for all this time.  I want to read a little bit out of Baruch chapter four, because the most high is going to definitely recompense the world for what was done to us.  So this guy can kind of go off and make it sound like they're not going to have to pay or no one's going to have to pay.  And that everything's just, you know, as soon as Jesus came, everything's cool.  Okay.  The Most High said that they're going to have to pay.  Let's take a look here.  Baruch 4 and 23.  For us being sent out into when we were given to the hands of the other nations, just like he said, we're going to be given and we're going to be at the bottom.  And then the Most High was going to give us to the other nations, just like he said in Nephi 13.  This is Baruch 4 and start 23.  For I sent you out with mourning and weeping, but the Most High will give you to me again with joy and gladness forever.  Like as now the neighbors of Zion have seen your captivity, so shall they see shortly your salvation from our power, which shall come upon you with great glory and brightness of the everlasting.  My children, suffer patiently the wrath that has come upon you from the Most High, for thine enemy hath persecuted thee.  But shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck.  This is what's been happening to our people, all in the hopes of, in the near future, being restored.  26.  My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock.  caught of the enemies.  Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto the Multai, for ye shall be remembered of him, and brought these things upon you.  Well, he said, that brought these things upon you.  For as it was your mind to go astray from the Multai, so being returned, seek him ten times more.  For he hath brought these plagues upon you, shall bring you everlasting  joy.\"  again with your salvation.  Take a good heart, O Jerusalem, for he that gave thee the name will comfort thee.  Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall.  Miserable are the cities which thy children served.  Miserable is she that received thy sons.  For she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall.  So shall she be grieved for her home desolation.  So just like he wants to make it sound like, you know, there's nothing that talks about retribution.  There's retribution all over the place.  The last one I'm going to read is from 2 Baruch 13.  We're going to read a little bit from 2 Baruch 13, verse 4.  So that if ever those prosperous cities say, why has Elohim brought upon us this retribution?  Say unto them, you and those like you who shall have seen this evil, this is the evil and retribution which is coming upon you and upon your people in its destined time, that the nations may be thoroughly smitten, and then they shall be in anguish.  And if they say at that time for how long, you will say to them, ye who have drunk the strained wine, drink ye also of its dregs, the judgment of the lofty one who has no respect of persons.  On this account he had aforetime no mercy on his own sons, but afflicted them as his enemies, because they sinned.  Then therefore were they chastened, that they might be sanctified.  But now, ye peoples and nations, ye are guilty, because ye have always trodden down the earth, and used the creation unrighteously.  For I have always benefited you.  And ye have always been ungrateful for the beneficence.  And so, like we said, the Most High is now turning them on one another.  Saying, don't look at me.  Look at what they're doing.  Look at what they're doing.  They're morally bankrupt.  You've all been morally bankrupt.  And you're still morally bankrupt because you're not admitting the full truth.  All praises to the Most High, Yahuwah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yahushua.  Shalom. ",
