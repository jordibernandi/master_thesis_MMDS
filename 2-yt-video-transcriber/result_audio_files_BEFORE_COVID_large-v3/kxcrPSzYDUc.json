            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special Salvation Update from Ashkelon, Israel.  We're living in prophetic times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  Jews and Arabs are being saved in Israel like never before.  Glory to Yeshua, Jesus, God.  Psalms 34 verse 20.  He protects all his bones.  Not one of them will be broken.  John chapter 19 verse 36.  Now these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled.  Not one of his bones will be broken.  As believers in Yeshua, in Jesus, we understand that this was fulfilled by the King of kings and Lord of lords, Jesus Yeshua.  But for Jews who do not believe in Yeshua, who do not believe that he is the only way to salvation, for them, they don't read these Bible passages.  They're called the forbidden chapters.  Messiah of Israel Ministries has been preaching all through the land of Israel.  Psalms 34 verse 20.  He protects all his bones.  Not one of them will be broken.  Asking the people, who is this referring to?  Many were shocked to even see that it's in the word of God.  Others got upset.  Many were fascinated and wanted to see the written word of God.  Praise Yeshua.  We began to launch one of our outreaches in Ashkelon, Israel, asking the people, who is this speaking about in Psalms 34 verse 20?  Who is the one that not one bone will be broken?  As I was sharing, I noticed one of the main rabbis of Ashkelon, Rabbi Yitzhak Kleisman, walking.  He is a very known rabbi in Israel.  I introduced myself and asked him, Are you Rabbi Yitzchak Kleisman?  He said, Yes.  May I ask you a question?  Being one of the main rabbis of Israel, he was very happy and said, Yes.  I turned the Bible to Psalms 34 verse 20 and read with him in Hebrew.  He protects all his bones.  Not one of them will be broken.  I asked Rabbi Yitzchak Kleisman, Mize, who is this speaking about?  that his bones will not be broken?  Immediately the smile on Kleisman's face disappeared.  He was at a loss of words.  The Holy Spirit was working on him.  Suddenly he said, It's referring to King David.  I then told Rabbi Kleisman, According to the context, it cannot be King David.  Let's turn back a few verses and start reading from Psalms 34, verse 18.  I began to read with Rabbi Kleismann.  The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.  He saves those who are crushed in spirit.  I asked Rabbi Kleismann, is King David the Lord?  He said, no.  Does King David save those who are crushed in spirit?  He said, no.  So I said already by your own testimony, the context cannot be King David.  Verse 19.  The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all.  He protects all his bones.  Not one of them will be broken.  So we can see here that no one can be righteous, but only through the Lord who delivers him.  And the one that delivered is the one that not one of his bones will be broken.  At that moment, Rabbi Kleismann said, it's a little bit difficult for me to continue to stand here.  I need to go.  I then turned to Rabbi Kleisman and said, there's a park right here.  Maybe we can sit down in the shade and study the word of God.  Praise Yeshua, Jesus, God.  Rabbi Kleisman agreed.  And we went to sit in the park to study the word of God together.  I began to read with Rabbi Yitzchak.  When we arrived to Psalms 22 verse 14, the rabbi started to get very nervous.  Verse 15.  Verse 15.  For dogs surround me, a band of evil men encircles me.  They have pierced my hands and my feet.  I can count all my bones.  My enemies stare at me and gloat.  I turned to the rabbi and said, This is speaking about the Messiah who died on the cross for your sins, rose on the third day.  And by his blood, if you repent and believe, you have full redemption of sins and eternal life.  This is what it's speaking about, that not one of his bones will be broken.  As it says here in Psalms 22, verse 17, I can count all my bones.  My enemies stare at me and gloat.  Rabbi Kleismann's reaction was, this is impossible.  I told Rabbi Glazman, you're right, it is impossible because it's supernatural.  He says, but Jews don't believe this.  I said, are you not looking at a Jewish Bible?  He said, yes.  Is it not written by King David under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit?  He said, yes.  I then asked the rabbi, have you heard of Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri?  Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri.  Rabbi Glazman said, not only do I know who Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri is, But I studied under his teachings for many years.  I then pulled out the book, The Rabbi, The Secret Message, and The Identity of the Messiah.  Kleismann asked, Is this one of Rabbi Kaduri's books?  I said, It's a book about Rabbi Kaduri, his life, and the revelation that he received of the Messiah.  Kleismann was now fascinated.  He wanted to see the book.  We began to read many pages in the book.  Finally reached the page.  of the note in Hebrew that Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri left in a decoded format that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Rabbi Kleismann was staring at the book over and over again, bringing it close to his face.  He couldn't believe his own eyes.  He recognized the handwriting being of Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri.  He then asked me, I'm one of the main rabbis of Ashkelon.  How is it?  I never heard about this?  I then told Rabbi Kleismann, many have not heard about this because the rabbinic movement in israel the sanhedrin the rabbi the rabbinical courts have done everything they can to suppress the truth to hide the truth and the fact of the matter is this book.  they did not want to reach to israel but we're doing everything we can to spread the truth so that rabbis like you and other people would see that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  And the greatest rabbi that ever lived in Israel, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri left a note.  With that revelation, Yitzchak Adori understood who the one is that the bones shall not be broken.  At that moment, something supernatural happened.  Rabbi Kleisman wanted to see more Bible passages.  This rabbi that was in a hurry was now sitting together with me in a park in Ashkelon and studying the word of God for hours.  I then told Rabbi Yitzhak Kleisman, now you understand why these Bible passages are called the forbidden passage.  Because if you read them, the power of the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to the revelation that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  This is why you and other rabbis have been teaching to read Bible interpretations and not directly the Word of God.  But today is your supernatural day of salvation.  king solomon the wisest of all men writes the conclusion in ecclesiastics chapter twelve verse twelve and thirteen.  be warned my son of anything in addition to them of making of many books.  there is no end and much study wearies the body.  Now all has been heard.  This is the conclusion of the matter.  Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind.  And in Hebrew, the word commandments is the word Torah, which means God's instructions from Genesis to Revelation.  Something happened at that moment.  The rabbi began to tremble.  I asked the rabbi, do you want to accept Yeshua, Jesus, as your personal Savior?  He said yes.  Rabbi Yitzhak Kleisman stood up and confessed Jesus, Yeshua, as Lord and Savior of his life.  He repented from his sins.  This is a supernatural event.  We give all the glory to Jesus Yeshua.  Let's pray for Rabbi Kleismann.  It's not easy for any Jew to accept Yeshua as the Messiah, but especially if you're one of the main rabbis.  Let's pray that he'll have the strength and the power through the Holy Spirit to overcome persecution and to preach the gospel to his students and to his family.  We will now be meeting Rabbi Kleismann for Bible study.  Let's continue to pray for all those who heard the gospel and for our new brother in Yeshua, Rabbi Yitzchak Leisman.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, reporting from Ashkelon, Israel, in the mighty name of Al Yehuda, the line of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, Amen.  Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has died aged eight.  We are with one of Rabbi Kadouri's disciples.  Thank you.  It's a great blessing.  It's a great and fast blessing.  And in the Bible, it says, ",
