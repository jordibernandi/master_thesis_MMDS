You do know that Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark rank higher than the United States.  They have more economic freedom.  That is not socialist.  That is capitalist.  In many ways, the Scandinavian countries are more capitalistic than we are.  Where they're not is universal health care, or they give out a bunch of stuff.  I don't want to live in a country of a 70% tax rate.  But as far as you rank the economic freedom index, they're much higher.  So you would support the deregulation of the economy, the repealing of Dodd-Frank, the lowering of small business taxes, the abolition of the FICA tax.  You would support all these things, which are inherently anti-socialist, inherently anti-Democrat.  Would you support those things? ",
