            "text": "Hey everybody, Shawn here with Revealing Truth, where we look at what people are saying the Bible says, and then compare it to what the Bible actually says.  Now as I said in my last video, I believe Michael Brown has a lot of correct teachings.  He's a very educated man, even if he is a bit slick with his answers to avoid showing allegiance to any one Christian theology.  but what he said in this clip floored me and i gotta say that maybe he's not as educated as i thought.  so let's get into it.  we're all familiar with matthew 7 21-23 where jesus said not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father in heaven.  Many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?  Then I will tell them plainly, I never knew you.  Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.  Now, a girl asks what this means at one of his Q&A meetings, and I can't believe the answer.  Check this out. ",

            "text": "Hello.  Hello.  My question's not like really well put together, but so basically I don't even know the scripture word for word, but it's when it's a parable that Jesus gives.  and he says... You know, many will come to me saying, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name?  Did we not cast out demons in your name?  And then, et cetera.  And then Jesus says, oh, get away from me.  You who practice evil, I never knew you.  So could you elaborate a little bit on that? ",

            "text": "Sure.  Yeah, so it's in Matthew, the seventh chapter, and starting in verse 21, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father.  And then it continues, the next verse is, many will say to me on that day, Lord, haven't we prophesied in your name, in your name, driven out demons, done many mighty works?  And he'll say, I never knew you.  Depart from me, you workers.  of lawlessness or iniquity.  So how does that work?  There are a couple of different ways to read it. ",

            "text": "No, Michael, this is to be read one way with one understanding.  And I just want to mention that this is so typical of Brown to give a couple of views, explain them, but then not say which one he really supports and therefore keeps himself safe when others criticize his teachings.  But in this one, he's going to tell us what the better way to look at this verse is. ",

            "text": "But the most logical way to read it is to read it in first century Jewish terms where I never knew you was a formula for excommunication.  In other words, it's not saying we never had a relationship.  It's saying, away from me.  So that they once were used by God, but they ceased living for God and doing the will of God.  So yes, they were used in miracles and things like that, like Judas Iscariot.  From what we know, presumably he drove out demons, healed the sick, but betrayed the Lord and went to a place of judgment. ",

So those words did carry that meaning and that context in first century Jewish thought.  Or it could be referring to counterfeit miracle workers, corrupt preachers, things like that, who were just in it for greedy gain and who maybe God worked miracles through the word in spite of it. ",

            "text": "and once again at the end he says it could be one way or the other but we heard him say the best way was meaning that jesus knew them but they backslid and jesus excommunicated them.  this is so wrong and i think we all agree on that.  i've never heard anyone teach these verses like that.  so let's look at what the greek says.  The first word we'll look at is never, which in Greek is eudepote, and we can see here that never means never, never ever.  And on the right you can see other Bible verses that support this.  The second word we'll look at is new, which in Greek is gynoseko, and it's very clear from its use here that it means to have a personal and intimate relationship with.  So this verse is not saying that these people were once believers that Jesus knew and that he excommunicated them.  It's saying that these were people that Jesus never ever had an intimate and personal relationship with.  And isn't it interesting that the things they are claiming to do are prophecy, which NAR teaches that people can do and be right only 10% of the time, and also casting out demons, where we see people like Torben Sondergaard casting demons out from people when they're just getting baptized, and let's not forget, miracles, you know, like making legs grow.  I believe that these are the people Jesus will be saying, you may have known who I was, but I never knew you.  What do you think?
