            "text": "okay.  so i'm busy with an energetic recently walking 13 month old and can barely shower on a good day let alone make a youtube video but i can't sit by idly while i watch the cbc exploit and sexualize children.  so here we go.  canada's public as in taxpayer funded broadcaster decided it was a great idea to tweet this.  what it's like to be a kid.  drag queen At CBC Kids News spoke with the four stars of CBC's new Drag Kids documentary to find out what drag is and why they do it.  Welcome to Hellworld.  And no, your eyes aren't deceiving you.  They tweeted it from the CBC Kids News account.  You know, the one whose motto is real news delivered by real kids.  A little sidebar, last year I did a story on the CBC kids news program and I said the plan is to weaponize these kids into lefty news soldiers.  and right from the first episode they were indoctrinating children on gender theory and LGBTQ trans stuff.  And now they're airing a drag kid documentary.  How's that slippery slope?  I'm not going to play the entire video because I don't want you to have to endure this demented promo.  It literally made my stomach turn.  Please, someone tell me, what purpose does this serve?  We are paying for this obscene doc after all.  We have a right to know how this programming is appropriate for children.  Who is going to watch this besides some very sick individuals?  And how is this not sexualizing kids?  You've got a child gyrating with booty shorts on.  If this was a little girl, lefties would be up in arms.  Remember the outrage over toddlers in tiaras?  But this is perfectly acceptable because it's a bunch of young boys, huh?  And for the network that preaches diversity 24-7, the lineup of kids isn't exactly multi-culti.  Where's the Arab Muslim trans kid?  Or the Indian trans boy?  or the Orthodox Jewish trans kid.  I mean, this isn't exactly a stretch for Afghanis, where child sex slavery is rampant.  I mean, they even have a name for it.  It's called bacha bazi.  But to see this sort of practice being aired on public TV by Canada's national broadcaster is absolutely despicable.  Children need to be protected, not thrown to the wolves.  How is this not child abuse on behalf of the parents?  What kind of adult puts their young, vulnerable, and trusting son on display in this manner?  As a mother myself, this makes me ill.  This is child exploitation.  They're being paraded out for attention, likely by their sicko mothers that have Munchausen's by proxy.  Living in clown world, we're seeing drag kids everywhere.  From RuPaul's Drag Show to that 11-year-old Desmond is Amazing.  Drag queens are even selling cookies to children.  Remember Chips Ahoy on Mother's Day?  I'm so sick of this shit, honestly.  Let's call it what it really is.  Grooming under the guise of tolerance.  And naive people who want to virtue signal their moral superiority are falling for it hook, line, and sinker.  Don't believe me?  Then why are so many of these storytime drag queens pedophiles with criminal histories of sexually abusing children?  Confusing kids about gender isn't healthy.  Is this doc going to discuss how many children regret sexual reassignment surgery after they undergo it?  Or how about the high level of mental illness and suicide in the trans community?  Manipulating kids whose brains are not developed enough to understand the implications of hormone injections or to disseminate concepts like gender fluidity is disgusting.  And to have Canada's public broadcaster at the forefront of it is criminal.  If we cannot protect our children, what is even the point for the West to exist?  I don't know about you, but I don't want to be part of a society that allows and promotes this degradation.  Using our tax dollars to push this degenerate agenda is evil.  Time for the CBC to be defunded now and the higher ups who okayed this program fired immediately.  And for the people out there who call me a fascist or a homophobe or transphobe for not accepting drag kids, you know the types, let him express himself.  He's not hurting anyone.  He's having fun.  Well, I don't give a shit.  I will never back down on this issue.  What is happening to these kids is beyond wrong.  It's satanic.  The CBC is out of its mind airing this stuff and allowing innocent children to be exploited.  Desmond is Amazing's mother just recently complained about pedophiles sexualizing her son.  Like you didn't see this coming, lady.  Your child was videotaped dressed as Gwen Stefani taking money on a stage at a gay club.  What did you think was going to happen?  He also appeared in a YouTube video with convicted killer Michael Alling talking about ketamine and with a Rohypnol painting behind him.  You know the date.  rape drug?  Who knows what has happened to Desmond?  It is tragic.  And yet the mother doesn't get charged with child abuse.  And she continues to parade her victim son around like a show pony.  And the mainstream media eats it up.  Anyways, a white pill here is how many Canadians feel the same rage I do over this documentary.  Take a look at that Twitter ratio in the comments.  They just keep going and going and going and going.  Maybe there's hope for Canadians after all.  Normal, healthy-minded people who genuinely care about children's well-being are rejecting drag kids en masse.  It's about time.  Let me know in the comment section below what you think about all of this and thank you so much for liking and subscribing.  Talk to you soon and have a great day. ",
