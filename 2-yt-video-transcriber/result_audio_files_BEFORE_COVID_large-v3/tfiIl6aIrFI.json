            "text": "All esteem to the most high Elohim.  This is your brother El.  Let's go to Mark chapter 13, verse 13.  Listen to these words.  But he that shall endure until the end, the same shall be saved.  I love those verses of scripture.  And this is what I'm always reminding myself of.  And this is what I'm always reminding our brothers and sisters about, that this walk is all about endurance.  This walk is a marathon.  This life that we live is a marathon.  It's about endurance.  You would not believe how many people just in my years of being in this walk that I've seen them come and I've seen them go.  It's not that they passed away or anything like that, but so many of them begin this walk.  They start out excited about keeping the commands.  They start out excited about finding out who they are as the people of the most high.  They start out excited studying all these extra books and lost books and getting into the scriptures and fasting and praying and keeping the feast days and connecting with other brothers and sisters.  But somewhere along the line, Many of them fall by the wayside because they did not have the endurance.  This walk is about that endurance.  It's a marathon.  The marathon continues, as the brother Nipsey would say.  This walk, according to the Messiah, is all about endurance.  What does he say here in Mark chapter 13, verse 13?  He says, but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  We got to be able to endure through all the distractions that's going on, even amongst our people.  We got to be able to endure even those times we fall short of the most highest glory.  to still do like the scripture say that a righteous man may fall down seven times, but he will rise again and endure.  We have to continue to endure and always keep these verses on our mind.  Mark chapter 13, verse 13, but he that shall endure until the end, the same shall be saved.  The marathon continues.  We must endure the marathon to make it to the kingdom.  the marathon to endure, to inherit salvation, the marathon to overcome all things so that our name can be written in the Lamb's book of life.  We must endure, because I'm going to read this verse again until it sinks deep in our mind and in our soul and in our spirit.  But he that shall endure until the end, the same shall be saved.  Focus on enduring above all things.  Focused on keep going above all things.  Focus on maintaining your zeal above all things.  Endure.  Listen to what it says here in the second book of Ezra's second Ezra's chapter seven, starting at verse 57.  It says, and the most high answered me and said, this is the meaning of the battle that every man born on earth must fight.  That if he is beaten, he will suffer what you have said.  But if he is victorious, he will receive what I say.  Those scriptures right there in 2nd Ezra 7 and 57 connect perfectly with what we just read in Mark 13, 13.  It's all talking about endurance.  And those scriptures there in 2nd Ezra are saying that this life, this existence and what we dealing with, this is the battle that every man born on earth must fight.  Everybody got to face this.  even the more so the righteous who are on that narrow road to the kingdom, even the more so, do they face this?  Because the scripture says, many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Most High delivers out of them all.  And how does he deliver the righteous?  When they endure.  But he that shall endure until the end, the same shall be saved.  And one thing I can tell you about endurance In my time on this earth and in my time in my walk with the Most High, we must never get a mentality that we've already arrived.  Whenever you're enduring, whenever you run in a marathon, you have not arrived until you've arrived.  You have not crossed that checkered flag and crossed that finish line until you cross that finish line.  And we have not arrived until we make it to that kingdom.  You know, I have to say that because there's so many brothers and sisters that they talk about when we get to the kingdom, we're going to do this.  When I get to the kingdom, I'm going to do that.  Family, first, let's make it there.  Because what did the Messiah say?  There be many that want to make it into the kingdom, but will not.  What did father Abraham say?  Whenever the most high showed him a vision of the day of judgment, father Abraham wrote in the Testament of Abraham.  He said that when he was shown judgment day, that out of every 7,000 souls, scarcely was there found one that was saved out of every 7,000.  I wonder why the numbers will be so few for the same reason.  It was few in the days of Noah.  Folk didn't have no endurance.  They got excited for a short period of time about the information that they was receiving and they put it in practice for a short time and then they light got extinguished.  Whatever it was that caused their light to get extinguished, they no longer have that zeal and that drive to endure.  Those are the ones you see falling by the wayside on this walk.  And if you in the walk long enough, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.  I'm telling you, man, they come and they go on this walk.  But once again, this is the battle that every man born on earth must fight.  But he that shall endure until the end, the same shall be saved.  Check out these verses in second Ezra's chapter eight, starting at verse 46.  And then I'm going to be out of here.  It says, And the Most High answered me and said, The present is for those who are now, and the future for those who shall be.  For you are far from able to love what I have created more than I, but you have often counted yourself among the ungodly.  Never.  But for this, you will be commended before the Most High because you humbled yourself as was fitting and did not count yourself among the upright so as to glorify yourself too much.  What was going on here in this conversation is that the Most High was commending the prophet Ezra because Ezra was so humble that he didn't automatically say, place himself among the righteous.  He was so humble and meek that he looked upon himself as if he wasn't even going to make it.  Even though the father was speaking to him and sharing with him all these wonderful things, he still looked upon himself humbly and said, only by the grace of the most high will I make it in.  Ezra was one of the most righteous men to walk the earth.  Yet he even was looking at himself like, I'm nothing but a defiled, wicked sinner.  I'm nothing but a bag of dust.  I'm nothing but a slave of the Most High.  Only by his mercy will I make it into that kingdom.  That's how Ezra was looking at himself.  Much like the parable of the Messiah when he spoke about the Pharisee and the tax collector.  That whenever the tax collector went in there to pray, he said, I'm a sinner.  Most High have mercy on me, a sinner.  But the Pharisee went in there saying, I fast three times a day.  I know I'm Israel.  I got I got my fringes.  I speak the Hebrew language.  And for those of you who know that parable, we know who was justified more than the other one.  So I'm telling you, family, this is a marathon.  Don't be out here acting as if you are already in.  Because we got to get that green light from the Father before we make it in that kingdom.  That's why the best thing to do is to endure.  Endure.  Because this is the battle that every man born on earth must fight.  But he that shall endure until the end, the same shall be saved.  Let's continue to read these verses here in second Ezra's chapter eight.  It says for those who inhabit the world in the last times will be afflicted with many great miseries because they have walked in great pride.  But you must think of yourself and ask about the glory of those who are like yourself, for it is for you that paradise has opened.  The tree of life is planted.  The age to come is prepared.  Plenty is provided.  A city is built.  A rest is ordained and good deeds completed.  Wisdom perfected beforehand.  The root of evil is sealed up from you.  For you, sickness is extinct and death has departed.  Hades has fled and corruption has gone into oblivion.  Sorrows have passed away and the treasure of immortality is finally displayed.  What the Most High is doing there is reminding Ezra of why he is enduring.  Those are the things that we have to keep in mind as well, brothers and sisters, to endure, to endure.  Philippians chapter three, verse 11.  The apostle Paul also said it beautifully about this marathon of endurance.  It says, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, not as though I had already attained either were already perfect.  But I follow after.  if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Messiah.  Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward unto those things which are before.  I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of the Most High in the Messiah.  Beautifully spoken.  So what Paul is saying is that he knows he has not arrived.  So he's going to continue to reach.  He's going to continue to endure.  He's going to continue to move forward.  In other words, the marathon continues.  We must keep going.  This is the battle that every man born on earth must fight.  You and I, we have to endure so we can be that one out of 7,000 that makes it into the father's kingdom.  Endure.  Keep that word in your mind, family.  Endure.  Even through all the nonsense that's going on, endure.  Even working through the confusion of your own mind, so many unanswered questions, endure.  The marathon continues.  Hallelujah.  Just wanted to come in here and speak those words.  I really feel like there's folk that needed to hear that.  So let those words sink deep into your heart.  Before I go, just want to remind brothers and sisters of the works of the ministry.  We have the 613 laws of Torah audio book, which is out now.  that is narrated by myself.  That is an audio book that is five hours long where we are narrating all the laws and commands of Torah.  No other commentary, no other extra stuff.  Just the law, law, law, all 613 laws and commands of Torah.  And in the audio book, we also give the scriptures of where you can find those laws and read them for yourself.  The scripture says in Joshua chapter one, verse seven and eight, that we are commanded to meditate on the laws and commands of Torah.  So this project, by putting it in your hands, you are literally keeping the law in command to meditate on the law day and night.  This is an audio book that you can download into your phone, your computer.  You can listen to it while you're in your car.  You can listen to it while you're working out.  You can listen to it while you're at work.  You can listen to it while you're in the kitchen cooking.  You can listen to it on Shabbat and use it for your Shabbat study.  You can listen to it at all times.  The scripture says that faith come by hearing.  So the more you hear those laws and commands, the more it gets written on your heart and the more motivated you are to obey what the father has to say.  I'm going to put the link in the description box where you can find that project, the 613 laws of Torah.  You can also find it on Amazon audible and you can also find it on Amazon.  Apple iTunes.  Just go to Google, type in 613 Laws of Torah audiobook by Brother L, and it'll show up, I assure you.  Check it out.  Another project we have is the Words of the Most High Father audiobook.  That is a 14-hour audiobook also narrated by myself.  where we go through all the words that the father spoke all the way from Genesis, where he said, let there be light all the way to the new Testament, where he told his son, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.  Listen to him.  That project was inspired because in so many of the Bibles, they have the words of the Messiah emphasized in red.  And that's cool, that's beautiful.  We need to hear the words of the Messiah.  But the Messiah, when he was here, always pointed to the Father as the one he followed.  So even the more so, if the Father is even above the Son, We need to also be listening to what the father had to say.  So that is what inspired that audio book.  Like I said, it's a 14 hour audio book with all the words that the most high spoke out of his own mouth and through the word and through the prophets.  I'll put the link in the description box where you can invest in that project and own it for yourself.  We also have the words of the Messiah audio book.  Cause the Messiah is the Torah in the flesh.  The father spoke through the Messiah.  They are one.  So how could we not have an audio book of the words of the Messiah as well?  So we have the words of the Messiah audio book, which is a four hour audio book.  The words and interactions and parables of the Messiah spoken from Matthew to John.  That is in that audio book.  It is also narrated by myself.  I'll put the link in the description box where you can find that by picking up all three of those projects.  You really truly are enriching your walk with the most time and you are putting tools in your hands.  that will sharpen you and give you strength to endure on this walk if you truly get immersed in those projects and feed off of them and apply the wisdom of the torah the messiah and the father in your life.  so check those out.  also Check out the brother over there doing great things for our people over there at HI Fashion Store, Hebrew Israelite Fashion Store.

Only by the father's strength have we made it thus far.  And we thank the father for using lowly.  sinners, and those like myself who are but dust that the father has breathed the breath of life into to speak these words that I would sincerely hope are helping you in your walk so that you would be even more motivated to endure.  Before I go, I'm going to leave you with these verses again.  Mark 13, 13.  But he that shall endure until the end shall be saved.  The marathon continues.  Keep going, family.  Shalom. ",
