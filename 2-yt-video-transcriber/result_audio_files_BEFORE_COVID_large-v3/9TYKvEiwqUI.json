I might need to take him to the dermatologist, but listen, I need to be serious for a second.  Can I do that?  Is that okay?  I'm going to put on my serious party sunglasses.  These are prescription party sunglasses.  So anyhow, guys, look, I think what we're doing here is this.  I think at some point down the road, we are going to be bringing the Creationist Cat Channel to sort of a series finale.  And now look, that really shouldn't be a bummer.  But for those who feel a little bummed, just come here.  Come on. ",

And so this channel is going to go on, just as it always has, but with me and CC and company.  will pop up from time to time, so don't worry about that.  Now, this is the important part, guys, so please, please, please stick around.  Basically, we're going to be doing this one of two ways, and either is fine with me, but the second of the two is way more awesome, at least I think.  We're either going to wrap things up in just a few videos, or with your help through Patreon, we can give CC a truly great send-off with an extended Creationist Cat season finale.  And if you guys are wondering, hey, what's that?  Well, I'll tell you right now, it's pretty simple. ",

Oh god, this is really hard to watch.  The fuck is he doing?  Oh boy, I don't think I'll ever be able to unsee this.  Oh, nope, nope, nope.  Okay, there's a slight chance he might need to die.  But, uh, look guys, here's the deal.  If you want to see an extended CC series finale featuring me, racing this cat, before this channel gets handed over to ThoughtScibe's long-lost brother over here, who very well might need an exorcist, uh, kids, you may not want to try this at home.  But, uh, anyhow, if we get our Patreon to at least $1,200 a video, you'll get several more months of me.  We'll stretch it at least into the first few months of 2020.  Let's face it, you need this.  The world needs this.  The internet needs this.  Don't you, internet?  YSCC, I do believe I would find that highly enjoyable.  Folks, we're pretty close to our goal as it is.  Only you can make this happen.  And I guess a few other people on top of that will be necessary to make it happen.  I'm really starting to lose faith that Vadim can make that happen.  But anyhow, you made me wondering... The extended creationist cat series finale?  What the freak is that about?  Well, please allow one of the greatest minds of our time, who happens to be me, explain.  Shadowbites, if we reach our freaking goal of just $1,200 a freaking video, we're actually not that far away from it.  We can do this.  You amazing peeps will get at least one or two more episodes of all our beloved freaking creationist cat segments.  I'm talking at the freaking movies.  Twitter Blitz.  Creationist Cat responds to your stupid bullshit.  Which, you know, we haven't done in a while.  I'm personally excited to respond to your stupid bullshit again.  And Creationist Cat Chats.  Perhaps we could even get Sam Sheeter if he stops being such a freaking coward. ",

Who the fuck knows, some other shit might happen!  People, don't forget, even a freakin' dollar a video or a month really helps!  I'm the Lord's chosen cat.  Will I have the Lord's chosen extended series finale?  Personally, I think that would be great.
