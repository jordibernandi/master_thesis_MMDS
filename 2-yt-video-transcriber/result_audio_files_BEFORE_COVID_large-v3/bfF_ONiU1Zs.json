            "text": "If you've been watching my channel, you've probably seen me filming some pretty interesting footage.  Can you name three things women are better at than men?  They're better at enduring pain.  What are you doing to women that you know that?  What's going on in your dungeon?  What exactly do you believe in?  You're asking a lot of hard questions this Friday.  liberation for black brown queer disabled people.  it's really important to me but i don't want you to get the impression that everyone i'm meeting out there is angry we're talking to people on streets or crazy or delusional.  oh yeah women don't necessarily have to have vaginas And I don't want you guys losing hope, you know, thinking that the cause was lost.  That's it.  Us men have to be single forever.  No poom poom for us.  Truth is, we have really amazing, loving, caring, fantastic girls out there.  Yeah, check out this one interview for an example.  Basically, we're here at Starbucks, and we met a woman who isn't a feminist, who thinks it's stupid, so we just want to get her real quick to see what she thinks.  Hello.  They asked me what I think about this, and I think... that sexism has been completely blown out of proportion, and I think that it is actually the other way around when people say they are treating women, you know, special and different than them.  I mean, that's... So I just think it's weird.  I don't want to be hired because, well, it's kind of convenient for me.  But for all these simple things, I think that people are getting hired You know, because they're women, they need me in tech.  I'm in a tech job, and I'm just going to spend as little as possible because I'm a woman, and not because I'm good at what I do.  And then you're not hiring people who are specialists.  Thank you.  So, I just think, you know, that generally.  It's just perfection and all sorts of things.  But feminists are special.  Look at that.  Unbelievable.  You see?  That girl was cool.  You'd hang with her, right?  She could be one of your bros, sis, sis, sis, bros, bros, sis.  That's another video.  But she was cool.  And, you know, I just want to share also, like, just a story.  Just a story.  Because there's this, like, belief going around that in the Western cultures, you know, I mean, they're really after your money and it's all about your job and your status and blah, blah, blah, blah.  And also, obviously, you know, men are being abused in many, many other areas can be messy out there.  But as that's all going on, there still continue to be absolutely wonderful, beautiful women out there who don't want your money or your status or your car or half your shit in a divorce or just beautiful beings.  You know, really?  They're out there, guys.  And I just want to share one story.  Just one story.  So I have lots of stories about women who are just super cool.  And I feel like they're not out there.  Like no one's out there just being like, women are awesome.  But they are.  So I just want to put some of those.  I want to put more.  women are great stories out because they're so wonderful.  So here's a story about just women being great.  Just to add a little love to it.  There was this beautiful girl I was dating once.  I don't know if I should say her name.  It's not an uncommon name.  Her name was Maria.  And basically, it was our third date, and it was going to be the first time we were going to hook up.  She came over.  She made dinner.  It was obvious that it was happening.  And it was a great time.  The whole night was great.  The food was great that she made.  The dirty stuff, that was really good, too.  But she missed her last bus home.  And at the end of the night, I was like, hey, listen, it's whatever.  It wasn't that late.  But I said, let me pay for your taxi home at least.  You came all the way over here.  We had a great time.  You made the food.  Let me pay for your taxi.  That's a decent human being thing to do.  And she was like, no.  What am I, a hooker?  Keep your money.  I'll pay for my own taxi.  A-hole.  And I was like, okay.  Just trying to offer.  And it was fine.  But it's amazing.  And there's tons of girls out there that they don't want anything from you.  They want to hang out with a guy who's authentic and fun and can take care of business in a bedroom.  But he's just cool and real and cool being himself.  And not a dick.  And not needy.  And not pushy.  Definitely not needy.  And just has his shit together, frankly.  This is what they're after him.  Yeah, a lot of women out there really are down to just have a good time.  This is one of the misconceptions guys have.  You've got to do all these things.  You've got to spend this money, and you've got to take a lot of that.  It's a whole bunch of horror.  It's not true.  It's not true.  I remember once I was teaching one of my pickup boot camps.  This was back in the PUA.  heydays, guys.  They were a good time.  And I had one of my students go up to this beautiful girl.  And he spoke to her for a few minutes and he did okay, but it kind of fizzled out.  And then she left and I was like, what happened, bro?  And she's like, well, I don't know.  She just wasn't into it.  I said, okay, stay here.  I'll be right back.  I go over there.  I speak to the girl for a few minutes.  And, you know, I got her info.  I met up with her at the Starbucks a little bit later after I wrapped up with a student.  And then we went back to where I was staying and we got it on and she ended up being my lover for at least half a year.  Half a year of like really, really good times.  And what I noticed was that she was super open.  She was really, really receptive to being approached.  And I could tell she was down for a good time.  My student just didn't pull the trigger.  He didn't connect with her well enough.  He didn't pull the trigger.  So, you know, he didn't get there.  But the point is this woman who was, she was like a, it was like a, She was one of the people that she's like designing spaceship, like literally designing spaceships, astrophysicists, some crazy ass thing like that.  Super smart, very gorgeous.  And, you know, she didn't want anything from me during that six months.  She wanted to have crazy sex.  And that's it.  She wanted to have crazy sex.  That was it.  That was our whole relationship, eating and having crazy sex.  And never once did she hit me up for anything.  Nothing.  She didn't want it.  money or attention or bother me or nothing.  we just had an amazing open relationship or we just had a great time and and i've had tons tons of relationships like this there's so many women out there who just want to meet a guy to have fun with.  it's really not that big a deal and again attracting these type of women into your life.  it always comes down to how you feel about yourself right?  if you don't feel comfortable who you are and you're a little bit awkward and you don't believe in yourself and you're like i don't know if i should talk to.  I don't know.  I'm just going to look over here.  Yeah, that's not attractive, and you're not going to hook up with these girls, not with the quality ones.  So really, for all the guys out there who are like, women suck.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  There are some bad girls out there that really need to work on themselves.  I wouldn't say they're bad.  They're just still asleep, and they're not working on themselves, and they don't realize their true nature.  And they're still coming from the fear place where they think they need to compete or get the rich guy or blah, blah, blah.  They don't think they're good enough.  So, of course, they're going to have some quirks.  But if you want to get those amazing women, it always comes down to your relationship with yourself, working on yourself, doing the work, and getting to a place in your life where you value and truly respect and love who you are.  And when you're in that place, you don't really have to do things to get girls and you don't attract the crappy ones to you anymore.  You really don't.  They wouldn't think they could get you and you just wouldn't attract them into your reality.  So really, generally, wherever you're at is the type of girl you're going to attract into your life.  That's generally how it works.  And you can sometimes go higher, but then you're needy and they can sense that you got a little lucky and then they're going to ditch you eventually.  And a lot of guys shoot lower, unfortunately, because, again, they don't really feel good about themselves.  So they go for girls that are not really on their level.  So it always comes down to how you feel about yourself, guys.  It really, really does.  It comes down to your mindsets, your beliefs, and doing the work.  And if you're at that part in your life where you're really working on this specific thing, I have a webinar just about this.  It's called The Three Shifts, and it's the three mindset shifts we would invite you to make where you can become the guy that naturally attracts people.  of the women that you want to attract.  So if you're interested in that, I'll put a link below.  Do check that out.  Other than that, I hope this video cheered you up a little bit.  Really, I could go on with positive stories.  Maybe I'll just make more videos where I'm just like, here's another story of a girl who's really awesome that I was totally crazy about.  I don't know.  Maybe that will just get boring after a while.  But if you didn't and you're not subscribed to this channel, please subscribe.
