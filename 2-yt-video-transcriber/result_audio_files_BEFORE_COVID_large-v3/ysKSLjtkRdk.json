            "text": "we are exhausted.  the world is much worse than we thought it was and we already thought it was careening toward disaster.  sometimes the more we learn the more unhappy we become because the veil of the world the illusion is so neatly crafted that we could fool ourselves into thinking that the system works and that we too must be in the right if we are part of that system.  we listened to our parents and we grew up and the world was more or less what they said so long as we didn't look too closely so long as we viewed the world with one eye closed and the other only squinting.  but then we learned more and then came a false revelation.  if the world is so much worse than we thought why bother trying to fix it if it can't get better?  don't you want to see how much worse it can get?  but there is another option.  david the gnome tried to teach it to us but we forgot.  we sat on the floor of our basement and watched television early in the morning before our parents arose from their crypts.  david had a bone to pick with us he said because human beings were destroying the world ruining the rivers and forests around his home.  we were surprised because we didn't know.  ignorance is bliss.  david tried to teach us something that parents sometimes don't.  he tried to teach us empathy.  movies and television mock themselves showing characters who were raised on tv instead of raised by their parents and how terribly they turned out.  but did those who were raised by their parents turn out better?  they became trolls.  they became monsters.  our parents said things like stay out of trouble and don't talk back to me and believed that these were lessons in good behavior.  Stay out of trouble doesn't teach empathy.  It teaches us to avoid getting caught.  The system doesn't treat us equally, though.  So some of us may be able to avoid getting caught better than others.  Marginalized people will be hounded by those who try to catch us for not staying out of trouble, but if we listened to our parents and thought stay out of trouble was enough, then we were unconcerned about the plight of others.  we stayed out of trouble.  that means we are good right.  david had to be cautious to avoid those in the forest who would do him harm but when one of his antagonists lost their child he stepped up.  he helped he showed his empathy and he showed us how empathy works.  don't talk back to me.  does that teach empathy.  it teaches us fear.  it teaches us either that we are not as worthy of having ourselves heard as others or worse still it teaches us to want to be the one who can tell others what to do when to speak when not to speak when to act when not to act.  if we are taught only that there are those with authority and those without authority those who are bullies and those who are bullied then we might choose to be bullies and when caught out on it we might say get used to it.  life is hard.  the second part is true life is hard so why make it worse for everyone?  we learned the wrong lessons from our parents.  stay out of trouble and such.  These are survival skills at best, but they don't teach survival so much as conformity to a system that has no use for empathy.  It's designed that way.  David always talked about hoping that the children watching would share his point of view, his words.  That's what empathy means, sharing or experiencing someone else's feelings from their point of view.  Our parents said, that's just how the world works, and we believed them.  instead of questioning this.  People shrug at a world that unfairly advantages some and disadvantages others, and those of the world advantaged say, that's just how the world works.  People who are granted unfair advantages by the system always think that the system is fair, and people who are shown unfair disadvantages by the system know that it's not.  How convenient for the unfairly advantaged people that the system just so happens to work for them.  If the advantaged people thought about empathy for one second, they would see from the point of view of the disadvantaged.  But we were all taught, stay out of trouble, as our morality, as our compass, as our guide to life, so we mistakenly believe that those who are disadvantaged simply didn't stay out of trouble.  If we were lucky, parents might have sat us down for the talk about the birds and bees, but parents didn't sit us down for the talk about empathy.  about why we should treat others well.  some tried but couched it only in the authority of god and by doing so gave us the impression that if our lives fell apart it was only because we were no longer in his grace.  maybe we should have been raised by david the gnome.  instead he always went out of his way to help others humans animals even trolls.  he had such high hopes for us believed that we would save the world from our parents but instead we just turned into them.  we took their place in the system and we are making the exact same mistakes.  david spoke gently to the children who watched but he also taught hard lessons.  he didn't lie to us.  he showed us that we live we love we suffer and we die but the fact that life is hard was never an excuse to be unkind.  david knew he was about to die.  since we first met him he never thought why bother don't you want to see how much worse it can get?  david traveled all over the world to help people even in his final days.  even his death was about helping people.  he and his wife lisa became trees to offer shade and protection to others.  david always expressed his emotions.  he didn't bottle them up inside.  nobody ever told him to suck it up and he never told that to us either.  he wanted us to be emotionally healthy.  he told his wife that he loved her all the time.  he showed affection.  he called people my friend when greeting them.  he confessed to the children watching that his life as a doctor sometimes made him nervous because of the lives that were in his hands.  david treated his wife lisa as his partner and never spoke down to her when she set out to rescue him.  david was pleased as well as proud of her.  he never became insecure about the fact that he needed rescuing.  david tried to teach children that growing up didn't mean growing old and that we could if we wanted retain our innocence and our empathy even after becoming old.  david was almost four hundred years old and he never became bitter or resentful of the younger generation.  we didn't live up to his ideals not by any stretch of the imagination.  we grew up believing the lies and half-truths and obfuscations that our parents taught us either directly by their words or indirectly by the greater implications of their words.  we should have been raised by david the gnome.  he was a far better role model than anyone who wanted that position who wanted to mould us into smaller versions of themselves.  all we can do now is try to break free from the bad lessons that were instilled in us at a young age to reject the idea that empathy is a weakness.
