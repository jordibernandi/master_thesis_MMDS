            "text": "Only the executive branch has police power, as Alexander Hamilton points out in the Federalist Papers.  And when they refuse to use that, Bill Barr is in charge of the police powers right now.  What does Congress do?  Check it out.  Leave your comments, ring the bell, share it with your friends, and please subscribe to our channel.  Particularly a lot of people, you know, who grew up, say, you know, or went to elementary school, primary school, you know, post Reagan, basically, didn't study civics in school.  A lot of schools no longer teach civics, and it's been that way since the 80s.  And so, you know, this whole thing about the three branches of government, a lot of people don't get it.  Alexander Hamilton lays it out in Federalist No.  78 quite clearly and explicitly.  This is my describing it rather than reading it to you because it's all 18th century language.  But basically what he says is, and he was trying to sell the Supreme Court, so he was talking about how harmless it is.  And he said, Congress has the power to appropriate and spend money.  But that's it.  They make the laws.  The courts have the ability to adjudicate the laws, to determine who is guilty of breaking the law and who is innocent.  and define what the penalty will be so.  the legislature makes the laws that's article one branch of government.  the article three branch of government the courts you know adjudicates the laws and then once someone is determined to have broken the law then that the courts handed off to the article two branch of government.  that's the executive branch of government which is where all police power lies whether it's the military whether it's the fbi whether, you know, whatever it may be.  Police powers always exist under the executive, in a town.  The mayor is the head of the police department, not the city council.  Well, it may vary.  Actually, it may vary from town to town.  But if it looked like the federal government, that would be how it is.  So this scenario that I played out.  Right now we're seeing this dance where it's fairly high stakes but not quite high stakes, right?  Trump has defined subpoenas from Congress who wants to investigate the crimes that he has committed.  We know of at least a dozen crimes that Donald Trump has committed.  In addition to being unfit to hold office and lying to us 10,000 times and all that kind of stuff, he ordered Don McGahn to defy a subpoena today.  That's obstruction of justice.  He appealed a federal court's ruling after it upheld a congressional subpoena.  His Treasury Department rejected a subpoena to turn over his taxes.  He broke the law.  These are violations of the law.  And not to mention the 10 or 12 specific obstruction of justice attempts that are outlined in the Mueller report, which clearly points out that Trump broke the law.  So right now, everybody's just kind of yelling at each other.  And Trump is holding firm and saying, I'm the tough guy.  I'm the strong man here.  I'm not going to let my people testify.  And they're not.  So what if Congress pulls out the ultimate weapon that they have?  which is impeachment.  And they say, okay, fine.  We're gonna open an impeachment hearing.  We now have expanded powers.  The Supreme Court will recognize that we have expanded powers.  We have grand jury powers.  We can compel testimony.  We can put people in jail if they refuse to testify.  And so they are holding their hearings and they say to Don McGahn, okay, Don McGahn, you better show up and testify.  And Trump says no.  And McGahn says no.  And so Congress holds McGahn in contempt of Congress.  It goes to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court says, McGahn, you have to testify or you have to go to jail.  And Congress says, OK, the hearing's today.  Where's McGahn?  He's not here.  OK, send him to jail.  Well, who do they ask to send McGahn to jail?  The head of the Justice Department.  They send that request to Donald Trump and Bill Barr.  You think Bill Barr is going to put Don McGahn in jail?  The limit of Congress's police power is basically the building.  They have a sergeant at arms.  They have their own police department that basically is there to protect them, and in some cases to protect them from each other.  You know, Matthew Lyon and I forget his first name, Griswold was his last name.  Matthew Lyon was the state representative from Vermont and Griswold was the state representative from Connecticut.  And Lyon on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1790, 17, I forget the year, anyhow, in the 1790s, Matthew Lyon stood up and said to Griswold, oh, this was 1799, actually, because this was, or 1798, this was right after the Alien Sedition Act was passed.  Lyon says to Griswold, you, sir, are only defending the interests of the rich.  Griswold grabs a poker out of a fireplace.  on the floor of Congress and runs over and hits Matthew Lyon with it.  They get in a fist fight on the floor of the House.  Who breaks it up?  The sergeant at arms, the Capitol Police.  Not the Capitol Police in quotes, that's literally a legal entity, but the Congress's police.  So that's basically what they've got.  They've got that police force.  That police force is not gonna go out and get Dom again.  So what happens?  What happens when the Supreme Court orders the president to allow his people to testify?  And he says no.  Now this has happened three times in our history.  And twice it was done by, and let me just lay this out for you, twice it was done by a president whose picture is hanging next to Donald Trump as he sits at his desk.  in the Oval Office, that's Andrew Jackson.  Andrew Jackson, when John Marshall ruled that Andrew Jackson could not do the Trail of Tears, Andrew Jackson said, you know, John Marshall's made his decision, let him enforce it.  Knowing that the Supreme Court doesn't have a police force.  They couldn't stop him.  And Andrew Jackson was the commander in chief of the military and he said, go ahead, he said to the army, take those Indians from Georgia and march them to Oklahoma.  And they did.  And then two years later, the Supreme Court said to Andrew Jackson, you may not shut down the Second National Bank of the United States.  That's for Congress.  That's not your purview.  Congress created that.  You can't do that.  And Andrew Jackson did it anyway.  Which led to the deepest and longest depression in the history of the United States, but he did it anyway.  And then the other time, so there's two examples.  There was a president... that is Donald Trump's hero, who did not respect the Constitution or the authority of the Supreme Court.  And there was nothing anybody could do about it.  And people died because of it.  The Indians from Georgia.  The Cherokee.  The third time this has happened was in 1861, when Abraham Lincoln was sworn into office.  And he said, you know, that decision of the Supreme Court in 1858, Dred Scott, Roger Taney, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, ruled that in every state in the Union, people of color are property, not humans.  And I'm not going to respect that.  We're not going to respect that.  And the President of the United States defied the Supreme Court.  And what happened?  a half a dozen states in the south said the president is out of control the president is lawless our country is falling apart.  this is a crisis.  we are withdrawing from the union and we fought a civil war and six hundred thousand americans died.  now you know maybe there are other examples that i don't know but those are the only two that come to mind.  so what happens if congress starts an impeachment hearing and says, okay, McGahn, and it could be anybody.  It could be tax returns, it could be whatever.  I'm just using Don McGahn as a for example.  They start an impeachment hearing and they say, Don McGahn, you have to testify now.  This is an official impeachment hearing.  The Constitution provides for this.  We now have judicial power.  Stand before us and speak.  And McGahn says, no, President told me not to.  And Congress goes to the Supreme Court and says, hold him in contempt of Congress.  And the Supreme Court says, okay, Don McGahn, you're in contempt of Congress.  Now, what's the penalty for contempt of Congress?  You get thrown in jail until you're not in contempt, until you comply.  And so the Supreme Court says to Donald Trump, the guy who controls the police power of the United States, please have Don McGahn arrested and thrown in jail.  And Donald Trump says to the Supreme Court the same thing.  Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln said to the Supreme Court, stuff it.  Ain't going to do it.  At that point, have we ceased to be a functioning republic?  I have an article that raises these questions.  It's all over the Internet.  You can find it on Alternet or Raw Story or Truthdig or Common Dreams, you know, about the parallels between what we're going through right now and what Rome went through at the end of their republic.  I mean, this is literally how the Roman Republic died.  The country of Rome continued.  The empire of Rome continued for another 1,400 years.  Rome didn't fall until 1453, when Constantinople was sacked.  But it ceased to be a republic around 30 or 40 B.C.  with the assassination of Caesar and the starting of the triumvirate and all that kind of stuff.  Because basically the rule of law no longer stood.  People didn't respect the institutions of the republic.  They respected who had the strongest army.  It became a nation of warlords.  Neither the Capitol Police nor the Secret Service.  I mean, they both answer to the president.  I get it.  The sergeant at arms in the House answers to Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell.  And there you may have a little bit of dissonance.  What happens if Nancy Pelosi says, well, if Don McGahn wanders into the Capitol building, please arrest him.  And Mitch McConnell says to the Capitol, to the sergeant at arms, if Don McGahn wanders into the Capitol building, please release him.  I mean, you can see where this is going.  And Trump has clearly war-gamed this thing out, Trump and Barr.  And they've decided that they're not answerable to anybody, that they're going to turn the United States into a strongman form of government rather than a small-D democratic, small-R republic. ",
