            "text": "Many people think of the Flint water crisis when they hear the term environmental racism, if they ever encounter it.  But that's not the only incident.  Systematic racism and white privilege means whites have had better chances at living in safe and healthy environments.  The historical, political, and economic dominance of white Americans, thanks to factors including but not limited to voter suppression tactics, stolen land and wealth, redlining, zoning, and gerrymandering, and mass incarceration, has played a vital role in not only where black people live, but what potential hazards get placed in their vicinity.  It was in the late 70s that my dear home state of North Carolina decided to place a landfill for the disposal of PCBs, a toxic chemical, in Warren County, an area that was 62% black.  A group of locals organized against the proposal, with civil rights leader Benjamin Chavez Jr.  at the helm, who created the term environmental racism.  defining it as racial discrimination in environmental policymaking, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the ecology movements.  Since then, examples of environmental racism have come to include communities with inaccessible water, poor sewage systems, and flood vulnerability.  And a lot of these things have been occurring in the black community stretching much further back than the late 70s.  For example, in the 40s, Vanport, Oregon, a city right next to Portland, is growing rapidly thanks to shipbuilding for World War II.  Up until 1926, blacks hadn't been allowed to move into Oregon, meaning it was mostly white and described as a pristine utopia where land was plentiful and diversity was scarce.  But after World War II got started and white men were drafted overseas in droves, shipyard labor shortages in Portland attracted large numbers of black southerners.  The one small neighborhood where blacks were permitted to live was quickly overwhelmed with families.  But the Portland Housing Authority didn't want to offer any good permanent housing for the workers, thinking it would make them want to stay after the war ended.  So they created Vanport, which came to consist of roughly 40,000 working class residents, 40% of them black.  So that means nearly all of the area's black population lived within this one city.  And in spring of 1948, a railroad dike cracked and soon a flood began.  The city's residents weren't warned or evacuated.  By the time flooding was over, 18,500 families were displaced, a third of them black.  This 1940s example mirrors 2005's Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans where a mostly poor and disproportionately black population redlined in the vulnerable areas weren't evacuated and were eventually displaced and left homeless by flood damage and city negligence.  In both examples, residents couldn't just easily relocate, let alone evacuate.  Economic barriers bar many poor people of all races from moving into safer neighborhoods and leaving poverty behind, something I discuss at length in the video Zip Code Race and Class, available on YouTube.  This means class is an important factor in the quality of the environment one grows up in.  Neighborhoods with wealth have the ability to stand up to plan toxic additions to their environment and the time and organization to fight for sustained periods of time.  But how important is race?  According to the quote unquote father of environmental justice, Robert D. Bullard, Race has been found to be an independent factor not reducible to class in predicting the distribution of air pollution, contaminated fish consumption, the location of municipal landfills and incinerators, the location of abandoned toxic waste dumps, and lead poisoning in children.  During the 1970s, concerns about the environment were still relatively new, and frankly, to most politicians, taking a backseat to the oil and economic crises.  Chemical waste management opened a huge facility in Amell, Alabama in 1978, an extremely poor town that was 94% black.  The poverty level was 42.7%.  And local politicians told residents that they were being gifted with a brick factory bringing jobs when it was actually just a toxic waste dump that brought in dangerous shit from across the world for profit, ruining the air and water quality for the people who lived in a mill.  In 1985, the New York Times reported that Sumter County, where Amell is located, collected roughly $2 million from chemical waste management, which by then had become the largest employer in the area.  Though the largest employer, it wasn't at all the best occupation.  Kay Kiker was a white woman living in the area who came to be an environmental justice activist.  In an interview, she described the working conditions of that plant.  She said, they were exposed to all kinds of chemicals.  I mean their shoes would melt on their feet in the pits.  They didn't have respirators or protective clothing or anything.  Men would then go home and their clothes would be washed in the family wash.  The other issue, of course, would be the environment.  How much waste would then be put in the ground?  Sumter County had a population of 17,000 and was 69% black.  The governor was the famed racist and segregationist George Wallace, whose son-in-law was one of the three partners who arranged for the facility's location and erection.  Though numerous efforts have been made to move the quote-unquote Cadillac of landfills from Sumter, it still resides there today.  In fact, lots of poor mostly black towns still have such harmful facilities nearby.  While many newly middle-class white Americans were living in suburbia and seeing improving quality of life at the beginning of the Reagan years, things were a bit different for black people.  Under the new federalism his administration endorsed, there was a reduction in programs meant to monitor the environment and public health.  Because black people were disproportionately living in aging public housing or enclaves with relatively little political power, they would feel the brunt of this decision.  In the 1980s, Chester, Pennsylvania, a city that was 75% black, saw massive deindustrialization.  Employment plummeted and poverty soared.  The city also began attracting hazardous waste facilities.  who would pay well to dump there.  Over the following years, there was an increase in health issues like underweight babies and lung cancer.  The authorities initially insisted nothing was wrong.  until grassroots organizations filed so many lawsuits the waste facilities began leaving.  In Dixon, Tennessee, a town of 12,000, 35 miles west of Nashville, there is only a 4.5% black population, but they all live in the En-Road community where waste has been dumped for over 40 years.  Though the landfill has violated operation laws several times, it's continuously been authorized to operate by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.  Even though the waste poisoned local drinking water, the city of Dixon, the TDEC, and the Environmental Protection Agency okayed the water, despite it testing positive for hazardous waste.  A black family, the Holtz.  family, the Holtz, managed to connect their various health problems to the contaminated water with the help of Robert Bullard.  They brought up a lawsuit in 2002 that they finally won in 2011, though several white families in the area who sued had their lawsuit settled back in 2006.  But speaking of water, I can't let our conversation on environmental racism skip past the Navajo Nation, whose residents have faced water contamination since at least the 1950s.  The indigenous reservation territory is located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, with around 350,000 citizens.  Navajos are 67% more likely than any other Americans to not have running water or toilets in their homes, and more than 54,000 residents collect water from unregulated, potentially dangerous sources.  Because of the scarcity of water, many people living on these reservations have to source water from miles away, which is super expensive.  Remember that these reservations were areas deemed suitable for human living by a racist government that committed genocide against indigenous people Another form of environmental racism that must go examined happens frequently in public housing, which again matters when talking about race because black people are twice as likely as whites to live in poverty and also face significant challenges in finding affordable housing.  An analysis of federal housing data shows that health and safety inspection scores have been declining for years with few consequences.  Compounding matters, a move towards providing public housing in the private market ever since the 80s has meant greedy landlords can neglect rental properties, leading to a host of problems.  Nearly 160,000 units of private properties with federal contracts have failed at least one inspection since 1999.  Louisiana and Mississippi, two states with significantly poor black populations, who historically profited from an exploited and brutalized slave class, have the highest inspection failure rates.  This comes with a host of detrimental effects.  In 2015, families in subsidized housing reported at least 155,000 more cases of childhood asthma than other renters.  Cockroach and rodent infestation, common in old, neglected housing projects and private residences, are linked to physical health issues as well as mental health issues like depression.  Another effect of old, neglected housing is that 11.2% of black kids compared to 2.3% of white kids are poisoned with lead every year.  meaning black children are about five times more likely to have lead poisoning than white ones.  There are tons of other examples of environmental racism that I could list in locations from Uniontown, Alabama to Fresno, California to St.  Joseph, Louisiana, where communities of color are blighted by environmental neglect.  The effects are devastating and only made worse by the Trump administration's loosening of already loose environmental standards.  As The Atlantic reported, under the guidance of President Trump and the administrator Scott Pruitt, the EPA has begun to walk back already anemic federal environmental justice work, putting a stop to some civil rights investigations and replacing or firing many of the scientists with deep technical knowledge of the subject.  A Yale University study looking at 14 air pollutants found that Latinos had the highest exposure rate for 10 of the pollutants, whites had the lowest exposure rate for 11 of the pollutants, and black people had higher exposure rates than whites for 13 of the pollutants.  Black people are three times more likely to die from exposure to air pollutants than whites.  All of this must be included in conversations about affordable health care, housing, the environment, and the welfare of children.  And it all must be addressed in policymaking.
