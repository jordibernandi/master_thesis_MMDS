            "text": "Now, the first way that people in the most obvious way that people suggest you handle the charge of racism is by denying it.  And the denial comes by several ways, of course, as someone just mentioned.  And then we have another one, Caesar, I have a non-white friend.  I can't be racist because I have a non-white friend.  And I can't be racist because, or what's another one?  I've dated non-whites, so I can't be racist because of that.  What's another one?  There's non-white blood in me, right?  That's another one, right?  I can't be racist because my grandpappy was an American Indian or what have you.  That's another way to deny that you are a racist.  What are some others?  How about the most pathetic one that we see?  See, even if it's not true.  Take the high road and not defend yourself.  I have a black, okay.  So ECD14U says, now are you saying you have a black wife or are you saying that's one of the denials?  Yeah, indeed.  I mean, this is what we see.  You have a Jeep Grand Cherokee.  That's great.  Not a racist because my Jeep is a Grand Cherokee.  That's a great one.  That's funny.  You have a spouse with a non-white boyfriend.  I guess that would be a way.  Yeah, probably some trolls in there.  HB 2014.  What is the way that is probably the most pathetic, cuckservative denial?  Does anybody know that?  Their pathetic denial is, I'm not the racist.  You are the real racist.  And we hear that from the cuckservatives and the libertarians and the liberalists and the propertarians.  You are the real racist, not me.  That is pathetic.  Has that ever worked?  What are some of the outcomes?  Looks like we have a super chat.  from English Warrior, I think.  Four pounds, 99 pence.  The White Pawns will beat the King.  Greetings from England.  Every group has in-group preference is how I get past the race card.  That's a fantastic response.  Thank you very much for the investment and the words, English Warrior.  Suggestion.  What usually happens when you deny?  You lose, right?  They don't believe you.  You look pathetic.  You look weak.  You look spineless when you deny. ",
