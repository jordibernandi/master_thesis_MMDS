            "text": "The first time when I asked you, like I said, the first time when I asked you for your name, you said no.  I'm going to request nobody's name.  Okay, cool.  That's fine.  Look, it hurt me more for you to tell my mom and all that.  He's going to search you.  Yep.  She's arresting me for not doing the time myself.  Okay, sir, do you have anything to say?  No, sir.  No, sir.  Not a drug, nothing for somebody.  What's that, Booker?  Did you get his name yet?  Yeah, after the fifth time I was asking him to see his ID.  I think it's 785 on 229.  785, go ahead.  Last name, Booker.  First name, Quinton.  Quinton Union, Edward, Nora, Tom, Ida, Nora.  Middle initial T, Tom.  10... Where are your keys?  Where are your keys?  Okay.  Good.  Lincoln 785, Booker is clear.  I also searched the seizure.  I do not consent.  I apologize to you in advance.  Well, your car is going to be towed, so I have to do an inventory.  Yes, ma'am, Ms.  Blair.  Stand for a thing.  Yes, ma'am, Ms.  Blair.  Lincoln 785, secure.  I promise you.  Yes.  I have nothing illegal.  Secure with one.  I've done nothing illegal.  And what I'm doing is being arrested.  You are identifying myself.  Yes, you are.  I'm identifying myself.  Secure with one.  First of all, okay, I was over there looking for the girl, Brian Lane.  And he, like, parks when he sees me.  I'm like, okay, cool.  And I come out, he parks again.  And then I go that way, and he's still parked back there, coming around this way.  And then I'm like, that's weird.  And then he comes and parks right here and sits on the car again.  I'm like, okay, I'm calling this out because that's just weird.  What are you doing?  So when I asked, he was just sitting on the car, and I identify him.  Well, I asked him to identify him.  He's like, no.  I'm like.  Actually, you have to tell me.  So I was getting irritated.  And then he was like, then he told me his name, but he had his ID and never, like, showed me.  But still, he said no the first time.  So that's why I'm arrested.  He wants a sergeant, but who's coming?  So what's the tow?  Because it's just in the roadway?  Well, I guess I don't have to do it, but I'm searching anyways.  I said... I'm sorry.  Let me calm down real quick.  You're good.  He just pissed me off.  So he was basically just, like, following you?  No, he wasn't following me.  He was on Brian Lane.  And you just stopped him parking on your spot?  Yeah.  Just kept... Every time he saw me, he just parked.  So that's why I called it out.  Oh, yeah.  I got... Suspicious vehicle.  I'm like, I'm going to stop this because he's being weird.  Okay.  Thank you. ",
