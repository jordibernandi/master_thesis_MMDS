It's a modern day problem and you wouldn't have these problems if you would simply eat meat.  It doesn't have to be only meat, but mostly animal products, and you would have no acne.  It would all disappear.  I understand that you've been brainwashed to believe that plants are the answer, but they are all man-made, they are unnatural, and it's not what humans ever consumed.  And this is why we have the modern-day problems.  In nature, humans mostly eat raw meat and drink blood, but it's something that's been covered up.

People are guilt-tripped into it.  It's trendy nowadays.  If everybody's doing it, then why not?  What can you lose?  Your health.  Do vegans care about human health?  In no way whatsoever.
