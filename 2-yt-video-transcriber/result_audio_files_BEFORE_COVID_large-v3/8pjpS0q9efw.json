            "text": "This is a response to Gabriel Bueno, a member of our Patreon community, who asks about market socialism versus centralized socialism.  What exactly is meant there?  How does it relate to the old and new socialisms we've been talking about at Economic Update?  And wouldn't a market socialism be subject to the same sorts of abuses, monopoly,  etc.,  that capitalism is subject to.  So let me respond step by step.  First, the old socialism includes both market and plan.  It's not the new socialism.  Let me explain.  In the old socialism, the socialism that comes out of the second half of the 19th century and really is the dominant form of socialism in the 20th century, had a dispute.  A dispute between market socialists and planned or centralized or state socialism.  Here was the idea.  One side, the state socialism, if you like, or the planned socialism, believed that the distribution of resources among enterprises and the distribution of the products, goods and services coming out of enterprises, ought to be accomplished by a conscious, deliberate plan, hopefully democratically arrived at, that would decide how the society wanted to use the resources it had and how it wanted to use and distribute the products that emerged from the production process.  The idea was socialism was planning.  But there were others who said, no, socialism is about how you organize the society as a whole, how you organize production, how you organize politics and culture, but there is no problem in a socialist society using markets to distribute resources and products, letting different enterprises bargain and negotiate with one another and accomplish distribution that way.  The latter group was called market socialists, and the other one was called planned socialists.  They both agreed that the government, for example, should provide basic services to everybody, education, housing, medical care, transportation, and so on, that it should guarantee everybody a job, so forth.  But the distribution arrangement was disagreed on.  planning for one group, market socialism for the other.  When I talk about old and new socialism, I mean something new that is different from both the market and the planning.  I mean a socialism that is concerned in a prioritized way with the organization of the enterprise, of the factory, the store, the office.  Not in the old way that a small number of people at the top make all the key decisions and the average worker, the clear majority, having to do what that small minority tells them to do.  In capitalism, the small minority is the board of directors, the major shareholders, the owners of the business.  And the mass is the workers.  in state socialism, in the kinds of socialisms we've seen in the 20th century.  The private capitalists are gone, but they're replaced by another small minority.  State officials, commissioners, commissars, the people who run the planning apparatus of the society, rather than a transformation of the workplace into a genuinely democratic socialist arrangement in which all the workers would together, one person, one vote, decide what the enterprise produces, what technology it uses,  etc.,  etc.,  in a base, ground-up-from-below kind of socialism.  That's a new focus because the old socialisms didn't do that.  Last point.  Would such a new socialism not be subject, especially if it allowed markets to work, to the same problems that capitalism had with monopoly, with great inequality?  Well, the answer is you transform capitalism into socialism because it's worth doing itself.  It's worth democratizing the enterprise, which is the key part of this, bringing democracy finally to the workplace where people spend most of their adult lives.  This is a value in itself, but it still leaves open if you allow the different cooperatives, especially in a market arrangement, to do better or worse.  What do you do if some become rich and others become poor?  By the way, the same problem happened inside capitalism.  And there were capitalisms, at least at some periods, who put limits on that, wouldn't allow monopolies, had trust busted, had rules to prevent it.  And the same would apply in a socialist economy of cooperatives.  But we might expect a lot better progress, because for the cooperatives, it's a matter of survival of their system to keep the limits on inequality to prevent monopoly.  Capitalism always moves in that direction but has equal forces pushing for monopoly, pushing for inequality.  So I think the prospects would be better in socialism.  But socialism is worth doing because of the transformation of the workplace, whether or not that can also extend to doing something about the inequality, the monopoly, and so on that has always played capitalism and that I think would be better treated, although it would still be a problem, within a socialist economic system.  Thank you again to Gabriel Bueno for his question and I hope he finds this a useful answer. ",
