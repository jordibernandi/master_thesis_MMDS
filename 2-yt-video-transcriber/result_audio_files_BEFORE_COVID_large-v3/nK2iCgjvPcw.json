            "text": "Good morning, brothers and sisters.  It's Pastor Tim Henderson.  Well, I want to bring you this news.  I want to say, first of all, this is not to fearmonger.  And also, this is not from my normal intel.  And it's not from any mainline media.  Several of you, this wackadoodle family, we refer to each other as a wackadoodle family because early on I was called a wackadoodle freak for Jesus.  And so it became endearing.  I don't say that to be offensive.  I've been trying not to say it all the time.  As some of you have said, if you could just listen, love you, honor you.  We are a family.  So often, many of you share information with me.  And so I looked at some of the sources, some of the videos that you guys had, and I believe this could very well be true.  I believe it to be true.  Again, it's not my normal intel sources, so I'm putting that out there, that caveat up front.  We know that we know the number of earthquakes that have been on the West Coast from Canada right down through California along the Cascadia subduction area.  We also know that there exists, I know there's over a dozen volcanoes.  Seismologists and scientists are concerned that with these earthquakes happening, and the number of aftershocks that they could cause some of these volcanoes to become, I don't know if they're already active or things to happen.  But more importantly, they're, What's coming out through some channels, and I'm not going to endorse those channels yet.  I'd like to follow them for a while before I do.  But if they give us vital information, absolutely, I'll endorse them.  And thank you again.  The last sister who shared, shared one that I think probably is a vital one.  But again, I'll watch.  I'll follow for a while.  In any event... It's reported that an analyst at the USGS leaked that they are watching magma chambers under California that are active and larger than Yellowstone.  You heard me right.  Active magma chambers larger than Yellowstone.  We have seen volcanoes this past year.  Remember what happened in Hawaii?  Remember what happened in... Was it... Guatemala, I can't remember.  But we know, yes, I believe it was Guatemala.  Remember what happened and the activity with volcanoes around the world?  Well, this is what they would describe as a super volcano that is forming under California.  And the fear is, this is what's being reported, the fear is that with another sizable earthquake, it could create shifting with those fault lines and active magma could come to the surface and brothers and sisters.  This is a serious threat.  It's also reported by these channels and and those report and again, I'm sharing with you.  I have Intel sources.  This is not.  I haven't seen anything on the main line or alternate media.  However, this makes sense to me.  And so I believe there very well could be truth that this could be true.  And so again, not for anyone to fear, but it's reported that FEMA is already prepared to fly in and take out key leaders in the nation and key people at that time.  So they are prepared to do that.  What would I say?  Continue to pray.  I believe, we believe that the rapture is imminent.  We also know that the peace plan does call for the division of the nation of Israel to give land for a two-state solution.  That is never good.  It's not right.  And it's never good for the nation that does that.  Brothers and sisters, we are in the final moments of the end of days.  I've been saying for a long time, We're in the calm before the storm.  And as they come down, whatever they are, whether it's natural disasters, asteroid, solar flares, nuclear attack, whatever it is, we go up, meaning the rapture of the church.  I speak about that a lot on videos.  I'm also a grace preacher.  The ABCs of salvation are in the description box, as is.  I just got inspired.  I'm going to do a short video, maybe later today or in the coming days, not too far out, on what the rapture is and put that in the description box as well.  There are two videos in the description box.  One is about how we can be born again and saved.  When a sinner admits they're a sinner in need of a Savior and believes on the redemptive work of Christ on the cross at Calvary for the remission of all their sins, They are saved and sealed.  That nanosecond they believe until the day of redemption.  I go into greater detail in the video, Faith Plus Nothing Equals Salvation and Eternal Security.  I think regarding the imminent rapture, I'll do a video on that.  And... And put that in the description box as well so that we can refer to it because I bring events and news that are coming so that we can keep informed.  Well, there you have it.  They're saying a super volcano is forming and FEMA is getting prepared. ",
