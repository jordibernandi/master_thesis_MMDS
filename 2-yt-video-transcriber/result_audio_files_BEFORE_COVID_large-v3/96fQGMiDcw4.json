            "text": "Is there a way the world could be started over?  if you were to encourage people to create their own reality, to let go and stop, I guess you could say, serving the interest of, even if you want to say, liberal institutions?  So how would you go about that?  I know that was a very broad bit out there.  It's eccentric.  This is what my wife calls a, you better put away the cannabis question.  Because... Because... Because... Well... I'm... What I'm grappling with is I sense that there's something you're trying to point at.  that is a weakness in contemporary conservatism.  But I don't think you're saying, and I hope you're not saying this, I'll give you an example.  Like today, I turn on the TV and I see Jussie Smollett basically saying, I was attacked.  I was attacked, right?  And he's maintaining that he was attacked, as he said originally, by these mega white supremacists.  Now, this is coming after we have seen video of two Nigerian guys who work on his show, Empire, who have been paid money by him by check.  going to a store and buying MAGA hats and rope to stage the attack, who have told the police that Jussie put them up to it.  Right?  So we know all this.  We've seen the video.  And yet here is this dude creating this alternative reality, which is that my original story was true.  And literally the people on his show have just tweeted out today, welcome back to Empire.  He's back on the show because they are believing.  So what I'm saying is this is truly the twilight zone.  It's like we all agree to ignore reality and create our own reality.  So that's not the type of creation of reality I approve of because it's difficult to live in a community where there is no empirical, logical basis for democratic citizenship.  You say something to me, you say something different than you said yesterday, you make a contract that you have no intention of keeping because you're living in your world, and only in your world.  you fulfill your contracts, but in my world you don't.  Society can't function that way.  The justice system can't function that way.  Either you did it or you didn't.  Did you see the guy do it or not?  You cross-examine people, and the underlying assumption is that there's a bedrock of facts that can't be altered.  Something actually happened, right?  And we're trying to find out what that is.  We don't get to make up what that is.  Now, there's another side of what you're saying that I totally agree with, which is that when I came to America as an immigrant, I came from a country where if I stayed there, my life would have looked a lot like my dad's.  And I would have probably gone into a profession like my dad or my grandfather, which is a technical profession.  I would be a doctor or an engineer.  Instead, I come to America, and I become this Strange individual who is incomprehensible to my own family.  I can never explain to them what it is that I actually do.  But that's America.  In America, I can create that life for myself.  And so in that sense, I'm creating my own reality, which I would not have otherwise.  But it's not a reality unmoored from empirical facts.  That's all I'm trying to say.  And you probably agree.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, by the way, I'm not a cannabis user, but.  No, no, no.  I would just do a . ",
