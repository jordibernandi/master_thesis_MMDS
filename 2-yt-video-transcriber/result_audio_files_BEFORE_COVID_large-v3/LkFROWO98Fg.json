            "text": "This is Dabu7.  A state of emergency has been declared in California.  Specifically in the Ridgecrest area.  This area seeing different types of damage from the earthquakes that have struck.  But all in all, they're saying that this isn't over.  That this swarm continues to pop off with hundreds of quakes.  They're all very shallow.  As you can see here, we covered this for hours on a live stream last night on DLive.  With running updates, and this is the update here for today.  thus far, it looks like things are kind of dying down, but they say there is a 50% chance of a magnitude 6 or greater within the coming few days, and within this week, there's at least a 10% chance of a magnitude 7 or greater.  So we could still see some activity and with swarms like this, you can see earthquakes for years to come.  So a state of emergency in effect for this region.  They are stating that per here, a risk of even bigger earthquakes are now in effect.  I want to look at a few things here real quick and compare some stuff.  I got to give a shout out to everyone out there that sends info in my way.  This is important stuff.  You got to pay attention to what's happening and what's going on sometimes here.  This is All sitting on a military testing range.  The initial quake has some very unique characteristics.  When you look at a test or a blast, a bomb going off, this is what you get.  You get one huge, big, blunt burst, and then it fades down to quiet, to almost nothing.  An earthquake, a lot of which we've been seeing since.  Don't get that twisted.  There have been earthquakes.  But what sparked the 6.4 and started this whole series of quakes is the question.  Because the 6.4 doesn't have the pattern of an earthquake.  It has the pattern of an explosion.  And this was sent to me, this information was specifically sent to me from people that have been on this base that deal with this type of stuff and it concerned them.  So they sent it my way, saying the seismograph readings don't lie.  They show us the initial burst of energy, and it was not consistent with an earthquake, a natural earthquake.  And there's different ways of tracking these waves.  This is just one.  They are convinced there was something that went down there.  That's what they're thinking.  That's what they're saying to me.  And, well... All them quakes hitting right there in this territory that the government and the military owns and runs.  And regardless, I think it's pretty ignorant when they've got all of New Mexico, all of Nevada, all these places to test weapons.  If that's the case, you have fault lines that are running down toward LA, the San Andreas.  And once again, got to give a shout out to everyone out there.  that gives me information.  This is very interesting, if you ask me, in terms of the wavelengths, what the seismographs are looking like, and just gets one thinking.  Whether that is the case or not, it looks like we're going to be dealing with this swarm for a time to come.  So, I'll continue to update with information as I get it.  Much love to everyone out there fighting the fight.  It's appreciated.  It's been Dabu7. ",
