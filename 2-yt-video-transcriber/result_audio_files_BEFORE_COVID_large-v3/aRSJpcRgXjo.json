She has a Jamaican parent and an Indian parent, and neither of those parents is an American DOS, descendants of chattel.  slavery in this country.  Not everywhere slavery.  We know that was slavery in other parts of the world.  But if you in the Caribbean or one of those places, if you in Haiti, then your issue, as we've said here many a times, is with the French.  And if you ever get reparations from the French, I will clap.  I will be happy.  I will throw you a party.  I will buy you a drink, baby.  But I will not try to take your money.  I will not try to eat that fruit.  Cause I don't have no bones buried in Haiti.  My bones is buried in here.  I celebrate you.  I will help you.  But I understand that that is yours.  And I think you understand that too.  So the real issue is just like I'm not Jamaican, just like I'm not Haitian, just like I'm not Eritrean.  You are not American DOS.  You do not have parents and grandparents who grew up on sharecropper farms who can trace their stuff black to slavery.  You do not have that.  So what that means is that you are not a part of this tribe.  That don't mean you are not black.  It means you are not a part of this tribe. ",
