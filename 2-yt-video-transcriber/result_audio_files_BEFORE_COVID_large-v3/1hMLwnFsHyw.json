And that's saying a lot because I've seen Charlie Sheen give an interview before.  It's called Charlie Sheen.  Now, Paula White is a charismatic, and she is all the time posting crazy things on Twitter.  And really, she's just a fruit of spirituality that's not bound by any doctrinal system.  I mean, if it sounds spiritual, just say it.  But she was doing something recently in a church service where she was praying.  And just listen to this for a second. ",

And the truth is that charismatic Christianity exalts experience over doctrine.  When you say things like that, you're not quoting any Bible concept.  There is nothing like that in the scriptures.  Matter of fact, everybody in the scriptures who desired for children to die was evil.  And I think maybe Paula White told on herself here.  This woman is not being led by the Holy Spirit.  This woman is not bound by any doctrinal system.  She just exalts experience over doctrine.  She's trouble.  She has a long history of immorality.  She has no holiness in her life.  She is a charlatan.  These people are dangerous because they say just enough.  that sounds right to be convincing, but then they say just enough.  that's wrong to be catastrophic to your spirituality.  I guess maybe she's talking figuratively here.  Maybe that's what she means by this.  But even still, oh Lord woman, what is wrong with you? ",

There are people out there who are rank heretics, who are charlatans, who are liars, who are literally, as 2 Corinthians chapter 11 says, ministers of Satan.
