            "text": "Black music by George.  We were talking.  He was saying.  I was with them until they made me ride in this broken-down bus by George.  Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong.  We were talking.  Could see eyes roll in a cackle.  Laugh, tongue slip, ping out the lip.  Music.  Black.  Music, drums at one point, and drums, and drums, rhythm, rhythm of beat, funk, rhythm of smoke, cook, jam, work, smoke, steam, well, cook, jam, work, smoke, steam, well, get it, get down, hit it, get up, do it, get it, get down, hit it, get up, do it, cook, cook, jam, jam, work, work, smoke, smoke, steam, well.  Oppose two opposites, two beings, seeings, we split things, we and us cut in half by life.  Social life.  Crazy nigga, Juilliard, giggling.  Blues built up in me all the time.  Can't love nothing for crying.  Can't cry for lying.  Can't love I'm dying.  And you wants to know what the blues is?  The blues is we, us.  Split in half by sorrow.  We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, us.  Then here come chamber lurkers.  Heard Berg and could not dig monk dog, bird dog, duke dog.  Thought Stravinsky was hip and he was, but what to do with trans-blusency?  Baloo, sense, ee.  Could not step, hey, step, hey.  Could not twist and turn, hey, turn, hey.  Could not get down, yeah, get down, yeah, without a crystal glass reflect vibration.  Endless melodies over one tap-tap.  Endless dragging violins singing death to niggas anyway.  A ping against the silence.  When all Michael Jackson waits to drop out from Dust Universe City, off the wall and all, hack, step, hop, jump, funk, and then, yeah, bump, jump, hey, and then, wham, each reached each whale, yeah, dum, dum, dum, say, look, touch, blue suit, Humberg tails, bare feet, nails, conk, funk, honk.  This is not bebop.  he said.  And he were right, far right.  This ain't even, excuse me, certainly this is not what is known as blues, a colored object.  And we fell down in his head, weeping and kneeling and feeling sorry, tragic, small and samboish, like something Ralph Ellison despised.  We felt like that amidst the violins and twinkle, twinkle dots and dashes of snowman jism.  They shot out of their fingertips like dollar confetti.  Aha, here he come!  Blow, bluey, blue, screech and screech on his heels, turn the corner of the bar on two wheels, give me a double bourbon.  Then sat and came in on the flat.  five like a flat speech full of death and laughter and lynch screech.  Rudy Tooty, motherfuckers, he began, and straight, no chaser, he went on, nutty, he called, looking at the colorless negro piano player from no heaven.  then shit they got mean from the back room.  a nigga with a two-tone beard and distance rolling out of his nose.  it ain't about you he said.  eyeing the dead things who are making dusty quartets without a shape philosophers and the suicidal solipsists threw down their violins hiding their alienation under white women.  ghosts ghosts he screamed.  eerie blue down low shit spooky niggas scared of everything.  ghosts a honk a mean low scream like rich people dying in front of their offices with with nigger janitors grinning and Susie queuing in the jeeps with mounted bazookas, weird march music for weird marches.  We rose from our paralyze, stuttering, and ran to meet them.  Albert, monk we call, where's him before we got it out?  John Coltrane came down through the roof, blowing impressions faster than light.  Or was it Pharaoh, Chico, Rocky, Tyrone, David, Arthur, Julius, Hamid, Oliver, Joseph... And the dismal Pinkerton niggas sued for peace, which meant they could only produce their albums with a disclaimer that said, this music will turn you into rich people's underwear.  And they went out in the snow of their own creation, humming the Fano E. Franklin Fraser Black Anglo-Saxon Unblues.  And what did we do?  We did what we needed to do.  We blew and blew and blew, blew, blew, blew, blew, blew, and even reached you, and even reached you, and even reached you, and even reached you, and even reached you, reached you, reached you, you.
