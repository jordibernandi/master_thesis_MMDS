            "text": "Thank you.  hey everybody how's it going?  i'm so happy to be here with you guys again.  i love all the love and support you guys be giving me.  uh all the follows all the subscribers all the likes everything the comments.  it's just been it's been phenomenal.  so uh i thank you all ahead of time for that and if you're new here please subscribe.  uh turn on that little bell notification and you'll get to hear every time i put a new video out.  also if you get a chance in the description is my ebay store link to my ebay store.  i sell a ton of cool uh clothing like a lot of the stuff you'll see in the background of my pictures.  um lot of cool vintage even like this shirt old vintage sportswear things of that nature.  so all guys stuff guy clothing shoes accessories all kinds of cool stuff.  so a little bit of women stuff in there but not a lot pretty much all for the guys.  so without further ado though today's video is gonna be a funny one.  i got a text message.  it's a couple months ago and i didn't know who it was from and i was a little.  you know i don't play those games when it comes to that.  so if i get a message from somebody i don't know i'll.  just i won't even you know i if you don't want to tell me who you are.  i'm not here to play games so uh but this one was a fun game to play.  so um i'm gonna do my best at my editing here to try to put all these little message blurbs up here in the corner but hopefully you can follow along.  Uh, so I don't know where, like I said, I get this text message and it simply says, what's up?  So I replied back with the good old new phone.  Who dis?  I get back, you're an ass, but let me tell you, I got that back days later.  It was days later.  It looks in the pictures here like it's hours later, but that was multiple days had passed.  At this point, I'm like, okay, I'm an ass.  I don't even know who you are.  I replied back with, for real, I don't know who this is.  Simple, right?  I get hit back with, it wouldn't matter anyways, Keith.  She hits me with my name.  Little weird, right?  Don't know who this is.  I'm assuming it was a lady friend that I met along the way.  Uh, but you never know.  So I respond back with what brought you to randomly text me?  And it's an enough question.  does it matter?  she says you still don't know who it is.  clearly I don't know who it is.  I already told you I don't know who this is.  I thought you were a good person.  she says just because I don't have your phone number saved in my phone I'm a bad person.  now you know me.  phones I've already been through like multiple phones within the last year.  right it happens but I thought you were a good person.  okay.  So I hit her back with this.  I can still be a good person and not save your number.  So you can tell me who you are or what?  To which she responds, nope.  Just block the number.  You're better off.  At this point, I pretty much figured it was definitely a chick because there ain't no dude that's going to be playing games like this.  He would have been like, what's up?  I would have said, new phone, who it is?  He would have been like, bro, it's John.  How are you, man?  You trying to go golf this weekend or do something fun?  No chick would ever, no dude would ever play games like this.  Totally a chick.  So at this point now, I'm intrigued because I want to know who it is.  She says, bye, Keith.  So I just tell her, I'm intrigued, but I do not want to play this game any longer.  Last chance.  Gotta put him in her place, right?  Lindsay, nothing special, bye.  Okay, so at this point, I know who it is, right?  I met this chick on a dating site, which, by the way, guys, do not, I tried it.  I tried it for a decent amount of time.  Do not attempt Tinder, any of that stuff.  They are just full of single moms, crazy women who are just looking to lock guys down and take you for all you're worth.  There are no real women on there looking for real relationships.  They're just not on there.  They're looking for a simp to take care of them.  That's what they want.  Or they just want Chad and Tyrone to bang them out.  So, Lindsay, nothing special, bye.  So this girl, what happened was we went on a date, met her on a dating site.  We went on a date and it didn't, I didn't really hit it off with her.  You know, she's one of them ones where, ladies, I learned after, actually I think this might have been my last experience drinking, so I'll tell you why in a minute.  But ladies, please, if you're listening to this, put real pictures out there, right?  Put a body picture up, even if you're a little bit of a bigger girl.  Just put it up.  It's gonna save you time and hassle, right?  This girl wasn't fat by any means, but she was a bigger bone girl, and that's just not my style, right?  I just don't like that type.  I'm allowed to have a type, right?  So we go out, we have some drinks.  She wasn't bad, but I could tell right away she had that clinger vibe to her.  Just the way, the thing she was saying, and you guys, you've been there, right?  You've been there with a woman who you're just like, stage five clinger.  So we were drinking.  I tried to make the best of it.  And unfortunately I got a little too drunk and she invited me back to her place and I was drunk at the time.  So I said, sure.  And I followed her back to her place, and by the time we got there, I was starting to sober up a little.  Not a lot, but a little.  Because it was a long drive.  She had me following her.  I mean, we're going through all these back roads.  I didn't even know where the hell we were going.  So I finally get to her place, and she starts taking me upstairs.  She lives in a duplex, of course, and she lives up on the top floor of it.  And I'm following her up the steps, and already at that point, I'm like, man, I don't even know if I want to do this.  But... I wasn't thinking with this head.  I was thinking with that head.  I went through with it.  It is what it is.  It wasn't my brightest, my shiniest moment, but it is what it is.  But afterwards, I kind of... I guess I kind of ghosted her a little bit.  Whatever.  I mean, I knew I didn't want to see her again.  I knew it wasn't going to work.  And I don't even know if I broke it off, but I ghosted her.  So I didn't see her for a while after that.  Maybe like four or five months later, I seen her at a bar one night when I was out with my buddies from work.  But we just kind of said that she was out with her work friends too.  And I just said, Hey, how you doing?  That was it.  And cause I knew right away, I was like, I do not want this girl talking to me.  She is nuts.  So we're talking, this was years ago.  I mean, this is shortly after I moved back from Florida.  So probably around 2014, somewhere in there, 15.  So, you know, we're talking a solid three to four years ago that this happened at the time.  Well, let's, let's make it an easy two years, right?  We'll say it was at least two years, probably more than that, but we'll say two to three years, uh, at that point.  I'm just thinking, like, you've got to be kidding me, right, that this chick is \u2013 we're talking years later that she's hitting me up with these messages.  And insane, right?  To suspect that I still have your phone number in my phone and now you're mad at me that I don't?  Why do you still have my phone number?  Creepy, right?  This is how these women are, guys.  They'll hang on to you and they'll just \u2013 They know that they're out there finding out that there's no good guys, right?  They're running trains on all these guys.  They're pumping and dumping on them.  And now they're getting to a point.  Her clock's ticking.  She's trying to find somebody to snuggle down with.  And she's going through her phone, finding old names and hitting them up.  So I couldn't believe that it was this girl.  But anyway, so from there, I said, wow, I haven't seen you since Jurgles.  It's a little bar by us.  that that's where I was at whenever I seen her with my work friends and her work friends.  And she goes, yeah, not sure why you disappeared, but thank you.  So I'm like, all right, I got to be straight with this girl, right?  I got to be real with her and I got to let her know what's going on.  So I send her this and it's going to look a little different than the rest because I had to pull it out of the log or whatever.  So it's what I sent her back.  I could tell you were falling hard and fast.  I, on the other hand, was not.  I regretted sleeping with you.  That was the alcohol's fault.  I realized as soon as I was going up the stairs, I was making the wrong choice, but I was already so far in and I was drunk and whatever I wanted to get laid.  I apologize for the way it went down, right?  Being a man.  I never found myself in that position before in my life.  She was actually like my first, it was kind of a one night stand to me and kind of one of the first ones I ever had.  I was never really that type of guy to just run around like that.  And I said it was not one of my finest moments.  She didn't like that.  falling hard and fast she says i thought we were having fun.  this was one night woman one night that's it and and i don't know what signs you got but i definitely was not putting off like let's get married.  vibes right and i didn't talk to you afterwards.  and it's been like two to three years and you're upset and you're thinking what did you think i was going to be like lindsey?  oh my god i can't believe i haven't talked to you in years.  please let's get married crazy.  Ha fun.  You're not that fabulous.  Ha ha ha.  I am pretty fabulous by the way.  Then you ripped it out like a rug for no reason.  I assume she's talking about me talking to her and not something else being ripped out.  your loss.  It's always our loss, right?  Isn't that funny how it's always our loss, right?  This, this woman is crazy.  Clearly I was correct with the clinger part of it, right?  And it's my loss now.  Maybe you were falling hard and fast and pictured yourself falling down those steps.  Because I would have pushed you faster than you know.  Bye, Keith.  And that was the end of it.  insane to think that after all that time.  you're still hanging on and clearly you're still just swinging and missing right one after another.  you're just blowing through them.  who knows how many times you've had another dude up inside of you over these last three years and you're just randomly hitting.  what did you think i was gonna do?  But I know what she thought I was going to do.  There's probably more than enough guys that she would hit up like that.  that would say, oh my God, yeah, I would gladly come back to you.  And I just don't get it.  I was blown away that it was this chick.  And once I put two and two together, it was just like a light bulb went off in my head.  And I said that I was right.  Always trust your gut.  You always have that feeling deep down inside.  Trust it.  I hope that made you laugh a little bit.
