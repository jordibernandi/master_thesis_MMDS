They didn't call Professor Dershowitz or Ken Starr up there to be ivory tower Trump haters, one of which actually wanted to impeach Trump because he tweeted out the words fake and noose.  I want an impeachment for that.  So there was only one fact witness professor that I saw, and his testimony was exculpatory.  I want nothing, no quid pro quo. ",

The Supreme Court of the United States absolutely pulled the rug out of part two of the impeachment referral by granting certiorari, by granting review in a case where Trump challenged a congressional subpoena.  And the Supreme Court said, we're going to hear this case. ",

You don't have to comply with a subpoena of Congress unless the court tells you you have to comply.  Now, we don't know how the court's going to come out, but they made it clear that's a viable issue.  So that charge, that ground of impeachment, should be immediately removed by the House and not sent to the Senate.  There's nothing to it anymore.  after the Supreme Court today said... You're entitled to review on an issue when the president challenges the subpoena power of Congress.  All done.  It's over. ",

And I think Professor Dershowitz is right.  But when there is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch and one seeks remedy in the judicial branch, that would be our system of co-equal branches of government.
