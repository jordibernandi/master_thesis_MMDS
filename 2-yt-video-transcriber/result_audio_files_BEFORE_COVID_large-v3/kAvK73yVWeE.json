            "text": "Good morning, good morning, BigSquaredRoadDrew.com with your morning horn of Nazis.  I'm going to give up coffee for a while because I haven't been sleeping.  I've got to figure out the bootling word for tea or something.  Decaffeinated tea.  Morning news.  But I do want to talk quickly about the spike on 11-11.  In silver, everybody was pointing it out.  It looks like, unless this is a data glitch, which I don't think it is, but it could have been, it was spiked from $17 to almost $24.  And we've seen this before.  Remember, price of silver is rigged every day in every trade.  Now, there are those who are looking at this date.  I actually talked about this date on the private road.  But there were other people saying, let's do it.  Let's get all together and meditate and stuff like that.  Silver Trigger 1111.  This was posted in October.  If anything, what this was, was a message.  A message to us that they are in control with the click of a mouse.  They can put the price of silver at a million dollars an ounce or at zero dollars an ounce with the click of a mouse.  That's what this is.  A message.  How hard is it to do?  Watch.  Click.  Bingo.  That's all you got to do.  So, yes, that's what I think it was.  I think it was a message to say, hey, we're still in charge.  But the good news is for silver people, we all know that the \u2013 charges, the sentencing of those whistleblowers within J.P.  Morgan who were busted and turning state's evidence against management.  This has been going on for over a year and they keep delaying it and delaying it, delaying it.  But it looks like it's going to happen in December, which is coming up, obviously.  So keep an eye on that December timeframe because it's important.  This is John Edmonds who pleaded guilty in October.  of last year, to working with other unnamed co-conspirators to manipulate prices of gold, silver, platinum, palladium futures contracts between 2009 and 2015.  The amazing thing is that's the time when we were screening silver manipulation and the CFTC ran three investigations.  Found nothing.  Cristian Carlo needs to come out and say, yeah, not only are we rigging the crypto markets, we popped the Bitcoin bubble, but we were assisting in the rigging of the silver market.  The good thing is the good guys in the FBI are going to take these motherfuckers down, absolutely down.  His sentencing has been postponed twice, suggesting he is continuing to cooperate with prosecutors in their investigation.  And since then, they have added new people.  But here's the latest twist.  And this came out just about a week, two weeks ago.  Prosecutors asked for delays in silver case against J.P.  Morgan until Meadows' criminal case is resolved.  So there's the criminal case that's the sentencing in December.  And then there's the civil case.  And the civil case is people saying, hey, you're busted by the federal government for rigging the markets.  I lost a hell of a lot of money.  I'm going after you for money.  Everything you got, J.P.  Morgan.  And this is what this one said.  Justice Department as two civil cases against J.P.  Morgan Chase be put on hold through the conclusion of a related ongoing criminal case.  So the ongoing criminal cases against J.P.  Morgan are still going on.  And I love that.  This is for silver and gold manipulation.  Into precious metals activities at J.P.  Morgan.  The indictment alleges the traders along with Eight.  Eight unnamed co-conspirators who worked at J.P.  Morgan offices in New York, London, Singapore, participated in a racketeering conspiracy in connection with a multi-year scheme to manipulate the precious metal markets and defraud customers.  Voila, vindication.  Now we're up to eight.  Eight that have been unnamed.  I think six have been named so far.  There's eight more.  Can you say Blythe Masters and Jamie Dimon?  I can't watch.  Blythe Masters and Jamie Dimon.  100% involved in that.  Jamie Dimon is not going to have a good Christmas.  And Blythe, I think Blythe's already in jail, too.  No one's heard from her since she ran away from her DTCC crypto rigging attempt at manipulating markets in the future.  Crazy stuff, huh?  Federal prosecutors have asked two civil cases.  J.P.  Morgan put on hold until they finished related criminal prosecution involving current and former precious metals traders at the nation's largest bank.  So it's saying current.  Everybody I know who's been charged so far has left the company.  But they're saying current traders.  Who's still a J.P.  Morgan that was there back then?  Jamie Dimon's still there.  We will see.  I'm not going to go through all this.  This is the civil side.  What we care about most, unless you're, for the civil people, we really can't.  As little guys, we can't, although it affected us, We won't get far in suing Jamie Dimon.  Why?  Because most of us are not ComEx traders.  And that's where the rigging was done, they say.  Now that the ComEx price is spread out through the entire silver community.  So we can make the argument that, yeah, you were affected, but obviously they have lawyers that... We can do class action, I guess.  But then you're going to have to prove it.  If you're long-term hodlers... You kind of made off better by them rigging the prices lower.  I don't know.  The sickening part is that the CFTC for years said we were crazy.  People like Jeffrey Christian, I can't even believe that guy still speaks at events.  The heads of the mining companies in silver, are you kidding me?  Those are the guys who got me thrown out of the Silver Summit because I was screaming.  It's rigged.  It's rigged.  It's rigged.  What did they do?  Did they fix the problem?  No.  They said, no, we can't have Bix here talking about these crazy conspiracies.  It's hurting our business.  What was hurting your business is your ineptitude, your stupidity that you can't figure out what was going on.  Every single, every single CEO of every single gold mining and silver mining company should be fired unless they spoke out.  And a couple did speak out.  But if they didn't speak out, they should be fired today.  Nobody should be at the head of those companies.  Nobody.  Because it was obvious.  And it was their job to protect their industry.  And their company.  Piss me.  All right.  So, yeah.  Silver excitement coming up in December.  I hope, I hope, you crypto people, I love you to death.  But you're going to need some silver as well.  Silver and gold will be the first things they go to, the big money, because they understand that.  It's harder for them to understand cryptos.  The first thing that they go to is going to be silver and gold when manipulation ends in that world.  And we will see $700, $800, $900 silver in a blink of an eye.  I think this gold-silver ratio will go one-to-one at some point, probably around $5,000.  And you can buy silver today at $17.  Again, you can buy silver today at $17.  And I think it's going one-to-one.  Why?  Because there's 5 billion ounces of gold in the world and there's 5 billion ounces of silver.  And silver is more important.  Silver is more important than gold.  Gold is used as a store of value.  Silver is used in everything we use in the electronic world.  Flat screen TVs, cell phones, computers, medical, solar panels.  And it was rigged.  And it was rigged.  And it was rigged by JP Morgan and friends.  We've been screaming it.  This is what I've been screaming about for 20 years.  And now it's coming to a head.  So please load up the truck in silver.  Physical silver in your own possession.  No SLV.  It's a bullshit derivative.  No COMEX futures.  It's a bullshit derivative.  No LBMA futures.  It's a bullshit derivative.  If it's not in your hand, it's a bullshit derivative.  no retirement accounts that hold the bullion for you, that's a bullshit derivative.  Because you don't own it.  You don't hold it.  I don't care if you trust the people who are holding it for you.  They're not going to care either.  When the shit falls down, the guards who are in front of that vault are going to walk in there and take care of their own families first.  You would too.  Get your metal in your own possession.  Repos, I just updated the repo chart for private road members and from Patreon.  Go check those out.  Yes, we are on track, but something big.  I thought would already happen by now, but it was just announced.  Statement regarding repurchase operations.  Open Market Training Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has released a schedule of repurchase agreements, operations for the monthly period of November 15th through December 12th.  In accordance with the most recent FOMC directive, the desk will continue to offer at least $35 billion in two-week repos and $120 billion in daily.  That didn't change.  Remember the Fed say, oh yeah, it's just temporary.  It's not temporary.  Those are permanent.  They might as well just do permanent because they're doing it every single day.  And every time a term repo matures, they do almost exact same amount for another term repo and sometimes more.  So that's a full-on bailout and they can't stop that ever.  But listen to this.  the desk will also offer three additional term repo operations during this calendar period with longer maturities than that extend past the end of 2019.  That is what they call a complete bailout.  It doesn't matter how long that term is.  When that term expires, they're going to flip it and do it again, just like they're doing with the two-week repos.  So now these are two-month repos.  These additional operations are intended to help offset the reserve effects of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities later this year and ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample during the period.  These are bank bailouts.  That's all they are.  The banks are in hell of trouble.  They are being destroyed and gutted with the derivatives.  So get ready for this chart to go exponential.  Right up here, right jumping up to the exponential line.  It'll be really interesting to see when they start doing this.  Because it's really going to make the chart jump.  And we're going to get up to that number.  The number is $700 billion in bailout.  Why?  Because that's what Congress approved in 2008.  $700 billion in bailouts.  But they had to go to Congress.  And the first time the bill went through Congress, it got rejected.  Stock market dropped 50% instantly.  It's going to happen again.  I can't tell you what date, but this is a huge sign again.  This is what three additional term repos.  That's what's going to really ramp things up.  And then they're going to announce, oh, and by the way, we have more and more and more bailouts.  And we have a new operation twist, operation twist.  Backflip, operation, everything you got.  All they are, they're the exact same thing.  They are bank bailouts.  The banks are dead and dying.  And the only thing Fed can do, we always knew it, the only thing they can do is print more money.  Print more money and rig the price of silver, rig the price of gold, rig the price of crypto.  That's all they can do.  That's all they got.  That's all they got left.  Go buy your silver.  Absolutely.  You should, if you have anything, if you can only pick one thing, it should be silver.  Why?  Because it's required.  It is necessary for our future.  You have a cell phone?  You're going to need silver.  And you're going to need a lot of it.  And the mining companies have been destroyed.  And most of the silver is above ground silver, or at least near the surface.  Gold, you can find gold down deep in the ground.  You can keep digging.  You'll find a lot of gold.  There's so much gold in the world.  It is dripping with gold.  The Grand Canyon gold, the Chocolate Mountain gold, Yamashita's gold, it's all real.  The gold bugs are completely clueless when it comes to saying, oh, there's 200,000 tons that's ever been mined in the world.  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  If you own any gold, you can get 86 ounces of silver for one ounce of gold.  That is insane.  Insane.  And you already saw me do my last ounce at, what, 80 to 1.  Now it's 86 to 1.  If you have gold, you're either delusional, deluding yourself, lazy because you don't want to go swap it, or you have some affinity to holding onto an asset that literally you've been lied about.  You agree that they rigged the markets.  You've been lied about the amount of gold in the world.  There's 10 to 20 times the amount of gold, meaning millions of tons of gold, not 200,000 tons.  And right now you can get 86 ounces of silver for every one ounce of gold.  If you own any gold, get rid of it now.  I'm not saying it's not going to go up in price.  It will.  But it won't come close to how high it's going to go, how high silver is going to go compared to gold.  Dump your gold for silver.  All right.  I got more tomorrow.  Yeah.  Go to RoadToRuda.com.
