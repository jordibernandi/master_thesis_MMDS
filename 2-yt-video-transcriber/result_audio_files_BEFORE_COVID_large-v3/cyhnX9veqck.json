            "text": "Hey, hello everybody.  Welcome to this new video final... Meld.  Okay, finally Transtastic is back and finally I am back.  If you don't remember me, my name is Adam.  I am now almost 23 years old.  I was on the channel like a year ago.  I was completely different.  I was living in Malaysia.  It was like a whole journey that I went to to get to where I am right now.  Since this is a re-intro video, so it's mostly like a life update, so I'm gonna let you know what I'm doing right now.  So ever since I moved to Canada, I'm like trying to readjust with a lot of things, you know, that's why I'm not like, I don't feel exactly as stable.  So I signed to a record label that is for trans artists and it's called Trans Trenders.  First of all, if you're gonna freak out, it's just a fucking name, calm down, okay?  And I've been performing.  I recorded a couple of songs.  I still have not released any.  So just stay tuned for that.  And I'm excited about the projects that we're working on because they're going to be a big of a deal and they're going to be like they're going to leave a trace in the trans history forever.  That's what I think.  otherwise mostly like my updates is just me trying to coexist with like the new environment that I'm around trying to meet people trying to make friends.  it has been a little hard a bit a lot but I'm working on it and I see a progress and I feel like I'm doing so much better.  as in for transtastic we took a break we reorganized things And we're coming back stronger than ever, more organized than ever.  And we have a lot of interesting topics that are going to be coming out.  So you guys need to stay tuned.  If you guys want to ask me anything, just, you know, comment or hit me up on Instagram or just, yeah, do that.  Because I know a lot of people have been like looking for me.  So let's stay in touch.  Hit me up.  I hope you guys are fine.  I want to know your updates too.  And I'll see you guys later.  Bye. ",
