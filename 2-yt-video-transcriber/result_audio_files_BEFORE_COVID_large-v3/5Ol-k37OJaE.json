            "text": "Hey guys, Radical here.  Got a video for you.  Now, if you pay close attention at the face of the cop, he is about to go Looney Tune on these guys.  But fortunately for these young men, there's a camera on.  That camera kept this cop from doing what he normally does, which is violate people's rights, brutalize people, whatever he does, because just looking at his face and his expressions, I can tell the type of person this cop is.  And I think cops all across this country are getting pretty aggravated with cameras, like that buffoon in Pritchard, Alabama.  You guys all saw that video, right?  You need to obey.  You need to obey.  That's what he said.  Well, it's Patrick Roth's video or Selena Carol's video, whichever one you want to watch.  You need to obey.  Obey?  Really?  Guys, you know, the civil exam to become a police officer is really easy.  I'm expecting.  But that cop there was hired through the buddy system or the family system.  Or the cousin or relative or something.  Because he's too damn stupid to be a cop.  Right?  Right?  You saw the video.  I saw the video.  And this cop here is a tyrant.  The cop in this video is a tyrant.  But fortunately this young man turned his camera on and that's what prevented something worse happening, right?  You know it, I know it, we all know it.  We have seen plenty of content and evidence that there are tyrannical cops out there.  The proof is there.  So go ahead and roll the clip. ",
