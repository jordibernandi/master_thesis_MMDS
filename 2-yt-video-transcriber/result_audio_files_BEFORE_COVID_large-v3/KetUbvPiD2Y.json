Sometimes, when Sir Sick is streaming, I have emotions that I don't know how to express with the words.  Also, I want a shiny plate to help me stand out from the plebs.  That's when I found memberships to Sir Six Whiskey Club, where you'll be awarded a sexy glass to show how special you are, and the ability to share emojis drawn by some woman that he sleeps with apparently, which is really cool.  Don't worry if you don't like whiskey, just pretend it's tea or something.  Sir Six Whiskey Club, we aren't better than you, we just think we are.  Thank you. ",
