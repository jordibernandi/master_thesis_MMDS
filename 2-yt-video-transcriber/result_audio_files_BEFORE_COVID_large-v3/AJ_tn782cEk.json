Y'all don't know what it's like.  We supposed to be the stronger, be protecting the queen.  But y'all ain't ever played chess.  Don't you know you're the king?  They call you racist if you're proud of your folks But they be mutin' you now if you forget about the holocaust.  Boots in the trenches at the back of the bus.  And Boots was in the streets when the brother got shot.  Now Boots know you got two strikes against ya One's because you're black And the other just for being a sister.  And how your man became the target of genocide.  Boots said she's livin' in the streets of apartheid.  She's taken from the cradle at an early age.  Victimized by sexual assault.  In the trenches at the back of the bus.  At least within the streets when the brother got shot.  I know you got two strikes against you.  One because you're black.  And the other just to be your sister.  And how your bitch became the target of genocide.  They need to sleep till the heart dies.  Make it from the cradle at an early age.  Victimized by sexual assault.  Boots was in the trenches at the back of the bus.  And Boots was in the streets when the brother got shot.  Now Boots, I know you got two strikes against you.  One's because you're black.  And the other just for being a sister.  And how you misbecame the targets of genocide.  Sex is living in the streets of apartheid.  Make it from the cradle at an early age.  Victimized by sexual assault.  One's because you're black and the other just for being a sister. ",
