The government was busy planning highways, and the first interstate section in St.  Paul would be built right through the heart of Rondeau.  And so, with little public outcry, block after neighborhood block was cleared to make room for the big road.  Hundreds of homes were condemned and torn down, including the house where Evelyn grew up.  At first, the road didn't really go anywhere.  It was just a ribbon of white dropped into St.  Paul's black neighborhood.  It would be years before the highway hooked up to the east or the west.  But finished or not, the highway had come.  There had never really been any hope of stopping it.  The neighborhood had to settle for one small victory.  The original plans called for the roadway to be elevated for much of the route through Rondeau.  After strong neighborhood protests about an elevated route, highway engineers agreed to put the highway in a sunken trench.  This is the warehouse at the Department of Transportation where files upon files are kept for the thousands of state residents who lost their homes for I-94.  Here in these files are the records of the 400 Rondo neighborhood homes that were torn down for the interstate.  Fully 300 of these homes belong to black households.  One of every eight blacks living in the city at the time lost a home to the freeway.  And each has a file in this room, including Evelyn.  Evelyn hadn't seen her house in 30 years before we uncovered photos of it stapled in her old highway department file. ",

The highway accelerated the changes going on in the neighborhood.  In 1950, most of the people in Evelyn's part of Rondeau were white.  By 1960, after the homes were cleared, most of the neighborhood was black.  Evelyn's old neighborhood is changing again.  It is still mostly black, but in the past several years, Southeast Asians have moved into the area and opened businesses in the neighborhood.  The city's fastest growing ethnic group, the Asians, now outnumber whites in some parts of Old Rondo.  But it is the black community that best remembers what Rondo once was. ",
