Link will be in the description box below.  As usual, go get it.  Excuse me, PayPal link.  They also asked me to put it up, so I'll put it up.  Thanks, everybody, for supporting.  This video is entitled, Why Men Are Abandoning the Protector and Provider Role.  I was listening to Emmitt Smith.  I think he was talking to Maverick Carter.  And Emmitt Smith was like, Maverick asked him, what would he buy?  no matter what?  He's like, really nothing.  Cheetos, maybe.  And Maverick was laughing.  And he said, well, you know, buying stuff makes, if you got to buy something to make you feel happy because most people buy things to make them feel happy, then that's a problem.  He was like, what he gets a joy out of is the big, the family moments, the birthdays, the events.  And he's seeing his family come together and he was able to use it, basically use his resources to have that.  That's where he gets his joy.  And I'm not going to lie to you, that is a great moment.  But for you people who, for you men who haven't had that, I hope that you'll be able to provide that, not only for your family and even your friends, but for yourself.  To see, you know, your work impact other people's lives.  Okay?  And especially the people that are close to you.  But... With all of these narratives running around, guys are abandoning the protective provider role because a person like Emmett Smith, not necessarily because he's rich, but the men who do that, they're not, if they want to do that, they're doing that for themselves now.  They're not really reaping the respect and the reverence that should come with things like that in America.  And people are acting entitled to them providing and protecting it.  And they're enjoying the provision and they're enjoying the protection, but they're being a complete jerks when receiving it.  So you get guys who are really abandoning quote unquote that role.  And one of the things is that a lot of people don't want to take into consideration.  is you know, guys don't want to do that for themselves.  You know, guys don't want to mess around and put their efforts out for people to disrespect.  You know, I was thinking about this when I saw Brian McKnight talking about his sons on Instagram, and he was very calm, very cool, and That's just his personality anyways, but when he was talking, he talked about everything he did and how he had to stop because protecting and providing for even his sons was enabling them and they weren't respectful of what he had done and his efforts of trying to put them on their feet.  And See, what I'm saying is it's not just men not doing it to women, you know, because Brian McKnight is the father of those two sons.  And part of the parenting issue comes in there because of divorce, family court, custody, child support, society viewing fathers as second-tier... parents or a secondary option.  and and that spills into marriage in a sense because the husband's role is basically to provide and protect for a wife and that's supposed to make her happy.  you know happy wife happy life like his life her life she's gonna.  it's kind of the undertone of that is she's gonna make his life hard.  if he doesn't do what it takes to make her life happy you get.  But he's getting up and out of it and guys are getting tired or not getting have gotten tired of that.  that response to that role.  So to a degree.  Guys are like abandoning ship as far as I don't need to protect and provide for you.  And of course you got to bring the elephant out of the room of quote unquote feminism.  And because I was listening, watching an old video today and one of my brothers had it on Instagram, Top Shocker.  Um, What a lady was talking, it was a women's panel on Fox News.  And one of the ladies was like, you know, we said we didn't need men, we were strong, we were independent, we could do stuff for ourselves.  And now the men are like, okay, fine.  And now it confuses the balance in the relationship between men and women and the dance that men and women have with each other.  because, you know, women wanted to be left alone, a quote-unquote, or the way they approach feminism says they wanted to be left alone.  And now God said bye.  So also because of that, you don't need to protect and provide if you don't need a man and you can get it on your own and you don't want chivalry and I can open my own door and I can pay my own bills and I can take care of myself.  Okay, cool.  No problem.  So guys like, well, I don't have to do that for you.  And then when guys are not doing this, it's like, why are you not doing it?  And I hate, you know, that we kind of play silly and play games and play stupid as if we weren't raised in an environment that said that girl could do whatever she want.  And where the young girls were saying, I don't need you.  When they were young girls, you ain't got to do this for me.  Well, let me back this up.  I saw the evolution of it.  Girls, when I was younger, loved... doing love.  guys doing things for him when I was younger and it evolved to them not wanting guys to do.  they love interacting with boys right.  they loved saying that this is my boyfriend I'm with him I like.  they love doing things for guys right or the guys they were with.  but I saw the deteriorate deterioration deterioration there you go of that over the years to the point where um These women don't actually, they have gone so far left that they don't even know how to do something for a man without feeling like it's a negative thing.  And so because, like I said earlier, these guys are abandoning it because there's no respect in doing things for anybody else.  So now, due to the feminism part of it, Guys are abandoning protecting and providing because, okay, there's nothing in it for me to protect and provide for you.  You know, basically protecting and provision is looked at as this is the extra stuff I get on top of being independent.  And I don't have to give much or if much.  Wait, no.  I don't have to give much, if anything, to this equation.  And guys are like, no, no, thank you.  Now, guys are abandoned, protected, and provisioned because some of these guys weren't raised to be protectors and providers.  Y'all say some of these kids were coddled or some of these kids were sabotaged by their parents or the school system or they weren't supported.  They weren't encouraged to better themselves.  Their educational journey wasn't supported.  So when people want them to be protectors and providers, they're like, why?  Nobody ever protected and provided for me.  I was just a tool to use, a pawn, somebody to disrespect, somebody to give the short under the stick.  But now you want me to turn around and give the world something that I never got?  Nothing to happen.  So that's why I said, you know, those guys are abandoning Protecting and providing.  And some guys were actually raised to be effeminized and effeminate and raised to be feminists.  And, you know, everybody's equal and everybody deserves this and everybody deserves that.  You took the go-getter, you stripped the go-getter mentality out of the boys.  So now when they're men, they're not go-getters.  They're not providers.  They're not protectors.  They abandoned doing that because they felt they were effeminized to the point where they felt it wasn't even their responsibility to be that as a man.  know not necessarily even protecting and providing for themselves because they.  they lack uh the instinct to protect themselves and to provide for themselves.  so uh so doing it for somebody else it's like why?  why would i do that?  this is why guys have abandoned that idea because people say they abandoned me and they abandoned the family.  i think uh, society and bad parenting has created men who abandon the protect and provide a world.  And now you want those very same men that you created to be protectors and providers for you.  Now that what you did didn't work, you know, and the guys ain't, you're not finna.  get those guys back to do it.  Not just not in my opinion.  I'm done.
