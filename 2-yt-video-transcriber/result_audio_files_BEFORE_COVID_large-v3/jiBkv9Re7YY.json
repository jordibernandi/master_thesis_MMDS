            "text": "Do not try anything you see or hear in this video.  Recharging disposable batteries is dangerous and I have to say that for a liability.  However, if you choose to do it on your own, it's completely your responsibility and you could save a lot of money doing so.  Now enjoy the rest of the video.  Alright ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Brightup and today I'm going to show you how to do something that some people consider extremely dangerous and that is recharging disposable D-cell or any cell batteries, okay, as long as they're not Lithium ones could actually combust and explode.  Now, I'm not a professional.  I don't get paid to do this, so I would suggest you contact somebody and wear proper protective equipment and all that kind of stuff before you think about doing anything like this.  I'm gonna try to recharge all these batteries.  Let's see, for the purposes of you guys out there, how dead these batteries are.  Okay so I'm going to turn the backlight on.  First we're going to start with the dura cells.  Now it's much safer and easier to charge these cells, larger cells, than it is smaller cells because smaller cells charge quicker and they blow up faster.  So this one's at 1.1 volt.  We're going to make sure it fits in our battery charger and it looks like This battery charger does not want to fit because there's a restriction right here.  I will tell you real quick, this works just fine for regular AAA and AA batteries.  I can stick them in here just fine.  And I can plug this into my USB power.  And it comes right up.  These are all products, by the way, that have been sent to me to review, including this battery tester.  All right, so it seems like this case was made specifically to keep D and C cell batteries out.  So my Dremel, however, was specifically designed to solve these problems.  So I cut out the plastic up here.  and down here, okay.  And I'm gonna go ahead and stick in the D cell.  These are the low, we tested these earlier and they were like, what was it, 1.1 volts or something.  There we go, now it's reading the batteries and it's seeing that they both need to be charged and it will charge them for a while again.  All right, so I've let these charge for almost 24 hours on the USB charger, and this isn't working, okay?  The reason is, is because with the D batteries, which this doesn't say it's for D batteries, okay?  It's hard to actually find a charger for real D batteries.  This is 1.2 volts while we're on the charger, okay?  Over here, we're 1.3.  And our goal is to get these charged up to 1.5 or very close to that so that we can use them reliably.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, so I think I finally got this figured out.  So the problem with the other battery charger, the USB one, is that modern rechargeable batteries are only supposed to charge up to 1.2 volts unless they have special contents.  And those chargers and those batteries are very hard to find.  what i got it?  i finally found my old battery charger my old ever ready battery charger.  i got it from surplus at a radio shack before radio shack stores started going out of business and whatever.  so here's here's the deal this one when i measured it it's putting 1.7 volts into each battery and i'll show you how it works.  let's get these dead batteries here and show you everything i learned so far.  it.  you put two cells into time.  okay like this, and these are the Rayovac.  Rayovac ones you can recharge.  I'm not saying it's safe.  I'm not saying try this at home.  I'm just saying that this works.  The Rayovac ones will recharge.  The Duracell ones also will recharge.  Now remember when I started with these, they were 800.8 volts, and we can charge them too.  I'll put them in here.  And the instructions for this and the lid says that when the red light's on, it's charging properly, okay?  And it's supplying, like I said, 1.7 volts across each battery, a total of 3.5 volts, or 3.4. depending on how you measure it, plenty.  Also, by having two batteries, there's more resistance, and I think that plays a key.  Because I tried building my own battery charger with a power supply, and it didn't like it.  It saw the batteries as a direct short.  By doing it this way, with two batteries, it provides more resistance, and that could be a key.  Now, energizers do not like to recharge.  It doesn't matter how charged or how drained they seem to be.  from my tests I've done so far.  Anytime you put energizer... batteries in the charger The light will not light up.  And they could have a built-in diode.  It could be part of the way they're built.  I don't know.  There's all kinds of things in here from batteries that have exploded in the past.  So the batteries do explode from time to time in these.  Now also, there's fumes that come off of this charger when you're charging non-rechargeable batteries.  And so you need to make sure that you have ventilation.  I opened a vent above here, and I'm planning on setting this up maybe in a cooler area outside.  It does say it gets warm.  There's places for heat to come out up here, and this is supposed to let it come out the top when you close the lid there.  See how that works?  All right, so I've let all these batteries charge for about two hours now.  And each hour, I have turned the whole machine off, disconnected these to check them, and I let them cool down.  They actually were warming up.  The whole system was warming up.  And I think it's good.  They also, I think the voltages stabilize and it recovers.  I think it's good for the batteries to let them have a break.  But this is amazing.  Remember, these start out, the Rayvax start out about 1 volt.  The Duracell started out at 0.8 volts.  Check out what we got right now.  This is pretty good.  Very impressed.  So these Duracells here are about 1.381 and they're gonna be the same because I tested them before I started to make sure I put the same voltages together and that is important for charging.  So these are about almost 1.4.  This one over here is 1.314.  So at this point, if we didn't want to push these Duracells to recharge anymore, we could use them.  Remember, rechargeable D-cells charge up to 1.2 volts.  Here's the Rayovacs.  The Rayovacs are almost completely back charged to 1.5 volts again.  Completely recharged.  Alright, so I am very impressed with the Rayovacs.  They are completely charged.  It's been, I believe, three hours of charging.  Could have been four, but I think it's three hours of charging.  And so here we go, 1.52 volts, 1.539.  So these guys are done.  We're not gonna charge them anymore.  We're just going to set them to the side and let them relax.  We could try to overcharge them, but why?  What's the point other than for likes on YouTube, right?  We might do that in another video.  Today we're just going to see what's possible without blowing up the batteries if we can get them back.  The Duracells, however, because they start out at 800.8 volts, right now we have 1.434 volts on that one.  This one here is 1.44, 1.3, and 1.4.  All right, so I finished charging these about 30 minutes ago.  Let's see if they held the charge.  This one's at 1.4 volts This one's a 1.476, 1.4, 1.460.  So the Duracell ones either take longer to charge or they just won't hold the charge.  These Rayvax, let's check them out again.  1,450.  So, So apparently the D cell batteries, when you recharge them back up to 1.5 volts, they don't like to hold the charge at 1.5 volts.  But I can get them recharged with this charger up to 1.5, and then they go down to about 1.45.  I call that a success.  I don't want to overcharge these again.  I could just leave these on the charger all night and then they might blow up or something.  I don't know.  These batteries here are $1 a piece when they're bought in bulk.  These batteries here are over $2 a piece when they're bought in bulk.  So, you know, technically we just saved, you know, being generous, of course, we saved, let's say, $2, $4, $6, $8.  nine ten dollars by recharging these six d cell batteries.  so anyways if you want to get a charger like this one you go down in the description of the video.  you should be able to find one you find on amazon or ebay.  and then of course these batteries charge faster.  but i will tell you that when I charge these batteries on the charger, the charger gets hotter, and I think those batteries have less resistance.  But according to all the stuff I've read and seen, they're supposed to last almost just as long as the Duracell.  So I'm not quite sure why they charge faster.  I'm also not sure why the battery that's on the bottom of the charger on the negative side charges slower than the side that's on the positive side.  But the key with these chargers is to get one, that's going to supply 1.7 volts to your battery while it's charging or 3.5 to both and that should help get them charged.  If you've got a smart charger that's going to shut off when the batteries get to 1.2 volts then you're only going to get them to 1.2 volts like we saw with the USB charger.  You need to make sure that your charger is capable of putting out power.  And again, this is not a smart charger.  It just stays on, and that's why it's able to charge these batteries so well.  It'd be interesting to see, and let me know in the comments if you want to see it, do a test with these and see what brand stays charged longer.  So we could take one of these that's recharged, and one of the... one of the Rayovac and stick them in devices and do a test and see which ones last longer.  That might maybe stick them in a flashlight or something.  I don't know.  But anyways, let me know what you want to see.  Thanks so much for watching the video.  God bless you.  Bye.
