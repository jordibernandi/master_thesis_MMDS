            "text": "What's up, what's up, y'all?  Listen, I know it's been a while, so I'm not going to keep y'all waiting.  I got a video for you.  I'm going to kind of preface it for you.  Couple walks of shame.  It's kind of funny here.  The other thing is, I had an officer threaten me and tell me that I'm lucky he's at work.  I'm guessing that meant that if he wasn't at work, he was going to fight me, which is, you know, how that goes, whatever.  And then I had another officer put his hands on me.  I kind of disregarded it.  You know, I don't really, whatever.  But I told him again.  You put your hands on me again, I'm going to defend myself and whoop your old ass because you have no reason to put your hands on me.  Then the other officer who threatened me about him being at work told me that he'd like to see me try it because it's three of them and one of me.  So I'm guessing he was ready to jump on me.  You know I didn't really care about that.  And then, secondly, well, thirdly, I told him two things.  Y'all put your hands on me, it's two things that's going to happen.  Lawsuit and I'm a whoop all y'all ass.  That's just how some go.  I'm fighting all three y'all right here right now.  I guess they thought I was playing but um, yeah, so I'm not gonna keep y'all waiting.  We gonna jump right into this video.  y'all stay tuned to the end.  We out.  So I'm out here at the Strom Thurmond federal building in Columbia, South Carolina and They just don't like filming.  So we're gonna see how it goes.  No, it's like I just got How you live?  There's a guy here.  Let's see what he got to say.  What's up, brother?  Who you work with?  I work for myself.  What you doing?  Nothing.  You recording?  Yeah.  You recording the building?  Yeah.  You can't do that.  I can.  What's your name?  Harold Jenkins?  Yeah.  That's your name?  What's your name?  Do you work here?  Yeah.  I'm not doing that.  So you work here?  Yeah.  Do you see that sign right there?  Before you waste whoever time you finna call, read that sign right there, okay?  Okay, that's all you have to say.  I'm done talking to you, brother.  So this sign here regulates what I'm doing, and he decided to come out and investigate anyway and waste everybody's time.  And now he's doing a walk of shame back where he's coming from.  I know it sucks coming out and not doing your job where you thought it was gonna go.  I'm sorry.  Maybe next time.  So as we speak, he's calling the local PD on me as we speak.  This is him here.  This is him.  You work for Homeland Security.  You don't?  You local PD around here?  Sheriff?  Security.  Oh, okay.  Got it.  Is he security as well?  So does he know that his jurisdiction stops where this sidewalk starts?  It's a public easement here.  Okay.  I appreciate it.  I was talking to him.  Our conversation has nothing to do with you.  You decided to move yourself from the conversation, so you stay down there.  i got more people coming out to talk to me.  oh this is gonna be great here.  i guess they thought i was supposed to run from him.  let's go let's go talk to him.  y'all know i don't run from any man.  let's go talk to him.  oh yeah but we're gonna keep it cordial.  I know, right?  As always.  How you doing?  How you doing, man?  I'm all right, brother.  What's your name?  Captain Moses.  How you doing?  I'm all right.  You videoing around the building?  I am.  Videoing around the building?  I am.  Can I see some ID?  You cannot.  Why?  Because, well, wait.  Do you or you?  So you're the first.  I want y'all to see this.  The first of Detection Corporation.  Don't put me on no camera.  I'm going to.  So your jurisdiction.  Stand fast.  No, you stand fast.  Oh, I'm not going nowhere.  Oh, wait.  Tell me about it.  Y'all can't detain me out here.  I've done no.  I've committed no crime.  Oh, so you told me to stand fast.  Ain't nobody detain you.  So I can leave, right?  No, you can't leave.  So if I can't leave, that means I'm being detained.  Can you articulate the crime?  Man, I'll call you back.  Yeah, call them back, please.  Man, I'll talk to whoever I want to out here.  What?  I'm busy right now.  Yeah, he real busy.  And he's going to be a whole lot busy at home, jobless, if he don't tell me that I can leave.  Wait, he got to wait.  I'm doing something else real important right now.  Just tell the guy to wait.  It ain't that important.  All right.  So you have no jurisdiction over this public easement, and you're going to tell me that I can't stand here?  I mean, that I got to stand here, I can't leave?  I think you got your job title all backwards.  You're the type of officer that my attorney will have fun with.  Boy, look, I'm at work.  You say I'm looking at work?  That's what I said.  Are you threatening me?  I'm not threatening you.  Are you threatening me?  I ain't threatening you.  I'm talking to you.  If you that big of a guy, take your badge off.  You ain't talking to me.  Don't threaten me and tell me that I'm looking at work, buddy.  You ain't talking to me.  Don't tell me I'm lucky you at work.  You ain't talking to me, sir.  Yeah, okay.  Because you barking up the wrong tree.  You ain't talking to me.  Well, I am.  I'm talking to you.  I hit dog a hollow on it.  Yeah.  Going to tell me.  No.  He going to tell me I'm lucky you at work because you got a badge and a gun on his hip.  Like, they the only ones that carry guns.  That dude don't bother me.  Call who you going to call, please.  Yeah, I know.  I'm free to go, but I kind of want to stay here now because he's going to tell me I'm lucky here at work.  I keep going to do something to me.  Can both of y'all come to the back of the building ASAP, please?  At the back of the employee entrance outside.  Boy, this Joe lost his mind.  All right.  Yeah, I know, right?  He told me I was lucky here at work.  That's a threat on my safety.  Supreme Court's already ruled that illegal detention and arrest can be and will be resisted.  Yeah, so we're gonna continue walking up and down this sidewalk here.  I'm gonna slide by you here, brother.  Pardon me.  I hate to.  Excuse me, sir.  Hold on, hold on.  Sir, don't touch me.  That's an assault.  That's an assault.  You just put your hands on me.  You just put your hands on me.  That's an assault.  I hope you know that, and I got it on camera.  You just put your hands on me unwarrantly.  That's an assault.  I'm going to walk here.  If you put your hands on me again, I will defend myself because you have no legal reason to touch me.  I've committed no crime.  I've broken no law.  This is a public easement.  I can walk here as long as I want to, okay?  Please do not put your hands on me.  That is a legal activity.  Read the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has already ruled that federal installation.  Okay, well, I'm going to walk this way.  All you have to do is just answer the question.  I don't have to answer any questions.  The Supreme Court does not say, hey, answer their questions and you can do what the Constitution says you can do.  That's not how this works.  You'd like to see me defend myself? ",
