One other main one I would like to tell you real quick is the fact that The LDS Church teaches that Jesus was created by God in the pre-existence, and He also got to deity a little bit quicker than those who were in the pre-existence with the rest of His spirit brothers and sisters.  But the Bible actually says in John 1.1, in the beginning was the Word, the Logos, and that's referring to Jesus.  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  And then also Colossians 1 says, all things through Him and by Him and for Him, that He's the Creator.  And He says also in parts of John's Gospel, He says, before Abraham was even there, He says, I am.  He says the word ego ami, which means I am, which if you refer back to the Exodus burning bush, God calls it, He says, what's your name?  Should I tell them I am?  I am that I am.  Jesus says, I am God. ",

            "text": "No, we believe that that was the Father, but that Jesus is God.  We believe in what's called the Trinity.  I know you've heard of it when you were at the Baptist Church.  So Jesus is God, but Jesus is not the Father.  The Father is God, but the Father is not the Holy Spirit.  And the Holy Spirit is God, but He's not... Yeah, yeah.  So basically what we're trying to get at is a Jesus that's created, whereas in the Christian church we're saying He's uncreated.  He says, I'm the Alpha and the Omega.  I have no beginning.  I have no end.  I've been God.  From all eternity, He says, I'm the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world.  He is eternal.  He is God.  That only God Himself could absorb the wrath of the Father on that cross.  So if Jesus was once a man, then He could not take the wrath of the Father and be a propitionary atonement for you, for me, for anyone.  So based off of those things, Jesus was created.  And then you could become a God.  Galatians 1 warns about that.  Galatians 1 says that's a different Gospel.  He says if anyone comes like us or an angel from heaven and they preach a Gospel contrary to the one that we've preached to you, they are to be accursed.  And so we take that and we go, oh my goodness, these are sweet people.  These are beautiful people.  People that I would love to take into my home and care for.  Because they believe in a fundamentally different gospel.  We look at all those things.  We look at Deuteronomy 18, the test of a prophet.  Many of Joseph Smith's prophecies have failed to come to pass.  And so God says when a prophet does not, when he prophesies of something and doesn't come to pass, you are not to listen to him.  So there's just so many inconsistencies. ",

He says the first principle of the gospel is to understand the nature and deity of God.  He says, you have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity, but I will refute that idea and take away the veil that you may see.  You have got to learn to become God.  At that moment in time when Joseph Smith said that, he contradicted everything Orthodox Christianity has ever taught.  In Psalm 90 verse 2, it says God is God from everlasting into everlasting.  And I want to submit to you in Deuteronomy 13, another test of a prophet, It says that if a prophet or a dreamer of dreams comes around you, produces miracles, signs and wonders, even if it looks legit, but they lead you after another.
