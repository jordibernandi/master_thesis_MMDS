This is your brother Malcolm from the branch of the Great Millstone here in Chicago, coming at you with another lesson.  And as you can see, this trade war, this economic war is going back and forth between America and China, now Iran and America.  You know, Esau is trying to rally other Edomites, the European countries, other Edomite European countries to his call.  And a lot of people just aren't with it.  So I'm going to let a bit of this video play and bring out some bullet points on some different things that are happening in the world.  All effect in America is going to really affect the pockets of everyone.  Could definitely bring on some riots and famine and crash of the dollar.  And all these things are leading up to the chip in World War III.  And of course, JT.  JT meaning Jacob's Trouble.  You know, those race riots.  Watch the video today with Dave Hodges, you know, and Lisa.  What's her name?  Lisa Haven.  talking about, you know, the race baiting in America.  No, it's not race baiting.  It's just, it's that time.  But without any further ado, let's let a little bit of this video play and then we'll go into the scriptures. ",

Trying to keep the petrodollar.  In a position.  Where it is the reserve currency.  Of the earth.  And is fastly losing that.  That status actually is pretty much done.  It won't be much longer before that one straw just breaks the camel back.  You know, that one little spark is going to start those fires.  The fire of destruction.

            "text": "So, you know, when you look at the whole matter, the British backed off and let the Iranian ship go.  This is Obadiah, verse 2.  Actually, I'm going to start at verse 1 and read down to 4.  It says, The vision of Obadiah thus saith Jehovah power concerning Edom.  We have heard a rumor from Jehovah, an ambassador is sit among the heathen.  Arise, and let us rise up against her in battle.  All right, and when you do your research, there was an ambassador.  And that ambassador was Abdul Qabal Nasser, who was the president of Egypt in 1951.  And he said publicly on national TV, even though he said it in Arabic.  You know, he did say it in Arabic.  And I actually had a Jordanian guy that I used to work with.  All right, he used to own the gym that I trained all my clients out of years ago.  He actually translated the video for me because it used to be on YouTube.  Every time somebody puts it up, they take it down.  But Abdul-Gabal Nasser says something to the effect, speaking to the Jewish people, the Israelis, that he said, you will never have peace in this land for you left your black and came back white.  Who are you people?  You know, roughly paraphrase.  He may have he also may have added something in every piece will never accept you because you left black and came back white.  And then he questioned, who are you people?  All right.  This was said by the by a president of the president of Egypt at the time on national TV in 1951.  All right.  So that footage is out there.  They can keep pulling it down off the Internet, you know, every time it goes up.  But they can't.  But that that's they can't stop.  That's a part of history now.  Question that they don't like to deal with.  You know, they just trying to sweep that under the rug, pretend it didn't happen.  But continuing in Obadiah, it says, The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the cleft of the rock, whose habitation is high, that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down?  Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, thou settest thy nest among the stars, this will I bring thee down, saith Jehovah.  And he did, because these people that were once with him, are no longer with them.  The nations are pulling away from Esau-Edom, right?  Esau-Edom is pulling away from each other.  Nations are pulling away.  The beast is pulling away from Babylon, from America, all right?  You got now Russia and, not Russia, but Germany and France have pulled away from the EU and now have joined together, even joined their armies together, the same as Russia and China which Korea is going to join into them, more than likely India and Pakistan.  And every place that I just named are all nuclear-powered places.  All right?  And the list, and eventually Britain is going to turn on America. ",

            "text": "You can clearly see that, you know, these are the prophecies in the Bible, the things that are happening, man.  As we're getting closer and closer to that day, prices for food is skyrocketing.  Gas is up.  You know?  The Dow is falling.  All right.  U.S.  Steel is laying off.  You know, because because of a low demand.  All right.  So, you know, let's get a scripture on that.  This is a. Ecclesiastes 12.  Three and four, and it reads, and in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few.  And those that look out of the windows be darkened, all right?  So there's going to be few jobs, all right?  And they look out the windows and the windows mean their future.  They don't see a future.  People are getting, that's why so many suicides and things of that nature, man.  You know, a lot of, they got cop suicides all over the country because they know what's coming, all right?  The opioid crisis, the drug crisis, heroin, heroin, meth and opioids that are wiping out Americans, mainly Edomite Americans.  They're the main ones.  All right.  Verse four, and the door shall be shut in the streets.  And when the sound of the grinding is low and look at all the store closures and a closed up storefront and the thousands in the tens of thousands of stores that have shut down.  And probably the in the hundreds of thousands and millions of people who are off work as a result of that.  Okay It says and the sound of the grinding is low He shall rise up at the voice of the bird.  you get up early in the morning To get on your computer and fill out applications or go into places and fill out applications, but there's no work.  All right, he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and And all the daughters of music shall be brought low.  And music is at its all time lowest.  It really is.  All right.  What else is going on?  Oh, to add fuel to that fire of the jobs and the lack of jobs.  Amazon has been using those trucks.  If you saw that movie, Logan, you know, in that movie, Logan, they showed you all these trucks that were automated.  You know, trucks that had no drivers, man.  Driving up and down the expressway.  Well, guess what?  That wasn't just a movie.  That's real.  It was already happening.  Alright?  So, all these people that are truck drivers or getting ready to become truck drivers, this is not going to be work for you much longer.  I also heard about how in Hayward, California, actually I lived in Hayward for quite a few years.  I heard Hayward's really not as nice as it used to be from what I've been told.  But Hayward was actually kind of decent.  But, um, Those parking lots have little robots that patrol them to protect the cars.  And how one of these robots was attacked by an assailant.  And he knocked the robot over, but the robot took all kind of pictures of him.  So now he cold busted.  So now you're looking at security jobs.  The grinding is low, man.  The future is not looking good for America.  All right?  This is Ecclesiastes 3 and 3.  Actually, I'm going to start at verse two.  I'm going to start at verse one.  And it says to everything, there is a season and every time and every purpose under heaven.  All right.  And the purpose of Esau was to destroy the earth.  The scriptures clearly said that the earth was was defiled of the inhabitants thereof.  Matter of fact, let me go ahead and grab that.  Then I go back to.  Yeah, Revelations 11 and 18, and the nations were angry, and they are.  That's why America's being called an economic terror.  Hey, America has committed more terrorist acts than any... I mean, it just is what it is, man.  All right?  When you can drop bombs on people and bomb people and shoot their planes out the air and never even apologize for it, have your troops storming around on other people's lands... And they can't do anything about it.  That's imperialism.  That's just acts of terrorists, man.  Just because these people don't want to use your currency.  If you notice, America only goes to nations who don't have a central bank in them.  Which is owned by the Rothschilds.  The Ishes.  Alright?  Revelation 11 and 18.  And the nations were angry and thy wrath has come in the time of the dead.  and they that should be judged.  And so it's time for judgment.  It's time for judgment of the wicked Israelites, of all the heathen round about, and especially the nation of Esau, Edom, because they have totally defiled the earth.  The bees are dying.  I saw a report this morning that said the world, the woodlands of the world, the woodlands around the world are on fire worldwide.  Worldwide Amazon I think what they say 700,000 acres or something like that some 73 million acres and some Absurd crazy number, but it says that the woodlands are on fire worldwide.  So on every continent all throughout Europe fires are burning in forests, man All right, we don't get a scripture on that too.  but it says uh Let me start the top again and the nations were angry and thy wrath has come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and And thou should give us reward unto thy servants, the prophets and the saints, because they only have highways and byways doing this work.  You know, not these infiltrated groups that Esau has planted.  You know, which there's plenty of them out there pulling up on people.  All right.  And it says, and the saints.  So the prophets and the saints are going to get their reward.  And the fear of thy name, small and great, and shouldest... Destroy them, which destroy the earth.  So the destroyers of the earth, man, the bees are dying.  Why?  Because of Esau Edom, man.  Esau Edom is a plague, like in that series of 100.  If you haven't watched it, check it out.  The character Clark is a representation of Esau Edom.  And they call her Wanheda, which basically means the bringer of death, man.  Esau truly is Wanheda.  All right?  It's funny.  That sounds almost like a Gadite word.  It almost sounds like Hebrew.  But they truly are one hitter.  They are the bringers of death, the masters of death.  Revelation 6 and 4 says, And there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and they should kill one another.  And there was given unto him a great sword.  Esau's blessing was a sword.  His weaponry.  And his ultimate weapons has been nuclear weapons.  But he's got lasers and all types of weapons, man.  Right?  The modern day sword is the gun.  All right?  They got guns that can shoot around corners and all manner of things, man.  All right?  This truly, Esau truly is the harbinger of death.  One hitter.  All right?  Yeah, World War III is definitely on the horizon, man.  Okay?  You got China got slapsations on the U.S.  over Taiwan arms sales.  So now you got, you know, the U.S.  trying to arm Taiwan.  Creating what?  Dissension.  Because Taiwan was a part of China, man.  That's over there in that land.  What if China was trying to control Oklahoma or a city in Kentucky or in Texas or something?  That's basically the equivalent of what Esau has done with Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Those are lands, that's their people.  Okay?  But let's go to Isaiah 29th chapter, all right?  About those forests that are burning and those bees that are dying, right?  So we're looking at famine because the bees pollinate everything, man.  We need the trees and the plants just to breathe.  They pollinate the trees and the plants and the food sources.  So if you got billions of billions of bees dying all over the world, man, that's a hey, there's some serious dark days that are close at hand, man.  All right.  But this is Isaiah 29 and six, and it reads, thou shalt be visited of the how of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise and storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire.  There's been fires all over the U.S.  in the recent years.  And now there are fires burning all over the world as the banks are panicking, as the Dow is dropping, as we get closer and closer to what the world ignorantly calls the apocalypse.  All right?  Because it's coming.  It's the end of Esau's world and the beginning of Jacob's.  Ko holo ye hao ba shi la ba shae ba shi mo kakwa dash wa ba ba ba. ",
