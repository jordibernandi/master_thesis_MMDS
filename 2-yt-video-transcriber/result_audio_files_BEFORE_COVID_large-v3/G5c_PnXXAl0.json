I decided to take a break because I was hungry.  Rice cakes.  Gonna record this guy into this guy.  He's a bit gay.  So what you have to do when you doubt yourself is always keep a tab open of your queen.  synthesizers very very dramatic.  so i don't know if what i'm doing is legal.  um really hope i don't get sued by hosier for this.

I don't want to wear glitter.  I want to cry.  When you start doubting yourself, even if what you're making is already a remix of something else, remix it again.  If you're not happy with it, change it.  This song is getting more and more emotional, dark, and depressing.  I love it.  I just recorded this very simple two-note bass line.  I tried to record myself doing it, but I accidentally recorded my foot.  This is our current Google search after, you know, all the other very important searches.  Cover songs are in a tricky place, legally.  We have a loophole. ",
