At this point we all know Flat Earthers are the biggest idiots on the planet because if they aren't then they're the biggest liars on the planet.  Gizem knows the Earth is curved.  He proved it.  Bob Nadell knows the Earth spins.  He proved it.  There's been so much irrefutable evidence that shows the Earth to be a sphere.  So the people still clinging on to this joke of a movement are being shown for the people they really are.  And that's people that are dependent on the flat earth, whether to line their pockets or to make them feel special.  So today I'm joined by Schrodinger's cat to tackle a Flurf who seems as big a conman as he is an idiot.  This is episode 12 of Flurfs are Idiots, the Morgile.  We're living on a disk floating through space with a tiny sun.  So, what has this particular moron got for us?  Well, he thinks Rivers disproved the globe.  Let's all point and laugh.  Yes, John the Morgile.  I'm sure we will enjoy watching you be a complete and utter moron.  I predict you won't say a single relevant thing but act like you're making some massive revelation. ",

But I got one call, my wife answered and they hung up.  And then a few minutes later I got another call and they said, and I'll mock the voice, they said, we do not approve of the book.  Click.  And the number here, That's my caller ID.  It's backwards.  It's 202-358-0001.  And so I did a reverse.  I looked online for the number, and it's a NASA-affiliated number.  So I'd really like to know, within five minutes of posting this video promoting my book, why is NASA calling me telling me they don't approve of it?  Well, guess what, NASA?  I don't approve of your fucking lies.  I don't approve of you ripping off $20 billion a year from taxpayers.  What are you going to do to me?  Are you going to kill me if I do this book?  I don't care.  We're all going to die someday.  I don't care if you kill me or threaten me.  I'm going to do the book.  So quit calling.  I don't approve of NASA's lies and raping people for $20 billion a year just in tax dollars.  It's not going to stop me. ",

But as for that $20 billion thing, I think we need to go to the remedial classroom.  Okay everyone, settle down, today it's some basic maths.  Yes, Mr.  Riley, sorry Riley, what is it this time?  Everyone's being mean to you in your comments section.  Well, that's because every video upload makes people want to either laugh at you or punch you.  But don't be sad, the good news is you're probably finally going to get that dumb fuck of the year award.  You're trying really hard, and rightly so after two second places in a row.  So today we're going to look at NASA's budget compared to the US budget.  In 2018 the US federal budget was $4.094 trillion.  NASA's budget for 2018 was $19.1 billion.  That is 0.464% of the federal budget and it was reduced by 1% from the year before.  So that was very basic class, do you understand?  Yes Mr Riley?  No there is no independent variable in NASA's budget.  What do you mean, then, how can I prove it?  Please go home.  Yeah, I know it's not home time yet, but you're too stupid and there's no hope for you.  And that's all we have time for today.  Thanks for watching.
