And then after that, we have video of some of the craziest square lightning.  I mean, like this is straight up a due energy thing from space.  And we have these crazy cloud formation.  You're not even going to believe it.  I was thinking this is absolutely crazy.  If you have never been here before, this is Marfugal TV.  I am Adam, aka Marf, and this is a call-in show.  So you will get an opportunity to call the number that is scrolling down below and give us your opinion on some of the hottest stories that are out right now.  We go over some mainstream articles and then you give your opinions on them.  Now, obviously, some of these stories are exactly that stories, but some of them have a good amount of truth in them.  So we are trying to collectively get through the BS and get to the truth.  Now, this is really crazy what is going on here.  So I want to give a lot of big credit to the YouTubers that are about to be featured.  They are in the Fugle fam.  And I'm going to go through this.  I wanted to let everybody know, of course, now we have the East Coast obviously preparing for something.  After that video aired, which by the way, we put out the shortened clip on to Marfugle News, which is now over 30,000, I think over 35,000 views in just a few hours.  It's like five hours old.  And that video, we have gotten so many different emails from so many different people that work in the power industry and they're all saying that she is 100% correct.  That they are ordering like crazy, working all crazy hours through the night, so what the heck is really going on?  Now, there are some other things that have been happening that are very weird.  Now... This, what is on your screen right now, this is NextRad.  And this is actually showing some RF radiation type things.  I'm going to let Homegrown USA take it from here.  And then after that, we have video of some of the craziest square lightning.  I mean, like this is straight up a due energy thing from space.  And we have these crazy cloud formation.  You're not even going to believe it.  I was thinking this is absolutely crazy.  And then later on, we're going to be talking about a video that arguably I don't even know what to say about it.  And then we are going to be going through what is actually going on right now.  We've got news out of China.  We've got news out of everywhere right now.  I mean, this is one of the days where it's a goldmine for someone who does.  news like this is insane.  So I'm going to get in.  I'm going to play this video.  I'm going to shut my voice off right quick and then let you guys watch this.  I'm telling you guys this.  I was sitting there the whole time like, holy moly, what is this?  And it starts out a little bit slow.  Homegrown USA did an amazing job spotting this and I believe they are related.  Just watch. ",

If you look in Nevada here, there's KLRX and it sits right here, right here in the top of the state, right dead smack in the middle.  And I'm pretty sure that's what that is.  But that is cranked up 100% all the way, you know.  And all the other, everything else is quiet in the country.  So if you look across the entire country.  So what's going on in Nevada?  Are the birds dying?  You know, these frequencies are horrible.  So I wanted to bring that to your attention, show you a couple maps.  The rest of the country looks quite fine, except for, well, we got a lot of rain coming for Pennsylvania here.  But let me just hop through these real quick just to show you.  There that is up close.  But even if we unzoom it, look at this craziness.  So if anybody's in Nevada... this area please comment below.  or if anybody knows anything about this because the only thing I can do is my assumption takes me to here which is the Doppler NEXRAD system and we all know that those circles are these circles.

And I have never seen this weird stuff.  You can see there's three streaks here before.  they're about five.  I've got it in my stills.  I mean, that's just weird.  Okay, what in the hell makes it spiral like that?  Look it, it's almost you can see a different color blue.  There's clouds and there's not clouds.  That's freaky.  Look at it.  It's almost like a laser, but it's not.  It's, it's, it's, I mean, it's a, I got polarized sunglasses on.  Oh no, I don't.  I took them off.  I have my bifocals on.  And that blue where the ray is, is a very deep blue.  And then next to it, it's cloudy.  So it looks like it's cutting through the clouds. ",

Let's see.  Okay.  First off, this whole sky thing, that's the opposite direction of the sun.  Nothing makes sense here.  Like, nothing.  And then this lightning... This is from just a regular, a regular member as far as our group goes.  This is not, you know, this is, this is insanity.  That looks like it's coming from space.  Some could argue God.  I'm telling you there is something way bigger and we don't know what's going on.  And I believe the other countries have incredibly advanced super weapons that are being worked on right now.  And directed energy is literally the new thing.  So as far as what was just showed there, that's insane.  I hope people are understanding.  Things are changing right in front of our eyes, and we're going to see things that we wouldn't even imagine ever happening.  And having all of these people confirm that the East Coast, and from what I hear, the West Coast as well, is preparing for some sort of massive power event, some sort of power surge, whatever it is, they are going triple, double time, freaking all night, every day.  I heard at least five weeks.  So whatever is going on, it's definitely ramping up.  And the general public, we're just not going to be filled in.  Not until it's too late. ",
