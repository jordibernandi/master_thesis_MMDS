            "text": "What's going on, everyone?  Jeremy here from The Quartering, and hey, if you're new to the channel, please don't take this production quality as my normal.  I'm traveling, just trying to keep the subscribers informed of everything that's going on.  And if you're an existing subscriber, I do apologize for the drop in quality.  I'm doing the best I can with the limited equipment, being snowed in in a snowbank.  But I do hope that you appreciate the effort.  And if you do, please remember to like the video and hopefully we'll just make it through all this and we'll be back to normal quality soon.  So a lot, a lot of news around Captain Marvel has been dropping and not all of it is that good.  So Monday, late Monday or Tuesday, it was actually reported that Captain Marvel saw a massive box office drop.  Now, a lot of you, a lot of you Captain Marvel apologists, I know I've picked up a lot of people that are continuously downvoting.  Whenever I cover Captain Marvel, this one's for you.  I'm going to kind of debunk this a little bit.  It was a big box office drop, nearly 72%.  when you saw films like Batman vs.  Superman only dropping 55% from Sunday to Monday.  But this is the time of year.  It's a spring release.  I don't know if everyone's really on spring break.  They are by me.  But, you know, the 71.6% Monday drop for Captain Marvel is comparable to Guardians of the Galaxy 2, which saw 74.8% for its first Monday, yet the James Gunn flick still went on to make $863 million worldwide.  I think this drop... in a lot of ways, is Much Ado About Nothing.  It's an interesting click-baity thing to put in the title.  But when you look at some of the other films that had similar drops, you know, Rogue One, you know, that one was 53.3%, but that was Summer, The Dark Knight, The Hunger Games.  All these movies made tons of money.  And then when you look at what they did on Tuesday, because of discount tickets, with Monday seeing a ticket drop of... Over 71% Tuesday, they picked up a bit with $14.6 million in sales, a bump of 27%.  Actual number, $14.6 million.  Captain Marvel now has a domestic box office of about $180 million through yesterday with global haul of $524 million.  Now, a lot of people were throwing around numbers, their break-even number.  And with the budget being out, I think we know some people were talking about needing $750 million to break even.  That's not necessarily... And then they were making the comparison that the budget was $750 million.  The reality is in the cinema, the studio only gets a percentage of the money from box office.  Now... I don't know what the actual percentage is, but I do know it's less globally than it is domestically, I believe, or I might be flipping those.  So let's say if you had, you're running with a $750 million breakeven number, that would actually, let's say that they get 50%, right?  So that means if they're saying, hey, we're going to break the, you know, That puts the real budget between three and $400 million, which is what we're seeing.  They haven't actually put it out officially, but what we know is it's about 200 million, and I'm guessing usually films have a budget of similar to that exact same amount for marketing.  So $400 million is probably where this film is at.  So the article everyone was talking about is actually this Captain Marvel cashes in, $14 million on Tuesday, the second best in March.  I mean, there's any way to say this film is doing the best, right?  So the line reads, Nancy reported Captain Marvel yesterday.  Disney says Wonder Woman is up to $524 million.  One film finance source believes it's pretty much certain that Captain Marvel will see the $1 billion around the world and break the glass ceiling for female-led pics in the global box office.  I don't know if you could really say that there's a... glass ceiling in female-led films.  That is obviously a lie, but regardless, I'm dashing past Wonder Woman's final global of $821 million.  It's funny how they're like totally diminishing.  Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman.  It's like they're saying the film never existed or none of the alien films ever existed or Sarah Connor never existed.  You know how Marvel likes to retcon?  Well, the media likes to retcon history as well.  So this is a line that got everyone buzzing.  Domestic will be at $400 million.  Captain Marvel will pass break-even in theatrical window by the end of the week with $750 million worldwide.  So if we know, if we say, okay, well, let's say they take 50% of that, you know, that puts it at $375 million total budget, which is kind of on par with what we know about Captain Marvel.  Although, huge push today, probably from the Avengers Endgame trailer dropping.  That was, of course, on purpose.  We also saw, though, that in the New York Times yesterday, Rotten Tomatoes actually finally admitted that they indeed pushed the want-to-see change out to protect Captain Marvel, something we all knew.  One audience reviewed or deemed a movie a complete disaster.  Another was tired of all SGW nonsense.  Using the abbreviation for social justice warriors, a pejorative term for progressives, not all progressives, just crazy ones.  Yet another grouse at Brie Larson's, the movie star, said, I shouldn't see the movie anyway.  Again, these are people's opinions.  Just because you disagree with them doesn't make them wrong, doesn't make them invalid.  Most critically... So it's opening with But Not Before.  Rotten Tomatoes, an influential site where bad audience scores can damage a film's prospects, made major changes to its rules.  It also stopped displaying the percentage of moviegoers who say they want to see a film in favor of using raw number of people and removed the not interested button.  We're doing it more accurately and authentically represent the voice of the fans.  No, you're not.  While protecting our data and public forums from bad actors.  The backlash against Captain Marvel resulted from a collision of two major forces.  One was the popularity of the websites that at their best democratize the reviewing of movies.  Restaurants and businesses at their worst can be weaponized for score-settling or political grudges.  Captain Marvel is among the first few superhero films to star a woman, but a bigger trigger factor is the film's haters appear to be Brie Larson's outspokenness, I mean wokeness, from the lack of diversity in movies.  Yeah, okay, fine.  This all provided fodder for trolls.  I mean, people who disagree, right?  Anyone who disagrees is a troll.  And the percentage was as low as 27%.  The Tomatometer, which analyzes the film ratings from film critics at a certified fresh 79, slightly below the average for Marvel films.  It's impossible to say whether the website's changes helped the film, but it made $456 million during opening weekend trouncing projections.  You know, it's... You know, you had... Everybody basically working together.  Some sites pushed back.  Rotten Tomatoes said it would delete comments posted from members of a Facebook group down with Disney's treatment of the franchise and fanboys.  I mean, you have them coming out.  Two and a half months later, Rotten Tomatoes threw in with Miss Larson's cause and revamped its criteria for critics, focusing on individual qualifications more than brand.  It also pledged $100,000 to festivals, blah, blah, blah.  A representative for Rotten Tomatoes, Dana Benson, said the change to its audience score had been in the works for a while, but that the attacks on Captain Marvel prompted them to roll it out earlier than planned.  Yeah, right.  It's still not working properly, but you notice... user ratings now up to 63%.  interesting right interesting.  this was in the 30s for a very long time and you know my review of the film which was deleted and many of your reviews.  I wonder if everyone went and left another fair review of what they thought of the film if it would actually get counted or if they're still actively moderate moderating that.  but now we're actually seeing even more craziness coming from rotten, I'm sorry, reports of Disney essentially buying tickets and also the pre-apologizing already happening for week two of Captain Marvel.  New reports of empty theaters at Captain Marvel add to movies controversy.  New reports of empty theaters.  A number of Twitter users indicated that there were empty seats at a number of Captain Marvel showings over the weekend.  The Captain Marvel report from my local theater is shocking.  Out of 22 showings on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, there were 570 empty seats from advanced ticket buyers who never showed up.  While on Sunday, there were only four no-show movies for the movie all day.  Now, this is fueling rumors that Disney purchased pre-purchase tickets to inflate the opening weekend box office.  I mean, you know, that would be a huge stretch in my opinion.  but not totally impossible.  In fact, it's not, basically you have shill bidding, right?  You inflate those weekend numbers, the opening weekend to build hype.  It's a marketing budget expense.  I could absolutely see that happening.  My theater manager friend said Thursday night, Friday night, and Saturday night, a great many Captain Marvel advanced seat buyers never show up for the movie.  20 to 30 seats were empty at each showing despite being sold out.  Now that is truly interesting.  The manager claimed he'd never seen anything like it in 20 years.  Hundreds and hundreds of tickets were purchased online, but the buyers never arrived to watch the film.  As far as I remember, the box office totals for Captain Marvel are fake, with Disney or a partner padding these numbers.  I went Thursday night.  The theater was a little over half full.  Captain Marvel empty.  Here's a local theater.  Friday night before 10.20 Captain Marvel showing.  Totally empty.  What is going on?  We spoke with a movie theater manager who asked for anonymity.  He told us that exactly 25 no-shows of every showing of Captain Marvel Thursday through Saturday.  The manager told us this was definitely abnormal, definitely not normal.  People usually show up when they pay us for tickets.  I'm not sure what's going on.  We've seen big groups not show up before, but they get refunds.  I asked whether or not these tickets were purchased in bulk, but that information isn't available.  I'm not sure they were all bought at once because Fandango doesn't give us that information, but exactly 25 no-shows for every show is probably statistically impossible.  The manager would add, I would say there's someone trying to make ticket sales look better than they really were.  He would also indicate he saw significant drop-offs in ticket sales from Sunday at his theater.  Sunday for Captain Marvel wasn't good, and Monday and Tuesday were terrible.  They were at like a 75% drop-off from Sunday.  Now, this is just one theater, but we can already see some of everyone's favorite trolls, Scott Mendelsohn, coming out and saying, Captain Marvel tops 550 and thus can't afford a big second weekend drop.  That's hilarious.  It's like... I'm going to pre-apologize for a bad weekend.  With $8.6 million on Wednesday, a frankly sharp 41% drop from its previous $14.6 million Tuesday gross.  But remember, Tuesday tickets are generally discounted.  has now earned $187 million in six days of domestic.  To be fair, the Jungle Book dropped 34% its first Wednesday, so it's not entirely outside of the norm Tuesday to Wednesday drop, but I would say it's another huge drop in my opinion.  It should cross $200 domestic tomorrow as it positions itself for a $60 to $70 million second weekend gross.  Yes, we should expect a weekend drop.  of between 61% and 54% for a 10-day total, between $255 and $265.  Yes, it could certainly drop farther than the 62% weekend drop for Spider-Man Homecoming, the biggest MCU second weekend plunge thus far, which also, it's interesting because that film is widely... loved uh but that won't be cause for alarm.  first we're talking about a movie that costs 150 and opened at 450 million worldwide and that's a fair point right.  the film costs 150. let's say they underestimate that they under report that cost 200 million.  they spent another 200 million at uh on marketing maybe even 300 million.  um they're going to be breaking even this weekend.  Everything else is gravy from on top of that.  What we don't know is how many tickets it unsold for Avengers Endgame.  And what we also don't know is what their real expectations are.  We know movies like Tron made hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions and were still widely considered a flop because theaters don't invest $400 million to only make $100.  I would imagine they're looking to double or triple their investment every single time.  With an over-under, of 550 global it should cross 600 million and thus quadruple its budget.  now scott mendelsohn is conveniently forgetting out the gigantic marketing budget which often will you know equal or surpass the actual film budget.  but scott is not an accurate reporter.  Even with marketing factored in, the Brie Larson sci-fi actioneer will start making money by the end of this sentence.  Second, we will have at least two recent cases where big superhero movies took giant second weekend drops and still have lived on to fight another day.  And that's true.  I mean, you have like Spider-Man Homecoming, which was basically out forever.  Suicide Squad, $133 million Friday to Sunday debut August, but nosedived a 43-second weekend thanks to being the last big movie of the summer and getting five weeks before Sully, nearly two months before Sony's Magnificent Seven.  So basically, it stuck around and just kept drawing fans over and over and over again.  By the way, it was a better multiplier.  2.44 than Captain Marvel, 2.27 Age of Ultron, Iron Man.  And yes, these are all terrible films.  Again, I want to point to inflation taking price over time.  Right now, we're sitting with Captain Marvel still being the 19th out of 21 films earning domestically.  Now, There is not a lot of money, relatively speaking, between 19 and, say, 12 or 13 at this point, where they're at 250 and 300 million.  They have another big weekend, you drop another 100 million, now you're at 279, that puts you in 12th.  But when we adjust for inflation, we're still seeing Captain Marvel while already surpassing the Incredible Hulk, which is great.  It will pass Ant-Man and the first Avenger and Thor most likely, but still a long way from some of these older films.  Look at the original Iron Man sitting at 400 million when adjusted for inflation.  The increased ticket prices and the greater push to use IMAX absolutely is pushing these box office numbers up.  Do I think Disney bought tickets?  It's in the realm of possibility.  Will we see another big box office drop?  I think so.  When do we have pre-apologizing happening out of the mainstream media already?  I'm willing to bet that they already know it's going to drop and maybe all those seat fillers were busy this weekend.  I hope you enjoyed this video.  We'll talk to you again real soon. ",
