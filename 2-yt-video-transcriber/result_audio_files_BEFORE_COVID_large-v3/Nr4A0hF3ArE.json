            "text": "Nora Ephron walked off the show.  Yeah.  Right, and so did Sinead O'Connor, I think, right?  I was there for that one, too.  You were there for Sinead O'Connor?  Yeah.  It was Nora Dunn, by the way.  Oh, no, I meant when Dice did it, Sinead... Was that the same show?  No, that wasn't the same show.  No, she said she didn't want to do it because Dice was performing for her to get a different musical guest.  This guy, you hired this guy to ruin all the interviews?  No, so, how about this?  Adam had a question he wanted to ask you about your comedy.  Yeah, I've been chomping at the bits to ask this one.  I've been thinking about it all week.  Norm told me to come up with some questions for you, and I've just been dying to know, where do you get your ideas from?  Yeah, I've been dying to know, where do you get your ideas from?  I've been watching you for years and I've always been really curious.  Where do you get your ideas from?  I think it's been really a thorough interview.  I just wanted, I mean, I always wanted to know where he got his ideas from, but I think we've, you know.  I've never been asked that before.  Well, where do you get your ideas from?  I don't know where I get my, I don't know.  I don't know.  Jeez.  Do you have a specific idea you want to know?  No, just all of them.  All of them?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why didn't you answer his question?  What was his question?  Ask him that.  Don't ask that again.  That was the dumbest goddamn question I've ever heard.  You just want to know where you got it?  Yeah, well, I got to tell you where I got it.  At Ralph's.  That's where I got it.  Any particular Ralph's?  Yes.  No, it's at Beverly Hills Ralph's.  Okay.  Got it in the meat section.  The one on Beverly.  Beverly Drive.  Okay.  Listen, the next story we have is in health news, actually.  And no offense, Norm, but I think you should probably pay attention to this.  Let's take a listen.  A new study out of Harvard linking 1 in 10 deaths in this country to excessive salt.  A lot of things would have to go very, very right for me to die of salt.  The only thing I can pray for is that I die of salt and not, you know, begging for mercy.  So I think that's nonsense, that people should be afraid of too much salt.  Now, I know you eat a lot of salt, though, Norm.  We were discussing this earlier.  entertainment news.  This is something you guys both wanted to discuss.  Get to it.  Let's roll the clip.  Oh, not another one.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  There is no clip.  We have a... He said, let's roll the clip and it's a picture.  It's always just so... I tell you, even the prisoners are going back to bed.  Well, I'll explain what's going on.  Adam Eger told me something I didn't know.  He said you worked with Red Fox on a variety show.  Yeah, I heard that.  I'm dying to hear.  I produced Red Fox variety shows.  You told me he just worked on it.  Worked on it?  Well, that's, I mean, according to your Wikipedia.  What do you think I was, a stagehand, you douchebag?  Worked on it?  Did you do your notes?  I want you back on drugs.  I'm serious.  I want you back on stuff so you know.  I'm going to do a shot next.  No, no, no, no, it's true.  I'm just teasing you.  This is good, huh?  Here, pray.  I'm Adam.  Whatever.  Well, that name's a name.  Jesus Christ, he gets fucked up.  You knew what he meant.  Yeah.  Did you know that Adam Egan did comedy for a while?  You did?  Very briefly.  But you performed?  Very briefly.  Open mics?  In L.A.  or in Phoenix?  In Arizona.  In Arizona.  He was famous for thrusting out his cock.  Like he'd push, like he'd stand at the mic and he'd push forward.  so it was... He was a nervous... Yeah.  He was a hell of a hog.  Yeah.  People say that.  Yeah.  Do you have a big dick?  I... the people said you have a big day.  yeah i guess that's.  you know what you say.  no next time no brian regan plays salt lake city and he does it for a month straight.  he does.  that makes sense.  they love him.  he's one of the few.  that's just that good.  he's just so worked so clean.  yeah perfectly clean and he's hilarious.  that's tough to be that good and clean.  yeah that's so impressive.  I'm impressed with clean comics.  Me too.  Way more impressed than anyone.  that's superior as a dirty.  It seems like a crush a lot of times.  I like dirty ones too.  I like dirty ones.  It's a real meeting of the mind.  Remember when you had to do jokes about Yule Gibbons?  Oh, yeah.  Eating cardboard.  Yeah, eating cardboard.  And I didn't even know who he was when I was a kid, but I just laughed.  I still don't know.  Who's Ewell Gibbons?  I think he did a great Matt Cereals commercial.  I love.  now I have to explain to this fucking guy.  He was about roughage and organic roughage.  Got it.  So he went, he, I didn't even know Grape Nuts had a, you know, I didn't know they had a commercial.  Shut up.  For one fucking minute, you know, trying to talk to a legend of comedy, you're talking about.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, yeah.  How did you guys meet?  Did you have to audition for this?  We covered that in the Tom Green episode.  No, we met at Tempe Improv.  I like he's mad, he's mad at you.  We covered that in the Tom Green episode.  I was saying it to you.  I met him when I used to manage the improv in Tempe.  I didn't ask you if you managed the improv.  I just asked you where you met him.  I'm going to show you how I act by reacting.  How are you feeling, Carolyn?  In my head, I'm thinking, how am I feeling?  All right.  Jesus, that was good.  I'm not finished.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm all right.  You?  You?  Worst reaction ever.  Doesn't even know how he fucked.  But whatever, you know, you need a sidekick.  My favorite sketch of all time you were actually in was the Mr.  Belvedere fan club.  Oh yeah, that was good.  Fred Wolf wrote that.  That was a good one.  And the other one you were also in, I always loved Sabra Price was right.  And both Tom Hanks, which is actually... That was old.  Smigel wrote that one.  Yeah, those were my... You were talking about... Hey, that was my first skit ever.  Oh, the... Sabres.  Yeah, Mr.  Belvedere.  No, Sabres.  Sabres?  Bryce is right.  This is your greatest instrument.  This right here.  You ever think about revisiting some of your old roles?  You're sweating like a... He's sweating like a whore in church, Adam.  They cut the budget on the show.  We don't have air conditioning anymore.  That's a good question.  You think about revisiting it.  Everything's going to be okay, buddy.  He's very nervous.  The Invinible is good.  The Invinible is good.  That was a Letterman laugh.  The Invinible is good.  I don't have a laugh.  Do you have a good laugh?  Yeah, like a real annoying laugh.  Yeah.  If you don't have one, that sounds fake.  Yeah.  I try, but it comes out weird.  What about you?  Yeah, I have a real obnoxious laugh.  I forgot he was here.  Yeah.  I know.  The minute you said that, I was like, should we be talking to the crew?  Do we cut?  Now, that story is not in the book.  No.  Why isn't that story in the book?  That should be in the book.  Oh, thanks, Adam.  Welcome back.  Are you out looking for apartments?  Jesus.  This is Adam Egan, by the way.  I noticed he was at the end of the table smiling.  Should we bring him into the conversation?  What do you think?  Adam.  I just did, yeah.  The whole commercial break was you asking questions.  I know.  And then as soon as we come on camera, you do all the work.  It's like Ralph Crandon.  Is he to help out with just your commercial breaks?  Keep his mouth shut after that?  I really don't know why.  We haven't found a position for him yet.  I think that's so cool how you said that about how, let's see what Caitlyn can do in the last quarter of her life, because that's traditionally where you always excelled in the comebacks in the fourth quarter.  Yeah, it is.  It is pretty interesting.  Yeah.  He beat the guy by 18 seconds.  That was the trials, but in 76 he came in at the second day.  I'm talking about the trials.  What do you think is the most difficult sport that you haven't tried?  He said it was the most difficult.  If I haven't tried it, I wouldn't know if it was difficult.  Where do you get him?  I don't know.  Did you get him off the street?  He said it was the best question ever.  I hope it's not in his notes.  What sport that doesn't exist is the hardest.  That's it.  We'll be back with more inanity.  I don't know what it is.  What is it that makes a woman more flexible than a man?  How the fuck am I going to know?  He's a great sidekick, isn't he?  He's absolutely no help.  He came up with Pastor Brad.  Yeah, he came up with Pastor Brad and then you having to imagine a sport that doesn't exist.  Carl Reiner said to me, The only problem I have is short-term memory loss.  The only problem I have is short-term memory loss.  Sometimes I'm beginning to worry about my short-term memory loss.  Sometimes I'm beginning to worry about my short-term memory loss.  Sometimes I'm beginning to worry about my short-term memory loss.  That was it.  I thought he was talking about his first Twitter.  I was like, that's a really long Twitter name.  Real Ed McMahon over here, huh?  Ed McBoy.  Thanks so much for calling in, Super Dave.  Please come back.  I didn't call in, asshole.  I didn't call in.  You called me.  I'm not calling into this.  Let me explain something.  If I'm homeless, I'm not calling in.  Duly noted, Super Dave.  You understand?  You understand?  Yes.  There's something beautiful about this one.  I'm not being ironic.  No, I really loved it, too.  It was great.  Oh, that's great.  Too bad this guy was here.  Yeah. ",
