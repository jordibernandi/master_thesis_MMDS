            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we turn to talking about the latest figurehead for the climate change awareness movement, Greta Thunberg.  This 16 year old from Sweden has become the talk of the town in the media this past few weeks, and I think we can all guess why.  Sure, she has a seemingly good message at its core.  Greta claims to be saving the world, and she's doing this mostly by raising awareness for so-called climate change.  And as I've said numerous times recently, you can really say what you want about the actual climate changing, and you can believe in it or not, and you can have your own thoughts on how bad it's happening, and whether or not we can or should be doing radical things to fix it.  These parts of the issue are pretty much secondary now.  as it's become pretty clear that this climate change phenomenon has mutated into something else, far more sinister.  First of all, it starts coming from the left-wingers and their need to virtue signal, and be dubbed as supposed superheroes for trying to save the world.  This is probably part of what enticed Greta herself to join this cause too, as she's certainly not the first teenager to have desires of supposedly saving the world through their actions, lifestyle, and even by protesting or demonstrating publicly.  The problem for teens like this in current year, though, is that, well, the problem is there are no real problems.  Gone are the days when teens could easily join an anti-violence movement and protest major wars like Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan.  There's also less social inequality.  Injustice in the world today and there's more and almost complete equality in the Western world, too.  so protesting say for the rights of women minorities or LGBT alphabet people is hardly as necessary as it used to be.  so this lack of a major cause is what's led to people like Greta Thunberg and other left-wingers to buy into this climate change hysteria completely and fully Almost as if they want it to be true more than it actually is.  This is why people say it's a religion for the left Because the climate change boogeyman is the perfect villain for them to fight against.  It's almost like the left's devil or the left wing version of Thanos or something.  And this is the perfect thing for them to raise awareness about for people like this too.  Who have these sorts of hero complexes and this dying need to virtue signal to the public.  But plenty of adults and politicians and even scientists have spoken out for climate change and the need to make radical changes to our lifestyles in order to help prevent it.  So what is it that makes Greta Thunberg so different?  Well, it's pretty obvious that the left is using this cute, harmless-looking 16-year-old Swede as a tool to do their bidding.  I mean, criticizing the adults like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Al Gore, that's pretty easy.  But when it's a young, uncomfortable girl speaking rather awkwardly because of her self-admitted Asperger's disorder, well, that makes Greta pretty hard to criticize.  And that's what makes her so valuable and useful to the Democrats who are backing her up.  It's like they found a speaker who's virtually bulletproof.  So they're pushing her out there into the public, knowing that if people criticize her, they will inevitably look bad and possibly evil.  I still struggle to dance around talking about Greta as I write this video, but in my opinion, if the left-wingers in the mainstream media and Greta herself are going to put her and her messages out there this much... I think that also opens them up to be discussed more vividly, despite her young age and her mental issues, which are clearly being used as a way to deflect criticism.  The thing is, though, I don't really have much against Greta Thunberg herself, actually.  Sure, her ideas are bad and this whole climate change.  saving the world stuff is a bit cringy and over the top, but you can hardly blame Greta herself for this, since she's clearly been brainwashed into doing all this.  That and having a condition like Asperger's will also affect your viewpoints and how you deal with world events in different ways.  People with spectrum disorders also have limited social skills, so sure they can easily figure out a complex problem and how it can be solved pretty quickly, but such a person is dependent on the image of the world presented to them by their family as well.  In this case with Greta Thunberg, her family painted a picture of a world that's going into ruins.  In this apocalyptic future she was presented at a very young age, will only lead to further deterioration of her mental state, which is very sad.  I pity her.  And with that said, I actually feel sorry for Greta more than anything.  Clearly, her parents and the Democrats and the mainstream media, they're the ones putting her up to this kind of stuff.  For example, besides the continuous and nonstop coverage in the press and media, which can be seen on almost every major news channel, well, Also, Greta's parents have been revealed to be SJW activists themselves, and also climate change pushers and even Antifa supporters as well.  That's right, as you can see from this picture going around on Twitter right now, both of Greta's parents and herself, they've all been seen in Antifa supporting t-shirts in recent times.  And while Greta tried to deflect this criticism saying she just borrowed a friend's t-shirt, well... I think that's a bit hard to believe since her parents can be seen wearing the same t-shirt themselves.  And this Antifa supporting is a bad look for two big reasons.  First of all, we've all seen and come to know that Antifa is a very bad group based in America who's not really anti-fascist at all.  They're actually a bit of a domestic terrorist group.  who shows up at right-wing conservative-leaning events and tries to beat people up and destroy property.  And also, even, they try and attack the police while they do it, like what happened recently at the Straight Pride Parade in Boston just last month.  And then, to make matters even worse, if you're familiar with Sweden's history in World War II like I am, seeing these three prominent Swedes wear anti-fascist garb in 2019 is pretty hypocritical when you think about it.  Sweden of course not only remained neutral during World War II, which in itself is a bit of a cop-out and weak, could have used their help to stop the actual fascists back then, especially when they were right near the war's battlegrounds themselves, but that's only the beginning here.  Sweden also didn't really remain completely 100% neutral.  They also assisted the Germans in a number of questionable ways.  During the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Sweden allowed the Germans to use Swedish railways to transport their things.  Also, German soldiers traveling on leave between Norway and Germany were also allowed passage through Sweden as well.  In addition, iron ore was also sold to Germany all throughout the war.  And, sure, Sweden also offered some help and intelligence to the Allies on our side, but they really should have offered all the help to us in the United States.  And they shouldn't have helped the fascist in Germany at all, but they apparently did.  And this harsh truth makes modern Swedes like Greta Thunberg and her family look rather silly wearing these anti-fascist shirts in the present.  They claim to be anti-fascist now, but they certainly weren't back then in World War II when it counted.  And then when you realize that the people they're calling fascist now, well, were actually American descendants of the real anti-fascists who helped stop the Germans in World War II with our blood, sweat, and tears.  And well, if you put all that together, I think you guys get the point.  Next, let's get back to the climate change discussion here and where this all started and where it's gone recently.  Greta Thunberg actually began her climate change activism a few years back when she was just about 15.  Since then, she has repeatedly protested by not going to school on Fridays.  And now, the same thing just happened in America this past week.  Students who wanted to support Greta and her climate change cause were encouraged to skip school and to take to the streets to show their enthusiasm for it.  And this to me seems very questionable for two reasons.  First of all, they're basically bribing kids into supporting Greta Thunberg and climate change.  by offering them an unpunished day off of school if they join these protests.  And this is a pretty good strategy, actually, but it's not going to show us people who have genuine interest in their cause, at least not fully.  Obviously, many of these kids are just going to do this to get out of school.  If I was still in high school and I heard you could get off on Friday if you just say you're going to a climate change protest, and also the school supported that and wouldn't punish you for skipping that day, well... I know me and many of my friends would have done that in a heartbeat, regardless of our beliefs on the issue.  Speaking of which, that brings me to the next issue here.  Why are people even listening to teenagers on these kinds of serious issues anyway?  Greta herself is included in this.  Think about it.  These kids are 18 years old or less.  Greta is 16 and many of them are younger too.  So they literally know nothing about the world yet.  They've got no educations, no credentials, or even enough wisdom to fill a shot glass.  So, the idea that we should be listening to Greta and other teens about an issue that supposedly could end the world is absolutely preposterous.  We should really be listening to adults at the very least.  And really, more specifically, we should be listening to scientists, doctors, professors, and other certified smart people who seem to be totally absent when any of this climate change bullshit is going on.  And believe me, the absence of scientists and the abundance of teens trying to skip school here, it really shows a lot about this whole climate change cause.  Next, Greta is entertained by the United States Congress for some reason.  Didn't know random 16-year-olds from Sweden had a platform there, but I guess if you're a useful, ignorant, nearly bulletproof spokesperson for a cause that liberals support, like Greta, well that means you get to have your say in Congress now.  Let's go ahead and check out this cringy clip and see it for ourselves. ",

            "text": "So it's not your science and you can't explain it either.  And she pretends she doesn't want us to listen to her, but clearly she does.  Because of course, her side claims that if we don't listen to Greta, the world is going to end.  But if this study is from a year ago, like she just said, why does Greta even need to present this to Congress like this in the first place?  It's been out for a long time now.  Everyone who needed to see it already has.  And if it weren't for Greta Thunberg and the media propping her up, this study would fade into obscurity, as it probably should.  Despite recent emissions reductions, the United States is currently the second highest emitting country in the world annually.  And although we rank number two now, the United States is responsible for the most carbon pollution accumulated in the atmosphere.  So we're number two now.  Then who is number one?  Well, that would be China, of course.  But I don't see any plans for Greta to take a boat over to Beijing and preach to them about climate change in front of the communist government over there.  And this all doesn't really make sense when you think about it.  Climate change activists like Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and in the past Al Gore, they always seem to come after America directly and no one else.  Other countries aren't even mentioned.  And some of these other countries are more numerous and worse polluters than us too.  If they really cared about saving the world, would it make more sense to start with China, the world's worst polluter?  Instead, China gets a free pass for some reason, and these liberals just come after the United States of America.  And that's because their goals aren't actually as transparent as they claim or present.  Really, this whole climate change push isn't about saving the planet at all.  It's actually about Democrats and liberals getting more government control.  That's why climate change fixes and propositions and laws, they always end up benefiting the left-wingers and their causes.  And they also make way for their plans of bigger government that eventually go completely socialist under them too.  AOC's Green New Deal is probably the best example of this.  or the worst, depending on how you see it.  And the Green New Deal is a plan that all these climate change zealots support, too.  And as we've said before time and time again, not only is the Green New Deal radical, over-the-top, and impractical, it's also a bit of a Trojan horse with loads of other social justice-related, liberal, and socialist policies hidden within it that have nothing to do with saving the environment at all.  Climate change and Greta Thunberg... are obviously being pushed as a way for Democrats to get more control here.  And what better way to get that control than to scare people into voting for you by telling them the world is going to end if you don't?  And also, having a cute, harmless-looking teenager with a disability pushing this, who we all know if we attack or disagree with, we'll all get rightfully shit on for, well, that's a nice touch too.  And this is a great way to show the left is just doing a lot of propaganda pushing.  How can we get more young people involved? ",

            "text": "The truth is, though, we shouldn't be getting young children involved in this kind of stuff at all.  Only a radical liberal with a shitty mindset would think indoctrinating children into their political beliefs by telling them the world is going to end is a good idea.  And that sounds exactly like what churches do, talking about the apocalypse and stuff.  This is cult-like behavior.  And obviously we shouldn't be scaring our kids into becoming liberals or anything else.  Let the kids grow up and keep a little bit of their youth and innocence for Christ's sake.  Because using them in situations like this is just plain wrong and also pathetic.  Democrats continue to use children in this way though.  And this climate change issue isn't the first time nor will it be the last time either.  In the end, I want to stress this again.  Even former President Barack Hussein Obama got in on this Greta meme himself too, meeting with her again recently and That's something he also did a few years back when he was president as well.  And as I've mentioned before, nothing really proves that Obama or Al Gore or AOC or other prominent Democrats, well, nothing proves they don't actually believe in this climate change hysteria more than the life choices they make that completely oppose it.  Both Obama and Gore have bought houses on oceanfront properties, properties that won't be there in a few years if climate change and the water rising was really an issue.  But the truth is, even the Democrats don't believe the bullshit they're spouting.  Why else would someone like AOC buy her mom a house in Florida while also claiming that Miami will be underwater in a few years?  Well, they're doing this because they don't actually believe in the climate change hysteria that they're peddling.  And that means they're only supporting it in activists like Greta so they can use climate change to get them their other, more nefarious things done, like getting votes from ignorant people, more power in government, and more control over our everyday lives.  What do you guys think?  Should we be listening to brainwashed 16 year olds from Sweden about climate change?  Why is the left and the mainstream media really propping up this troubled activist?  And why would Obama buy a million dollar mansion by the water on an island if he really thought climate change would raise the sea levels?
