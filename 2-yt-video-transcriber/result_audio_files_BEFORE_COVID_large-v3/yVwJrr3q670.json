            "text": "Jesus Christ has chosen this quick update.  Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I just want to do this quick little video concerning Kobe.  Kobe Byron, who died, as you know, in a plane crash not long ago.  Sometime last week, I think, because we're on the 30th.  I forgot the date when he passed away.  So I just wanted to... I just wanted to do a little video concerning that really.  We're not asleep.  We're not asleep.  We know what Hollywood is like.  I think, I don't think, sorry, I know that knowledge has been released in the land.  What I mean by that part of the knowledge is that the Lord allows his people to be aware of the satanic activities that's happening in the world.  Many years ago, many, many years ago, the Illuminati, the satanic kingdom could get away with stuff.  And I think that's the reason why they have the thing called the Illuminati cards, the Illuminati card game or something like that, that they did in the 80s or the 90s.  Because I don't think that these people knew that the body of Christ would catch up on what they're doing.  And... Sorry.  I commend, though I don't watch them at all, but I commend all these channels on YouTube, all these channels on YouTube who dedicate their time to educate the people concerning the illuminatis and the satanic activities and the sacrifices and the this and that that is going on.  because of this knowledge brothers and sisters because of this knowledge we understand how blood sacrifices work.  we understand all the how how they sacrifice children you know we understand uh just the wicked and the share evil that happened in this in these secret societies.  is it is not good it is not good brothers and sisters but you've got channels out there that talks about these things and they're coming from a place of truth.  now Obviously with Kobe, Kobe Bryant, it was very sad, you know, very, very sad that he died.  And I think his daughter died as well, along with other people.  I think it was nine people or something like that, that died in this plane crash.  And there's speculations, was he a sacrifice?  What happened?  and all of that.  now as i said there are videos out there.  i have not it's i have not watched any but i know that there's.  there's channels out there that you know.  dedicate the time to to talk about the illuminating sacrifice and all that.  but what i can say brothers and sisters concerning uh kobe's death it is not a mistake.  It is not coincidental.  I believe it was planned.  I truly believe it was planned.  I believe that his death was a sacrifice.  Someone sacrificed him because they want to get higher.  Because that's how they work, right?  That is how they work.  It's called blood sacrifice because Satan, that devil is wicked.  Oh, I can't wait for him to be thrown into hell, brothers and sisters.  Honestly, I cannot wait for Satan to be thrown.  He's so wicked.  He's so wicked.  So someone... You know, he's a blood sacrifice.  He really is.  You know, he really is a blood sacrifice.  He's the main one.  I know that his daughter died and all of that.  And all the people with him.  But... I am not in the secular media.  I do not watch TV.  I do not watch the news or anything like that.  So the next big thing... I don't know who he's going to be, you know.  But just watch out for somebody else.  I'm not saying that this person that comes on the scene who blows up and becomes rich and famous is off the back of Kobe.  I'm not saying that.  But when these things happen, brothers and sisters, there's always somebody that comes up.  and blows up hugely.  But I truly believe that his death was sacrifice.  It was a blood sacrifice.  It really was.  That's what the Holy Spirit is telling me.  And this is me not reading anything.  I have not, you know, I have not read the news or anything.  So you might say, oh, do you know it's nine people?  I only know it's nine people because my husband bought up a picture.  Kobe and the plane crash and the nine people who died that's all of you.  that is it that is it?  nothing else?  nothing else didn't read underneath nothing at all.  and so we know I'm telling you it's a blood sacrifice.  sad isn't it?  it is sad.  people are not going to sacrifice people like that unless they're in the secret society.  And when you sign up to these things, when you sign up for richness and to become famous and to do this and to do that, please know that there's going to come a time when Satan is going to want his reward.  And that can include your families, brothers and sisters.  This is how serious this thing is.  It's demonic.  It's satanic.  And as I said, yes, it is sad that, you know, Kobe died in the plane crash with his daughter and the rest of the people that perished with him.  It's very sad, but he's a blood sacrifice.  And I have to say it as it is.  Why is he a blood sacrifice?  You will know in time.  You will know the reason.  It will come out in the media.  It will come out.  in on youtube or something like that if it's not already there.  but kobe is a blood sacrifice.  that's very sad.  stay away from the illuminati.  don't get mixed up in the satanic rituals.  don't do it.  brothers and sisters run far away even if you're suffering even if you don't have a cup of water a cup of tea.  just don't join them.  Don't join anything that is satanic.  Do not join the occult.  Do not join the occult, brothers and sisters, for fame or anything like that.  Don't do it, brothers and sisters.  I am telling you, it is not worth it.  Your soul belongs to the Most High God.  Your soul belongs to Him.  And you may not have riches right now on this earth.  In this fallen planet.  But I can assure you.  I can assure you brothers and sisters.  That if you stay circumspect.  If you continue to walk in the integrity of the most high.  Oh glory to God.  Your riches in heaven.  lost for words lost for words brothers and sisters because it will be so beautiful babasah do not store up your riches on earth where moth and you know rodent and all that.  Gather on them.  Okay.  But store up your riches.  that is in heaven.  Which means what the Bible is saying is that.  You should seek.  Spiritual stuff.  You should seek spiritual things.  Brothers and sisters.  Seek spiritual.  Your treasures is in heaven.  Your treasure is there.  So don't.  Do not get hungry to become rich in this world because you will fail.  Because at the end of the day, at the end of the day, it's all going to pass away.  You cannot take it with you to heaven.  You cannot take a car or anything like that.  Your money, you cannot take it.  But the only thing that you can take is your soul, is your heart.  That's what's going to get you into the promised land.  Into glory.  That's what's going to take you there, brothers and sisters.  Don't look at these celebrities.  Don't look at these celebrities and say you want to become like them.  Because you do not know what they have to do to get where they are.  Because they have to do a lot of things.  They just don't get rich like that.  If Satan... If Lucifer, right?  offered the messiah the king of glory the lamb of god hallelujah if if lucifer had the cheek because that's what it is.  he had the cheek to go to the son of god and said oh yeah look see all the world i'll give you the world i'll give you the world.  just bow down in front of me.  so if say our turn these stones into bread if satan has had the audacity And the cheek, the bare face, the fastiness.  So tempt the son of God.  Don't you think he's going to tempt us mere men?  Of course he will.  And that's what he's done.  And some of us just go for the bait.  We just go for it.  But when you do that, just remember it's coming back after you.  It's coming after you and it's coming after your families.  So you have to be very careful.  Run away.  It's better to suffer in life.  It's better to suffer in life than sell your soul to the wicked, fallen angel, Lucifer.  I think my thing is going to run out now.  Ah, yes.  So God eternally bless you.  I love you all.  And I'll see you soon.  Someday in glory.  In Jesus' precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen. ",
