            "text": "Now, I don't take a lot of joy in anyone losing their jobs.  And in the video game world, it happens all too often.  But today, I want to celebrate probably the biggest moment in Get Woke Go Broke history.  I have amazing news to provide.  Get your mouse hovering over that thumbs up button and the cursor over the comment section to celebrate the news that Feminist Frequency, run by Anita Sarkeesian, is broke.  No, no, no, no.  All jokes aside, I think it's a great time.  I knew something was up when Polygon and all the other video game outlets were putting out these weird articles.  I knew something was up when there were tweets about CD Projekt Red trying to get money out of them to advise on Cyberpunk 2077.  I knew it.  I knew it.  And not only do we have... Basically irrefutable evidence in terms of their financial records, because as an agency or as a company that wanted to register as a nonprofit, they then had to publish their earnings records.  So reluctantly, they probably had to share the information with us.  But also there's a lot of happenstance and other information that helps build the case that it is pretty clear that this organization is broke.  Now, I want to start off with kind of the tweet that started it all, that grabbed my attention in the first place.  There was a little tweet, a little tweetsky-poo, a little while ago, early June.  We saw Ms.  Sarkeesian say, sorry, what?  EA, Electronic Arts, is donating a million dollars to nonprofits working to end bad behavior online?  Some facts.  They didn't speak up during GG at all.  And Feminist Frequency has been a nonprofit on the front lines of this issue, constantly struggling with funding.  You know what's interesting to me is as an organization, with just a quarter million subscribers on YouTube, a barren podcast.  I wonder what kind of overhead this agency has.  I wonder how the hundreds of thousands of dollars companies like Intel have donated them.  Where did that go exactly?  And then you start to build the picture a little bit.  Earlier this week, there was an article put out by Polygon, an article that I didn't necessarily want to cover because I get it.  You are all absolutely right when you say, hey, stop covering this person.  Let them fade away.  But I think it's good to celebrate the end of an era here.  And I think that's exactly what this Polygon article was.  It was like an in memoram in the third paragraph or chapter three.  There's some interesting information that led to some more digging.  Earlier this year, Sarkeesian decided that femme frequency needed to change.  She ceased taking a salary, who knows how big it was, by the way, and laid off her co-creators and close friends, Ebony Adams and Petit.  She closed her offices and stopped making videos.  She said she has no pat answer to the questions as to why she's decided to move on.  No, it was just time, she said.  Interesting that you would say it was just time right around the time that several of your friends and coworkers have come out publicly to say you weren't paying them.  Earlier in May this year, we said Petit, that's her last name, Carolyn, came out to say, Hi, everyone.  Thanks for visiting my Ko-Fi page.  And Clay, in case you're wondering why I set this up, I'd like to take this moment here to explain.  Now, Ko-Fi must be some sort of Patreon type thing.  or PayPal type funding.  These days, it seems that many of us need to ask for a bit of help.  Well, okay, that's fine.  At one point or another, it's now my turn.  Since January of this year, I've been working in a volunteer capacity, not taking pay.  with feminist frequency and no longer receiving a salary.  During this time, I've been looking for work.  Good.  Okay, good.  You know what, Carolyn, go make some money.  I hope you land on your feet.  But then we look at more information.  Now, Colin Campbell, as MomBot points out, is the author of the Polygon piece that started the dominoes.  He also wrote a review of Zoe Quinn's book.  He is known for writing articles like this when his friends, when they have their popularity wane.  Of course, the article here in archive form, which is the best possible way.  I took a look.  at the Femme Frequency Patreon, and it still has about $2,500 a month in backing.  No small amount, but I imagine not enough to pay rent out in California and things like that, although I don't know.  Maybe she has five roommates.  But then we look at another one, and look at all these people, as a side note, who seem to... live off that grift for the last four years.  They're all broke.  How about another one?  By the way, just a fun little side note, little tidbit.  Another one is Zoe Quinn's con network.  Volunteer snapped and made a long series of tweets in which she denounced Zoe for failing to pay her staff.  They also call her Kickstarter a scam, which is obviously, we know many, many thousands of dollars were raised for this game.  I believe... jim sterling voiced us a character in the game the game will never come out.  and uh zoe quinn is also broke.  maybe we'll make a zoe quinn is broke.  uh video next.  uh but then you saw this tweet.  okay this tweet comes out from snarkisian here which started it all as you can see 3 800 comments to 1 500 likes.  i'd like to submit this to Webster's Dictionary so they can put it as Webster's Dictionary defines being ratioed as.  And you had this tweet come out, which I covered.  Hey, CD Projekt Red, I'm always available for consulting because it sounds like you need it before the whole of the internet drags you for what sounds like some potentially problematic representations, which we all know you've struggled with in the past.  teeth emoji guy of course going on to then link her consulting form.  it would seem that sarkeesian has realized recognized that her audience is gone.  if we look at feminist frequency in terms of the youtube channel which as far as i know was the only real place they put out content other than their website you can see They've actually seen a 20% improvement in views over the last 30 days, which is solid.  But you can see their channel is growing in reverse, averaging a loss of 10 subscribers a day and losing about 300 in the last 30 days.  That's like Pat the NES punk numbers, nothing to really write home about.  But the interesting thing, you're averaging just 2,800 views a day.  For a channel with a quarter million subscribers, that tells us a lot.  That tells us that all those subscribers are long gone.  Look, when I look at my channel, a lot of people say, oh, shout out to you for having 500,000 subscribers or whatever the number is.  And I will tell you this.  Yes, it's cool, all right?  But it doesn't matter if people aren't watching your videos.  I would say at least half of my subscribers that are a part of that number are probably dormant.  They've moved on.  They just haven't unsubbed.  They haven't been on YouTube in a long time.  So it's always this race.  That's why you always have to be putting out content.  That's why people ask me, like, dude, putting out three videos a day, why do you do that?  That's crazy.  Well... Honestly, I've got to stay on top of things.  And I also know that the window of relevancy on YouTube is really small.  If you're lucky, you'll get a year.  If I'm really lucky, the quartering will still continue to be getting decent views this Christmas season.  Very, very, very, very, very, very, very few content creators stick around longer than that in the grand scheme of things.  Now, in terms of their Patreon having about $2,500 a month, let's take a look at actual earnings.  Now, these are publicly filed information.  We'll just look at the last two years because I think it paints a really good picture.  We look at the cash flow report.  is obviously um uh super trimmed down but i'll go through what the important things are.  so opening balance that means uh at the end of 2017 or at the end of 2016 they had a certain number of dollars in the bank.  right at this time it was 343 721. pretty good.  i'd love to have that in the exclusively games bank account because then i could count on that website keep on going beyond many, many years.  But nonetheless, she had about $350,000.  She brought in $95,000 in 2016 and had individual donations that is like via Kickstarters or things like that of 140,000.  So this company doesn't actually generate any revenue.  It survives exclusively off donations.  So between individual donations, and she also got a government grant for $8,000.  And then you had miscellaneous revenue of $13,000.  I'm going to guess that this is actually YouTube or affiliate sales.  So all in total revenue was $254,000.  But let's look at where they spent their money.  They're spending $2 for every dollar that they make.  They had a programming cost of $195,000.  Now, on top of that, you had administrative costs of $116,000.  So between your programming and administrative, which probably are both salary-related, you're talking about nearly $300,000.  a lot of that was probably a big huge salary which is why for example a fellow non-profit website exclusivelygames.com i will never take a salary.  i pay my writers and i pay my editor but i will never take a salary because that's not really a good way to have longevity maybe one day but i'm not planning on it.  so we look at miscellaneous revenue.  so then Development and community engagement, $126,000.  Now, I don't know if that's travel expenses or whatever, but they're spending bottom line.  You don't have to be a CPA or an accountant or whatever to see that you're spending $438,000 and you only brought in $254,000.  They ended that year with $149,711 in the bank.  Now, at this exact moment, when you're filing your 2017 information, You should probably \u2013 I'm sorry.  This was actually opening balance for the year 2017.  It would have been filed in 2018.  I misspoke there.  So we look at the staff.  You have Anita, Carolyn, who's working for free, Ebony, who is laid off, Ashley, who's a giving officer.  And Rachel Albar.  So you have 400K in costs for five employees, three of which are working for free at this point.  Now we'll look at the financial data from 2018.  This is filed in early 2019 as far as I remember.  Cashflow, they opened with $157,490, which is weird because there was randomly $7,500 not included.  Maybe that was the grant, $7,800.  Is that the difference?  $149,700 plus $7,800.  No, that doesn't necessarily add up, does it?  Whatever.  They say you open with $157,000.  You made 100, I'm sorry, you brought in 197,000.  So you basically have the same, you dropped $50,000 in funding.  So you have 254,000 the previous year, this year, 197.  But then you have total operating funds in 2018. saying miscellaneous revenue includes financial or fiscal sponsor administrative revenue and contributions made through the websites offering charitable donation options, such as Amazon Smile and Twitter.  which operating funds also include an opening balance as of 1-1-2018 and incoming revenue for the year.  So we see, okay, you brought in $197,000.  Again, you spent $323,000.  So you are spending, again, almost, in this case, $2.  Last year it was $2 to 1.  Now it's just under $2 to 1.  And you had only $30,000 in the bank.  You're broke.  That's why you had to stop taking a salary.  That wasn't by choice.  You didn't have any money left.  It was over, which now you know exactly why.  she was mad that Intel didn't give her any money.  You know exactly why she was trying to get money from CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077 game.  there's no money left.  it's over.  the well is dried up.  celebrate it.  it's the end of an era now usually at the end of one's um life cycle they become very unpredictable as we see with modern day journalists right.  so we're going to want to watch because i would be willing to bet there's going to be some uh some narratives getting pushed here which is exactly why we saw the article from polygon.  so as i always will tell you do not contact this person let's just silently stay over here And watch it from afar.  And thank goodness that people finally wised up or moved on and started putting their money elsewhere.  I hope you enjoyed this video as much as I enjoyed making it.  We'll talk to you again real soon. ",
