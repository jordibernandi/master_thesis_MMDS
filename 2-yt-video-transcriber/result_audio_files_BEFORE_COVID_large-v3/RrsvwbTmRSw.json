            "text": "Shalom, shalom, shalom to the 12 tribes of Yisrael that have been scattered worldwide to the four corners of the earth.  Hallelujah.  We give all praise and all honor and all glory for this marvelous season of Pesach.  uh looked outside saw the beautiful uh moon that is full almost 100 and it lets us know that.  uh we are in the 14th or entering into the 14th of abib and which is the time that set apart in scripture for passover a time that we remember the blood that was shed on our behalf For without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin.  And Abba Yah, by his mercy and his grace, allow his only begotten son, Yahushua HaMashiach, who is the visible image of the invisible Yah, to shed his blood on our behalf so that we can be reconciled to Abba Yah.  um told our rabbi that in these last days told our rabbi y'all that you are giving us this information and um we're so through with that easter and eggs and bunnies and pigs and foolishness that we was caught up in.  oh my goodness all that have been passed away and now all things are becoming new.  I want the worldwide assembly to know that people have been coming out here, flying in to Fresno for this event.  It's a beautiful thing.  Everyone is in good spirits, the musicians.  We just started, there are musicians coming in from everywhere and we started trying to rehearse it.  We started feeling the move of yah even in the little time that we was just rehearsing just trying to touch on some of the songs we're going to do tomorrow night.  it's a beautiful thing.  um make sure that as we come we get the leaven out first not just 11 out of your homes.  But we get all that leaven out of our heart, which means Zion, that we do introspection, that we pray, that we try to remove anything that's in us that is not like the Most High Yah, that is not in accordance with Torah.  We want that to be done away with.  so that we can become a pure vessel and a pure channel for Yah to move through as we remember that ultimate sacrifice that Yahushua, our King, made on our behalf.  As a matter of fact, the lamb in Goshen, even though it was an actual lamb, the blood on the doorpost was symbolic.  his blood that would be shed on our behalf.  And so it's a marvelous thing.  I wanted to put this video up because as we move into this time, of course, you got to remember there will be an increase of satanic activity, increase of satanic attack.  Just like when we come around Christmas, you get bombarded.  with all kinds of stuff having to do with elves and heat misers and snow misers and and flying reindeer and and magic dust and oh my goodness phallus phallic trees which is really um the penis of tam moves and and bringing that got people bowing down to all that stuff happens during that time.  well guess what the same exact thing and probably even more Happens around Easter because the name Easter comes from Estarte and y'all know that by now.  And Estarte is a pagan deity, a fertility goddess.  And that's where those eggs come from and those bunnies and all that.  Those are sex rituals.  And those sexual rituals that are unbiblical and unrighteous and unholy, Yah said he's going to judge.  He said this time of year, he's going to not only judge the people, but when you read the Exodus account, I think in chapter 11 or 12, he literally says, I'm going to judge the gods, G-O-D-S, I'm going to judge them and their gods.  I'm gonna judge them and their gods.  I'm not only judging the people, I'm not only gonna kill and slay because their actions are worthy of death, but I'm also going to slay their gods.  Their gods, that people literally have gods.  And I watched something this year, and it's very interesting, it happened this year, that Notre Dame, right before the celebration their biggest celebration of astarte which even in even the name of it means something like our lady um the even that yah allowed that place or yah himself uh allowed that place catch on fire that right there was like whoa.  He says, I'm not only against you, but I'm against all your idols.  And when you start looking at, I've been to Notre Dame.  I've been there.  I've seen it.  I've toured it.  And one thing that that place is full of, idols.  Oh, man.  Little ugly gargoyles and all kind of weird sculptures and things all over that place.  And from the inside, there is idols all the way through inside and out.  And as we wake up to the truth, we know that, you know, Easter's pagan is the worship of Shemramis.  And we know that her name, Esther, Esther, and all, Oster, and all those different names we know through time.  that she's come under many, that whore demon has been called by many things.  And unfortunately, you know, we got our people getting ready to go through those satanic sexual rites.  And when I say a rite, that word is short for rituals.  They're going to go through these satanic pagan sex rituals.  And I thought it was interesting that in 2019, several things happened and I'm going to shut this video down, but I want you to see something.  One, it is widely believed that this is the 400th year mark.  Since our people were put into captivity here in this particular nation, and we're still here.  And in the 400th year mark, we're waking up to the truth.  In the 400th year mark, not only are we waking up to the truth, but we have left the Christian church and all the paganism that's there.  And we started keeping Passover, and we're going to keep a fantastic Passover this year.  And on top of that, Passover is the same weekend as the celebration of Estarde, the pagan.  And it's as though Yah is making people in this hour choose upsides.  I think that's a beautiful thing.  So while we're going to be keeping Passover, they're going to be having what's called Good Friday.  And it ain't no such thing as no Good Friday service.  But they're going to do it, a heating down Friday.  while we will be keeping the high and holy Shabbat, which is a high day, they're going, that's going to be what, Saturday?  So I don't think they're doing anything.  But I do know this, Sunday, they're going to be celebrating Easter.  So you're going to be seeing a lot Zion.  You're going to see the pagan rites and rituals.  That bunny itself was actually, that's where the playboy bunny and all that, man, that's all connected to that pagan sex ritual.  And the Most High at this time has brought us out.  And this year, he is allowing those two things to run simultaneous.  And at the same time, he caused the fall of their God and their gods by burning up that church.  And he did that on purpose.  And I just want to say this is not the first time it happened.  Don't forget about Dagon.  And when the Ark of the Covenant was brought into the temple, how Dagon, into the pagan temple of the Philistines, how Dagon was found falling on his face, destroyed.  Why?  Because Yah was getting ready to do something.  And may I say this?  Y'all is getting ready to do something again.  And therefore, one of the greatest icons of Estardi has been destroyed just days before the celebration.  It's as though y'all are saying, hey, I'm going to give y'all a chance.  But for us who's come to the knowledge of the truth and getting ready to keep Passover, just be encouraged.  Hallelujah.  We're on the right side.  It ain't going to be long.  Our king is coming and we're going home.  This is just a rehearsal for the real thing.  So just want to give y'all some encouragement.  Shalom. ",
