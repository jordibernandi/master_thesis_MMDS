As you may know, the Congresswoman introduced House Resolution 109, recognizing the duty of the federal government to create a Green New Deal.  The Green New Deal would offer a federal jobs guarantee free higher education, free high-quality health care, and a transition to 100% clean energy from zero-emission energy sources.  On Meet the Press Daily, AOC talked about the role of young people in the Green New Deal movement. ",

            "text": "But seriously, under the Green New Deal, all vehicles in the United States would need to be replaced with all electric vehicles within 10 years.  Now, I'm not against electric vehicles.  I think they're pretty cool.  But let's see how it would affect the Congresswoman's constituents here in New York City.  Currently, there are over 2.1 million vehicles registered in New York City with the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the cost to replace them all would be staggering to consumers and businesses.  For example, if you took the 1.9 million registered passenger vehicles and replaced them all with, say, the Nissan Leaf, which has an MSRP of $29,990, consumers would have to spend $57.6 billion.  But it's okay, because the government is going to give you tax credits.  Thanks to the New York State Drive Clean rebate, when you buy an electric vehicle, you get a tax credit of $2,000.  This in turn will cost the state $3.8 billion.  not to mention the federal electric vehicle tax credit which will cost the us government 14.4 billion dollars and that's just for the cars in new york city.  but once you have an electric vehicle you'll face a small issue charging it.  while vehicles that run on gasoline can be fueled up within a few minutes electric vehicles can take hours.
