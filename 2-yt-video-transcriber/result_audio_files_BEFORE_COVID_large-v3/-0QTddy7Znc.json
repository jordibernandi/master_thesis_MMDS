            "text": "I see that Tony Blair has released a New Year message, so I thought that I would release one too.  It's particularly galling for many of us when he takes to the airwaves and gets massive coverage for it, because we think he should be speaking from The Hague at the International Criminal Court.  It was particularly unfortunate for Mr Blair that he released his video on the day the American embassy in Baghdad was being destroyed by thousands of demonstrators causing the ambassador and other senior diplomats to be airlifted from the roof.  The blood is still running in the streets of Iraq since the crime committed.  by Tony Blair and George W. Bush, the best part of 20 years ago, but the reverberations, the consequences of their unhinged, insane attack, the worst foreign policy blunder since the First World War in 1914. took place.  But Tony Blair is emblematic of Britain's problems.  You see, Blairism is a cancer in British politics and it has not been cut out and it continues to grow.  Blair almost killed the Labour Party.  It showed some signs of coming back to life under Jeremy Corbyn, but it turns out that was an attempt to put someone else at the head of a party that remained fundamentally the same.  Blairite.  Tony Blair has a great deal to answer for, not just internationally but here in Britain.  His light-touch regulation, you could well say deregulation of the banks and the finance houses in the City of London, made a major contribution to the crash of of 2008 and the subsequent now 12 years of austerity that the British people have been suffering ever since.  So many people have died, many millions of people have suffered, shivered, suffered in the long winter of austerity caused by the crash of the financial institutions which Mr Blair and his sidekick Gordon Brown once trumpeted as one of their greatest achievements.  Tony Blair has a lot to answer for in British politics but he will always be remembered for his international crimes, beginning with Yugoslavia and his double harness with the cowboy Bill Clinton.  He will always be remembered for his theorising of the principle of intervention in other people's internal affairs, usually with blood and iron.  But he will never be forgotten by Iraq.  the erstwhile Trotskyite John MacDonald, the outgoing shadow chancellor in the Jeremy Corbyn administration, as was, he says that all is forgiven.  And when asked by Mr Blair's spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, if Tony Blair was a war criminal, he answered most definitively, absolutely not.  Well, Mr.  Macdonald, the majority of people in Britain consider Tony Blair a war criminal, all right, and the vast majority of people around the world think so too.  Some of us will never give up, as long as God gives us breath, the fight to bring him to justice.  And as I always say, after me, my sons.  I'd like to wish you all a happy new year, but I'm sorry to say that for many people in the world, there won't be much happiness around.  But we'll all continue to do our best to make a better Brexit Britain and a better world. ",
