            "text": "European Union are divided over Brexit, Viktor Orban turns on Emmanuel Macron and the European Parliament insults our Union flag.  Right, things are completely kicking off in Brussels.  This whole unity of the last four years has gone completely out the window.  And so today we're going to talk about this division over Brexit.  And towards the end of the video, we're going to talk about something very weird, what happened between Nigel Farage and the European Parliament with our union flag.  So keep watching to the end until we get there.  Now let's start because the European Union are not really happy about the Boris Johnson's government strategy when it comes to the Brexit trade talks.  So we'll talk about the reaction we've had, the division in this video.  But before we start, if you enjoy the content, make sure you click on the subscribe button and the bell next to it so you get notified.  We release videos every day at 5.45 p.m So let's begin.  So the Republic of Ireland.  are slightly upset over the UK's Brexit talk strategy and there are rumours coming from Brussels from the European Union officials and a British think tank has actually confirmed the legality of this.  so it could come a time when until December 2020 when the deadline comes for the Brexit trade talks that the European Union and Ireland could take the UK to the court over the Irish border.  They could take us to the court and they are considering this option which is kind of ridiculous.  This is how afraid they are and this is why I completely support this Trumpian style of negotiations from the Boris Johnson's government.  So the Institute for Government, the think tank, has released a new report that shows that Boris Johnson's Irish border plans obviously will be delivered by December 2020.  And then they claim that obviously if the UK does not put the measures into place by the end of that transition period, it could face being taken to the European Court of Justice by the European Commission of all places.  Surprise, surprise.  And because the report says that the government is unlikely to be able to implement this Northern Ireland protocol by the end of this year.  This is why the Irish deputy is now completely kicking off saying that there's absolutely not enough time for us to agree to something and this is why they're so afraid of actually having the UK leaving on WTO terms.  Now let's hear from the Irish deputy. ",

            "text": "This is something that Boris Johnson is saying he wants to do in less than 12 months.  And I think the European Union has constantly warned that that timeframe is ambitious, if not unrealistic.  And so from an EU perspective, we will try to approach all of these really important and sensitive areas with a sense of partnership and friendship.  But at the same time, they are complex.  And we'll need to work through all of them, hopefully in parallel.  But in my view, it's probably going to take longer than a year. ",

            "text": "All this goes back to the past couple of weeks and the reaction we've had from Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, who was also not happy about this deadline.  Basically, they are apparently, according to some Brussels officials, von der Leyen is now trying every trick in the book to delay Brexit.  And by delaying Brexit, they mean delaying the transition period.  If this happens, if they try to find something to do this, obviously, as we said before, the UK governments now have complete control over Parliament in Westminster.  They cannot technically force us to do that.  If they want to take us to the European Court of Justice, I'm hoping that Boris Johnson will stay strong against them.  And I think he will because he wants to have a good mandate as Prime Minister.  This has been his dream for a long time.  He's not going to destroy his premiership just to give some concessions to the European Union.  And we've had some reactions to Ursula von der Leyen on Facebook.  Jay says, We've been trying to get things sorted for four years.  Enough is enough.  They are trying every trick in the book to get the result overturned and make us stay.  Judy says, Dear Ursula, do it or don't.  We are not conceding anything else.  You have a year, no extensions.  Now all this has resulted in massive division across the whole continent among the EU 27 member states.  And before we give you the examples, this is Charles Michel, the head of the European Council, trying to calm things down. ",

            "text": "So he's trying his best to calm the situation, but it's slightly too late because everyone's kicking off.  First, it's Hungary.  Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, is now making a move against Emmanuel Macron.  And France is a hit out at the largest party and group in the European Parliament called EPP.  Viktor Orban is basically now massively criticizing the European People's Party because he says that the direction that they're taking is not right and it has to completely change.  He said that we're not interested in the EPP as it is today.  We're interested in the future EPP and the future should be completely different.  He said that this party and the whole group is now shifting from its traditional base and is becoming too liberal and too socialist and he wants it to be completely different.  This is the influence that people like Macron and certain parties in Europe have had over groups like the EPP and the European Parliament is now changing.  Now despite having various groups and parties and Macron and Merkel the two biggest players in the European Union have been supporting various different sides and now today even Angela Merkel has now been defending Macron over this whole situation.  but this is again bad timing for Germany because Germany is also in a very chaotic situation and Merkel is losing support every day in her own country.  so Merkel has had a difficult year and with only half of the Germans saying that they have confidence in her ability to lead the country And the latest polls show that, this is according to one of the German media groups, RTL, showing that the recession is actually getting worse in Germany and they could actually expect a proper financial problem in the next few months.  This is why only 41% of those surveyed have said that they have confidence in the Bundestag, the German parliament.  And this is down by 4% since the early 2019 last year.  And when it comes to support for the European Union in Germany, just 4 in 10 Germans back the European bloc.  4 in 10 support the European Union.  It's very interesting because when you listen to the mainstream media and what they portrayed in terms of the continent and especially countries like Germany who lead the European Union, they want you to think that basically almost 100% of Germans all support the European Union or at least 90%, at least 80%, 70%.  Not really.  It's 40% of people in Germany.  And these are the people who are more obviously liberal in mind.  They live in big cities.  They have the resources and the privilege and access to everything.  Obviously, they are going to be dependent on big governments, whether it's on a national level or continental level.  It's like here with London.  But the European Union have also made some other moves.  Somehow, the European Parliament are now kicking off over the flags of countries.  I mean, when they started this project, it was always going to be about, that's what they said, we are going to be a union, every country is going to be sovereign, they have to be respected, democracy and all that, and we're going to work together, it's all about cooperation.  Not really.  because only a few days ago this happened in the European Parliament.  So a number of the European Parliament officials have gone into the Brexit party MEP's offices and Nigel Farage's office and asked them to remove the union flags from their desks in their offices.  It's not like they were putting them on the street or like in a corridor in the middle of the actual building.  Nigel Farage said that we've just had our union flags removed from our desks in the European Parliament by the order of the president.  Apparently national symbols are now banned.  And he's right, because obviously if all nations have their flags removed, then how can increased federalism now be denied?  Now, according to Nigel Farage, the order actually came from Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission.  because they want to completely change the direction of Europe.  And so we thought people like Juncker or Donald Tusk were bad.  The new group, people like Wanderlei and people like Charles Michel, all these guys, they're even worse.  They are going completely towards federalism and destroying nation states as they are now.  So thank God we're leaving.  And this is why we're going to be proud of the end of January, 31st of January, that we are going to be slightly closer to be an independent country and we are that.  this is why we've prepared our new t-shirt designs.  a UK Independence Day 31st of January 2020 obviously comes in different colors and there are also different designs on the website.  I'll put the link in the description.  check out all the various designs that we have.  make sure you get your t-shirts now because we're gonna have a lot of Brexit victory parties towards the end of this month.  wear your t-shirts and to basically make Ramona's unhappy.  if you enjoy the content make sure you click on the subscribe button and on the bell next to it so you get notified when we release a new video.  videos come out every day at 5 45 p.m on my 2c and I'll see you guys tomorrow with a new video.
