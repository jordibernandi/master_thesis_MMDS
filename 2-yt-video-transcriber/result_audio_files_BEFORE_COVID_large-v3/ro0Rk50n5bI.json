When I found him about a month ago, he only had like 27 or 28, something like that.  But I wanted to make sure the channel is legitimate.  And he is legitimate.  Now the link I'm going to set up for you.  It's a video that I'm going to show a little clip of.  And in the video, he does a little bit of vlogging.  And he is actually asking for your opinion of the situation he was in.  I think he's looking to be educated.  And much like me, I'm always looking to be more educated by the auditors and you guys and the supporters.  and Because you can never learn too much, right?  You can never learn too much.  And you guys have, over the years, you have educated me quite a bit.  Because I was totally, completely ignorant to my rights.  And it's all because of you guys that I am much more aware.  And I like this guy opening up and asking for your opinion and for a little help.  So roll the clip. ",
