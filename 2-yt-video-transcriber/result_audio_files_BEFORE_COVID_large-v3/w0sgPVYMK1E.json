            "text": "When your situation's got you down.  Alright, let me start off by saying that I sat down with TRVR yesterday.  And we talked about this.  And let me start off by making this statement.  And you can find this anywhere on the internet.  Okay, so this is nothing new.  Break... Hussein Obama became $20 million richer after leaving the office of president than he was before he took office.  So, you know, that being the case, it's easy to see that he used the office of president to enrich himself.  Now, according to TRVR, Burek Hussein Obama is a shareholder in three insurance companies that offer Obamacare plans.  And this was his plan, according to TRVR, to use the office of president for profit.  Now, the only way that the medical industry can make money is to keep people sick.  And I mean, that's just a fact.  There are countries in the world where you don't pay your doctor unless you actually get well.  You pay for a service rendered, and if they render service and you don't get well, you don't owe them anything.  That's the way it should be in the United States, actually.  Now, it's a simple fact that we know how business works.  When insurance companies make a profit, they pay out to their shareholders.  And Obamacare is set up to pay out profits to the insurance companies.  And one of their shareholders, according to TRVR, holds a big stake in these insurance companies, is Boorake, Huson, Obama.  Now we also know that President Trump has said that Obamacare is a national disaster.  And we all know that Obamacare pays out so little to the patient that they can't afford the care, which keeps them sick, hence more profits to the shareholders, one of which is Burek, who signed Obama.  Now, this is in the media also, and we're going to slide over to Israel for a moment.  and uh this is you can find this on the internet but you know the liberal media the mainstream media is trying to play it down as a hoax and there's a reason for that.  it's called profit and so i'm going to read this to you right quick.  israel finds a cure for cancer.  scientists at an israeli biotech company say that they believe They will have a care for cancer within a year.  The cure consists of peptides, short strands of amino acids, developed by the scientists that latch onto multiple sites on a cancer cell at once, according to the Post.  By binding to multiple sites on a cancer cell, the treatment doesn't give the cell enough time to mutate again before another peptide in the same mix.  This one toxic to cancer cell, swoops in and eradicates the cancer.  Now, a long time ago in a video called Trump Derangement Syndrome, I made a joke saying that if Trump found a cure for cancer, that liberals would say he was violating their human rights and they have a right to have cancer and die.  And I made a joke about that until I sat down with TRVR and found out this stuff.  So it's not as far-fetched as it sounds and you might want to go through my list of videos and watch Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Now let's look at the Iran nuclear deal.  Now everybody knows that it was signed on to by Burek Hussain Obama and TRVR tells me that it was to create ISIS.  That's the reason that it was signed on to.  And to have a nuclear Iran and a nuclear Syria to threaten Israel.  And this was to distract Israel from working on the cure for cancer and to eventually eradicate Israel.  And thank God President Trump pulled us out of this deal.  Delaying the cure for cancer and eradicating Israel was the plan.  of the first Muslim president to profit from the office of president.  So, I mean, this is interesting stuff to look into, but TRVR has been a very good source.  So, I'll wrap up in the next segment.  Of course, now, we all know that Boorake, Hussein, Obama, is not the only one to use his office to profit, to profit himself and basically screw the American people.  We also know that Maxine Waters has used her office to benefit her husband's bank through tarp funds, appropriating tarp funds to bail her husband out, which, I mean, she's one of the most crooked politicians in Washington.  So I would love to see your comments on this and see what you guys think.  And that's the Giggling Conservative for today.  Y'all have a good one, all right? ",
