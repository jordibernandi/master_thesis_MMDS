            "text": "Hi, this is Dr.  Gregory Sadler.  I'm a professor of philosophy and the president and founder of an educational consulting company called Reason.io, where we put philosophy into practice.  I've studied and taught philosophy for over 20 years, and I find that many people run into difficulties reading classic philosophical texts.  Sometimes it's the way things are said or how the text is structured, but the concepts themselves are not always that complicated, and that's where I come in.  To help students and lifelong learners, I've been producing longer lecture videos and posting them to YouTube.  Many viewers say they find them useful.  What you're currently watching is part of a new series of shorter videos, each of them focused on one core concept from an important philosophical text.  I hope you find it useful as well. ",

            "text": "William James begins his essay, The Will to Believe, by making a number of important and useful distinctions about hypotheses and options.  And the reason why he's making these, these are sort of groundwork for the entire argument that he's putting forward ultimately about but also bearing upon many other objects of possible belief, judgment, opinion, what have you, controversy you could say as well.  So he's going to start out by talking about hypotheses And he says that a hypothesis is anything that may be proposed to our beliefs.  So everything running the gamut from scientific hypotheses, as he discusses later on in the work, such as mixing these two chemicals together will precipitate this out of the solution and create this sort of reaction, all the way to, Proposition such as God exists or God does not exist and everything in between, including things that you might say are of a very personal nature, such as I am in love with so-and-so or they're in love with me, or I should marry this person.  or I should intervene in this bank robbery or rather train robbery that's happening right now in front of me.  to use his famous example about the importance of belief in, you could say, social facts or hypotheses.  All of these can fall under the rubric of hypotheses.  And he makes a distinction early on.  that's going to turn out to be quite important.  He calls hypotheses live or dead.  And he says that we can talk about these as electricians talk about live and dead wires.  So a dead wire is one that no current is passing through.  And it's perfectly fine to handle.  A live wire, of course, will give you a shock.  But you can also do things with it.  It has some charge, some power, however you want to conceptualize it.  So he says, let us speak of any hypothesis is either live or dead.  A live hypothesis is one which appeals as a real possibility to him whom it is proposed.  And he notes just a little bit later that the deadness and liveness in a hypothesis are not intrinsic properties as many people tend to think that they are.  And they think that they're, because they make the mistake of assuming that their psychology or their mindset or their background is normative for all human beings everywhere.  What makes a hypothesis live or dead?  You can actually entertain it as a possibility for yourself or not.  So he says that it's going to be a relation to the individual thinker and it's measured by their willingness to act.  So there's a sort of continuum here.  It's not necessarily an on off switch, but he says the maximum of liveness in a hypothesis means willingness to act irrevocably, practically.  that means belief, but there is some believing tendency wherever there is willingness to act at all.  So it's things that we're willing to do something about.  We're willing to stake something on, right?  And he gives some examples.  If I asked you to believe in the Mahdi, which is probably going to be the same for everybody, well, at least most people watching this, he says, the notion makes no electric connection to your nature.  You might not even know what that term signifies.  It's a very important religious leader.  So he says that to an Arab, however, even if he be not one of the Mahdi's followers, the hypothesis is among the mind's possibilities, it is alive.  Not all Arabs, of course, but perhaps you could say, since one arose not too distant in time from James's address within, I believe, Sudan, that it would depend on where one is.  If I suggest to you that you should entertain working at Walmart, Perhaps 100 years in the future, if Walmart no longer exists, that would be a dead hypothesis for you, but for many, this could be a live hypothesis.  I actually have family members working for Walmart at this very time, so it's a possibility.  Now let's move on to options.  So James says that an option is a decision between two hypotheses.  So we've got one hypothesis on one side, one hypothesis on another.  They could be complete opposites to each other, but they might not be.  So, you know, I should marry this person, I should marry this person.  Those are in some respect opposed.  under the current laws, at least here in the United States, you cannot marry two people at the same time, although you could marry them sequentially, I suppose, marry this person, divorce them, marry this person.  The options or rather the hypotheses that are comprised within one single option need not necessarily be completely opposed to each other.  So he's gonna make three important distinctions here that allow us to classify the types of options that we make.  And I would suggest to you, that in order to understand this, you're not merely think about James's examples or the examples that I might put forward to you, but that you also try to think of examples in your own life, because if James is correct, these are concepts that apply to pretty much all of the options that we make in our own lives.  So the first is living or dead.  And he says, what makes an option a living option is that both hypotheses are living.  So it's not enough for one of them to be a living hypothesis.  You would have to have at least two and you could have more than, you know, two hypotheses in here.  James is just kind of keeping it simple.  So what would be examples of that?  He says, if I say to you, be a theosophist or be a Mohammedan, that is a Muslim, it's probably going to be a dead option because for you, neither hypothesis is likely to be alive.  Now he's addressing a crowd at a Christian college.  So He then says, if I say be agnostic or be a Christian, it is otherwise.  Trained as you are, each hypothesis makes some appeal, however small to your belief.  So each one is living to some extent.  We might think in political terms, those outside of the United States, if I propose to you, join the Republican Party and support it or join the Democrat Party and support that, that is probably not a live option to you.  You'd have to come here and it would have to have some sort of stake for you, but for most Americans, join the Democrats, join the Republicans.  That is definitely a live option, isn't it?  And we could have all sorts of options between one living and one dead.  It's not really a living option then.  The next one that he talks about is forced and avoidable.  So he says, if I choose between going out with your umbrella or without it, I'm not offering you a forced option.  You can easily avoid it by not going out at all.  Similarly, if I say love me or hate me, either call my theory true or call it false, your option is, as he would say, avoidable.  It's not forced.  Why?  Because there's a third possibility.  You could remain indifferent to me, neither loving nor hating.  You can decline to offer any judgment as to my theory.  But if I say either accept this truth or go without it, or we could say a logical compliment there, either accept this truth or anything other than accepting this truth with the entailments that that implies, then it is a forced option.  And there could be cases in practical life where by itself something is not actually forced, but it becomes forced within the circumstances.  Think about the example that we often use in talking about forced choices, the action movie where the villain has his gun to the spouse or the child's head of the hero and they say, drop your gun or I'm going to shoot, right?  And the hero now either has to decide, do I drop my gun or do I take the shot or do I talk more?  Drop the gun or anything else, right?  That's the forced option there.  So There could be cases where options are forced, even though it's not a logical disjunction, as he's saying.  Momentous versus trivial.  He uses a great example here and I think we can relate to this in many respects because at this point in time, at least the North Pole is still pretty inaccessible to most of us.  He says, if I propose to you to join my North Pole expedition, your option is momentous.  This would probably be your only similar opportunity and your choice would now either exclude you from the North Pole sort of immortality altogether, or at least put the chance of it into your hands.  He who is a wonderful phrase.  He who refuses to embrace a unique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried and failed.  So that's a momentous option.  You get your one shot.  If you don't take it, you've lost it.  It says the option is trivial and he gives three criteria here.  When the opportunity is not unique, when the stake is insignificant or when the decision is reversible.  So, you know, should I get a tattoo of Tweety Bird on my inner thigh?  You know, that's kind of a trivial one, right?  Because if I do get the tattoo, I can always have it removed.  It's hard to see how it's really gonna do very much.  And if I miss out on the opportunity to get it done now, then I can always go back to the tattoo parlor later on.  As a matter of fact, just as a side note, I think a lot of people get suckered into bad decisions because they think that decisions that they have to make, options that they have to engage in, are momentous when they're actually not.  When we're under the influence of, say, anger or drunk or all sorts of other things, we often make the mistake of thinking, we've only got this one chance.  I'd better say this now or I'll never get to say it, right?  But in many cases, the options are not actually such and they're trivial.  James is using these three distinctions to flesh out what he's going to call a genuine option.  a genuine option for him is going to be one that is living, forced and momentous.  So it has to satisfy all three of these criteria in order to be what he's calling here a genuine option.  That's part of the upshot of this.  And that's really what the entire lecture is circling around this concept of genuine options that we have to take and make when we have the opportunity. ",
