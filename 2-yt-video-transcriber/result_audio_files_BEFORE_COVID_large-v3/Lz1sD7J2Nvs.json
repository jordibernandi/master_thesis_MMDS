            "text": "Spill?  Y'all played yourselves.  What is up, fam?  It's your girl, Tia, and we've already talked about this a couple times now.  I felt like I had more or less said my piece on how I feel about the whole issue of corporate and planted YouTube channels springing up and masquerading as regular YouTube channels.  In the week since, Spill in particular has been the talk of the tube.  It's been springing up a lot as the subject of many recommended videos in my feed.  Much free publicity has been generated for the Spill Empire, largely due to YouTube normies like such as myself asking these questions about who's behind the channel.  Is this just some college student doing this in her spare time?  Is this a corporate run channel?  As for me, my take on Spill since day one has always been, yes, bitch, of course it's corporate.  What I'm saying is it had never occurred to me, and I know many of you out there, because we talked about this in the comments, it had never occurred to us that Spill was not a corporate channel.  Evidently, Spill had promised to their subscribers that they would do a big reveal of who was behind Spill once they hit a milli, but twist!  They did that big reveal about 100K ahead of schedule, I imagine because of all the chatter about who this channel was and who was behind it, and they didn't like it.  So Spill exposed themselves.  Except they didn't.  In their attempt to silence all of this speculation, about a week ago, Spill put out a propaganda video called How the Spill Universe Started.  And clearly I have entirely too much free time because I watched it.  They created this entire narrative about how they're just a couple of nice Canadians, and actually I do believe that part because I knew that to be true already, Thanks to you guys, by the way, who sent me the link to their social blade since I was too dumb to find it myself.  Long story short, this entire video was just a bunch of lies creating this story about how Spillz started out as two friends doing the channel together as a passion project.  And then as the channel became bigger and more successful, more people joined in and then they incorporated for tax purposes.  I'd estimate that I believed around 8% of the information disclosed in that video and that's if I'm being charitable.  One of the things that hurt their credibility the most for me was just that extremely contrived blooper of the car buys that kept happening when the narrator was trying to record her VO.  As usual, I can't prove that that was fake and I also don't care to actually try to, but that seemed blatantly staged to me.  The biggest red flag for me was when they showed their backend in YouTube and they showed all their videos that had been demonetized.  For those of you guys who don't make videos, and I'm sure that's probably most of you, when your video first gets demonetized, you can request a review.  Based on that review, YouTube will either remonetize the content or they will keep you demonetized because you are not James Charles.  To request this review takes approximately three seconds.  You click once to request the review and then you have to click once more just to assert that the content you're submitting is indeed advertiser-friendly, as far as you know.  Obviously, in the end, YouTube decides whether it is or it isn't.  In their video, Spill showed a screen of just top to bottom, nothing but yellow, demonetized dollar signs, meaning they hadn't bothered to do the two clicks it takes to request a review on even one of these videos, thereby forfeiting upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars, no doubt, because Spill gets a lot of views, which means a lot of AdSense coin.  Now I've heard a few of my YouTube compatriots speculate that Spill's failure to even attempt to remonetize this content is evidence of some larger conspiracy.  The most popular working theory that I keep hearing is that Spill is not concerned with earning money on these videos because earning money on them is not their primary objective.  What they really wanna do is take down the drama community on YouTube, the bag.  This theory is very popular at the moment and yet again, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because how can I put this nicely?  That makes no sense at all.  Even if taking down DramaTube is at the heart of the secret evil plan of these Canadians, earning money from extremely profitable content in the process is not mutually exclusive with that objective.  Spill is part of a corporation, even they've admitted it.  What corporation, what person isn't bothered with earning money from their product?  Occam's razor, you guys.  The simplest answer is usually the correct one.  The reason Spill has all of these demonetized videos in that screenshot is the screenshot is doctored.  It's fake.  Perhaps all of the videos they showed were demonetized at some point, but there is no way a corporation is going to let all that content sit there and not request reviews to get their content remonetized.  If this company can make a whole-ass animated series, they can Photoshop in some yellow dollar signs.  Give me a f***ing break.  It's a sympathy-slash-relatability play.  Like, oh, poor us.  We're just a little startup mom-and-pop Canadian drama channel, and we get demonetized all the time.  We don't even make any money.  We just do it because we love it.  Which in itself is an archaic way of thinking and line of defense.  Like who's still out here thinking that YouTubers shouldn't be able to monetize their content?  It takes a lot of time and work to make YouTube videos.  I don't think there's a single reasonable person out there who thinks that a YouTuber shouldn't earn a little or even a lot of AdSense for that work in 2019.  Regardless, Spill's propaganda video seems to have had the desired effect for them at least temporarily.  The most critical thinkers took everything Spill said in that video at face value and in true high of mind fashion then decided to direct their ire at the traditional drama channels calling them has-beens and jealous, this kind of thing.  But another twist, just a couple of days later, Petty Paige and her team, because I do feel like I've heard her say that she has researchers who help her, they released their own bit of investigative journalism.  They confirmed everything that me and several other YouTubers had already speculated and suggested, but didn't care enough to go out and like prove it.  Spill was never a passion project started by two friends.  It is one of several projects from a corporate entity, just like so many of us have been saying all along.  Furthermore, the company behind Spill and Brew and all the rest has existed for more than five years.  Seems to me that Spill is working with the same PR team that Jaclyn Hill uses because their entire strategy in exposing themselves was to just lie their asses off, allegedly.  Funny thing is, I personally don't really care too much that Spill is a corporate channel.  I only spoke on it in the first place as well as the other channels that I suspect are planned because I believe in transparency and I think that we should know what is happening with the content that we consume.  Plus, as I've said before, I personally find Spill's content to be leaps and bounds better in terms of research and production value when compared to your average drama channel.  that in and of itself sets them apart in a really good way.  However, when you go to such lengths to create this whole bull narrative about the company's origins, all in the hopes of, I guess, duping your audience into thinking that you're super relatable and just another YouTuber working away in her bedroom on her latest video, they really played themselves.  Because while I do concede that there's many of us, including myself, who do feel a certain reticence and uneasiness when we see companies verging in on what we see as our territory and trying to get in on this youtube thing it's also nothing new at all.  there have been corporate channels on youtube for ages now Vice, Tasty, Buzzfeed, the list goes on.  And though I tend to stay away from corporate content and I tend to only watch YouTubers who I see as actual people, I can also be objective enough to say that a corporate channel isn't inherently a bad thing.  They have resources and capital that people like me don't have and they're able to elevate the quality of the content on YouTube in a way that YouTube clearly wants.  In the end, people are going to watch what they like.  So if you're making content that people want to watch, which I would argue Spill is clearly doing, then let your product speak for itself.  But to lie to your audience is unnecessary, desperate, and pathetic.  By no means do I think this is the end of Spill.  The internet has the memory of a goldfish.  The people who actually believed every word that Spill said in their exposing ourselves video, well, that's a lost cause.  Independent thought is in extremely short supply on these YouTube streets.  Everyone else, they won't care about this in a week or two.  Spill will be fine.  I know a lot of us are bothered by this.  We're bothered by the fact that YouTube holds all the cards and that they're serving their own agenda.  But I'ma tell y'all something, and this is top secret, so keep it close.  Come here.  Come here closer.  You don't have to watch Spill if you don't want to.  I think a lot of us forget about the ace up our sleeve that we have as viewers, and that's free will.  If it really disturbs you down to the deepest pit of your core, to your very essence that these planted and corporate channels are taking over and getting all this shine, then don't watch them.  Let's vote with our views and show this platform what we want it to be.  They can only fudge their numbers so much.  Don't underestimate the power of your clicks, and more importantly, the power of what you don't click.  As for me, I'm probably not leaning toward clicking on any of their content if they show up in my recommended again.  As I said, I do think that their content is extremely well done, but I hate liars, man.  I hate them.  YouTube can promote whatever they want to ad nauseum and even phantom subscribe you to channels that you've never heard of.  I'm pretty sure phantom subscribe isn't a term, but we're going to roll with it.  They still can't make you watch or click on things that you decide not to watch or decide not to click on.  And we've got our trusty tinfoil hats to block out the mind control brainwaves that might make that possible.  Life hack.  All right, fam.  Hopefully you are two cents richer after hearing my thoughts on these latest developments surrounding the Spill Empire.  Thank you so much for keeping me company.  But before I get out of here, I will leave you with this, which is just a gentle reminder.  Never trust anyone with a Morphe code.  All right?  Bye-bye.  That's a nappy-headed wholesale. ",
