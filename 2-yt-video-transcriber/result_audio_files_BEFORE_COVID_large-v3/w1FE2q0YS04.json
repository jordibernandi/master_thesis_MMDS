            "text": "Everyone says go to college, get a job.  But what if you want more out of life than just a job?  What if you want meaning, purpose, and fulfillment in your work, your relationships, and every other area of life?  What kind of education would you need for that kind of life?  Today, the typical college experience is a narrow path.  Pick a major, focus your studies on one specific field or profession, and at the end, you're ready for that one field or profession.  At Hillsdale, we offer a different kind of education, a classical liberal arts education.  Studying the liberal arts creates a foundation for a liberated life, a life that's free and able to be lived well.  We do this at Hillsdale through a core curriculum designed to pursue what is good, true, and beautiful.  Every student at Hillsdale spends their first two years together, immersed in this core curriculum made up of the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences.  You'll still choose a major, but because of this core curriculum, that major will be built on a deep understanding of the nature of the world and the nature of humanity.  Practically, you'll learn to think deeply and critically, to solve complex problems, and to write and speak effectively.  Skills that are invaluable in any job and in every area of life.  Ultimately, a classical liberal arts education at Hillsdale means you won't just be ready for a job or career, you'll be ready for a good life.  Hillsdale, this is what college is meant to be. ",
