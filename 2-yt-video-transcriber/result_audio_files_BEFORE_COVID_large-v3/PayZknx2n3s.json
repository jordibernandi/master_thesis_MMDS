The full debate is linked below the video.  So if all you care about is watching the full debate, go click the link below the video.  But, um... The reason I want to show this is because this is how broadcast journalism should be conducting these sorts of debates.  You will not see anything like this on MSNBC or CNN, especially not in regards to Russiagate.  So this is two well-respected journalists that happen to be on different sides of this issue debating it.  But it's not just about the debate.  It's about Mehdi Hassan, the host here.  So Mehdi Hassan is actually equipped with... objective facts that relate to each of these journalists.  So he quotes each of them back to them.  So he uses their own words against them.  And he takes the position of being somebody that is actually neutral in this debate, but objectively neutral.  So objective to the facts, but neutral on the actual discussion.  So this is something that you will just not see on CNN or MSNBC.  And I Well, Fox News, I don't even, you know, really refer to.  But let me play this clip and you're going to see what I'm talking about. ",

So, look, I have no issue with editorializing.  I think it's fine to have an anchor that puts their spin on something, as long as they're open and honest that they are spinning.  Or not spinning, but they're open and honest about their bias and their opinion, how they lean politically and what they feel about the issue.  I'm okay with that.  But... There needs to be somebody like Mehdi Hassan on these networks that just is going to sit back and be objective to the facts, but neutral in the debate and have two people who are well respected and educated on their issues, on the issue, and be able to debate it.  with based in fact.  So you have someone like Mehdi Hassan pointing out Aaron Matei's prior words about Mueller and how he shouldn't be trusted.  And he also pushes back on David K. Johnston about calling Trump a Russian agent, which he called him one last week, which Trump obviously is not a Russian agent.  So This is something that more people... I mean, if you could have Mehdi Hassan teach a class to other journalists like Rachel Maddow and, I mean, the whole list, whether it's Anderson Cooper.  I mean, to have someone like Mehdi Hassan be able to maybe give his knowledge, give part some wisdom to these other broadcast journalists that do not at all do this... We could have actual real debates about these issues.  Now, clearly not every issue should be debated 50-50 like this.  I think Trump-Russia is actually a great debate to have because there is evidence on both sides.  Not on the collusion.  I mean, I don't want to get back into a Russian discussion.  But clearly, the Mueller investigation did not find collusion between Trump and Russia.  But that doesn't exonerate Trump from other possible crimes that he very likely committed, which is part of the reason why the full report has not come out, because that full report likely has some evidence to some other crimes.  So just because there is no Trump-Russia collusion about the election does not mean that Trump did not commit other crimes.  So there is evidence on both sides of this debate that you can point to.  You can talk about how Trump's foreign policy has actually been fairly critical of Russia or been on the side of not benefiting Russia.  But you can also debate that Trump's actions, his behavior has been sort of weird around Putin and Russia.  So there are points that you can hit on that can actually bolster two sides of this debate.  But this is not something that you necessarily see or even really have on any of these other broadcast networks. ",
