            "text": "You know what?  That's not a bad idea.  All right, y'all.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I want y'all to pay attention to what they're doing with regards to you being able to defend yourself.  And they're distracting you with all these other stories.  Real talk.  But I got a question, and I hope somebody out there can feel me on this.  What have we become?  Well, we are the kind of creatures that we just stand around and stare at somebody while they die.  Nobody thinks to help anymore.  Nobody knows any life-saving skills anymore.  Nobody believes in preserving the soul or the spirit of a dying person.  They just stand there, spectate.  I must have missed the memo.  When did we?  when did we become this type of society?  Because that's some cold hearted.  I mean, heartless.  What did you miss in your upbringing?  that you don't put any value?  On human life at all.  I mean, you know, maybe you think it's cool.  Maybe you think it makes you hard.  Maybe you think this is how you got to be to survive in the world.  But you misunderstand how valuable life is.  I mean, people act like, you know, you living on autopilot.  No, every day that you get up that you still know your name and you can still count how many fingers and toes you got.  And you know your name and you can focus.  That's a day that a lot of other people don't get.  So y'all just, I mean, this is not a video.  This is not a game.  Now people's lives are messed up.  People are locked up now.  People are dead.  And I'm just wondering, what have we become?  You know, it was bad enough when we had the lady on the train and the bro went off and kicked the old lady.  Y'all remember that?  That was bad enough.  Ain't?  nobody do nothing.  People just watch.  People videotape.  Girl got dragged out in the Waffle House and they showed all her goodies and people, bros, just stood there and videotaped.  But to stand there and videotape this 16-year-old little boy bleeding out because he done got stabbed and everybody just laughing.  and what kind of animals have we given rise to?  I'm going to call it like it is.  What kind of households are producing these types of creatures?  Because this is supposed to be the future.  I don't know what it's going to take.  You know, we always want to talk about, you know, I ain't going back to slavery, and I'm not what I'm not going to do, and can't nobody make me do nothing, and I'm me, and we always quick to want to handle each other in the most heinous ways, but still can't get together and be unified as a race and practice group economics and pull ourselves up and build our own financial base, which leads to our own political base, which gives us some pull.  Still can't do that, but we can still do this ignorant shit right here, and I'm just... I'm talking to that generation.  What did y'all miss?  These little phones got y'all messed up, huh?  Everybody's a news reporter now.  It's more important to you to get views and to get likes than it is to help somebody.  What has happened?  You know, listen, let me explain something to you.  Look, look, look, look.  Everybody is not a star.  Everybody is not going to be the person that's going to be the center of attention.  Sometimes just be glad to be on the team.  Everybody on the ground is fronting.  Things ain't what you think they is with a lot of these folks.  I meet a lot of y'all, and I can be the first one to tell you that when I meet you in person, come on, reality sets in.  But y'all taking this way too serious.  When you see somebody getting killed, you know, people getting beat down, you know, all kind of crazy.  And y'all standing there, you laughing because you think it's cool because you got it on video.  Man, make you look like a coward.  You understand what I'm saying?  You know, if I'm out there, yeah, I'm going to start off taping.  Then you're going to hear me say, here, hold this.  And then I'm in the video.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm no longer filming a video.  I'm like, damn, Jay jumped in his own video.  So I'm fucking people up.  That's amazing.  You know what I'm saying?  They be interviewing me in about two scenes.  They go to the brother that shot the video and he go to the defendant all at the same time.  But I don't see that.  Y'all standing around, let this boy die.  And now all of a sudden everybody got a nerve to look pitiful when they drag your ass off the jail.  Don't y'all understand that the justice system really don't give a damn about black people.  But white folks, if you get caught up in it, they all cannibalistic on your own people.  Y'all be like so big.  They have no problem sacrificing one of their own just to keep a system in place that's designed to keep us one step away from slavery.  So come on now.  I don't get it.  Y'all lost me on that one.  I missed the memo.  When did we become so cold and callous that we stand around and it's more important to videotape?  You know what?  I bet if they started making you videotape some shit, you'd become an accessory to the crime if you didn't help.  I bet y'all stop videotaping then.  I bet y'all stop screaming world star then.  I bet y'all stop trying to get shit on the shade room.  It's all about everybody chasing this clout.  Because you think that this five minutes of fame makes you a star.  Y'all don't want this life.  It's not all it's cracked up to be.  Y'all keep acting like.  y'all want this attention.  Trust me, you really don't want this attention.  Because there's crazy motherfuckers out here that'll be sitting back.  They don't give you some attention, too.  And all of a sudden, you become who you truly are.  You out here fronting like you this, that, and the third.  And then when reality come knocking at your damn door, all of a sudden, you want to call the police.  It's too late for all that.  Ain't doing all that.  No, you, like they say, you know, you keep knocking on the devil's door.  Sooner or later, somebody going to answer.  And just think about that.  Who the fuck you think is hanging behind the door with the devil?  So anybody open the door, that's your ass.  Y'all understand what I'm saying?  And as a people, that's exactly what we doing.  Now we got kids standing around watching kids get killed.  I'm sorry.  I missed something.  When did that shit become cool?  I mean, come on, somebody let me know.  When did we get to a point where we think it's cool now?  You know, like, nigga, that's your problem.  You got fucked up.  Really?  You know what?  It's amazing to me how cruel we can be to each other, but we can't band together to put up a front against the people.  that's cruel to all of us.  I don't get that shit.  I don't want to have nothing to do with it.  But you're standing there witnessing this shit.  Well, come on, come on.  They call it a smartphone.  But y'all motherfuckers just make you dumb.  You got all the knowledge in the world in your hand.  And all you care about is trying to find the most decrepit shit that you can be a witness to, to put it up there on some damn social media so that you can get a few likes.  Get the fuck out.  That is the weakest.  Go out and make some friends.  Go out and learn to socialize with people.  Get out the goddamn house.  Put the phone down.  Put the phone there.  Let me see.  Matter of fact, I'd like to see y'all try to survive without a phone for about a week.  Man, you motherfuckers would be going crazy.  I don't even see they got y'all addicted to this shit.  Addicted.  And now to the point where you're standing and watch a young boy die.  Now all y'all standing around.  Well, goddamn.  With help like that, who needs enemies?  And then ain't nobody out there got no skills.  Ain't nobody help my man.  But everybody gangster.  It's all funny games till the bullets start flying, huh?  Last time I checked, I drove through the hood.  I ain't seen no gun stores.  Last time I came through the hood, I ain't seen no ammo stores, gunsmith stores.  I ain't seen none of that.  But I go up in the suburbs with white boys that I see gun stores all day.  Matter of fact, I saw a house that had been turned into a gun store.  I fell up in there.  They had some nice shit.  They were like, how did you find us?  Like, motherfuckers say gun store out front.  I fell up in here.  What y'all got?  But you don't see them trying to disarm them.  But this case right here proves something.  Y'all still ain't caught on to where I'm going with this.  He ain't shoot him.  He stabbed him.  So what y'all gonna do next?  Y'all gonna ban knives next?  You gonna have motherfuckers in the kitchen who can't cook and be upset.  Like, well, you know, I would normally make this pound cake, but they done banned the knives.  Because guns don't kill people.  People kill people.  And until y'all can come to grips with that and classify people as they should be, we're going to keep on having this same damn problem.  Y'all running around talking about we've got to control the guns.  No.  You have to be able to control the people.  And y'all can't do that right now.  Why?  Because it's a free country.  That's what y'all said.  So that basically means this is the only place on earth where you can say and do what the fuck you want and not fear knocking the door in the middle of the night.  Oh, y'all trying to get us there, but we ain't there yet.  Big shout out to all my brothers out there that's finding their sites shut down because they say you went too far.  I keep telling y'all, be facts over feelings.  Don't get all amped up.  They scared of the angry black man.  You want to scare them, outthink them.  They're more terrified of our unity than they are of our rage.  Now, don't get me wrong.  The rage is cool, too, because if we got to get it into the Zulu mode, I'm good with that.  But we got to outthink people.  This is a game of chess.  And if you understand anything about chess, play on a flat board.  But then you get folks like us who think in three dimensions.  While y'all thinking forward and backwards and left and right, we're thinking up and down, too.  We're three-dimensional thinkers.  I don't know what we done became.  Y'all let that boy die in your videotape.  I don't even want to see the videos.  I don't want to see the videos.  There's heinous shit happening all over the world.  Y'all seen the video where the boy died in the cell in Georgia.  They didn't give him no water for three days.  So basically he died of thirst.  In a suicide watch room, y'all know I don't spoke on suicide watch rooms before.  They lied and claimed that they were checking on him every 15 minutes.  My man was, by the time they went in there to check on him, rigor mortis had set in.  His family sued and they didn't want to let the videotape out.  The videotape came out recently.  This shit happened back in 2018.  But now that the video came out, they want to reconsider and settle out of court.  See, I'm trying to tell y'all at the end of the day, there's no such thing as a police officer.  That is a job title.  You are dealing with human beings and we are some of the most dangerous creatures on the face of the earth.  Given our own, left to our own devices, we can be some of the most cruelest, heinous, imaginatively painful, inflicting creatures on the face of this earth.  Whether we do it to you physically, psychologically, sexually, we don't care.  That's just how we are, man.  So y'all got to stop acting like... Because they have a certain job, they're above human behavior.  And some of us by species are more crazier than others.  As a matter of fact, I don't care how y'all try to explain it.  You can have all the intelligent moments of reflection you want, but white people are inherently insane by their DNA.  That's why they flip the fuck out and do crazy shit that we don't do.  Whenever we do something to somebody, our anger is very directed.  If we shoot up somebody, we meant to shoot the people that got shot.  If we come in to burn the building down, the only people that's going to get burnt up is the ones we meant to be in there.  We don't have it in our DNA to do crazy psychotic shit like they say.  You know what?  Just fuck everybody.  I'm just going to kill the world today.  That's not in our DNA.  It's in their DNA.  But then again, we're not perfect either because we got high self-esteem and low racial esteem.  We'll fuck somebody else up quick.  that look like us, but we will not get together and band together as a group, moving in, pulling out resources, fighting as a crew.  We won't do that.  And I don't know what it's going to take.  You know what?  I'm going to tell you the truth.  I gave it some thought.  I'm going to tell you what it'll take.  that will make everybody don't care who you are.  If you got brown skin, it'll make you figure out we need to get our shit together because we're out of time.  What the hell y'all going to do?  I don't want to hear no more speeches.  I don't want to sit on no more bullshit as panels and say shit that we've been saying all along.  Now, I guess because certain people say it now, all of a sudden, everybody paying attention.  Spare me that bullshit.  I'm talking about the action.  I'm talking about when the shit pop off, who's going to really do shit and who's not going to do shit in the whole nine yards.  Let me tell y'all something.  For most folks, it's a lot of talk.  That's cool.  Play your position.  But the one thing they could do to make all of us respond, and y'all think, oh, they said they could never pull off 9-11.  They pulled that shit off.  Wake up tomorrow morning and find out that they took some type of secret vote and some type of executive action and they done repealed the 13th Amendment, which means they can throw your ass back into slavery as soon as somebody go out and catch a nigga.  You got until 12 o'clock.  It's free.  Just grab your wine.  Gunpoint if you have to.  Y'all will wake up tomorrow and try to figure out what the fuck is going on.  on.  They trying to put us back in slavery and they don't change the law.  They don't snuck some shit through.  Y'all be like, no, that can't happen.  Oh, it might be some shooting in the street for a minute.  People might get upset for a minute, but eventually some of y'all are punk.  I didn't go along with this shit, but the rest of us can probably be like ride or die.  But at the end of the day, everybody got to make a choice.  That's the kind of shit it's going to take for y'all to get a wake up call.  And for y'all, I don't think that shit can happen.  Y'all need to do some reading.  Most of these scenarios that they run against y'all are in books right around you.  9-11 came out of a Tom Clancy novel.  Y'all already talked about that.  Run some planes into the building, scared the fuck out of the people, start a war.  Come on now.  Come on, be smarter than that.  I can't believe they let this little boy die and everybody was.  Young brothers out there, come on.  What's on y'all mind?  What's on y'all mind, bruh?  What you so angry about?  that?  you hate your own kind to the point where you don't give a damn about nobody's life, including your own.  But you won't let.  no, you won't try to get no help.  You won't try.  You just run around, you know, victimizing everybody else with your poison.  You got sisters out here twisted too.  They don't got some backwards ass education.  Blind leading the blind and they out victimizing bros too.  Shit go both ways.  We got that demographic in our people.  We got to clean up.  But y'all taking it to a whole nother level.  Come on now.  I don't ever want to think of my own people as being potential enemies.  But some of this shit y'all doing to protect what we got left, y'all got to become the target too.  Y'all think about that.  I got to bounce.  We on some different shit.  They still the rap.  And watch the boy bleed and they videotaped it.  Did nobody do nothing?  Y'all some cold-blooded men.  Oh, my God.  I'm good.  I'm gone, y'all.  Y'all think about that.  Holler at your boy.  Peace. ",
