            "text": "welcome and today I wanted to share some what I'm gonna call reset junk.  and it was actually this picture right here that intrigued me when considering reset junk.  and this picture is Wabash and Washington Chicago, after the great fire of 1871.  And, you know, here's just a little taste of remains of what our world used to look like here in America.  And not the type of ruins that we would expect for 1871.  Columns scattered everywhere.  What look like pipes.  And metal.  And here we see the same Wabash in Washington.  Now in 1891.  So in 20 years, really strange.  You know, I just can't imagine that this is the exact same place.  But they're telling us it is.  So this whole entire city here seems to have been rebuilt in 20 years.  If this is this corner of Wabash and Washington in Chicago, what can create such ruin?  And what kind of people can create such material and infrastructure to create such ruin?  I mean, just doesn't really seem to make any sense.  So what's lying in ruin, we're really not even recreating today.  And very interesting that many of these columns do appear to be hollow and found throughout the world.  And this seems to be more in a recent time.  And what we can see here is in previous times, They were not hollow, but they were a type of facade.  Even the most ancient of structures that we think were carved were not carved at all.  And here we can see a little more clearly.  We see what looks like a river rock as the column core.  And then merely surfaced.  with this facade, some kind of a cement plastering.  And here it's breaking off and revealing actually what this is made out of.  And perhaps the column was older.  And I think what we're seeing with Martin's work is perhaps the Tartarians built the first layer, you know, all the brick and the stone, and later the Phoenicians come in and resurface everything with these facades, these beautiful facades.  But the speed in which things seem to have been done according to the narrative that they give us just seems absolutely unrealistic in every way.  And this one was depicting Dubai in 1985.  And really just seeming like a blast zone, very similar to what we see in the Nevada deserts.  with roads lying underneath.  In this case, the roads appear to have been repaved, but what we would see in the desert is something very similar with no buildings and remains of roads and grids and layouts of previous cities.  And if you haven't seen some of my past videos, I show some of these out in the California desert and New Mexico, Nevada.  Now these exist everywhere.  And as you can see here, you know, civilization is about 10 miles away, 10, 15 miles here, and yet a complete development.  And these maintain themselves.  No maintenance is required.  These roads seem to define nature.  No bushes grow in them.  No grass.  Totally preserved from the elements in a way that we could never do.  So really seeming like the footprint of something that we really don't know about.  I don't think they were neighborhoods, although we turn them into neighborhoods.  And even if we turn on the roads here, we can see that they've gone as far as to even name every single one of these.  and just a real joke.  obviously this is not what it was and we can see the same thing in all parts of the world including this one in the New Mexico desert.  I really like this one as well just outside of the small town here and yes these are just absolutely everywhere and we come along and we build our neighborhoods and our cities right on top of them.  so this is a fine example of repurposed engineering on a very foundational level And if development continues to sprawl, all of this will be erased.  Future generations would have no idea what was underneath them.  And what are all of these?  I mean, this is one of the greatest mysteries lying right under our feet.  And pretty easy to build on an existing infrastructure.  And here I wanted to show this San Juan Cathedral.  And this is pretty recent.  I mean, 1943.  And we're going to look at a difference of one year here.  and this is located in a small village in Mexico and they're telling us that two little villages were buried beneath ash and lava.  and I just found it really fascinating to have a look at this architecture.  and some people say that the village is an urban legend and does not exist but we will clearly see photos of it here.  and this I believe is going to depict what we may consider to be mud floods at times, and perhaps how a mud flood is created.  And yes, I believe in so many different theories.  I think we see examples of many different scenarios that could lead to the understanding of a mud flood.  In this particular example, we're going to look at a volcano.  And so here we see this church and this base level, at least two stories here, at least 20 or 30 feet, just on this base structure, not counting the spire and dome here.  And then after the volcano in 1944, let's have a look at this very same church.  and yes you know all we see is the spires sticking up and the volcano still shooting smoke in the background after one year and really amazing i mean to consider that in one year we have 20 to 30 feet of debris.  you know this entire section of this building is now underneath ash.  And, you know, give a little bit of time and this is just going to resemble dirt.  And pretty soon trees will grow on it and people will arrive on the scene.  There'll be grasses and they'll just see this sticking up, you know, and not realize that they're actually building their homes and walking amongst the ruins in this case of a, of a small development, but in some cases of entire cities.  And that's exactly what we see all across this plan.  No longer do these trees exist or any of these homes or people for that matter.  Everything erased except just the very highest points.  And here we go.  I mean, here is what we have.  And we see absolute burial of this beautiful church.  And really almost seeming like a church within a church.  I would like to study this a little bit more.  But here, have a look.  So there we go.  You know, this is a little taste.  of what was once a glorious structure in what seemed to be full glory in 1943 and now completely buried.  All that we see is the top sticking up and no luck for the rest of this little village.  And here's another little look.  and we do see the growth now beginning to move back in and engulf this structure in good time.  And next I wanted to share this image of the Salt Lake Temple.  You know, I recently did a video on the subject.  And as usual, all the good stuff came after in your comments.  And I wanted to show this burial of the Salt Lake Temple.  I found this to be a really amazing picture.  This was featured in the Deseret News, a mainstream newspaper.  And just the other day, I was actually standing right here in this stairwell, and I photographed those doors that I showed.  And in here, we actually see what looks like where the statues may have been.  This is going to be 1963.  Here's a picture of construction, which may never be seen again.  the sandstone sub-foundation to the granite foundations under the main entrance of the Salt Lake Temple.  So here later in time they were doing some renovations.  Again, if this is 1963, so what?  63 years later, after its absolute completion, they're telling us that they went back in, dug it out, and look at this aging.  And look at these different segments.  I mean, clearly the temple went down lower.  And I don't think this is just foundation.  This looks like it used to be the old entrance right here.  And later these steps have been added to create a new entrance.  And we can also see the windows.  The original glory of the windows and their fullness.  And later have been turned into little half windows.  And really amazing.  I mean, this is not the foundation.  This is the foundation down here.  These old, old blocks that are almost looking like the base of a pyramid.  Really amazing.  And a picture that will seldom be seen.  And these kind of blocks, I mean, just absolutely megalithic seeming.  And how far down does this structure really go?  I mean, as far as we can see, these stones have been worked a long time ago.  And here again, we get a little look.  Just mind-blowing.  I mean, these stones are amazing enough, but then to think there's a whole structure underneath it.  And, you know, I think that the article was really questioning, even the mainstream was questioning, whether it was built on a granite or a sandstone foundation.  That was the whole premise of the article.  and really amazing as you can see here what would have been the original entrance and these stairs being more recent and here they're telling us that they are cleaning it up they removed the patina of age from granite walls of the salt lake temple to match the new granite of the temple annex soon to rise on the north side of the temple.  And really just, you know, here again, the soil compaction just seeming like this is the first time this has ever been dug up.  Not seeming like it was made by the pioneers only 50, 60 or so years earlier.  But to build at least 30 or so feet underneath, now this changes everything.  And here, look how deep the man is.  And he's clearly pointing at the older work.  I mean, who worked on this?  And we can see an old entrance here, just filled in now.  I mean, again, not seeming foundationary at all.  Seeming like part of the structure just continues on down and has been buried.  And really, quite a bunch of infrastructure being unearthed here.  Completely hollow under here, and yet bushes growing on top.  Really not seeming to make any sense.  and yet at the same time making a lot more sense, looking at it with the different perspective that we do.  So that's it for today.  I do hope you enjoyed the video, and do have a blessed day.  Please like, comment, and subscribe. ",
