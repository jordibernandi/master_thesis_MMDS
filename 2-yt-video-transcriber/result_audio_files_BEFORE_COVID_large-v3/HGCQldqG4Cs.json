            "text": "Well, I mean, when I first kind of realized I was gay and I accepted myself as a gay Muslim, I slowly, I mean, after a few months after that, I kind of, you know, got in contact online with a group of other progressive Muslims.  It's called Muslims for Progressive Values.  They've got associate status at the UN, I believe.  and it's an American Muslim organization and they're very like.  they advocate for gay rights and you know being gay is okay in Islam and you know they're very progressive and very liberal.  just like my views were at the time and you know I befriended them talked to them a lot and I felt more comfortable and then slowly I started coming out to all of my closest friends.  I came out to seven people in person individually.  every single one of them was Muslim And to my shock and surprise, every single one of them accepted me.  Because these people were the people that were the closest to me, the ones that I trusted, the ones that I cared about a lot, and they cared a lot about me.  Now, whilst they might not have necessarily accepted that all being gay is okay in Islam, they accepted me as a person, and they were still friends with me.  They still liked me as a person.  And I was very surprised at that, because I was pretty sure at the time before I kind of came out to them that at least some of them would kind of, you know, turn away and just reject me.  But that wasn't the case.  So I came out to them and then, you know, at this stage I was very progressive and stuff.  You know, because, you know, I'd become really progressive and liberal, at this stage I kind of, I didn't believe that heaven, Jannah, was limited to just Muslims.  I believed it was open to everyone.  Atheists, agnostics, Christians, Jews, whatever.  If you're a good person, you'll go to heaven.  That was kind of the understanding of Islam I had at that time.  So for me now, actually kind of going back and questioning religion wasn't scary at all.  And I just naturally kind of, because I'd changed my views on evolution and on radical Islam and then on my sexuality, I just thought, one day, I just thought, hmm, what about the whole concept of religion?  I started questioning the entire concept of religion and revelation.  And that was actually really easy.  And when I kind of looked into that, I started reading a lot of stuff from Richard Dawkins, watching a lot of his interviews and debates.  Read a lot from Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and a few other kind of big atheists.  And I realized, actually, they made a lot of sense that the whole concept of revealed religion wasn't very reasonable.  So at that time, I then basically just left Islam.  And that was not hard for me at all.  At all.  The hardest thing for me was actually becoming de-radicalized.  This, in comparison, was nothing.  It didn't even feel very kind of... I mean, it was emotional, don't get me wrong.  But in comparison, it was nothing at all. ",
