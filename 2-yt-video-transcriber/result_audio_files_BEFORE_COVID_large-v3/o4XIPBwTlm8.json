            "text": "Your power's a weak old man.  You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.  This is strange about this SYSBM and people are losing their goddamn minds.  Okay.  Low cast.  Low cast.  Come on, man.  Get out of your female feelings, man.  Shaming tactics do not work.  Okay.  They don't work.  Logic works.  And all you're bringing is shaming tactics.  You haven't given black men a reason not to go.  Have you?  What is it?  Pride?  Legacy?  Really?  So all the facts that we bring up don't mean anything.  Because that's the whole thing.  All you guys have is talking points and feelings.  You don't have nothing to back it up.  Because if you try to back it up, guess what you're going to find?  You're going to find the same things that we found.  Why do you think SYSBM and Itmore before that and MGTOW before that and the wall of silence before that, and the gender war going all the way back to 2006, and the online gender war that used to fight the news was back in 1992.  Same damn thing.  This is not new.  I found video going all the way back to 1960 saying this exact same thing.  Your literature going all the way back to the 18th century, the 19th century, mid-19th century, 1850s, 1860s, say the same thing.  Black people have a major dysfunction in the first starts with the woman.  OK, if we can't clean it up, which I don't think we can, because we don't have two or three generations to clean it up to reverse all this bullshit that's gone on for the last, I would say, 56 years is going to take three generations to clean it up.  We ain't got that time.  In fact.  It's over already.  They're going to mix.  They're already mixing.  The only thing that you can do, which is something I told all the women, you don't want to mix.  You don't want to go anyplace.  Take them out of the schools.  Open up your own black schools.  Stop sending your kids to white dominated schools, white oppression school system schools next to white and Latino girls.  Don't want to do that.  Don't even talk to me about this because it's already over.  Doesn't matter.  The people in S.Y.S.B.M.  are already married.  They already have girlfriends.  They already have girlfriends that are out of the country.  There's one dude that was on my panel.  He's got 58,000 people in his Facebook group that travel on a regular basis.  You're trying to sell something that doesn't have any value.  The guys have already come back to the table.  The ones that will come back to the table have already come back to the table and said, wait a minute, we're settling for this?  We're settling for these attitudes?  I've had women say that... Women are not going to get straight until guys leave in enough numbers.  Basically, that's pretty much happened already.  The thing is, it hasn't happened to the older women.  The women that are talking hasn't happened to them because they have been indoctrinated differently.  Those Zs, I should say late millennials, they're already gone.  They're already gone.  People like my son, they're already gone.  They're not coming back.  And first thing they would say, I don't want to date anybody like my mother.  Usually, you look for someone like your mother.  You don't anymore.  They don't anymore.  You can't shame them into coming back.  Now, you can come up with talking points and shaming tactics like, we're bitch-ass niggas.  Okay, well, fine.  We're bitch-ass niggas.  You're calling us bitch-ass niggas before that.  That's not going to do any good because there will be all kinds of bitch-ass niggas to be happy.  I have pro-black... hardcore conscious community people that do not want to go any places.  But the thing is, the steady situations with black women have gotten so bad, they're thinking about jumping the fence.  Really don't have to jump it because the fence is down anyway.  All they want to do is have peace of mind.  Come home to a woman.  that's decent.  It's not going to stress them out.  I can't even get a woman on the panel, on one of my panels, to come up and actually talk normally.  They don't even come up because they know what they're going to do.  They're going to embarrass themselves.  They're going to be a prime example of why guys should leave.  And then all of a sudden they say, I'm not like that in real life.  BS.  Bullshit.  So when I said you and your female feelings, you are because you're using the same tactics that women use.  Men use logic.  Not I'm going to put my nuts on.  Nobody cares if you put your nuts on the table.  You can leave them there for all we care.  At the end of the day, you're going to sound just like them.  You're going to become them.  You've got two choices.  Either solve the problem, which is offer these dudes a better deal, or you shut up and go someplace else.  Attacking mad bus driver is not going to do anything.  Mad bus driver is one dude.  And no matter what he says, if other guys aren't listening, it's not going to do any good.  We're not zombies.  We're not children.  We're not little drones that follow behind somebody.  that sounds popular.  Mad bus driver had a small channel and a tiny following until you blew him up.  With your dumb asses, you're following the same mistake that the people that went at MGTOW did.  The same stupid ass mistake.  MGTOW was a small following until people like you came over to MGTOW started complaining, started trying to shame them, started trying to out them, and guess what happens?  They blew up.  Nobody talked about S-Y-S-B-M four years ago.  I know all them dudes, right?  Know all them dudes.  Some dudes used to come to my channel and they used to complain that how come the black community wasn't better?  How come they weren't appreciated even though they were doing well?  And why they decided to marry out?  They came to my channel four or five years ago.  I told them, hey, you have no obligation to stay.  And then right after that, I produced a video called Should Educated Lames Leave the Black Community?  We argued at that point.  The answer was yes.  If you can't get what you want where you are, go someplace else.  That's what men have done for hundreds of thousands of years.  You can't get what you want someplace else, you move.  Go someplace else.  You don't stay there to put up with dumbass conditions.  You go someplace else and make it better.  It's called a fresh start, which is how this country was actually founded.  They had piss-poor conditions in Europe.  A lot of them were dying early.  The rich people were taking up all the land.  They couldn't feed themselves, so they came over here for a new start.  That's how America started.  It's been that way for eons.  To say that we have to stay in poor-ass conditions with uncooperative women is bullshit.  And the thing is, what you guys really know, that you have nothing to sell.  That is the problem.  You got nothing to sell.  You, what they all say, that misery loves company, that's all it really is.  If you really wanted to change something, be out there changing it.  Or you at least be coming up with ideas and strategies to change it, which you haven't and you aren't.  Because at the end of the day, none of this stuff makes any difference.  At the end of the day, it doesn't.  You need to have enough money, enough clout, or enough power to stop the process that started back in 1945.  I said the middle generation, which was the Z's, are going to vote on the direction of the black community.  And the Z's are voting with their feet.  Ricky Smiley's little boy, His teenage son was just an indicator.  what was already there.  When Ricky Smiley's son came out and said, I only date white girls, I already knew what was up because my son was doing the same thing.  I have never seen my son bring home a black girlfriend in his whole entire life.  Latina, Asian, and mixed.  That's it.  And all of his buddies are following suit.  That is called the handwriting on the proverbial wall.  And there's nothing that you can do about it.  You can put your nuts on the table.  You can get other people's nuts and put it on the table.  You can get a whole round table of what they call black versus pro-black and put their nuts on the table.  You can't stop it.  The only way to stop it is to actually get these women to act better so that you can slow it down.  And these women are not about to act better.  They're not about to change their attitude.  not about to become cooperative.  so at the end of the day it's over.  sysbm is just a symptom it's not a cause.  sysbm is a hashtag.  okay anybody can put up tenants.  anybody can put up what they stand for when you read the tenants they're actually very reasonable.  what is wrong with the matrix is called choice.  choice.  get out of your female feelings.  Use your head.  This had chaos rain on my channel.  But the same thing.  Get out of these freaking female feelings.  Use your head.  Use your logic.  How do you fix the problem?  Is SYSBM really the problem?  No, it's not.  Because everybody I talk to, they're SYSBM.  And they don't even say anything.  Because they don't want the heat.  They just leave and don't say nothing.  I would say one out of 100 guys will say something.  One out of 100 guys will say something.  There's guys right in the camp.  that have already gone to what they call the dark side, right in your midst.  They're just not saying anything.  You react on feelings.  You react on talking points.  Pick up something and read for a doggone change.  Use your head.  Use some logic for a doggone change.  Because if you don't, you're going to sound just like the women. ",
