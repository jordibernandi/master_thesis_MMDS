            "text": "Proof that Redditors are NPCs.  Hello everyone, this is Mr.  Obvious, bringing you the obvious.  And today, on the Hacker4chan, we've got a story for you.  So here in Anon says, Holy crap man, Redditors are confirmed NPCs.  Check out this thread about a girl who says her boyfriend has... Appphantasia, which apparently is an inability to visualize things in your mind.  Comments is all redditors saying that they never even knew that other people could literally envision things in their mind and that they thought it was just a figure of speech when they heard stuff like that.  WTF man.  Actual real life honest to god NPCs.  And most of them are on reddit, naturally.  Think about this in conjunction with the original threads that started the NPC meme, about how so many people don't have any inner dialogue, according to studies.  And then consider the top of it.  NPCs are real, man.  This must be an effing simulation.  So we're gonna take a look at, um, these screencaps that they provided, and examine the situation.  Okay, so here we go.  MickArthurWilly says, I found out I had appphantasia here on Reddit a couple months ago.  Somehow, I made it all my life thinking people visualizing was just an expression too.  Edits.  I never would have imagined this comment would have so much attention.  Not that I could have.  I try to answer people's questions below, blah blah blah.  Okay.  Agent K says, Edit 3.  There have been a lot of people in the comments who are starting to think they have aphantasia as well.  And I think it might be partially my fault for describing it so poorly.  Not everyone can see literal images in their heads.  Sometimes it's shadowy, sometimes just blurry.  Sometimes inside their heads, and sometimes outside.  Sometimes it isn't a literal image, but the idea of one.  I have none of those.  If you cannot picture an object in your head in any way, you might have aphantasia.  Wait, how did you find out?  Do people normally have literal images appear in their head?  I've never been able to see actual images in my head.  Not one image with my eyes open or closed has ever manifested in my mind.  If you ask me to visualize an object, I can list off the characteristics that is common to them, but I can't visualize it in my mind.  Edit.  My mind has been blown.  I have never seen images in my head, and I thought it was completely normal.  That explains a lot, and I'm kind of in shock.  Edit 2.  I just found out that normally people can visualize faces, and if you were normal, and if I were normal, I could do the same.  I'll never be able to visualize my wife or my family's face because something's wrong with my brain.  I almost wish I hadn't discovered this.  So look, I don't want to be mean here.  He's lying.  But if this doesn't sound like a mindless NPC, I don't know what does, folks.  Can you imagine not being able to see images in your head?  And why does it seem like all these Redditors can't see pictures?  I mean, I don't have the best imagination, but I can definitely visualize an apple in my mind's eye.  It's red.  I took a bite out of it.  I can taste the apple.  Now for those of you who aren't exactly familiar with the NPC meme, what is it?  Well, an NPC is a non-playable character.  They're basically background characters in video games that, well, they're just scripts did.  They're robots, they're drones, they're not actually people.  They are the illusion of life.  And the NPC meme was created to make fun of the majority of normies out there who are just not very self-aware or aware of the world around them.  Kind of like an NPC.  So here, Adam says, reminds me of this post on Reddit that I found a while back, where this guy apparently just never knew that he could think in language.  I mean, come on now, just WTF, man.  You know, actually, the brain doesn't actually need language to process information, and it's probably faster.  Like, you're faster at thinking with pure thought than you are to think with words.  But let's just take a look here.  I never thought with language until now.  This is my story.  I think I'm very different from most people because of one main thing.  I never thought with language, ever.  I moved to Canada when I was two from Asia, and I've basically been around English speakers my whole life.  I'm in my 20s now, and I can speak it relatively well, and I can understand every single word.  However, growing up, I never thought with language.  Not once did I ever think in my own mind with words like, what are my friends doing right now?  To planning things like, I'm going to do my homework right after watching this show.  I went through elementary school like this.  I went through high school like this.  I went through university like this.  And I couldn't help but feel something was off about me that I couldn't just put my hand on.  Just last year, I had a straight up revelation, epiphany.  And this is so hard to explain.  But the best way that I can put it is that I figured out that I should be thinking in language.  So all of a sudden, I made a conscious effort to try to think things through with language.  I spent years refining this new schema.  And it has completely and utterly changed my perception, my mental capabilities, and to be frank, my life.  I can suddenly describe my emotions, which was so insanely confusing to me before.  I understand concept that my friends are still existing, even if they're not in sight by thinking about their names.  I now suddenly have opinions and feelings on things that I never had before.  What the heck happened to me?  You woke up from the Matrix, my friend.  I started thinking in language after not doing so my whole life.  It's weird because I can look back at my life before and see how weird it was.  Since I now have this new skill, I can only describe my past life as mindless, empty, soulless.  As weird as it sounds, I'm not sure what I was, if I was even human, because I was barely even conscious.  It felt like I was reacting to the immediate environment and wasn't able to think outside of it.  It's such a strange time in my life.  It feels like I just found out the ultimate secret or something.  Can anyone relate or understand what I'm saying?  Can anyone explain what is happening to me?  I have no idea where to even post this, but this has been on my mind ever since I've been able to think about it.  So, this post is probably the single greatest piece of evidence that NPCs actually live among us.  People who can't even think.  People who can't even see images in their head.  Honestly, kind of like animals.  That's an insult to animals.  When I look at my cat, I know her emotions, I know what she's feeling, I know that there's thinking that goes on in there.  It's probably not the way we conceive of it, but there's an intelligence there.  So how can supposedly the most intelligent creature on Earth, the human being, not be able to think?  not be able to visualize.  My mind runs a thousand miles a minute.  I run layers of talking.  Here Anand says, Redditors are confirmed NPCs.  Welcome to 2011.  Enjoy your stay.  Here Anand says, These are the people that think Trump is going down any day now because he's Putin's bitch and socialism is actually pretty cool.  Here Anand says, Stop dehumanizing us.  Great lives matter.  So here Anand says, I had the opposite idea.  I just assumed that everyone had an inner monologue and could see things in their head.  The NPC meme is not just a meme, guys.  Here Anand says, Wow, it's almost like the entire internet.  And then IRL slash AFK.  Culture slash discourse after feels the ripple effect of whatever 4chan popularizes.  Inner dialogue.  Keck slash pep.  Trump 2016.  Soy, cuck, the list goes on.  Maybe it's time you all take seriously your obligations and influence as reality shapers and clean up your effing minds and lives.  so this doesn't turn to hell on earth.  Really makes you think.  Here, Anand says, this is how people used to dream in black and white when TV was in black and white.  Then people came to dream in color when color TV was widespread.  If you read, you get pictures in your head as you read.  This gives you the skill to visualize pictures in your mind.  People who don't read don't develop this.  Now, this is actually a really good point.  Some people are just weird.  My ex, one of my exes, she dreamt in black and white and in pictures.  Really interesting stuff.  My dreams are hyper-realistic.  fantasy worlds where the laws of physics don't apply.  Alternate histories and timelines and universes about.  It's like a cosmos of infinity.  I can't imagine dreaming in black and white, first of all, without color, and then two, I can't imagine just having pictures.  That sucks.  Here, Anand says, people always think they have this when they don't.  They think that some people can literally create films in their heads.  Yeah, seriously, um, that's a common skill.  I can make a film in my head if I want to.  So here Anon replies to that guy who said, uh, you know, films in their head.  Some people can, Anon, but it's completely unrelated to this.  I couldn't do that stupid Red Star bullshit that was in threads earlier, but whenever a project coming up, I'm literally doing it in my head dozens of times in real time vividly before I do it.  It's not a superpower.  It sucks because it makes it hard to relax sometimes or fall asleep.  Jeez, Anon, whenever something goes wrong, you seem to always know exactly what to do.  Yeah, bitch, because autistic OCD run all these effing mind's eye simulations and I've already dealt with this.  Here Anand says, I don't understand the absence of inner monologue.  Like when you read something, do you not sound the words out in your head?  I tried reading a book without mental verbalization and it's extremely difficult to do.  It's like a natural instinct.  You're telling me people actually live like that?  Here Anand has a spicy comment.  So here we have two comments.  You know, I was close to asking how the F did.  thinking, visualizing something was just a figure of speech when there are so many references to people doing that.  But then I realized the F-antasia itself explains it.  If you're not capable of doing it, being told to do it would just be an empty slogan.  Like, think outside the box or give 110%.  I'm like this.  I remember as a kid, I could conjure up fantastical and detailed pictures at will.  But as of today, I have to focus really hard to conjure up a muddled, unclear image.  When people describe something to me, especially directions, I have an incredibly difficult time visualizing.  Anonymous asks, do they dream?  How can you not have the ability to visualize things yet you dream?  Here, Anand says, we're playing the SimCity slash Doom crossover on nightmare mode.  Anand says, if you can literally see things in your mind, you're mentally ill.  Um, yeah, that's not how it works, buddy.  Anand says, even dogs dream.  I can't imagine them being dumber than dogs.  Here, Anand says, actually, a pretty good observation.  I think I heard something like that.  I'm not sure, but I think I remember that.  People literally don't process memories right anymore.  They get bombarded with so much shit, they don't actually know it's real.  The only things they have strong connections to are things they're fed continuously.  Here Anand says, Is this a genetic or mental illness or MK ultra societal programming?  WTF are we looking at here?  And here Anand has a very good reply.  could just be good old-fashioned greed.  Once people got the internet and smartphones, and every waking moment of their lives became a monetizable ad space, it changed the course of cognitive development.  Even back in the day, people thought radio or TV was too much because they saw changes in how younger generations acted.  Now it's infinitely worse.  Not only are people distracted, but the amount of info your brain is absorbing daily is far too much to process.  It's like the trope of a guy in the movie, being brainwashed with his eyelids taped open and images rapidly flashing in his eyes.  That's literally the world people are choosing to live in now.  Here Adam says, Well, slow down a second.  The whole NPC thing came about because of people who have no internal dialogue.  That's not the same as visualizing objects and images.  I myself can see a snapshot of an image in my mind if I try, but I can't really hold it.  That might be why I have no real artistic ability.  On the other hand, I have constant internal monologue.  And while I can't draw a machine to save my life, I have very high mechanical aptitude.  I am just saying, don't confuse another mental process with the original NPC observation.  The NPCs are quite literally on intellectual autopilot.  They latch on to any idea.  They are fed as long as it fits an emotional need.  They have no self-reflection.  Anonymous says, there are degrees to this ability.  I've talked about this to friends I consider intelligent, and they can vaguely form shapes in their mind, but can't manipulate a rotate shape.  Yeah, everyone has a different level, like visual acumen.  I myself, um, it's really weird because a lot of times when I try to visualize, it's just not that potent.  But at other times, it's like, it's so, it's like, it's so there.  It's, you can see it.  It's like right in front of you.  Not to mention, my dreams are hyper-realistic fantasy worlds.  Ha ha ha.  Further, um, proving that Reddit is full of NPCs, check this out.  Geginshine says, It's like hearing your voice in your head, but with pictures instead of sounds.  You aren't really seeing things with your eyes, just like you aren't hearing your own thoughts with your own ears.  MaoWing99 says, I don't even hear a voice in my head.  Here Anand says, Imagine what it's like to be an NPC, and then you find out that you're an NPC.  I wonder if they're capable of this.  I think that this meme is the perfect way to end this thread.  You are a non-playable character.  You do not have an inner monologue.  You do not have a soul.  You consume endless popular culture and are part of the mainstream collective.  You need someone to tell you what to think about issues in the public consciousness.  You are incapable of complex thought or forming your own opinions.  When confronted with something that conflicts your programming, You are incapable of thinking about it rationally and will result to emotions or shut down the attempt at thought.  NPC.  Live among us.  That's merely the obvious.  What do you think about this little revelation?  That there's people out there who literally don't know how to think and don't know how to visualize.  Be sure to let me know.  I'm really open to theories on this subject, and I find it fascinating as someone who studies people as a hobby.
