            "text": "What's going on, everybody?  Welcome back to another video.  Today, I want to talk about and compare 1-ounce silver bars to 10-ounce silver bars, but really quick, just in case you're new, make sure to subscribe for daily videos.  Also, make sure to subscribe to my second channel, which is my backup channel for exclusive silver content.  Link in the description.

Whoever minted this versus whoever minted this, that's not what I'm talking about.  I'm not comparing mints.  I'm comparing the denominations.  The 1 ounce to the 10 ounce.  And the reason I wanted to do this is because I don't stack a whole lot of these.  And to be honest with you, I don't even really stack a whole lot of these.  However, I stack way more of these than these.  So when it comes to 1 ounces and 10 ounces... I guess at the end of the day, it's all personal preference, so I just want to share a couple opinions with you and also share a couple of facts with you.  I personally do not stack many one-ounce silver bars because if I'm going to stack silver in one-ounce increments, it is 100%.  going to be a coin, something that is government-minted, something that is government-backed, something with face value, something with a high level of notoriety, something that everyone from everywhere, or at least most people from most places, would be able to recognize and trust.  So this, as opposed to a one-ounce coin... What's the difference, really, like a dollar, a dollar fifty when it comes to the premium?  I would rather convert a slightly higher dollar amount into a coin, a pure silver coin, than a pure silver bar, a basic generic secondary market piece of silver.  But when it comes to larger denominations of silver, I go with a bar.  I have some 5 ouncers, I have some 10 ouncers.  This thick piece of metal, this heavy piece of metal, it's actually pretty cool.  I didn't really fully understand until I got it for the first time and held it for the first time.  It really feels like you're holding on to something substantial.  It really feels significant.  It really gives you a sense of what holding on to real money feels like.  you underestimate how heavy it is.  I guess you could say the same about a one ounce bar, but once you hold onto a five and a 10, the one ounce doesn't feel very heavy anymore.  But anyway, if I'm gonna stack something larger than a one ounce piece of silver, it's going to be a five or a 10 ounce bar.  Now the difference between a one ounce bar and a five or a 10 ounce bar, other than the weight of the silver, other than the size of the piece of silver.  we're gonna talk about the premiums really quick because we got a one ounce here.  we got a 10 ounce here similar to buying something at Walmart or Target compared to buying something the same thing at Costco or Sam's Club or whatever.  it's usually a little bit cheaper to go this route as opposed to getting 10 of these.  Because this right here, with the current spot price plus the premium, I can get one of these for about $170.  Not a whole lot of money.  But when it comes to these, due to the spot price and due to the premium, multiplied by 10, this would cost me closer to $178 to maybe $180, maybe even a dollar or two more than that.  Point being is 10 of these... is the same exact identical weight to one of these, but because of the spot price and the premium, this ends up being a little teeny tiny bit cheaper, not by very much, maybe $5 or so.  In the grand scheme of things, $5, $10 isn't a massive, major difference.  But at the end of the day, if you're stacking on a weekly basis or a monthly basis, those $5, $10 begins to add up.  So, in my personal opinion, nothing I say in my videos is advice, by the way.  I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I a precious metal expert, professional, or specialist, nor am I a psychic.  I can't tell you what's going to be better in the future, whether it be tomorrow, next week, or 15 years from now.  I can't do that.  I don't know.  Nobody knows.  It's all speculation.  I just wanted to make a video sharing with you what I do and talk about what I think.  So personally, the reason I got this was because I had leftover eBay bucks or that eBay bucks certificate or whatever, so I ended up getting this for pretty much nothing because it was basically a gift card in a way.  This, I converted my own dollars into, and I don't stack a whole lot of these just because it's a big chunk of silver.  In a way, I mean, obviously, we got 25-ouncers out there.  We got kilo bars.  We got, you know, much larger denomination pieces of silver.  But this is obviously, you know, like I said before, dollar amount, about $170.  So I would normally rather take my 170 bucks and convert it into one ounce coins, but every once in a while, I like to mix it up a little bit.  Every once in a while, I like to, you know, switch things up, diversify a little bit.  At the end of the day, I'd rather have coins than bars, but sometimes I like to get a larger denomination piece of silver.  I have five ouncers as well.  But one of the things that I wanted to point out is the fact that if and when silver were to ever completely skyrocket, you know, if silver were to quadruple in value, like I said, this is worth 170 bucks right now.  If it were to quadruple in value, this might be a little bit tougher to sell off for cash.  Where these, on the other hand, one-ounce increments would probably be a little bit easier.  I mean, of course, you could always melt it down and divide it up, but I wouldn't really want to do that, considering it has a recognizable mint.  Sunshine mint.  Almost everyone knows what a sunshine mint bar is, so... Larger denominations and smaller denominations, they both have their pros and their cons.  I want you guys to let me know in the comments which do you prefer or which would you prefer.  Mint aside, it doesn't matter if it's an RCM bar, I don't care if it's a Silvertown bar, I don't care if it's a Sunshine bar, I don't care if it's a piece of silver that you melted down and poured your own bar out of it.  Would you rather have one ounce silver bars or 10 ounce silver bars?  Would you rather have 10 of these or one of these?  Let me know in the comment section down below.

I know many of us prefer coins but let's talk about bars in the comments section of today's video.  I wanna know your preference.  Do you prefer getting smaller denominations of silver, or would you rather get a larger denomination of silver?  Maybe a 10-ounce bar, or maybe a 25-ounce bar, a kilo bar, something even bigger than that.  Do you prefer larger denominations or smaller denominations?  And let me know in the comment section why.  Please weigh out the pros and the cons.  Like I said before, these cost a little bit more.  The premium's a little bit higher if you were to get 10 of these as opposed to one of these, but... At the same time, if the spot price were to ever, you know, multiply by 10, let's just say, this might be a little bit harder to sell off than 10 of these.  You could sell one to one person, one to another, three to another, one to another.  You guys get the picture.  Let me know in the comment section down below anything and everything related to silver bars.  Thank you guys so much for watching.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And remember, don't you dare stop smiling.  Peace. ",
