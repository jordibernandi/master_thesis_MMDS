            "text": "J.K.  Rowling, who you may know as the author of that theory that wizards don't need indoor plumbing because they can just shit on the floor and then magic it away, J.K.  Rowling has finally officially come out as a TERF, a.k.a.  a trans-exclusionary radical feminist, which is literally just an accurate description of what a TERF believes, but apparently they think TERF is a slur, so for this video I'm going to use a less loaded term.  Bigoted fuckface.  This all started because of a woman named Maya Forstater, a tax expert who worked for a London-based think tank called the Center for Global Development, CGD.  Forstater is a TERF.  Excuse me, a bigoted fuckface.  You know what?  I'm just going to go with TERF.  It's easier to say.  Really rolls off the tongue.  Forstater publicly tweeted her brilliant ideas like male people are not women, which led CGD to not renew her contract for 2020 because she was openly discriminatory towards trans women.  She took her case to court, hoping that it would set a precedent that would allow her specific belief system that trans women are actually men to be considered protected speech instead of hateful discrimination.  She just lost that case, leading other bigoted fuckfaces like Rowling to offer their support for her.  The strange thing is that TERFs present their argument as one that is both scientific and feminist, so you would think that I would be all about that.  I love science.  I love feminism.  But it turns out it's neither.  People like Rowling and Forstater fervently believe that the science is on their side, in the same way that many pseudoscientists do, when in fact they're just blissfully ignorant of the science of sex and gender.  Saying XX equals woman and XY equals man and you can't change.  that has as much scientific basis behind it as saying, if we evolved from monkeys, then why are there still monkeys?  Both are statements that might sound reasonable to a not particularly bright middle schooler, I guess, but that doesn't make them correct.  And both statements present similar problems when actual scientists attempt to explain the actual science to the people who are saying those things.  The fervent believers are just going to throw their hands in the air because it doesn't really matter what the real science says.  They're going to say that that's too complicated or the data is lying or whatever other excuse they can think of.  And they're going to continue believing what they believe because they don't believe what they believe based on what the science says.  They came to their belief first for other reasons and then attempted to build up science and reason in a way that makes it look like it supports their belief.  If you're curious, I highly recommend this Scientific American article by NYU neuroscientist Simone N. Sun.  that breaks down the science of sex into relatively simple terms for a complicated subject.  For instance, the Y chromosome doesn't just magically make a male.  Instead, a number of different genes need to work in concert at exactly the right time in exactly the right way to make the gonads that we associate with males.  And then other genes, along with hormones and environmental cues, can later develop penises or vaginas or a lot of body hair or facial hair or boobies, what have you.  What those chromosomes and hormones and other things do fall in line with what we think of as male or female and man or woman.  often enough for us to have averages and to have a pretty good idea of what sex and gender most people are.  But that shorthand, while it might be convenient for day-to-day life or for teaching middle schoolers what chromosomes are, it's simply not enough to account for the diverse array of beautiful human bodies that we find in the world.  And it's anti-scientific to pretend as though it is.  It's anti-scientific and, I should add, boring as fuck.  Like, it reminds me of the God of the gaps, the idea that throughout human history, whenever we ran into something that we didn't understand, we would just say, well, that's what God is.  God's the thing that's making the earth spin or making rainbows appear or spreading diseases.  The real cause of those things is more complicated than God does it, but it's worth knowing for the advancement of the human race and for your personal enjoyment and your personal advancement as a human.  It's boring to just stop at what you don't know.  And TERFs employ a god of the gender gaps.  Oh, sure, there are all these people who don't fit into the neat boxes I learned about in middle school, but let's just pretend that those are random mistakes and these other people are just crazy.  That way I can keep my safe, simple understanding intact without needing to learn new things.  Getting back to Forstater, is it right that she be fired or her contract not be renewed for her anti-scientific beliefs?  Not if they were just any anti-scientific beliefs, in my opinion.  For instance, I don't think that a receptionist should be fired for believing that evolution is a lie.  That's also an anti-scientific belief.  But even though it's wrong, and on a large scale, I do think it's dangerous for society, I think people deserve a general freedom of belief.  In general, people should be allowed to hold wrong beliefs without punishment on the part of society.  But what if that receptionist's anti-scientific belief is that women are intellectually inferior and should be subservient to men?  And then what if that receptionist is a man?  and what if he speaks to all women as though they're children?  In that case, that's an issue.  In all other ways, he might do his job fine, but every woman he interacts with is made to feel like less of a human being because of his belief.  Forstater says that her belief system should be tolerated at work just like any other belief system, but her beliefs quite literally dehumanize trans people.  Research shows that misgendering trans people, calling them by the wrong name, for instance, leads to an increase in depression and suicide.  No one can ever force Forstater to understand the science here, or even to understand why kindness is important, but if she wants to participate in society, all she needs to do is not go out of her way to misgender the people around her and make them feel less than human.  And I really don't think that that's asking too much.  And yeah, fuck JK Rowling.  This one is easy for me because I didn't grow up reading Harry Potter.  I just never got into it.  And I noticed Rowling sinking into turfdom ages ago.  But I can sympathize with those of you who are having a lot of trouble with this.  Hell, I can even empathize a bit as someone who is a fan of Father Ted and the IT crowd and black books, seeing as Graham Linehan has gone down the same path as Rowling.  But I can only imagine how it must be for those of you who were kids, who grew up seeing yourself in the story, Rowling's story, of a child who discovered that who he is on the inside is more important than the cards that life dealt him.  I can see how a lot of people and a lot of trans people, a lot of LGBT people in general, found a lot of comfort in those stories.  It's important that you remember that what you took out of those books and films is separate from what Rowling put into them.  Look up death of the author.  This is a perfect case for it.  Your interpretation of those books is the right one.  You helped to build that story that you found so much comfort in.  And so if you've already bought those books and movies, feel free to go back to them and enjoy them for the same reasons that you've been enjoying them up until now.  But also please remember that the author is in fact still alive and makes money off of these things.  So please don't spend any more money on Harry Potter.  Stop giving money to bigoted fuck faces in general.  May I recommend that you graduate to authors with a more scientific understanding of sex and gender.  And if I may be so bold, they're also just better storytellers like Ursula K. Le Guin, Left Hand of Darkness.  Amazing.  Or N.K.  Jemisin, I just finished the fifth season and it's fucking awesome.  So there's so many better authors out there.  Definitely mourn someone that you thought was on your side, but it's okay to move past them and find new people to look up to and whose works you can enjoy. ",
