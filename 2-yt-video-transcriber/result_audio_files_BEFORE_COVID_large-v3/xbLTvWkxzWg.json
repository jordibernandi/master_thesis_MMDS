            "text": "Okay, Iran is ancient Persian.  In fact, until 1935, the name of the country, Greg, was Persia.  It's changed to Iran.  And they have a whole history, of course, the Persian Empire and the Old Testament.  Remember, you've got the Medes and the Persians after the Babylonians defeated them.  Iran has had a really fascinating history.  But what's amazing, Greg, In Ezekiel chapter 38, it talks about a coalition in the last days.  Persia is mentioned, and along with another character, Rosh, which seems to be a proper noun referring to the present country of Russia, and having a military alliance.  Never in the history of the human race has there been a military alliance between those two geographical entities, there which is modern-day Iran and modern-day Russia, until now.  And we have now military, you know, pacts being signed between the two nations.  And so the scenario that the Bible predicted, seemingly so impossible, is now falling into place.  And Iran and Russia are two of the very, very big players.  Now, Iran, like we mentioned before, Shia Muslims, only 10% of the Islamic world.  But they have a view of the last days, a prophetic view, that a final Imam or Mahdi will come, who is basically, you know, the 12th one. ",

And that's what they believe is going to happen in the last days.  Now, the Sunni Muslims, the 90% of them, have a different view of the last days.  And each other, they've been killing each other since the 7th century.  And so Iran, though, they believe, and here's the scary thing, Greg, they believe they're divinely ordained to do this.  That's why they're enriching uranium, working on the bomb.  And I don't know if you saw it a couple weeks ago.  They had a rocket there that was shown, a picture of it, about 90 feet high.  That would be an intercontinental ballistic missile.  That's not just to hit Israel.  That's to hit us because we're the big Satan.  Israel's the little Satan.  So we're in their crosshairs. ",

And we read about that in Ezekiel.  And their attack, of course, against Israel.  It has to be regathered again and placed back in their land, which Israel is.  So now pulling the camera back, big picture, prophetically, Where does this align with, say, emergence of the Antichrist, tribulation period, and rapture? ",

We came up with 12 different views with the timing of it, so it's not that clear.  But it seems the church is out of here because at the end of Ezekiel 39, the eyes of Israel are open to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  So it seems we're out of here when that takes place.
