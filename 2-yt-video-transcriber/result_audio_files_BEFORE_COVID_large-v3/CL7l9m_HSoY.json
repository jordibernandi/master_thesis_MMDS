            "text": "Well, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Brown.  If you're watching the Epic House, an amazing episode of the Unboxing Authority.  On this episode, we have Aerialer Shiatsu Foot Massager with Rolling Massager and Air Compression, okay?  This thing looks pretty massive.  It's model RD-Z677, okay?  And it looks pretty massive here.  It looks like it's probably going to fit my feet.  We'll see.  Because I've got some pretty big feet.  Some companies don't make shoes in my size.  Ah!  Oh man, so with normal foot massagers, you know, the cheap ones and stuff, basically what you're doing is you're putting your feet on something that's moving around.  This thing is gonna swallow your feet down into it, down inside it, okay?  And it's gonna swallow your feet and it's gonna massage them and do amazing, great things.  It's gonna make your feet great again, right?  Now this, I do not know if my feet are gonna fit in it.  I'm checking it out right now.  My feet might be too big.  I might have to stick my grandma's feet in here and see what'll happen.  We'll see.  I'm not quite sure yet.  Oh man.  And it's supposed to do compression around your foot while swallowing it up.  So this could be kind of interesting.  It's big.  It looks like these things you stick your feet in, they actually unzip and come out of here.  I'm gonna show it to you.  So they unzip and come out so you can wash them.  Oh, the cord winds up on the back.  That's pretty sweet.  So it's 110 volt, uses 40 watts it says, and runs 60 hertz shiatsu foot massager.  And then, it's got some screws in the bottom, some compartments, not sure what's in those, but look at this.  The cable winds up on the bottom, so you don't have a messy cord.  Notice how it's like it's cordless, like there's no cord on it, but it's hidden underneath, that's pretty cool.  Okay, so I'm looking at this here, we got an on-off, heat mode and we got strength like how strong it's going to be.  there's a remote control.  it's got uh pressure and then time.  so all things that you need to control your amazing foot massager right there all right.  so here i am with the foot massager.  i was a little concerned at first that my feet were going to fit but they do actually manage to fit if i do it just right.  so i gotta get my foot down in there.  I haven't turned it on yet with my feet in there, so I'm a little bit not sure if this is going to hurt my feet or tighten down on them or what it's going to do, but I did manage to get them in there.  Oh yeah.  And if this works, okay, so there it goes.  It's on.  Go ahead and hit.  Oh, it's going all on its own.  Ooh, that feels pretty good.  It's almost like it's tickling the bottom of my feet, though, because my feet are a little bit ticklish.  Change to mode two.  Oh, now it feels like somebody's going from front to back on my foot, like they're squeezing it from front to back.  Okay, so level four is as high as the strength level goes, and I think it's high enough.  It seems like safe, and it's high enough.  Let's go to a different mode, I guess.  Program three.  I really like the way it grabs around my feet.  The pressure on them and stuff, that just feels... Really good.  In mode 3, it's just squishing and squishing and squishing, getting tighter and tighter and tighter.  Going front to back again.  Let me try mode 4 here.  It says I've been doing this for 5 minutes now, I think.  So mode 4, what it's doing right now is it's just squeezing and letting off, squeezing and letting off around my whole foot, which is kind of like someone just like this around your foot.  Oh my goodness, I just went to mode 5.  It's like my feet are in a washing machine.  They're just going all over the place in there, the rollers, the massagers.  It's still from front to back, but it's just very different.  And back to program one again.  So it's got five programs.  They all feel good.  Oh, yeah.  Back in program one, and it is rubbing my feet for a while, then it squeezes, squeezes harder.  That just feels so good.  Let's go ahead and see how strong it can go.  So apparently when you hit pressure, all it does is squeeze.  I don't have access to the modes, I don't have access to strength, it's just pressure.  So I'm turning the pressure back off, going back to mode one, and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna turn up the strength, all the way.  oh it's it's you hear the machine.  it's kind of like it's trying really hard.  it really is squeezing my feet really hard and it's really working those fingers it has under my feet.  that is an amazing feeling.  i don't think i've ever had anything that was able to squeeze my feet that hard.  that's really good.  on all the way around.  that feels really good.  oh man That is doing such a good job.  I got the strength turned up all the way on this thing.  What it does is it's got air in there and it grabs around your feet.  It just grabs your whole foot like this and then it's got these massagers underneath and they just go up under your foot like this, back and forth fingers massaging your feet.  It's amazing.  I don't know if you'd enjoy it.  I don't know if it's too strong for you, but it feels great.  It just feels so good.  I don't even want to stop.  I've been sitting here for probably over 20 minutes now because I keep resetting the timer on it when it gets down.  And I don't want to pull my feet out of this thing.  It just feels really good.  I don't think I've ever had a foot massage like this in my life.  Well, now I don't have to hire any royal subjects to come rub my feet anymore because I've got this thing, and this is just amazing.

First thing you need to know before you get into law is there's a resource out there you need to get.  So you have to know the basics of what they do and how they do it, the lawsuit way.  To learn that, there's a link in the description of most of my videos that says how to win in court.  And you might see a thing up in the corner of the video that you're watching over there, a card or something.  And basically what it is is it's a thing you pay, I think, $250 for, I think, a year of access to it.  You can go through the course in, I'd say, about a week.  They probably say you can go through it faster than that.  And you want to write down everything you learn.  and they've got a lot of copyright stuff, so they don't want you copying the videos or anything.  So I can't say to do that.  But basically, you want to get through the program and get to the end, and then if you paid for it and everything and registered it in your name, they give you a fancy certificate or something.  at the end, I guess, that shows you completed the school and passed their tests.  But learning that, learning the basics of that, fills in all the gaps and gives you a good starting point before you learn law.  Thank you.  Well, thanks for watching the video.
