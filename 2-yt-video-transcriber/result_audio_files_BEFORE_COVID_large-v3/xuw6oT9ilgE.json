The role of the United States is not to handpick the next leader of Venezuela.  Mr.  Abrams, I have a question for you.  My question is whether you're aware of any transfers of weapons or defense equipment by the United States government to groups in Venezuela opposed to Nicolas Maduro since you were appointed special representative for Venezuela.

The reason that I disagree with the statement and the approach is because I believe that it gives license to countries like China and Russia to then further engage with Venezuela and do it in the name of protecting Venezuela's sovereignty by drumming up the idea that the United States is going to invade the nation of Venezuela.

The United States must show leadership in our own hemisphere, and we must continue to provide aid to suffering Venezuelans.  But I want to just build on Mr.  Keating's question, because you said of the 51 countries in this coalition, we are the only one that has threatened the use of military force.  And in response to a question from Mr.  Keating, you said, because we're the only one capable of doing it.  Surely you're not suggesting the other 50 countries do not have military capability to engage in a military action if they so elected, do you? ",

What is particularly concerning to me is that in light of the fact there is no legal authority to express the use of military force as an option, it's unclear to me how the president or anyone in the administration can claim it's an option on the table because it is not.  And to the extent that we are suggesting that it is, we are misleading the international community, we're misleading the people in Venezuela.  So I urge you to take back the message to the administration that it is not authorized and not helpful.  And I'd now like to turn to Mr.  Olive to talk. ",
