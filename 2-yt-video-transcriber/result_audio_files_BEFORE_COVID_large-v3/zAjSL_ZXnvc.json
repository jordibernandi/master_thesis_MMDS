            "text": "What's up, everybody?  Today, I'm going to be giving my analysis of the Architects and Engineers Report on World Trade Center 7, which they had released on September 3rd.  Here's my general breakdown of what it's saying.  Now, first off, they go over the original NIST findings from the official investigation.  That report cites fire as being the cause of said collapse.  It was stated that the fire heated up the beams on the northeast corner of the 13th floor.  Now, here are the structure rules for the 13th floor, and they're talking about this corner up here.  Now you'll see your north arrow in the upper left hand corner.  That means that we're looking north, which is pretty much default view.  Like if there was no north arrow and I was ever in a pinch and forced to assume what direction these drawings were in, I would always assume north.  This is the typical way blueprints are oriented.  So if we zoom in on this corner here, this is when this happens.  That heat from said fire caused G3005, K3004, and D3004 to buckle from the heat, which then pushed girder A2001 six and a quarter inches to the west which made it go off his seat, detach from column 79, causing that section to crash into the 12th floor, along with knocking column 79 out.  So with this, NIST says that this caused an eight-story collapse, which then triggered the entire building to begin to follow suit.  This is their computer-generated model of the collapse.  All right, so here's the problems with this official report.  First, they assume the system to be rigid with no sway or give, which is not true of these buildings.  Even when we're building them and putting them up, the crane is sometimes pulling these sections inches in each direction, depending on which way the counterweight is facing or how big a load that they're lifting and whatnot.  But these buildings are purposely designed to endure this.  You have to think with a skyscraper, you're going to need movement and a bit of flexibility because once the windows are in, you're gonna have wind loads bearing down on these.  So it's in the design.  Many skyscrapers even have what's called a mass damper at the very top to counteract this sway.  Next, NIST never included the side connector beams S3007, G3007, and K3007 in their model.  Now it shows them at some points in their report, but is not added into their simulation.  And in their simulation, they showed G3005 buckling, which could not have happened with those beams in place.  So that leaves K3004 and D3004 buckling, which also were inaccurately inputted because they had left out the beam stiffeners, which these are the beam stiffeners right here, the webs like this, and they're inserted to prevent exactly that.  And in this section, it shows that a 2001 had them halfway up, not included in the NIST model.  And that's not to mention that there was a floor welded onto all of these beams, which was holding them together, preventing buckling as well.  You can also see here that they use Q decking, which is a metal deck that is then filled with mesh and concrete as such to create a solid floor.  Now, another thing that you can see on this section that's shown the Q deck and is that it also shows fireproofing unless otherwise noted.  That's a foam that they spray on to coat these beams once they're in to protect them from being affected if there's a fire on one of the floors.  I mean, regular office fires do happen, which let's be honest, how big was this fire in the first place?  It burned all day, barely spread, and you could barely even see it.  Now let's compare that to the fire of the London Tower.  This is a fire that all the fireproofing in the world would not matter.  This is where you could blame fire for displacing and buckling beams.  But this?  This is exactly why they coat these beams so the structure stays uninfected until someone can put it out.  Now it's also of note that this building did not collapse.  It burned completely out to its frame and never collapsed.  But this building, where the fire is a fraction of the size, built in downtown Manhattan with the best construction and highest building standards in the world, collapses in under nine hours.  In fact, it's the only steel building to ever collapse from a fire in history.  Now next, we have probably the most crucial piece of info left out by the NIST report being the column side plates.  Now most of the columns on this building, as you can see, did not have side plates because they have I-beams connecting to them from all sides.  But column 79, the column in question, does not.  And as you can see in this section, had two 16-inch wide plates on either side, which created a one-inch lip on either side of the 14-inch column.  rendering it impossible for girder a 2001 to move six and a quarter inches to the east and off its seat because it would have hit the lip of the plate and get trapped there now going through this old news footage of the construction of world trade center 7 from 1986 at towards the end.  here i was able to determine that these side plates were in fact installed.  now if i stop it by the end here By looking at the prints and using the old buildings to orientate myself, you can see the North Tower here, World Trade Center 6, and Verizon here to the west.  I can determine that this is column 76 making this column 79.  Now the orientation of the queue decking also confirms this.  as you can see it's running east to west coming up to column 79 and then shifting north to south on the east side of column 79 exactly where the structure will show the orientation of the I-beam shifting.  Now this picture is looking south so that would make this girder A2001 and as you see here column 79 very clearly has steel plates protruding one inch north which would prevent A2001 from sliding off its seat disconnecting it from column 79 and subsequently collapsing that corner of the floor.  Now forgetting all that, take away the connector beams prohibiting G3005 from buckling and pushing A2001.  Forget the beam siphoners.  Forget that there was a deck connected to it, further diminishing their chance of moving.  Forget the fireproofing that coated these beams in the first place.  Forget the steel plates that would have prevented it from moving more than two inches max, even if those other things were able to happen.  Even if all that weren't there and the floor did collapse the way NIST claimed it did, this report also determined that it would have only generated about a third of the impact that that floor was designed to absorb anyway so it would have simply just fell into the 12th floor and be contained there and stopped.  it would take 632,000 pounds of force to collapse the 12th floor and it only calculates to 215,211 pounds of force.  furthermore q decking is just as powerful as a reinforced concrete slab but it has a steel under it and a steel decking under it so which makes it far lighter with less impact.  it says that they use a 3500 concrete mix for this building which is average.  basically how it works is the higher the number the stronger the mix.  for instance most columns and walls in a reinforced concrete building be 10,000 mix because they're vertical and you want them to be as strong as part of your building.  most floors since they don't have metal decking underneath will use anywhere from a 4,000 to a 6,000 on average and slabs will be typically six to eight inches.  this slab was five and a half inches at this part and two inches at this part.  this makes for a much lighter slab and would be much less of an impact on the floors below.  so basically When inputting all the correct information, the initial eight-story collapse NIST claims that caused the entire collapse could never, ever have happened.  But in this report, they ran the simulation anyway.  And when you do that, it shows that when the NIST model is run and those floors collapse the way they say they did, even though we know that could never happen.  the building tips over which is not what was observed in the video.  so that's that.  but then they just kept running it anyway keep going up eight stories.  so what if these eight stories collapse first 13 to 21 it still tilts seven and three sixteenths inches.  21 to 29 tilts five and three eighths inches.  29 to 31 tilts tilts three and three quarters inches.  they had to run this model all the way up to floors 37 to 45 before the tilting was negligible and went down straight in the building which could have never happened.  the highest floor where the collapse could have initiated was floor 16 being that in that video we can observe floor 17 to 47 falling together as a unit.  so across the board the official report of what caused world trade center 7 to fail is completely inaccurate and an impossibility.  So what caused the collapse?  Several models and scenarios were then ran as a team observed and analyzed how the simulations reacted until they found what matched the videos of the collapse to a tee.  What they found was that the only way Building 7 could have collapsed the way it did was if every core column simultaneously failed over 8 stories, followed by all the exterior columns simultaneously failing 1.3 seconds later.  We also know from the video, like I just said, that this had to occur below the 17th floor.  now that we have this information on how the collapse took place let's look at how a controlled demolition works.  first off most of the dynamite is typically loaded on those lower levels especially the first floor.  that's where the greatest amount of drops happen.  okay check we know the collapse started on the lower floors.  it continues below that during the implosion dynamite is detonated at split second intervals set to a series of pre-programmed delays the.  Now we know that the only simulation that works is if all the core columns simultaneously fail and then a second later all the outer columns fail, which would be indicative of a pre-programmed delay.  Add that to this omission by building's owner Larry Silverstein that they gave the order to quote pull it and then watch the building collapse. ",

I guess, I don't know if he got an answer or not.  He came back over with his hand over the radio, and it sounded like a countdown.  And at the last few seconds, he took his hand off and you heard three, two, one, and he was just saying, just run for your life, just run for your life.  And then it was like another two, three seconds, you heard explosions.  Like, ba-boom!  It's like a distinct sound.  It's not like when the compression, like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, like floors that were dropping and collapsing.  This was ba-boom!

I got to go back to America.  I got to go get ready for the bomb.  What's wrong with me?  I'm ready for the bomb.  The information that the Central Intelligence Agency has obtained by questioning men like Khalaq Sheikh Mohammed, he told us the operatives have been instructed to ensure that the explosives went off at a point that was high enough to prevent people Trapped above from escape.  There were those two explosions.  I was at the base of one of those buildings and it literally shook.  Somebody grabbed my shoulder and I started running and the shit's hitting the ground behind me.  And the whole time you're hearing, thump, thump, thump, thump.  I think I know an explosion when I hear it.  That didn't sound like just a building falling down to me while I was running away from it.  There's a lot of eyewitness testimony down there hearing explosions.  All I can attest to is that by noon or 1 o'clock, they told us we had to move from that triage site up to Pace University, a little further away, because Building 7 was going to come down or being brought down.  the building actually because it was on fire, the bottom floors of the building were on fire.  And, you know, we heard this sound that sounded like a clatter of thunder turned around.  We were shocked to see that the building was, well, it looked like there was a shock wave ripping through the building and the windows all busted out and, you know, it was horrifying.  Then, you know, about a second later, the bottom floor caved out and the building followed after that.  It's amazing amazing incredible.  pick your word for the third time today.  it is reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.  And so therefore, this smoke that we were talking about, and keep in mind, there are firemen, policemen, other workers down there working, searching for people in the previously collapsed World Trade Center, two towers, fates unknown.
