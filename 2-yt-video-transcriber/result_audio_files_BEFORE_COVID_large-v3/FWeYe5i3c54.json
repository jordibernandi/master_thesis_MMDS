            "text": "So we just came out with a forecast of the primaries at 538, and we're pretty darn excited about it.  Our model literally simulates the entire process from Iowa in February to the Virgin Islands in June.  And the question is, can some candidate hit the magic number of 1,990 delegates?  Our forecast has Joe Biden as the most likely person to win the majority of delegates.  But let's break that down.  Say Biden wins Iowa, for example.  If he does, then he's off to the races.  Now, Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren might fight back in New Hampshire.  But even then, the race could start to look a lot like Hillary Clinton versus Bernie in 2016.  So our model says Biden has about an 80% chance at a delegate majority if he wins Iowa.  But Biden's polling in Iowa isn't that great.  He's basically in a four-way tie there, which means there are three other people who could win.  So what happens if Biden loses Iowa?  Well, then his chances fall all the way to 20%, our model says.  He could still fight back, maybe in more diverse states like Nevada and South Carolina.  But any Democrat who loses Iowa is facing a bit of an uphill battle.  So sorting through all these scenarios, our model gives Biden about a 40% chance of winning the majority of delegates.  So do I buy that Biden is a favorite?  Well, not quite.  To me, a favorite means over 50%, and Biden is winning less than half the time in our model.  So if he doesn't win, then who else might?  Our model says Bernie Sanders has the next best chance with around a 22% chance of a majority.  He has plenty of strength in Iowa and New Hampshire, and if he wins two or three early states, he'd be in the driver's seat for the nomination.  Warren comes next with a 12% chance of winning the majority.  Then there's Pete Buttigieg.  Our forecast says his chance is at about 10%.  But there's still one big if.  What if no one wins a majority, say, because the early states produced three or four different winners?  Well, that's a real possibility, too.  In fact, our model has about a 15% chance of there being no majority at all.  And if that's the case, we are potentially looking at a contested convention.  Sure, it sounds a little crazy.  But until people actually start voting, our advice is not to rule anything out. ",
