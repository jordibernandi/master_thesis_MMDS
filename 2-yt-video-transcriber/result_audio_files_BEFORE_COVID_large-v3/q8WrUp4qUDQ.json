            "text": "Cowards.  Hello.  Cowards.  Are you there, cowards?  Coward.  Coward.  Blue Isis terrorists.  Blue Isis terrorists, hello?  Are the terrorists home?  I'm speaking right into there as loud as I can.  Ringing a little bell.  Ding dong.  More like dum dum.  They think locked doors are going to keep me out.  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  are they fucking mistaken.  Today it might keep me out.  Today it might.  Today it might.  Later on in early next week, it won't.  Cowards!  Hello?  Cowards!  Cowards!  Cowards.  I hear you back there, cowards.  Look at them.  Look at them back there.  Fucking cowards.  Fucking cowards.  Unreal.  What a bunch of fucking cowards.  Hello, I'm ringing your bell.  Blue terrorist, blue line terrorist cowards.  Blue ISIS cowards, hello.  Hello, blue ISIS cowards.  Now their bell works.  Boy, lucky.  I got about three hours worth of tape and plenty of time.  Cowards.  Cowards.  Cowards.  I can see why Sergeant Joanne Pepitone is suing the crap out of these fucking scum motherfuckers.  Oh, good.  Good, good, good.  Sir?  Hey, how you doing?  Can I have Dan's badge number, please?  What's your name?  Can I have Dan's badge number, please?  Just to let you know, I don't know his badge number offhand.  You don't know your fellow officer.  Can you please go get it for me and not have me wait 45 minutes?  We're waiting for a supervisor to come in.  He's going to be in a couple minutes.  Who needs a supervisor?  You said you wanted to file a complaint.  No, I said I wanted complaint forms.  Tell Danny he's an idiot.  What's your name and badge number?  Sexton, what's your badge number?  38.  How come no one's answering this bell?  Because there's no one working today.  No one's working today.  I'm not talking about a dispatcher.  I'm talking about an officer.  I wanted to get a complaint form.  That's all I wanted.  Okay?  So now, he tells me they don't have them out in the public area.  You do have them out in the public area.  You need to tell that idiot what's going on here and stop being such a condescending coward.  Okay?  Who needs a supervisor?  No.  No.  Who said that?  Did Dan say that?  Is that what Dan said?  How would you know what I wanted when you and I never talked?  What can we help you with right now?  I needed a complaint form.  Now I need Dan's badge number.  Well, I'll have a supervisor come in.  No, I need you to let me know Dan's badge number.  Why you guys?  No wonder Joanne Pepitone's suing the crap out of you guys.  No wonder.  Look at the service I'm getting.  Look at the service I'm getting.  Horrible.  We'll be right with you.  I don't need anybody.  All right, have a seat.  No, I want Dan's number, jackass, you coward.  Hey, Blue Ice is coward.  Come here.  You fucking pussy.  You fucking pussy.  Good.  I'll wait for a supervisor.  You know what?  Tell the supervisor.  I'll be walking around the back lot taking the video back there.  He can find me.  I won't be far.  Motherfucker, motherfuckers.  All right.  They want to play?  I play.  Again, I don't start fights, I finish them.  No problem.  No problem.  All right, let's see.  Let's make sure there's no signs.  All right, because here's their back parking lot.  Public entrance that way, blah, blah, blah.  Donations.  So we've got private businesses there.  And let's see here.  Township employee vehicles only, open to public all other times with some policy.  Good for them.  Walk around and tag every single license plate there is here.  So this is open to the public.  Monday through Friday, open to the public all other times.  Boy, that's not too polluted, is it?  Now is it only that side, or is it both sides?  No signs, no signs, no signs.  Municipal parking, Lower Marion Township.  Oops.  Unreal.  You're gonna fucking blow me off like that?  Motherfuckers.  All right, so over here we got parking meters.  So this is all public parking on both sides.  You the supervisor?  Nah, just a coward, huh?  There we go.  I may have to pull a bow here.  I'm gonna do one of two things.  Run, as I'm saying, D as in civil.  What's up, buddy?  I'm doing well.  We'll see how these cops handle shit.  Oh, here they come now.  Point the camera at these little fucking cowards and all hell breaks loose, huh?  Went in there to get a complaint for them, and boy, they have a real hard time dealing with people.  They really do.  You guys still sending sexual stuff to Joanne?  You guys still sending sexual shit to Joanne?  You don't know what I'm talking about, huh?  Okay.  Well, then you must not work for the township, then.  Little buzzy bees are coming out now, little cowards.  Alright, there's no sign.  This is a public lot, I guess, the way it looks.  Absolutely a public lot.  Do you have your badge number, Dan?  How do you spell coward?  C-O-W-A.  What's your badge number?  Fucking dick.  No wonder why Joanne's suing the pants off you guys.  What's your badge number?  It's your policy to state when a citizen asks to identify yourself, identify yourself.  Why you got to make yourself look so bad on YouTube?  You're ruining your township.  Your whole bad attitude.  Are you the supervisor?  Can I get Dan's badge number, please?  No wonder why Joanne's suing you guys.  No wonder, no wonder.  Can you give me Dan's badge number?  No?  All a bunch of cowards?  What do you say, Dan?  Last chance to do what's right, buddy.  By the way, the complaint forms are in your lobby.  Okay?  So, this is my beat.  The station full's in my beat.  What's his badge number?  What do you want his badge number for?  Because he came in contact with me.  I'm going to ask for your badge number.  I'm 35.  Last name?  A-L-U-I-S-E.  Yeah, that's better.  I need your name, too.  No, you don't.  I'm not doing anything illegal.  This is not a stop in our new state.  You're videotaping private license plates?  I'm on public property.  Actually, this is private property.  Well, it's kind of... Private township property.  It is.  It is and it isn't.  There's no signs that say I can't be here.  Okay.  Number one.  You're videotaping personal vehicles that aren't yours.  I can videotape it from across the street over there.  Okay.  My name is D as in civil, A as in law, N as in suit.  Okay.  Is there anything else you need from me?  I'm asking if you give me your ID.  If you're asking, I just told you my name.  My name is Dan.  Your name is Dan.  What's your last name?  D as in civil.  A as in law.  What's your last name, Dan?  N as in suit.  I will not give that because I'm not under arrest.  Okay, guys.  Now, real quick.  I came in for a complaint form.  That's all I wanted.  Okay?  That's all I wanted.  And this guy has a bad attitude and let me stand here for over 20 minutes, okay, trying to wait for a complaint form.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'll let you talk in a minute.  What you're asking for is just to give me.  Well, then why are these in the lobby, then?  I just want a complaint form.  This is a complaint form in the lobby.  Then take it and go.  I did, but I wanted his badge number before I left.  Well, you have mine now.  Okay, what is his badge number, please?  I don't know.  Dan, what's your badge number?  You're making a township already badge.  You already got a black eye from the sexual harassment you're giving Joanne.  Can you please just give me your badge number?  75.  75.  Okay, I'll be back.  Monday's another holiday, I hear.  I'll be back Tuesday.  You were telling customers it was.  This guy needs to be informed a little bit better.  This is your beat.  You may want to educate him.  That's all I'm saying.  He's my senior officer.  You are in so much trouble.  You're a lot better trained than this guy.  Can I, uh... So, all right, guys, I'll be back.  You don't have to worry about who I am.  I will be back.  Okay?  I will be talking to your chief.  Why don't you want to give me your name?  Why do I have to?  You don't have to.  You give me your ID, I will give you my ID.  All right.  You give me your driver's license with all your information.  I'll give you my police ID.  No, I want your driver's license.  It's the same thing I would give you.  Same thing.  All right?  And then I'll have no problem with it.  All right?  You give me your ID, driver's license, I'll give you mine.  If not, just email me.  I don't have to give my personal address.  Nor do I. Nor do I. Okay.  So... So do me a favor.  I'm not here to fight.  I'm not here to cause trouble.  Okay.  I always document every move I make, just per se, just like you guys do.  Okay.  All right, Smirky?  Okay, Smirky?  You got a problem, man.  Yeah, I'm also free to stay.  Okay.  You guys don't know who you're messing with here.  I'm here properly doing legal activities.  If you guys want a lawsuit, besides when Joanne's giving you guys, no problem.  Have a great day.  I always do.  You better start treating your assistants a little bit better, Dan.  And you're giving my name... You should be called an asshole, not Dan.  Have a good day.  I always have a good day.  Keep on breaking everybody's civil rights, jackass.  I'll be back Tuesday.  Piece of shit motherfucker.  Piece of shit motherfuckers.  And real quick buddy, I'm not here to cause any trouble.  I'm here to document and shine the light of accountability on people.  And I appreciate that.  And I appreciate you not being a dick and forcing it.  Because you weren't allowed to.  It's all good.  All right.  Now they're going to follow me.  Good luck with that.  Actually, since they're Good Friday and they're closed, I guess what I'll do is I'll go to the township building and talk to the township manager on Tuesday.  See if she has any comments of this glossy... Now I see why.  They are a bunch of pricks.  They need a lot more fucking time than this.  I'm coming back regularly here. ",
