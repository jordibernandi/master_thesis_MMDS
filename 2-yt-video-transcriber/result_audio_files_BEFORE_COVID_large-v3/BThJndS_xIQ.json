And then you can engage with them to see, like if they say they think ghosts are real.  Yeah, yeah.  It could be like, well, what do you mean by ghosts?  Why do you think ghosts are real?  How did you determine that that reason justifies being so sure?  Yeah, yeah.  And I try to encourage the person to pick the topic.  So if you don't think ghosts are real, I'd rather not talk about it.  Right, right, right.
