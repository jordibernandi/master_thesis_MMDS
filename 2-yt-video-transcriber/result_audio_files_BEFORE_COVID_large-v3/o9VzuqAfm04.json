I'm going to work this thing.  Why didn't you tell me that when I stopped?  Because I was going to see what you do.  I ain't trying to.  You can't pull me over out here.  I can stop you and detain you.  What is wrong with you?  You can't.  You're swerving and trying to hit somebody.  I didn't try to hit somebody.  You got that big of a damn issue?  With what?  With everything, the world.  No, not at all.  You was one of the 80 men certified.  That don't make a ****, that shouldn't bother you.  But it's my kids on this world.  I don't care.  That's exactly right.  I don't care.  That's what's wrong with this world.  That's what's wrong with resources like you.  I was caught.  I got a high profile person.  Jim.  Jim.  Yeah, I got him at 70 out in the county, out of Norway, at 70 and a 55.  I pulled him over, and he's in the town cop car.  He has blue lights, and I still pulled him over.  He said he was chasing somebody with a gun.  So, before I wrote anything on this paper, I wanted to call you in.  Hold on a second.  Jim's getting out the call.  Hold on.  Hey, Jim.  Go sit back in the call.  I'll be with you in a minute.  What are you stopping me for?  I'm on the call.  Go back over there and sit in the call.  I'll be back with you in a minute.  All right.  All right.  All right.  He's making phone calls now.  I'll have to write you a speeding ticket tonight.  Oh, that was cold.  All right, that's done.  I got you sitting in the 55.  I have $185 on full points.  So the court date is going to be the 21st of February.  Show up then.  You show up then.  Don't finish talking.  Don't finish talking, Jen.  You show up then, and I can help you out with the time and the points, okay?  No, no.  Don't show up.  The supervisor's on with that.  Yeah, that's fine.  Who do you supervise?  David Burris.  Can you ask him to come up?  I'll give you his number if you want.  803-.  Oh, that's a good one.  Okay, if you need, just call Star XP and they'll get you.  No, I'm already doing that.  You can get in touch with Star XP.  All right, man.  Have a good one.  I'll be clearing tape.  I'll stop Jim Preacher.  Have a... On to G7 Abby, 10-8, 10-8-8.  G7, 8-9-4, 10-4.  R, you do it.

All right.  10-20, G-7-8.  Everyone likes the G. Can she use registration and insurance information?  Yes, she can.  Are you familiar with the police officer?  Last time I checked, no, I didn't have a call.  Sir?  Here.  You checked with Orangeburg?  Yeah, all right.  G-2-8, G-2-4, what you got on my hand, Bamberg?  Need registration.  Let me call you in a minute, man.  This is just crazy.  I want you to follow me.  If you need something, I'm right here in the office.  I want you to follow me to the station on 321.  I'm not.  I'm staying right here now.  All right.  Is the supervisor headed this way?  He's heading this way.  Good.  What's that?  Have you checked with the Sheriff's Department?  I'm keeping my shirt there.  Okay.  G-28, G-78, we're right here at 400 and St.  John's Avenue, right in the town limits.  We're here at 400 and St.  John's.  Affirmative.  Right here before you get to 321.  All right.  If y'all don't make out, that'll be a little more.  I'll be there in a second.  10-4, I haven't got out the car.  You just got my license and registration off.  10-12, you're off.  10-4.  Thank you.  Hey, bro.  What the hell is wrong with you?  You don't think I can stop you?  Watch this, man.  Hey.  You swung out there.  All that's on camera.  You swung out there trying to act like you tried to hit somebody.  What is wrong with you?  Isn't that sick of hurting?  Woo!  Hold on a minute.  Hey, brother.  Brother, if you don't get back, you're going to get busted.  You understand me?  Stop and do something.  All right.  Let me, uh... Listen, uh... I got a gun right there, just let you know, man.  Come back this way.  Come back this way, Shannon.  I'm gonna move up.  I'm gonna pass it down to my team.  Alright, I'm on my way to the city.  Why didn't you tell me that when I stopped you?  Because I was going to see what you do.  You can't pull me over out here.  I can stop you and detain you.  What is wrong with you?  You can't.  I did call him.  The reason why I'm here is because you're acting crazy.  If you're a damn police officer, why didn't you tell me?  You're right.  I shouldn't have to.  You're swerving and trying to hit somebody.  I didn't try to hit somebody.  I didn't try to hit somebody.  Brother, you got that big of a damn issue?  With what?  With everything!  The world!  No!  Not at all!  You was running an A.B.  in there four to five.  That don't make a f**king s**t!  That shouldn't bother you!  But it's- My kids own this world!  I don't care!  That's exactly right.  I don't care!  That's what's wrong with this world.  That's what's wrong with police officers like you.  You're right!  You are an idea, police officer!  You're f**king exactly right.  I hope you quit.  Um, that's not gonna happen.  Forty-five, seventy-five.  This one's where?  I didn't want to see you, I did, brother.  I just want to look out.  I want to ride along.  Hold on, no I ain't.  It's gonna be, uh, 10-12 Livingston.  10-4.  Yeah, buddy, you go ahead.  Go ahead.  Appreciate it.  Have a good day.  Buddy, I'll see you.  They got one hoping right there, possibly.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  Right then, King.  6124.  Okay.  Sorry, what did you say, Constable?  I said, are you going to get out and approach my car, or are we going to sit here all day?  Well, I'm trying to safely conduct my traffic stop, sir.  I'm going to run your plate, make sure your vehicle's not stolen.  Okay.  You know all the standard procedures, right, Constable?  No, I didn't know there was a standard, but I guess there is.  I'll try to keep myself safe, make sure that's not a stolen vehicle.  I just pulled over.  No, it's not a stolen vehicle.  I flashed my back strobes at you, which I'm sure you got on your video.  I'm trying to work.  I did not see those back strobes.  Okay.  What can I do for you?  What do you need from me?  I need your license, please, and proof of insurance.  You serious?  You just ran a red light right in front of me.  Okay, I didn't run a red light.  It's on camera.  Well, if I did, I certainly didn't mean to.  So what are you going to do?  You going to write me a ticket?  No, sir, I'm not.  Okay.  You know I've got a license.  You know that's a county vehicle because you've already run it.  It is a county vehicle?  That's a county ride, man.  Okay, let me do it.  I'll be right back with you.  I'm going to step back in my vehicle now.  Have a wonderful day, sir.  All right.  Where are you going so fast?  Huh?  Where are you going so fast?  Call a gang.  Huh?  Call a gang and claim it.  Look, this guy right here has been following you for miles, running over 100 miles an hour.  He's calling the state police.  I know you didn't call the damn state police.  No.  I didn't have your plate, so I didn't go over.  I was like, this guy's rolling.  He's running 112 right now.  I had you locked in 107.  It won't do 107.  It'll go 95.  I had to lock it.  Seriously, I had to lock it.  Because I was running 90, and I couldn't get it.  It was pulling away.  Dang.  I'm going to beat on the check.  It's going to go 95.  See you later.  What's up?  Yeah, man.  71 in the car.  What's up?  Clear Avenue at 18th Street.  Clear Avenue, 18th Street.  And the last five is going to be Adam, 8869, Ohio, Adam, 8869, 420 block.  Okay, all right.

Okay, I'll have you go ahead and retrieve your wallet for me.  Do you have your insurance information with you?  That's my business address.  I'm in North Richmond.  And you said you're on the job.  I work for the City of Lorain.  You said you're on the job, though.  Yes, sir.  What do you mean by you're on the job?  Well, what do you mean you're on the job?  Usually when you're on a job, it means you're working right now.  No, I'm not.  You're talking about a full-size red truck.  I'm on the job, sir.  You're driving around the area.  Yeah, I work for the City of Lorain.  All right.  I'm going to have you step out of the truck.  Please step out.  Okay.  All right.  Just have you head back to the back side of my car.  Over here.  Over here.  I'm going to ask if you have a seat in the rear of my car.  Okay.  I usually pat people down before I do that.  Is it okay if I pat you down?  Yes.  Just to advise you, I do have a firearm behind me.  Right.  I understand.  I'm going to retrieve that from you.  What I have you do is go ahead and put your hands on my car, okay?  Sure.  Actually, just give me your hands behind your back.  I'm gonna secure them, momentarily.  6-7-3-10-6-7-3.  6-7-3-10-6-7-3.  7th John Brown come for you.  Tell me what you want to do. ",
