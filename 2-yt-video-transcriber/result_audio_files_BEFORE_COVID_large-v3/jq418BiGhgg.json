Craig, or whoever's narrating this well-worn nonsense for him, claims that atheists expect theists to reconcile an all-powerful, all-loving God with the fact that suffering exists.  this isn't necessarily true and this choice of words represents our objection very poorly.  suffering is an abstract term that imprecisely describes a single component a single flavor of a lot of our experiences and the suffering itself cannot be singularly extracted from these experiences.  modest amounts of it can be interwoven with and even bleed into other sometimes positive emotions which actually makes it an important and powerful part of our lives.  to remove everything that includes some suffering is not realistic logical or even necessarily desirable.  So when the apologist uses an overly broad term like suffering.  in this context, when the conversation should be about unnecessary horrors and gratuitous violence for which there's no plausible justification, he's leaving the door open to distractions, giving himself room to explain why God allows us to stub our toes while hoping his audience forgets the fact that he just plopped down with a bucket of popcorn and watched the Holocaust.

            "text": "Ooh, now before we allow this square circle buffoonery to pass, we should back up and clarify which task we're actually talking about.  And I think the best way to do that is with an analogy.  Let's say a police officer sees a knife-wielding attacker coming at a woman in a dark alley.  The attacker is not exceptionally strong or fast, and any competent law enforcement professional should easily be able to intervene.  But instead, our officer just stands there and watches the victim get stabbed over and over until she bleeds out and dies.  Would we find this acceptable?  No.  And if we wanted to get all fancy and epicurean about it, we might phrase our criticism like this.  If the officer was willing to stop the stabbing but not able, then he is not competent.  If he was able to stop the stabbing but not willing, then he is a bad officer.  If he was both willing and able, then how could the stabbing have taken place?  And if he is neither able nor willing, then... Why call him a police officer?  I don't know.  I guess that's where the phrasing works.  better for God.  But the point is, we'd all agree that the officer sucked at his job and was a piece of shit person on top of it.  But let's add a justification into the mix.  As he's watching the gruesome scene unfold, he shrugs and says, Boy, what a shame.  But I can't force him to freely do good, at least without violating his free will, so what are you going to do?  Does this get him off the hook?  Of course not.  Nobody ever considered him obligated to force the criminal to freely do good.  To clear the low bar of not being a piece of shit person, all this officer had to do was protect someone from harm.  And if he tried to excuse himself from this achievable and necessary task by talking about the impossibility of the totally different task of forcing the criminal to want to be a good person, we'd all recognize his transparent attempt at changing the subject.  The fact is, he could have stopped the attack without violating free will.  Whether he had to use lethal force or could have instead tackled and subdued the attacker, no physical action he took would have altered the attacker's desires or anything else about his mindset.  The whole time he was being restrained and cuffed, the guy could have lain there squirming and foaming at the mouth and just wishing to death.  he could go stab someone.  Because free will is not compromised when someone is stopped from doing something.  So if the police or government or parents can restrain people for the sake of safety without violating free will, why can't God?  Further, if they're all morally obligated to do so as far as they're able when it protects people from harm, then why isn't God?  The Epicurean problem does not demand that God make people do good.  In fact, it doesn't demand that he alter their thinking or personalities at all.  It just calls for him to do something to curtail the impact of their bad actions on other people.  So fine, forcing free will agents to do good is as logically impossible as creating a square circle.  but you know what isn't as hard as creating a square circle?  Choosing to get out of your chair and do something instead of passively sitting there watching every single brutal act of murder, rape, torture, and child abuse that's ever happened in the history of humankind.  In other words, you can be better than a piece of shit without breaking any rules of logic.  That's all this logical problem is really demanding of God.  And bringing free will into it is deliberate misdirection. ",

If you're a Christian, sure, you might accept that literally any horrible thing can be justified as part of God's infinite plan, and you might do so without expecting His reasons to be demonstrated to your satisfaction.  But that's just because you're already parked in your belief system and accustomed to accepting it at face value.  You start off thinking he exists, he's God, and he's infinite.  So to you, a bald-faced declaration that everything might be part of a greater plan makes sense because you feel like it came from God.  But to everybody else, this excuse is worthless because it just came from another person.  To illustrate, let's switch roles for a moment.  If I brought you a rock and said it was God, you'd expect me to give you a really compelling reason to believe it, right?  In fact, I dare say you'd ask me why it just sits there being a rock, because nothing about sitting there being a rock seems very God-like.  So what would move you from thinking it was just a rock to thinking it was God?  You'd probably need some solid demonstration, or extremely spectacular explanation, of why this was the case.  But what if I just told you, well, the rock is infinitely intelligent, so if it seems silly to us that it would just sit there being a rock, that's just because its greater plan is beyond our finite understanding.  It might not make sense to us at the time, but how can we presume to understand an infinite God rock's reasons for sitting there being a rock?  So you see what I just did?  I showed you something with apparently mundane qualities, a rock, and made an assertion, which is that it was God.  Then, instead of demonstrating anything God-like about it, I just made a second assertion, which was that it had an incomprehensible purpose for looking mundane.  Now think about how badly this fails and why.  You as a human can't just assert something's God, then think you've gotten any traction with a non-believer by asserting something about that claimed God's properties.  Sure, it might tie up internal inconsistencies for people who already believe, but that's it.  So please understand that when you point to something as mundane as a universe full of random and sometimes awful events and assert that God's in charge of it, you need to show us why in terms that are accessible and make sense to us.  You can't just make a second assertion that he has reasons beyond our comprehension.  Since no God is speaking up, we are just stuck with humans weaving webs of excuses for something that looks natural.  And that's sure not going to push me toward believing in God. ",
