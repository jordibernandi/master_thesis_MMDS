            "text": "You said cellular.  Bye!  Hello, everybody, for movie four of the Chris-travaganza!  I watched Cellular from 2004, and I had a coworker who told me that this wasn't a good movie, and that the cell phone was the star, and that coworker was wrong!  So Cellular was directed by David R. Ellis, who I had not heard of before, but I did actually look at the other things that he's directed, and among them are cinematic masterpieces such as Snakes on a Plane, and at least two of the Final Destination movies.  I mean, my expectations weren't super high, but I think going into it knowing that that's what this director had done, I actually appreciated this movie more than I might have otherwise.  So my arbitrary category is from Le Bas Fond Musique.  I hope I am saying that right.  I see you all the time.  I'm really glad that I got... your suggestion, but I wasn't really sure how this was gonna fit in.  Anyway, the category is any or all obscure and long-running jokes.  And so I really just picked jokes that I really liked or that I thought were like things that people could pick up on 15 years after this movie was made because it's very much a product if it's time.  A 10th grade biology teacher is kidnapped in the light of day from her own home and MacGyver's a phone.  It calls a Nokia brick of a phone.  And that just happens to be Chris Evans' character's phone.  His name is Ryan.  And the rest of the movie is Ryan trying to save this woman and her family.  because he was roped into this.  Overall, quite enjoyable.  I think you'll be surprised by what I have to say about it.  I was definitely surprised by how invested in this movie I was.  On to pros and cons.  It was on Netflix and captions were available, and unlike Not Another Teen Movie, the captions were actually spot-on pretty much the whole movie.  There's pleasant music at the opening.  I kind of liked that.  Ryan is very pretty.  Not bright, but pretty.  There are police jokes, like stuff about eating donuts, which are also fat jokes, so not great.  Not my favorite ones.  Kim Basinger is giving her all.  She gives 100% to this part.  And honestly, going off of that, There wasn't a performance that I didn't like except for the one like skeezy lawyer guy who really is only vaguely involved whatsoever.  Kim Basinger's character's name is Jessica Martin and her son, who's 11, is Ricky Martin.  And Ryan, as he learns that his name is Ricky Martin, is like, you named your child Ricky Martin?  Ryan is constantly doing the right thing.  Doesn't matter if it breaks the law or not, Ryan is like, this is what I have to do to save this woman!  It's the right thing to do!  The extremely outdated telephone technology was very funny to me.  That's one of the things that, like, a product of his time does not make it a bad thing.  The child has a Lord of the Rings backpack.  Ryan is at least polite when he has to steal cars.  Ryan stashes a gun on one of the kidnappers post-9-11 at an airport, but it turned out that the kidnapper, they're all cops.  I genuinely thought that throughout the movie there was a good buildup of tension, and knowing that this director also did Final Destination, not surprised.  All of the criminals are cops.  Jessica cuts a guy using 10th grade biology logic, and it's kind of fantastic.  So at the climax of the movie, they're at Santa Monica Pier, and the one bad guy is like... He's the one on the cell phone. ",

            "text": "thought that was like a running joke that still holds up today.  Ryan gets involved in this whole thing while he's trying to impress his ex-girlfriend Chloe, who's played by Jessica Biel, and he gives up on that need to impress her in order to save her life.  And he doesn't have to insult her to save her.  Jessica really does the heavy lifting in her family, to the point where, like, she is the one out of the three members of her own family that really does the most harm to the bad guys.  Jessica's kind of a badass, and she's allowed to cry throughout the whole movie.  The one F-word in the PG-13 movie was used so well, I thought it was probably the best one-liner in the movie.  It's a day spa, you... Those are all of my pros.  I actually only have a few more cons than pros this time, because again, I actually genuinely enjoyed this movie.  The child, the Martin child, Ricky Martin, he thinks that his mother is like being overly gross when she teases him about affection.  There's a slow-mo turn of Kim Basinger, and I knew that by watching how fast her hair turns.  Early on in the kidnapping, I thought Jessica should have taken her shoes off because she was wearing heels and they were making a lot of noise on the hardwood floor of the room she was being kept in.  If she wanted to be discreet, she needed to take them off.  Eric Christian Olsen is in it.  He's also in Not Another Teen Movie, which I didn't like his character in that either.  He's also introduced by videotaping hot chicks walking in their bikinis.  Man, this is the greatest cell phone ever made.  Because they had to show off the fact that the phones had cameras in 2004.  I guess.  Ryan coerces his friend into doing something that he doesn't want to do because will be involved because that woman doesn't have a name, apparently.  I did notice that Jessica was wearing fishnets.  That's just a weird... choice.  The costume designer was a man for this movie, so I'm not surprised.  I wrote Nokia brick phone as a con.  When Jessica first manages to get Ryan on the phone, he's kind of an asshole.  To some extent, you should just be like, okay, I'll call the cops for you.  But to another extent, I can kind of understand where he's like, I don't know who you are.  I have no way of knowing if you're telling the truth.  You just called my phone.  Ryan tells Jessica, You know, this has been really fun, but now you're wasting my minutes.  William H. Macy is a cop in this movie, and that's only a con now, for the same reason that watching The Perfect Score now is kind of ironic.  There are no police around, ever except at the station.  Ryan pulls a damn gun and nobody calls the cops.  There are like a few car chase scenes where Ryan is clearly going over the speed limit and causes many, many accidents and there's never a cop on the road when he needs one or when one should be.  like, pulling him over and arresting him, probably?  Jessica's lipstick is perfect throughout this entire movie.  It is never smudged once.  William H. Macy goes to Jessica's house but never asks the woman who answers the door that is not Jessica for any form of ID.  He just accepts that she's Jessica Martin because she says so.  He's just not a very good police officer.  I just want to know what kind of dirty cops leave the keys to their car inside the car!  They are asking for that car to be stolen by the victim that they're keeping.  Oh, and I hate the end credits.  I hate them so much.  They are the worst.  They're so bad.  I don't know if I hate this more than the Scantrons from The Perfect Score.  They may just be at the same level of me absolutely detesting what people thought was a creative way to do credits.  The IMDb score is 6.5.  The Rotten Tomatoes score was an average of 57.  My score was actually a 7.  I liked it.  I actually really liked it.  It's better than the other three that I've watched put together.  I had not seen it before, and the total point value for cellular is 70.5.  So the next movie is Fierce People, which was released in 2005, and I'm kind of excited for it.  It sounds like a hot, hot mess, but in the best way.  And I'm excited for it, especially for the cast.  So I will talk about that next time.  Bye! ",
