I rode up on these people all the time.  I put my bike right next to them.  This is retaliation.  This is obvious retaliation.  This isn't going to stop me.  This is going to make me do it more and more and more.  That roll call shit, that doesn't scare me either.  This is all fear and intimidation tactics.  that doesn't scare somebody like me.  It's too bad that you're involved with this, man.  It really is.  It really is.  Has it already been posted about you that you're a good cop and you're doing the good shit?  It's your duty to step in and say, dude, this is retaliation.  This is not right.  I've seen him been doing it.  This is not a big deal.  It's not busy.  Nobody's up and down the sidewalk.  Nobody's really on this pedestrian.  I rode in here when it was busy, busy, busy.  And the cops don't say nothing.  Just happens that Officer Regan here, after getting about 6,000 views on YouTube, Big Ego Regan, sees me for the first time out, and now all of a sudden I'm pulled over on my bicycle.  That's that Big Ego he's got, that's why.  Did you call this in?  Because I'm going to FOIA request a call, but if you didn't, that's something else too.  I hope you called it in.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it called in, Officer Regan.  Do your superiors know you're doing this?  I did ask for a supervisor.  Why didn't I get a supervisor?  So now just because he busts my balls, everyone you see riding up and down here, you're going to ask to get off the bike and walk, right?  That's what's going to end up happening?  It's crazy.  I'm going to go take video pictures that there's no signs on either end. ",

That's all I'm trying to do is point out the bad pops, the ones that don't even want to identify.  There's a reason why they don't want to identify, because they're crooked and tyrannical.
