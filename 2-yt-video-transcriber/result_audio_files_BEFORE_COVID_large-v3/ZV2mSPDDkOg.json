It's a lot of pressure for me to be the person that I want to be before I die.  Even if I don't get to do all the many things I want to do with my life, there's a sort of simple beauty to it all.  I don't want to make this video.  It hurts everything inside of me to have to make this video.  So pretty much, I'm getting new lungs.  And it's very exciting.  And also completely terrifying but exciting.  But I can't work and you need tons of money to be able to get through a transplant.  I have a GoFundMe.  I'm so uncomfortable.  Yeah, there's a GoFundMe link down below and I would be tremendously grateful if you donated.  Have a great day, you know.  Go enjoy your life, really.  I mean that seriously, not in a sarcastic way.  Go enjoy it, because there's people who are fighting like hell for it.  You know? ",

I don't have any words, really, to say how grateful I am.  Like there's no way, there's no way to describe it.  So I guess now it's just a matter of getting the lungs and doing this, you know?  So I guess let's do this.  It's terrifying to be invested in life.  It's one of the most terrifying things you can do because you know inevitably at the end you're going to lose.  But it's also the thing that makes your life really worth anything.  This year has been a big testament to caring and to throwing yourself into things even though you know you're going to lose.  And that's kind of where I'm at.  So in the end, I'm not even really losing.  Yeah.  So bad gay subscribe. ",
