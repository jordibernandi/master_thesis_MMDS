Specifically in the Tucson area, that's the headquarters for the missile division.  I think they operate out of Air Force Plant 44, and they've been there for quite some time.  And if you're not familiar with Raytheon, you may be familiar with some of the actual missile names if you've heard them in past engagements.  Things like the Sidewinder, the Tomahawk missile, There's a really interesting named one called an Exo-Atmospheric Kill Vehicle.  I love the name of that for some strange reason.  The Stinger and the Patriot missiles, you've heard of those, I'm sure, as well.  And they've got many, many others.  Very large missile manufacturer. ",

We've had people that worked there and said that they were on high alert.  That was about four or five months ago.  There was a woman who called in and said that her, I believe, husband was... Basically saying that the entire place, which is run like a base, was on high alert.  And then that was kind of, you know, nobody really mentioned it since then.

They basically describe the environment at Raytheon for the past year or so as being an all-out production, like cranking missiles out faster than they've ever done it before.  Matter of fact, I think the description was they have never seen this type of scale and magnitude of production before.  except for one other time in their history, and that was the lead-up to the Gulf confrontation in the Gulf.  I don't want to use the W word there.  And apparently they're pumping out like a missile every minute and 30 seconds.  So do the math on that. ",

And basically everyone there is on edge, is the description I was given.  And it's so out of the norm.  is the description I was given.

            "text": "Yeah, so it's actually \u2013 it's really interesting.  So the call \u2013 I ended up having two calls with the person.  So first off, they were calling to tell us about the environment and what was happening and gave a couple of other examples like there was \u2013 one day they came into work and the parking lots were full and there were crates everywhere and tarps over everything and there was nowhere to park.  And it turned out that they were expanding the \u2013 the name of it, the \u2013 Iron Dome, I think, is the technology.  Now, what I wasn't sure, they actually thought that they had deployed the Iron Dome there.  I'm not 100% confident on that.  I do know, and I did confirm through some research, that the Raytheon company was tapped by the other country that begins with an I that makes the Iron Dome to actually build the missiles for it.  So there is a connection there.  So, like, these... strange things that have happened that are really a big deal and are just really stretching the group.  The other one they were telling us about was they have a $2 billion order that is boxed, shipped, and ready to go for the Saudis, right?  Saudi Arabia.  And at the last second, the U.S.  says, no, we're not shipping it to them.  They're pulling back on it.  Now, this is kind of interesting because I don't know if this is, you know, as the a $2 billion order for a large company like Raytheon is a big deal, right?  And a lot of red tape had to go through, a lot of hoops were jumped through, a lot of I's were dotted and P's were crossed to get that deal.  And you don't just walk away from $2 billion.  So something is up there.  And I don't know if the U.S.  is wanting to retain that equipment or if they're using it as some sort of leverage with the Saudis.  But I was told there is a complete order ready to roll for $2 billion worth of equipment.  They were going to ship it out, and boom, it was pulled back, and they can't have it now.  So that was the gist of the call.  And to your point, Adam, something alarming happened.  So as if that wasn't alarming enough, like the rate of missile production, the tension that's in the air, the fact that everybody's just really on high alert, this person walks out of work today to the parking lot, leaving the day job for the day, and there is a line, more than he can count, of semi-trucks, and these trucks are actually coming in to ship product out, and this is not normal.  It's normal for them to ship a product out, and it's normal for them to do trucks, but never to be this many, more than he can count.  He said it was very much like a drill, like a surreal environment.  There were semi-tractor trailers everywhere.  They were unmarked, and they were all accompanied with multiple trucks undercover or unmarked, you know, we would presume some sort of security vehicles that would be traveling with these trucks. ",

Are they going to a nearby airfield to then be transported, or are they trucking these to San Diego, to the naval base, to Corpus Christi, which would be the other closest naval base, to load up onto ships?

I have a prediction that we are going to see stories about this name and this company in the next few weeks.  And you heard it here first on Marfugal News.  Well, thank you, Dex, for getting all of that information for us.  Thank you for taking the risk of even saying it.

I'm not trying to scare anyone.  In fact, I really hope people understand that this could be very normal, but we are passing along the information.  We are the middlemen and we are trying to get out information, doing our best to get it out before uh others do and we have done it several times in the past.  we get a lot of i guess flack for doing things uh.  but then it ends up being worth it in the end when six weeks later four weeks later uh we actually had the story before all of these huge huge um conglomerates and all these huge news companies that you know obviously nobody's going to anymore.  In fact, all the sources that used to go to those places are now going to this platform because this is where some of the most real stuff is.  But again, I have to say, we take everything with a grain of salt here as well.  We're just trying to do our service.  If you guys want more information, if anything else comes out, if we get more of anything, we are going to put that out in our next Marfugal Alerts.  Again, you can go to marfugalnews.com and go to the top.  In fact, I'll just show you real quick.  uh... just so you can know exactly how to get there.  and we pay to make this a private service.  we pay mailchimp to actually get this.  we've made it uh... european compliance and no matter where you are in the world uh... we can keep connected with you.  because if this platform ends up deciding that we basically or you know three strikes you're out kind of thing if if we are basically taken off.  We will always be able to be connected with the Fugle family and to the community that we've built here.  So go to marfuglenews.com and you can get our alerts or you can get into our discord, get into your state group.  I cannot tell you how important this is.  So this website right here up at the top, uh... you can actually see it says join discord and alerts.  you can get in there.  you can either choose our alerts or choose our discord or choose both uh... discord.  there's a state group for almost well all fifty states and other countries so you can prepare with like-minded individuals and then of course on the alerts side you can get a email from us when we have uh... stuff that we can't share here on this platform.  in fact some of it we can share on twitter instagram anywhere.  So we directly send that to you.  Anything that happens, we are going to let you know first.  As soon as we find out something, we are going to let you know.  So that is what we are working towards.  We are working hard behind the scenes to try to make this something real and something that will last.  And again, the odds are against us.  Any kind of information like this, they definitely... do not like some of the things we do here.  So, well, thank you, Dex.  I really appreciate you doing all this.  And yeah, I guess we will see what happens. ",
