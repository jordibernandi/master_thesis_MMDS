            "text": "One of the four scientists who discovered DNA, James Watson, remarked, there's a difference on the average between blacks and whites on IQ tests.  I would say the difference is it's genetic.  This erroneous analysis completely disregards a host of environmental and historical factors.  Sadly, this wasn't the late scientist's first racist comment, nor is his idea new in the world of white supremacy.  But where did the myth of black intellectual inferiority come from?  A long history of racism and deprivation of resources.  By the 1830s, phrenology was a popular pseudoscience in America in which whites believed they could determine mental capacity and penchant for crime by the shape of one's head.  Black people were considered to be especially feeble-minded.  Keep in mind that in most southern states, it was illegal to teach slaves how to read, though some masters ignored this rule.  For some, it was convenient to have slaves who could read, and some felt morally obligated by God to give their slaves a way to connect with him.  Most masters, however, did not think that allowing their slaves to read for themselves about slavery or Moses and the Bible was a good idea.  As an 1862 newspaper said, the reading of the scriptures is not essential to the salvation of slaves.  Faith cometh by hearing.  Oral communication has ever been God's chosen method of saving sinners.  After Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831, white people grew shook and placed heavier restrictions on slaves gaining literacy.  seeking to keep them from encountering any abolitionist material.  For example, in 1841, Mississippi made all free blacks leave the state to keep them from trying to educate or incite slaves.  A few people, including whites, risked life and limb to educate black people during the antebellum period, despite these laws against literacy.  One such person was Mathilda Taylor Beasley, who ran an illegal school for black children from her home in Savannah, Georgia.  In 1847, Missouri banned all education of blacks, so a former slave named John Barry Meacham started a floating school on a steamboat on the Mississippi River.  Despite efforts such as these, the overwhelming majority of southern blacks stayed illiterate well into the 20th century.  Free Northern blacks had a better chance at learning as education programs had been established by the Quakers.  After emancipation, ex-slaves desperately wanted to gain literacy and or build schools for their children.  Southern white elites didn't want universal schooling as they believed.  ignorant, poor white and black populations were critical to maintaining the class and therefore political system that gave them power.  Nonetheless, before the Freedmen's Bureau arrived, former slaves in states like Louisiana and Georgia established schools for black children.  With black people being elected to local and state governments, universal education became a priority.  White planners hated that blacks were being educated as this translated into a shortage of cheap labor.  So when Reconstruction ended by 1877 and white elites took complete political control, they stressed low taxes, which meant less school funding, and they also opposed compulsory attendance laws, blocked education legislation, and reestablished forced labor via sharecropping.  Fast forward to the 1920s when universal education became more widespread.  The notion of inferior black intellect was not helped by court decisions like Plessy versus Ferguson's separate but equal mandate.  As whites have generally made more money and were more likely to be homeowners than black people, their property taxes paid for better schools that black children weren't allowed access to.  Despite barring most black people from being literate or gaining quality educations, whites deluded themselves into believing the pillars of scientific racism, that they were mentally superior to all races.  By the 1920s, progressive social scientists all agreed blacks and other undesirables were intellectually inferior, and desired a way to prove this so that they could back policies that benefited a particular type of white people.  Think eugenics, miscegenation laws, immigration restrictions, and forced sterilization.  One surviving tentacle of scientific racism are the SATs, which was first administered in 1926.  The test was adapted from the practical IQ test created by French psychologist Alfred Binet, who believed intelligence wasn't just based on genetics, but environment too.  American psychologist and eugenicist Lewis Terman took Binet's test and revised it on the premise that it would be curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial inefficiency.  He also was noted as saying blacks are uneducable beyond the nearest rudiments of training.  No amount of school instruction will ever make them intelligent voters or capable citizens in the sense of the world.  His revised IQ test, along with the fear of racial infiltration brought on by scientific racism and eugenics advocates, led Dr.  Carl Brigham to develop the SAT.  Like many of his scientific racist peers, Carl thought that white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were the cream of the crop and everybody else was inferior, particularly blacks who were at the bottom.  Though Brigham theorized that the SAT's alleged objectivity would keep minorities out of the highest rungs of society by naturally demonstrating their intellectual inferiority, they did just the opposite.  The SAT showed that scientific racism was a farce.  After Brown versus Board of Education, school districts continued to block the educational opportunities of blacks.  For instance, as late as 1960, Mississippi was spending four times as much money on white students than black ones.  This atrocious disadvantage was reflected in a 1964 report that less than 5% of black adults had a high school diploma in Mississippi.  In the battle against integrating schools, many districts defunded public school budgets to spite black students while white ones were shipped to private schools.  In Prince Edward County, Virginia, public schools were closed for five years while officials refused to integrate, meaning the bulk of the black population who couldn't attend makeshift church schools or schools in other counties went without an education.  Scientific racism stayed relevant even after being formally denounced in the 1950s.  It was still used by racists to justify discrimination and explain black illiteracy rates and IQ test statistics.  Take a 1966 Playboy interview by Roots author Alex Haley of the American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell.  He stated, To him and people like him, we weren't only ignorant, but incapable of ever reaching the level of whites because we lacked the mental capacity.  And in his view, the smartest blacks were the ones who had white ancestry, which is a concept reflected by elitist black circles during the 19th and 20th centuries.  Scientific racism is a wonderful way to absolve white people of their responsibility in the barriers that face black intellectual development, and the belief that black people are mentally inferior still clings today, as shown by studies that reveal black children encounter bias from white teachers who underestimate their intelligence at a rate higher than white students.  When compounded with curriculum that minimally includes black history and centers the white middle class experience, plus disproportionate expulsion and suspension rates, it's no surprise that American public schools don't fully nurture the brains of black children.  When they have a public school-honed aversion to reading and critical thinking, they're easier to control.  I want you to consider the importance of education and how depriving low-income black people quality access to it has affected our experience.  I'm talking generational wealth, employment opportunities, and everything else.  In a 2014 study of all 97,000 public schools in the US, it was found that black students are three times more likely than whites to attend schools where fewer than 60% of teachers meet all state certification and licensure requirements.  Black public school students are also more likely to be taught by first year students than white kids, three times more likely to be expelled for similar infractions, and have less access to advanced math and science courses.  Predominantly black schools tend to have older and more poorly maintained infrastructure, along with inadequate heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and lighting.  There's a reason why slaves largely weren't allowed to read.  There's a reason why white southern elites were against universal education.  There's a reason why black intellectuals are celebrated less than black entertainers and athletes.  And there's a reason why black schools have been underfunded.  Lastly, there's a reason why studies have shown that many white people believe black people are intellectually inferior.  It's time we talk about it. ",
