            "text": "Leading Christian author and founder of Focus on the Family, James Dobson, has just issued a dire warning to you, the American people.  You see, Mr.  Dobson was invited by the White House to go to the border at McAllen, Texas.  Well, what he found there was staggering, and he's now issued a straight-up warning.  But before I get into the report, I want to give a quick shout out to my partner at TrumpCoin2020.com.  Right now, they have an amazing special and they're offering a five ounce America the Beautiful coin that features George Washington on the front, in addition to a one ounce Trump coin.  And right now, if you use the code LISAHAVEN25, you can get $25 off the deal.  So get it today at TrumpCoin2020.com.  Back to the report.  So just what is James Dobson warning us about?  Well, take a look at his actual website where he published the letter in full.  Now, I'm not going to read to you the entire thing, but just highlighted sections.  But the letter states, and I quote, several weeks ago, I was invited by White House staff to visit our southern border at McAllen, Texas, where federal agents are struggling to deal with a massive influx of poor and destitute human beings.  They come in never-ending waves.  Please believe me when I tell you that the media and leftist politicians have not been truthful about what is going on there.  It is a human tragedy.  It goes on, Approximately 5,500 people show up every day in districts organized along our southern U.S.  border.  McAllen is the site of only one of them, but it is the busiest and most besieged.  Let me just pause right there.  What James Dobson is saying here is that People are coming across the border, kidnapping children, claiming that the kids are their children in order to quote unquote, get a free pass into America.  This is happening not once, but thousands of times.  Not only has James Dobson reported on this, but many from border patrol have also been stating this.  But it goes on a little further and he writes, last year, 382,000 aliens were apprehended for illegally crossing into this country.  and almost 100,000 of them were minors.  Some of the kids have been abused along the way.  Many of them carry lice, scabies, or other diseases.  Currently, the facility I visited is experiencing a flu epidemic, and there are no additional beds on which to lie.  Some of the women have been raped, and more than 70% of the people ages are sent to local hospitals daily along the southern border.  Doctors and medical staff are overwhelmed by their patient load.  Remember that word overwhelmed.  It describes every aspect of the effort to deal with the situation there.  It goes on, my heart aches for the poor people.  Least I be misunderstood, let me make it clear that I am among the majority of Americans who want the border to be closed to those who attempt to enter illegally.  There has to be a better solution than this.  I have wondered, with you, why the authorities don't just deny the refugees access to this nation.  Can't we just send them back to their place of origin?  The answer I received was no, for reasons I will explain.  The simple solution would be to send these illegal immigrants back to their countries.  But unfortunately, the democratic arm here in the U.S.  prevents that.  But James Domson goes on a little further and he states, here's something else you should know.  I have been under the impression that these would-be immigrants tried across the Rio Grande River and outrun or evade the agents.  That is not true of most.  They come in large groups from 100 to 400 people at a time.  As I write this, a record 1,200 people arrived together in El Paso.  The refugees quickly give themselves up to agents.  That is why they have made this journey.  They know they will be fed, medicated, and treated humanely, even if they are in holding areas where they are in our custody.  Then they will be released on American soil.  This is the system set up by a liberal Congress and judges.  It is a well-known fact that President Obama's administration established many of these unworkable policies, and Congress is steadfast, unwilling to change them.  Every effort of reform has been overridden or ignored.  It is set in stone.  Democrats want massive numbers of immigrants who will someday become voters.  Some Republicans support the policies because they want cheap labor for agricultural purposes.  The border could be fixed, but there are very few in authority who seem to care.  What he's saying here is that Congress refuses to act, that those on the Democratic side could care less about the people at the border.  The real motive behind the Democratic arm is, well, they want their votes.  even though they're not quote unquote supposed to be voting, well, in time, wink wink, they will vote.  Unfortunately, many are already voting in the voting system.  But that's not all, he goes on to state, lawless gangs such as MS-13 are already pouring into the culture, making violence for inner cities a way of life.  He concludes, the situation I have described is the reason President Donald Trump's border wall is so urgently needed.  He seems to be the only leader in America who comprehends this tragedy and is willing to address it.  Those who oppose him do everything they can to impede his effort.  That is why I went to the border to see the situation for myself.  I came away with an array of intense emotions.  First, I was profoundly grieved over the misery of thousands of people.  Second, I felt a deep appreciation for those who are doing their best to help in an impossible circumstance.  Third, and frankly, I was angry by the political fat cats who have deliberately allowed this chaos to occur for political or financial gain.  They and their friends in the fake media have told the American people that there is no crisis on the border.  Shame on them all.  What I've told you is only a glimpse of what is occurring on the nation's border.  I don't know what it will take to change the circumstances.  I can only report that without an overhaul of the law and the allocation of resources, millions of illegal immigrants will continue to flood to this great land from around the world.  Many of them have no marketable skills.  They are illiterate and unhealthy.  Some are violent criminals.  Their numbers will soon overwhelm the culture as we have known it, and it could bankrupt the nation.  I think he made it very clear in his report that if something isn't done about it, our nation is going to be bankrupt.  Something that I've again brought up on my channel numerous times.  You see, the Democratic Party doesn't care to make America great again.  All they want is the votes from those people.  You see, because we here in America know exactly the game that the Democrats are playing.  They've taken over social media.  They've taken over Hollywood.  They've taken over television and TV series and Netflix and even some of our radio broadcasts, not to mention our schools, our colleges.  all taken by Democratic operatives pushing a progressive socialist agenda.  And that agenda, obviously, is a New World Order globalist one.  Something that the Bible even warns about.  I don't know about you, but I agree with Mr.  Dobson's assessment.  Something needs to be done at the border.  There is a crisis.  We need to build the wall.  And people need to wake up to the scams of the Democratic Party.  Anyhow, I wanted to bring you the latest on all of that.
