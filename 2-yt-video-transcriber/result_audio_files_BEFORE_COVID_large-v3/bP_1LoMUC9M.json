            "text": "Me and other content creators have been working tirelessly against an organization that seeks to have LGBTQ people executed.  But this video isn't for them, because there are more organizations than just them that seek the exact same thing.  This is a video for the people who these organizations think should be put to death for the mere crime of existing.  Some of them are comfortable showing their faces.  Some are not.  and it is for their safety that some people are using either avatars or screen names rather than faces or legal names.  It is due to the existence of social norms brought about by organizations like the NIFB and others that think like them that this is necessary.  If you are part of one of these organizations, then maybe it would behoove you to listen to the words and see the faces of people who you think don't deserve the right to exist. ",
