            "text": "Over here.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Secretary Carson, I have waited a long time for this moment.  But the residents of my district, the 7th Congressional in Massachusetts, have been waiting far longer for your agency to do its job.  Colleagues across the aisle earlier were critical of the passion and even the outrage that we've expressed on this side of the aisle.  I make no apologies for that.  This matter is very, very personal.  Let me be clear.  Housing is a fundamental human right, and the displacement of families should be regarded as the public health crisis that it is.  Mr.  Secretary, your pioneering work in pediatric neurology is historic.  And it is something to be commended.  And so it pains me that your gifted hands and mind are doing the bidding and carrying the water of what I believe to be one of the most morally bankrupt presidents in our nation's history, increasing rents, evicting families.  You mentioned that the operating room was a safe haven away from all the troubles of the world.  Safe haven, that's exactly what a home should be.  and what every single person, and in particular our children, deserve.  Today you are not here as a doctor or even as our Surgeon General, which I think might be better suited for your talents, but as the official tasked with leading the agency overseeing our nation's crumbling housing stock.  And for that, I do believe you are unqualified.  You said this was... not a political matter, but it does seem that political views are being played out in the policies that are being rolled out every single day.  When you imply that people are living in public housing either because of a desire to be self-sufficient, questioning a work ethic, when we are eliminating a stock but not Increasing supply, people in the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District would have to work 84 hours to afford a decent one-bedroom at fair market rent.  Doris Bunty was a former Massachusetts state representative in my district and was the first African-American woman to hold the position of head of BHA, the first public housing tenant to lead a public housing agency in a major city.  She said being poor is not a character flaw.  I agree.  But again, given your medical background, perhaps you could weigh in on the health consequences of failing to invest in safe housing.  Mr.  Secretary, since I am short on time here, yes or no, is stable and safe housing a social determinant of health? ",

But I think it's important to notice that this is not about throwing more money to the problem.  This is about throwing the money at the problem.  NYCHA and public housing across the country has been starved by members of Congress and for over fifteen years and that deficit has built up for for many many years which has led to in new york city alone thirty two billion dollar price tag to make sure that we get people basic heat hot water and so on.  and i don't think that uh... you know no matter what policy changes we make.  You can't take food away from a child and then not understand why they can't or don't eat.  And I think that that's exactly what's happening with our public housing program.

That tripling of cost in servicing, which then has the effect of reducing the credit availability to the American people, because when you drive up servicing costs, then servicers overlay with cost overlays, and it makes the loans more expensive for the very homeowners that FHA is designed to serve.
