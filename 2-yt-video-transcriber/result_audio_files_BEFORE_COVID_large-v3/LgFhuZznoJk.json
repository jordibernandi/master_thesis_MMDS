            "text": "Hello and welcome to my channel!  Viced Rhino here.  Today I'm not doing a response video, instead I'd like to discuss what I see as one of the biggest problems with theistic religions, especially ones that claim their god is all-powerful and wants us to hear his message.  So let's go!  One of the main reasons I don't believe in the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing deity who is personally involved in people's lives and wants those people's love, approval, and worship is that the existence of such a being just does not fit with the reality that we see.  We see a world where there are millions of gods spread out across thousands of religions.  In most of these religions, we see adherents who have testimonies about their personal interaction with their deity.  these interactions are often used to justify their belief in their deity which would be fine except they are not exclusive to any one religion.  speaking of the christian god in particular if this god will only rescue you from the pits of hell if you accept jesus as your lord and saviour before you die why would he not personally reveal himself to everybody?  why would he allow experiences of personal interaction with other gods in other religions?  why is it that these revelations seem to follow patterns that would be expected if there was no god guiding them.  most people have revelations from the god or gods that they already believe in.  if it is from a god they don't believe in it's from one that they are frequently exposed to in their culture and on extremely rare occasions you do get revelations from someone who was recently exposed to a new god but never not once has there ever been any documented case of a revelation coming to someone from an already extant religion that they have never heard of.  If God does get personally involved with his creation and he reveals himself to everybody, or at least to the people who are open to that sort of experience, then why is he unable to reveal himself to someone who has not already heard of him?  Why were none of the Native American tribes Christian before Europeans came and exposed them to Christianity?  Why were there no European Hindus before Europeans went to India?  not once has any religion developed twice independently.  if god is all-powerful and wants us to know him why would he not let people know about him in the same way regardless of geography?  I know several people who are convinced that they have a personal relationship with Jesus.  And when I was a Christian, I was convinced that I also had a personal relationship with Jesus.  But the interesting thing was that any time I had to ask Jesus for advice on anything, he almost always came back with the answer that I wanted to hear.  And when most people think about it honestly, I think they would come to the same conclusion.  i remember one of the churches i attended.  the pastor wanted to renovate the church but the church did not have the funds required when he wanted to do it and did not bring in enough income to pay off the loans for it.  he took out a massive loan anyway started the renovations and announced that god had told him just to jump in and do it.  god would take care of the details himself.  funny how a wise god would coach someone against fiscal responsibility.  the church was struggling then and from all appearances it is still struggling now.  but the pastor drives a brand new b m w because god told him to go ahead and buy it.  is it really a relationship if the person you claim to have the relationship with just agrees with you all the time?  that's not a relationship.  that's a yes man and when you can't even demonstrate that the person you have the relationship with exists in reality then it becomes all the more doubtful that this is actually a real relationship.  now don't get me wrong.  i don't doubt the sincerity of a lot of people's personal beliefs.  i'm sure most christians really do believe that they have a personal relationship with jesus christ just like i did but this relationship appears for all intents and purposes to be an illusion.  so we have an all-powerful god who wants to have a personal relationship with you but when you enter into a relationship with him he just agrees with everything that you have to say and in important decisions he usually pushes you to whichever decision you wanted to make in the first place which makes it appear as though he isn't really there.  but wait there are times when god disagrees with the people that are praying to him.  yes i don't doubt that there were times when people wanted to make a decision spent some time in prayer and came to the opposite decision of what they were thinking before the prayer but this appears to be nothing more than the consequences of articulating your ideas or decisions.  every one has had an experience where they have a thought.  it seems like a good idea at the time but then as soon as they say it out loud they realize it's actually a pretty bad idea.  what is prayer other than articulating your ideas?  it stands to reason that when you talk to yourself about the pros and cons of a decision it is possible to change your own mind and this realization that you are considering the wrong decision is seen as the holy spirit or equivalent nudging you in the correct direction.  so here we have two phenomena that is a personal relationship with a deity and experiencing the deity's supposed guidance through prayer which either have perfectly natural explanations or are universal experiences the details of which appear to be tailored to the culture in which they take place.  so far this is not convincing evidence of an all-powerful all-knowing being that wants a relationship with you.  but what about the holy books?  surely one of these is a message from god?  right maybe but let's think for a moment about what a book might look like if it were really a communication from an all-knowing all-powerful god who had a message that he wanted to get across to us.  clearly an all-powerful all knowing god would be able to write his own book in all languages past present and future.  but the holy books we have are all written in primitive languages and then translated by mere humans into modern languages extremely imperfectly.  but let's pretend for a moment that god had a reason for wanting his communication to us written in ancient hebrew or arabic or vedic sanskrit or whatever other ancient language the other holy books have been written in.  maybe he wanted it in those languages because those languages were so primitive that they left a lot up to interpretation and that way god could leave a deeper message inside the text.  okay possibly i might be able to buy that.  so what might that kind of text look like?  well if it were truly authored by an infallible all-powerful god then surely this god would know how to make his book perfect.  regardless of how we translate it it should avoid even the appearance of contradiction or error.  but alas i am not aware of any holy book that meets this requirement.  if god knows everything and is all-powerful then making sure his important message is transmitted perfectly should be a piece of cake should it not?  but it isn't.  there is no holy book that i know of which is not riddled with problems.  these can range from simple contradictions like judas dying in more than one way in the new testament to massive scientific errors like the vishnu purana's seven seas that separate the seven islands of the earth the sea of salt water butter wine curd milk cane juice and sweet water.  no matter the size of the apparent error the fact remains there are passages in every holy book that at the very least have the appearance of being in error.  sure there are apologetics that can make some of the apparent errors go away.  for the story of judas death we have two passages.  one that says judas gave the silver back to the priest and then hanged himself in a non-specified location followed by the priest buying the potter's field with the money as a burial place for strangers.  it is then named the field of blood because it was bought with blood money.  the other passage says that judas bought a field himself with the silver and then died by falling in the field headlong and having his guts spill out.  the apologetic for this one is something along the lines of him hanging himself in the field his corpse hanging there for several days getting all bloated and then finally falling to the ground and bursting open.  i consider this to be a rather flimsy explanation since it makes it quite clear in both cases who bought the field with matthew having the priest buying it and acts having judah spying it himself.  but let's ignore that for a second and pretend that this explanation can completely harmonize the different accounts.  why would an all-powerful all-knowing god who wanted to communicate clearly with us have two books written that require mental gymnastics in order to clear up their contradictions?  Could he not have just written the Bible to be completely free of even the appearance of contradiction?  I know it's a big complicated book, but surely God could have kept track of everything to make it fit together perfectly, right?  Let's continue to pretend that the two accounts can work together once you have the full context.  Was God not capable of providing the full context in the original text, whichever one came first?  could he not have said in matthew that after judas hanged himself his body fell and burst asunder or whatever in acts?  could he not have mentioned that the falling headlong was a description of the already dead body falling?  if a mere mortal such as myself can think of a better way to word something to make it avoid the appearance of a contradiction then surely an all-knowing omnipotent god would have no trouble whatsoever right?  the only reason for an all-powerful all knowing being to communicate in a way that is not clear is really quite simple.  it didn't want to.  if a god exists it did not want to give humanity a clear communication of anything and this is evidenced by the fact that it has not done so.  i mean in the bible.  it couldn't even get the ten commandments right twice in a row.  but i don't think this was a problem for the ancient hebrews for the simple reason that they did not consider god to be all-powerful or all-knowing.  the bible makes it quite clear throughout that god makes mistakes has regrets and doesn't know everything.  modern christians selectively ignore passages that make god look imperfect because it doesn't fit with the picture of god painted by modern christianity.  but the fact of the matter is that a plain reading of the bible particularly the older books makes it quite clear that ancient hebrews were under the impression that there were many gods but their god is the best of them.  Their God had limitations, and they knew it.  Why else would they lose in battle when God wanted them to win?  Why else would Eve be able to hide from God?  Why would God create a serpent that would go behind his back and convince his favorite creation to rebel against him?  Why else would he regret even making mankind to the point where he had to hit the reset switch?  And why does he have such a temper that he needed to create a rainbow to remind him not to destroy the planet again?  Well, at least not with water.  Yes, I am focusing on Christianity now because that is the religion that I am most familiar with.  But it's also the most paradoxical of the religions.  Islam allows for Allah to be malicious at times, which would explain why he didn't make everything clear to all people.  Hinduism portrays its gods as flawed beings like humans, but with more power.  Buddhism, when it has what might pass for gods, has its gods be people who have fully comprehended the Four Noble Truths and attained Buddhahood.  most religions throughout the ages judaism included did not claim that their god was all-powerful or all-knowing.  this is a fairly recent development and it doesn't seem to make sense.  i mean just think about it for a moment.  why are there so many christian denominations?  every single time a church splits into two or more denominations it is because they disagree about some doctrine or interpretation.  if this were not the case there would be no point in splitting off.  i mean one of the first major cases of the church splitting that is after it was consolidated from the disparate groups that formed its origin was caused by the disagreement between martin luther and the catholic church about the mechanisms of salvation and i'd just like to mention here that luther did use an argument against the church in his eighty six thesis that i think has never been adequately addressed.  why does the pope whose wealth to-day is greater than the wealth of the richest crassus build the basilica of st peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?  but that's a side issue here.  the real issue that i am interested in at the moment is the fact that god could have at any point stepped in and solved the dispute at any moment he could have appeared to the people involved and clarified salvation is by grace alone or salvation is by a combination of works.  and grace or salvation is by works alone or whatever other options there might be.  the existence of thousands of different christian denominations is at a minimum a demonstration that god does not want to communicate his desires for us in a clear manner.  more than likely though it is a demonstration that god does not exist.  now i can almost already hear the objections coming from the religious side that if god were to clearly and unambiguously reveal himself to us then we would lose our free will and god wants us to have free will so that's why he is silent most of the time.  unfortunately at least for christians this doesn't agree with the bible which claims in romans one twenty that god has clearly revealed himself to everyone.  so the word of god claims that god has revealed himself to everyone.  and yet even people who devote their entire lives to following god can't agree on doctrine that is laid out by the word of god.  the bible says that god is not the author of confusion and yet the bible is possibly the most confusing book in history.  no other book has caused so much confusion over seemingly minor issues like whether a drum set is considered godly or sinful.  seriously the church i went to as a kid once had a major split where we lost a good chunk of our congregation because the church bought a drum set and bible verses were thrown back and forth by both sides of the argument as a support for their position.  does god want his followers to engage in such pointless bickering?  could he not have come down and clarified his opinion on modern drums?  the people who didn't like it would still be free to leave the church for a church without a drum set.  but that kind of illustrates the issue here.  these kinds of splits are over preference.  if you prefer to have modern drums you can justify that with the bible.  if you prefer not to you can also justify that with the bible.  if god were to let us know in no uncertain terms whether or not drum sets are an approved music-making device you are still free to not listen to what he has said and to do what you want anyway.  him making his will known does not violate free will which the bible doesn't really say we have anyway.  and there's another split as some will say it does while others will agree that it doesn't.  It's funny, as I was working on this script, apologist Mike Winger tweeted out that he found it to be confidence-building when he realized that many objections to Christianity were based on misrepresentations of the Bible or Christian beliefs.  But my question here is, which Christianity?  There are thousands of denominations.  They all have fundamental disagreements on what the Bible says and what Christians believe.  is genesis literal?  some say yes.  others say no.  was the zombie horde invading jerusalem in matthew twenty seven a literal historical event?  some say yes.  others say no.  salvation by works by faith or by a combination of the two depends who you ask.  is hell eternal torture eternal separation from god or oblivion again depends who you ask was jesus actually the son of god?  most christians now would say yes but there are some who would say no and they still call themselves christian.  is the trinity a thing?  again?  most would say yes but there are still people who would say no.  i've even spoken to people who call themselves christian but don't believe in the resurrection.  every single aspect of christian doctrine is a matter of interpretation and there will be people on both sides who say that after prayerful study of the scriptures god revealed to them that they have the correct interpretation.  but the way i see it if god were truly all-powerful it would not be a matter of interpretation.  it would be crystal clear.  every single issue i bring up here will have christians on both sides of the matter debating with each other over what is really in the mind of the all-powerful creator of the universe.  Anyway, this video is just a long way of saying that if there is an all-powerful creator of the universe and he wanted to make it known what was on his mind, there wouldn't be a debate.  End of story.  Special thanks once again to Dr.  David Schneider, who sent me enough money to go out for dinner in an overpriced tourist-centered restaurant.  Thanks for watching.
