            "text": "Shalom, shalom.  This is L. Dyle from One Nation, One Power.  Coming back to you brothers and sisters one more time just to give an update.  You know, after we did that live today, we had a service.  And I couldn't wait to tell you guys because you guys are a part of this family.  We had a sister.  And for all you sisters out there, you are on the... You were on the Thursday night prayer line a couple of Thursdays ago with Sister Maria.  She speaks Spanish and she was praying in Spanish.  Well, she had her surgery on Monday and she had a tumor in her body the size of a watermelon.  This tumor was attached to her kidneys.  It was attached to her liver and her gallbladder.  She went into surgery Monday.  I'm giving this testimony to the best of my ability.  We're going to record her testimony and we're going to share it with all of you out there.  When she went into surgery, they opened her up from the top of her chest all the way down to the bottom of her belly to remove this tumor.  When surgery was done, the doctor told her that he was not the one that removed the tumor out of her body.  The doctor told her that he did not believe in God and in no God, but that her God showed up and removed the tumor that required no surgery to detach it from her kidney, her liver, or her gallbladder.  She had lost so much blood that they were waiting on her to die.  She didn't die.  Listen to me real good.  The next day, they took her blood work.  Her blood work came back as if she lost no blood.  The doctor, the same doctor that did not believe in no God, could not believe the results from the blood work and had them do it again.  They did it again a second time.  And when it came back the second time, it came back as if she didn't lose no blood.  The doctor looked at her and told her, hear me talking.  The doctor looked at her and told her that I don't believe in no God, but now I believe in your God.  Hear me talking.  The nurses that were in the room when the surgery was happening told her that a supernatural force was in the room.  I'm giving you guys this testimony, men and women, because here at One Nation, One Power, we put in work in the prayer closet.  And this is just one miracle that has happened over this week.  Another miracle, one of the brothers of the ministry had a clot in one of his arteries.  that should have caused a massive stroke.  When the blood clot happened, it cut off the blood to the brain.  He was like a statue.  He couldn't move.  He couldn't talk.  He couldn't walk.  He didn't know who he was or where he was at.  They rushed him to the hospital.  They did the blood work.  He came back.  The blood clot in his artery disappeared.  He was at service today with the sister.  And in three days, the sister was up and walking and out of the hospital and the hospital didn't want to release her after the fourth day.  The hospital came to the sister and said, with that type of surgery, you must be in some pain.  We got pain medication for you.  She said, I don't need no pain medication.  I don't have no pain in my body.  The hospital up here in the White Mountains of Arizona is mainly ran by a specific religion.  But I want to let them know today that the God who we serve here at One Nation, One Power is a height.  And his son's name is Yeshiva and the Ruach HaKadosh.  A week prior to her surgery, my wife and one of the ladies in the ministry laid hands where the tumor was and prayed for a miracle.  And I'm here today to let you guys know.  the Most High sent an angel into the operating room that removed the tumor.  And the doctor don't take no credit for the surgery, because he know he had nothing to do with it.  This is L. Daniel from One Nation, One Power, letting my brothers and my sisters out there know.  This is just another miracle and many miracles in this ministry.  So for all of you haters out there who think that because I'm married to somebody of another nation, that the Most High ain't working with us, I'm here today to let you know, just like the Pharisees said to the disciples, let this work alone.  Because if you continue to fight against it, you're going to find yourselves out there fighting against the Most High God Himself.  Shalom. ",
