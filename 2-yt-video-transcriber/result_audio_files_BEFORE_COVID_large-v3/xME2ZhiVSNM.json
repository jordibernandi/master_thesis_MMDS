What we wanted to basically do with this video is just kind of go over our first thoughts of not just the speech at the rally, but the event itself.

Maybe three hours before the rally starts.  And, dude, he's like one of the guys out there helping set up the barricades and the chairs.  Shout out to him.  Anyway, he was hanging out for a while, basically working as like the welcome wagon.  Whenever people walked into the park, hey, welcome, you're with the Yang Gang.  How did you hear about him?  What do you like about him?  So it started off, I was like, that's really cool, man.  Just the energy was really good.  He was introducing everyone.  So that's where the day started, right?  then i guess we'll get through and the thing i want to highlight.  i don't have time to highlight every cool person and thing we saw there but just it was a unique experience.  that was when we ran into b-boys.  positive too yeah we ran into the b-boys for yang and out of nowhere a circle form and it goes.  one guy starts break dancing and we go.  oh my god look at that guy's break dancing.  right now in the middle of this uh political rally as we're getting ready for the politician to go on stage which is cool enough right?

They were there doing it all day.  I mean, the amount of Yang gang coverage that descended to cover this event was crazy.  I mean, like I said, man, like, you look at this stuff, you look at a guy, you look at the pyro going off on his entrance, you look at this, you know, essentially a little mini rap concert, which is, you know... was the crowd was the atmosphere.  I could very easily see a rapper goes out or even just anyone who does that.  I guess rap is a pretty good example of this.  And you go up on stage and you're trying to work up a bunch of people to show up to a political rally.  And it just kind of being like, eh, like, eh, whatever.  But I mean, like, holy cow, man, you can see that crowd.  You can see, look at this, man.  The people are going, they are into it.  So then that was, that was the most surreal part.

We bumped into, I'm sure you guys know, the guy Adam behind the No Jumpers podcast.  Yeah.  He was there, I guess, doing his whole thing.  But again, my point being, the reason I bring it up is that this event was definitely something that... A lot of the big media was there to cover the political angle of it.  We saw a lot of, like, presidential candidates.  But even some people who were just kind of, like, from L.A.  And they're like, something's up here.  I mean, he obviously was gang gang.  You'll see in a few days we interviewed him.  I loved \u2013 he had the best answer ever.  He stole \u2013 he is the answer I'm going to steal now on what's Andrew Yang's best non-UBI policy, which I love.  But it was just really cool.  I mean \u2013 At one point, there's a woman we met.  She dressed up as a John Yang, went on stage, jumped into the crowd.  It was crowd surfing.  I mean, it was just a really wild day.  And the reason why I wanted to bring this up is because a big thing that we talk about here at Problems in Our Politics is, like I say, we don't only cover the campaign and what's going on with the election, but we kind of cover the Yang gang itself because there's something really unique and interesting happening here.  And like I said, going to this event, man, really was just another... I kind of had a feeling.  I remember the one we went to in April.  I'm like, the one we went to in April was pretty interesting.

He said in his speech that they, in the campaign, they think they could win California, which I guess if you're going to win the White House, you might have to.

It was a sight to behold.  So anyone who couldn't make it, you know, for many reasons, I'm sure most people don't live in Los Angeles, but still, these are some really cool events, and I just, I don't know.  I just couldn't.  I couldn't really believe at the end.  I'm like, wow, that was a political rally.  It really felt more like a celebration than a political rally by the end.  And there was huge turnout and then just tons of positivity.  That was our big takeaway from the event.  It was really something else.  I wish I had some negative stuff to throw in there to kind of spice it up, but not really.  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah. ",
