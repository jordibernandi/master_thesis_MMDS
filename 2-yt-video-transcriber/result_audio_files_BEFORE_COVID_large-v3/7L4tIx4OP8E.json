            "text": "Celebrity trainer Mazza Arias showing us how not to train an obese person with Tess Holliday.  My name's Allen Roberts.  This is Everyday M-Day Fitness.

And my opinion, of course, can be linked above and below at the end in all those places.  Thank you very much.  So this video was sent to me and it took me an extra .25 seconds to look at it because Tess Holliday has me blocked now.  How you doing, Tess?  So yeah, it was on her Instagram.  It took me like an extra 2.25 seconds to look at it.  Yes, baby.  And whoo!  That was so good.  Woo!  It is a video of her doing the agility ladder and sprinting, being trained by celebrity trainer, Mozzie Arias, who has 2.5 million followers on Instagram, her own supplement line, I think her own clothing line on Fabletics.  She's a highly successful trainer, highly successful.  I will say this though, any trainer that believes in healthy at every size, that says you can be healthy at every size, doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about, in my opinion, of course.  Is either lying or doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.  Just in my opinion, of course.  And YouTube, I did say in my opinion, of course, by the way.  So her and Tess Holliday link up three times a week from an article I read where Tess drives two hours each way to then do this type of workout.  Actually, the other ones I saw were very safe.  For some reason, this one, extremely fucking dangerous for an obese person.  Here's some facts, reality, physics, math, okay?  Statistically, factually, every time you run, there is anywhere from 9 to 13 times the amount of stress on your load-bearing joints from your body weight.  So if you are 200 pounds, your stress on your knees every time you jog, every time you take a jog, is somewhere around 1,800 pounds.  to, what is it, 2,600 pounds, okay?  That is just fact, it's reality, it's been measured, it has been studied.  ad nauseum, right?  There is anywhere from five to 10 times the amount of force of your body weight, the amount of stress on your body weight on your Achilles tendon.  So anywhere if you're a 200 pound person, that is anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 pounds.  fact.  It's just fact.  It's facts.  That's the thing.  The problem with the obesity acceptance movement is that they're trying to ignore facts.  You are not healthy if you're morbidly obese by gravity, literally by gravity, by the forces of you coming down on your load-bearing joints.  You are not healthy because this woman, in my professional opinion, Tess Holliday, is about 200 pounds overweight for her frame.  Your frame does not change.  And I saw a bunch of comments in her comment section about how it strengthens your bones.  There is not enough strength to strengthen her bones enough for this type of jogging.  There's not enough strength, there's not enough training that she's going to do from this.  There's no reward that is going to strengthen her joints to be able to take this type of load, this type of pressure ad nauseum.  Now here's the reality.  She drives four hours round trip three times a week to train with Mazzi Arias.  I personally believe, and I personally believe that this is just for the publicity.  It is just for the videos and clips.  It is just for whatever.  Because any real trainer that was concerned about their morbidly obese client would tell them, you know what?  Find a pool and walk in the pool for two hours three times a week and save yourself about two and a half extra hours.  And by the way, the wear and tear on your joints, which if... At some point in time, if she keeps up this type of training, Tess Holliday will most likely suffer an injury to her ankle, her lower back, or her knees.  Break a bone, do something, pop a tendon, do something, tear a ligament, do something like that.  And unfortunately, because I do not wish this upon anybody, this could cause her early demise.  She is morbidly obese.  She has a poor relationship with food.  She will eat more.  be less active, and put on more weight, then it could cause her death.  That is the fucking issue, people.  The issue is that these types of behaviors are very, very, very, very dangerous.  And she is, her and Mazzy Azzy, or Arius, or whatever her fucking name is, are showing these things to a huge audience of people.  If you look in the comments section of Tess's video clip of this, there are people asking, how do you keep working out and losing weight?  Because I want to work out, but I don't want to lose weight.  I love being big.  That is the problem.  That is where we have gotten to.  Where we have gotten to is that where people have shown this to be very healthy, perfectly fine behaviors, and it is not a marker on you as how you look.  Aesthetics are a matter of opinion.  It is not a matter of your morality.  Morality is how you act, not how you look.  But I will say it is highly immoral, in my opinion of course, for people to be stating that you can be healthy at every size and that training like this for a morbid obese person is in any way safe.  The problem right now is that many personal trainers are only concerned with aesthetics, looks, lifting, your goals.  The majority of the population, the majority of people that start training, that start working out, are not physically suited to be worried about how big their deadlift is.  They should not be worried about their time on an agility ladder.  They shouldn't.  They should not be worried about their sprinting time.  They should be worried about how much time they can get at very, very low impact, very, very safe, very, very, very, you know, best bang for your buck, so to speak, caloric expenditures, and seriously watch their nutrition so they can get to a healthy fucking weight.  Every fucking week I have to talk about this because it seems like nobody is.  Everybody's flaunting this like, oh she's a hero and blah blah blah.  This, first of all, she should not be doing this.  Mazzy Aries, if you're watching, I highly doubt you would.  You should know better.  You should know better.  Just by physics, you're endangering this woman.  You absolutely are.  Saying it was so great that she ran, oh, that was so much better, that is horrific.  That is negligent, in my opinion, of course.  I understand that people are going to be like, well, she's mad hilarious and you're fucking nobody.  You're just a bald dude that screams into a fucking camera.  But it doesn't matter how popular she is and who the fuck I am.  I've said this before.  Facts don't give a shit about where they're presented from.  They're just facts and it's reality.  The problem is you are endangering this woman.  In my opinion, of course.  You are.  You are absolutely putting Tess Holliday in danger because you could easily get her hurt.  When you're that big, when you are that overweight... You can step off a curb wrong and shatter bones.  Shatter bones.  Again, just as a quick reminder of the facts, anywhere from 9 to 13 times the amount of body weight the person has is the pressure that goes on their joints.  A person is designed, you can take look at this picture right here and you can see that the x-ray of an obese person still shows a actual normal sized frame.  Their frame does not all of a sudden get huge.  It stays normal.  It stays the same size.  Their frame doesn't get bigger.  Just the fat tissue around it and the adipose tissue and the visceral fat gets larger.  The fat around their organs gets bigger.  That is the issue.  The issue is this woman is too big to be doing these exercises and that is not a fat shame.  That is not an insult.  That is fact.  Let's get back to facts shall we?  because the problem the true problem is we're ignoring this and people like videos like this perpetuate the idea that they said that this is perfectly healthy and this woman that should be people should train like this.  the issue is that another 300 and some pound woman who's five three will try to do this because you need to remember you're speaking to the dumbest person in your audience.  They'll try to do this and shatter their knees or fuck up their ankles and then they'll gain more weight and then guess what?  Then they're immobile and then they're morbidly obese immobile and then it leads to their early demise.  It just does.  Dear fitness community, including Mazniaris and everybody else, and especially you motherfuckers that believe in healthy in every size, because any trainer, again, that believes in healthy in every size, you don't know what the fuck you're doing, in my opinion.  You don't.  This is an issue.  Let's get back to actual reality of training people and getting people fit.  And that's just my two cents on the matter.  My name's Alan Roberts.
