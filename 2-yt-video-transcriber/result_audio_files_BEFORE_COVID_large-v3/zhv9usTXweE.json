            "text": "But we must travel the desert.  In the desert, where there are no clouds, to give forth water.  Where there is no water, there is no herbage, no vegetation.  Then the earth becomes like granulated stone.  So it is with black people in America.  Even though we have clouds above our head and we have beautiful green fields in America it is hot and dry of the water of divine life for the poor people of Almighty God who have been brought out of the East on a westerly course and brought into North America hit in the head and bury it in the north corner.  Is that right?  In a shallow grave where there is no light.  Now if the east represents the light because it's the place of the rising of the sun, the west represents darkness because it is the place of the setting of the sun.  Is that right?  Now if we were carried out of the east And we didn't come on the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria.  Nor did we come on the Mayflower.  Our fathers were brought here in the holds of ships.  Is that right?  We met some ruffians.  Don't tell me they weren't rough.  They were rough, rough, and tough.  For they robbed us of our raiment.  They hit us in the head and they took away from us our names.  Beautiful names.  Names of the living God.  Why names of God?  Because you are the divine people of God.  You dress in the garment of queens.  You dress in the garment of kings.  You adorn your head with wisdom.  Why?  Because you are the people of Almighty God.  And you should walk proudly like kings and queens, not in a symbolic way, but in a very real way.  All praise is due to Allah.  Everybody all right?  Let's go down a little deeper.  Now, beloved... losing names that connect us to God.  We take on the names of our slave master as it is written in the book of Daniel.  Daniel says that there were certain men that were seen in the East that were skilled in wisdom and mathematics and they could stand in the presence of the king.  They had names, Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah, Mishael, is that right?  And Daniel.  They were brought out of their own place and brought into Babylon.  Babylon, as you know, was an ancient city of confusion and deep corruption.  And wherever you have confusion, there's darkness.  And wherever you have corruption, there is darkness.  So coming from Jerusalem to Babylon, they came to a city of darkness and corruption.  Is that right?  The richest city of that day.  But the wicked king wanted to change their names.  Wanted to change their learning.  Is that right?  And change their tongue and give them to eat a portion of the king's meat, a kind of meat that they never ate when they were at home among their own people worshiping their own God.  I'm sorry, but it's the truth.  And so the king changed their name to Shadrach.  Meshach and Abednego.  Is that right?  Now do you think that the Caucasian people went to Africa to get people who were swinging in trees?  How could people who swang in trees build their cities, build their towns, teach them how to cook, sew for them, build their mansions.  It seems to me they got a mason.  It seems to me they got hold of a builder.  It seems to me they got hold of a daughter of a mystic shrine.  It seems to me they got hold of a star out of the east.  And they wanted to bring these children of the Most High God into a state of degradation so that they could mock God by mocking the people of Almighty God.  Now you read of Daniel looking backward, but what's the sense of reading Daniel looking backward when the Bible is a living book?  It is a book of yesterday to teach us all about today.  Because if the Bible is only about yesterday and not good for today, then we don't need it.  But all of you that are good Christians, you know the Bible is a relevant book.  And if the Bible is a relevant book, then what happened in Daniel's day is pointing to what's happening in 1983.  Is that right?  Now where do you find people that lost their name?  That lost their language?  That have taken on a different learning and are eating a strange meat?  Here they are.  Right here in the Western Hemisphere.  There they are.  Mrs.  Whitehead.  Think about a name like that.  Mrs.  Whitehead.  Suddenly your hair will grow white if you live long enough.  But that's not a name of God.  Mr.  Wolf.  That's awful.  For us to be named after the creatures when we are the children of the creator.  Isn't that something?  They gave us names.  Mr.  Bunch.  Mr.  Talley.  Mr.  Woodcutter.  Mr.  Fish, Mr.  Hogg, Mr.  and Mrs.  Roundtree.  How come we are not in the culture of the wisdom that you have on your head?  The wisdom that you have on your head is the wisdom of your father.  It's not a strange thing to you.  You're not a Muslim son.  Even though you're in the highest lodge or the highest degree, you are yet not a Muslim son.  You are the father himself.  You didn't hear me.  I'm going to say it again.  You're not the son.  You are really the father.  And Caucasian people who are in the Scottish Rites, they know who you are.  Caucasian people who are Shriners and Masons, they know more about you, unfortunately, than you know about yourself, and that's why they continue to rule.  No man... Are you listening?  I hope you're listening.  Because look, if you got an equal degree to the other Caucasians who have an equal degree of this high wisdom, how come you don't rule equally?  Can a man of superior wisdom be ruled by a man of inferior wisdom?  then if we are continuing under the yoke of our oppressor, and we have degrees of knowledge equal to what he has, and yet he rules us, then there's something that he knows about us that we don't know about ourself, and that is why they don't want you to integrate the large.  You keep this separate.  You didn't hear me.  You did not hear Brother Farrakhan.  You integrate the schools.  You integrate the toilets.  You integrate hotels and motels.  But when it comes to banks, when it comes to Wall Street, when it comes to big bucks, When it comes to this brother's business, you stay in your place.  And when it comes to the ancient order of the nobles of the mystic shrine, you got yours and I got mine.  And I'll say what I say in mine and give you the same handshake, the same signal, and you swear we're brothers, but I'll end up ruling you with a black tassel on your head.  Mine is tied down and yours is tied down, but it seems you've got more freedom of movement with your tassel than I've got with mine.  Something is wrong somewhere, beloved.  And what I want to say to you tonight, as your brother-in-law and your brother-in-love, that we need to stop pursuing the symbol and stop pursuing the reality.  And the reality is behind the sign and behind the symbol in the desert.  In the desert, there is no cloud.  What makes the cloud?  The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said it is the sun and the moon drawing the water up from the earth.  in a fine mist that the naked eye can hardly detect.  and as this mist forms a cloud winds carry that cloud over a dry dead earth.  and then the cloud breaks and the water falls.  and then coming up from the earth you have vegetation.  in the desert there are not those water clouds and so generally the desert does not bloom.  we are in a dry place and the people with whom we come in contact are just like that granulated stone hard people.  you know you walk on sand.  it feels easy to your feet but when somebody takes sand and rubs it on your skin with no water in it it'll take your skin off.  the way we live in America We are walking among hard-hearted people, stiff-necked and rebellious people to the way of God.  Listen, beloved.  You're in a desert and you're seeking life and water and light in the desert.  Now, when they brought our fathers into America, They hit us in the head.  Is that right?  You can tell we've been hit in the head.  You don't have to be no scholar or scientist to look at black folk and say, somebody hit those people.  Dear beloved pastors, when we preach the Good Samaritan, look at how Jesus described us.  A certain man was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho.  Jerusalem is a city.  That means that the name Jerusalem means founded in peace.  Jericho, again, was a city of confusion.  Anything that has peace in it and harmony and brotherhood, the light of God is present.  When you find confusion and darkness, the light of God is absent.  Here's a man traveling, and the book says he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho.  Because when you go from peace to confusion, you're not going up, you're going down.  When we left home, back home, where these phases symbolize you left peace and you stepped down, yes, into a Rolls Royce, down, yes, into a Cadillac, down into a Mercedes Benz.  down into a $100,000 home.  But what is it if you're a nigger in a Rolls Royce?  No respect in a Rolls Royce.  No production in a Rolls Royce.  Then you just a nigger with a Rolls Royce and the white man made the Rolls Royce.  You buy it from him.  You buy the gas from him.  You buy the clothes from him.  You buy the diamonds from him.  What are you producing for yourself?  Nothing.  Why?  Because you don't really have the light.  You are still groping in the darkness and you need the light.  Beloved, I'm not knocking.  These are good things to have.  I love them too.  But I don't want to have them in ignorance.  I want to have them and know their purpose.  I am a child of the divine supreme being.  And I deserve the best that is in his creation.  Why shouldn't I have the best when I've suffered the worst?  I'm deserving of the best, but I must deserve the best with light.  Knowing the purpose of things knowing the place of things and never taking things and making things.  God Did you hear me? ",
