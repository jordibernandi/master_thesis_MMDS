            "text": "Now, Ben Shapiro, for those of you who aren't familiar, is supposed to be the smartest man on the right wing.  This is the young firebrand, the brilliant debater, the smart man who can just dissect any left-wing view, any leftist critique of capitalism, any socialist viewpoint.  He can just rip it to shreds.  He is the intellectual vanguard of the new young right wing.  Ben Shapiro, just a superstar on Fox News, just considered to be the smartest man ever, right?  So he's speaking and someone gets up and asks him, what do you say in response to socialists?  And he gives what he presents as the most brilliant, the most brilliant argument against socialism.  Let's listen to what Ben Shapiro says. ",

            "text": "So here is the actual argument that works with socialism.  It is immoral to steal from people even if you vote to steal from people.  Okay, if there are three people in a room, it's me, and I have a hundred bucks, and you and your friend are in the room, and you vote to beat me up and take my money, that does not make it morally legitimate for you to beat me up and take my money.  The left always argues on the moral level.  In the end, they always say, sure, my ideas don't work, but they're fair.  They're fair, right?  And so what you have to say, the only way to come back from that is to say, no, your ideas are not fair, your ideas are theft. ",

            "text": "That's an interesting way of putting things, Ben.  But there's a little bit of a problem with that.  That's not an argument against socialism.  That's an argument against taxation.  every government in the entire world has forcibly redistributed wealth to some degree or other.  I'm walking, as you can see, on sidewalks.  These sidewalks were paid for and built with wealth that was redistributed from me to the government, which then used it to build these sidewalks.  So is the USA socialist?  You know, Benjamin Franklin, the founder, one of the co-founders, founding fathers of the United States, said that there are only two things certain in life, death and taxes.  So I guess Benjamin Franklin was a socialist.  This is not an argument against socialism.  Every government that has ever existed has redistributed wealth to some degree or other.  It's just a matter of how much, right?  Some governments redistribute lots of wealth.  Some governments redistribute very little.  Some redistribute to the rich with, you know, you know, government subsidies for corporations and corporate welfare.  Some have lots of social programs.  But the issue of should the government tax people in order to spend their money, that has nothing to do with the debate between socialism and capitalism.  And according to Ben Shapiro, all taxation is immoral.  So we should just have anarchy.  So any government that taxes is socialism.  This is an absurd argument.  I really don't think that we should not levy taxes against people.  I don't know any country in the history of humanity that has done that.  So his brilliant argument against socialism, well, the government can't forcibly take things from you, doesn't really add up.  However, let's look at the question the student asked, because that'll give you some insight. ",

Is there any way to really get around that and try to make them see that, look, just because your version of socialism, that magical fantasyland version of socialism, has not been tried, doesn't mean that socialism is an acceptable concept.

            "text": "Yes.  The problem is that you're arguing with them in terms of the effectiveness of socialism.  So that argument is you say socialism doesn't work, it fails everywhere, it makes people poor and miserable, right?  That's the argument.  And then they go, but that's because it hasn't been properly tried.  That's their comeback.  The problem for conservatives is we never actually argue on a moral level.  We're constantly arguing on an effective level, on an efficiency level.  And that's a problem. ",

            "text": "So the student is basically softballing Ben Shapiro and trying to get Ben Shapiro to rip on.  the fact that so many socialists are ignorant about the history of socialism, don't want to admit that the Soviet Union was the first country in outer space, that China used to be one of the poorest countries in the world, and with socialist central planning and a planned economy has become a global superpower.  Sure, it's easy to knock down.  It's very easy to knock down the, oh, that's not real socialism argument.  Socialism is not taxation.  Socialism is when the banks, factories, and industries and the major centers of economic power operate in the interest of all of society, not in the interest of a small group of owners.  It's when the economy is forced to serve the people.  It's when the means of production operate according to public good and are centrally planned and don't operate simply according to the anarchy of production, the chaos of profits, chaos of the market.  That's the difference between capitalism and socialism.  And it was socialism that defeated Adolf Hitler during the Second World War.  It was socialism that invented the first mobile phone.  It was socialism that invented LED lights.  It was socialism that invented the AK-47 rifle.  It is socialism that took Russia from being a backward agrarian society to being a fully industrialized modern country.  It was socialism that has made China the second largest economy in the world.  Meanwhile, unregulated capitalism is failing all across the planet.  You want to see the wonders of the free market?  Go to Haiti, go to Nigeria, go to Guatemala, go to Honduras, right?  Unregulated free market capitalism is destroying countries across the planet.  Libya was once the country in Africa with the highest life expectancy.  It had an Islamic socialist government led by Muammar Gaddafi.  Now, Libya has joined the global free market system and things are so bad, people are getting on rafts and fleeing and drowning in the Mediterranean trying to get out.  If you go all across the planet, you can see the results of the free market system, the IMF and the World Bank, neoliberalism and privatizations being imposed on people.  Free markets destroy countries, and free markets have even destroyed our own country here in the United States.  Look at Michigan.  Look at Ohio.  Look at Pennsylvania.  The conditions people are living in have gone down.  Why?  Because for decades in the United States, we have embraced Ben Shapiro's philosophy.  Get the government off our backs.  Privatize everything.  Lower taxes on the rich.  And the result has been gutting the standard of living in the United States and strengthening the globalist free market international bankers.  Capitalism today is the rule of Wall Street banking corporations, London stock market, the rule of big international giant corporations and bankers that have no loyalty to the United States or any other country.  Right?  And socialism is when a country breaks out of that system and says, we want to control our economy.  We are going to have an economy that serves the people, not the interests of profits.  That's what socialism is, and socialism has been successful. ",
