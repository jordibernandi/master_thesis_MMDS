Good God.  Coolies, come on in.  Sunshine, come on down.  You'll have the teardrops on the ground.  The sun is coming down.  All I'm saying is sometimes I'm more scared of myself.  You better.  I say.  Run away.  Run away.  Run, children.  Run for your life.  Run away.  Run away.  Run, children.  Oh, here it comes.  Say run.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah, I'm on the run.  See where I'm coming from.  Will you see me coming along?  Will you see where I'm running from?  No time for question asking.  Time is passing by.  All right.  You can't win, child.  We've all tried to.  You've been lied to.
