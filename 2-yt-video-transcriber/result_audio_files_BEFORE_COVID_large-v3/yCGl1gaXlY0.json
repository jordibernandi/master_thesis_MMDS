So thank you guys for listening and enjoy the video for today.  hi guys welcome back to my channel so I wanted to make a little I guess rambling stream of consciousness video kind of some more similar to my older videos today.  there's been a lot on my mind I guess as the year is coming to an end and I feel very reflective.  I feel very sort of in my own mind, just thinking about how far I've come over the past three years and how big of a role YouTube has played in this transformation that I've experienced.  And I guess, I mean, I really just want to start off by saying thank you.  Thank you to the people, first of all, who've been with me here on this journey with me for this long.  You know, from the beginning, some of you will remember my original videos, the ones which have been since removed from my channel before I came back.  For those of you who do remember those original videos, you know that I was not in a good place, really, when I started my YouTube channel.  I was lost.  I was confused.  I was unhappy.  I was desperately searching for order in my life.  And not just order, but the thing which happens inside of us that compels us to create order, you know, because there is something that was turned on inside of me, inside my heart and inside my soul, which propelled me forward in a really productive way.  that, I mean, I just, before I started going down the red pill path, whatever you want to call it, Opening my mind up to new ideas and to new sort of people and their ideas.  It wasn't a superficial change where I had to kind of say to myself, okay, you have to do this because it's good for you.  Or this is what's best for you, so you just need to slug through it.  It wasn't like that.  There was an effortlessness to... my transformation, um, from darkness to light.  That's really how it, how it feels.  I feel like I was living my life in darkness and even just being shown the light in other people who had already found it.  Um, it lit a fire inside me and it it's yielded a life that I didn't know that I was capable of achieving.  in a really big way.  And so for people who are watching this right now who think, you know, I'm not where I want to be in my life.  How do I build a life that I can be happy with or I can be proud of too?  For me, it was like, it was a bumpy road.  There were some very scary periods and phases of this transformation because I had to let the life that I was living and the identity that I had die and crumble.  before I could start building again.  And that was the hardest part for me, you know, like being red pilled or being brought back to Christ or rediscovering how to be honest with myself, like brutally honest with myself and honest with other people about what I believe, even if I'm wrong.  And I've been wrong many times throughout this process.  But like the devotion to honesty and to finding what's divine about that, It exposed the lie that I was living.  It exposed how fake I was, how I had been lying to myself for years, years and years and years about what I wanted, about my own happiness, about being satisfied with the situation that I was in.  Just kind of pure apathy.  When I started to be honest with myself again, it was like my heart opened up and I felt excited about things for the first time in forever.  I found parts of myself that I thought I had lost, you know.  Um, a kind of enthusiasm for life that I felt at the time.  Maybe I didn't feel it anymore because I was getting older and that enthusiasm for life, that sort of motivation to go get what I wanted was just a part of my youth.  And now that I was older, I had lost it and I couldn't get it anymore.  That wasn't true.  But I quickly realized that if I really wanted to build something I had to start over from scratch.  And that meant moving to a new country.  It meant moving back in with my parents for a short amount of time.  It meant ending a six year long relationship.  It meant quitting jobs that I had been doing for three years.  I literally had to go back to square one.  And that's why I got off the internet during that time because it was very traumatic.  It was very scary and very painful.  know and i didn't i didn't want to be online in that state.  i think that's somewhat understandable.  but um i had to hand it over to god.  i had to hand it over to our lord um and by it i mean my life.  i had to hand over my life to him.  i had to surrender that.  i had been believing false things i had been telling myself lies and I had turned away from Christ.  I had turned away from God and the truth.  I no longer was living a life of any respectability.  And it was then that, it was really then that I was able to rebuild after I admitted that and after I had brought myself back down to square one.  And then, you know, I met my husband and I guess the rest is kind of history, a little bit.  There are things I wish that I could share with you guys, but for my own privacy and the privacy of the people in my life that I love, I feel hesitant to talk in detail about.  But maybe in the future when things are a little bit, my current situation is a little bit different, these are things that I can share with you.  But, you know, within three years I went from being very unhappy pretty much every dimension of my life to now being where I want to be in the world doing what I want to do in love married and pregnant which you can see my bump right here.  it's getting bigger by the day.  I feel very blessed and I don't think that I would have achieved these things had I not Allowed things to fall apart, you know, things that I had been holding together for way too long.  Things that I had to lie to myself about in order to live with.  And so this journey online of being vulnerable and talking about the things that are important to me and sharing all of this with you from exposing sort of the political lies of our time to pushing back against the cultural degeneration that we see all around us to rediscovering femininity and pushing back against the oppressive nature of feminism in pursuit of finding true womanhood, which I feel like now I have much better grasp on than I ever did in a feminist critical theory course at university.  And now walking down this new path as a new wife and a soon to be mom.  It is not, like this path now is not without its struggle.  I've only been married for like six or seven months and like marriage is hard.  It's not easy.  There are times when I feel like I'm really not living up to what my husband deserves.  And it's something, you know, our relationship as a married couple who are soon going to be parents is something that we're working on all the time.  It's not easy.  And I think as a modern woman, who is influenced by modernity and who has been influenced by feminism, learning to be submissive, learning to respect my husband's authority, learning how to take on my role as a housemaker and a supportive role in my husband's life.  It's been a challenge, but it's something that I think I'm getting better at every day, and I hope I continue to get better at it.  So yeah, I guess in conclusion here, I just want to say thank you to everyone who has been along this journey with me and has supported me and been kind and offered words of wisdom.  The first step is admitting to yourself that you've probably failed in some area.  If you find yourself in a situation or circumstance that you're not happy with, you have to take responsibility for what you have done to land yourself there.  If you can't take the responsibility for yourself as to why you're unhappy is why you're living a life that isn't what you want, then you're never gonna be able to take the first step to dismantling that life that you're not happy living and laying the foundation for something that you can build that is worth fighting for and that makes you happy.  So I think this is within everyone's grasp.  You know, you just have to be patient.  You have to be honest with yourself.  And I think you really have to learn how to surrender a little bit.  You know, we live in a world where boomerism has really pushed us to believe that we need security in all of these areas.  We need, you know, we can't send our family until we have money.  We can't, you know, we can't do this thing.  that's a risk because there's uncertainty involved, right?  It's safer to stay in the life that I don't like than it would be to take a risk on the uncertainty of building a new life.  have to learn how to surrender.  you have to learn how to hand it over to god and trust that he will provide for you.  if you are willing to do the work of being honest with yourself and those around you in in your life and i think being honest is just it's one of the easiest things that you can do.  you can catch yourself um all the time you know having to ask yourself is this really true?  am i being honest with myself?  am i lying right now?  um And every time you catch yourself and you course correct, I think you get more along the path to finding not just truth and God in your life, but actual fulfillment.  You know, an actual sense of pride and respect for yourself and for the life that you might be living.  So thank you for listening to this little ramble.
