            "text": "Last Thursday, the New York Times published a cartoon that CNN's Jake Tapper said could easily have come from neo-Nazi or ISIS propaganda.  Two days later, a 19-year-old man carried out a mass shooting at a San Diego synagogue, leaving one dead and injuring several others, including children.  The New York Times cartoon didn't cause this shooting, but Barry Weiss, who writes for the New York Times, said, Antisemitism is a virus.  When the immune system of a society is healthy, antisemitism is kept in check.  When it is weakened, as it is now, the virus thrives.  In our weakened society, some mainstream media and even some mainstream politicians believe that as long as they make some link to Israel, no matter how tenuous, they can engage in the most vile anti-Semitism with impunity, claiming that it's criticism of Israel.  It is not.  Antisemitism is not like an abstract painting that means whatever you want it to mean.  There is an actual definition.  It's been adopted by many governments, including the United States.  Our petition to convince the media to adopt the international definition of antisemitism has already gained thousands of signatures.  And today, we ask you to join us.  The link is in the description.  Because hatred against any of us endangers all of us. ",
