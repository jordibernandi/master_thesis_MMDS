            "text": "Hey man, this intro.  I stumbled across some tweet from Joy Childs about Zendaya being MJ, and I'm like, uh-oh, here we go again.  I've already discussed this, but I'll say it again.  Anybody that supports race bending of comic book characters is a loser.  It's one of the most unnecessary things.  that seems, I don't know, many producers are doing right now in both tv and film a depiction of comic book characters.  this is nothing but a joke of a concept done by the production companies to appease you chumps that foam at the mouth over the concept of diversity and representation.  granted this is almost exclusively done to classically white characters, but the fact that folks actually champion these actions is sort of laughable.  And then when we say, let's say the character in the recent Spider-Man movies is only MJ in name, which she literally is, these clowns have the nerve to claim that people are racist.  Imagine having your head so far up your ass that you think that someone wanting to see a character be depicted by the same sort of white redhead person that she's been is somehow racist.  These fools have no connection to the source material, so leave it to these normies.  They'll change every character they can to someone that's non-white.  Of course, if Black Panther was portrayed by Whitey McWhiteface, everybody would be up in arms, including me.  The whole, oh, it's just a fictional character line will be immediately retired.  These clowns try to move the goalposts and say, well, that's different.  He's from Africa.  Yet they didn't have the same energy having those black ass guardians, which are based off the whitest thing I can think of, Norse mythology.  In fact, they snapping your ass slay queen over Tessa Thompson, just like they're doing with Zendaya.  Just like they did with Candace Patton being Iris West.  And the list goes on.  Consistency has never been their strong point.  The funny thing about all of this is that they're too stupid to recognize that they're being insulted.  Instead of the classically black characters being developed, they instead tokenize the classically white characters and give you the sloppy seconds.  And you consider that a victory.  A victory when they gave you a character that they put through the grinder for decades, unlike they do for some of the other black characters.  And because you have no connection to the source material and you're a... and Normie, you don't say anything when they crap on the legacy of classic and original black characters like Monica Rambeau for the sake of boosting up a white tokenized version of Marville, that is Carol Danvers, AKA the current Captain Marvel.  Again, you're too stupid to realize that you're being insulted.  The producers recognize that all it takes for you to be appeased is just to really dangle race in front of your face and you'll eat it up.  These fools really think that they're sticking it to the white folks by praising their tokenized characters.  And they'll move that goalpost again 99 times if it means trying to be right.  Who cares about race?  It's just a fictional character.  Wait, it wouldn't make sense to make Black Panther white.  Why not?  Why can't Black Panther be some white guy from South Africa?  It's just a fictional character, remember?  It's just a different universe.  No, it'd be stupid if they did it to Black Panther just like it's stupid for them to do it to these other characters.  We see them in the comics, bro.  We know how they look.  It is not a difficult thing to try to cast someone that looks like the character, and it's nothing to develop the black characters that already exist.  And if they don't catch on like some of the white characters that haven't caught on in the past, oh well, go back to the drawing board and create a new one just like they've done with the white characters.  and give it another shot.  Cry to yo mama about representation and diversity, which is just a buzz term way of saying that they want less white people, more specifically white men.  See what they did to Mar-Vell.  And all of this is based, of course, on comic books that they don't even read, and they just found out about Tuesday when the damn movie was announced.  Now they think they're just pissing off white people because folks dared to say that they take issue with a classically white character having their race changed.  And though this is almost exclusively done to white characters, they'll tokenize them while still messing up the black ones like they did with Storm and Monica Rambeau.  And I got a lot of for saying what I said about Storm.  Storm is yet to be depicted as a dark skinned black person who is of African American and Kenyan descent.  They instead get these mixed chicks who are just as much white as they are black.  Monica Rambeau also lighter skin, gets infantilized to be made to look up to a character who is only five years separated from obtaining their powers in the comics.  Monica never ever looked up to Mar-Vell or Carol Danvers, but now considers her an aunt and a father is oddly missing from the movie presenting this stereotypical single black mother.  So now two original females with superpowers are fucked.  Yet I'm supposed to somehow be proud as a black man because some biracial chick fills a role as a tokenized MJ.  Get the hell out of my face.  You continue to fall for the bone of tokenism in the name of diversity while continuing to perpetuate this nonsensical idea that people can only enjoy or relate to characters that are the same skin tone or gender as them.  Therefore, you must screw up the depiction of the characters.  Such a lousy ass excuse.  It's not too much to ask, nor is it racist to ask that characters be made to look like they've always looked in a comic book.  Keep Blade black, keep Fantastic Four white, keep Luke Cage a dark-skinned brother, and keep MJ and the love ventures of Spider-Man as a red-haired white woman.  And if anybody takes issue with that, tell them to go themselves and read a comic book.  Tokenizing characters is such an unnecessary thing, when there's a pool of characters to choose from, a big-ass pool in the case of Marvel, and a big-ass pool of actors and actresses to depict them.  And cornballs like Joy Childs and others should be called out for their stupidity for claiming racism because someone thinks that a race swap of a classic character is stupid.  And don't give me that crap, it's not a big deal.  If it wasn't a big deal, you wouldn't be snapping and clapping at the sight of every tokenized character and there would serve no purpose to change the damn race in the first place.  It's this gimmick that Hollywood elites try to perpetuate as they think they own your damn children.  Think about all the little black girls that will be inspired and see themselves because MJ got tokenized.  If that's the message you're instilling in your kids, you're a fucked up parent.  who the hell gave these hollywood clowns the righteousness to believe that kids need to see their elitist asses in order to be inspired?  you fools literally get paid to beat people that you're really not.  that's what acting is getting paid to be someone other than yourself.  so take your diversity and representation efforts and going on somewhere.  Just keep the white characters white, keep the black characters black, and if there is a movie that has more or less of the other, then oh the hell well.  But tokenizing characters will forever be whack, and I don't care what these elites say when they gloat and massage each other's egos at these award shows.  And don't think I'm going to be inconsistent when it comes to Nick Fury.  He's a tokenized character too.  Some tokenized characters work out more than others.  They're still tokenized and unoriginal.  They took his nuts anyway in Captain Marvel.  And though I may have ragged on the actors, make no mistake, I get it.  Just because they fill a role of a tokenized character does not mean that they can't act.  Just means that they might not look like the character.  Hell, in MJ's case, she don't look or act like a damn MJ.  So thank God they haven't called her Mary Jane Watson.  These fools are just doing what they can to advance their careers and most of them don't read damn comics anyway and probably didn't know of the character until they were cast for the role of Tried Out.  The whole representation thing is just a bone that they throw to the audience who will of course eat it up to divert from the fact that they got the sloppy seconds of these white folks. ",
