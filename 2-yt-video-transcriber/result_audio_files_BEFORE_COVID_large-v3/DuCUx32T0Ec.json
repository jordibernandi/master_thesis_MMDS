Because one of the things that I think happens now is... we have these titles and these labels on people.  You know, I'm a vegan, I'm a this, I'm a this, I'm a this.  And sometimes even on social media, I watch people judge, even food shame, diet shame people in terms of what they eat and what they don't.  Those who have the knowledge make fun of people who don't.  Those who, you know, how can you eat that?  I never found it to be an effective way to move people.  But whenever I watch Dr.  Sebi teach, I never saw him do that.  I never saw him judge people.  I never saw him make people feel like something was wrong with them because they weren't where he may have thought they could be.  Not even should, but could be in terms of their health.  I mean, how important was it for him to guide people in that way? ",

Because I noticed in our culture, and you just said this, we can obtain knowledge or know something more than someone else, and we feel like we're better than them.  And it's only knowledge.  We supposed to share knowledge.  So my grandfather never put a label on us and said, we're vegan, you're alkaline, you're this and that.  And you brought something up.  On social media, people are very judgmental.  And it shouldn't be about that.  This is about love.  It's about sharing information.  And that's all my grandfather did. ",

And so can you talk to me a little bit about what the process looks like to kind of get there?  Because it almost feels like it's so ingrained in our DNA to eat chicken and fish and all these things that it feels almost like unattainable.  So what do you say to people who aren't necessarily like, they don't even fathom, we don't even fathom that we can abstain and maintain a lifestyle like this. ",

Sebi was loved and supported and fed by women.  And that's one thing we used to talk about a lot.  is his love for women.  So I tell you that some of your experience... ",
