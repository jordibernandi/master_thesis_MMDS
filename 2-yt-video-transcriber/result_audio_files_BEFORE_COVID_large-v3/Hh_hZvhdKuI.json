No.  That's the correct response to have to that.  But it's a very gotcha question, because if he says... no, it's not possible, then that's not a true statement, right?

He wants to get the impeachment on and that's really fighting against Trump.  it would mean saying Nancy Pelosi's strategy is wrong.

Doesn't that mean you have to give up your policy positions and your progressive ideas?  Because everyone knows you have to be a milquetoast centrist with no platform and no ideas about governance in order to win.  You need to campaign on not doing anything and telling everyone why we can't do anything.  That's not a strategy that works.  I think we should know that by now.  The fact that the mainstream media continues to run with that as a line of like, hey, you need to tack toward the center and play fair with big business.  It's like, hey, it's not the neoliberal era anymore.  Just put that away.  Ultimately, I think Bernie could have gone with an answer where he points out the fact that he beats Trump repeatedly in every head-to-head poll and has done so over the last five years consistently, every single one, 100%.  That's a data point that goes to the electability question.  very well.  But nonetheless, I think Bernie handled the question well. ",

The Democrats got the House back, but they did it by running more centrist campaigns.  They flipped districts.  I mean, so so a lot of Democrats are saying it's more complicated than that.  OK. ",

And that 2018 election, we saw a huge increase in the number of young people who were participating, which is exactly what we have to do.  Look, what the American people understand is that the middle class is stagnant right now.  People are working longer hours for low wages.  They can't afford prescription drugs.  They can't afford to send their kids to college.  Meanwhile, the people on top are doing phenomenally well.  The American people, in my view, want a government and an economy that represents all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors.  That's why I believe we're going to win. ",

            "text": "All right.  Oh, only one of the candidates that you endorsed who happened to be in a swing state that we declared that could have been flipped from red to blue won.  So you're not endorsing the right people.  You don't have the right strategy.  I mean, we ended up with a blue wave, right?  But your idea was wrong.  So he endorsed people that won from blue seats.  right, that took away from those centrist, corporatist Democrats.  That's a big win for progressives.  That's a win for Bernie Sanders-style politicians, right?  AOC was among those, right?  Let's not talk about that, though.  Let's talk about, oh, only the districts that could have been flipped red to blue.  And let's also leave out the fact that polling on progressive candidates underrepresented how well they did in the actual uh... elections like progressive candidates.  so you're our revolution brand new congress justice democrats progressive don't take money from corporations.  style candidates in the twenty eighteen midterm outpaced their polling right.  they performed better in the election than their polling suggested now.  in some of those situations it did not result in a win.  when you have overwhelmingly red states occasionally that's not a thing that can happen.  but A thing that's worth pointing out is, look, all of the centrist Democrats that ran, even those that won, did not perform as well in the actual vote as they did in the polling.  The polling appears to be skewed in their favor.  All of these Justice Democrats, brand new Congress, our revolution, don't take corporate money, progressive candidates outperformed what the polling said.  even the ones that didn't end up winning their actual race, they came a lot closer than the polling indicated.  I think that's a tact that Bernie could have pointed out.  And I think he did well there, at least in pointing out that we're chipping away at it and we're making the types of progressive change that we really need.  Ultimately, this type of interview did not surprise me.  So Bernie's in this position now where he's in the top four, right?  He is unignorable.  They were hoping he would be ignorable by this point, but he is unignorable.  And so he's having to go on.  mainstream news outlets, particularly news light like the Today Show, has to have Bernie on, have to interview him.  And so what are they going to do if they can't ignore him?  Well, they're going to smear him.  And so that's what we saw here.  Every single one of these questions was a gotcha.  Every single one of them, there was no easy answer.  There was no, OK, if I just say yes or no, then that will, you know, show people where I am.  They'll show people what my position is.  No, instead, Bernie has to Take a step back, inform the viewer that the framing of the question is completely BS, and then kind of put the building blocks back in place.  about what are we trying to fight for?  How is this campaign going to win?  What are the important things in this country?  We're going to see more of this.  I'm expecting to see more of this.  So stay tuned, and I will cover it.  We'll see you all later.  Yeah. ",
