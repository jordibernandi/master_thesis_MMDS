            "text": "The Book of Sirach Prologue.  Many great truths have been given to us through Moses' teachings, the prophets, and the writers who follow them.  We should praise Israel for the instruction and wisdom its writers have provided.  Now, those who read the scriptures must not keep their knowledge of them to themselves.  But as people who love to learn, they must help others learn these scriptures through the spoken and written word.  Because my grandfather, Yeshua ben Sirach, had devoted himself to reading Moses' teachings, the prophets, and the other books from our ancestors, he became an expert in them.  This led him to write about the instruction and wisdom contained in them.  By becoming familiar with his book, those who love to learn will be able to make even greater progress in living according to Yah's teachings.  I encourage you to be tolerant and open-minded when you read my grandfather's book.  I ask you to be forgiving where, despite my best efforts, I may not have translated some phrases very well.  Something originally written in Hebrew does not have the same force when translated into another language.  This is true of this book as well as Moses' teachings, the prophets, and the rest of the books.  Reading a translation of a book is very different from reading it in the original language.  I went to Egypt in the 38th year of King Urgetes reign.  During my stay there, I found a copy of my grandfather's book, which offered me a great deal of guidance.  I felt the need to translate this book.  During that time, I applied my skill day and night to finish translating the book.  I published it for those who live in foreign countries and those who are willing to learn Yah's teachings and want to live according to them.  Chapter 1 All wisdom comes from Yah, and it remains with Him forever.  Who can count the sand on the seashore, the drops of rain, or the days of eternity?  Who can search the height of the sky, the width of the earth, the depths of the ocean, or wisdom?  Wisdom was created before everything and useful knowledge has existed since the beginning.  Has the source of wisdom ever been revealed to anyone?  Who knows its secrets?  Only the one who sits on the throne is wise.  He should be greatly feared.  Yah is the only one who created wisdom.  He saw it and measured it.  He applied it to everything he made.  He applied as much of it to every living creature as he wanted.  He made it available to those who love him.  The fear of Yah brings honor, praise, happiness, and a crown of joy.  The fear of Yah delights the heart.  It gives happiness, joy, long life.  Everything will end well for people who fear YAH.  They will be blessed on the day of their death.  To fear YAH is the beginning of wisdom.  Wisdom forms in faithful people before they are born.  It is made an everlasting home in humans.  It will be trusted by their descendants.  The fear of YAH fills a person with wisdom.  Wisdom overwhelms humans with its gifts.  It fills all their homes with treasures and their storehouses with its produce.  The fear of Yah is a crown of wisdom.  It makes peace and good health flourish.  It produces knowledge and the ability to make wise decisions.  It gives more honor to those who hold on to it tightly.  To fear Yah is the root of wisdom and its branches are long life.  No one can excuse unjustifiable anger because anger leads to self-destruction.  Patient people stay calm until the right moment.  Then joy returns to them.  They do not speak until the right moment.  Then they gain a reputation for their good sense.  Examples of knowledge are among wisdom's treasures.  Being devout is disgusting to a sinner.  If you want wisdom, then obey the commandments and YAH will shower you with wisdom.  The fear of Yah is wisdom and instruction.  He is pleased with faithfulness and humility.  Don't stop fearing Yah.  When you approach Him, don't say one thing but think another.  Don't be a hypocrite towards people.  Instead, watch what you say.  Don't be arrogant or else you may fall and disgrace yourself.  YAH will reveal your secrets and throw you down in front of the whole assembly because you didn't fear YAH and your heart was full of deceit. ",
