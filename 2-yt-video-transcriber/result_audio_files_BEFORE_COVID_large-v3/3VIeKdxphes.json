            "text": "Don't do the Momo Challenge.  Don't do the Momo Challenge.  And again, I say for the jokers in the back, don't do the Momo Challenge.  It's bullcrap.  Now what they're saying now is Momo has reemerged.  It's something old from last year.  Now the timing is weird because we already got Fortnite videos being thrown in the mix for censoring videos because of some other crap that's supposed to be going on.  Now we get this.  Momo.  no no.  Momo challenging Peppa Pig in Fortnite videos as YouTube and Instagram fail to remove dangerous clips and... despite self-harm warnings?  And other articles are saying, the Momo Challenge is being hacked into the videos.  Now, I would have to say, I've never seen a video be hacked into, like, on YouTube.  Like, there's a video that exists, and then some video was hacked right in the middle of it.  Like, so say, for instance, PewDiePie has a video.  Like, he was the most subscribed channel.  I don't know, is his T-Series above him at this point?  But... I would think if people could hack, they'd probably be putting their little commercials in between PewDiePie's video if that was the case.  So I don't think it's being hacked like that.  It's more likely people are editing videos and then uploading.  Let's try to use that term.  Editing and uploading videos on YouTube.  Because hacking makes it seem like, oh man, anything could happen, anything could be hacked into to where they just put anything in the videos.  People that don't know any better, they just gonna fall for that crap.  Now what's being said without many examples of that is they're saying that this momo face joker is telling kids harmful things.  Now they're saying they're doing it on WhatsApp.  It's a dangerous WhatsApp suicide game.  So people are dialing this number, and they're talking to this Momo face.  Which, understand that it's a created character by these people, Japanese people, that have nothing to do with the Momo challenge.  So what's gonna happen here is they're gonna say, yeah, we have to do something.  What do you mean?  Okay, we have to do something.  But there's nobody to even go after.  Who's behind it?  Obviously, this is not a real person, but... It's one of those things where you're going to not actually go find the person that's behind it, and then you're going to end up going against other people and censoring other people who are doing stuff.  that's not even this, this bullcrap.  Meaning the same way they censored a lot of people for making videos questioning the government, but was saying, oh, we're just trying to stop harmful videos.  that's how it usually works.  now what they're saying is it's related or it's like the blue whale suicide game where some kid was found hanging in a secluded area with words like illuminati hangman and doubles one eye inscribed in a wall mother believing that it was because of the game.  cousin saying oh yeah i have seen hangman and and the images in momo app.  okay if i can find momo app and okay i see momo game or whatever and a few other momo apps.  so i don't see a specific momo app like they're saying.  but the way they word things is people are watching the peppa pig videos and the fortnite videos.  all of a sudden this image just pops up and then somehow they're being led to whatsapp and then they're talking to this momo and then this momo is sending them messages to do harmful things.  That's what they're making it seem like it is, but they don't give that many examples.  But one thing they are doing is we're gonna get the predictable call for accountability over online content in wake of Momo warnings.  Oh no, and as every parent should be worried about their kid's safety.  But a lot of times this system tries to take advantage of that in order to censor things that would be helpful for you.  Like, hey, exposing a corrupt government, tyrannical government that's trying to do bad things to you.  But what they do, they bring out these people, these cyber psychologists.  What?  Yeah.  They have a cyber psychologist and they're saying, my argument is that every abnormal criminal or deviant group can send links online and can target those who are vulnerable, such as children.  This behavior encouraging children to harm themselves is evidence of sadistic.  if not psychopathic intent.  But then you go down here, what else they saying though?  Cyber Safe Ireland, a charity which promotes online safety among children, said it's been contacted a number of times in recent days about Momo.  Okay, now understand this is a worldwide thing at this point, not just in America, not just in India, it's all over, even in Ireland.  However, okay, listen to this.  The charity said it has not seen evidence of cases where the challenge has caused harm to children in Ireland.  Parents are still being urged, however, to keep a close eye on your kids.  Simple and plain, keep a close eye on your dang kids, yoga.  You don't need me to say it.  You don't need the media to come out and say it, because what they'll do, they'll do this.  How can parents protect their children online?  Well, we looked at this recent study, and when sharing parenting advice on social media, getting kids to sleep, 28%.  Nutrition and eating tips, 26%.  discipline, 19%.  You see, I'm kinda reading it like how they do on Family Feud.  Just look at it that way.  It's bull crap.  It's always this, hey, come to us, we'll tell you what needs to be done.  No, no, no, no.  Handle your own household, watch your own kids.  Again, you don't need me to say it.  But what they want is some type of action.  like always.  so they're gonna say use this to scare you and then they're gonna say oh her bernie sanders what do you think about momo challenge?  why are we asking bernie panders about momo challenge?  he's he's a politician.  what do you mean?  oh we need laws about this type of stuff more censorship and if we're gonna do things like that if we're gonna be the ones to censor momo challenge.  I can look back at some old videos where YouTubers react to the Momo Challenge and these are the top YouTubers.  And they're reacting to this picture of this Momo face.  And they also have a prank.  They're pranking the people pretending like they're Momo.  And then they're reacting, oh, I'm scared.  And they're sending the messages, the little scary messages to the people.  Which then brings something else that, you know, the media will never talk about is how easy you can be manipulated.  Okay, remember this stuff is all on camera for the most part of what you see.  This Momo could be any freaking body.  And for the example of the YouTubers react to the Momo challenge, it was not even the original Momo.  It was somebody else pretending to be Momo.  They had a WhatsApp and then they fake like they were sending a little message.  Well, they were sending messages, but they fake like they were Momo.  Anybody could pretend to be Momo and say evil things and then, on the same side, go and say, oh, well, we need accountability.  The same exact person calling for accountability in online content could be the same exact person doing the Momo pretend video.  Not saying that person is the original Momo, but that is very much a possibility and you should be aware of that.  All of this hoopla.  Oh my gosh, oh no!  Then when you look back at the old videos, for example, YouTubers react to Momo Challenge, and people looking at it like it's just a little stupid joke.  It's one of those Bloody Mary, you say Bloody Mary three times in the mirror, then uh-oh, it's gonna get you type thing.  Now, I'm not defending the crap.  I think it's all bull crap, it's trash, it shouldn't be happening.  But the whole details, I don't think they're really saying the details correct.  Something ain't right.  I mean, we can even go back to where they talking about this.  The little cousin talk about, yeah, he's seen the hangman, he's seen the images.  And then what he say though, in the Momo app.  In the Momo app?  Yeah, the game is responsible for a suicide.  What, Momo app now?  I thought we was talking about WhatsApp.  So WhatsApp is just Momo app now?  See, jugglers don't even get the details right.  So they want to call for accountability over online content.  Yet again, we hear this over and over again.  A lot of people, not saying everybody, but some people run these little crusades, these little fake outrage, fake mad, to take their YouTube career to the next level looking trick.  I've seen them.  Yeah, they're scumbags.  But look, whatever.  That is what it is.  They can do their little crap.  But the main thing for us, just remain level-headed, aware, understand the troll armies that are around the world that can do harmful things, that can leave harmful comments, and even pull off harmful pranks.  And then... run off into the sunset anonymously, never being found, and then people's freedom of speech is being taken.  Our freedom of speech.  That's been happening a lot, I've been noticing.  And just understand how the media hypes things and then don't give the exact details.  But all in all, I want to say this again, don't do the Momo Challenge.  However, look, they don't even tell you how it's really done.  I mean, I would think if it's WhatsApp when you have to get the number and then call the number, and then after you call the number, then you're corresponding with this Momo person.  So you have to go through different steps.  You watch the video, get the number, then call it then.  So how many kids do you think are really falling into that?  But whatever, I was ending the video.  Don't do the Momo challenge. ",
