            "text": "Bill Gaither, the master marketer and head guru of Christian music today, has answered the whore of Babylon's call for her babies to come home.  Ladies and gentlemen, your friend Spencer here.  Bill Gaither has been an interesting guy to me through the years.  When I first got saved, one of the very first Christian CDs I ever bought was a Gaither Homecoming, and I did enjoy it.  They sang a lot of old hymns.  Bill Gaither really has been what I've classified the Babe Ruth of Christian music.  What I mean by that, if you don't know, Babe Ruth was the famous baseball player, and he would lead the league in home runs, but he would also lead the league in strikeouts.  So really, with Babe Ruth, there was no in-between.  He either struck out or he knocked a home run.  Bill Gaither, I think, is very similar as far as his contributions to Christian music.  He's either really struck out bad or... Or he's hit a home run.  I think one of the home runs that he hit was a song called Because He Lives.  And we all know that song, Because He Lives, I Can Face Tomorrow, Because He Lives, All Fear Is Gone.  Great song.  I really think he's made a great contribution to the Christian world as far as that song goes.  But at the same time, also, I want to say that I think that maybe, maybe nobody on the planet has done more to destroy Christian music than than Bill Gaither.  And he really has been an anomaly to me.  Now, on this channel, we've talked several times about neo-evangelicalism, modernism, and Catholicism, and fundamentalism, okay?  And so the five camps that I've basically classified everybody in today, you got your Catholics, you got modernists, you got neo-evangelicals, you got fundamentalists, and you have Baptists.  Those are the five camps.  Now, you take the fundamentalists and Baptists out, and once you've Break that line.  All the currents and all the river goes towards Rome.  Everything goes to Rome in Neo-Evangelicalism.  And the end of the road of Neo-Evangelicalism is going to be the Roman Catholic Church.  If you want to join hands with other denominations and work interdenominationally and do all that stuff, you will eventually find your kids and grandkids kissing the ring of the Pope.  That is not controversial.  That is a fact.  That is true.  Now, Bill Gaither, of course, has been in the ecumenical movement as long as I've been alive.  He's been around this stuff.  He's actually a Nazarene by denomination.  But he fellowships with all kinds.  And I want you to see this new song that came out just last year in October.  They released this video of Jesus is Everywhere.  And the lyrics of this song are blatant Roman Catholicism.  And I want to break this down to you.  And then I want to give some comments about Southern Gospel in general.  So let's watch this video together.  Now, one thing I want to say about southern gospel music is that I have survived some very, very bad dance crazes in my time.  I have survived the Macarena, and anybody who can survive the Macarena is doing pretty good.  I have not been able to survive the cheesy dance maneuvers of southern gospel musicians.  You can tell these men are lip-syncing.  There are no microphones in their hands.  There's no lapel mics.  There's no boom mic over them.  They are lip-syncing this, and they're not doing worship.  This is a performance.  At some point, you've got to think, that's got to hurt.  Physically, that's got to hurt.  But that's just my opinion, so whatever.  Okay, let me say this real quick.  I used to work at a car dealer and I can spot a slimy guy from a mile away.  A con man, they're always doing stuff like this.  Hey.  That is so shady.  It's so disingenuous.  I don't know why people even fall for this stuff.  I mean, when a man's filled with the Holy Spirit and he's singing, he's not going to always be going... That's showmanship.  I mean, these guys literally are a state fair act.  They're not even a state, they're a county fair act.  They're that bad at this stuff.  And I don't know why Southern Gospel has to be so showy.  I guess maybe it has to do with the fact that when the Holy Spirit's not involved in it, you have to work something up.  And so therefore you're like, hey guys.  All the time.  When a man's doing that, that's not the Holy Spirit.  That's not the Holy Spirit.  I just want to let you know that.  Does anybody think like me that this sounds like the Hotel California?  This sounds like an old Eagle song.  This isn't even good music, let alone contemporary or conservative.  This just isn't even good.  That's so ridiculous, y'all.  Come on, let's get real.  Okay, there is more hair product in this video.  then I mean, like if they were to take all the hair product out of these guys and lay it down on a piece of paper, they can make a sticky trap big enough to catch a German shepherd.  That's ridiculous.  But I want you to see this.  The second verse is really what I want to talk about.  And I want you to hear these lyrics and I'll read them to you.  And then we're going to talk about the Catholicism in this verse and in this song.  On the sunnest side of town Church bells ring out in San Loco.  So we went in and sat down.  We forgot that it was Sunday.  The priest was hard to understand But we heard the word for Jesus Holding wafers in our hands.  Okay, I can't do any more of that.  That is like nails on a chalkboard.  I mean, I would rather hear Gilbert Godfrey sing the Hallelujah Chorus.  I really would.  This is so bad.  But let me read to you the lyrics to this song here.  And this is the second verse on a winding street.  Let me just move my screen here on a winding street in Venice on the sunny side of town.  Church bells ring out in San Rocco.  So he went in and sat down.  We forgot that it was Sunday.  The priest was hard to understand, but we heard the word for Jesus holding wafers.  in our hand.  Notice this here.  Jesus is in the water.  Jesus is in the wine.  I never thought that a day would come where a Nazarene man in the southern gospel music industry would openly be singing about the Roman Catholic practice of transubstantiation.  That's what this is.  When they do the Catholic mass, they are actually doing an enchantment.  They walk around with a smoky pot and incense.  They burn And they go around these unleavened bread wafers and this real wine.  And really what they're doing is an occult ritual trying to turn this bread and wine into the physical body and blood of Jesus Christ.  And so they eat that.  And that's what they say about receiving Jesus.  So when a Catholic says he's receiving Jesus, what he means is he said, I ate Jesus.  I drank his blood.  Really, that's cannibalism is what that is.  And that's what they're singing about here.  Jesus is in the water, Jesus is in the wine.  That right there should offend everybody who believes in salvation by grace through faith.  That should bother you.  that Bill Gaither is singing Roman Catholic songs now.  It's just unbelievable.  Now let me show you this in Revelation chapter 17 about the great whore of Babylon.  I want you to notice the striking similarity to this with Roman Catholicism.  It talks about the great horse sitting upon the water, verse number one.  Kings of the earth committed fornication with her.  And so there's a woman sitting upon the scarlet beast.  And then verse four, this woman, and I believe this harlot is an abomination, is a copy of the bride of Christ.  So it's going to be a, you know, there is the bride of Christ, the church, the real church.  And then there's a harlot that sits upon a beast.  That is the Satan's church.  That's Satan's false end times church.  And the Bible says in verse 4 that this end times church, this woman, was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, decked with golden precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness over fornication.  You just go Google and look at the cup that these priests hold.  golden cup if you will.  and so but look in verse number six and it said here and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.  when I saw her I wondered with great admiration.  now the the characteristic if you will of the harlot church is that she will persecute the real church and She will try to destroy the real church.  Now, people say, you know, I've dealt with a couple of things about church history and on our channel here dealt with, you know, people say throw, you know, landmark and secessionism at me.  That's not, I don't accept those titles.  I just believe that there always has been a real church on the planet.  and that church may have gone underground at some points in time because of persecution, but I definitely, definitely do not believe that the Roman Catholic Church was the original church.  That is just not true.  The Roman Catholic Church has nothing in common with the church in the book of Acts.  It has nothing in common with the New Testament.  It has zero in common with the Apostle Paul, and so therefore I reject the idea that the Roman Catholic Church is the original church.  It's just not true.  But one thing I can tell you about church history is that church history largely, is the story of Catholics killing non-Catholics.  Really, that's what most church history is.  And the reason that the pilgrims came to the United States was to escape the darkness of popery.  The United States of America was started as a safe haven for people to flee Europe so that they could get away from the bloodthirsty religion known as Roman Catholicism.  That is church history.  If you don't believe that, then you need to go online and on Amazon and buy you a copy of the Fox's Book of Martyrs.  You need to go read that.  That is basically Catholic people killing people for not being Catholic.  And in the end times, in the book of Revelation, chapter 17, you have the great whore doing the same thing.  In verse number six, I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.  And when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.  That is, I believe that's the end times church.  That's the Catholic church, drunken with the blood of martyrs.  You know, the governments have killed people.  The Black Plague killed people.  But I tell you what, the Roman Catholic Church has really been responsible for literally millions of corpses throughout church history.  So that's something to consider.  Now, Bill Gaither is going right back into all that, and he is going into... Catholicism and yoking up with all that.  I cannot believe that an evangelical Christian would sing something so blatantly heretical, so blatantly wicked, and so blatantly, unbelievably, undoctrinal, unbiblical.  But then again, these are not Christian heroes.  These are not men who are standing for the faith.  These are not people that are contending for the faith.  These are showmen that are singing gospel and spiritual-like music.  So they can make a living.  That's what they're doing.  And so I guess maybe we shouldn't be surprised when they compromise.  Maybe we shouldn't be surprised when they go the wrong way.  Nothing surprises me in the music industry anymore.  And this is where discernment comes in.  You've got to know your Bible.  You've got to know the truth.  You've got to know church history and this kind of stuff.  If you don't get rooted and grounded in this, then you will be blown away with every wind of doctrine that comes along.  And listen, when the winds start blowing, the roots start getting pulled up.  And if you're not rooted in a Bible-believing church, and if you're not rooted in your own personal knowledge of the Bible, and if you're not walking with God, and you're not exercising discernment, and you're not learning what truth is and learn how to differentiate truth from error, then you will be swept away with these winds of bad doctrine that are coming through.  And Bill Gaither apparently has revealed that he's being swept away into Roman Catholicism, and that's not good.  And so I want to warn you about that and realize that neo-evangelicalism, the idea of trying to hold hands with liberals and conservatives, trying to be this hybrid in the middle, always, always, always leads to Roman Catholicism.  The road of theological compromise always leads to Rome.  Bill Gaither's grandkids and children are going to be kissing the ring of the Pope and worshiping the Virgin Mary, what the book of Jeremiah chapter 45 calls the Queen of Heaven.  That's dangerous stuff.  Stay away.  2 Corinthians 6 says, Come out from among them and be ye separate.  Saith the Lord, I will receive you and be a father unto you.  There's a joy and there's a peace in being separated from error, separated from apostasy.  Come out from among that stuff.  Get away from it.  And you'll know what it is to live the Christian life.  And it's wonderful.  It really is.  It really is wonderful.  But you have to avoid these pitfalls if you're going to do that.  And this is one of them.  This is a bad one.  I really feel bad for Bill Gaither.  But at the same time, I guess, you know, When your goal is just to sell CDs, then eventually you will compromise truth because truth sometimes is not convenient, especially when you're in it for the money.
