My name is Lex and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we unlearn the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  If that sounds interesting to you, then subscribe to this channel and click the bell to be notified when new teachings are available.  Let's get started.  Halloween is a topic of much debate among Christians.  There are a variety of opinions on the topic.  Some say we should have nothing to do with it.  Others substitute fall festivals and trunk or treat as church alternatives.  While other Christians embrace Halloween completely.  But what does the Bible have to say about it?  Obviously, the word Halloween doesn't appear in the Bible.  But it does speak about some of the themes associated with it.  So I want to look at the history of Halloween and what the Bible says about those things.  Let's begin with a little history lesson.  In the 7th century, Pope Boniface IV consecrated the Pantheon at Rome and ordered an anniversary feast of the dedication to be celebrated each year on May 13th, which was the date of the pagan festival of Lumerilia in Rome.  Lumerilia was a feast in the religion of ancient Rome during which they performed rites to exorcise evil spirits of the dead from their homes.  The Pantheon was the temple of all the gods of Rome, and the Pope turned it into a church, and he ordered an annual celebration of this event on the date of a pagan holiday.  This is clearly forbidden in Scripture.  The Bible tells us to destroy the pagan places of worship and not to use those things to worship God.  You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations which you shall dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.  And you shall destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and burn their wooden images with fire.  and you shall cut down their carved images of their gods and destroy their names from that place.  You shall not worship the Lord your God with such  things.\".  Now back to our history lesson.  In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III moved the date of this celebration to November 1st, causing All Saints Day to fall on the Gaelic festival of Samhain, which had a similar theme as the Roman festival of Lemurilia.  Samhain was the Gaelic festival of the dead and the celebration of the beginning of the darker half of the year.  Samhain is believed to have Celtic pagan origins, and it's been an important pagan celebration since ancient times.  It's widely known that many of the modern customs of Halloween originate from the pagan festival of Samhain.  For example, the Druids believed Samhain, the god of death, sent evil spirits out to attack humans, and they could only escape by wearing a disguise to make them look like evil spirits themselves.  This is where the tradition of wearing Halloween costumes originates.  But the Bible tells us to abstain from every form of evil.  Test all things, hold fast to what is good, abstain from every form of evil.  So if wearing Halloween costumes is based on the pagan tradition of dressing up like evil spirits, then as Christians, we should avoid such pagan superstitions because they are a form of evil.  Some people will argue that it's just fun for the kids and there's no harm in it.  But the Bible says, Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil, that put darkness for light and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.  Other Halloween traditions such as bonfires, jack-o'-lanterns, and trick-or-treating can all be traced back to this pagan holiday as well.  These are practices that Christians learned from the pagan religions and were not instructed by God.  But the Bible tells us not to be like the pagans and not to imitate their abominable practices.  When the Lord your God cuts off from before you the nations which you go to dispossess, and you displace them and dwell in their land, take heed to yourselves that you are not ensnared to follow them after they are destroyed from before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods?  I will also do likewise.  You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way.  For every abomination to the Lord which He hates they have done to their gods.  For they burn even their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.  Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it.  You shall not add to it nor take away from  it.\".  Okay, now let's look at the name Halloween, which is derived from All Hallows Eve.  The word hallow means to honor as holy, and is closely associated with worship.  We find this word in the prayer Yeshua taught His disciples, Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.  In the Catholic religion, All Hallows Eve, October 31st, is the night before All Saints Day.  This celebration is for the purpose of hallowing the dead saints.  Listen to what the Catholic Encyclopedia says about this celebration.  Solemnity, celebrated on the first of November.  It is instituted to honor all the saints.  The church, feeling that every martyr should be venerated, appointed a common day for all.  Gregor III consecrated a chapel at the Basilica of St.  Peter to all the saints and fixed the anniversary for the first of November.  This is known as veneration of the dead, and it's a pagan practice.  Samhain is also a celebration of the dead and involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones who have died.  The Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church both venerate dead saints as intercessors with God.  They pray to the dead saints and ask the dead saints to intercede for them.  This belief cannot be found anywhere in the Bible.  In fact, we are commanded in the Bible not to practice necromancy.  which is communication with the dead.  Necromancy is communication with the dead, and is connected to witchcraft.  Praying to the dead saints is necromancy, and is strictly forbidden in the Bible.  These ties to witchcraft are not superficial.  Not only do these practices originate with pagan witchcraft, but they are currently practiced by modern witches involved in Wicca as pagans, neo-pagans, and other occult practitioners.  In fact, Samhain is listed as one of the important pagan festivals on the pagan wheel of the year, and is considered by Wiccans to be one of the four greater pagan festivals.  Halloween is associated with witchcraft, the occult, and sorcery, and the Bible makes it clear that these practices are an abomination to the Lord.  These associations should be enough reason to avoid Halloween, because the Bible tells us, \"...have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose  them.\".  We are told to avoid such works of darkness and to expose them, which is what I'm trying to do with this video.  I also want to point out that Halloween has strong associations with fear.  The themes of Halloween include vampires, ghosts, monsters, graves, zombies, witches, haunted houses, horror movies, and other scary things.  This traces back to the pagan belief that evil spirits roamed the earth on that day, and they would put on scary costumes to disguise themselves as evil spirits.  This type of superstitious fear is not biblical.  For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of sound mind.  When Christians celebrate the same festivals as witches and pagans, they are being unequally yoked together with them, and participating in a type of fellowship that is forbidden in the Bible.  Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness, and what communion has light with darkness?  Think about something.  Does Halloween bring glory to God?  Because everything we do should bring glory to God.  Celebrating death, horror, and witchcraft doesn't celebrate the God of the living.  It brings glory to the dead.  Stop trying to justify Halloween.  Anyone who wants to follow the Messiah should have nothing to do with it.  Thanks for watching.
