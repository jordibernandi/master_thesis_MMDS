So let's start here.  Gravitational force acting per kilogram.  is calculated by this.  This is a gravitational constant mass of the Earth, and that is a distance to the object from the centre of the Earth.  And this is where a lot of flat earthers fall down, because you imagine that gravity is measured from the surface of the Earth, and it's not.  It's the centre of the Earth.  Now, the radius of the Earth is 6,357 kilometres-ish.  OK?  Space, or the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, is about 100 kilometres up.  Now, if we plug all of these numbers in, then the force that we get on the surface of the Earth is about 9.8 newtons per kilogram, which is the 9.8 meters per second squared that we see as an acceleration.  If we look at the Kalman line, where you're claiming gravity is so extremely weak that it's almost non-existent, If we plug those numbers in there with the extra 100 kilometers, then what we actually get is just short of 9.6 Newtons per kilogram.  So that's about a 2% decrease in gravity.  Let's move on. ",

And when you misunderstand and misrepresent so badly, then of course you're going to think it's false.  You seem to think for some unknown reason that at the edge of space, that gravity is so extremely weak that it can't hold on to any atmosphere whatsoever.  When in reality, as we've shown at the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, it's about 2% less, give or take a little bit.  You seem to think that a vacuum is, for some reason, a little bit of earth squeezed out of a bottle.  You seem to think that the second law of thermodynamics is about the movement of matter and not about the movement of energy.  But worst of all, to destroy your undebunkable experiment, as you called it, to destroy that, all I had to do was show you a little simple demonstration I do in the classroom with 11-year-old children.  And now I'm challenging you to do that demonstration.  I'm challenging you to put that straw in a jar, to seal that container properly and see if you can drink the water.  And you will find that as soon as you open the lid, you can.  And that is because the air is pressing down.  The vacuum isn't sucking.  You were wrong.  You call me a fucking fool, but you've just been schooled.  See you, Bob. ",
