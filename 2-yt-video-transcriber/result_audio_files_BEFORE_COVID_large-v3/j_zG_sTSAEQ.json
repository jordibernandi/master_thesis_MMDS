Before we dive into the details of this video today, I just wanna remind you that my partner Big Daddy Unlimited is offering 99 cent first month memberships.  So check out bigdaddyunlimited.com.  forward slash MTC so they know that I sent you.  If you're a gun or an outdoor type person, you will appreciate it.  Centerville, Iowa.  I'm going to break down what is ultimately a little over a seven minute piece of body cam footage that was released.  into its relevant parts.  I'm gonna keep it shorter so that you're not just wasting a lot of time watching the body cam footage.  But what's the relevant information here?  is that you have, I'll butcher everybody's names, so I'm just not even gonna worry about the names, but you have arresting officer attempting to place subject under arrest for a warrant that he has ran.  And it seems to me like the subject is a little, let's say, left of center, a few fries short of a happy meal, missing Lego parts, whatever the case is with this guy.  He's... quite normal.  In fact, he's going to say that he can execute the death penalty and charge this officer's children if he tries to arrest him.  It gets weird.  You'll listen to that.  The officer tries to arrest him.  The bad guy accosts the officer.  He's ultimately charged with attempted murder.  Another officer who is a sergeant, he appears to me to be off duty, comes by and is able to help bring this guy under physical control.  He gets tased.  He gets handcuffed.  Good guys win in this case.  So check out the body cam footage.  At the end of that on the other side, I will explain where I feel there's lessons to be learned. ",

First thing I would like to point out, especially if you are an officer, but if you're paying attention to this and you're just interested in general, or you may be planning to be an officer one day, remember this, always, always, always.  do thorough checks of anybody that is going to go into your vehicle.  It could have been done outside of the view of the camera.  I could have missed it.  I will admit that.  I don't know.  But what I do see is this officer asks him multiple times, do you have any knives?  Do you have any knives or guns on you?  He's not checking the subject.  And then he steps next to the subject.  I'm going to assume the officer is right-handed, so exposes his gun to the the subject outside the vehicle while he reaches in the vehicle to move stuff to sit this guy down.  So he's putting someone in his vehicle without a full thorough check for weapons.  Bad, bad tactic.  Now, this officer may in general be very sound with that stuff.  This is just something that I noticed.  And it's fortunate in this case that there were no lethal weapons involved in either side, really, but not against the officer who's trying to execute a lawful arrest in this case.  Man, just make sure you are checking your subjects.  Second is the value of having obviously more than one person.  Before you're going to make an arrest, if you can have another officer present, this is all safety and tactics related things that I'm just thinking about as I'm watching this.  If you can have another officer there, have another officer there before you try to arrest someone.  It's not a perfect world.  Some departments are smaller.  It's not always an easy circumstance to be able to do it, and you're gonna have to handle arresting someone yourself.  That's a reality.  But if you can have somebody else have them, in this case, we see another officer, a sergeant, come onto scene.  He's wearing sweatpants, so I'm assuming he's not actively working.  Maybe he's undercover, I don't know.  But he's the one that's able to physically get this guy off of the other officer and into physical control.  the assistance of the taser, the less than lethal application, and then they get them into handcuffs.  Backup is always helpful, but something particular about this backup is that there is a physical control applied and knowing how to handle yourself physically In ground fighting, grappling, you've heard me preach this a thousand times.  I'll preach it 10,000 more.  Knowing how to grapple is key.  It is absolutely critical for law enforcement.  Absolutely critical for anybody who has the powers of arrest in any capacity.  Know how to execute.  ground control techniques, escapes, evasion, and subject control procedures.  So those are just a few of the things that I noticed.  Maybe that's helpful to you.  Maybe it's not.  Discuss your thoughts in the comments, and I'll put the relevant facts of the case in the description.  All right, thanks, guys. ",
