            "text": "All right there, everyone.  Another ultra-liberal college is collapsing.  And what it means for the future of conservative education, that's what we'll be talking about on today's video.  I want to give a huge shout out to one of our subscribers, Christopher, for bringing this story to my attention.  A huge thanks to you, Christopher.  Very much appreciated.  Now, we just did a video a few days back On the ultra-liberal Oberlin College in Ohio, where a number of administration officials, faculty, and students deliberately tried to destroy a bakery that had been a staple in that town for decades just because that bakery had the gall to enforce the law against an underage Oberlin student who tried to steal alcohol from the store.  When the student was caught, he and two of his friends began beating the store clerk and were subsequently arrested and charged.  Now, because the three students happened to be black, a number of Oberlin College's social justice warriors, they freaked out and declared the bakery to be racist and discriminatory and actively attempted to shut it down.  Well, the owners would have none of that.  They took Oberlin College to court and the jury ordered the college to pay the owners of the bakery an astonishing $44 million in damages.  Well, now we have another example of decency prevailing over manufactured outrage and grievance.  It involves a college in Massachusetts called Hampshire College.  It all started back on November the 8th, 2016.  You all remember that date.  It's a wonderful date in history, isn't it?  It's the date that rocked the globalist world order when Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States.  Shortly after President Trump's election, if you can believe it, I'm sure you can, Hampshire College students demanded that the college take down the American flag from university property.  It demanded that the college approved.  The college allowed the American flag to be removed from its main flagpole as protest against the election of Donald Trump.  And according to the New York Times, the flag was subsequently burned.  Well, that ignited the ire of a group of military veterans, God bless them, about 400 of which came out and held a protest at Hampshire College as a sign of solidarity and respect.  for the flag and for veterans.  They came out with their own American flags waving and demonstrating their shock that a college would allow for such disrespect and disdain among their student body and faculty.  Well, since then, the college has begun to implode.  They've had to cut 82 positions from their 400-member payroll.  And in January of this year, the Hampshire College president announced that the college was in such financial jeopardy that they wouldn't be admitting a freshman class for the fall of 2019.  Now, after a number of protests on that, The president relented and allowed for a freshman class of up to around close to 80 students.  But when all was said and done, the total incoming freshman class for this fall is estimated to be no more than a measly 15 students.  That number represents an astonishing 94% decrease for the college's 2018 freshman class of nearly 300 students.  The overall enrollment has plunged from nearly 1,200 students to barely 600.  And as things couldn't get worse, they're now in danger of losing their accreditation.  Just an utterly stunning fall.  Now, Hampshire College's reprehensible treatment of the American flag, along with the Oberlin social justice warrior, fiasco are all but the latest examples of campus insanity blowing up in their face.  These are quintessential examples of how getting woke only means going broke.  And this is becoming a reality for more and more colleges.  You may not be aware of the fact.  it's simply the case.  liberal elitist colleges are indeed facing what even left-wing liberals are calling an existential threat.  More and more colleges are seeing imploding enrollment.  A recent article on Boston.com found that across the country, more than two-thirds of private colleges and a majority of public colleges and universities failed to meet their enrollment goals back in 2016.  And of course, declining enrollment means declining tuition revenue, which in turn means layoffs of faculty and staff.  I saw this personally at the university that I was a part of for 20 years.  They were slashing faculty numbers a few years back.  I mean, it was an utter bloodbath, shocking really, how many even tenured professors were let go because of budget shortfalls caused by an imploding enrollment.  And in many respects, the forecast is It's just the beginning.  These decreasing enrollment trends are mere tremors compared to the earthquake just around the corner.  over the next decade that's going to shake the higher education industry to its core.  And that's largely because of a massive downturn in the United States birth rate, where we saw over 2 million fewer babies between the years 2008, 2013.  It's largely attributed to the economic downturn.  And birth rates have continued to drop since then.  And college presidents are coming out and saying, this represents nothing less than an existential threat to the very survival of many colleges throughout the nation.  The predictions are dire.  They are absolutely dire.  Anywhere from 25% to as high as 50% of private colleges are projected to close over the next decade.  But what these statistics don't show is a strange anomaly to this enrollment implosion.  There are colleges that are seeing surges in their enrollment.  And would you like to take a guess on what those colleges are?  What do you know?  They're all conservative Christian colleges.  Conservative Christian colleges are exploding in enrollment.  According to the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities, the 150 colleges that they represent have grown on average by an astonishing 20% in their enrollment since 2003.  Again, all the while the absolute enrollment among universities nationwide is down.  What all this means is that more and more, liberal left-wing globalist institutions are collapsing.  They're falling apart.  And I don't think we have to look far as to why.  It's not just fertility drops.  That would affect conservative Christian colleges as well.  But of course, as we've talked about on a number of occasions on other videos, conservative Christians are actually having children while secular liberals aren't.  They're disappearing.  So conservative Christian colleges appear largely immune from this decreasing enrollment trend.  But more than that, liberal institutions are imploding under the weight of their own absurdity.  One of the things that we have to understand is that while there is, of course, A massive populist uprising going on all over the world.  That populist uprising is a reaction to the indisputable fact that secular globalist liberals have all the institutional power.  We've talked about this before, right?  They own our political parties.  They own our banks.  They own our corporations, our media.  They own the church.  They own economic institutions.  And of course, of course, perhaps ground zero, they own the universities and college campuses.  But what are we seeing?  We're seeing these elitist institutions beginning to collapse under the weight of their own absurdity.  They speak a language and adhere to a behavior that the rest of the population just doesn't comprehend, and in point of fact, finds odious.  And as such, these educational institutions are just beginning to implode.  All we have to do is just sit here and watch.  As always, please like, comment, and subscribe.
