            "text": "Hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  I want to talk to you about something recently that happened at Bethel Church in Redding, California.  As far as I know, it actually still is going on at Bethel Church in Redding, California.  Now, I started this channel years ago because I realized just doing mission work and traveling through Africa and even traveling the United States that it seemed like there was just two veins of Christianity one was trying to hold to a biblical concept and the other was kind of just some way out there.  crazy stuff.  and I noticed as I looked in the Eastern religions dealing with those in Africa.  I come back to America and I realize that some of these some of these denominations here in America have just incredible just wild similarities to Eastern religions to the point where it's alarming.  It's scary to me.  I mean, it kind of makes me nervous.  And so I started checking into that, and that led me to study the contemporary Christian music.  And then I started this channel trying to expose some of the things that I learned.  And the big names, there's two big names in the contemporary Christian music world that I've always warned people about and said, look, stay away from these people.  They're poison.  This is bad stuff.  This is spiritual plutonium.  You want to get away from these people.  This is bad stuff.  And those two names were Hillsong and Badass.  Bethel.  Now those are basically the two heads of the monster known as contemporary Christian music today.  And really I think that these guys, I'm convinced that both of those churches are not Christian churches.  I'm convinced that they're Eastern religions, New Age religions that are kind of putting a facade of Christianity in front of people to deceive the masses and sneak in New Age philosophies and teachings into these congregations.  And so Something went on with Bethel this weekend, and I want to just say real quick before we get into this that my conversation, the issue that I've been pushing has been to stop looking at the music, take into account the big picture, take into account the entire thing, take into account the doctrine that these people teach and preach, because that is something that you need to, you really need to take that into the formula when you're evaluating music.  whether or not God is on these people or not, or if this is a true church or not, or if this is not some cunningly devised heresy that Satan has worked up.  Well, basically, let me just give you the rundown of what's going on at Bethel in Redding, California.  One of the worship leaders had a child that tragically died.  And I just feel so bad for this family.  This child looks like they weren't even two years old, just a little, just a baby.  And the baby on, from what I understand, This child on Saturday was declared dead by doctors.  The child had stopped breathing and just terrible, terrible situation.  Well, I can't even believe what I'm about to tell you.  I cannot believe that these words are about to come out of my mouth.  But all weekend, Bethel had worship services asking God to resurrect this dead child.  I don't even know how... I don't even know how much worse it can get than that.  I don't even know how it's even possible to experience every emotion at the same time.  But I think I'm probably there.  I'm sad for this family.  I'm angry at these people.  I'm appalled that this church would actually do this.  But that's what they're doing.  It's all over Instagram.  And I just want to read you the article here because this is something... I don't even know what to say to this stuff, ladies and gentlemen.  I don't even know what to say.  Now I'm going to give you what this article says and I'm going to explain to you why they believe this.  So stay with me here and let me just read you a few articles or just a few things here.  Bethel Singer's infant daughter pronounced dead by doctors, quote, praying for a miracle.  This is 1216, which I believe was Saturday.  And let's see here, today's, no, that was Monday, so that's when this article came out, so yesterday.  Bethel worship leader Callie Heiligenthal, which I believe that's how her last name is spelled, I'm just going to call her Callie, has called upon the global church to pray for her young daughter Olive, who died over the weekend.  Callie and her husband Andrew believe that their daughter can be raised back to life by the power of Jesus Christ and are asking brothers and sisters in the faith to join with them in praying for a miracle.  Quote, We're asking for a prayer.  we believe in a Jesus who died and conclusively defeated every grave, holding the keys to resurrection power, Kelly wrote, noting that Olive had been pronounced dead by doctors on Saturday after she stopped breathing.  We're asking for bold, unverified prayers from the global church to stand with us in belief that he will raise this little girl back to life, the heartbroken mother added.  Her time here is not done, and it is our time to believe boldly and with confidence wield that Jesus paid for.  It's time for her to come to life.  What do you say to that?  I mean, what she said is we believe in a Jesus that... that promised that you'd never die.  And I don't know if this woman is just having emotional problems because of this, which, I mean, understandably, oh, God help this woman that she's having a hard time with this.  God help this lady.  I pray for her.  I ask God to help her, give her strength.  But this is a... devastating, heretical statement that she's saying about the Lord.  We're asking for, she said here, we believe in a Jesus who died and conclusively defeated every grave, holding the keys to resurrection power.  And, oh my.  Over the weekend, asking God to raise this child back to life.  Ladies and gentlemen, she's grossly misunderstanding who God is.  And I feel sad for her because what she's saying is really just... I hate that.  I don't even know what to say.  And so let me just go on.  She sees a picture of this beautiful little girl here and just so sad.  But this is where... That's the sad part.  But this is the part that makes me just absolutely off the charts angry and upset with these people.  This article saying, Bethel's Jen Johnson and Dominic Chabon shared a video on Instagram of Kaylee herself leading worship on Sunday.  This astonishing figure shows Kaylee boldly declaring God will revive her daughter with the church passionately echoing the cry of the Holy Spirit to move.  And so, I mean, this woman's up there.  That's her.  I mean, just unbelievable that they're allowing her to do this.  And this woman needs to go home and grieve her loss of her child.  But this is Jen Johnson, who I believe is the wife of Bill Johnson, the pastor of Bethel Church.  And she's posing these videos of this.  And... I mean, they're... And here's the worst part, okay?  They're praying openly that God would resurrect this child who's been medically deceased since Saturday.  And Bill Johnson's wife is putting up this with the hashtag right there in front of your face, WakeUpOlive.  That's unspeakably, unspeakably horrible to this family to do that.  Unspeakable.  And to let this... I mean, this is going to compound the grief of this family.  This is giving them a false hope.  They have led this family to believe that Jesus does this in these days.  And the truth is that child will live again.  That child is... Jesus won the victory over the grave.  But not now.  There is a coming a day where that child will live again.  And... They're misunderstanding, and that's what they're doing.  I want to just give you just a little bit more.  She's saying, you know, even when I see it, you're working and all this stuff.  And it goes on, and even Bethel Music is posting on their Instagram page these people that are writing the word olive on their hands and just asking God all weekend to resurrect this child who had been declared medically dead.  I mean, even this guy here saying, you know, this is the drummer there of Bethel Church.  He's saying, we're fighting for you tonight, baby girl.  You know, you're drumming and you're... whatever it is, your repetitive hypnotic music that you're doing, this isn't going to bring this child to life.  This is not going to happen.  Okay, and this poor family, these poor people, and the false hope that they've been given.  Okay, that's unspeakable.  Unspeakable.  Bill Johnson has led these people down a path to believe this type of theology and believe in this.  Bill Johnson is a horrible man.  He is a rank heretic.  Bill Johnson, you are going straight to hell if you don't repent of this wickedness and trust Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.  That's an unspeakable thing to do to a family in their time of grief.  is to give them that false hope.  okay that that's.  i can't believe that you would lead this family and lead this ministry to do that.  you you are a despicable human being mr bill johnson.  you are a vile human and your end shall be according to your works according to the bible.  you are a false teacher and you are a wicked man and i can't even believe that you would ever.  i mean i don't even see how you step out in public.  i don't even see how you have a conscience.  i don't even see how you sleep at night doing stuff like this to these families.  Unbelievable, unspeakable.  And I want to say this.  Let me explain to you why they're doing this and why they practice this, okay?  Hinduism and occultism have this idea here that... Let me just give you a statement that I read, and I think this is a very good statement.  It has to do basically with the Law of Attraction, which is a Hindu concept.  There's a book called The Law of Attraction, and if you ever get to read it, it's a pretty interesting book.  But it's an occultic Hindu idea... Helena Blavatsky actually promoted this.  She was an occultist, an esoteric person, a Russian woman.  She's very interesting, really, if you ever get into her.  Basically, it's the idea that we have faith in faith.  And it's an esoteric idea that you can change reality with a spoken word.  If I just have faith to speak what I believe could happen, then it can happen.  I mean, I've heard Conor McGregor say that.  I've seen so many people believe this stuff.  And basically what it is, it is... Let me just read this statement to you.  I think it's a great statement.  Basically, this whole... the law of attraction idea, is the idea that we have faith in faith and the erroneous idea that we can create our reality by the creative power of our spoken word.  These Bethel people, if you ever listen to their music, every now and then they'll stop and they'll say, prophesy over it, speak it, speak it, speak it, and prophesy, prophesy, prophesy.  If you prophesy, it shall be so.  And basically it's name it, claim it, blab it, grab it.  That's what they believe.  They believe, oh God, I'm going to be a millionaire.  I'm going to speak these words into existence.  The words give life.  And this is horrendously bad interpretations of Scripture.  And let me just read the rest of this thing here.  It says, Only the Lord God is the creator of positive thinking.  Positive thinking lets man think he can be in control and create as he pleases, be it wealth, health, or happiness, and it bypasses God altogether.  I thought that was a great statement somebody wrote online.  These people are wild charismatics.  And they believe that if you just say it enough, if you just believe it hard enough, then it can happen.  And that's not how faith works.  That's not how God works.  This child is not going to be raised from the dead.  I'm sorry.  This family needs to go home and grieve and heal.  I just can't believe that Bethel Church And Bill Johnson would allow this family to do this.  I'm appalled.  I don't know if it's possible to experience every emotion at the same time, but I basically am.  I just feel horrible about this.  This is sick.  But I want to say this to you, church, that... My point in this channel, a lot of things I'm dealing with, I'm dealing with the music, I'm dealing with the two veins of Christianity.  One is Bible-living Christianity, the other is just a false Eastern religion pretending to be Christianity.  That's my message here in this channel.  I'm going to delve deeper into that and the nuts and bolts as to why that is the way that it is.  But I want to say this to you, ladies and gentlemen.  Stop looking at just the music.  A lot of people are just putting blinders on and say, well, I like the music.  Well, you need to take the blinders off and you look at the big picture.  And here's a fantastic example of how ugly this beast is.  This is a monster of a religion.  This is a false, wicked as the devil religion.  This is a horrible, horrible institution feigning Christianity.  I don't even know how much more I can say negative about this stuff.  The doctrine is bad.  The spirit is bad.  The fruit is bad.  Everything about this from top to bottom is rotten.  And you need to know that.  And stop saying, well, judge not.  You better judge.  You better judge.  Because this is your soul.  This is your life.  And a lot of people, it's like when you go fishing, they put that hook out there, and that fish, he just sees what's on that hook and bites that hook, and they take it.  Especially young people that are watching my videos out there, you see this beautiful esoteric hypnotic music where it's this beautiful crystalline voices like Kerry Jobe and even Lauren Daigle, and you get enchanted with that.  You're not blessed by that.  The Holy Spirit's not moving your heart on that.  You are being enchanted by that.  Key word, enchanted.  That is an esoteric word, meaning that you are brought into a state of delirium where you're literally possessed by this stuff.  And that's not the Holy Ghost.  And that stuff's going to pull you like a fish out of water into a rotten religion.  And it could very well cost you your soul.  So ladies and gentlemen, I'm filled with emotion when I see this.  I just can't believe that.  I can't believe this.  I really can't.  But this ugly monster of a religion.  I want you to take a look at it here.  Take a look.  This is horrible.  And those people really, they believe that if they worship and dance enough, and they get into a big enough tizzy, that God will resurrect that child.  I don't even know what to say.  This is horrible stuff.  Horrible stuff.  And I think it's time that every now and then, I think we need to look at this ugly... Just look at the monster.  Look at it.  It's a monster.  It's sick.  It's sick.  And I think you need to see that.  So, ladies and gentlemen, we love you.  We love truth.  We love people.  I want to see people get saved and come out of this stuff.  I wish you guys could see the emails I get.  I really do.  I wish you could see the emails and the criticism I get.  Because... I'm pointing out this stuff saying, no, this is wrong.  You know, this here Bible, Bethel Church and Hillsong and this Bible are not the same thing.  And you'd think I was a criminal for saying that.  But we love people.  And I want folks to know Christ.  And that's why we do these videos.  So ladies and gentlemen, pray for me.  Just pray for me.  Pray for me.  I don't even know what to do with this.  I don't even know what to say to you anymore.  Just pray for me, please.  Look, we love you guys.  Please get out of this stuff.  I'm begging you.  If you're in a church that believes like this, get out.  Please, I beg you, get out of this stuff.  This is sick.  This is heresy.  This is not Bible Christianity.  And I love you enough to tell you.  I guess we'll just end the video there.  Have a good night. ",
