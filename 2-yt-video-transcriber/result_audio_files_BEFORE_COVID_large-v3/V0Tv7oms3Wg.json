            "text": "shalom israel.  it's your boy new breed aka brother emmanuel coming through with another video.  in this particular video i would like to talk about why targeted individuals absolutely must stay away from narcissists.  ti's gotta stay away from narcissists.  and um.  A lot of people speak about people with narcissistic behaviors but they don't really go into detail and examine some of these behaviors because once you examine a lot of narcissistic behaviors you'll find out that targeted individuals are literally the opposite of a narcissist.  You're talking about people who have been targeted from the rest of society based on being different, based on thinking outside of the box, whether it be religious differences, cultural differences, or just social differences.  But you're talking about people who have drawn outside of the lines and basically marched to a beat of their own drum and decided that they're not going to be cold-hearted like the rest of the world, that they're going to be empathetic that they're gonna walk a line of truth opposed to dwelling in wickedness and following the status quo.  When you think about what a targeted individual is, a person who has been internet mobbed, work mobbed, gang stalked, basically been an outcast, When you think about these particular people and the strength and courage that it takes to maintain sanity during those type of perilous times and then you think about what a narcissist really is, you'll find out why it's so very important for targeted individuals to stay very far away from narcissism.  See, A person who exhibits narcissistic behavior is absolutely poisonous and toxic to a targeted individual.  That person can cost a targeted individual their lives.  So this video is the great importance to those who are suffering those specific perils that I was speaking of.  This video is for those who are battling and dealing with those type of people in their everyday circle and why it's so very important to get those people out of your lives.  First off, let's identify some of the traits of a narcissistic person.  First, you got to understand that Being a narcissist is a personality disorder.  That is literally a mental health problem.  Now, a lot of people in modern day science, they like to call mental health problems.  They like to call them diseases.  In actuality, it's demon possession.  All mental health problems are demon possession, ladies and gentlemen.  Anytime a person is diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, so on and so forth, that means that person has a demon.  If we were living in Christ's time, it wouldn't be no such thing as these diagnosis that these doctors give.  They would just be pronounced as demon possessed and the prophets would remove those spirits from those people.  These people who have narcissist behavior, it is a disorder, a mental health problem, a demon.  Only a demon will make it so.  a person cannot see the wrong in what they do.  Only a demon can only see, can shield a person's eyes to the facts that they're not perfect, that they're not the only ones who suffer and they're not the only ones in life who have goals and ambitions.  Only a demon can shield a person in that way and enable them to be evil, wicked in a continuous pattern.  So why is that number one?  Why is that so toxic to one who is a targeted individual?  Well, you got to understand first and foremost that targeting individuals are the complete opposite.  We're very self-reflecting.  TIs examine themselves a lot.  They critique themselves a lot.  Some of the times to the point where it makes them, I would say, unconfident.  And that's the negative part.  Because they want to be so perfect and just not tread over people and not harm anyone when in actuality you got to be bold as a lion and the bible says cry aloud spare not.  but a lot of targeted individuals they want to walk on tiptoes and they want to try not to offend anybody.  That's a trait of empathy.  That's when empathy is overcoming you.  So it's a line that you have to draw between being too empathetic as a targeted individual.  Because a person who is a narcissist, they will run all over that.  They will eat you alive when they find out that you're so empathetic that you leave a path open for them to be leeches, vampires, and bloodsuckers.  So you can't leave that door open.  You can't be but so empathetic.  A lot of narcissists are very arrogant.  Arrogance is ignorance, ladies and gentlemen.  An ignorant person does volatile actions and they do things that can cause you calamity pain.  In a previous broadcast, I spoke about choosing your friends very wisely.  You don't want to surround yourself with arrogant people.  You want people who are as humble and operating in the spirit of humility like you are.  Since mankind during these societal changes have evolved to being worshipers and lovers of themselves, it's very hard as a TI to maintain real relationships and friendships with a lot of people.  But you got to know that you got to stand clear of those arrogant people because arrogant people are volatile people.  These narcissists always need admiration.  Always need admiration.  That's why as a targeted individual, you have to have a part of you that does not care about what people think.  Because unlike the world, We can't care what people think because we're going to represent truth regardless.  People who seek admiration are deceivers.  People who seek admiration will continue to do things for attention.  They'll go through great lengths for attention.  They'll jump leaps and bounds.  Now, a person who is a TI, the reason why you can't care what people think, the reason why you can't care about admiration and seeking these kind of things is because whether people love you or hate you, you got to represent the truth.  That's why when people get caught up in giving me compliments, no matter what it's regarding, I take it for a grain of salt.  I really, you know, thank you, I appreciate it.  But it's taken for a grain of salt because One minute people love you, the next minute people will hate you.  That's the nature of most people these days.  So with that being known, with that being a known fact, I can take the good and the bad and throw it in the same pot almost.  Long as I know that I'm representing truth, it doesn't matter.  And that's the mentality we got to have.  Narcissists are manipulative.  It is a demon of manipulation in them.  With you being so empathetic, they want to manipulate you.  They want to play at your heartstrings.  They want to do whatever they can.  They like to use guilt against you.  Oh yeah, these bloodsuckers love to use guilt in order to keep you at a low standard, in order to keep you suppressed.  A lot of us brothers and sisters who become targeted individuals were not always targeted individuals.  Some of us were born into this lifestyle of being targeted because of some of the families we were born into.  and the most high was shining light on us through birth.  And some of us had to learn things the hard way, go through things in these streets, find out heartaches and pains the hard way in life.  And we wasn't always perfect.  We done things in these streets, we done things out in the world.  And the people who are supposed to uplift you and be there, are in fact narcissistic a lot of the times.  So, what they'll do is they'll use guilt and manipulation to keep you lost.  That will be literally one of the most damaging things for you as a targeted individual to be around.  people who are manipulative, who are controlling, who are always patronizing and demanding things from you.  Everybody is a critic, right?  It's almost like our lives is like the Truman Show.  You got all these people just watching and criticizing.  How many people's helping?  Watching, criticizing, but are they helping?  All of these traits that these narcissists produce will hold you back.  if you're around them.  It can even stop you from your growth and development and it can end your life being around these people.  That's why we make it aware.  We promote an awareness about these narcissists.  And the number one thing about it is they're demons.  They're blinded.  They cannot see that they can continually do someone wrong.  They can continually do evil.  They could continually lie, manipulate, and they could do this and sleep just fine at night because they have a demon in them.  They are possessed.  Ladies and gentlemen, that person is no longer your girlfriend or no longer your boyfriend no longer this family member or that family member.  that person is a demon possessed narcissist and i'm not saying anybody in particular but you all know who that person is in your lives.  you all know that these people are in your lives.  so targeted individuals must avoid narcissists at all costs.  I mean, these are absolutely the people you must avoid.  And you know, you got gang stalkers out there.  Gang stalkers are just low level.  And I say they're low level because a lot of them are getting paid Walmart gift cards to follow you on the freeway.  A lot of them are just following you through grocery stores.  A lot of them are blindly being riddled with spirits and most of them are strangers.  So they're just leading.  They're just going wherever the spirits lead them.  A lot of them are just low-level masons who are out there to watch people and get their little rank in the lodge.  But the ones you really need to look out for The real enemies you need to be watching out for are the ones in your own circle.  The narcissist.  Those are the ones that can cost you your life.  Those are the ones at the end when everything hits the fan are the ones that are going to really do you in.  You can be laying next to one.  You can be best friends with one.  Bottom line is, watch those close to you, ladies and gentlemen.  And I'm not saying this to make you look at everybody with the side eye.  I'm just simply stating, if you know within your heart of hearts, deep down in your spirit, that you got people around you that don't have your best interests in mind, and you know you've been through things in life and you're aware and your and your mind is open that the spiritual realm is manifesting that the most high is working in your life.  don't be around nobody who gonna hold you back.  don't be around nobody who can cost you your life when you know that you're somebody special that you're chosen that you're the elect.  so If this video helped you out, make sure you hit that share button.  Thank you for viewing.  Shalom and peace. ",
