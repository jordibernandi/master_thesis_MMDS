            "text": "Attention YouTube, here we go.  Being a YouTuber is a dream job for lots of young people.  But two years ago YouTube turned the dream job into a nightmare.  The real YouTubers that are the reason for YouTube's big success are getting censored, deleted, erased and hidden.  Making a living on YouTube is actually no longer possible.  Many channels have entirely disappeared or are now reduced to a minimum.  There is no job security.  It seems like YouTube doesn't want independent YouTubers anymore.  Because now YouTube prefers like channels run by TV stations or Hollywood celebrities.  And for those guys completely different rules apply.  They won't be censored, they won't be erased, they won't be kicked out.  YouTube is actually pushing these guys with everything they have.  All this happens simply out of greed for profit, simply because advertisers prefer Will Smith over the independent YouTuber.  But YouTube should not be so sure about that strategy.  Since one year we have the YouTubers Union and we have thousands of YouTubers that are now united and picked up the fight.  The only problem is that so far we haven't been able to achieve much.  But exactly that is going to change now.  IG Metal, the largest independent trade union on the planet and the YouTubers Union are now joining forces with the clear goal to bring back the old YouTube.  We have founded the joint venture FairTube.  And now time will change for YouTube, since we have 125 years of experience in the fight against injustice.  and over 2 million members plus superb lawyers are now joining forces with thousands of YouTubers who are really unhappy with the way things go.  Together I think we are completely unbeatable.  FairTube is unbeatable.  We want YouTube to actually perform massive changes on their strategy for the benefit of the creators and for the benefit of the entire platform.  And in this video we're going to explain to you how we will achieve it and at the same time we're asking for your support.  Hello everybody, I'm J\u00f6rg Sprave, founder of the YouTubers Union and we're here in the 15th floor of the IG Metal building in Frankfurt and I'm here with Christiane Benner.  Hello Christiane.  Hello J\u00f6rg.  What is your job at the IG Metal? ",

Actually, the IG Metal deals with crowd workers and the working condition of crowd workers and has been doing so for several years.  And that of course also includes YouTubers.
