            "text": "Today we're at Millersville University against abortion.  Last time we came, it was really intense.  Yeah, we're already getting support.  We heard a couple honks.  Looks like a very busy day on the campus.  Oh, it's going to be windy.  Yep, definitely a discontented person hanging around there.  Just ripped up our flyer.  We haven't even set up for 30 seconds yet.  Oh gosh, it's so windy.  The wind is so strong, it's ripping our banner.  I wasn't sure about that one, was I?  This young man has recently had pneumonia, but he's going to try and stick it out.  Are you playing me for breakfast, baby?  Listen, 58 million dead.  Does that mean anything to you?  I'm not even born yet.  Yeah, yeah, son.  I'd come out here and stand with you myself if I wasn't really late for work.  But I just want to say thank you guys.  It's really awesome.  I remember last year when there were people on the other side of the street screaming, yelling at you.  And I came, I saw videos of it, and I came down to stand over with you because they're yelling at you because they're all men.  And I wanted to be a woman standing with you, but then everyone's gone.  I'm super late for work, but like I said, I'd stand out here with you.  But I just want to say it's awesome what you guys are doing.  Thank you so much.  Thank you for watching, of course.  Think about the circumstances where women may need an abortion.  What about rape?  What about individuals who are held against their will?  What about the individuals that are born of rape?  What about the individuals that are born of rape?  I understand the individuals that are born of rape.  Are they less human?  No, that they're not less human.  So why should we abort them, man?  You just spit at us.  Yeah, I did.  Why'd you spit at us?  I, uh... I don't agree with you.  Okay.  Take a good long look.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Well, you guys don't seem to care for a woman's right, so I'm going to spit at your feet.  What about the baby's right?  Okay, well, you just spat on us, so... Would you like us to call the police?  For spitting at you?  That's considered assault.  Spitting on somebody is considered assault.  Did I hit anyone over there?  Looks like I spit on the ground.  You were trying to spit.  You were spitting at us.  I didn't try so much as did.  You did, and that's considered assault.  Let's go talk to the police.  Yeah, I got time.  You want to?  Yeah, I got time.  Come with me.  Yeah.  What's your problem today, bud?  I just don't agree with white guys with red sashes, that's all.  Did he spit on you?  Yeah.  Spit on the ground from here, then.  Turn around.  I wanted my Monday to go, but... Dude, you can enforce your opinion, but you can't be spitting on people.  They don't like it when you spit on them.  I wonder why.  I'm an opinionated guy.  I'm pro-choice.  Take a good long look, buddy.  Both sides to the argument.  Is this tolerance?  Yeah, it is.  Really?  Yeah, it is.  Goes both ways, my friend.  Goes both ways.  Did we spit at you?  Yeah, sure.  We didn't spit at you.  I got some nice boots here.  You want to take a shot?  Go ahead.  This shows you what the pro-abortion side believes.  They think they can just come here and spit on us.  A week ago, I was researching for an abortion debate, and I found your videos on YouTube, and I was just thinking about you, and I was driving down the street, and you guys are right here, and I was like, hey, there they are, okay.  Finally, we have a counter-protester.  One.  Actually, no, there's another one there, too.  Freedom is choice, and my body, my choice.  Well, that's original.  What do you think of when the baby has a heartbeat in the womb?  Would you be okay with letting it live?  I'm not gonna answer anything.  Okay, what do you think?  Uh, you really have no opinion on that.  Well, if it has a heartbeat, would you be willing to let it live?  Is that logical enough?  Would you?  No, no, I'm asking you, what do you think?  I have, twice.  I'm saying I did, two times.  I have two children.  I'm not sure if you've experienced it, but it's really hard to be pregnant.  I think that at least if it's a heartbeat, we should let it live, right?  Look, if you don't have a uterus, you really shouldn't have the opinion on the matter.  It's not your body, it's not your life.  You haven't been pregnant, I assume.  Wait, he doesn't have a uterus.  Actually, I do.  I'm transgender.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's a whole other question.  So you think that he biologically has a uterus?  You think that?  I do.  You think that he biologically has a uterus?  If he has said so, yes.  If he says so.  So if I say that I'm a Ferrari, I become a Ferrari?  And it's been very windy, so windy that the banner split in three places.  We'll just switch the signs and flyers.  And we also had people ripping up flyers in our faces.  There's one.  Here's another one.  Who did this?  I did that.  Why'd you tear up the flyer?  Because it's unneeded.  Oh, that's tolerant.  Murder is never right.  I don't know.  I believe that.  I'm always going to be pro-life.  But I also know if I was ever put in that situation, I'm going to be pro-choice first.  You agree that the murder of a child is wrong.  It's not black and white.  It's not so black and white.  And she's saying this because she's a female.  We are females.  So this is why we are saying our answers are not definitive black and white.  As you as a male are saying, murder is wrong.  Abortion is murder.  She may be agreeing with you, but as a woman, whether or not she's put in that situation, her decision is always going to change because things always change.  Morality does not change.  I'm a person where my morality is changing and I can say for sure that I'm sorry.  Murder can never be correct.  Thank you guys.  What is he yelling?  Anyway, I hope that shows you something of the pro-abortion movement and about the pro-life movement.  We will not back down.  Doesn't matter what happens.  Doesn't matter if our banner rips in half or someone spits at us.  We're going to keep moving.  God bless.  Thank you for watching. ",
