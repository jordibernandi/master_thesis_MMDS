            "text": "So I said that I would be making some videos about some verses that, you know, really changed my outlook, some verses that really had an impact on me over the years since I've become a Christian.  And so I'm going to do that.  I'm going to start that today.  These are in no particular order.  And one of the things I will say up front is that this is a moving target, right?  Like, you know, when you ask somebody what their top 10 favorite verses are, it really depends on the season of life and what's going on, the context, and things changes all the time.  So, but these are the things that come to mind, you know, sort of immediately when I think of the verses that have kind of changed my perspective on things.  And one thing you'll notice, and I think you'll see this today, this is not going to be a standard.  These are my top 10 favorite verses.  They're not really my favorite verses.  They're not like my life verses or inspiring, really.  I mean, maybe some of them will be, but that's not really what I mean.  I mean, these are the things that when I read them and I understood them, it really changed my outlook.  I think you'll see what I mean in a second.  Also, I'll try to connect everything to social justice because that's what I do.  All right, the first verse or section of verses that changed my perspective on things is Leviticus chapter 27, starting in verse 1, and probably eight verses, right?  You'll read them.  Leviticus chapter 27, starting in verse 1.  These are the words of God.  It says, If the person is from 5 years old up to 20 years old, the valuation shall be for a male 20 shekels and for a female 10 shekels.  If the person is from a month old up to 5 years old, the valuation shall be for a male 5 shekels of silver and for a female the valuation shall be 3 shekels of silver.  And if the person is sixty years old or over, the valuation for a male shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.  And if someone is too poor to pay the valuation, then he shall be made to stand before the priest, and the priest shall value him, and the priest shall value him according to what the vower can afford.  Okay, so that's the section of verses, Leviticus chapter 27.  And the context of me reading this verse, I remember it very clearly.  Now, when I became a Christian, the first thing I did was I started to read the Bible, and I read the whole Bible in a very short amount of time.  Um, and so I read this, but I never really considered it.  because, you know, I mean, if you've had this experience like I have, like you, you start reading the Bible and Genesis is great and you know, you're, you're getting through it, you're zipping through it like a novel or something like that.  And then you get to Exodus and it's also good.  And then you start to get into the law and you just, your mind starts to go to sleep.  And this is, this is, this is how kind of it happened to me too.  I was trying to stay, I mean, not stay awake, but I was trying to pay attention, but some of it is so that it's hard to do that.  I mean, I'm just being honest.  I'm not trying to be blasphemous or anything like that.  It's just hard.  These laws are very out of context with my everyday life, and so it's hard to do.  So I had read this, but I never really considered it too much.  But when I considered it, and this section of verse has changed my life, is when I heard some atheists make some arguments based on this section of verses.  Now, I don't remember where I heard this first.  It was probably, I mean, it was just a typical village atheist type, someone who thinks they're very smart, but they're really not that smart.  And I used to fear arguing with people like this, by the way.  This is true.  I used to fear the arguments of Richard Dawkins.  Ooh, all those guys.  I used to fear.  I don't anymore, obviously.  But anyway, from one of those types, a village atheist type, not a very thoughtful kind of atheist.  And I'm going to read it from the Skeptics Annotated Bible.  This is the basic argument.  This is what they say.  This is their annotation about this section of verses.  It says, God defines the value of human life in dollars and cents.  Of course, to God, females are worth considerably less than males, between 50 and 60% less, but neither are worth very much.  And it's referring to this section of verses where it says that this is the valuation of persons.  And every single time, no matter if it's an old person, a middle-aged person, a child, whatever the person is, the woman is valued about 50 to 60% less than the male.  Okay, so I read that and I was like, yeah, that's interesting.  Kind of certainly seems to be about that.  And so I read this and I thought about it long and hard and I did a little bit of digging.  It's helpful to look at commentaries about what this is all about because again, we're pretty divorced from this context.  This idea of vowing to the Lord and things like that, it's just something that we're not really familiar with.  We don't do this too much anymore.  But it struck me instantly.  I mean, I wasn't a scholar, but it struck me instantly that this is about a special case, making a vow to the Lord.  And I didn't understand what that was.  And so I knew that the interpretation of this was dependent on what that's all about.  So the atheist thinks about this deeply about it and says, we'll see.  God thinks women are worthless.  You know, like... I mean, idiotic, very, very, very, very surface level, very superficial reading.  But I knew as soon as I read this, that whatever this means, it has to do with the vow.  What is the vow?  And, you know, without getting too deep into it, and there's a little bit of debate about this, of course, just like there's a debate about everything.  But what's going on here is not, obviously not what the skeptics annotated Bible thinks is going on here.  You really have to work at misunderstanding this, or just be illiterate, or just have an agenda, which is what the Skeptics Annotated Bible does.  So here's what's going on here.  So if you make a vow to the Lord, Um, you have to keep it.  You know what I mean?  Like you just have to keep it.  That's how it was back then.  If you don't keep the vow to the Lord, then you've got problems.  You know, it's not, it's not like when, when, when people today say to God, well, I'll do this, you know, if you do this and then, then they don't do it and nothing happens to them.  It's not like that.  This was a serious matter.  Your word was, was a serious thing.  And so if you didn't do it, then you have a problem now.  And this valuation here is the redemption price of that vow.  The redemption price.  And so what happens when you break your vow to the Lord?  What happens if you would want to be released from the vow or whatever it is?  How do we adjudicate that?  What's the consequence there?  Because there is a consequence.  This is biblical justice.  And so the valuation is more for a male than for a woman.  It's not about the value of the person.  It's about how much they owe if they don't keep their vow.  It's the redemption cost.  So the fact that women have a lower redemption cost, the atheist idiot who doesn't understand anything says, well, see, that means a woman is worth less.  No, that means the penalty is less for a woman.  Why do you think the penalty might be less for a woman?  I mean, you might not like it, but in their culture back then, the male had a lot more earning potential than the female.  The male was capable of earning more than the female.  So are you really arguing that it would have been a good idea to have the redemption cost of the vow, of the making of a special vow to the Lord, be the same for males and females in a culture where a female had less earning potential?  Would that not have actually been a punishment to the female?  You see, here's the thing.  This is why this verse impacted me.  Once I realized what was going on here, I realized how superficial most people's understanding of the Bible is.  Very superficial, very stupid surface level.  And if you don't look into it and you just kind of take the atheist's word for it or the person who's presenting this ridiculous argument's word for it, you might come away thinking God's law is ridiculous.  God's law doesn't make any sense.  When it's the exact opposite.  This person is saying that this law says something that is basically the opposite of what it says.  It's not about valuing people.  It's about being fair to each person based on what their earning potential was, based on what their characteristics are.  If you notice, the valuation of old people is less.  Does the Bible really hold old people in lower esteem than young people?  No.  But their earning potential is less.  It's a reality.  When you get older, you have less earning potential in general.  Valuation of a child.  Is the argument really that the Bible doesn't value children?  No.  But the child can't make money on their own.  So obviously they shouldn't have to pay the same.  You see what I'm saying?  So this first changed my life because it made me realize that the depth that a lot of people understand the Bible is like a millimeter.  And so all you got to do is a little bit of digging.  And a lot of these problems, these so-called problems that atheists have and unbelievers have, they go away.  And this is related to social justice because a lot of people are talking about justice right now, but they have no clue what it is.  They can say the word.  They can say love.  They can say justice.  They can say love your neighbor.  But when it comes down to their beliefs, Their theology of what these words actually mean, what this looks like in practice, it's very, very shallow.  So Leviticus 27, this is one of the verses that changed my life.  I hope this was helpful, and I hope you enjoy the rest of this series as we continue 10 verses that changed my life. ",
