            "text": "Hey MGTOs, this is Vention.  I just managed to get about 40% into a video where this woman is having a rant about MGTOs.  Oh man, I had a cold a while ago and I still got that crud in my lungs.  And man, we got some allergens, serious allergies going.  And if it wasn't for that Flonase, this stuff right here, man, I would be screwed.  You can probably see it in my eyes.  But if I didn't have that stuff, man, I'd be sneezing.  It would just be horrible.  But I can get by if I have that stuff.  But anyway, it was... I had... She was ranting pretty good, but I finally got bored with her.  She's arguing with our understanding that men are the prize.  And she's saying that we are not the prize.  And I beg to differ.  We are the ones who earn just... We have tremendous productive capacity.  We earn more because we work more.  And... And we don't need the living standard that they just seem to need.  I live on just a fraction of my income, but I'm not a good average because I've been a MGTO for like 22 years.  So the benefits of MGTO, I've had time to stack up hardcore.  So, but in any case, even like a 20-year-old MGTO is just, it's just better.  He's just better off.  She also says, MGTO is just a coping mechanism.  And on that one, I'm going to have to give it to her.  She is correct, in my opinion.  because feminism has made women so toxic and the, and the me too movement, a woman can like have sex with you, then revoke position, uh, permission weeks later.  Um, and she, and then of course the divorce rate and the, uh, and the fact that men always lose in divorce court.  Um, so MGTO is a way that we can have a good life and still, uh, You know, all we have to do is just kind of keep our distance from women and don't invest in them.  And then we can have a good life.  And all of our productivity is then... is then held within our own life, and it grows and multiplies, and investments grow, and our learning, our ability to learn about economics and various very useful things just grows and grows.  And until we can develop as people... vastly better than a married guy.  I mean, they develop in some ways because of the ability to withstand the agony of living with a woman for so long.  That makes you really tough, you know, but as far as growing and developing and learning and studying what you want and having time to do what you want, it's just an amazing thing.  She goes on about, how are you going to get sex?  And the thing is, a lot of us don't.  But then again, a lot of married guys don't get sex either.  A lot of married guys don't get sex.  For example... When we had all of our overtime from snow schedule, we had like, we were running around chaining up trucks and working mandatory 12s and six days a week.  And man, I was hammered.  But man, the overtime was just amazing.  And then we got our paychecks, right?  And I looked at my paycheck, and I looked around and smiled to all the married guys.  I said, wow, what are you going to do with all your money?  And they went, oh, bills.  And, of course, I said, well, oh, yeah, you're married.  Well, at least you can get laid whenever you want.  And everybody in the room went, oh.  Yeah.  Because that is definitely not true.  So, how are you going to get sex?  Man, I don't care if I ever get sex again.  Maybe when I go to Mexico, I might date, but man, I really don't know.  It's not that big a deal.  And she says, y'all want women, right?  Well, in my experience, you know, over like 30 years of dating... Women increase my stress levels, they drain my wallet, and they don't really give anything really seriously valuable in return.  It's all about pleasing them, and it's like you have to be like a clown and an entertainer and a chauffeur, and you have to pay for everything, and it's just this whole... thing that it's just not worth it.  overall when i interact with women or date women or have a girlfriend i am less happy and more stressed out and a lot more poor than i am if i'm not dating.  so um and she was she's talking about migto doesn't?  it doesn't solve the problem.  it's just it.  just it just papers over the problem or some shit like that.  and and I disagree.  When I don't have women in my life, I am happy.  And when I do have women in my life, I am less happy.  So women, MGTO isn't really a coping mechanism.  Ghosting, you know, being a MGTO monk, you know, it's an improvement on my life.  It improves the fact that women and the absence of women from my life is an improvement on my life.  It took me a while to figure that out, but it is impossible to ignore now.  A woman would have to really be convincing in order to get me to spend any time with her.  She says that we want women to approach us and pay for dinners, and I don't really.  I really don't.  I don't really care.  And basically, that's about what it would take to get me to go out with a woman, but really would not be terribly enthusiastic about that either.  and so and she's just like she's just like furious and resentful and and it's kind of amusing to to listen to I'm.  I might answer her in fact.  I might just drop a link to this video.  The reason why a lot of guys are MGTO is because our lives are better without you.  And don't get married. ",
