Well, first of all, nice haircut.  Second of all, I believe in the globe, but I also believe that up and down exist.  So can you elaborate a little bit more, please?  Because if you're underneath the globe, you can't be upside down if you're right side up.  So I'll just prove it now, yeah?  Right.  Look, to be honest, I've no idea what you're talking about, but please don't let me stop you.  Off you go.  There you go.  Boom.  That's up and down.  Peace.  I really have missed Flat Earth Science.  Goose, goose, go!  Hello and welcome back to Conspiracy Cats.  Now today we're going to be looking at a lot of stuff that I've missed since I've been away.  But before we get to that point, a lot of you have been asking me, where have I actually been?  Now the answer is quite boring and I have detailed that in the description.  But if you don't want to read that, all you need to know is I've finished my course of antibiotics, everything's cleared up now and I'm fine.  And if you create your own first part to that story, it's going to be a lot more entertaining than the truth.  Anyway, what have I missed?  Ah, Eric DeBay, the king of Flat Earth, has released his own rap song.  It's brilliant.  Here's all the best bits now.  Catchy stuff.  I'm sure you'll agree.  Now, this has prompted a string of Flat Earth artists to bring out their own rap tracks.  Most notably, our old friend, Quantum Eraser.  He doesn't like me much.  But Quantum Eraser isn't rapping about the shape of the Earth.  Quantum Eraser seems to be rapping about something he's lost down the toilet.  You heard this before!  What?!  What?  What?  What?  Conspiracy cats.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Where's my number two?  Now, I'll be honest, I don't know where his number two is, but energy healer Mark Bioski does have some advice for the person who has taken it.  Go on, Mark.  If you've got a partner, or if you've got children, place it in their bedrooms.  Yeah, definitely.  Great advice.  Anyway, time for the worst flat earth proof of the week.  Time for the worst flat earth proof of the week.  Hello.  So this week we have a new flat earther on the scene.  So let's see if we can surprise him by sneaking up on him and watching him without him knowing. ",

Now, I decided to see what would happen if I could combine all of those three into one.  And this was the result.  Yellow belly coward You always doing so stupid videos.

Ra-a-a-a-a-a-a Ra-a-a-a-a-a-a-a And that song will be going up in its entirety on the Conspiracy Cat's third channel, which is linked in the description.  Your videos are amazing.  Oh, thanks, guys.  So are yours.  You know, just for very different reasons.  For those of you who don't know my good friends Peter and Pete, they make some amazing educational videos, and they've been dropping some serious knowledge bombs in the time I've been gone.  Let's see what I've been missing out on.  Well, apparently all this time I've been wrong to believe that iron is an element, because it isn't.  But I've also been wrong to believe that salt isn't an element, because it is.  And I've also been totally stupid not to understand that clouds are made out of the element that is salt.  Now, we will be seeing more of Peter and Pete soon on the BaldiCats channel, but this video isn't about them.  It's about one man, one flat earther who needs no introduction.  So here's his introduction.  These are the adventures of... Ranty the Flat Earther.  As he explores the strange world known to Fraggles as... The Globe.

So looking at the video, I can see that he's filmed this from the Mirabal in Blackpool.  And he's probably looking for the Welsh mountains that he regularly films from there.  So I donned my cape and I went to help.  So here I am at the Mirabal in Blackpool.  I think just in the distance you can make out Ranty Flat Earth.  Still looking for his mountains.  Let's go and see if we can help him find them.  Well, in the end, Ranty wouldn't speak to me.  It turned out he was too busy looking for the sea, because he'd lost that as well.  So I went looking on my own.  Well... They're not under here.  Now, they certainly were well hidden, and despite this close call, I came back empty-handed. ",

My friend Randy has lost some mountains.  Have you seen the mirror right over there out of my window?  Yeah, it appears the mountains hadn't got up and run away at all.  They were just there all along.  And it took Randy a 30 minute live stream to finally get an explanation for why he couldn't see them.  And when he finally got that explanation, he was over the moon.
