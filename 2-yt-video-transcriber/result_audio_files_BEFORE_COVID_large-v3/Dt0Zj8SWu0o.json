            "text": "And so, in the book of Matthew, chapter 24, verse 6, it says this, And ye shall hear of wars, and rumours of wars.  See that ye be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.  So, These wars and rumors of wars is the time period that we're living in.  Because unfortunately, the Caucasian, he established his rule through war.  And the destruction of other people.  What does the book say?  It says, as you have done, so shall it be done.  So his power... will be broken completely in war.  And the wars and the rumors of wars are based on his thrashing around trying to remain in power where his power is waning and finished and others now are resisting his imposition on them.  Hence why you have these wars and rumours of wars.  It is very important, beloved family, that we contextualise the current news cycle where on Friday the 3rd of January 2020 Donald Trump ordered the assassination of a Major General in the Iranian Quds Force.  A man who is a sovereign of another nation.  And despite all the slanderous things that you are now hearing in the news about the man... There is no evidence to substantiate the slander and the justification for his murder.  This is outright murder.  Assassination of a major general in a sovereign nation's administration.  within the confines of another sovereign nation where they had no permission from the Iraqis.  and in fact when they murdered Sulaimani they also murdered Abu Mahdi who is the deputy leader of a major and significant military movement within Iraq.  and by the way it wasn't just the two.  they killed many other people in that strike.  but you know with the Caucasian his life is so valuable in his own eyes.  but the lives of other people are less so.  And so they can literally talk about other people who were murdered within that airstrike as collateral damage.  As if they don't matter.  As if the people who were murdered didn't have mothers.  Didn't have husbands.  Didn't have wives.  Didn't have children.  But this is the casual and careless nature of of this type of foreign policy where you believe that you have the right to go into other sovereign nations and murder people and declare it to the world and by the way those are the ones they declare to the world.  brothers and sisters according to some reports that I've read The Shia Muslims in the region, in Iran and in other parts of that region, are angry and are in mourning.  And they are threatening revenge.  According to reports, Saudi Arabia and many of the Sunni Arab Gulf states are celebrated.  I just want you to think now.  See, because the enemy's mode of operation, his modus operandi has always been divide and rule.  And from the time Donald J. Trump took office, He has been about the business of siding with Sunni Islam against Shia Islam.  And he has made that a significant plank of his administration in vilifying Iran and lording Saudi.  And that's why Saudi Arabia, for instance, has been given all of the arms that it's been given in its destruction of Yemen and the Yemeni people.  And many of those in the Yemen, of course, are Shia Muslims.  And so what you have taking place in Syria, and in other parts of the so-called Middle East are a lot of proxy wars between America, Russia, they're all involved, America, Russia, China, Britain, they're all in there.  Everybody vying for control and power, and of course, don't ever forget the oil.  and other resources found in that particular region.  According to some other reports, Netanyahu and Israel are said to be happy at the escalation in tension between America and Iran.  Because Israel has made it clear that they would like to see the Iranian so-called regime destroyed or changed.  And so regime change is something that has been muted for many years as far as the Iranian government is concerned.  And it would appear that it's possible that this is now one of the first salvos in the next attack, the next major attack to take place in the so-called Middle East.  According to Donald Trump, he said in Washington recently, since the assassination, that he and his administration would target 52 Iranian sites if Tehran attacks Americans or US assets in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani.  Let me tell you something, beloved.  You're looking at just pure gangsterism.  Here's a man who goes in, murders somebody in their own region and territory, by the way, and then threatens that if you try to retaliate, We've already identified another 52 sites within your own nation.  Because this is clearly now to escalate.  Because they've calculated that they have the way with all to destroy the Iranian people, the Iranian military and the Iranian people.  In my humble opinion, that is a miscalculation.  And America has been miscalculating since Vietnam.  And the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan recently warned Donald J. Trump and the Americans to leave Iran alone.  Because the Iranians are not lightweight Muslims.  They're not even Arabs.  These are Caucasians who are Muslim who don't play.  And so in conclusion, beloved family, I want to end like this and say to you that don't get distracted by these wars and rumors of wars.  Don't let that be your focus.  By all means, look at what's been said.  But I humbly suggest to you that your focus should be on you.  Your focus should be on us.  Your focus should be to have a vision for where black people are gonna be as we go deeper into the 21st century.  Your focus should be on developing and cultivating your family.  Your focus should be devoted to the unity of our people.  And we should be working 24 hours, 7 days a week to bring about a greater unity of black people.  Because understand this.  The enemy is going to get desperate.  When it all starts going wrong for him.  And let me explain to you what I mean by that.  And by the way.  The most honorable Elijah Muhammad said that.  Britain.  Is going to betray America.  And the talk already is.  They're waiting for Boris to return from holiday in the Caribbean.  Because they want to hear what Boris has to say.  They want to see whether Boris is going to stand four square feet.  with his counterpart, Mr.  Trump, and back the assassination and the aggression towards Iran, or whether Boris is going to adopt a more so-called conciliatory posture and try to position Britain as the honest broker in some type of peace negotiations.  And I mean, if the Iranians and the Arabs in that region are so foolish as to think that Britain could ever be an honest broker in any kind of negotiation, well, more fool you, Islamic world.  But the world is waiting to hear what Mr.  Johnson has to say. ",
