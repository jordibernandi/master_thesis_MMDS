When it's translated into English, his name is translated to altogether lovely.  So I guess my question would be, why was it translated to altogether lovely?  And if Muhammad's name is in the Bible, why don't Christians recognize that and look towards the Quran for answers or to see if there is some truth in the Quran? ",

            "text": "Okay, well, Song of Solomon, as you know, was written at about 1000 BC.  Muhammad was born in 570 AD.  So there's a 1500 year gap there.  I don't know if it's a coincidence.  I don't know if it's the same person.  I don't know if it's translated right.  I'd have to look it up.  But to your second question with regard to the Quran, well, there's a lot of truth in the Quran, just like there's a lot of truth in many other religious writings.  But the main difference, well, there's several differences, as you know.  The main difference... Well, there's several differences, but let's just talk about Jesus for a second.  Jesus is said to have risen from the dead.  We've been through some of the evidence here.  The documents that say that were written in the first century by people who were there and other people who checked it out, like Luke.  The Quran comes along, as you know, written after Muhammad dies in 632 A.D I should go this way because that's forward for you.  632 A.D And in Surah 4, verse 157, it says that Jesus didn't even die, much less rose from the dead.  He was taken straight to heaven.  Maybe somebody like Judas was put in his place on the cross, okay?  Now, for Christians and for people that look at the evidence, my question would be, why would you take a document written over 600 years later to tell you what happened when you have documents that were written by the eyewitnesses who were there?  And also, these documents say that he rose from the dead.  And if he rose from the dead, that better explains the spread of the church out of Jerusalem at that time.  Why would you take a document written so much later?  The other problem, it seems to me, is that if you look at Surah 5, verse 68, I think it is, it says, O ye people of the book, ye have no ground to stand on unless you stand on the law and the gospel.  In other words, Allah is telling the believers of Judaism and Christianity to obey God.  The Old Testament and the New Testament, the Law and the Gospels.  Well, when that was written in the 600s  A.D.,  we already knew what the Law and the Gospels said.  We have entire Bibles from the 300s A.D Now, some Muslims will say, well, we can't trust the New Testament because it's been corrupted.  Well, if that's the case, why is the Quran telling us to trust the New Testament?  We know it hasn't been corrupted from Muhammad's time on.  So basically the problem here is the Quran tells us to obey the New Testament, but the New Testament leaves us no room for the Quran. ",
