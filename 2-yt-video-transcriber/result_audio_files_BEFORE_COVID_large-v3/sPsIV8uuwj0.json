Not only that, the roads are devoid of any traffic jams.  So for those of you who think Africa is all bushes, people don't wear clothes, it's not developed and all of that, we are traveling on an African road in Kigali.  Rwanda.  And in how many places do you travel that you have a view?  Left, right, center, everywhere.  I can say without a doubt that the road here in Kigali at least it's as good as anyone you can get in Europe.  It is impossible not to get emotional when visiting the Rwandan Genocide Museum.  Once inside, you are confronted with evidence of man inhumanity to man.  Thank you.  Everything is well documented and you wonder how human beings can commit these kind of atrocities against fellow human beings.  At the burial ground outside the building, there is an endless list of names of people who perished during the Rwandan genocide.  At the other side of town, there is also a monument to the Belgian soldiers who were killed during the genocide.  Thank you.  I'm sitting at a restaurant sometime somewhere in downtown in Kigali.  My taxi driver said this is the best place to eat.  So let's see what they're going to provide to us. ",

I couldn't finish it, but I think I've really tried.  Kigali is beautiful.  Kigali is nice.  Kigali is friendly.  The people are some of the most friendliest people you will ever encounter in Africa.  People are smiling.  People are chill.  People are willing to help you.  People are just generally nice.  So, we are going to buy this for 11,000.  You want that money?  So, let's see.  Thank you.  Kigali is a place I would recommend for anybody who wants to visit any city in Africa.  So unfortunately, that's the end of the most beautiful three days of traveling I've ever experienced.  I am going back now, flying Rwandan Air, going back to Nairobi.  It was my first time in Kigali, and it's certainly not gonna be the last time.  Kigali, I'm gonna miss you, but I'll be back. ",
