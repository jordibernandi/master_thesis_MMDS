            "text": "Welcome to Lenin in 5 minutes.  Today's topic, Lenin's theory of imperialism.  To understand Lenin's arguments about imperialism, we need to get a better grasp of one of the most central concepts in Lenin's geopolitics, finance capital.  Unfortunately, capital, in the Marxist terms, is a very frustrating concept to define.  Marx was not satisfied with defining capital simply as money, or money used in the production process.  For Marx, capital is a process that defines the social relations of production.  Capital is value in the process of self-valorization, and thus can manifest itself as money, but can equally manifest itself as the commodities or the means of production involved in the productive process.  finance capital is then capital that has accumulated beyond the production process and circulates within the banking and investment structures.  most importantly finance capital is in constant motion and cannot be by definition simply accumulated money infrastructure or other commodities.  Moreover, finance capital is an alliance between large firms and banking capital, dominating the economy of the state.  Lenin actually drew a lot of his ideas about finance capital from Rudolf Hilferding's Das Finanzkapital, though as we will see now, Lenin built extensively on the concept.  Lenin showed that concentration of capital led to a stage of capitalism known as monopoly capitalism.  In this stage, the export of goods is exceeded by the export of capital.  Instead of investing in the living standards of the working class at home, capital moves into foreign territories, where profits are usually high, for capital is scarce, The price of land is relatively low, wages are low, raw materials are cheap.  Capital has become overripe in the most developed capitalist countries, so it seeks new markets.  Lenin agreed that there might be periods of cooperation among the bourgeois camps in the international arena, but he points out that such cooperation is largely situational and temporary.  Especially in the context of the Second World War and the Cold War period afterwards, capital found it beneficial to cooperate in the face of a larger threat.  This peaceful time was also, in part, possible because American capital emerged from the war as the unequivocal, dominant economic force, particularly in comparison to the decimated productive capabilities of its European counterparts.  Lenin allowed for these periods of exceptional relations, but he stated that ultimately the nature of capitalism as a system of necessary competition mandates a return to the division of the world among various camps.  However, beyond the division of the world, Lenin emphasized the impetus to gain exclusive control of raw materials and tighter control of foreign markets that arose out of the globalizing conditions of the monopoly stage of capitalism.  Having reached a certain stage of development in which concentration and accumulation of capitalism results in the growing circulation of finance capital, overripe countries export their investments abroad.  As they do so, they find their finance capital to naturally clash in areas of targeted investments.  so begins a painful process of drawing and redrawing carving and recarving the boundaries between major empires.  as we witness china export its finance capital to underdeveloped parts of the world tensions rise between the young superpower and the old seat of power in the white house.  China and the US have already entered that stage of geopolitical restructuring, the inevitable outcome of which will be dangerous conflict.  In summary, Lenin's theory of international political economy fits perfectly in the mold of the last century.  After a violent struggle for new markets abroad, the major powers of the world collided in the form of two world wars that wreaked havoc on a global scale.  As American capital emerged dominant from the ashes of the world wars, it was able to unify the international capitalist class against the threat that far outweighed the dangers of infighting.  a growing socialist bloc.  The USSR, regardless of whether or not you think it was a truly socialist state, did not play by the rules of the global market.  On the contrary, it presented a model that was very dangerous to the entire capitalist mode of production.  As late as the 1970s, the USSR and its allies posed a threat that the coalition of capitalist countries took very seriously.  However, this temporary and uneasy alliance between major capitalist powers is gone.  Not only that, but the last half-century has given a number of countries enough time to reach that stage of capitalism Lenin wrote about.  We are now on the brink of a totally new international dynamic that is already demonstrating a tension we did not see during the fleeting Pax Americana.  As we return to a global arena defined by competition between major capitalist centers, Lenin's international political economy will become increasingly relevant.  That's it for today's video.  What are your thoughts on where we stand in global politics?  Do you think Lenin's hypotheses can still be applied?  And if so, what kind of future might we be headed for?  Thanks for watching, and until next time, remember, the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.  The point is to change it. ",
