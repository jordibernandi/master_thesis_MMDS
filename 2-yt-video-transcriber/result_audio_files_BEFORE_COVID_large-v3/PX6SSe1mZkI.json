            "text": "Democrats running for president say these weapons must be banned immediately.  And this time it won't simply just be a ban on the sale of them like we saw in 1994 under the Clinton administration.  Lawmakers now say they're going to seize these weapons from law abiding citizens, take them away by force.  Joe Biden is supposedly the moderate Democratic candidate in the race.  And he proposed that without apology last month.  Watch.  So to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they're gonna come for my guns.  Bingo, you're right if you have an assault weapon.  The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.  So what exactly does it mean, assault weapon?  Well, Democrats in the Congress think they've supplied an answer.  211 House Democrats, that's almost all of them, are backing a bill that they say would ban assault weapons in America.  The next time they hold complete power in Washington, and that could be soon, it will likely become law.  So what does the law do?  Well, its definition of an assault weapon is almost 1,700 words long.  We read it today.  It includes dozens of specifically named firearms, including the AR-15 rifle that millions of Americans own and some use for deer hunting.  Yes, it is used for hunting, Joe Biden.  You know nothing.  Like the original assault weapons ban from 1994, the new one includes definitions designed to ban minor features that make, in effect, a gun look scarier.  Any semi-automatic rifle, for example, regardless of how powerful it is, will be banned as long as it has a detachable magazine and one other feature that House Democrats appear to be frightened by.  Whether it's a forward grip or a barrel shroud or a threaded barrel for attaching a suppressor, none of those things make a gun more powerful or more deadly.  They're cosmetic features.  They don't make it more military style, but they do make them illegal under this proposed law.  Handguns under the bill are targeted the same way.  The bill would ban any semi-automatic handgun pistol that weighs more than 50 ounces.  The gun doesn't have to do anything else.  A pistol being heavier than Democrats think it should be makes it a military style assault weapon.  Are you catching on here?  This is all made up.  This is a gun bill written by people who know nothing about guns.  It's moronic.  The bill doesn't just target rifles or handguns, though.  Even shotguns are listed.  The bill would ban any semi-automatic shotgun with, quote, a revolving cylinder.  By the way, there aren't many shotguns with a revolving cylinder, but it would mean that the antique Colt 1855 shotgun is now banned because it's a military style assault weapon.  But the real villain for Democrats is in guns, despite all the rhetoric, is actually bullets.  Their bill will ban any American from protecting him or herself with a firearm that holds more than 10 rounds.  Wait, do we just say any American?  No, of course not.  It's not any American.  This law would only apply to you.  It would not apply to the people writing it.  Our exalted leaders in Washington will be as safe as they always have been.  I know some of the bodyguards living at your house, okay?  And they've got magazines that I can't protect my family with.  Does that bother you as a champion of the little guy?  Tucker, someone who serves in public service for a limited period of time and in the society we're living in, I hate to say it, but public servants are vulnerable to violence in a different way.  So the guy delivering baked goods to the bodega in East New York at 3 in the morning.  He doesn't get to protect himself because his job isn't important enough.  But Bill de Blasio, who works like eight hours a month, he needs bodyguards with guns that you're not allowed to have because his life and the lives of his family members are way more important than your life.  Oh, I get it.  So protection for me, but not for thee.  That really is our governing elites in a nutshell.  Bill de Blasio has endorsed forcible gun seizures.  So is Elizabeth Warren.  The idea that we don't have elimination of assault type weapons, magazines that can hold multiple bullets in them is absolutely mindless.  Yes, mindless.  That's the perfect word for what you just heard.  Joe Biden has said in the clip we just played that any magazine that holds more than a single round ought to be banned, and it's crazy not to. ",

They own firearms because they have a constitutional right to do so to protect themselves and their families.  And everything that NRA members represent, rural America, individualism, personal responsibility, is what the left hates.  It's not just about guns.
