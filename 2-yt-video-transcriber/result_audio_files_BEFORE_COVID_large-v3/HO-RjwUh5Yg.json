            "text": "Hey what's up everybody, my name is Adam and you're watching me on Transtastic.  I post bi-weekly so make sure to tune in.  Today I'm going to be talking about pros and cons on medical transition and mostly about my personal experience.  So let's get into it.  Mind you, I have not had any surgery yet so I only am on T. So, you know, medically transitioning and, like, having surgery would be fucking heaven.  Like, that is a pro, but I don't have that yet.  So everything I talk about is mainly, like, just T-related.  The biggest pro, I think, in medical transitioning is, to me, passing.  Because once I started to pass, I started having male privilege, and I started even being more comfortable with myself.  You know, that I don't always need to prove anything to anyone, and I'm just fucking, like, left alone to live my life.  And that was something that it may sound very easy, but I fought so hard to just be left alone.  I don't think I have much cons from medically transitioning.  Like it was mainly acne.  Freaking acne is pretty annoying, especially the first months of transition.  I still get acne at times, but when I first started hormones and like the first months overall, It was not cute and I really like had to get myself on a whole skincare system to get my skin together.  And it's partially worked, I guess.  So now like I kind of know how it works dealing with my skin.  One of the obvious pros, the voice change.  Okay, so I talked about how I finally feel comfortable, but it's one of them.  I feel like finally I can talk how much I want, as much as I want.  And I talk a lot, let me tell you.  Because before, I wasn't that comfortable with my voice so much that I let people talk over me all the damn time.  And I bet a lot of guys, like trans guys, relate to this.  Another con would be losing hair or receding hairline.  Now, I'm scared to lose my hair as hell.  That's why I'm like now just wildly experimenting with it overall.  And I'm not afraid to go short now.  Because before I only liked my hair medium length.  But now I'm like, I need to be mentally prepared to lose my hair.  Because it's kind of genetic.  There is 30% chance that I'm not gonna lose my hair.  Okay.  But regardless, my hairline did, you know, mature.  Like, did go back a little bit.  Freaks me out.  Hair loss is a thing that a lot of trans guys deal with.  But then again, it depends on your family.  So, you know, you don't have to, like, feel like shit or something.  Like, look at your dad.  Look at... other guys around you in the family and see how their hair is doing.  I would say that my experience transitioning is very positive you know in general.  yeah the only complaint I had was acne hair loss.  potentially that didn't happen yet.  otherwise I'm satisfied about everything T did to me.  I really Can't think of anything that I really hate about it.  I love everything.  I love the voice changes.  I wish it could change and get even lower.  You know, the facial hair.  I don't like, I'm not a fan of body hair in general, but now at least like I don't care.  Like I don't feel the pressure to like shave it or anything.  whatever.  but i bet not everyone's experience is like mine.  so i'd like to know about yours.  i could give you i mean like the pros and cons of tea but you could literally research that and it's everywhere.  uh otherwise i wanted to put up my own experience.  uh because that's something i'm familiar with.  i hope you guys like this video and i'll see you in another one bye.
