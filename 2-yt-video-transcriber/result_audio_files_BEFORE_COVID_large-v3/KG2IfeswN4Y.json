Well, I used to.  I don't really hang out with them anymore.  Because honestly, being around that type of environment and those types of people that cater to women and are very blue pill and don't understand the whole matrix of society and the hierarchies and hypergamy and all this shit.  It honestly just drives me insane watching them simp with their girlfriends.  I really can't stand to watch it and I can't stand to see a man spend his entire paycheck and most of his time and his resources and all his efforts and pouring that into this girl.  So my first example of a friend that I had, he over winter break, because I'm in college, in case any of you guys didn't know that, I'm in college right now.  And this guy, literally for Christmas, right?  Christmas, very expensive holiday.  So he decides that it's his grand idea, he works at Apple, making a little bit over minimum wage, okay?  He decides his grand idea is to get his girlfriend a Kate Spade purse, and a new iPhone, the newest iPhone.  I think it's iPhone 11 or iPhone 10. iPhone 11, I think now.  Yeah, the iPhone 11.  He decides to do that.  Mind you, as an employee, I think he gets a discount, but it's only like 35% off or maybe 25% off.  So he's still paying a lot of money out of pocket for this iPhone.  So this guy, this simp, my simp friend, decides to buy this girl that he just met, mind you.  And this girl already works... Oh yeah, this girl already fucking works at Apple, guys.  She already works at Apple, so she could easily just get this phone herself, alright?  And this guy, my friend, we're just going to call him Juan.  Juan meets this girl at his job and decides that I'm going to get this grand idea, buy her this Kate Spade purse on top of the iPhone.  Like the iPhone wasn't already enough, decides to spend extra money on the Kate Spade purse for her.  And those are very expensive purses, as many of you guys know.  There's always a long ass line outside of the mall for those purses.  It's completely ridiculous, completely overhyped.  That is like the Sim Central.  Like if you just look at Kate Spade, you will see men standing in that line of Kate Spade that is fucking like 15, 20 people deep.  And it's all men just carrying bags like this.  Just fucking, I'm so fucking tall, I can't even show you guys.  But they're just, they have this look on their face just like, no, like fucking kill me now.  That kind of look on their face, man.  And a lot of these guys, especially during Christmas, that's where they spend all their fucking money.  That's where all their resources and all their money, all their hard work, all their overtime that they work goes straight to the girl, straight to their girlfriend.  All right, guys?  So don't be a simp.  Don't be a mangina like this guy.  If you guys want to hear more stories, I have a ton of more stories, but I wanted to keep this video short and sweet just to get to the root of the whole issue with this that I have.  And guess what, guys?  Guess what she got?  Oh, yeah.  Guess what she decided to get this guy for Christmas after he went and got her a Kate Spade purse and an iPhone?  Guess.  Nothing.  She didn't get him anything.  Okay, well she got him a jacket.  She got him like a Nike jacket.  Guys, that's a $60 fucking jacket compared to like a $400, $500, $600 purse.  Sometimes even more than that.  There's a $1,000 purse in that store.  A $1,000 purse, $60 jacket, iPhone 11. iPhone 11, guys.  For nothing.  Literally, for nothing.  Anyways, drop a like if you enjoyed this video.  I just want to share my experience.  Let me know in the comments if you guys have had any similar experiences with blue pill friends in the past.  I had to cut that shit off.  You had to cut that shit off in 2020.  This shit has to stop, guys.  We can't keep catering to these women like that. ",
