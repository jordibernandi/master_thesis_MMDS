            "text": "No collusion, no collusion.  I have no idea when it's going to be released.  It's interesting that a man gets appointed by a deputy, he writes a report.  Never figured that one out.  The man gets appointed by a deputy.  He writes a report.  I had the greatest electoral victory, one of them the history of our country.  Tremendous success.  Tens of millions of voters.  And now somebody's going to write a report who never got a vote.  So we'll see what the report says.  Let's see if it's fair.  I have no idea when it's going to be released.  The Press Have you revert your policy in Syria?  No, no, we're in Syria.  We're leaving 200 people there and 200 people in another place in Syria closer to Israel for a period of time.  I brought this out for you because this is a map of everything in the red.  This was on election night in 2016.  Everything red is ISIS.  When I took it over, it was a mess.  Now, on the bottom, that's the exact same.  There is no red.  In fact, there's actually a tiny spot which will be gone by tonight.  So that's ISIS, red right there.  And the bottom one is how it is today.  This just came out 20 minutes ago.  So this is ISIS on election day, my election day, and this is ISIS now.  So that's the way it goes.  I don't mind.  I mean frankly I told the house if you want let him see it again.  I say a deputy because of the fact that the Attorney General didn't have the courage to do it himself.  a deputy that's appointed appoints another man to write a report.  I just won an election and with 63 million votes or so 63 million i had 206 to 223 in the electoral college 306 to 223. and i'm saying to myself wait a minute.  i just won one of the greatest elections of all time in the history of this country and even you will admit that.  and now i have somebody writing a report that never got a vote.  it's called the muller report.  So explain that, because my voters don't get it.  And I don't get it.  Now, at the same time, let it come out.  Let people see it.  That's up to the attorney general.  We have a very good attorney general.  He's a very highly respected man.  And we'll see what happens.  But it's sort of interesting that a man out of the blue just writes a report.  I got 306 electoral votes.  against 223.  That's a tremendous victory.  I got 63 million more.  I got 63 million votes.  And now somebody just writes a report.  I think it's ridiculous, but I want to see the report.  And you know who want to see it?  The tens of millions of people that love the fact that we have the greatest economy we've ever had.  I'm going to Ohio right now.  They were going to close the plant.  It's where they make the tanks.  It was going to be closed, and I stopped them from closing it.  And now it's thriving and doing great.  And the people of Ohio, they like Trump because I've done a great job in Ohio.  And I've done a great job all over the country.  That's what the people want to hear.  What do you want to hear?  I know nothing about it.  I know that he's conflicted.  And I know that his best friend is Comey, who's a bad cop.  And I know that there are other things, obviously.  You know, I had a business transaction with him that I've reported many times that you people don't talk about.  But I had a nasty business transaction with him and other things.  I know that he put 13 highly conflicted and, you know, very angry.  I call them angry Democrats in.  So, you know, so what it is.  Now, let's see whether or not it's legit.  You know better than anybody.  There's no collusion.  There was no collusion.  There was no obstruction.  There was no nothing.  But it's sort of an amazing thing that when you have a great victory, somebody comes in, does a report out of nowhere.  Tell me how that makes sense.  Who never got a vote, who?  the day before he was retained to become special counsel, I told him he wouldn't be working at the FBI.  And then the following day, they get him for this?  I don't think so.  I don't think people get it.  With all of that being said, I look forward to seeing the report. ",
