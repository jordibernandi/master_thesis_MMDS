            "text": "Hey there, folks.  So today we're going to be taking a bit of a departure from the politics that's normally hosted on this channel, and we're going to be discussing some drama that has erupted over the past week or so.  There have been a great many people who have encouraged me to make a video on this, and at first I resisted, in large part because the behavior of my detractors, the people who have been making evident their displeasure of my behavior.  their behavior led me to believe that any statement i made no matter how passive how conciliatory how genuine it would only worsen the drama that people would only think less of me.  I still don't know whether or not that's the case, but I do like to err towards honesty and transparency.  So, here I am with the video.  Now, I hear you asking, what drama?  Not all of you are aware of it, of course.  Many of you are, though, I assume.  To those of you who are not aware of it, I'm going to do my best to summarize it in language which is as neutral as possible.  Obviously, it's impossible for me to genuinely explain anything in neutral language.  We're all subject to our own biases, but nonetheless, I will try my best.  So, In late 2017, I was a member of a Discord channel which belonged to Destiny, a streamer on Twitch.  And in that Discord channel, I became friends with somebody named Poppy.  Poppy was known for her hot takes.  I had some hot takes on my own.  I thought we could form a friendship.  And so we did.  We talked for a period of several months, and over the course of that prolonged conversation, we discussed a great many things, often mutually.  We discussed, of course, politics, our personal lives, our respective mental illnesses, sexuality, flirting, dating, all that stuff.  And I thought at the time that these were perfectly normal, healthy conversations.  that We had a falling out around, I think, late 2017 or early 2018.  I don't quite remember.  It was some dumb argument about feminism or our opinions on problematic... I don't remember exactly, but it's unrelated to the drama.  But after we had that falling out, Poppy started accusing me quite publicly in that Discord channel of having sexually harassed her over the course of our friendship, over the course of the few months.  This was a shock to me at the time, to say the least, because I didn't feel I had engaged in any sexual harassment.  But things got quite heated quite quickly.  Many of the people on the Discord took sides, myself or her.  We said a great many nasty things back and forth at one another.  But ultimately, nothing really came of it.  um and after a short while things returned more or less to normal in fact.  uh a little while after that poppy and i were able to talk with one another without any shit throwing on either side but we never quite overcame that mutual antagonism which arose from her accusations.  um So that's that.  A few months ago, I was a member of a Discord channel, or server, which was called Polychads.  Now that's P-O-L-I, Polychads, as in politics, not P-O-L-Y, as in polyamorous.  I've seen people making that mistake.  And there was a person on there named Pastel.  There was a debate between myself and Pastel, which is one of the earliest videos on this channel.  Not that the channel's super old or anything, but still, but still.  Anyway... Pastel and I were talking to one another.  We ended up debating.  That's recorded.  That's there for posterity.  And it became evident to me a short time after I began speaking with them in the server that they were interested in me sexually.  This can be corroborated by the testimony of anyone who was there at the time.  They were clearly interested in me.  And I'm a horny bastard.  So, you know, I reciprocated interest.  Because, yeah, why the hell not?  So I engaged with them in flirtation, both publicly and privately, for a period of one or two weeks.  It really wasn't that long of a time.  Until it became clear to me, through the testimony of others, and through their own behavior, that Pastel was... not emotionally or mentally capable of healthily engaging in any kind of e-flirtation with me.  um based on what I had seen from my interactions with them.  So I decided to cut contact with them.  Not full out, full stop, block them and everything, but to distance myself from them to prevent harm from occurring, which I thought was the responsible decision to make at the time.  Shortly thereafter, Poppy appeared on the server.  Actually, I think they'd been a mod prior.  I just hadn't seen her in the server prior.  And what happened from that point forward, I can only interpret.  I don't know.  I can't read other people's DMs.  But it seemed to me like Poppy and Pastel spoke with one another, and this encouraged Pastel to reframe the way in which they looked in our conversation and begin... publicly accusing me of having engaged in misbehavior, of being sexually harassing towards Poppy.  So the drama sort of came up again.  I later had a conversation with Pastel over voice, and from the conversation I had, it seemed to me as though Pastel did not believe that I had engaged in impropriety with them.  But it still stood to show that the drama had been engaged in once more.  I was banned from the Polychad server following that outburst of drama.  a few days ago.  Some screenshots of the DMs that I had had with Poppy, so these are about year and a half old screenshots, were collected and brought to the attention of the aforementioned streamer, Destiny.  And this then became a very, very public spectacle.  Destiny showed those screenshots on stream, and... I had an opportunity, very briefly, to go on there and defend myself.  I felt as though the screenshots did not fully contextualize the conversation that I had had with Poppy, which is why down in the comments I am linking the full, unedited, except for Doc's being removed.  I mean, you don't want my address, right?  That's why I am posting the full unedited logs down below for scrutiny and I invite your gaze.  But nonetheless, I was brought on to Destiny's stream to explain myself.  And I did a, to put not too fine a point on it, very bad job explaining myself.  I was nervous.  So, I would like to take a second shot at explaining myself here.  Here's what I won't be addressing.  I'm not going to be addressing some of the more outlandish extrapolations people have made about my behavior based on the logs.  There are some people who are saying shit like me.  getting into leftism six or seven years ago.  has all been part of a long-standing ploy to get left-leaning people to lower their guard around me so that I could one day message them and work my way into their news.  Obviously, that's ridiculous.  I got into leftism to smash chuds.  So, that's what I won't be addressing.  What I will be addressing is the conversation that I had with Poppy a year and a half ago.  It had been a while since I had looked over those logs.  I mean, I don't regularly go over old conversations that I had with people who are no longer my friends.  And the last memory that I had had of those logs was the one which I had had when Poppy had first accused me of sexually harassing her.  That is to say, one of indignation and rebuke.  But since then I have had more time to look at those logs.  I have grown somewhat as a person over the past year and a half, and I feel differently about those logs now and about my behavior.  When I was on Destiny's Dream, I said that I had behaved cringely.  I believe that I said, again, imperfect memory, that I had been at times a little creepy, that I had pushed boundaries, that I had been overly facilitated towards sexual conversation.  And people called me a harasser, a sexual harasser.  And I thought, no, I'm not a sexual harasser.  I just did those things I just described.  I just pushed boundaries.  I just talked about sex maybe too much.  I just was perhaps not as cognizant of the conversational partner's discomfort as I could have been.  Do those things make me a sexual harasser?  And I've thought about it over the past few days.  The question seems a little leading.  You can probably tell where I got.  And the answer is that it doesn't really matter what I think.  The logs are public.  They're out there.  People can see them.  People have read them.  And then they have accused me of engaging in sexual harassment.  And far be it from me, somebody who smashes linguistic prescriptivists, to say that I've engaged in those behaviors, but not sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment is what we define it to be, and the definition seems to have been laid out.  So, I'm not happy with my behavior.  I said that while I was on stream.  I said that in regards to this conversation, I had used that as a template to learn how to better recognize discomfort in others, how to more responsibly speak to other people without making them uncomfortable, without being one note on the conversation.  That is something that I've tried to work on over the past year and a half.  And again, I have.  That's one of the reasons why I made the decision to distance myself from Pastel a year and a half later.  When I recognized they were not, at least in my perspective, capable of engaging healthily in flirtation, I backed off.  Because I think I've grown as a person since then.  But that's not to say that I'm done growing as a person.  So I'm going to say this.  The logs of me speaking with Poppy are reflective of poor behavior on my part.  sexual harassment being a broader term, more specifically, an unwillingness to back off certain topics, a callousness in regards to the discomfort of the person with whom I was speaking, and a general fastidiousness when it came to topics of a sexual matter.  I've worked to change my behavior since then, and I'm going to continue to work to change my behavior in the future.  We're all works in progress.  We are.  And it's important to me that I say all of this, not just for my sake or to clear people's perspectives of me or to add any finality to this issue, but moreover because I do care about these sort of broader social implications which are made evident here.  tendencies that I demonstrated towards callousness and fastidiousness and ignorance and well harassment.  these are not mere symptoms of my poor behavior.  They're also a product of broader social problems, which we which we know.  I mean, if you're watching this video, you're probably lefty.  You know, you're probably with me on that.  We know that male entitlement towards sexuality is a thing.  And we know if you've watched my videos, you know that I'm not rid of male entitlement conceptually.  And if I am to continue attempting to be any kind of left-leaning public figure, it is essential not only that I attempt to improve myself, but also that I be able to draw my personal failings to a broader social system from which they originated.  And I'm interested in that social system.  And I'm interested in helping young men, or young people of any gender, really, but broadly young men, get better at recognizing poor behavior in themselves and learning what they can do to improve upon it in the future.  And that does, at least in this instance, start with me.  So, there have been people who have suggested that I take a break from the internet, that I get off YouTube and Twitch for a few months.  I will not be doing that.  For two reasons.  For one, I need this to live.  This here is the only reason I could afford groceries this week.  And it's nice to be able to eat, I have to say.  But two, no.  Culture war is ongoing, my friend.  I'm going to keep arguing with chuds.  I'm going to keep dismantling reactionary rhetoric.  I'm going to keep trying to make the world a better place.  I'm not stopping in that regard.  So, to those of you who are unfamiliar with this drama prior to listening about it in this video, I'm sorry for clogging up your feed.  I don't want you to base your appreciation of this channel and its content off of misinformation or a lack of information.  So, here, I lay this all out before you.  To those of you who are aware of the drama and were waiting for me to give a response or a clarification, hello.  This is not a matter of satisfying you.  This is a matter of me being honest about my feelings.  I hope that the feelings that I have had are ones which you find agreeable.  And if not, I hope that in spite of my impropriety, you can continue to enjoy my content.  Because I think, you know, I think I say some cool stuff here on stream and here on YouTube.  And if you're one of the people who didn't really care for me beforehand and has been using all of this drama as an excuse to harass me or harass my Discord or harass the people who have not yet decided to harass me, I have to say I don't think very well of you.  But I do sincerely hope that this quells your rage.  Thank you for listening.  I love you all very much.  And Have a wonderful evening or afternoon or morning or day or whatever time zone you're in.  Bye. ",
