            "text": "Hey, what's up, guys?  Ronan Mann here at the gym, powering out the weights, my once-a-week workout, feeling great.  And I just had this realization.  I'm listening to this audiobook, and it's one of the exercises.  It says that you should think of the one person in your life who was the most, like basically the kindest person with the purest motives.  So somebody who, you know, really was just good all the way through to you.  And they made you feel good.  You know, just thinking of them makes you feel warm and good.  And I started to think back in my life of who was the person in my life that I could use as an example in my head for this exercise.  And immediately I thought of Mr.  Moulton and this guy who was my neighbor when I was a kid.  And as, you know, our house was very chaotic, a lot of violence, dad getting arrested, things like that.  So I would... be very scared as a little kid, wondering what was gonna happen.  I was very insecure.  I didn't know what was going on, but Mr.  Moulton was next door.  And Mr.  Moulton was just, I don't know how much he knew, because we were in these cheap apartments and you could hear everything.  I guess that he probably knew a lot more than I thought he knew.  As a little kid, I thought that no one else knew what I felt.  I thought it was only inside my house, inside my mind.  I didn't realize that other people could see things and could... empathize from the outside.  I just never assumed that.  But Mr.  Moulton was always there.  And I remember we would go to his house whenever there was a problem at our house.  And also, Mr.  Moulton... I knew him quite well because they lived there for a long, long time.  He did a lot of nice things for me.  One of them he taught me... I mentioned in another episode that he taught me how to wash cars and how to make money.  He was the very first guy.  He said... I was energetic, running around, and he said... He said, you know, do you want to make some money?  And I had been actually, you know, that's not true.  I had been cutting lawns for money, but there wasn't many lawns in California because the land is expensive.  And so there wasn't a lot of lawns where we were.  In fact, there was no lawns.  So it was like that job was not too profitable for me.  So he said, you know, and then he showed me how to wash his car and he paid me $5, which was huge money back then.  And I was like, oh my gosh.  But the thing is, I knew that he loved me.  He was showing me kindness.  He was showing me love.  No other reason, right?  He didn't want his car washed.  He could care less.  He's cheaper to go to get a car wash.  Back then, you could get your car washed for like 75 cents, you know.  You go to the car wash, automatic, it was super cheap.  We're talking back in the 70s, mid, early 70s, right?  So, but he did it out of caring for me.  And I sensed that.  Even at that age, I was like... I was like, wow, this is a very manly, kind, mentoring kind of thing he's doing for me.  I thought, wow, that's pretty cool.  So I did my best.  I always did my best with his car.  And I was very proud of this.  I had this new tool in my toolbox.  Either way, he did that.  And he was there whenever there was an issue in my family or whatever.  But I think most importantly... Most importantly for me, like why he was so important, is just his presence.  You know what I'm saying?  Like some men, you just know they're alive and you feel better.  Like you just feel this rock.  Like things are going to be okay somehow, no matter what happens.  And that was the feeling he always gave me.  Mr.  Moulton always gave me that feeling.  And I know that my mother... had met him just before he passed away.  his wife was very very sweet too Mrs.  Moulton like the two of these people like together they were just like a duo man.  they were a team both very very loving and my mom had met him.  she told me last time i saw her that just before he died he had met her and he was exactly the same as he was back in the 70s.  you know just the same Mr.  Moulton.  you know he was just a kind soul and in a loving soul.  but also i think there was a wisdom he had a wisdom to and he had a desire to pass on and to teach.  you know it was and to guide and that was a very.  that was also a very important part of him because he took it upon himself to kind of help things, fix things, teach things in the neighborhood.  And at the time, I couldn't really appreciate it, you know, like what he was doing for me in my life.  But as I think back to this exercise, I think, wow, Mr.  Bolton is the kindest person I've ever known.  Like, if I had to put, like, you know, in a box, I'd say, okay, you know, you've got to put a label, right?  I'm looking for somebody who's the best for this example, for this book.  I'm like, Mr.  Moulton, hands down.  Mrs.  Moulton came up in my mind, too, because she also was very kind.  But Mr.  Moulton was the one, actually.  It was close, though.  They were both, like I say, very nice.  But the thing is, the reason why I'm telling you this story, the reason why I hope it's inspirational is because he in okay him and mrs moulton did not have children and so they they could not have children and so they adopted this boy and and he lived next door to me.  he was a little bit older than me but i knew the whole story because you know i knew them before he came around and then after.  so They had gone out of their way to adopt this boy.  that was very troubled.  They wanted to adopt like a very broken home.  They wanted to really help somebody.  That was what they wanted to do.  And so they adopted this boy who was like, I don't know his whole background, but it was like horrific, right?  So I can't remember his name.  But either way, this story really ends powerful.  So he had this boy, and the boy was just a rebel.  He never, he never, you know, he never, like, I remember, like, listening to Cheech and Chong records in his room.  He just was just broken.  This guy was, man, he was not... Like, you know, talk about broken home.  Like, this kid, he was messed up.  He was seriously messed up.  And it wasn't something that Mr.  Moulton didn't really appreciate, that some people are broken beyond measure, you know.  And that was the one thing.  He overestimated he could help anybody.  By taking this particular kid in.  That's my opinion.  And the guy came around.  He was just trouble.  I remember he was like he was a 70s.  He had this like muscle car.  He was always like doing burnouts.  He didn't listen.  He's always screaming.  He was doing he's smoking weed, you know, back then smoking weed, you know, like causing trouble and everything.  He was just no respect for authority at all.  And to me, it was amazing because Mr.  Moulton was so nice.  So it was like this real contrast.  Well, then eventually I heard that his son that he adopted got married and had three children.  And I was like, wow, that's amazing.  I thought Mr.  Moulton changed that guy.  And then I heard that his son committed suicide.  And he had three children, three young children.  and his son committed suicide and left them without a father, without income.  So basically everything that Mr.  Moulton did for, and Mrs.  Moulton did for him, It came to naught.  And then Mr.  Moulton died after that.  Both Mrs.  and Mr.  Moulton died after that.  And I'm sure that in their minds, they considered, I'm guessing, because we're all human, right?  We are all human.  And I'm guessing that they really considered the whole thing a failure.  Like it was like, not just a failure, but like a tragic, tragic thing.  Tragic failure that maybe they were even in their minds, like maybe even partly a cause of, you know, it's like it's amazing how self-hating and how we can beat ourselves down.  But when I realized this morning, I've always felt that that was a big lesson for me in many ways.  Mr.  Moulton taught me so many lessons.  But the one, and I thought the final lesson he taught me until this morning was that some people can't be helped.  You know, there's no hope for some people.  But I realized when I was doing this exercise, I realized he taught me another lesson.  And it's a very valuable lesson I wanted to pass on.  Here it is.  Is a man can do, a man who does good in this world can die and think he had no effect on anybody.  He can think that it was all for naught.  It was all useless.  And he could sit on his deathbed And be sure and have proof.  I mean, Mr.  Moulton, this was pretty good proof, right?  Because if he wouldn't have helped this guy, he probably wouldn't have gotten married.  He would have been so screwed up.  And he wouldn't have left the three kids, right?  Now, we don't know how those kids turn out.  I personally would rather always be born than not be born.  So personally, I think... giving a child the chance to live is better than not.  I would always choose, if you ask me, you know, Ronan, would you choose to be aborted because of all the difficult things you went through in your life?  Or would you choose to live?  I mean, it's not even a question in my mind.  There's no doubt, no matter how hard life is, and no matter how short life is, I would always choose to be alive.  Always, man, always.  Because life is awesome.  it's not perfect it's difficult but it's fucking awesome.  it is like a rose it is like a miracle in this universe and there ain't many miracles.  you look out there it's like cold and dark and freezing.  you know freezing minus a zillion degrees out there in space and then we have life on earth.  so i always am going to choose the intelligence the the um just the sheer breathtaking opportunity we have to be alive in this world.  So I personally, you know, I think that his son did give birth, did give life to three children.  And that's a beautiful thing.  Even though, obviously, it was a tragedy also, a terrible tragedy.  And I don't know if it could have been prevented or not.  But what I realized is that Mr.  Moulton had no idea because I was not self-aware enough to tell him yet.  I didn't realize what he did for me.  I think that the love and the kindness and the generosity and the guidance and the wisdom and the security and the love that he was trying to give to his son, that he felt, I'm sure, was a failure.  He gave to me.  He passed it to me.  But it was like it was overflowing out of his life.  And I'm sure he had no idea.  He had no idea.  He had no idea that the kid who was next door, through the walls, his love reached over to me and changed my life.  And I believe that these are the type of things, you know, if I'm sitting here doing a book, I just think about it realistically, guys.  It's 2019.  I'm 54 years old.  I'm sitting here listening to a book about self-help.  And it's telling me to find the most loving person I've ever known so that I can have that as my, like a secure rock in my mind that whenever I go back and do this exercise that they recommend.  Whenever I do that, I can think of this person because it personifies that type of love, right?  And like, if this is the guy that comes up in my mind, you know, as that person in all of the people I've met, because I have a lot of friends, I know a lot of people.  So he gave an incredible gift to me.  He passed on.  And it was despite the fact that he didn't even know.  He didn't know.  How would you know?  Like, I don't even know.  Maybe he did it to my brother, too.  Maybe he helped my brother, too.  Maybe he helped my sister.  Maybe there was other kids, you know?  Like, he was trying to help this one kid, and he's like Santa Claus, like helping all the kids, right?  So I want to say to you guys is you might think, certain things about your life as you go, right?  It's a failure.  This didn't work out.  That didn't work out.  It's like that old Chinese saying, right?  You know, with the horse, right?  Give it time.  Like, I don't know.  I'm not sure yet, right?  Is it, you know, they'll say... In Chinese history, they'll say, you know, was the invasion of XYZ country a success?  And they'll say, well, we don't know yet.  Not enough time.  And they'll say, well, it's like 400 years ago.  They're like, yeah, we don't know yet.  Because it could change over time, right?  You know, so I... the other story about the horse right and the and the farmer's son.  you know i don't remember the whole story but basically the farmer's son uh you know the the father gets a horse and then he's riding and trying to teach it to to ride trying to break the horse and then his son uh you know gets kicked and gets his leg broken.  and then uh somebody asked the father this the the farmer you know uh You know, are you?  That's such a tragedy.  You got that horse and, you know, oh, yeah, first you got the horse.  And they said, you're so lucky you found this wild horse.  It's awesome.  He said, well, let's see, you know, and then the horse broke his leg.  And then they said, you're so unlucky.  Look, the horse that you brought home broke your son's leg.  And he's like, well, not sure yet.  Let's see.  And then, like later on, there was a war in the area, and the soldiers came by to get his son, but they couldn't take him because his leg was broken, and he couldn't fight.  And so, you know, it was a disaster.  The war was a disaster, and the son lived.  And they said, you know, your son lived, and you're so lucky.  He says, well, let's see.  Because there's so many things like that in life.  So don't... As you go on your journey, I would really warn you not to take on a very negative perspective on things.  And simply because you don't know yet.  You don't know the final result of your life.  And Mr.  Bolton died many years ago.  And I just had this realization today.  I just had a realization that all his love, all his work, all his giving was a huge success for me.  And if he knew this, he would be, you know, I hope he knows this now.  He's smiling.  so give learn grow love and do not.  i mean you can't like the farmer.  you don't know what is going to be good in what is going to be bad.  you just do the best you can and you know.  it's funny how life is right.  it is very very funny how perspectives change.  so hang in there guys.  i hope that uh That story is just blowing my mind right now because that is absolutely a realization I just had.  So I wanted to share it with you guys.  So I hope you guys have a good day.  And I'm back on the weights.  All right.  See you. ",
