He was the first to put together the whole terrorism structure, you know, not only there, of course, in Syria and Iraq, but literally around the world.

He certainly isn't now, didn't he?  But... But he was much more of a significant figure than Osama bin Laden and also Abu Bakr Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS that Trump also took out.

None of them are going to try to replace him, but he's literally irreplaceable.  And like you said, he's killed many Iranians, many Americans.

OK, it's the country along with Russia and Turkey who are going to be the three main people who people groups are going to invade Israel in the last days.  Russia is called Rosh.  The leader Gog is the title.  He's the prince of Rosh.  Now, it's not because it sounds like Russia why it's Rosh.  There's many reasons why we believe that.  The country the furthest north of Israel and Babylon where Ezekiel was.  So you've got Turkey, which is called in Ezekiel, this is the territory there, Beth Togarmah and Gomer.  That's kind of the area where almost the three countries meet, Armenia, where you've got Russia, Turkey, and Iran.  they meet.  So Turkey, Iran, and, of course, Russia are going to be part of this last days coalition.  And, Greg, what's amazing about this, if we would be, in fact, we talked about it in 1970, if we said these countries would unite against Israel but Egypt would be out of it, people would think we were crazy because Egypt has fought every war against Israel, you know, 48, 67, 73, and yet now they're unfriendly with Israel.  The best friend of Israel in 1973 in the Middle East was the country of Iran, the Shah of Iran.  And it was only until 79 when Khomeini took over that it turned to the Islamic Republic of Iran, the greatest state sponsor of terrorism in the world right now.  So they have turned.  Turkey, a member of NATO, where Israelis took their vacations just a few years ago.  Wow.  has also turned.  And so you've got this coalition there, but particularly Iran, because they are, again, they're the one that's front and center with particularly what's going on now in the Middle East with these missiles they sent over recently to Iraq and the two bases there.  So we're to keep our eyes on them.  But one thing I need to mention, I always have to mention, what is going on there?  now?  If a regional war breaks out, it is not Ezekiel 38, 39.  There's four reasons why it's not.  It is not, okay?  Ezekiel 38, 39 is going to be Russia, a leader of Russia leading the invasion, the Prince of Rosh, number one.  Number two, the United States is not a player to Ezekiel 38, 39 war.  We're nowhere to be seen.  We can fill in the blank.  why, we don't know.  Today, we've got a battleship outside of the waters of Bahrain and the Persian Gulf looking right the crosshairs with Iran.  We are ready to blow the country to smithereens if we would have to.  We won't, fortunately, do that.  Number two.  Number three, Israel.  Israel is caught unaware in the Ezekiel 38-39 battle.  They're at the highest military alert right now.  And there's one country that isn't quite ready to join the coalition yet because the country's their name, and that's Libya.  But interestingly enough, right now, who is trying to make a peace treaty in Libya?  Turkey and Russia to put the country together.  I mean, you can't make this stuff up. ",

But I think the view with the less problems is the rapture of the church happens pretty much right before this Ezekiel 38, 39 invasion.  And here's the reason I say that.  In Ezekiel 39, it says at that time the people will realize that God is working on the side of Israel.  Yeah.  All right.  So he's got that unique relationship with Israel.  Greg will be back into play right now.  It's the church, of course, Jews and Gentiles, both.  There's going to come a time Israel's been set aside where he's going to work with them again.  And the fact that he, you know, basically with the invasion, he works on the side of Israel, intervenes, tells us he's starting to work with them.  So that seems to be at this last seven year period.  And so I think we're out of here when that happens. ",

We're all running towards a banner called eternity.  I like to put it that way, like running a race and eternity may be way out there in the distance or maybe right in front of our eyes.  We don't know.  So the key is to be ready to be watchful.  And that's where Jesus talked about Greg and Matthew 24, 25, when he was talking about the signs of the end, be ready, be watchful.  So we need to get our life together.  We need to, you know, be a salt and light to the world.  So as a Bible believing Christian, We also need to do this.  We need to understand the times.  Daniel 12.10 says at the time of the end, the wise will understand.  They know what's going on.  The wicked will never understand.  We can understand this, Greg.  We can understand the scenario because God's laid it all out.  But the wicked will never get it.  So Christians, you know, understand the times and live accordingly. ",

What's interesting about it, until very recently in our history, Greg, only two of the 25 signs where the world could see, Bible-believing Christians had to take like 23 of them on faith.  And they took them on faith.  One of the things I do, I look at writers that live anywhere from 100 to 400 years ago, Bible-believing Christians, and they believed all these events that we're seeing now would take place.  They saw it by faith.  We just open our eyes.  So this basically is what it's about. ",
