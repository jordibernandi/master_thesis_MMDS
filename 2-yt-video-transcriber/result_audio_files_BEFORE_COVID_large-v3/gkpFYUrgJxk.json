            "text": "Hey guys, Alex aka Miggy here and for those who don't know, there's a massive third wave purge happening across YouTube.  A lot of your favorite channels are at risk of being terminated, taken down, deleted forever.  It's fair enough to say that a lot of you guys and a lot of the content creators out there are migrating to BitChute.  Apparently, because Beatshoot actually offers Censorship 3 zones, so if you want to talk about anything you like, you can pretty much upload it there, and it's safe to say that it's going to stay up there on Beatshoot.  And I can certainly confirm that, because a lot of my more edgier content from the Men101 channel has been taken down on YouTube, but so far, it actually stayed on Beatshoot.  Now, the problem is, Australia, and I'm pretty sure New Zealand, have banned bitshoot.com.  So, unless you have a VPN account, you won't be able to access bitshoot.com.  And there is a way around it, but it all comes down to having a reliable VPN.  So, check this out.  I'm from Australia.  I'm going to enter bitshoot URL.  Let's see what happens.  Hmm... Safe to say, it's not loading.  We can also go to Google.  Yep, there you go.  This site can't be reached.  Sucks, huh?  Now, let's do the following.  Let's grab our trusty, reliable NordVPN and say, choose Taiwan as our location.  see what happens.  the key is to find a very fast server based in different countries.  so alright we're connected to Taiwan.  so now the internet thinks we are located in Taiwan when in fact we're located in this part of Australia Queensland.  so let's try BitChute again.  hey look what's going on.  BitChute is loading and here we are.  So if you guys want to get access to BitChute even though you're located in Australia and New Zealand, get yourself a reliable VPN service.  And the one that I can vouch for and recommend is NordVPN.  I will leave the link in the video description.  make sure you check it out.  it's really really cheap.  you sign up for 2.99 a month.  you just got to grab the two-year deal.  that's literally 2.99 a month guys.  that's cheaper than a cup of coffee every month.  that's nothing.  And yeah, you can sign up and access whatever you want.  You can use it for Netflix.  You can buy cheaper airline tickets.  You can access BitChute because, mark my words, a lot of the content creators are going to be migrating to BitChute.  in the near and distant future just because it's so hard to upload anything onto YouTube these days.  If you think your channel is safe, think again.  A lot of the MGTOW content creators such as Hammerhand are already Pretty much uploading only to BitChute and I'm pretty sure the rest of the guys will follow as well.  Just because it's gotten so pointless just to upload something and have it either age restricted or be giving a community guideline strike or have your channel completely taken out without any community guideline strikes at all.  So guys, sign up for NordVPN, check the video description as well as the pinned comment.  Let's make BitChute great again and send a message to platforms like YouTube that, hey, give us free speech or is going to be a massive shift in people where they actually get their information from.
