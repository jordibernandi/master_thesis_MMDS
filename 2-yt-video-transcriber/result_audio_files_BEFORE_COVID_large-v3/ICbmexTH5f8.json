I'll explain in further details as to why after this brief intro.  Both gold and silver prices had solid showings this week.  The gold spot price climbed over $40 an ounce.  And the gold spot price is closing around 1,340 fiat US dollars per troy ounce.  The silver spot price has finished the week just over the psychologically important 15 fiat Federal Reserve notes mark per troy ounce.  The gold-silver ratio is still threatening 90, closing this week at 89.  In a few short moments, we'll be back with this week's guest, Mr.  Dave Kranzler from Investment Research Dynamics.  But first, a quick word from our show's sponsor. ",

And to be frank, it's a lot harder, expensive, and more complicated than Puff expat plant multiple flag newsletters might have you believe.  The moment I arrived to my new homestead this morning... I called this week's guest, Mr.  Dave Kranzler from Investment Research Dynamics, asking him to briefly give not only you an update on his latest thoughts, but also update myself as I was busy moving everything this week and unable to stay on top of financial market news and ongoings.  I did see that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was in Financial News earlier on this past week talking about how the Fed may soon begin cutting interest rates again.  And that is where we will pick up on this casual discussion of financial markets ongoing with our returning guest, Mr.  Dave Kranzler.  Dave, what is going on in the stock market? ",
