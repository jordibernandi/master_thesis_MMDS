He raps so fast, it's almost hard to keep up with what he's saying and understand what he's saying.  Where there's this sign language interpreter named Amber Calloway.  She was doing sign language for one of his concerts.  And she keeps up with everything he's saying and she doesn't miss a beat.  I saw this on social media.  I was like, whoa, how can she keep up with everything that Twista is saying?  Check out this video, leave a comment, rate and subscribe.  Oh What's up? ",
