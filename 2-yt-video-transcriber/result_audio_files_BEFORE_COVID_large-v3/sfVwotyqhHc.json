            "text": "He's Donald Trump's worst nightmare, Michael Avenatti.  Joining us once again is Michael Avenatti.  Let's bring in Michael Avenatti.  Michael Avenatti.  Michael Avenatti.  Michael Avenatti, thank you very much.  He's out there saving the country.  Don Meacham says he may be the savior of the republic.  You are something of a folk hero now.  I owe Michael Avenatti an apology.  I've been saying enough already, Michael.  I've seen you everywhere.  What do you have left to say?  I was wrong, brother.  You have a lot to say.  I am just dying to hear what you think.  These people all like you.  I'm the only person right here.  Donald Trump fears more than Robert Miller.  We think you guys are the tip of the spear that's going to take down Donald Trump.  Michael Avenatti's a beast.  Okay, that's true.  He's a beast.  He's a beast.  I hand it to her, and I hand it to Michael Avenatti.  He has a bigger calling here, that being a lawyer is minimal compared to what he's doing.  No one has talked tougher directly to Donald Trump on TV than Michael Avenatti, and Donald Trump is afraid to mention his name.  That's fascinating.  Donald Trump is terrified of Michael Avenatti.  He gives Trump a run for his money more than anybody else, Michael Avenatti.  Existential threat to the Trump presidency.  The Democrats could learn something for you.  You are messing with Trump a lot more than they are.  He has no doubt created sheer panic in Donald Trump's very fragile mind.  Michael Avenatti is laying down the law as guest co-host.  And is he really thinking about running for president?  One reason why I'm taking you seriously as a contender is because of your presence on cable news.  You look at the field of Democrats right now, and Avenatti's the one who stands out.  If they decide they value a fighter most, people would be foolish to underestimate Michael Avenatti.  I have always said that they need a fighter.  Look, I mean, we're going to continue to use the media.  I think we've used it with great success.  All of my sexual fantasies involve handcuffs.  Aww.  Aww. ",
