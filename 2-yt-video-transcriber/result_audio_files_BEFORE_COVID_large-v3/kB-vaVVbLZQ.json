Australia, you're going to have to check against, you know, other time zones to find out when it's when it is in your area.  There is a guy that wants to come on and said that.  incels are doing something wrong.  i think i didn't get.  i didn't get quite a firm grasp on um where he was coming from but it was kind of from the uh behavioral determinism kind of mindset that your behavior is probably what's um affecting your looks or at least you need to be more aware of your behavior.  or i think i think that's where he's coming from.  so um i i would like him to look at the evidence i present to him and see what kind of deluded coping blue-pilled red-pilled um Response he has.  so that should be coming up at 9 p.m.. Uk time.  He's in Australia, so he's gonna have to get up at I think 6.  I'm not sure Australia has like what three different time zones, so I think where he is in particular It's gonna be about 6 a.m.. For him.  I'm not sure about the other time zones So hopefully he doesn't.  hopefully he wakes up in time and we can have a show.  All right, see you soon. ",
