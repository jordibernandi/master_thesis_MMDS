            "text": "Good afternoon, everybody.  This is Steve Fletcher with the Trumpet for My People.  And today is September 26, 2019.  And I wanted to share something with you that happened three years ago.  When this happened over Israel, this was an amazing sign in the heavens, amazing moment when all of Israel and throughout the world, they were talking about the trumpets that were sounding over Jerusalem with this amazing sign in the heavens.  So I want to replay this video for you and then share some details about 2019 and how this may be connected to the Feast of Trumpets 2019.  Thank you.  Whoa.  Whoa.  So what was most amazing about this, beyond just this supernatural sign in the heavens and the sounds of the trumpets, is the fact that, number one, it was over Israel, and number two, it was October 1st, 2016.  October 1st, 2016.  We have shared about the parable of the fig tree.  Now, what is very interesting is that the fig tree is a specific sign for Israel.  So these trumpets over Israel, October 1st, 2016, and then we look at the parable of the fig tree.  And it says, then he told this parable.  A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.  So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, for three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any.  Cut it down.  Why should it use up the soil?  So the parable of the fig tree goes on to talk about an intercession that takes place in another delay or another year.  that is added.  But at this stage of the game, we really have no idea if there could be any more delays based on everything that we are seeing.  We've seen the Revelation 12 sign two years ago.  We've seen all the signs that took place four years ago.  And a three-year sign from October 1st.  If you look at the dates of the fall holidays, September 30th through October 1st is the Feast of Trumpets this year.  So this is an amazing sign that took place exactly three years to the day to the Feast of Trumpets.  Number one, it's over Israel.  Number two, it's trumpets in the heavens.  Number three, it's exactly three years to the day to the Feast of Trumpets 2019.  And I think this is another reason to see that we are so important.  We are in such an important time right now.  that leading up between now and the Feast of Trumpets, September 30th, October 1st, is such an important time.  And I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've been waiting for so long and we don't want to have more deception or more disappointment.  We.  But at the same time, it's like as I could look at the possibilities of how there could be more delays, why we might be here till the end of the year or even into next year.  I mean, there are things that are going to happen at the end of this year, even the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, which takes place on the winter solstice of 2020.  And that might be a connection to the Revelation 12 sign and the man-child being devoured by Saturn, Jupiter and Saturn, and the conjoining of Jupiter and Saturn, the great conjunction that is going to take place on the winter solstice of 2020.  And... I want to be prepared emotionally if that is the case, if we do end up needing to wait.  But at the same time, I don't want to lose the excitement of the great possibility that we are right now.  We are right now on the cusp.  We're right now at the moment.  We're right now in the blink of an eye at any moment right now.  Rapture is imminent.  It could be this week.  It could be today or tomorrow or the next day.  It could be exactly on the Feast of Trumpets.  And this amazing sign that took place in Israel, October 1st, 2016, a three-year warning to the Feast of Trumpets, October 1st, 2019.  Trumpets in the heavens over Israel.  So this is what I wanted to share with you today.  And I just want to stay excited.  I want to find a way to stay excited because this weight is killing me.  This weight is killing me.  It really is.  It's just getting overwhelming.  It's just getting overwhelming.  But I want to stay encouraged and I want to help encourage anyone else I can that we need to keep our sights open.  To the heavens, look up.  Our redemption draws nigh.  Many, many signs are pointing to the time that we're in right now.  So I pray you are blessed.  And this is Steve Fletcher with a trumpet for my people.  The sign of his coming revealed. ",
