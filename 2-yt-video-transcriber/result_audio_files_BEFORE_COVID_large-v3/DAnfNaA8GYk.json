            "text": "Janet Yellen told me there'd be days like this.  Top of the morning to you.  Or evening.  Or wherever you are in the world.  Well, today was a special gift for me.  Getting to see the Dow Jones drop almost 500 points in a single trading session.  The reason why that's such a gift for me is because for some strange reason, today I had several people show up on my channel and start trolling a video that I made about three months ago about the stock market tanking.  And these people out there, they're not even qualified investors.  They just throw their money at the stock market and they think because the market's gone up for the last 10 years that it's going to go up forever.  And they're like fanboys.  And they have no logic or rational thought.  And so they get emotionally attached to the market.  and they come on my channel and start trolling me saying I'm wrong about everything.  well once again I was proven right.  today stock market dropped almost 500 points.  and no this is not happening based on suspicion or you know strange spirits or bad luck.  this is all based on fundamental things happening in the economy and the markets and the monetary system in America and around the globe.  okay that is causing a global economic slowdown and I'm planning my flag right now and I'm saying it the recession is here.  we're already in one.  I'm gonna prove it to you right now.  so aside from the fact that no one should be arrogantly investing in the stock market thinking they know what's gonna happen tomorrow just check out what happened today the first time since 2007 and anybody with any historical perspective knows what 2007 means to the history of financial markets and what happened just a year or two later.  but here we go.  it finally happened the yield curve.  three month bills t-note has inverted.  if it stays that way on average for a quarter history suggests we see a recession within 18 months.  okay New York Times article Bloomberg the yield curve is inverted a reminder of why you should care.  The yield curve inverted in 89, 2000, and in 2006.  Recessions occurred in 1990, 2001, and 2008.  So the yield curve is when a short-term treasury note yields more of a return on investment than a long-term treasury note.  And that spells doom for the economy because that means that People who put their money in longer are going to get less money back, so why would you?  Right?  You would only invest in things that produce more money, which would be a short-term bill, a short-term treasury note.  And this has always been an indicator of a recession, but let's just move on to a couple more indicators.  FedEx, Federal Express, Global Shipping Magnate, okay?  The canary in the coal mine for uh... all things commerce on an international scale.  fedex reported declining international revenue as a result of unfavorable exchange rates and the negative effects of trade battles whatever.  okay i don't think it's just a trade battle that's causing this and i'll get to that in a second.  slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue As seen in the year-over-year decline in our FedEx international revenue.  See, it's worldwide.  It's a global slowdown.  Weaker than expected third quarter earnings and revenue.  And this article is dated just two or three days ago.  Moving on, the retail apocalypse.  Retail apocalypse continues.  Gap, Family Dollar, thousands of other stores will close this year.  So I read a ridiculous article on Forbes about a year ago where some person who contributed an editorial said, you know, it's not that bad that Sears is closing down and JCPenney is closing down and Gap is closing down and all these other stores are closing down.  After all, the dollar store is expanding at a record rate.  I mean, that's totally laughable, right?  If your higher-end stores like Macy's are shutting down and more dollar stores are opening, that's not a good sign for the economy.  That's not a good sign for the consumer.  But even now, there's like $300 stores they're going to have to shut down this year.  And so the knee-jerk reaction to this is to blame online sales.  But I happen to be in online sales, and I can tell you that the year-over-year increase in online sales is not enough to account for all the retail store closings.  And what do you know?  Alibaba growth hits three-year low.  shoppers trim big-ticket buys and this is dated just two months ago.  so Alibaba they may be the biggest e-commerce platform or second to Amazon I'm not sure but they're a big one that's definitely for sure.  and so they hit a three-year low.  oh now let's PayPal.  PayPal sells miss estimates for the first time since 2015.  Oh, wow.  Of course, you know what this means, right?  It means our economy's never been stronger.  A little sarcasm for you there.  So the online sales are also slacking up.  And if online sales were accounting for the retail closures, then FedEx would not be reporting a global slowdown and they would not be missing earnings, okay?  They would be making more money, actually.  So what's happening in other parts of the economy?  Housing market crisis 2.0.  The jury is in.  so this guy David Haggith he says that it's.  what is different this time from 2007 to 2009. crisis is that it started in the US and pretty much stayed in the US.  however this one is developing all over the world at the same time US Canada Australia the UK alright.  so housing sales are crashing people cannot afford to buy a new house.  it just isn't happening and the the wages are not there.  But just like they said, you know, it's the trade battles that are causing this.  It's not true.  Look, the global debt bubble could be about to explode.  Okay, debt levels around the world are at historical highs.  This is not true anymore.  Central banks are reducing liquidity.  Actually, now they're increasing liquidity.  Three monkeys from the Federal Reserve were paraded around on 60 Minutes recently, put in front of the viewing public, okay, to try to keep Americans in their comatose stupor just that much longer, telling them the economy's fine, everything's doing great, nothing to worry about.  And you can just tell by their body language and their facial expressions that they are full of it.  And whenever the mainstream media owned by the tribe runs their tribe members, and the Federal Reserve Bank system is definitely an arm of the global tribe network under the Rothschild banking system from Europe.  whenever they parade those monkeys in front of you and try to convince you everything's great that's when you know everything is not great.  just remember ben bernanke.  um right before the massive housing market crisis and then the stock market crash 2006 2007 2008 he said everything's great.  we predict everything's gonna just be fine and dandy.  and how did that work out for everyone?  well we all know how that worked out.  so i sit here And I look at this and it fills my heart with joy because while I don't really want anybody to lose money out there, what you have to realize is that unless you sell the stocks you hold, you don't have any money.  it's all on paper it's all ones and zeros until you actually sell.  so people who think oh this is just another buying opportunity.  hey keep thinking that okay and see how that works out for you.  meanwhile gold and silver are at all-time lows.  they have found support and their prices are completely stable.  silver had a run up to about forty five dollars in 2011 and the experts are saying that silver is in high demand low supply and gold and silver are both ready for a massive breakout to the upside.  you have to understand that gold and silver have been used for money for the last five thousand years and they always will be Used for money and they will always have value.  Silver has industrial applications and gold has more than just monetary applications.  Okay, and the greatest thing about gold and silver is Central banks cannot just print a bunch of it and tell you what it's worth.  All right Now I do recommend everybody out there Okay Take some of your money and, okay, this is just opinion.  This is not investment advice, but this is what I would do if I were you.  You know, if you have $1,000 saved up, why not buy some silver with that, you know, from appmex.com, okay?  Or, you know, if you have more than that, you can buy gold, all right?  And this is stuff you can keep with you if you have a safe hiding place for it.  Gold and silver... have nowhere to go.  but up and in the midst of all of these horrible economic reports and another day where the stock market bled 460 points like it was nothing.  and now the Federal Reserve has a reverse course on its promises to raise interest rates and now they don't even know when they're going to raise them again and maybe they're going to start quantitative easing part four and start printing even more money.  don't you think gold and silver might be something good to have at this point?  now if you want to invest more than just a thousand dollars or a couple thousand dollars into gold and silver you can also invest in a gold IRA or you can have a rollover from your current IRA or 401k into a gold IRA.  I will put a link below which you can click on and receive a free gold IRA investing kit for qualified investors who have 10k or more to invest into a gold IRA or to roll over from their existing 401k IRA or Roth IRA.  If you want to check that out, you can.  I'm putting the link below.  It's no obligation, completely free.  And I think even if you don't have 10K to invest, they'll send you an electronic version of the actual physical kit, which they would send you if you had more than 10K to invest in that.  But in any case... if you're interested in gold or silver, just do a Google search, you know, find out, um, you know, what our gold IRA qualified metals, you know, you can always visit appmex.com and buy some silver rounds.  You can get like 20 silver rounds for probably, uh, 300 bucks, three or 400 bucks.  Um, that's a good place to start.  And you know, with the amount of money they're printing, with the amount of data manipulation and statistics that they are finding creative ways to cover up the true nature of inflation.  Gold and silver are just, they're the only things left to invest in that haven't been ruined and run into the ground.  Everything else is basically a fool's gamble at this point.  Housing market, done.  Stock market, completely overvalued, totally volatile, and it needs, I don't know, financial heroin just to stay alive.  It's like a junkie fighting to stay awake so it can do more drugs.  And these valuations do not reflect the true state of the economy.  One last thing, and this is something interesting that I saw the other day on another video on YouTube, and that is the Big Mac Index.  And this gives you the true indication of how much inflation is occurring in the economy.  And the Big Mac Index is the price of a Big Mac from McDonald's at any given year in history.  And so 10 years ago, a Big Mac costs something like $3.60.  And now a Big Mac costs around $5.80, I want to say.  So the price of a Big Mac has almost doubled.  While the Federal Reserve and the mainstream media and all the experts on Wall Street, you know, the people with the billions of dollars who don't even care, you know, they don't care what a 12-piece McNugget costs.  They can, you know, they could swim in a pool of chicken McNuggets tomorrow if they wanted to.  But for the average person who has to actually pay bills and take care of their families and send their kids to school and they have to watch every penny and watch all of their expenses.  you know the fact that a big mac has almost doubled in price in just 10 years is very telling of the true state of the consumer's spending power.  so just keep all this in mind moving forward and do what you can now to protect yourself because the dow jones is at 25 500 at this point which means if you rode the stock market all the way up to this point okay you still have time to collect those winnings from the casino and put it into something better at this point.  or you know you can ignore the fact that the bear market rally is over and you know you can hope that the stock market is going to go up even more but it's almost impossible to time the market.  so why not pull some money off of the table?  why not cash in some of your winnings you know converted into either cash or you know gold and silver.  put it in a gold IRA.  do something besides just sitting and waiting and thinking.  you know that this is going to continue forever because that normalcy bias will kill your investment portfolio.  thinking that everything is just going to stay the same is what causes people to lose money.  so don't just hold on blindly out of faith.  don't be emotionally attached to the market.  make good decisions and i wish you the best thanks for watching this video and i will see you all on the next one.  take care.
