And in a fiat system, you always have to have credit always has to expand.  It goes back to Richard Russell's inflate or die.  And what we've seen for the last 10 plus years since the 2008 crisis has been one central bank after another, you'll see them expand their money supply, expand the sovereign treasury, will expand the amount of debt up to a point, and then they pass the baton off to another central bank.  The US Fed started in 2008 or 2009 with QE1, they did QE2, and then you had, expansive policy through the Central Bank, a reflation by the Japanese Central Bank and the European Central Bank.  Then you had China.  And the hope has been that China would again reflate late this past year, hand in hand with the Fed or this coming year.  And at this point, China has reached debt saturation.  You're starting to see even state-owned enterprises not make their, not make the debt service payments.  So the fact that they've hit credit or debt saturation means they're not going to be able to expand credit and that credit impulse, the wave itself is not going to be pushing higher.  Without a credit impulse, Without credit, you will not see economies expand.  You'll see them start to decline.  And that's what we're seeing now.  You're seeing that all over the world.  You're seeing it with trade numbers.  At this point, it's not mainstream yet, but I think people are going to figure out fairly shortly that China not only not being able to increase credit, increase debt, but also you're starting to see ",

I want to ask you about\u2026.  Yeah, I want to ask you about the repo operations bill.  We've seen $400 billion added into the economy since September.  Many have seen the correlation between this and the stock market gaining so much.  We're seeing that the unwinding of the repo operations or the unwinding of the balance sheet will be very, very slow in 2020.  Basically, the Fed is going to keep lubricating the markets as it is right now.  And what's really interesting is that the transcripts were declassified from the 2014 meetings where Jerome Powell talked about the fact that one, the balance sheet being so large is, is a real problem because it creates an asset of a bond bubble, uh, for fixed income.  And then he also said that shrinking it, um, is going to cause a mess at some point.  And, and it was very prophetic because of what we saw in December of 2018.  Um, do you think that's why the fed is now, um, looking for ways to expand this elevated level of a balance sheet without shrinking it again?  Do you think that the repo operations basically will continue on, that they will ease indefinitely, stimulate indefinitely, never taking their foot off the gas for a tiny period again? ",

We went for years.  years, I don't know, three, four, five years, year after year, we would hear the Federal Reserve saying that they were going to normalize their balance sheet.  And all they did was take what four or 500 billion off the balance sheet.  And you had the the financial markets go into a complete temper tantrum at the end of 2018.  So they realized they can't They can never shrink the balance sheet.  And Powell knew this back, obviously, in 2012 and 2014 when those Fed minutes were taken.  So here we are six, seven, eight years later.  He's running the show, and he already knows that they can't normalize the balance sheet.  I mean, he knew then, and obviously end of 2018 showed him He was right.  You mentioned that the balance sheet has increased by 400 billion.  That's not from the repos.  That's balance sheet expansion.  The repos, theoretically, the repos are supposed to be repaid every night.  How do we know that they're not continually rolled over?  The fact that the Fed has to come up with, call it $100 billion every single night, Otherwise, there's a big problem.  And I guess yesterday or the day before, they offered $82 billion, and that was oversubscribed.  Something has already broken in the background.  What or who it is, we don't know.  But you can know that something has broken.  And the danger, of course, is that it's a big counterparty with derivatives.  That would be a problem. ",
