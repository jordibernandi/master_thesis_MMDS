            "text": "The Jussie Smollett hoax crime takes a sad, pathetic detour of justice.  Cook County, Chicago, Obama officials have dropped all charges against Jussie Smollett on his hoax and fraud charges that the Chicago police brought against him.  Now we need to ask some important questions.  Did Valerie Jarrett and Obama pull strings to get these charges dropped?  Was there a backroom money deal to get these charges dropped?  And how mad are the folks on the Chicago police force that did all their hard work to bring this case to justice?  Did the prosecutor and her team have secret meetings with Valerie Jarrett?  Does Jussie have a history of lying to the police?  And do the rich get away with crimes in America?  These are all very serious and important questions we need to ask.  And can the poor get a fair shake in a system like this in America?  So, Before we go any further, what does Rahm Emanuel think about the Jussie Smollett whitewash cover-up?  Well, listen up.  Our officers did hard work day in and day out, countless hours, working to upwind what actually happened that night.  The city saw its reputation.  dragged through the mud.  But I remind everybody it was not just the officer's work.  That work, a piece of that work, was shown to a grand jury.  And they made a decision based on only a sliver of the evidence.  And if I remember correctly, somebody wanted to have that evidence in the day, as the superintendent said, their day in court so all the evidence could be made public.  Because of the judge's decision, none of that evidence will ever be made public.  None of it.  This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice and sends a clear message that if you're in a position of influence and power, you'll get treated one way.  Other people will be treated another way.  There is no accountability then in the system.  It is wrong, full stop.  And you may be asking yourself about now, I mean, Rahm Emanuel, wasn't he the guy that used to tell Obama what to do?  That was back then, before Valerie Jarrett took over.  So, how much did Jussie have to cough up to get those hoax charges dropped in the Windy City?  Apparently, $100,000.  But wait!  Now, Jussie had to pay 10% of the $100,000 bail, so we know for sure that Jussie had to pay $10,000.  But who or what paid for the additional $90,000?  That's a good question that only the bail bondsman could answer if Obama let him.  And now we know that there's a new player in the game, Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow Push nonprofit coalition.  So did Jesse Jackson personally supervise Jussie?  during these two days of so-called community service?  Or was it possible that all Jussie was doing was signing autographs for the Rainbow Push Coalition patrons of honor?  It really is amazing how the liberal left progressives worship the Hollywood scum.  It's sort of pathetic.  So here on this segment, we're only going to name the players in this lurid tale of corruption.  But first, before we expose the gang members, I would like to pose a serious question.  Let's pretend for one moment that there was a real assault that took place.  We're just pretending, of course.  Would there be a powerful political gang out there that would push for these criminals to get off with a big $100,000 fine or payoff and do no jail time?  I mean, I doubt it.  I mean, we can all agree on that.  The people would have went to jail if it had been true.  The criminals would have went to jail.  And plus, there would have been a big fine also, a combination of both.  And you already know about the civil asset forfeitures fiasco, you know, where they take all your shit.  So, I mean, does this play into the equation?  Of course it does.  So why don't we name the players in this gang of criminals?  First, we have Obama and his clan.  They are gang leaders, okay?  And then we do have Jesse Jackson.  He's the Rainbow Coalition man.  And Jesse Jackson is like, he's a preacher shill for the gang leaders.  And next we have Valerie Jarrett.  She's an underboss in the gang.  And you'll notice from the photos that these people all travel in the same circles.  You and I are not invited.  And then you may not have heard of this lady.  Her name is Tina Tichen, and she is like a concierge, an advisor.  You know, she's like one of the smart people out of the liberal left, and there's not very many of them.  And as you can see, she's, well, she's traveling in these circles.  Next, we have Kim Fox.  She's the prosecutor, Cook County.  She's an enforcer in the gang, or in this case, she's a protector.  Now, one of the players that is unknown, I do not have the name, but I guess I should put it in here, is the judge that was in on the grand jury.  Now, somehow this judge had a part in this cover-up.  Was it willingly or unwillingly?  I don't know.  But we do need to understand that judges are a big part of the equation.  And, of course, we don't want to leave out the actor because he's very important in the whole show.  Of course, Jussie Smollett, he gets the best director and the best actor award for this whole hoax.  I mean, it's really, really, well, we're going to dig further.  But this is as far as we're going to go in this segment, part one.  Now, in part two, we're going to analyze the players.  this hoax cover-up.  We're going to do that on the main channel. ",
