If you're in court and someone pays you fine, even though you're guilty, the judge can let you go.  He can say, Jessica's guilty.  Someone's paid a fine.  She's out of here.  Well, the good news of the gospel is God can let you go.  He can dismiss your case, forgive your sins, commute your death sentence, because that's what you're under at the moment.  The Bible says the soul that sins, it shall die, okay?  I know you think this is funny.  I don't.  This is deadly serious because you could die tonight. ",
