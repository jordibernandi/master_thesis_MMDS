            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  It's the Kiwi here with the follow-up video to the video that I did a couple of weeks ago on why life is a struggle for a lot of us actually.  So in the first video, I spoke about how at a cellular and molecular and energy level, we become pre-programmed by our parents and our parents' family, the circle of family around those parents and their friends, and then the societal belief systems or the societal norms that go on around a community or a society.  Now, the amazing thing is, is after the next few years, we're actually dropped off and dumped into the education system or what I like to call the indoctrination system.  And it really truly is an indoctrination system.  And it's more so that way today than it's ever been before in the history or in current history.  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you a quote that has been credited to a Jesuit general from the 1400s.  And some credit has also been apparently given to Voltaire.  So it kind of shows you that... People knew about what I'm talking about hundreds, if not thousands of years ago, before we had all this science and all this technology and all this way to study the quantum field and see how everything works, right?  Because this knowledge is in even ancient religions, ancient beliefs, esoteric belief systems today.  However, it's being used against us.  It's being used against you.  It's being used against me.  And it's still being used against us.  Ad nauseum today.  But anyway, the quote goes thus.  Give me the boy for the first seven years, and I will give you the man.  Now, that was credited, like I said, to either Voltaire or this Jesuit general from the 1400s.  Now, the Jesuits were charged with the protection of the Pope, and not just the protection of the Pope, but then what later became, or what is known today as the Catholic Church.  And the Jesuits were basically a small army of men and they were brought about by specific noble families in Europe, in Italy, and around that part of Europe, you know, thousands of years ago.  One of those families... today can still trace their lineage back to actually around Caesar's Rome.  So we're looking at a group of people who have been aware of this knowledge for potentially thousands of years, as are the majority of royal or noble families throughout Europe, and the British royal family also actually being one of those families.  So... The amazing thing about this stuff is that I've always looked at Catholicism, Christianity, as these religions as kind of like the first real global corporations.  Because what these individuals did, these groups of people did, is they went around the world spreading the Word of God, right?  And that Word of God was basically... Either you repent your sins, believe in Jesus Christ the Savior, or we'll fucking kill you.  I mean, that was it.  Look at what the Catholics did in South America.  I mean, it was freaking... It was horrendous what the Catholics did in South America.  You know, they absolutely slaughtered millions of people all in the name of... you know, Jesus.  And Christianity did the same thing.  The British royals, through their systems, they, you know, brought about carnage also.  And when you start to see a picture starting to form, because what you start to see is that The religions or the churches were the first form of tax collection.  And as the populations got bigger, the churches and the royal families realized that they couldn't just run an area or a country based on a church system.  They had to implement governments.  Now, when you look at the root word of what govern meant means, it literally means control mind.  Govern, control, meant, mind.  So, governments were literally put in place after the churches and the religions were brought in.  And... They were utilized to control the minds of people.  Religion was the first major form of control over people.  Then came the governments.  Religions and churches, like I said, were also the first form of tax collection.  Then it was passed off to the governments.  Then the governments started getting their hands into the education system.  And that's where the indoctrination really, truly started.  And this started happening hundreds of years ago.  And they slowly, between the governments with their education systems and then the religions, with the religious belief systems, you ended up having a completely and utterly indoctrinated society.  You know, best way to keep people running on the hamster wheel of life is to let them know that if they don't do X, Y, and Z, they're going to burn in hell.  You know, look at what your ancestors were doing.  They were doing X, Y, and Z and weren't following our path and they burnt in hell.  They all got slaughtered and killed.  You know?  Don't know what to tell you.  So... Once they started getting their hands on the education system, that's when the indoctrination really, really started.  The whole purpose behind the modern day education system or indoctrination system is literally just to turn out dutiful minions.  That's it.  Just good people that will get on the hamster wheel of life, not question anything and just produce.  and produce and produce and spend their money.  They'll get paid a certain amount of money.  Part of that money goes in taxes off to those individuals.  It all filters back to the same people over and over and over again.  And they want you buying into this materialistic world.  They want you to go out and get married.  They want you to produce more children.  Because if you produce more children, guess what happens?  You actually produce more minions that will get on the treadmill and keep this world rolling.  It's one of the most mind-blowingly... Sick things I think you could ever possibly look at.  I remember being in Camarillo, California, up on the Conejo grade, looking down onto the town.  And all I saw was a baby factory.  That's all Camarillo was.  Thousands of homes with married people parked and them popping out babies.  Just a fucking baby factory.  That's all it is.  And when you start looking at the world like that and you start taking a step back, you're just like, oh my God, this is absolutely disgusting.  It's like we are so far away from the path that we should be living, it's absolutely mind-blowing.  So the struggle for so many of us starts to come about because we've been put on this path.  We've been put on this path, told a lie, And everything about our lives is a lie.  We've never been taught or told how to go down our path in life.  What makes us the happiest?  What makes us sing?  These people, these families, they know this knowledge.  They know this esoteric wisdom.  I've studied some of these esoteric religions and beliefs, these old, old, old belief systems, right?  And I've also read Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma.  And that's the... handbook, the Bible, for the Freemasons in the United States.  And I see so much of these wonderful ancient esoteric teachings and beliefs in the Freemasons' handbook.  However, you start to realize that in today's society, the Masons The upper level of the Masons are actually using that knowledge against us.  They are actually perpetuating this bullshit.  When you realize that these people that are in power, like, you know, for argument's sake, like Jacinda Ardern, she considers herself here in New Zealand a self-professed Freemason, okay?  And look at what happened with this shooting in Christchurch down here.  Within days of that shooting, they've got gun control.  They're coming down on free speech.  They're taking away New Zealanders' freedoms step by step by step.  That's not in the Masonic Lodge handbook.  What they are doing today is they're using this knowledge against us.  And it goes all the way up through the media and everything.  It goes everywhere.  And the amazing thing about it, the thing that blows me away is how indoctrinated a population becomes that they will listen to these individuals and literally believe every word that's coming out of their mouths.  And it just freaking stuns me.  It's like, are people this?  Yeah, they really are.  This stupid.  That's how strong the indoctrination is.  And when you start trying to talk to people about this stuff, they look at you like, dude, you're some sort of wacko or lunatic or what have you.  It's like, no, this shit's been going on for thousands of years.  You know, these families, these people at the top of the pile, these supposed illuminated ones, they just stand back now and just let everything flow.  It just works perfectly.  I mean, it really, really does.  Oh, by the way, I'm not a Mason.  Just because I've got that book doesn't mean I'm a Mason.  I'm not.  I'm from a Masonic family, but I steered well clear of it.  I don't need... A real man doesn't need any sort of crutch to stand on.  He doesn't need a brotherhood.  He doesn't need religion.  All he needs is his freedom.  That's what real men... desire in life is pure freedom.  So anyway, but the amazing thing is that you have these people in positions like Hollywood actors, actresses, movie stars, singers, and they get perpetuated up onto a pedal stool.  So they can become the mouthpieces for these people behind them or above them to perpetuate this belief that if you're not living this way, you're a zero.  If you're not doing this this way, you're a loser.  If you don't have a house or drive a certain car or living a certain way, you're a loser.  If you're not doing any of these things, you're a loser.  So what happens is we get pressured into living this life.  And that's where the struggle becomes.  I've lived that struggle myself.  I wanted it all.  And I got it all.  And it was like, oh my God, I don't want this.  And finally, at a certain point, it all collapsed down around me.  And it took a while for me to get used to having that world collapse around me.  But once I actually started to actually see what was going on and see what was happening, when everything collapsed, it kind of... You know, the mountain collapsed around me and beyond the mountain was the real world.  And I was just saying, oh my gosh, wow, there is a whole nother world beyond this mountain.  Because everybody's wanting to climb the mountain.  Everybody's wanting to get to the top of the hill.  Everybody gets taught or told to climb the mountain, but the few people that get to the top of the mountain don't know how to get down.  They've used everything they've got to get to the top of the mountain.  Every ounce of their soul, their life force, everything to get to the top of the mountain.  They get there, oh fuck, what do I do?  I've got to get down.  More people die coming down off Everest than going up Everest.  Think about that for a minute.  Everybody trains to get to the top of Everest.  How many people train to get down?  So, once life for me... Once all that materialism started to wash away, life actually started to get better for me.  And I started to see through this system.  I started to see why life was a struggle.  I started to see how much of life was an actual lie.  And it's an incredible life.  I see it all around me every day.  So what I'm going to do in the next video, I'm going to talk in greater detail about how to get your life going on the path.  There's certain key indicators in our lives that tell us what we should be doing.  Not what these assholes want us doing.  Because this is Groundhog Day.  This can be just absolute misery.  However, there are indicators and things that go on in our lives that are telling you.  It's like you're getting smacked up the side of the head, like, dude, wake up.  You need to start going down this path.  But yeah, it's really interesting because everybody always sells materialism.  Materialism, materialism, materialism.  And for so many of us, the lack of materialism actually brings about a far greater level of happiness.  And that's where I'm at personally.  So outside of that... That's the video.  I'll be back with the heads up and the pointers that work for me.  I don't know if it'll work for you.  But, you know, hopefully some of it might help.  So anyway, if you like this video, give it a thumbs up, pound the subscribe button.  Talk to you later.  Cheers. ",
