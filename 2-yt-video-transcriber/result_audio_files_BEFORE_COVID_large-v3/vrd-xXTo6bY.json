            "text": "When Satan gives you something to look at, that's the opportunity to do something that I like to call cry out to God, and it goes just like this.  Help!  Oh, y'all like the amen kind of conference, but you should have said amen right there.  It's the idea that if I'm not being fixated with my vision on the things of God, if the leader is not busy keeping his spirit's eyes enamored by the beauty of Christ, the leader's flesh will quickly find another option.  And so no wonder the songwriter said, turn your eyes upon Jesus.  Look full in his wonderful face and the things of earth will go strangely dim the light of his glory and grace.  It's the idea of this, believer.  every day, every minute, every morning, every meeting, every workshop, every thrive conference, everything you go to, you need to be saying, Lord, fix my eyes.  Underline that word see in the Texas, the Hebrew word rah.  Rah is not just to look at, it's to look into.  See, God doesn't hold you for a glance.  God's saying the trouble is the stare.  God's saying to Achan, Achan, I gave you eyes to look at stuff.  The problem is when you start to study it.  The word ra'ak literally means to consider, to inspect, and to enjoy.  Achan wasn't looking at the cloak.  Achan was looking at the cloak.  And God's saying it's the look, leader.  It's the look of what.  maybe I should use my know-how to maneuver through this problem in my church.  Maybe I should use the monopolization of my own power and my own strategies instead of humility.  Maybe I should just kind of fly this church on my gifting alone instead of depending on the power of the Holy Spirit.  It's not the glance, it's when you stare at it.  That gets you in trouble, okay?  So, it's coming then upon the leader when Satan starts to give you stuff and options to look at.  I'm just telling you, you got to get crazy.  I don't care if you're in the middle of Walgreens and you get an option from the devil.  Boys, girls, I'm just telling you, that's the moment when you stop right there and say, help!  Like, it needs to be more timeouts in our private studies and in our offices.  You need to start going to the bathroom even more, not for one or two, but to say, help!  Help!  And God says, when you invite me in at that level.  I'll give you victory at that level, and you don't have to worry about the defeat of the remaining levels.  It starts with your eyes.  My wife has given me permission to tell this story, but I remember going to the gym, and that morning I got up, and I was in God's Word, and man, I got full of the Spirit, you know what I'm saying?  And I'm in my coffee shop, and I'm in my journal.  I'm just talking to the Lord, and you know, I even spoke in tongues a little bit, and I'm And I'm just talking to the Lord and having a good old time, getting full of His Spirit.  And then I go to the gym, because I like to go to the gym and look, you know.  And so I head over to the gym, and I'm just doing my thing, minding my own business, okay?  Still just high off the Lord and just walking in the Spirit, and I'm just doing my curls, you know what I'm saying?  So it's just me and the junkyard dog and Roddy Roddy Piper doing our stuff, minding our own business.  Fellas, yonder she comes.  And, you know, just a young sister, you know, uncircumcised Philistine comes in front of me, and I'm just keeping it real.  You ain't got to have me back, okay?  But, you know, she's got the... Okay?  Amen?  And she's right there.  And, you know, she's doing this medieval kind of stuff.  You know, she's all like this with hers, like, you know, like all that, right in front of me.  And here I am thinking to myself, I just got through talking to Jesus.  I just got through keeping my mind stayed on Jesus.  And I'm like, Jesus, help me.  And to be honest, y'all, I was kind of mad at God.  I'm like, God, I was up there.  I did.  I listened to Kirk Franklin and Lincoln Brewster this morning.  Why are you tempting me with this, God?  And I just have to keep it real.  I'm like, God, I don't want to just glance.  Lord, I'm tempted now to consider.  God, I'm tempted to inspect.  God, I'm tempted to enjoy.  And there she is, and here I am.  And there she is, and here I am.  I'm like, Jesus, you've got to help me.  Jesus, you've got to help me.  Jesus, you've got to help me.  The Holy Spirit came down, y'all, and said, turn around, fool.  Turn around.  Y'all, I finished my set.  I went to the other side of the gym to work out next to the ugliest people I could find.  Starts with your eyes.  Jesus says you fight at your eyes, I'll give you victory at your eyes.  Jesus says, you invite me into your eyes, I'll turn around your eyes and fix them on me.  Jesus says, just invite me, leader.  Invite me where the fight really is, and I'll give you victory every time. ",
