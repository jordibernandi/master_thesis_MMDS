            "text": "Hello and welcome to my channel!  Vicerino here!  If you follow me on Twitter, you're probably already aware of what's going on between Mr.  Atheist and Pastor Tommy McMurtry, or at the very least you've seen all the pumpkins flying around Twitter and are wondering why everybody is going Halloween-themed at the beginning of summer.  Well, I'm going to give you a brief explanation here.  The New IFB Church, if you're not familiar with it, is where we get the likes of Steven Anderson and Matt Powell, who my regular viewers will be relatively familiar with.  On the website thenewifb.com, it explains that they are not a denomination, they're a movement where each individual pastor submits himself to the Word of God.  which I guess means that any pastor of any denomination could claim to be new IFB, you know, since they're not a denomination and all that.  Then they have a list of beliefs that are required in order to belong to this not-denomination, so they're not very internally consistent right out of the gates.  Their beliefs are amusing to read through.  For instance, they only accept the King James Bible as valid, because nuance in translation is not a thing in their minds, except when the KJV says things that are obviously absurd, as when it talks about unicorns.  Then you can bring up translational nuance.  So they have to explain why the inerrant word of an omniscient and omnipotent god used the name of a mythical creature instead of a word like ox or rhinoceros that other translations use.  They are also of the once-saved-always-saved mindset, which is good news for me, as there was a time when I believed in the gospel message with all my heart.  So I win Pascal's wager by living my life as an atheist, but still going to heaven because I was saved once early on.  But all of that is irrelevant.  This is the denomination, and let's call a spade a spade here.  It's split off from its parent church because of a disagreement about doctrine.  It's a denomination.  But you're probably most familiar with it because of their hard stance against homosexuality.  They do things like equate homosexuality with pedophilia and bestiality, and they celebrate things like the Pulse nightclub shootings, and they're holding a rally during Pride Week in Florida called Make America Straight Again.  They spend so much time and energy thinking about men being sexual with other men that it really makes one wonder about their sexuality.  But on to the pumpkins.  Jimmy Snow of the channel Dear Mr.  Atheist did a video responding to a video put out by the Liberty Baptist Church of Rock Falls, Illinois, where they were promoting their Make America Straight Again conference.  As a direct result of Jimmy's video, their video was removed from YouTube for violating their terms of service with regards to hate speech.  They didn't take this very well, so they responded with one of their own videos, where some of the first words of the video are, I don't want to name this guy because I don't want to give him any more publicity.  I don't want to name this guy because I don't want to give him any more publicity.  but hypocritically, they name him in the title of their video.  In this video, they are very hateful toward Jimmy, and they give him a derogatory nickname of Mr.  Pumpkin because the pumpkin is the biggest fruit on Earth.  Jimmy has decided that he will take ownership of the nickname, and in a video that I will link to, he explains what he wants to accomplish with his response.  In a nutshell, he's using the fact that he has a much larger following than Pastor Tommy McMurtry.  in order to minimize the amount of reach that McMurtry has.  Jimmy has purchased tommymcmurtry.com, and if you go there now, you'll see a whole collection of pumpkin-related art, much of it sexy pumpkin art.  Jimmy has also put together a video compilation of several YouTubers, myself included, Stating that we aren't saying that Pastor McMurtry is sexually attracted to pumpkins, we just don't know.  The plan is to make a Google search for Tommy McMurtry or the church he's associated with, come up with Jimmy's video and the TommyMcMurtry.com website before it brings up any hate speech that McMurtry puts out.  So far he's succeeded in getting this video to come first, but the website's not quite there yet.  Now, ordinarily, I would be against this kind of move.  It kind of furthers the Christian persecution narrative.  You can bet your ass that McMurtry will be preaching today about how he's being picked on by this mean atheist pumpkin, and how the Bible says Christians will be persecuted, therefore he must be doing God's work by preaching his hate message.  But when it comes to a denomination as despicable as the NIFB, I think making it harder for them to get their message out is a good thing.  If you disagree, I understand, but I fully support Jimmy in this effort.  And as a nice little bonus that Jimmy didn't mention in his video, the Liberty Baptist Church of Rock Falls, Illinois has a Facebook page that allows reviews.  It's only got 25 right now, but we've brought it down from 5 stars to 2.2 stars as of this writing, and I certainly wouldn't shed any tears over it being brought down further.  One thing I will say though is please do not do anything that could be considered threats or harassment.  The only thing Jimmy is trying to do is make them and their message of hate less visible.  Let's be better than them.  Thanks for watching, check the video description for the relevant links, and see you next time. ",
