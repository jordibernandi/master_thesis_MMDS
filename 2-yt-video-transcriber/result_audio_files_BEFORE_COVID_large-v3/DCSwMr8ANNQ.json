            "text": "Good morning, good morning, because we're rotoro.com with your morning horn of tea.  Tea.  um let's dig in.  we're in.  we're in december we're in a hot month so we're gonna dig in all month.  lots of posts lots of analysis.  let's catch up.  um first let's catch up on deutsche bank.  they are under attack again by the u.s government.  one of the world's largest derivative holders is under attack again at the worst time possible.  do you think they're trying to take down the system or what?  It's obvious.  Exclusive from Reuters.  Exclusive.  U.S.  digs deeper into Deutsche Roll in Dansk money laundering scandal, sources say.  The U.S.  Department of Justice has in recent weeks stepped up its investigation into Deutsche Bank's role in the 200 billion euro or 220 billion dollars Dansk Bank money laundering scandal, four people told Reuters.  What does that mean?  If one person tells them, if three, four, oh, four, it must be more real.  Probably they just don't want anybody honing in on who's leaking the information.  One source said that DOJ's new line of inquiry is whether Deutsche Bank helped move tainted money from Dansk, Denmark's largest lender, into the United States.  If proven, that could lead to steep financial penalties.  Here's the deal.  They know exactly what was going on.  They run the SWIFT system.  You can't transfer that kind of money without going through the SWIFT system.  They know every transaction, who, why, and where.  Go to your bank and try to pull out over $10,000 and see if they let you without crawling up your booty and knowing everything about that transaction.  They knew everything about the transaction.  The SWIFT system, the Federal Reserve Bank, the U.S.  Treasury.  They all knew.  The ECB, everybody knew.  So I find it interesting now that they're coming after them for something they've known since the very first transfer was made.  It's just, I mean, the stupidity of saying this was a surprise is ridiculous.  You can't transfer that kind of money without the SWIFT.  The people who control the SWIFT system, basically the U.S.  Treasury, knowing everything about it.  And the Federal Reserve System.  Officials from the DOJ, who have been working closely with Estonian prosecutors for around a year, have also begun cooperating with Frankfurt state prosecutors, the source said.  The Frankfurt prosecutors have been exploring Deutsche's role in processing payments for the Danish bank.  The DOJ's focus on Germany's largest bank and its work with Frankfurt prosecutors have not been previously reported.  It is such a joke.  And of course, Deutsche Bank has been saying the same thing for 20 years.  Quote, we have repeatedly stressed that we are in good and constructive exchange with the authorities.  They've been investigating Deutsche Bank for so long, but it's Germany's two biggest bank.  It's a too big to fail bank.  It's like if Deutsche Bank or JP Morgan went down for their rigging of the silver market.  At some point, they're all going down.  And then there'll be people to blame.  Then there'll be perp walks.  But right now, what do they do?  As the banks fail, which they are right now, they bail them out with overnight repos.  Overnight, overnight bailouts.  Now, not all of them overnight.  They've started doing the permanent repos, which I'll get to in a second.  But here's the latest.  This is the second tranche of a new repo.  Like I said, it's just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger, especially as we get near the end of the year, where they have to rig and jimmy their books by the end of the year.  Everything on their books has to be in line with all the rules and regulations.  You can do anything you want between quarter reportings.  But at the end of the year, everything's got to be in line with all the bank regulators.  And that's what's the problem.  They aren't in line, especially JP Morgan.  So what happens?  The Fed changes the rules as to how they report the interest rates.  Remember, interest rates jump in the repo market, jump to 10% overnight.  Remember that?  What did they do to fix the problem?  They didn't find the underlying problem.  They changed the way the problem was reported.  Now, if it jumps to 10%, they use an average and they're only going to record like 1% or 2% higher.  It is ridiculous.  It is a fraud.  The whole thing is a fraud.  As a matter of fact, the Fed... The Federal Reserve proposes a new rule to let inflation run hot.  So basically, they can't fix the problem.  They have to invent new ways to disguise the problem.  As the Federal Reserve remains unable to stoke inflation because it refuses to measure it correctly and refuses to factor in asset inflation, here's a great chart on Zero Hedge about asset inflation.  Look at the asset prices.  That is the inflation, but none of that is calculated in the inflation rate.  The real economy prices is basically what we have to live off, whereas the asset prices, all the investors and banksters get that stuff.  So you want to know where the inflation is going?  It's going into the S&P, the European HY, the USHY, MSCI World, all the stocks and bonds and a little bit in gold.  Of course, you're not allowed to talk about silver, by the way.  That's the latest thing.  They can't even talk about silver.  Right now, they're mining silver.  And I'm going to get into this today.  Later on today, I'm going to post something on silver and cryptos because it's been a while.  But silver is being mined at 8 to 1.  For every 1 ounce of gold, 8 ounces of silver is being mined.  That is what's being mined out of the ground, 8 to 1.  And ground reserves are very similar.  The only thing that is not 8 to 1 or in that range is the price because it's rigged on the comics.  as is evidenced by all the JP Morgan traders going under.  But they don't mention JP Morgan by name.  This is the biggest scandal in financial history.  150 years.  I believe the silver breakout, as in silver becomes almost freely traded, will happen before the crypto breakout.  Why?  Because silver is not a monetary metal anymore.  It's not.  And we're running out of silver.  It's one of the shortest term lifespan of all the elements according to the USGS model.  I think it's like 15 years.  Now, it keeps staying at 15 years because they keep finding more silver.  And as the silver price goes up, more reserves are calculated.  But they're not allowing the silver price to go up.  At $1,000 silver, it probably won't be 15 years.  It could be 150 years.  But it's not being allowed.  So all this silver is being consumed and thrown into electronics and these new smart cars and Tesla mobiles and you name it.  Silver is being used because it's so undervalued.  If you have any gold, you are insane.  Swap it for silver right now.  Gold?  No.  Silver?  Yes.  Hell of a lot more gold out there.  even if it gets to the normal ratio of 8 to 1.  You're going to, what's it, 80 to 1 right now?  You're going to make 10 times the amount of money you would if you held gold.  If you hold gold, you're giving up 10 times the amount of money by holding silver.  Obviously, when we hit the gold bull runs, silver performs much better than gold, and vice versa on the downswing.  It's all rigged.  Yes, I understand that.  But to not have silver and be overloaded in gold or have any gold at all?  Insanity.  At its finest.  Anyway.  Back to the new Fed plan.  It has now considered launching a new rule that would let inflation run above its 2% target to make up for its lost inflation, according to the Financial Times.  Though the Fed's policies are to protect big Wall Street banks and keep liquidity ample in the financial system, its policies have overwhelmingly created deflation, supporting zombie companies and blowing financial bubbles.  We are in the everything bubble.  And it's not going to take much to pop it.  What day?  I don't know.  Is it this year?  50-50.  Is it the first cup of? ",
