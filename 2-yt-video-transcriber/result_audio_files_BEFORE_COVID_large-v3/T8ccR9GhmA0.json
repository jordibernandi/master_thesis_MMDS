            "text": "Hello and welcome to my channel!  Vicerino here.  Today we're continuing on with the Evidence for Evolution series.  This time we're going to take a look at embryology.  But before we begin, just a clarification.  This series is supposed to be educational.  I will not be making reference to creationist arguments throughout this series, as it is not a response to creationism.  If you want to see me directly deal with creationist arguments, that happens on Fridays .  Part of the purpose of this series is for me to use as a reference when I am dealing with creationism, so when I say that there is evidence contained in Embryology for Evolution, rather than hunt down all the papers again, I could just point to this video.  It is also meant to be approachable to the people that do hold the creationist viewpoint.  It is somewhere they can come to see why people think evolution is true without having to tolerate a direct attack on their belief system.  I am not actively trying to change anyone's position with this series, it's just laying out the evidence that we have in a way that is hopefully easy to understand.  So let's go!  Embryology is the study of the prenatal development of an organism, and can encompass everything from the production of gametes to a fully-fledged ready-to-be-born fetus.  The evidence for evolution found in embryology is often along the same lines as the evidence found in homology, to the point that while making my homology video, I found it incredibly difficult not to use embryological examples.  as I knew that embryology would be a different topic by itself.  In fact, one of the ways we can tell if a structure is homologous is to trace its embryological development.  A truly homologous structure will originate in the same place of the embryo, while an analogous one may not.  Embryology is an interesting field because we can almost see the actual evolutionary development of an organism in the stages of the embryo.  Not a perfect reenactment of evolutionary history like Ernst Haeckel proposed with recapitulation theory, but it holds true that the more closely related two organisms are, the more similar their embryological development will be, regardless of how similar their adult forms are.  And as with homology, there is more to the similarities than a simple superficial resemblance.  So let's start off with the gill slits.  This is one of the easiest examples, as it is quite obvious just by looking at the different vertebrate embryos that they all have the same structure on the neck area.  that look remarkably like the structures that turn into the gill arches of fish.  But the similarities go deeper than just a superficial resemblance.  For instance, the structures originate from neural crest cells in the embryo.  Neural crest cells are cells that form in the embryo just after the neural tube forms.  In the embryo at this stage, there are essentially three layers of cells, the germ layers, with the top layer being the ectoderm, the middle layer being the mesoderm, and the bottom layer being the endoderm.  The neural tube is formed when the ectoderm basically folds in on itself, and the neural crest cells are the ones that are on top of this fold but just under the surface.  I tell you this because we can trace individual cell histories and see exactly which area each structure originates from in the embryo.  This is important because most bones trace their origin to the mesoderm, but the jaw bones that come from the gill slits trace their origin to the neural crest cells.  and the gill arches in jawless fish also trace their origin to the neural crest cells.  The odds of two unrelated features sharing an origin path throughout embryological development are extremely low, especially when we consider that the non-fish version turns into a structure, namely bone, that normally has its origins elsewhere.  There's also the fact that the musculature of the vertebrate jaw appears to be homologous to the musculature of the basal gills.  And then there's the upper portion of the second arch, which turns into a structure called the hyomandibular bone in jawed fish, which acts as a support for the skull.  A similar structure is found in modern reptiles, which not only helps to support the skull, but is pretty good at conducting sounds and has become part of the reptilian auditory system.  and it originates from the same place on the second arch.  The stirrup bones in the mammalian middle ear also originate from the upper portion of the second arch, but it no longer does any work in supporting the skull.  As terrestrial vertebrates spent more time out of water, their cranium became more firmly attached to the rest of the skull, and thus no longer needed the support of the hyomandibular bone.  But by the time this had happened, it had already started acting as a sound transducer, so its secondary function then became its primary function over evolutionary time, and it became the stirrup bone.
