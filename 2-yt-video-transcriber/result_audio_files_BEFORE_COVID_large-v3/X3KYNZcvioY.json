            "text": "Well, you know, I got to tell you, you know, you have, you have your forecast and then, you know, you find out, you know, through a tweet that your forecast is like, you know, has to be completely changed.  So let's take, for example, so we had a fed meeting yesterday.  Okay.  It was their December meeting.  And we learned from Jerome Powell that interest rates will probably never be raised again in my lifetime.  So Jerome Powell wants to see that 2% goal of inflation the way the Fed measures inflation.  So even though core CPI, the core consumer price index, has been above 2%, the Fed's own asinine target, for almost two years, the Fed doesn't look at CPI, which, by the way, is put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  It's not some kind of crazy investment house that puts out an inflation figure that's way above where it really is.  Then they don't look at that.  They look at something called core PCE deflator.  But that came out, and it's at 1.3% year over year.  So Jerome Powell says... that we're way below the Fed's 2% target, he is not going to raise interest rates until we get 2% plus some figure, and he has to get it there the way the core PCE deflator measures it.  It has to stay there for a very long time.  Now, I mean, I don't know how it's going to get there.  I don't know how, because, you know, the Fed can measure inflation, Fed or the government can measure inflation any way they want to.  They can take out anything they want to, and they do.  You know, they don't measure home prices.  They measure owner's equivalent rent.  They don't measure stock prices.  They don't measure asset bubbles.  They measure things that don't go up, and then they take out the things they do.  They call it trim mean.  They have all kinds of crazy ways of, I don't want to get into the weeds on this program.  So anyway, so the dollar was weakening yesterday.  And then you have Christine Lagarde, who just took over the ECB.  She had a meeting today, Thursday, on the recording of this interview.  And she turned out to be, in my opinion, a hawk.  She was much more upbeat than I thought she would be.  So she said inflation in the eurozone, its target would be 2% or a little bit below, which is exactly what Mario Draghi had.  And I thought she could possibly be someone who made 2% a floor.  But no, 2% was a hard ceiling for her.  So the dollar tank, gold was soaring this morning.  And then you get a tweet from Donald Trump.  That guess what?  We're close to a trade deal.  We had a trade deal October the 11th.  that was a wonderful soybean deal.  And, you know, Li He, who was the representative from China, said, he stood there and was like, what did we agree to exactly, Mr.  Trump?  And Trump said, you agreed to $50 billion worth of soybeans tomorrow.  And then that turned out to be, you know, just a showman.  a Carnival Parkers play that we saw in the White House.  So then we didn't have a deal.  Now we do have a deal.  And supposedly we're actually even canceling.  And this could be true.  How about if we cancel half of the tariffs that are already in place?  And in that case, we see today the dollar soaring, gold tanking, and 10-year bond yields soaring by 10 basis points.  So that part is hard.  Headline reading algorithms are sending the market all over the place.  But that's why you have to have a model that looks at longer term.  Longer term, I think growth is extremely hampered by and restricted by the $255 trillion worth of global debt.  That is putting a big cap on global growth.  We also have the fact that central bankers have gone all in and there isn't much room on the fiscal and monetary policies to do anything really at all.  So you have slow growth and you have a quality of what I think is disinflation for the most part in 2020.  So that's what I'm looking for.  And so you're just on watch now.  My model, I am on watch.  for the credit market to freeze.  When the credit market freezes, the stock market will go into free fall, and that's what we're really waiting for.  But until then, we'll just, you know, in a very hedged, carefully designed portfolio, ride this wave of euphoria up to.  however high it goes, and however high it goes, that's from where it will crash from.

            "text": "So, uh, so I have the model, the 20 point model tells me where we are as far as inflation deflation and growth and recession is concerned.  So you just rely on those, uh, cyclical and secular components to tell me how to invest.  So you cannot, you cannot invest by just reading headlines because you will destroy yourself and your clients.  That is, that is an impossibility.  Because like I said yesterday, you would have been all bullish on the gold and really bearish on the dollar and submarine.  Actually, you would have your legs taken out of you.  Today, if you were happening to be just long gold and short the stock market, you would have been destroyed today.  So the market's up over 1% as of this recording.  But listen, that could change because Trump can change.  But listen, the real issue here, Chris, is We are not, like I told you before, this is not a function, the global state of anemia, as far as global growth is concerned, is not a function of a trade war.  That is not the real reason.  The real reason is debt, demographics, and asset bubbles in the developed world, period.  That's it.  So if you can focus on the fact that the stock market in the United States has never been more expensive, in the history of records, in the entire history of the stock market, since the Buttonwood Agreement was signed until today, the stock market has never been more expensive relative to the underlying economy.  You understand that construct.  You understand that we have an earnings recession or there is no earnings growth here in the United States.  If you understand the fact that GDP growth has climbed from has descended from where it once climbed to over 4% to now under 2%.  So you have very slow economic growth, no earnings growth and record high stock prices.  You have to be cautious.  So if you can make money for your clients, still being long, but in a hedged portfolio, this way you don't have to worry about, you know, wild spikes in volatility.  You keep your sharp ratio very, very beneficial for your customers.  That's what I try to do.  And, you know, the best of my ability. ",

            "text": "And fortunately, as people can see in the backdrop at Pento Portfolio Strategies, which is pentoport.com.  And Michael, obviously you talk a lot about the gold market.  Something I've thought about is that we actually have a lot more money in debt in the system than when we reached the $1,900 high in 2011. whether the rest of the world is realizing that or not yet, probably not.  But what does it take?  I mean, the actual numbers support a much higher price, perhaps if you look at all the money that's actually out there yet still around 14, 1500 range, what does it take to get past that 90 or get close to 1900 and surpass that?

            "text": "Well, if you just look in that calculation of the, The supply of dollars divided by the ounces of gold and gold should be over $6,000 an ounce.  That's the calculation you're going to use.  That's where I think it's eventually going.  But that's not how you invest.  You don't invest for, I don't invest for someday and call that someday investing or what should be happening investing.  I don't do that.  So I want to make money basically.  as often as possible, rather than say, I'm just gonna buy some gold, load up on a ton of gold and silver, and just keep it there, and someday I might be right.  Now, let me just caution you in saying, I always think you should have some amount of precious metals in your possession.  I think between five and 10%.  That's a floor, that's the minimum, especially of gold, physical gold in your possession.  So that's your baseline.  That's where you start.  But then you go from there and say, well, when do I want to overweight gold and silver?  And when do I want to own the mining shares, which are a leveraged bet on precious metals?  So it's very simple.  For me, it's very simple.  I want to see falling real interest rates and a falling U.S.  dollar.  You had that for a little while yesterday until Trump came out with this.  tweets.  But if you can spot when this dollar, which I believe is in a topping phase, when the dollar tops out, starts to decline against the euro and the yen primarily, and you see the Federal Reserve lower interest rates back to zero, so it'll match that of the ECB and the BOJ, that's going to happen, by the way, when U.S.  growth slows significantly enough that it catches Jerome Powell's attention.  Now, you just saw today a rise in initial unemployment claims, an absolute spike above 255,000, which I think was like a seven-year high spike in claims, or seven-year or seven-month.  That makes a big difference, but I'm going off of memory here.  But it was a huge spike in the significant spike in jobless claims.  Let's just leave it at that.  That's a fact.  So we understand that that's one of that for me.  That's one of the key indicators to let me know when the U.S.  economy is going to dramatically decelerate.  Up until now, claims have been, you know, at the pace where they were in the 60s, around 200,000 initial jobless claims.  And the non-farm payroll number that we had for last month was, headline number was strong, but the year-over-year growth rate was still falling.  That's the most important number to look at, the year-over-year change in non-farm payrolls.  That's still decelerating.  So I believe the job market is in the process of deteriorating, albeit outside the, whatever, what happens with the trade war.  Once that thing gets settled, then I think we're going to be back to reality.  and a decelerating economy, a falling U.S.  dollar, falling nominal rates, falling real interest rates, and that would send, in my opinion, rocket fuel for the precious metals.  Not just my opinion.  That's what historically has happened. ",

Been waiting for a while and it's nice what you point out how they're.  there's that component where you can wait on your gold and silver, but also things that can be done in the meantime, which you help folks do.  So last question before we wrap up, I heard from your assistant yesterday that you're not as big of a silver fan.  I'm kind of going overboard on silver, but I thought it'd be great to get your opinion on that, present perhaps another side or just some things for me and my audience to think about. ",

            "text": "So I, I normally, you know, here's, here's the thing about it in tears.  So you always have some kind of precious metals in your possession, primarily gold because gold is money.  I don't consider silver money.  I consider gold money.  Um, and then you go from gold, uh, physical gold possession to the mining shares of gold.  And then if you really want the ultimate leverage for precious metals, own a silver minor.  that's you know that'll go again.  you probably know you're laughing because it's true.  so if gold and silver is in a bull market own a silver mining company and you'll you'll make a fortune in a bull market.  you'll also lose all your money uh in a down market.  so if i see in an environment where inflation is accelerating okay so the rate of change of inflation is accelerating and we have because silver is an industrial component.  if we have rising global growth especially in the emerging markets that is when you become very very wealthy owning silver mining stocks and so and and the uh metal itself ag.  okay.  so uh are we there right now?  i don't think that's the environment we have right now.  i don't think we have accelerating global inflation.  Actually, if you look very, very short term, we're in a very short cycle of inflation, which will roll over in Q1 of next year.  So up now into the next few weeks, you might see some accelerating inflation.  But when you get the year-over-year comparisons in January, February, March of last year, no.  So silver is not my favorite investment right now.  I would still head for physical gold at the moment.  But then I would change once I see nominal GDP fall in the United States.  And that is a Q1 2020 event. ",
