No.  It's your choice.  What happens if the woman was raped and is now pregnant?  Now, that's a good question.  It's still your choice.  We'll talk about it.  But the woman is raped.  It's tragic.  Why would you kill the baby?  for the crime of the father?  The baby's innocent.  How do you raise a child that has been brought to this earth?  You have it adopted, and you don't kill it.  Then she has to carry the baby in her body.  I still have to carry the baby for nine months and remember this tragedy.  Oh, which is worse, carry the baby or kill it?  It's wrong to kill.  How do you?  Who told you that?  It's written on your conscience.  You don't kill babies, ever.  There's the one that says you shall not kill.  There's the one that gave you the conscience.  But he also says you shall not judge, and any sinner will be forgiven.  Where does it say that?  Where does the Bible say thou shall not judge?  It doesn't say that.  Yes, it does. ",

And when I see a woman kill a child, I can say that's morally wrong.  It's a moral judgment.  You've got the right to make that judgment.  So have I. And our courts say it's okay to kill babies in the womb at the moment.  And I want to see that overturned.  It's hearts beating at three weeks, one day.  It sucks its thumb.  You know how they do abortions?  They crush the head, rip the arms and legs off.  That's how abortions are done.  You're right.  So have you changed your mind?  No.  So would you vote pro-life?

So Letitia, I'm not judging you, but by your own admission you're a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and you have to face God on Judgment Day.  If He judges you by the Ten Commandments but looked at four of them, would he be innocent or guilty?  Innocent.  Why?  because I have asked for forgiveness.  It won't help you.
