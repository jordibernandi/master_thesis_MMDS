You're literally programmed to avoid dying.  That isn't to say there are exceptions to that rule, but as a baseline, we try to avoid death.

We don't understand everything there is to know about why humans age in the way they do, but there are some ideas that have been floating around, such as the fact that telomeres get smaller every single time that you create new cells, till eventually there's not a lot of data for your cells to reproduce from, and thus they start creating faulty cells.  If we could find a way to extend or prolong the life of telomeres, or even replace them within our own body, then it's reasonable to think that this is something that could potentially halt the aging process, or at the very least, slow it down.  But even that may end up leading to more issues later on down the road.  We don't know.  People don't do this so that they can avoid an afterlife.  The only people who are scared of an afterlife are people who've been told by people like you that they're going to burn in hell forever.

So in Cole's original video, he actually included a clip that I really didn't feel like playing from a futurologist talking about the Egyptians' beliefs.  If you really desperately want to see that clip as well, then by all means, a link will be in the description.  Anywho, the Egyptians didn't fear death, not any more so than any other human being.  They had pyramids set up so that when they died, they would have their treasures transferred into the afterlife.  They very much believed in an afterlife just like you.  They just believed it was a different one than you have.  The idea that they didn't want to burn in hell wasn't something in their belief structure in the same way it is in the Christian one.  You see, in the Egyptian mythos, Anubis would weigh your soul against a feather.  And if your soul weighed less than that feather, so you didn't have as many crimes burdened on your soul, then you got to go into an afterlife.  At least a more pleasant one than would be had in store for you otherwise.  This is somewhat similar to the Christian version of heaven and hell, but it is still different.  So the idea that Egyptian kings wanted to be buried with their treasures so that they could live forever is a preposterous one.  Egyptians knew death was coming.  There was no way to really avoid it.  But they, not unlike Christians, had a set of beliefs that included the afterlife.  They weren't worried about burning in your hell.  Your hell wasn't part of their beliefs.  And besides, there really is no difference between wanting to avoid burning so you get saved and wanting to avoid burning so you want to be immortal.  In both situations, you're avoiding being burned. ",

So I am including this clip from Call to an Uprising's video, specifically because there's an issue that I want to address in here, and it's that of mind uploading.  As fantastical of an idea as it is, if you've ever worked with data, you can already see some of the problems that come up with it.  Where Data's concerned, when you are downloading something, which is the terminology that they used, you are creating a copy of it.  This means that you, as an individual, if you died, a copy of your brain would be somewhere.  But that doesn't mean that you would still be alive.  It's like if a version of you existed in a parallel dimension.  Or, even more accurately, if a clone of you existed that had every single life experience you did and made every single decision you did up until the point where you died.  That clone is still a different person.  They're not you.  Just as having two leaves that are genetic copies of one another doesn't make them the same leaf, they are still different leaves.  Uploading something onto the internet doesn't transfer it from one area to another.  It simply gives instructions to rewrite the data elsewhere.  For instance, if I upload a video to YouTube, the original still exists on my hard drive.  The uploaded version of the brain would be no different than the YouTube video you're watching right now, whereas the original it was uploaded from is no different than the original sitting on my hard drive.  It makes no difference to you if I delete the original on my hard drive, because you still get to see the copy on YouTube.  However, in this instance, the original is still destroyed.  Meaning that even if you were to do mind uploading in the way they're describing here, from what I can tell, you as an individual, you as a person, would still be dead.  The only way that you would be able to make this work is by moving the hardware as well.  You would have to move the physical brain that houses all of these things.  Any type of uploading would simply be creating a copy of it.  In which case, if your efforts are that of self-preservation, then all of these endeavors are a moot point. ",

Like, seriously, if you don't think there's something wrong with attempting to avoid death, then insert dark joke here.  that would get me immediately demonetized.  But the point is, you've said that these celebrities are attempting to avoid judgment, and yet you're saying that it will happen whether they believe it or not.  But if they don't believe in your god, then they wouldn't be believing that they're trying to avoid any particular type of judgment, now would they?  Your claim is that they're attempting to avoid the eternal hellfire that will come for them when the judgment comes, and that judgment comes when they are, you know, dead.  And yet here you claim that it will happen whether they believe it or not, meaning that you understand that there are some of them who don't believe this.  So if somebody doesn't believe in your god, and thus doesn't believe in your hell, how are they possibly attempting to avoid your hell, a hell that they don't believe in? ",

But in all seriousness, we don't really get to choose our beliefs, so if we can't choose our beliefs, and don't believe in your god, then it would appear to me that this isn't an active choice for anyone.  I can't choose to be a Christian right now.  I can go through the motions, but I can't make myself believe in your God.  Nor, logically, can anyone else. ",

Have you ever considered that in this way, God is just an abusive father?  And the only real argument I've ever heard in this situation is that, well, he's got enough power to do that, so it's his right.  Which is an argument that if you extend it to its logical extreme, means that might makes right in all scenarios.  Which means that if somebody is stronger than you and they punch you in the face, it was within their right to do it because they're more powerful than you.  If somebody comes into your house and kills everyone in their house, well, they were more powerful than the people in that house.  It was well within their rights to do so because they had the power at the time.  Except any sane person wouldn't make this might makes right argument.  So in order to make this argument specifically for God, you have to engage in special pleading.  Which is a wonderful fallacy that you really shouldn't be falling into.  It sounds more like you're afraid that you personally don't have a lot of power to do anything in this world, and so you hide behind God because he gives you the idea that you are at least on the side of something that can have the power to change the world.  Or, more accurately, prevent it from changing.  Because every video I've seen on your channel, Carl, seems to basically be saying that the world is changing around you and that terrifies you.  It scares you.  It gets under your skin.  Social progress is your kryptonite.  And so you have to threaten 400,000 people and more, your subscribers and your viewers, into believing exactly as you do, otherwise, the gates of hell open and it's time for God's barbecue. ",
