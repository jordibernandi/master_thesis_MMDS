            "text": "By the end of 2017, global quantitative easing was running at a $2.12 trillion annual run rate.  It was as if we were bailing out AIG every single month.  And then some.  The New York Fed, this is something that seems to be ominous to some people out there, have been stepping in recently to help money markets, putting billions of dollars in overnight for folks, banks and others who are caught short on cash.  Danielle, is this a big problem?  Well, I think it's a big problem if the Fed can't get its arms around what's happening right now.  There's a supply-demand imbalance.  They came out.  They did another operation this morning.  These are theoretically emergency measures that they're taking.  But you can't take an emergency measure every day.  Let me get some breaking news here.  Steve Leisman's got this.  Steve.  Carl, thanks very much.  John Williams, New York Fed president, speaking about recent action in the repo market.  The overnight market says that moves in the funding market were, quote, outside of recent experience.  Kind of another way of the Fed president saying that they were a little surprised by what happens.  They were.  prepared to supply liquidity.  And we happen to know from our own reporting that they were indeed in a state of heightened monitoring of the markets on that Friday.  The trouble, they said, was that markets were not distributing liquidity effectively.  Translation, there was enough stuff around.  It just wasn't getting to where it needed to go in the right way.  So the Fed came in and they say there, he says the repo operations did reduce the market strains.  We're not out of the woods yet, William says.  There are potential strains in the funding market coming at the end of the quarter.  That's why the Fed this week will do three two-week operations that will tide over the market over the quarter end.  What basically this is all about is getting funding to operate day to day.  So this is all overnight.  It's very temporary, it's very quick, and it's fairly simple if you think about it.  Basically, the Bank of Julie in this case has a number of treasuries, and this could be other securities as well, not just treasuries, that needs financing, needs to get backed by cash.  Now, she can hold those on her sheet, but at some point, she's going to need the cash to hold that in her balance sheet.  Now, Adam has a lot of cash that he can offer, so he can sell the cash to Julie overnight for a fee.  So he's going to charge an interest rate on that.  But in exchange, as collateral, Julie will offer treasuries.  This is why this is called a repurchase agreement, which is the long name for a repo, because she's selling the treasuries, the securities to Adam, and then repurchasing it for cash later on.  Are we about to see the US financial markets go crazy?  That is what Goldman Sachs seems to think, and it certainly wouldn't be the first time that great financial chaos has been unleashed during the month of October.  When the stock market crashed in October 1929, it started the worst economic depression that we have ever witnessed.  In October 1987, the largest single-day percentage decline in US stock market history rocked the entire planet, and the nightmarish events of October 2008 set the stage for a great recession that we still haven't fully recovered from.  So, could it be possible that something similar may happen in October 2019?  According to CNBC, Goldman Sachs is warning that the stock market could soon go crazy again.  For investors taking a breather from the chaos in August, buckle up as the market is about to go crazy again, Goldman Sachs warned.  is 10 years out on the financial crisis, we still don't have the infrastructure perhaps to prevent the next one.  And I think this is where digital assets can really help because an efficient digital asset can really solve some of the key problems in global liquidity.  you know, the world's got trillions and trillions of dollars tied up in liquidity just to get around how clunky the movement of value is around the world.  If with a really efficient digital asset, something like XRP, and that's what we believe will be the most efficient, you can now reduce trillions and trillions of capital from being tied up.  So you can make those transfers instantly as a bank or as a payment provider, as an enterprise, without having to have money pre-positioned all over the world.  We think about using digital assets as a great opportunity to solve the significant problem of trapped capital and pre-funding in the traditional correspondent banking system, which is extremely inefficient with the setup of Nostro and Bostro accounts.  And we estimate that up to $10 trillion of trapped capital are being used very inefficiently as a result of this legacy system that we're currently moving money with.  XRP is a decentralized open source asset that was specifically built for the payments use case.  And so it has real utility and value, and that is a key differentiator of our digital asset versus other cryptocurrencies.  In this bifurcated world, what is the option to replace the supremacy of the US dollar?  That's the first question.  Do you see IMF holding crypto assets in the future?  I did not put that up there.  Remember, I'm from the legal department.  I'm supposed to be very conservative about these things.  In this bifurcated world, what is the option to replace the supremacy of the US dollar?  That's the first question.  With a stable coin?  Okay.  Is that an alternative?  It's kind of hard for me to imagine that we're anywhere near the replacement of the U.S.  dollar as the reserve currency.  You know, I do think the... The issue of digital currency is a real issue.  And so rather than thinking that there's another existing currency that may replace the dollar, I think one real issue that regulators and the world is going to have to get its head around is this notion of digital currency to facilitate international payments in particular and reduce the friction and the cost of that internationalization of commerce.  And that, I think, is a bigger issue.  I still think the dollar will be the reserve currency for quite some time.  Mark Carney hopes Sarah is sitting down because he is calling for the creation of a new virtual currency that could ease the reliance of the world on the U.S.  dollar, which he says creates some of the problems that we have today.  This new economy requires a new finance, a new finance to serve the digital economy.  a new finance that balances innovation with resilience.  And that new finance requires a new Bank of England, one which will enable innovation and empower competition, all while ensuring the resilience of the financial system.  So let me take a few moments to expand.  First, to enable the digital economy, the very nature of commerce is changing.  Last year, one fifth of all sales in the UK were online.  Next year, it'll be one quarter.  Use of cash has declined from two thirds of all payments a decade ago to only one quarter today.  This new economy is placing new demands on the financial system.  Consumers and businesses increasingly expect transactions to be settled in real time and payments across borders to be indistinguishable from those across the street.  And to help private innovation meet these demands, the bank is leveling the playing field between old and new.  At the fresh shape coming out of the White House.  Over the years, the United States has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars with the European Union, and we just want it to be a level playing field.  Because Ripple always was different from Bitcoin in that you could put anything of value in it, right?  So this idea of kind of, we would call it IOUs or balances, but really being value agnostic and that then being the engine for the exchange of that thing of value.  But having the combination of ILP with XRP, we think that's kind of the killer formula.  So now you can have any type of value, like any currency, but also any type of ledger.  So like anything from a centralized ledger to a blockchain, et cetera.  And if we look at kind of stepping way back, kind of the macro problem that we think the world has is lack of an internet of value.  You kind of argue that this gets to the heart of the problem with globalization, which is obviously under a lot of stress today, right?  It's kind of not working for a lot of people.  Threat against trade at the moment is the biggest hurdle for the global economy.  Yes, indeed.  And we don't think of it as like, well, globalization's bad.  We think of it, globalization's actually incomplete.  Until you have an internet of value, you really can't have true globalization.  You sort of need these three core interoperability technologies working all together.  You need interoperability of data, of goods, and money, right?  And then we think really good things happen when the world finally has a full kind of globalization platform.  But this has to happen.  And again, what is this meaning now that we don't have it right now?  It means, you know, we all know sending 50 bucks to Europe is kind of impossible, right?  We know the example of the Airbnb host in Tanzania who should be making 29 bucks on a rental, and by the end of the day, nine bucks is showing up as an actual example, right?  Yes, yes.  And I mean, true to, you know, the very beginnings of the company, we've always really understood that for these innovations with blockchain and digital assets to really take hold around the world, it needs to operate within a global regulatory framework.  So just to start us off, and I mean, that's kind of a really big thing to take on.  So just to start us off, kind of tell us about the landscape.  What is the regulatory climate around the world?  you know, we're actively engaged in with 50 governments around the world.  And I think that the regulators are hearing us.  And I think that they've been extraordinarily receptive.  I think, you know, from a U.S.  standpoint, the  U.S.,  I think, is trying to provide some more clarity, which I think is a very positive development.  Because at the end of the day, there's a significant risk there that we'll lose.  we'll lose business overseas, and what does that mean?  It means we lose innovation, we lose tax revenues, and we lose jobs, and that's not a good outcome.  So there is a significant risk there if we don't get it right.  The way at Ripple we view cross-border payments as sort of the most practical use case for digital assets.  More recently, we've seen global consensus from countries across the world, including the UK, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, noting that XRP is not a security, but in fact a hybrid between a utility and settlement token.  And again, I just reiterate that we do not see crypto as replacing fiat.  We see opportunities for the two to coexist, and we see significant benefits from building network of networks.  And the UK also says we're going to continue to evolve the guidance as the industry and the innovation evolves along with it.  And what the UK said was that we're going to put these tokens into three buckets, a security token, a utility token, and an exchange token.  And if you're a security token, again, If I sell you a token and I give you a right title or interest to my company, you're going to be treated and supervised and regulated as a security.  If not, you're going to be treated as a utility token or an exchange token or in some cases a hybrid of both.  XRP was put in the bucket of being a hybrid utility and exchange token.  The IMF has been very supportive of central bank action that we've seen from the crisis coming out of the crisis and now this new period of easing.  I wonder if you worry at all, though, that central banks are running low on bullets.  Central banks have been able to invent new tools when nobody suspected that they would.  You know, whether you look at quantitative easing in its different incarnations, whether you look at forward guidance, whether you look at macro prudential measures, it's incredible how much has been designed, invented and created.  Call it the past decade.  We took one step beyond, one step further into the abyss of this grand experiment by keeping money lower for longer, and engaging in quantitative easing.  There's a name for it.  It was designed in 2007.  It's called the Bernanke Doctrine.  Bernanke took a few people into a quiet room in Jackson Hole, a few of his closest advisors, which is questionable on an ethical level itself, and they laid out the fact that the Fed would have to get to the zero bound first.  That was a critical step one before it could then launch into quantitative easing.  So our view on digital assets is we feel that there's a role to connect different fiat currencies, particularly more exotic currencies where that bilateral relationship does not exist.  And in our case, we use XRP as the bridge currency.  How do we do that?  We do that through the second part of RippleNet, which is on-demand liquidity, or xRapid, where instead of pre-funding overseas, we source for liquidity from digital asset exchanges in both the home and the beneficiary market.  Very simply, obviously there's much more complexity to it, it's XRapid.  is two domestic payments connected by a movement of xrp.  so in this instance it will be usd to xrp at the home exchange a movement of xrp across the ledger to the beneficiary exchange and xrp to mexican peso.  the final payout could be over local rails a direct relationship into digital wallets.  on top of that there's a messaging and settlement layer which includes the ripple payment object which includes all the information you would get in a cross-border payment, KYC for instance, settlement finality, any other legal issues you may have.  Either side of this is a financial institution in our model.  We're looking to connect fiat currencies, so they will conduct the KYC and all the checks that you would do in a normal cross-border payment.  and we're not looking to circumvent the system.  It's live today, we've had two quarters and we've seen significant cost reductions.  Let me conclude.  The new finance has the potential to unlock stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive growth.  And by taking some of the measures like those that I've outlined today, the Bank of England can help enable that new economy, empower greater competition and ensure the resilience of the financial system at the same time.  After all, we all remember that finance is not an end to itself.  Finance is a servant of households and entrepreneurs that make this country great.  And they are demanding more sustainable and inclusive and a more prosperous future.  The ultimate test of new finance is whether we can design it and put it into place in a way that helps deliver just that. ",
