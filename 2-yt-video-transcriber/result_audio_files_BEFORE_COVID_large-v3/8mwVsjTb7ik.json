            "text": "No, no, no.  What I want to say is this.  What Trump did is he disturbed this hegemonic peace.  Till Trump, Republican, Democratic Party, there were tensions and so on.  Of course, Democrats were not the same as Dick Cheney and so on.  But basically there was some understanding, you know.  They shared the same field, and that's always how politics works.  It's not only just explicit rules.  It's these customs, unspoken rules, how you do things.  And Trump disturbed this piece.  You have now here some kind of a... ideological civil war.  And why should the left use this opportunity?  Now, I don't know if you read my last piece, published just digitally on this, where I go, and some people again accuse me, you defend Trump.  No, I'm not.  No, sorry, just very briefly.  You know, Even this now impeachment process against Trump, I'm skeptical about it.  Not only, you know, Trump's talked a lot, but he didn't attack North Korea, he didn't attack Iran or Syria.  He's much more cautious here.  This is why many right-wing hardliners are beginning to doubt him.  But I want to tell you another thing here.  For me, this is a clear example of how ideology works.  It's easy to attack Trump Because he's obviously, personally, if not corrupted, then immoral, opportunistic, whatever guy.  But it would be much more interesting, and the lesson of the guys whom I admire, the triad, Assange, Snowden, Chelsea Manning, is... to focus on, let's call it naively, evil, violation of human rights, blah, blah, which are part of the anonymous functioning of the state apparatus.  You don't need an evil guy like Trump to see what NSA is doing in combination with Facebook, with Google, and so on, and so on.  That's why now in a text that appeared only digitally, I said I contrasted Trump with his great enemy, who probably personally is... More or less, although I doubt, honest, James Comey in higher loyalty.  I'm much more afraid of people who do the same stuff, the same, violating of human rights, blah, blah, just on behalf of have some higher loyalty.  We should never forget that the problem today, digital control, oppression and so on, it's not the problem of single corrupted individuals.  I'm much more afraid of people who are sincere fanatics and think they are doing the patriotic duty and so on and so on.  That's the problem I have with impeaching Trump.  Of course, he should be not impeached.  He should be arrested.  Kill him.  I don't care.  What I'm just saying is, my fear is this one.  I'm suspicious about this, I call it, John Oliver, John Stewart, leftist reaction, even Alec Baldwin, let's make endlessly fun of Trump.  Yes, you did this, and at the end he will be re-elected, and so on and so on.  I mean, but maybe I'm wrong here.  My old dogma about Trump, Okay, back to Bernie Sanders.  Bernie Sanders was the only hope.  Why?  Believe me or not, I have some connections there.  Bernie Sanders is from Burlington.  Burlington is the only department where my colleagues of cinema studies, Lacanian psychoanalysts, are in power.  So I met some people around Bernie.  Why do I confuse the two of them?  It's very suspicious.  And they told me this.  We have the squad.  And Trump tried to focus his criticism on the squad.  Alexandria, Octavio Cortez, and so on.  But the strength of Democratic Party would be to bring the squad together with Bernie Sanders, who stands for old white men.  Sanders voters, I was told, in Vermont, are people who otherwise would have voted for Trump, maybe even.  These ordinary impoverished farmers and so on and so on.  This combination we should strive at.  This was the greatness of Sanders.  He mobilized for the left cause all this.  old-fashioned, even moral majority guys, and so on and so on.  So this is for me the only, and this is why I think, I cannot prove it statistically, but this is why Hillary lost.  People, I had many connections, I met people, my son even volunteered to, my son, who is from Slovenia, he was 18 years, he contacted, because he was with his mother in Ithaca, Cornell, And if Bernie Sanders were to be presidential candidate, the whole summer he was already in contact with Democratic Party Committee in Ithaca, Cornell.  He offered to walk door by door, work for Sanders.  Offered to commit election interference. ",

No.  The key factor was so many thousands, hundreds of thousands of Bernie Sanders partisans were disgusted at how Hillary manipulated him.

You know, first they hailed Hitler's arrival to power.  Fine, we have now pure confrontation, we know.  First, I nonetheless think that, and I admit it, First, I don't universalize this.  United States are a rich enough country, rich not in the sense of material, rich in the sense of the rich, complex texture of civil society and so on.  So whatever Trump is, it's not simply a new fascist dictatorship.  While for Europe, I worry much more.  I would never have been for Boris Johnson in England.  That's a much more serious threat.  I would never have been for Marine Le Pen.  But for me, I admit it, many real things were lost, like health care and so on.  But maybe I'm here a little bit too much of an idealist, Leninist leftist.  What I saw in Trump is just someone who can trigger a revival of a slightly more radical left.  It's not really radical.  I found this ridiculous.  Bernie Sanders, Venezuela, look at his program.  It's much less radical than every European social democracy half a century ago.  That's our reality now.  If today you repeat what European social democracy said half a century ago, you are Venezuela, communist, whatever, and so on and so on.  So what I'm saying is that it's a very brutal, cynical calculus.  I still think it was worth the price.  if we will get an authentic... left and I agree with you we need this broad coalition.  but you know like there are no pure compromises always always somebody wins and the left has now a unique chance to demand More.

Like all of a sudden, before you had Republicans, Democrats, which were more or less, not quite, but more or less like, you know, like Coke or Pepsi or whatever.  This standard opposition really didn't mean anything.  Now you finally get something that resembles Trump.  A true political struggle here.  I think this is very precious.  Sorry, another thing.  You know where the left should answer.  Now, of course, many mainstream liberal economists say the left just wants to spend money and so on and so on.  And the idea is this doesn't work, only brings bankruptcy.  This is so stupidly wrong.  I talked with many economists who said, let's look at World War II.  You know that the United States were not really out of crisis before World War II.  What World War II meant is tremendous amounts of money spent in a non-productive way, arms and so on.  At the end of World War II, you know that if you take away all the military production and take just private consumerist stuff, United States produced more than ever private consumer.  In other words, if we can learn anything from history, it's that if you do it intelligently, Just print money, spend it, invest, state it.  They work.  They work.  And now I will give you another reason for this.  Everybody knows this, that Reagan was doing this.  Trump is now doing this.  Trump is the wild Keynesian.  Trump's politics, economic, insofar as it works, it's absolutely not this neoliberalist austerity.  It is austerity against the poor.  But he prints and spends money like crazy.  You're... Do you remember when Clinton was in power, the right wing was worried, oh, Democrats just print money.  Now Trump is doing this to an extent unimaginable before.  The left should learn this lesson and be less afraid of spending money.  Trillion is just a trillion.  If you do it intelligently, you can do it. ",
