            "text": "Hi brothers and sisters, it's Pastor Tim.  Well, it has been a busy day and I have, I'm not going to lug them over here, I have over there boxes that are full for Crisis Pregnancy Center.  So first of all, I want to say thank you to the channel family, the support, the ministries.  You are a blessing and we, Monday, they are going to be going to to two different crisis pregnancy centers.  We have other ministries that we support.  People are, are getting saved from these efforts and needs are being provided for.  So thank you all.  You're a part of that.  I want to talk about what the image on this thumbnail and this false God, Molech that goes back to the Canaanite people and the, um, Phoenicians, they would sacrifice their children in the fire to the false god Molech.  I believe it's Leviticus 18.21 where the Lord says, do not sacrifice your children in the fire.  God has specifically said not to.  Of course he has.  Well, of all things, the Colosseum.  is owned and run by the Vatican.  If you know history, you know that many Christians were tortured and killed in the Colosseum.  It's a high traffic tourist destination.  Well, just here in October, you have a replica of the false god, Molech, that is at the entrance And they have other things that they're displaying of ancient peoples.  Now, this was approved by the Pope himself.  This goes all the way to the top.  Approved by the Vatican, by the Pope.  Not surprised.  These are the days we're living in, brothers and sisters.  Literally, people who are visiting... and want to go visit the Colosseum are going by in the entrance this false god, a replica of this false god.  Not only that, but it was within the past week or so that the Pope, there were actually photo shoots of the Pope giving a blessing over an African false goddess, Why is anybody surprised by this?  I believe this Pope, Pope Francis, is the false prophet of Revelation.  I absolutely believe that.  Can't prove it, but I believe it.  He has been working for this one world religion.  The same Pope has said that Jesus was a failure at the cross, that he sinned.  He's gone against the word of God.  The spirit of Antichrist is alive.  Listen, I reported in the past month or so that they have this on Sedot Island near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.  They have a facility.  What are they called?  The Abrahamic House where... Within this facility, you'll have the three Abrahamic faiths.  You'll have Christianity, meaning Catholicism in this case.  You'll have Islam, and you'll have the Jewish people.  We are seeing the one world government and the one world religion be informed before our very eyes.  Do you remember, for those in the United States, the Brett Kavanaugh hearings?  At that time, and when the UN has had significant meetings, they have had a replica of the Arch of Baal where children would be sacrificed in the fire to the false god Baal.  It's the same thing.  It's wickedness.  It's satanic.  This is what it is.  And while the hearings were going on and people were railing with just lies, and boy, it's continued.  I can tell you it's continued.  Lies.  They just make up lies.  Anything to discredit a person.  It was never about the character of Brett Kavanaugh.  It was the spirit of Antichrist and wanting to murder more babies.  And they did not want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.  And I don't care if it offends anybody.  Abortion should be illegal.  Illegal.  100% illegal.  It is the murder of the unborn.  And their blood cries out.  I'll tell you what.  When I pray, and yes, is there forgiveness for those who are post-abortive?  Absolutely.  God loves them as much as he loves me and you and Jesus.  God loves them fiercely and passionately, and he would that all would be saved.  And we want to boldly proclaim the gospel of grace.  In fact, the ABCs of salvation is in the description box.  If you are post-abortive and think you're unworthy.  of of his love that is a lie.  he loves you.  admit you're a sinner in need of a savior and believe on the son of god god.  the son always existed.  left glory laid down.  his glory was born of a virgin wrapped in flesh lived a perfect life and shed his precious blood on the cross of calvary to pay the debt for your sins once and for all past present and future.  all sufficient hallelujah.  he loves you believe on him.  Romans 10, 9 and 10 says, if we confess the Lord Jesus with our mouth and believe in our heart that God raised him from the dead, we will be saved.  For it is with a heart that man believes, with a heart man believes and is justified.  And with a mouth confession is made into salvation.  Ephesians 2, 8, 9, for by grace, justice is getting what we deserve.  Mercy is not getting what we deserve.  Grace is getting what we don't deserve.  Jesus paid the debt for our sins.  As 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4 says, Christ died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  Back to Ephesians 2, 8, 9.  For by grace, his unmerited favor.  It's all based off of what Jesus did.  For by grace are we saved through faith.  We appropriate that grace through faith.  For by grace are we saved through faith.  For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of ourselves.  It is the gift of God, not by works, lest anyone should boast.  We are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.  Praise God.  Well, brothers and sisters, this is just another sign that we are truly in the final moments of the end of days.  They're not hiding it now.  They're not hiding any of this.  As I pray for the, for the, holocaust against the unborn around the world it's not much longer brothers and sisters it's not much longer.  well there you have it.  yep the pope has been blessing these false gods and now he's approved for this replica of the god this hideous, heinous.  Look up Leviticus 18.21.  I believe it's 18.21.  I know it's in chapter 18.  Look it up.  In fact, like the god Chemish that the Moabites sacrificed their children in.  I mean, you know, the Moabites, think about it, that's a culture that was founded when Lot and his daughters escaped Sodom and Gomorrah, went into the foothills or the mountains.  I can only imagine that these girls thought, because what they saw was was all destroyed, and they said, we're going to sleep with our father and propagate, right, have children.  That's incest.  Well, Moab was one of the children born.  It was a culture founded with the foundation of incest.  Well, these people in Moab, they would sacrifice their children to this false god Chemish in the belly of the fire, just like Molech.  And God said, whoa, the word says, I believe it's in Psalms.  Whoa, it may be Proverbs.  I can't recall, but whoa?  to the inhabitants of Moab.  Do you know that beautiful story, Naomi?  And Elimelech and their two sons, Malon and Kilion, there was a famine in Jerusalem.  They left.  They went to the land of Moab.  There their sons married daughters.  One married Ruth.  One married Orpah.  Well, lo and behold, Elimelech, Naomi's husband, dies.  And then her two sons, Malon and Kilion, die.  She's left with these daughters, these daughters-in-law, and Elimelech.  They have nothing.  The famine ends in Jerusalem.  She says, we're going back.  As they're going, she said, call me Mara, for my name is now bitter, right?  The Lord has, right, this has happened to me.  She tells her daughters-in-law, go back to your people.  I have no more sons for you to marry.  There wasn't a welfare system like we have in many nations now.  They would glean fields at the harvest time, and that could actually be dangerous for a younger woman for anyone.  But anyway, Orpah goes back and Ruth says that beautiful passage in the book of Ruth.  No, your God will be my God and your people will be my people.  Wherever you go, I will go.  And oh, the whole story.  Read it, read it.  I don't have time to preach it right now.  The whole story of Boaz, the kinsman, redeemer, glory to God, brothers and sisters.  Oh, there's so much in that, a foreshadowing of what's to come.  We're going to be raptured soon.  The bridegroom is coming.  But they were this society, this culture.  God said, woe to you inhabitants.  What's going to hit the planet?  Hmm.  I'm thankful for the blood of Jesus that paid the debt for my sins once and for all.  I'm thankful that I'm not saved by works nor kept saved by works, that the works it talks about in Ephesians 2, verse 10, for we are created in his workmanship unto good works, which he preplanned or preordained beforehand.  It is abiding in Christ.  We are in him.  The nanosecond we believe we are saved and sealed until the day of redemption.  I can take no credit or glory for anything good that comes as I abide in Christ and Holy Spirit does.  those works through us.  Praise God.  All the glory to God.  Hallelujah.  I've said this before.  No one has sinned.  focusing on sin hasn't stopped anyone from sinning.  Know who you are in Christ.  We are born again.  We are a new creation in Christ Jesus.  We are seated in him, in him, in the heavenlies.  We're in Christ.  Hallelujah.  Oh, if we could see ourselves the way he sees us.  Well, anyway, I wanted to bring you the news about this.  What's going on at?  some of you may say oh so what.  i think these things are really significant and and i know that um wow we are living in the final moments of the end of days.  we don't know the day nor hour but i'll tell you what the bridegroom is coming soon until he does if it's a day if it's a year if it's two years whatever it is.  um i believe it's like anybody feel like time is just speeding up whenever it happens.  1 Thessalonians 4, 16 to 18.  The Lord himself shall descend with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God.  The dead in Christ will rise first.  And then those of us who are alive and remain will be caught up together with him in the air.  And we will be with the Lord forever.  Oh, what he has awaiting us.  Until then, here's the heart of God.  That all would be saved.  We know they won't.  God loves everyone.  And we must occupy and redeem the time.  Boldly share the gospel of grace.  Do not be ashamed of the gospel of grace.  Oh, brothers and sisters, we're living in the most sobering yet exciting time in church history.  We are at the end of a dispensation, and we have the privilege of boldly sharing the gospel of grace.  We are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.  Faith plus nothing.  Equal salvation and eternal security.  Well, I want to bless you.  I've been busy all day.  I was up actually very early.  Normally I get up about four for my prayer time.  I was up at one o'clock praying and it was, oh, it was so awesome.  Just that time alone in the presence of the Lord and then in the word.  May the Lord bless you and keep you.  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.  May his countenance be lifted on you and his shalom, his peace, perfect, whole, complete, nothing lacking, nothing missing, be yours in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, in the name of Jesus Messiah.  I pray and I bless you.  Remember, he loves you fiercely and passionately.  I love you too.  Shalom. ",
