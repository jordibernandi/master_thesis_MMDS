            "text": "Hello.  I wanted to share with you something that I did recently that actually was pretty cool.  It was one of those things where, you know, the older I get and the more I understand who I am and the more I like who I am, the more I want to kind of like fix things or, make things right from the past.  And so great example of this has to do with a high school reunion that is attempting to be organized.  Regardless if I go to the reunion or not, this has to do with the Facebook group that was created for it.  So I went to an army high school, Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  I graduated in 1992 and it's really hard to organize reunions because people who are as some of you probably know, like if you're an army brat or a military brat, it's hard to keep track of everybody after they leave.  But Facebook makes it kind of easy to be able to try to find everyone.  So this reunion would be for those who graduated from the late eighties through the nineties.  But this group, you know, people are starting to reconnect and share what they've been up to.  And there's a lot of, as I'm sure you can imagine, pictures from then and then here's me now kind of stuff going on.  Um, I thought about it for a little bit if I wanted to do that or not, because, you know, doing something like that in my situation is basically like a way of coming out.  Um, I wanted to make it clear that like, this is who I thought it was back then, but guess what?  It turns out this is who I am.  Um, so I'm going to show you the picture that I posted.  So on the left is me in high school.  on the right is a picture of me just from a couple months ago and I purposely chose this shirt that I wore because I feel like it really conveys the fact that at the very least I'm somewhere underneath the queer umbrella and so I posted it and I was nervous because really like I was coming out I'm coming out to people I went to high school with.  some of them are people.  maybe I didn't even know or I didn't even know if they remembered me but I. So I'm coming out to some people who were my friends, some people who were strangers, but it's this big coming out and I'm happy to report that it went good.  People liked it and loved it.  There was like a lot of comments on it.  People were just like, Hey, it's great to see you again.  Um, you look great.  Like I love your shirt.  People were being very conversational.  I didn't even know or remember a lot of the people who were commenting on it, which was very interesting.  And it just felt really good.  It felt like something that my younger self, like you kind of wish.  you could go back in time and tell your younger self, like, guess what?  I know, like you don't even know.  You don't know stuff about yourself when it comes to your sexuality, when it comes to your gender identities.  There's all this stuff you're going to learn as you get older.  And guess what?  You're going to tell these high schoolers about it and people are going to be cool.  In fact, some people are going to be like supportive and celebrating this about you.  It's good psychologically to reconcile things with your younger self.  And I've been working really hard on that in the last couple of years of doing things that I think my younger self needed me to do, needed me to tell them, like to help heal that relationship.  So even though I'm going like this and I'm gesturing towards a person in the past, that person is inside of me.  That younger version of Dara has been with me all along.  And so you really do some healing work.  when in this case, um, putting something out there about yourself that maybe in the past would have been shameful and it would have been scary, but it turns out it goes good.  Um, it just one more, one more time to take a deep breath and say, Ooh, Like, all right, this is really worth it for me to have discovered who I am and to share it with the world.  So I just wanted to share that with you because, I don't know, it was pretty cool.  And I wonder if that could give you ideas about things either that you could be doing, depending on where you're at in your journey, or if there's things you could be doing for, like I said, your younger self that's inside that still needs some healing and repairing and that kind of stuff.  So if you have anything about that that you want to share, the comments.  I would love to see them and thanks again. ",
