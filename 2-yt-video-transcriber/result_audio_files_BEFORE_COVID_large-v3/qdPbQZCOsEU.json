            "text": "No one could deny that we are in fact living in interesting times to make use of the so-called Chinese expression.  I believe it's attributed to some ancient Chinese saying.  Because at this point in time, the nature of our interaction is such that really only the extremes appear to have benefit, at least ostensibly.  And by that I mean the extremes of one end and the extremes of another.  not necessarily on the same scale or continuum.  Specifically, I'm talking about the contrast between the Chad and what I might qualify or classify as the archmage.  Now, you might know from fantasy the concept of an archmage, a highly accomplished wizard or sorcerer who's mastered the most difficult arcane secrets and arts and is respected and looked up to, and he can do a whole lot with his magic that a mageling could not.  or your typical adventuring wizard.  And I'm using Archmage here as a proxy for the really, really smart people in society, the elites, the Elon Musks, the Peter Thiels, the people doing things that we can only dream of because of their immense cognitive endowment.  And for them, things are going quite well.  And I've talked about this many times by now, the cognitive divide,  etc.,  etc.  These guys are having a decent time, and I don't think they're going to stop having a decent time.  They have access to things due to their cognitive gifts that other people simply don't.  And that will continue.  That will be a trend that will continue in the future.  But what I think is interesting about the archmage category is not the archmage himself.  There are a decent number of archmages, no doubt.  But the fact that very few people take the time to strive to become an archmage.  Now, that is more likely than not simply a function of statistics.  Not everyone can be an archmage.  And certainly in our society where the knowledge economy is increasingly the most important thing, not everyone can become one of these cognitive elites because they just don't have the endowment.  Your average hedge wizard is not going to become an archmage or the head of some sorcerer's council.  That's just not how it works.  That said, that image of the archmage is typically not a goal or a vision of ambition for many people.  There's nothing particularly attractive, and I do mean this in a very real sense, in the sense that they're not very attractive people typically, or at the very least not exceptionally attractive, about pursuing some arcane art that most people can't comprehend.  For example, when Eric Weinstein talks about the geometry of the universe and all the curious, strange things that occur with geometry as if he's trying to divine the secrets of the universe, which he claims he is, and maybe he's succeeding.  I don't know.  I'm too dumb to figure that one out.  There's nothing attractive about the guy.  He's not an attractive guy, but what he's doing is so far removed and so difficult to grasp for the average person, it might as well just be high wizardry, level 10 spells, to use Dungeons & Dragons terms, spells that no one's ever going to cast.  Likewise, by way of analogy, we all know in traditional D&D, the spells you could learn and copy down your spell book, consequently, were limited by your intelligence.  And if you were a mage with only a 16 intelligence, you would never, unless you artificially inflate your intelligence via potions, magic, items,  etc.,  learn level 9 spells, which traditionally are the highest level spells.  So we have this strange class of archmage or archwizard But nobody really finds them attractive prospects to emulate.  That's the main thing.  On the other hand, you have this very real category of Chad, a somewhat new term, been around for some years, to describe somebody who is well-built, good-looking, et cetera, et cetera, typically male, almost always male.  And by way of contrast, if you look at the desire to emulate, to be male, This Chad figure, most people want to, at least if you contrast that with the desire to be an arch wizard or an arch mage.  Very few people are striving for these things that they can't even comprehend.  After all, most people can't even write these spells in their spell books.  But the more visceral thing, the more atavistic thing, looks, appearance, really that's what it's about, is something that people can relate to.  It's something that everybody can relate to because it resonates with us at a very instinctual level.  And so you have this Chad phenomenon.  But I'm going to argue here that the phenomenon of the Chad is essentially a distraction.  It's a distraction for a lot of people for the same simple reason that typically an archmage and his wizardry are not normal goals for people to chase after or emulate.  I'd argue the same thing for Chad.  The only difference being that the Chad resonates with us at the level of the instinctual, the visceral, that primitive desire that is completely lacking when we look at higher forms of magic as possessed by the cognitive elite and those who pursue those goals and that type of sorcery.  So in the thumbnail, you can see a very Chadly Jeff side.  He's a well-known fitness model.  but the reality is is that the vast vast vast majority of people will never look like that.  they simply don't have the genetics.  and this is why the chad image is ultimately i would argue far more destructive than in some ways the cognitively or these archmages.  because Even though I think there's a profound indifference stemming from the archmages towards the plebs, if you will, us, the rest of humanity, They don't cause the same amount of damage as obsession with looks, lookism, does in the masses.  Because for some reason, some convoluted reason, people get it into their heads that they can look like, say, Jeff Seid if they just work hard enough.  Now, do I think Jeff Seid is chemically enhanced?  Probably, but that's a minimal contributing factor when you look at his general structure.  He's just genetically gifted in this regard.  But everyone and his mother is going to tell you that if you work hard enough, you might be able to look like that, or at least you can approximate that, and that becomes the main goal of people.  In the lookism-obsessed society, a society, frankly speaking, that I didn't grow up in, at least as a young person, That becomes the main goal.  The archmage and his wizardry are just far too far removed from all of this.  But the chad is accessible, not because we can all be chads, but because it just resonates with the most primitive, atavistic instincts available to us.  We all recognize the value of looks, at least instinctually, and some of us go beyond that and recognize it at the level of social interaction and just how many benefits it might have.  So what ends up happening is a lot of guys chasing something that is functionally, and for all intents and purposes, unachievable.  Very, very few people are going to say be like a Jeff Seid.  Very few people are going to be chads.  And why?  Because they simply don't have the genetic endowment.  And some people would argue that that in itself would be some type of death sentence.  I don't necessarily think that's the case.  What I do think, though, is that the striving and obsession with chaddom, for lack of a better word, has created all sorts of unnecessary distractions for young men in particular who are at least smart enough to pursue hobbies and things that might interest them and preoccupy them in ways that don't occur to them right now because they're just following the trend, and the trend is this obsession with chaddom, looking this way, doing certain things in emulation, in the hopes that one might be like this, even though physical structures like that are as rare as the mind of, say, Eric Weinstein or Peter Thiel.  They just don't happen all the time.  It's a very rare event indeed.  So this preoccupation with lookism, this obsession, and not just focusing on yourself and the things that interest you, the things that keep you contented, That seems to be, to my mind, the most damaging aspect of this in the culture.  People are so obsessed with this.  I mean, you see it in the incel phenomenon.  You see it in the FA phenomenon.  Lookism is real.  It's real.  But the question is, is it a productive use of your time?  I'll pose the question to you, for example.  Me, the short, non-athletic guy, even if I were a young man, which I'm certainly not, would it have been a worthwhile effort training to become a professional basketball player or professional sprinter?  Probably not, because it just simply was not in the cards for me.  And so many people spend inordinate amounts of time these days invested in these types of pursuits.  Even though they seem to me clearly bankrupt in the sense that they cannot be achieved, most people aren't going to be Olympic class sprinters.  Most people aren't going to be like Peter Thiel.  Most people aren't going to be like Jeff Seid.  Yet, through no fault of their own, I have to admit, through the force of the media, rather, and the presentation of these things, they're told that they should be and must be.  Should have, would have, could have.  Yeah, it's all well and good.  But if something's functionally not achievable, I consider it a waste of time to even pursue in the slightest, unless you have different reasons.  So for example, you could perfectly come up with a reason to go to the gym for the sake of health.  It prevents muscular atrophy.  You feel better, endorphins, et cetera, et cetera.  These are reasons to go to the gym.  But if you think, unless you're extremely gifted, that you're going to look like Jeff Seid going to the gym, Well, you're sorely mistaken.  And though a muscular, lean physique improves everyone's appearance, I'm not sure if that's the end goal for a lot of guys.  I'm not sure if most guys even want that.  Think about all the things you can look at, study, take an interest in these days.  And think about all the distractions out there.  tearing you away from it constantly, gnawing at your metaphorical soul.  You need to look like this.  You need to obsess about this.  And this is, of course, a recurrent theme to me because this is what I find so worrying about things like F.A.  or the incel phenomenon, as opposed to going your own way, although there can be crossover, I suppose there is.  Because these people are much less focused on the things they really enjoy, and they're much more focused on taking in the current picture of the world, which is obsessed with things that are unachievable.  It just is the way it is.  Now, I'm not saying that going your own way is a solution to all of this.  It's not.  There are no solutions, only trade-offs.  But in the earlier days of going your way discussion and philosophy, there was an intense focus on oneself, not necessarily self-improvement per se, although a lot of people called it that.  Self-improvement in the mass media sense, of course, means go to the gym, brah, lift hard, brah, slay the pussy, brah.  not that but just focusing on yourself and things that bring you contentment outside of the feminine factor.  that just is completely absent in what you could view as different branches within the manosphere this obsession with this and it really is a distraction because so much of it is unachievable.  and mind you i probably would be saying the same thing if every tom dick and harry said that they wanted to be an archmage.  not everyone is going to be an archmage it's the same principle.  These people, whether they're the physique elite such as Jeff Seid, mind elite such as Eric Weinstein, they're going to do their thing completely separate from the rest of us.  And in the middle, not directly in the middle, but in that huge swath of human beings between those different ends of the distribution curve, you're going to have people who become very preoccupied, not primarily with the Archmage and his wizardry, but rather with the people like Jeff Side.  Look, I can appreciate a good physique like anybody else, guys well built as an example, but is it a good use of your time if you have average or subpar genetics becoming a gym rat trying to be something that you're simply not meant to be?  Again, if you want to go to the gym because it's healthy or you feel better for doing it, that's fine.  But if you want to go to the gym to achieve something that is functionally, physiologically unachievable for you, that's a waste of time.  Likewise, there's not much you can do if you're not born a Chad in terms of your appearance.  That simply is the way it is.  You have to make do with what you have.  Yet, in the current lookism-obsessed climate we live in, that becomes a very, very difficult prospect, particularly for younger men.  Everything is predicated on that.  So what you get is oftentimes smart young men who are spending all their time thinking about getting a girlfriend and being with women and doing all the things that are required to do so, supposedly, and not pursuing the things they could otherwise have done, such as studying chemistry, mathematics, history, whatever it might be that they have an interest in.  And this is why the Chad as a symbol is a massive distraction for the vast, vast majority of people.  Again, we can all admire beauty and a handsome face or whatever, a body.  That's fine.  But because that's become the centerpiece of all social gravity, it's become a huge hindrance to people, specifically young men, simply trying to develop interests that they have because they're wasting so much time on things that are not beneficial to them because they're not going to achieve these things.  And that's the problem with the Chad and the Archmage.  Nobody really wants to be an Archmage per se.  It's too obscure.  It's too difficult to understand.  I don't understand the mathematical concepts Eric Weinstein is talking about.  I'm not that smart.  But everybody can understand the appeal of some fitness model or some Chad who simply was born with the good fortune of having good looks and thus everything tends to rotate on that access as opposed to the other.  A lot of depressed, unhappy, disappointed young men who have become completely neurotic in their obsession with this stuff and disregard all sorts of other things that might be of interest to them and might even preoccupy their time as opposed to the effete and feeble attempts to emulate something they're never going to be and I wish more people would think about this from this perspective.  Ultimately these guys are squandering the best years of their life trying to do something that really will not bring them fulfillment and will not get them where they want to go because If they were going to go there, they would have been born that way.  Chadness or chaddom, however you want to term it, is conceived in the womb, for better or worse.  It's just something we need to live with.  On the other hand, nobody's really complaining that they're not smart enough to understand the discrete properties of geometry in the universe and how this might solve the question of the portal and how that helps us understand the basic fundamental elements of the universe.  Anyway, some commentary for today, because this is an important topic.  It's really gone overboard, especially in recent years.  And I hope some people can... get off that bandwagon and get back to just focusing on themselves and trying to do things for themselves independent of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune from social media and the like.  As always, if I'm still alive, I'll talk to you later.  Until then, may the gods watch over you.  Bye-bye.  If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe.
