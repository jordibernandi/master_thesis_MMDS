Although there were quite a few philosophers who contributed to this line of thought, such as Nietzsche or Kierkegaard, Sartre really brought existentialism under the spotlight and shaped it into a defining theory.  The central core principle of existentialism is that existence precedes essence. ",

There are millions of different types of chairs in existence, each one completely different to the other.  Yet, there is something within each of those chairs that makes them chairs.  This is because each one has the essence of a chair.  It possesses the defining attributes that make it a chair, namely legs, a seat, and a structure enabling people to sit on it.  This is the essence of a chair.  I see.  Now, philosophers up until the 20th century followed what is known as essentialism, dating right back to the ancient Greek thought that each person has their own innate essence that makes them who they are.  So you, John, you have an essence that makes you you.  This essence is innate.  It preceded you.  You were born with this essence already programmed.  The fundamental essence of John, what makes John John, was an attribute determined, something you had no part or choice in. ",

We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world and defines himself afterward.

So once we are thrown into this world, we eventually gain self-awareness, and we have to make our choices.  With no essence, no purpose, and no innate meaning, we have to create all these things for ourselves through our free choices.  We are responsible for what we become.

When Sartre is talking about freedom, he does not mean that unlimited choices are available to every person at every moment in time, but rather, there is a choice to make, and we must then deal with the consequences of that choice, and then we are faced with new choices, and we must choose, and we must deal with the consequences of those choices, and so on and so on.  Even not choosing is a choice, you are choosing not to choose.  okay so in the case of the prisoner they still have a choice.  they can choose to remain imprisoned and hate it.  they can choose to remain imprisoned and embrace it.  they can choose to try and escape or they can choose to end it all.  either way there are choices and the free human must choose and must deal with the consequences of their choice.  as sartre explained those who live not knowing of their freedom and their choices are living in bad faith.  Those who claim they must do something, they have to live a certain way or things have to be a certain way or that there are no options or choices, this is bad faith.  We are free agents and we are always free to choose.  yes i understand so this is it?  in a nutshell our existence precedes our essence.  our essence is developed by us by our free choices and this heavy responsibility should bring us all a little anguish truly fascinating even an empowering theory.
