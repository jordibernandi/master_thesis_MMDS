Clear Channel, over time, turned into a right wing network.  Romney took it over.  You've got now Sinclair.  I mean, there's just place after place after place where we're seeing these happening. ",

I'm sure the losses went down over that five-year period, so he probably lost $200 million, $300 million before he started making money.  Air America went bankrupt.  Around either 14 or 17 million dollars.  That's Trump change right in the media world.  I mean, that's that's the budget for any one of the shows on MSNBC right now.  I mean for one hour, right?  That's the entire annual budget.  In fact, that might even be the paycheck for you know, some of the talent.  so it's just for For some reason, you know, Randy Rhoads and I and me and I'm forgetting who all was there now, but there were about a dozen of us who were in progressive media in the very early days of Air America, went to Washington, D.C.  and met with a group of senators.  and democratic senators and said, you guys need to focus on media.  Media is the whole game.  If you control the media, you control everything.  That's why every dictator, first thing they do is they take over the media.

I literally started when I was 16.  This was back in the 60s and 70s.  And so I understand the business, and I understand what goes into it.  And so I wrote this op-ed called Talking Back to Talk Radio that Common Dreams published in, I think, the late winter, early, I think it was like January, February of 2003, in which I said, you know, half of America is Democratic, and there's like, you know, 800 right-wing radio stations.  There's a business model here.  Somebody could make some money.  And Shelly Drobny called me up and I went out to Chicago and met with him and his wife Anita and helped them put together Air America Radio.  My article became their first business plan.  But their idea for how to do radio was different from mine.  And so I went back to Vermont and thought, I'm going to do a proof of concept.  If I can demonstrate that this is viable, then maybe other people who have media savvy and who are liberals will do it themselves.  I had no plans to create a show that would last 15 years. ",

And after about three months, we got picked up by the only liberal network that existed at that time.  It was owned by the UAW.  It was out of Detroit.
