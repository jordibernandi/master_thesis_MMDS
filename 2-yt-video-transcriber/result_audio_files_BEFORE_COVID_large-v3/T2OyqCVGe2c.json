            "text": "Some big documents out of the IRS as a result of Judicial Watch FOIA litigation.  These documents show that a top McCain staffer suggested that Lois Lerner's IRS engage in financially ruinous activities.  audits of political groups.  It's pretty unbelievable stuff.  I'm going to get into the details here.  So what was going on?  is that the IRS in 2013, just a few weeks before it was exposed that they were targeting conservative and Tea Party groups with suppression, by asking too many questions in their questionnaires, in their applications, in a way that were questions that were both invasive and unnecessary, and stalling and delaying the approval of those applications.  Just two weeks before, we have documents showing there was a meeting with top IRS officials, between top IRS officials, and Senate staffers for Senator Carl Levin, who's a Democrat from Michigan, and Senator John McCain, who is the Republican senator from Arizona.  And these staffers browbeat Lois Lerner and top IRS officials over their regulation of 501c4 groups, basically political groups.  The background on this is that Democrats and people like John McCain\u2014 who have been on the side of the left in terms of regulating government speech were furious when the Citizens United case came down.  You may recall President Obama attacked the Supreme Court to its face during a State of the Union address over the Citizens United decision, which was a 5-4 decision that upheld the First Amendment on the encroachments by the McCain-Feingold bill that would have regulated the speech of entities engaged in political advocacy or talking about candidates and government officials.  So they were furious at that.  So they thought of ways around that, especially certainly from the Democratic perspective in the 2010-2012 elections where they didn't want Tea Party groups and other Republican-oriented groups, or so they thought, participating in the elections in a way that would have harmed their ability to keep and maintain and obtain power.  So this is what the background is on all of that.  So they were pressuring the IRS.  The Obama gang was pressuring the IRS.  Senator Levin was pressuring the IRS.  And now it looks like Senator McCain, through this staffer, was pressuring the IRS.  So we had reported on this meeting the fact that it took place back in 2015 initially.  And the notes of the meeting seemingly were redacted.  But subsequently, in the tens of thousands of pages that we have gotten since then and around then, we found the notes.  And the notes of the meeting are pretty extraordinary because the staff director for McCain at the time, Mr.  Henry Kerner, said to Ms.  Lois Lerner and the other staffers, you should include, let's see, they're talking about 501c4 groups, audit so many that it becomes financially ruinous.  Audit so many that it becomes financially ruinous.  And they didn't get any pushback from the IRS about it other than the fact that it was maybe not within their, they didn't have the budget to do so.  And I'll give you the full context.  Henry Kerner, let me turn my glasses on, Henry Kerner asked how to get to the abuse of organizations claiming Section 501C4, but designed to be primarily political.  Lois Lerner said the system works, but not in real time.  Henry Kerner, again, this is the McCain staffer, noted that these organizations don't disclose donors.  which is their right under the First Amendment, Lois Lerner said if they don't meet the requirements, we can come in and revoke, but it doesn't happen timely.  Nan Marks, who's another IRS official, said if the concern is that organizations engaging in this activity don't disclose donors, then the system doesn't work.  Well, they're bureaucrats.  They're just supposed to follow the law, not try to work around it through regulations.  Henry Kerner said that maybe the solution is to audit so many that it is financially ruinous.  Again, Henry Kerner, the Minority Staff Director for John McCain on his committee, said that maybe the solution is to audit so many that it is financially ruinous.  Nicole, who is?  Nicole Flax, who was the then Chief of Staff, I think to the Commissioner, noted that we have budget constraints.  Elise Bean, who was the Democrat staff member from the Senate, suggested using a list of organizations that made independent expenditures.  Lois Lerner said that it was her job to oversee it all, not just political campaign activity.  None of that is reassuring, obviously.  So who is this Henry Kerner? ",
