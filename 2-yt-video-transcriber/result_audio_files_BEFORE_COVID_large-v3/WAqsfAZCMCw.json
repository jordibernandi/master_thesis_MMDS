            "text": "My granddaddy, he was a pastor for over 40 years.  He was a short man, but he used to love to drive big cars.  And he drove a Cadillac.  And these little cute Cadillacs now you can put in your pocket.  No, uh-uh.  He drove a Cadillac when it was a Cadillac.  Y'all know what I'm talking about?  Like, his car started at that wall, went all the way back to that wall.  You know, you couldn't drive it like this.  Child, you had to drive it like this.  Y'all know what I'm talking about?  It didn't, you didn't have seat belts.  You can just put 20 kids on the back row.  It didn't even matter.  You didn't need no child seat either.  You just put the baby in the back window.  You just got to roll them over every 15 minutes to make sure they don't burn up.  Y'all know what I'm talking about?  So I'll never forget.  Cause he would pride himself on being able to drive these long distances and stuff.  So he, I never forget.  My name was Albert, but he, but I'm a junior.  but he called me June because he couldn't get the extra syllable out for the energy, you know?  So he said, June, I'm going to shut my eyes and I'm going to let you drive.  And I said, okay, granddaddy.  So, you know, y'all, I'm 16, 17 years old and I'm, y'all, I'm driving.  I'm driving.  Watch me whip.  Watch me, baby.  I'm driving, you know?  And then I've been driving about 15, 20 seconds.  He said, June, son, speed this thing up.  We want to get you there before sunrise.  I said, okay, granddaddy, and I speed up, and man, about another 30, 35 seconds.  June, boy, slow this thing down now, son.  We ain't running no race.  He said, okay, granddaddy, so I slow it down, you know, another 10, 30 seconds.  June, by this time, I could feel my grandmother getting irritated in her sanctified soul.  She... She leaned over, she said, oh, I thought you said you was going to shut your eyes.  See, in his head, he wanted me to drive.  In his will, he gave me the keys.  He wanted me to drive.  But in his heart, he was still driving.  Sometimes I wonder if God peers over the balcony of heaven and says to you and I, oh, I thought you said you was going to shut your eyes and trust me.  I thought you said you was going to shut your eyes and trust me with the kids this year.  I thought you said you was going to shut your eyes and trust me with the marriage.  I thought you said you was going to shut your eyes and trust me with the finances.  I thought you said you was going to shut your eyes and trust me with the relationships.  Remember, you said you was going to be single, and you was just going to trust God and not get in another bad relationship.  And remember, it was New Year's Eve, and you was crying, writing in your journal, said, Jesus, you're going to be my man this year, and I ain't heard from you since then.  And now, you know, it's almost February, and you come talking about some help.  pray for me and Gus.  And Jesus is like, who is Gus?  I never heard of Gus.  Where did Gus come from, huh?  I don't know Gus.  What would it mean for you to shut your eyes and trust God?  See, the problem is some of us, we are backseat drivers.  Like my wife.  My wife, it's a gift.  She has a gift of backseat driving.  It's a gift.  At least that's what the therapist said.  I need to start to refer to it as.  Says, Albert, you need to get better language.  It is a gift.  So, and I struggle with appreciating her gift because all of a sudden she'll just get an utterance and she'll declare prophetically how it is that I should, you know, navigate the vehicle that I'm driving.  So... Just the other day I messed up you ever.  just the other day you have us have some come out your mouth.  And when the words come out your mouth you see them and you be thinking that ain't gonna land.  well That's not gonna land well at all.  I just had words come up y'all we're driving another day, and I couldn't catch it.  I couldn't catch it.  I messed up I messed up y'all we driving and she just got one of those prophetic utterances.  You know what I mean cuz you know.  and she says.  She says to me, she says, ain't that the turning lane?  And I said, ain't that the passenger seat?  I tried to get, it was like slow motion.  I said, no.  Don't feel bad for her though.  When we got home, she said, ain't that the couch?  Touche, my dear, touche.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, You haven't given the keys to some young, inexperienced 16 year old.  You have the creator of all things, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the God Almighty.  He says, I wanna drive.  You need to shut your eyes and trust me.  Belief is the idea of getting in the backseat, allowing God to drive you, shedding your eyes and say, God, I will trust you.  Belief is saying I will rest in who you are and what you are doing in my life.  Let me tell you something.  Everybody talking about they trust God.  But let me tell you, if you ain't rested in God, then you ain't trusting God because to trust God is to rest in God. ",
