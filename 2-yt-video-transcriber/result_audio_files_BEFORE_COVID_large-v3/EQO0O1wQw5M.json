            "text": "News Now.  KC, Blanchard, Oklahoma.  The city where OKC Vet HPA, holding police accountable, has had an issue with the police.  I am at their city hall.  And I'm going to work my way down to the PD here shortly.  But we're out back.  We're going to make our way around front.  I'm going to put it on pause and just walk around for a few and then go in.  Save you the agony of just a lot of dead action here.  Okay.  Just walked around the parking lot.  Let's check out the back here.  Sorry about the wind.  Very windy day here.  I guess they have barbecues.  Never seen that before, lack of agenda.  So you don't have much going on here.  Let's see if we can see inside.  Yes, we can.  Cameras work great for seeing through.  Seeing through these types of windows.  Fire department headed somewhere.  Can't see through these windows.  Some you can, some you can't.  They might have curtains on the other side so it's black.  City of Blanchard, Oklahoma.  Driving Metropolis.  Subway, barbershop.  My hat on.  Oh, I'm just going to look around here.  Do some video.  Okay.  Are we going to see if there's anything I can help you with?  Sure will.  Thank you.  Uh-huh.  All right, we'll chase off to the PD now.  It's just around the corner.  There's more to see on this side of the street.  That's why I came over here first.  I know I've been here before, videoed, but I think it was late at night.  There's siren.  We're here.  Fishing reels.  I hadn't seen the road in a little bit.  It's dirty.  Excuse me.  Fire department's rolling.  They have a call, I assume.  Can't see much through the glare.  The side window works best for this.  A few cars out back.  It's probably the jalopy lot right there.  All right.  We'll go inside.  Can't see.  Hello.  Do you have any gun locks?  I might get a gun lock.  Thank you.  Oh, no, that's it.  I'm just going to get some video.  No.  Yeah, I don't need any more assistance.  I appreciate it.  It means you can't act up in the police department.  Hey, sir.  How's it going?  Tim, Stace White.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you, sir.  Good to meet you, sir.  I like what you're doing, man.  Oh, do you really?  Yeah.  I'll watch it.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  I'm a big 2A supporter.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Are you going to watch the rally up in Broken Arrow?  Probably if I have time.  That's June 1st on a Saturday.  Is it?  Okay.  You should show up.  I teach 2A classes, too.  Okay.  You should show up.  Come to Broken Arrow and walk with us.  That's a long drive, bro.  It is.  It is.  Probably 120 miles from here.  I saw your memory on K2A.  Yeah.  So am I. Oh, okay.  You are?  Well, thank you.  Dee Dobson's a friend of mine.  Okay.  Yeah.  Does he work at the school?  She's over in Sepulpa right now.  Sepulpa.  Okay.  All right.  She's supposed to be running for office.  I hope she does.  yeah we need more 2a people in there.  um there's a lot of people upset about some of the audits that we've been doing open carrying but they've got a meeting tonight.  november 1st changes it all brother it does.  how do you feel about that?  as law enforcement officer i'm fine with it fine with it.  good like i said i'm a 2a supporter man.  yeah okay i served.  you know the marine corps and you know just yeah it's one of those things that i like you know what marine stands for.  If you tell me something to do, I got to go ahead.  My ass rides in Navy equipment.  I've heard that one.  Yeah, it's true.  Were you in the Navy?  Yeah.  Boiler tech, yeah.  Okay, well, you know, I'm done.  All right.  I just didn't.  Well, I'm going to video a little more and probably upload this later tonight.  Cool.  Have a good day, sir.  You too.  Have a great one.  Take care of yourself.  You too.  Bye-bye.  Alright, there you go guys.  Successful audit Blanchard, OK.  Not one issue.  chief of police watches my channel so.  Alright, news now.  OK, see Blanchard, OK.  I'm going to hit the burrito shack over here.  Upload this video.  Be sure and go to the.  The rally.  I want to plug that.  Broken Arrow, OK.  June 1st 10 AM.  at Nine House Park.  It's an open carry rally.  You're welcome to bring pistols, AR pistols, AK pistols, with a permit in Oklahoma.  On November 1st, as the Chief said, everything changes, then you'll be able to carry rifles without a permit in Oklahoma.  So, I'd like to see everybody there, and yes, we are raffling or giving away, or something, I guess like Richard Hubbard was carrying and got arrested with.  All right, guys, news now, KC, clear.
