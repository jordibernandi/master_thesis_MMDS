All you have to do is simply answer the questions that I'm asking.  You're doing a job, right?  You uphold the Constitution.  It's your job, right?  Pretty much arrest people for arrestable offenses.  What you're arresting me for?  And I ran into you while I was looking for her.  Okay.  Right or wrong, ma'am?  Lincoln 785, 10-59.  Lincoln 785.  Miss Blair, I appreciate you.  Bronte County, one adult male, beginning mileage 96.  Like I told you before, no, I'm not towing your car.  So this is what you do?  Nothing.  You don't answer any questions.  I'm asking you so I will not answer any questions.  I answered all your questions.  Actually, no, you didn't.  I'm pretty sure you answered about none of them.  Okay, I appreciate you.  then, Ms.  Bell.  My question to you was, do you sleep well at night when you do things like this?  No.  Are you turning the radio up so I won't hear you?  Because you don't sleep well?  No.  Jail doesn't bother me.  It's what you're doing that bothers me the most.  Look at my record.  I've been in jail.  It doesn't bother me.  What bothers me is what you're doing.  As a black female, that you would find innocent black men.  I don't know how that works for Americans, you know?  You need to turn the radio off because you don't want to hear what I got to say, right?  You want to turn the radio down for a second?  It would be great if you didn't put things in my mouth.  Thank you.  Lincoln 732.  Glad how just after 30 minutes you know exactly who I am.  That's amazing.  You proved to me.  That you did for me, man.  I'm cool with it, though.  I'm just making you understand my point.  You can drop me off.  Lincoln 785, 23 ending 98.  Lincoln 785, 10-4, 15-58.  I still don't know what I'm being arrested for.  But I guess I'll find out when I find out.  766, go ahead and send the other call.  Hello?  Yes.  Is it because it wasn't originally a traffic stop?  Oh, okay.  Okay. ",
