Free agency officially will start on Wednesday, but the Buffalo Bill is very active on day one here.  The big splashy signing, Mitch Morris Center, former Kansas City Chief, seems to have come to an agreement to play for the Buffalo Bills for the next four seasons.  Ryan, this was the top position of need.  We've talked about it over and over again.  A lot of people kind of had Matt Paradise as that number one center.  Some people had Mitch Morris.  What's your first thoughts on the signing? ",

I mean, like you said, I think many of them were saying, okay, they have to either get Matt Paradis or they have to go out and get Mitch Morse.  And for a while, you had heard reports that the Bills and the Jets were both bidding for Paradis.  And then all of a sudden, there was the announcement that the Bills had agreed to terms with Mitch Morse.  Four years, $11 million on average per year.  which was to be expected after what you saw Ponce get in Pittsburgh last week, or a few days ago, not even one week ago.  So nothing too unexpected there, but you get that veteran leadership at center.  You get a guy who is just coming off of a season where he worked with a second-year quarterback and helped Patrick Mahomes do wonders.  Now, mind you, Mahomes obviously did a lot of that on his own with his arm and everything, with his ability to read defenses.  But Morris deserves some credit, too, for allowing him to come right into the lineup and transition so smoothly in that role.  So I think this is a great signing for the Bills, and I think it's an even better signing for Josh Allen. ",

One of the premier pass blocking offensive linemen in the NFL.  And, you know, when you're building an offense around a franchise quarterback, a young quarterback like Josh Allen.  Ryan Groy and Russell Bodine, 10 starts for Bodine, 6 for Groy.  They didn't give up any sacks last year either, but they both gave up 16 hurries of Josh Allen.  Last season, Mitch Morse only gave up 3.  This guy comes with that package of... A, you're going to get a guy that has experience winning.  B, you're going to get a guy that's going to protect your quarterback.  And C, you have an area of development.  I think that's something that this regime really thrives on under Sean McDermott and Brandon Bean.  Getting guys in here and stressing the development.  Okay, you're a great pass blocker.  We need you to improve the run game.  That's going to be something that I can motivate you on a daily basis.  It's going to be a big task for Bobby Johnson.  You're going to look at what that coaching staff was able to do in Indianapolis with that offensive line last year.  It was impressive.  And so you're wondering, can Bobby Johnson bring that over to Buffalo under Brian Dable, who has experience coaching on the offensive line, spend some time relearning the offensive line with Dante Skarnecchia up in New England?  It's an interesting tidbit that I got from Brandon Bean when I spoke to him back during the season.  is that when things were going bad for Brian Dable and he had two stints as offensive coordinators that were flops, he walked away from coaching for a little bit, went back and just became an assistant just to kind of be a fly on the wall and spent a whole season picking Dante Skarnecchia's brain up in New England.  And obviously he's made a lot of money for Nate Soldier and Trent Brown these last two off seasons.  So you're hoping that Brian Dable now is building a... environment here of learning and development.  Hopefully that also works with Bobby Johnson, but I think across the board, it's a great signing.

He gave up eight sacks allowed last year, which when I went back and looked at the numbers, I mean, that even popped a little bit for me.  So you're going to see him probably refocused.  You figure that they're going to hopefully... go after one more player in free agency, and then the draft is wide open to just bring in the best possible fits at positions.  You bring up a name like maybe Dalton Reisner from Kansas State, somebody we've talked about quite a bit.  But the possibilities are there because you took this first step. ",

Pick away the layers here at this signing.  It's hard not to really, you know, like what Brandon Bean was able to do with this.  First of all, you know, it's a very good contract.  You know, you look at it very front loaded.  It's a three year deal around 18 million.  But, you know, the bills don't have a. they're not on the line for much in 2020 and 2021.  Mike Rodak from ESPN put out a nice tweet a few moments ago kind of laying all of that out, the contract details.  And I think that was the key to this.  You wanted to go out and spend on one of the free tight ends that you thought could come in and help you right away.  But you're not tied to them long term because that allows you now to go and draft somebody in a deep tight end draft and start developing them for the future. ",

Maybe the Bills go out and get TJ Hawkinson or Noah Font or Irv Smith Jr.  Those are the big three names you're going to hear over and over again leading up to the draft.  And maybe then Tyler Croft isn't needed as much in 2020-2021.  And like you said, Mike Rodak really broke down this contract.  It's only 8.3 of the 18.75 million is guaranteed.  Like you said, front loaded though, you can get rid of him fairly easily if he doesn't produce, if he's dealing with injuries.  which was what happened last year.  So, you know, it's another nice job by Brandon Bean when you really see how the contract breaks down.  It's another or it's a perfect example of not overreacting to the contract when you first see the numbers because, again, NFL teams can manipulate those numbers and make them look bad.  a lot better than they really are when you first see how it comes out.  But this is a guy that in 2017 had seven touchdowns, had a nose for getting in the end zone, was rather productive with the Bengals, and I think he can come in and compete with Jason Kroon.  They can kind of push one another, but they can also help a rookie that's going to be in that tight end room.  But by all estimations, you would think that the Bills are going to add another tight end here in this draft class. ",

You had Keith McKellar, you had Jay Reimersma, obviously, later in the 1990s.  They've had some people that have come in and done some things in terms of receptions, yards, touchdowns, blocking.  But they've never really had that big-name player that could come in that puts up a lot of touchdowns.  And I'm not saying that Croft will be that guy.

You bring in a guy like a Frank Gore, a proven veteran guy that, you know, is still motivated, you know, 500 some odd yards away from, you know, moving into third place all time, passing Barry Sanders if he was able to do that.  So he's still motivated.  You know he's going to want to get his yards.  Number two, he's close with LaShawn McCoy, which is a twofold.  One, maybe keep LaShawn McCoy in check.  And two, motivate LaShawn McCoy because they're so close and they train together.  And three, it might allow you to, you know, Get rid of Chris Ivory, who was okay last year.  I didn't really have any problems with how Chris Ivory played last year, especially in the passing game.  I thought he was more effective in the passing game than McCoy for the most part.  But it allows you to potentially shed a lot of that money.  I think it's almost $2 million the Bills would save if they get rid of Chris Ivory, and that's how much they're paying for one year of Frank Gore. ",

And that streak ended last year in Miami.  So this is something that was the majority of his career.  He was putting up a lot of rushing yards.  Some seasons he was putting up a fair amount of receiving yards, nothing too eye-popping.  But he had a nice mix there, especially these last few years, to help him get over that 1,000-yard threshold.  And now you bring him to Buffalo.  He's a nice complement in terms of his running style.  to LeSean McCoy.  He still is a hard runner, but despite his age, despite his workload, here's a guy that still looks like he has a lot of tread on the tires.  He's going to help in the blocking game. ",

Devin Funches with the eye-popping one-year $13 million deal with the Colts.  Only 10 of it is guaranteed.  But that was somebody that, you know, Bill's fans, I think, were almost fearful of Brandon being going back to the Carolina well and signing Devin Funches.  But he's off the board.  But if we could, you know, looking ahead to tomorrow and Wednesday, if there's one wide receiver at this point that you're just like, you know, go all in?

He did produce when he was given the opportunity.  I'll give him that.  And if he truly does want to prove himself, well, what better place than Buffalo where you automatically come in and you're slotted in as the number one wide receiver.  It addresses a major need.  It allows the Bills to possibly kind of sit back on this wide receiver draft class and maybe grab a guy in the middle rounds.  rather than have to get someone in round one or round two.  You know, a nice compliment to Robert Foster.  Zay Jones has a lot of talent, has a skill set that matches up nicely with Josh Allen.

But the price tag does worry me a little bit.  I know the Bills do have that cap space to play with, but I just keep hearing Brandon Bean saying over and over again in my head that he wants to be judicious and in the way that he spends that money.  And it would be quite the gamble.  Now, it might be worth it, might not.  That's neither here nor there.  But I think a safer option would be to go back to the well again, using the same phrase, and go back and try to talk to John Brown, who showcased some real skills early on last season, paired with the strong-armed quarterback of Joe Flacco in Baltimore.  Things kind of fell off when Lamar Jackson came in, and that also brings to the point, well, is that because he's a running quarterback?  But I think Josh Allen is able to throw the ball a little bit more, do a little bit more in the passing game.  And I think a versatile weapon like John Brown, which you can get at a very, likely a very affordable deal.  I also, I really think that, you know, Brian Dable could work wonders with Golden Tate.  You know, he's obviously a little bit older, probably going to command a three-year deal and get, you know, $11 or $12 million a year.  But that's a guy that's proven in this league to be able to make plays, get separation, and has demonstrated the versatility to be used in various spots in the formation.  And I think that's, you know, that's what they've been selling over at One Bill's Drive with Brian Dable running this offense.  is he will find a way to get the ball in the playmaker's hands.  And to me, on this free agent market, there's no better playmaker right now than Golden Tate. ",

You have Randall Cobb out there, Dante Moncrief, Phillip Dorsett.  There are still some players out there that, especially if they're looking for speed, some of those later names that I mentioned, could come in and contribute, not saying they'd be a number one wide receiver in Buffalo, nor should they.  But there are still some guys out there.  Maybe Buffalo waits for the market to settle.  Maybe Tyrell Williams is too much for them.  And maybe that ends up being the same for John Brown, although I don't think he's going to get more than he did last year, especially, like you said, based on that fall off that we saw when Lamar Jackson came in.  So there are still plenty of names out there.  I know that fans... We're probably sitting on the edge of their seat saying, okay, who's next?  Who's next?  Who's next?  Well, they already worked out three deals today, at least, you know, in agreement, obviously.  So they've been fairly active.  I think, you know, tomorrow, maybe there's another signing or two, but, but I think that they might wait for the second wave, so to speak, to come in.  If they can't get one of their top targets or top two targets at wide receiver, same going for right tackle.  You know, we haven't heard much today about Daryl Williams or Juwan James and Who knows what's going on there, but if they miss on their top targets.  there too, maybe you wait for that second wave where the price comes down and you get a guy that you say, okay, this is still someone who is potentially better than Jordan Mills.  This is still someone that maybe we don't have to draft an offensive tackle in round one.  So it's going to be interesting to see what they do because they've already gone out and they've already addressed three needs here on day one, depth at running back, possibly starting tight end, and then obviously the big move with Mitch Morris at center.  So I'm intrigued to see what happens tomorrow as well. ",
