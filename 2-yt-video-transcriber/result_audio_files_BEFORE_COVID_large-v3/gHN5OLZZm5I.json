He's actually a YouTuber, but he'd been on Twitter and had posted something that Twitter just sort of arbitrarily deemed unacceptable.  And he's been banned outright.  I was speaking to Armin Navabi at Atheist Republic about this.  And Armin thought that we should have a conversation with apostate prophet who joins me here.  My friend, it's good to have you.  Tell me a little bit about what you're going through real fast and why and let the listeners in on some of this dust up regarding Twitter and the ban.  Okay. ",

What has been happening recently is that I had a Twitter account linked to my YouTube account known as Apostate Prophet.  And several months ago, I made a tweet there in which I tweeted something very basic in response to someone who told us that Islam is a religion of peace because she was never allowed to kill spiders.  I said, Islam orders the killing of apostates, adulterers, gays, heretics, critics of Islam, etc.  Islam orders to spread the religion by the sword and explicitly insults non-believers.  But Islam doesn't allow the killing of spiders.  Therefore, Islam is peace.  You know, in a mocking language, I pointed out the atrocities and the inhumanities ordered by the religion of Islam itself and mocked the idea of calling it peaceful just because it has this thing against spiders.  and The tweet went very well.  It started blowing up a little bit, and then just a day or two later, I suddenly one day woke up, wanted to get into Twitter, and saw a notice that I have been permanently suspended from Twitter just over this tweet, over hateful conduct, as Twitter calls it, which is ridiculous because there is nothing hateful about this.  I'm just criticizing a religion for its atrocities against basic human rights and protesting that and Just using a little bit of a sarcastic tone.  Well, after this, for several months, I kept on using my personal account, so people started following me there instead.  And that account was around long before this Apostate Profit account.  But just a few days ago, suddenly this account was banned as well.  And this time without any explanation.  They didn't cite any tweet, nothing at all.  They didn't even send me a notification nor an email.  I just logged in on Twitter and it suddenly said, your account has been suspended, permanently suspended.  And whenever I click on the prompts of finding out why, it just sent me to the standard banned accounts page, which is not helpful at all.  So I appealed, and they outright rejected that appeal as well.  It seems like an automated process, meanwhile. ",

You are in this scene in these times where many anti-theists, many atheists online make videos and posts and memes about Christianity and Christians and the Christian God and the Bible and Jesus and so on.  these people wouldn't ever be accused by the majority, by masses of being hateful.  These people are rightfully allowed to do this and they are seen as people who question, as people who are skeptics, who are progressives, whatever you want to call it.  The way people handle Islamophobia right now, as they call it, would be equal to To putting people like you or other people, other YouTubers, people who criticize Christianity and who criticize Christians, putting them and people who kill Christians into one category and calling that Christophobia.  That's what people are doing with Islamophobia right now.  I am not a person who has ever incited violence or hate against Muslims.  I wouldn't do that.  I have Muslim friends.  I have Muslim relatives.  My family are Muslims, you know.  I love them as people.  I don't hate them.  And I want to help people question their religion.  This is what I'm doing.  I want to keep this religion out of countries where it's currently not dominant.

You know, Twitter just deleted the tweet and didn't do anything about the person at all.  And this person was blatantly advocating the death penalty for basic human rights.  We have many people that I disagree with who can freely speak on Twitter.  I have only recently seen a tweet by a known academic person in America saying something like, uh effing white people.  which is if i said if i replaced white people with muslims and tweeted the same i would be definitely gone already.  and um i don't know.  there are so many people on twitter who who say all kinds of things and i don't agree with any of them.  but people don't have to agree with me either to to see that we all should be able to to be on these platforms where presidents and um Political parties, all kinds of official institutions, official organizations are on where we are supposed to be communicating with each other, where Donald Trump is making his political tweets, where he can't even block people because that's against the law.  We all should be able to participate on these platforms, on these new platforms.  this kind of new society.  I want to say something that I repeated in my video recently, which is people often bring up that Twitter and Facebook and other companies are just private companies and they can allow and reject whomever they want.  And there is no point in just telling them to allow us a platform.  But people wouldn't be saying the same thing if Twitter suddenly started banning people for being Muslim and for advertising and advocating Islam.  They wouldn't say the same thing if people were banned for being gay and for saying that being gay is awesome and that there is nothing wrong with it.  Or for transgender issues or for disabled people or for racism, you know, for race issues.  Whatever it is, people wouldn't say the same thing.  People wouldn't say these are just private companies.  They can do whatever they want.  And I want to just, I don't know, I want to remind everyone that we are We are people.  We are adults.  We should be able to criticize, to discuss, to listen to each other, or to mute each other if we want to, like adults, without giving platforms the ability to just shut each other down because we do things that some people don't agree with.
