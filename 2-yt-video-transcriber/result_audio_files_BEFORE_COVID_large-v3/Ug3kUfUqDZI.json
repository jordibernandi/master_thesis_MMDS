            "text": "Hello and welcome back to Redirecting.  Well, again, I have another one of those topics that I'm going to be talking about.  It's unfortunate, but this is what is happening today.  Of course, a lot of people, they choose celebrity gossip and things of that nature.  You have others who talk about gaming and others who talk about gardening.  I talk about some of everything on this channel.  Everyone has a different thing that they want to talk about, biblical topics, different religions, and so on and so on.  There is a plethora of things that you can hear about on YouTube.  But today, again, in this video, another black and white issue.  It's sad, but black and white issues are at the forefront.  If any of you know and understand biblical prophecy, instead of complaining about why we focus on topics such as this, you would do more research and understand that there is about to be a real shift.  Scripture says Jacob is the beginning of the world that follows and Esau is the end of the world.  okay there's a lot to be learned right there a lot to be understood.  okay not getting into the whole Jacob and Esau thing because some of you don't agree on who Esau is but I know for certainty that it's not some obscure black village in no man's land where there's a group of black people who are running things in the world if you know what I mean from a remote island somewhere and no one knows who they are.  but anyway I'm going to get into this email that was sent to me.  This is an email that was sent to me after I did the video that we should protect this black man and his water invention.  I talked about how.  in a subsequent video I talked about how he was explaining the destruction of the water machine that he took to Flint, Michigan.  Those people desperately needed this fresh water, but his machine was destroyed by professionals.  If you know what I mean.  Not some locals did that.  No way.  No thugs did that.  This was the job or the work of a professional.  That leads me to this email that I received.  In my personal email, apparently this person must have gotten my email from my channel.  I don't remember putting it on there, but it is there.  I don't need to remove that.  I don't need to remove it because for others who want to contact us about other business, they can.  I can choose to ignore this kind of stuff.  Anyway, it's a long email.  And I'm just going to kind of go through a little bit of it.  I'll just give you the atmosphere of the email.  Basically, it's an angry rant.  Okay.  And I don't even have to identify the person's race.  I don't have to identify it, but I can tell you in this email.  He's calling the inventor of this water machine a scammer and that I should do more due diligence before promoting a scammer such as this.  He goes on to call his invention complete bull BS, right?  And he put that in all caps.  He wants me to know this is complete bull.  Why are you pushing this?  Then he goes on to talk about how bacteria growth and all of this other stuff inside the machine.  He says, this is why all dehumidifiers tell you in bold letters, do not try to drink this effing water.  All that is in all caps, right?  He's talking about how other scientists have debunked his his work.  okay he says it's a effing scam.  people talking about the water machine.  okay and he's calling people dumb suckers.  now the reason why I'm sharing this with you.  I'm sharing this for a reason a lot of you may not understand it and it's not for everybody to understand everything.  his email is loaded with f-bombs and all kinds of stuff.  right and trying to discredit this black man's work.  And the reason he sent it to me apparently, and I don't know if he sent the same email to others, but I'm talking about the fact that he sent it to me.  He saw that I put a video out on this and so he felt the need to share with me how he believes this is complete BS and that scientists would not back up this.  And he's saying that there's another guy who has a channel who's a bonafide scientist.  who also makes other educational videos.  He has debunked about a half dozen of these harebrained schemes in the past years.  Now, Again, why am I talking about this?  For those of you who don't understand, that's why I did the video in the first place, that this black man needs to be protected.  Because you have people like this who are willing to send emails full of F-bombs and other words and slanderous statements and belittling statements and just all kinds of things to make it seem as if this black guy doesn't know what he's talking about or what he's doing.  He's implying that his machine could be dangerous to people's health.  All of this stuff, and he sends the email to little old me because that's the anger that's in them.  How dare you talk about this on your channel?  How dare you promote this on your channel?  So if they are willing to send emails and say all of this stuff, and anger and respond to a black man.  Oh, I can't forget this part.  Let me give you this part of the email.  This is a dead giveaway of exactly what is going on with this man and the many who think like him.  He says, you probably possibly think I'm jealous or something.  That was the first thing that came to my mind because they always are.  They always are.  there is a perpetual hatred that some of these people have for us.  And it shows up in ways like this.  Yes, you are jealous.  That's exactly why you're sending this email and making the statement that you're making, because you can't fathom that black people in this world have the skills and the knowledge to even do something like this.  Now, what I want to say too is this, you have major news networks, major news networks, television shows that have interviewed this man.  He has set before millions via television because other people are talking about this, interviewing him and saying all kinds of things about this incredible invention.  But yet, this guy is calling it all a scam.  Even though he has the machines to prove.  Now let me say this.  I do believe, and yes, this is a black and white issue.  I do believe that they have enough money and influence to convince the whole world that that machine is garbage.  They can put out documentaries, films, commercials, breaking news stories.  They can frame it up so nicely to where it would convince the most intelligent person that this guy created nothing but garbage.  They have done those things.  They can do it.  Anytime you do something that they don't like, They have a way of discrediting it because they own all the printing presses, the major printing presses, the television networks, the radio, the movie industry.  When you have all of that media, the internet, all of this stuff that's being dominated by a particular group, they can convince you that your whole life never existed.  And you will be sitting there wondering, am I in a third, fourth, fifth dimension somewhere?  Where am I?  Who am I?  So I wanted to share this with you because those of you who don't understand when I say protect this black man, if you don't understand that, that means you are in La La Land.  These people have the ability to make people disappear.  And you know what I'm talking about.  They have the ability to create whatever narrative they want.  Now, you can think I'm talking about the pygmy people if you want to, or some obscure African group of people if you want to.  When I say these people, in the context of what I just explained in this video, and you don't know who I'm talking about, then I don't know what I can do or say to ever reach you.  It is what it is, family.  This black man needs to be protected, and many other like him, you see.  Because there's a certain demographic who do not like the truth.  It is what it is, family.  And with that, I will say, Shalom.  Be sure to ring the bell to be notified of new uploads on this channel.  And also, comment, share, like, and subscribe. ",
