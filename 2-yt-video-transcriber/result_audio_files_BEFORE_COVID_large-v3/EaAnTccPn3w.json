            "text": "I think we as leaders sometimes have given our churches the wrong message.  The message we've been giving our churches is, be like Jesus, be Christ-like, be Christ-like.  Now, it's not a bad thing, but I was reading Gordon T. Smith, and he says this, and this was life-changing for me, and the messaging of what discipleship looked like for me, reflecting on John 15.  He says, the heart and soul of the Christian existence is not ultimately about being Christ-like.  It is rather that we, listen to this, we be united with Christ.  Think Ephesians, think Colossians, think Philippians.  That we be united with Christ.  So much contemporary reflection on the Christian life speaks of discipleship as becoming more and more like Jesus.  This is problematic because Christ-likeness is derivative.  It's a result, it's a product of union with Christ.  And to pursue it on its own actually distracts us from the true goal of the Christian life.  He's saying, don't just get up and say, be holy.  You say, be close to Jesus.  Figure out a way to get your proximity, your heart close to him.  And what will happen out of that is holiness.  It's derivative.  It's a result.  So if I just, I'm just starting at the end.  If I just say, be like Christ, how?  Get close to him.  delight in him as a bigger treasure than anything else that you've got.  Your house, your square footage, your money, your boat, your relationship, your marriage, love Jesus more than all of it.  That's how you end up becoming like him.  Listen.  I was at Bayside in the last six months or something, and they assigned me the resurrection of Jesus.  And I sat there and I said, look, there's a great apologetic in defense of the faith for the resurrection of Jesus.  The fact that there's a whole chapter in my book about it, about the reality of the resurrection, why you should believe it evidentially, historically.  See, I'm an evidential person.  I needed to follow the evidence.  I'm still a very, I don't believe anything unless there's evidence.  All right, my daughter, 12 years old, the other day for the first time ever, she said, I'm going to go for a walk with my friends.  We're going to go to the store without me around.  She said this.  Her and her friends are just going to go to the store on a walk?  Are you kidding?  There's rapists.  There's all kinds of people out there.  This isn't a thing.  You're not doing this.  And so my wife's like, no, we have to let them fly.  We have to let them go.  And I'm like, no, no, no.  I have to see it for myself.  And she's like, that can't be done.  I said, it can be done.  I will follow them.  And my wife's like, no, you're not going to follow them.  She'd be devastated.  She's 12 years old.  She'd be devastated.  to find out her father followed her to the store.  And I'm like, listen.  And she's like, but you do have to go and pick up pizza and it's right there.  So why don't you go do that?  And I was like, okay.  Cool, baby, I'm liking it, so you want me to follow her?  And my wife's like, no, you can never, she could never find out.  you followed her.  She would be devastated, she would hate us if you followed her.  That's a terrible idea, do not do that.  But yes, you do need to go get the pizza, and so, and I'm like, okay, cool, so I'll follow her, and she's like, Mark, I'm telling you, you cannot follow her.  I'm like, what?  I'm like, okay, so just blink twice, If you don't, and she's like, Mark, you shall not follow her.  I'm like, I don't know what's going on.  So I just followed her to the store, man.  It was a 30-minute venture.  I just like watched her and her friends.  I was like the guy in the van with the big bubble window.  And I just, and I just like sat at a pizza joint across the road.  They were going to the drug store and I just watched them from the pizza place.  And the guy's like, here's your pizza, sir.  I'm like, yeah, whatever.  Just sit down, sit down.  I just, I'm watching something, right?  I'm an evidential thinker.  And so I explained all this evidence for the resurrection of Jesus.  The fact that, you know, the Discovery Channel, definition that Jesus just swooned, he didn't really die on the cross is silly and every historian laughs at it because the one thing the Roman Empire knew how to do was kill people.  They didn't intend to put guys up on crosses.  And they go, oh, just take them down, Jim.  And you just like sit over here for a couple hours and they go, whew, I was close.  And then run away and, you know, I am risen.  I am risen indeed.  Like that doesn't really happen historically.  Now we can go through all of those evidences and they're all legit.  And you can believe all that stuff in your mind.  You can be an evidential thinker.  You can really reasonably, rationally believe in all of this.  But here's the reality.  If you don't love it and cherish it and treasure it, More than anything else, it doesn't save you.  Here's how I know.  Satan knows all those things.  Satan knows Jesus Christ died on a cross.  Satan knows the early church rose, that guys didn't swoon, that it rose and they died.  He knows that Jesus actually rose from the dead as a historical fact, and it does not become salvific for him.  He does not treasure it.  He does not cherish it above everything else in the universe.  And there are some among us that are in the same boat.  And once we begin to understand the beauty of the gospel and what God has done in the context of community, that sends us out, we'll die for it.  Because if that's true, I'll give anything for it. ",
