            "text": "Well hey there, Mike Norton here.  I thought today I would do something fun and a little different here.  At least it's fun for me, maybe not for you because you're going to be watching me eat an Impossible Burger.  I am doing an official taste test today with, I've never tried this before, an Impossible Burger from Burger King.  There's no beef in it.  Where's the beef?  The beef is right here in the regular Whopper.  So I have a regular Whopper and an impossible Whopper with no beef.  We're gonna try both of them and see which one tastes better.  So I'm gonna try the regular Whopper first.  This has everything on it, your classic Whopper, as you can see there.  Ooh, and let's get, oh, hey, I got my Savannah shirt on, huh?  Woo hoo, go Savannah.  All right, here we go.  So regular Whopper, of course we all know what this tastes like.  I'm gonna cleanse the palate of Dr.  Pepper.  And now for the impossible Whopper.  There is no actual meat.  in this.  Well, first of all, it already looks better than the Whopper, but essentially they're identical.  See, huh?  You got, ooh, eh, all sorts of good stuff in there.  So, here we go.  Mmm.  Mmm.  The taste is slightly different.  And I gotta admit, it's actually better.  The Impossible Burger actually tastes better than the Whopper with me.  I mean, I don't know if it's the.  I don't know if it's a lack of animal cruelty that makes this taste better, or if it legitimately tastes better, but it definitely tastes better.  The Impossible Burger tastes better than a regular Whopper.  It's official.  All right.  I'm going to say 100% Of Mike Norton's... Well, actually, there's a couple of them that might not.  100% of new name Noah's agree.  The Impossible Burger is actually better than a regular hamburger.  Thanks for coming, and go to Burger King.  Get yourself an Impossible Burger.  Enjoy it.  And tell them new name.  Noah sent you.  So, you have yourselves a good day.  I'm going to finish eating... eaten this hamburger, and then I'm gonna have a second hamburger, Whopper.  So thanks for coming.  But wait!  There's more!  I wanted to give a little friendly reminder about this.  I am, in fact, still doing the fundraiser for Zelf on the Shelf to get them $5,000.  Now, we are approximately 61% of our goal.  We're over 3,000.  We've got less than $2,000 to go.  I'm trying to get another, like, just under $2,000.  So if you haven't chipped in already, please consider doing so.  If you have chipped in, consider doing so again.  We will raise $5,000 and... It's for a good cause.  Zilph on the Shelf, if you're unfamiliar with them, check them out.  They're fantastic.  Wildly talented.  Samantha, somewhat recently, released a song.  It's on iTunes and Spotify and all that.  It's spectacular.  Maybe I can give you a little, just a little hint of it here or something or another.  Just a little snippet.  Here, think about it.  Here's a little tiny snippet of Samantha Shelley's song.  I forget the name of it.  That's all there is.  I don't know.  It's fantastic, though.  I know.  It's a great song.  I bought it.  It's 99 cents on iTunes, for God's sakes.  Check it out.  Here it is.  And dance when you're broken open.  Dance when you've torn the bandage off.  And for the fundraiser for Zelf on the Shelf, go to tinyurl.com.  slash z-o-t-s fundraiser.  that's zotz fundraiser for zilf on the shelf.  so tinyurl.com slash zotz fundraiser.  here here's a little link to it.  well you can have to type it in.  this isn't a clickable link but ding ding ding right there.  Type that into your browser and go to the fundraiser and chip in a few bucks.  $5, $10, it all adds up.  You know, it takes a village.  And you're part of that village.
