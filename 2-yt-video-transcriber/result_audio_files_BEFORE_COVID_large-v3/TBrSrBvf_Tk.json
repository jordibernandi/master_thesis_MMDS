And he begins to see, so to speak, the writing on the wall.  And he gets the feeling that it's time to hide away the Ark.  And so what does he do?  For one last time, there is a big national celebration of the Passover holiday.  And so now we're reading from 2 Chronicles, chapter 35, verse 3, where Josiah says to the Levites who are consecrated to the Lord who taught all of Israel, put the holy ark in the house that Solomon, son of David, king of Israel, built.  as you no longer carry it on your shoulders.  See now to the service of the Lord your God and his people Israel.  So seemingly, Josiah is telling the Levites, that's it.
