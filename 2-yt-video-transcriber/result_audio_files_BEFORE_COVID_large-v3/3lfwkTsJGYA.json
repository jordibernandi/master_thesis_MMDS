No one knows who that is.  This is a stupid story.  Then the palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways.  We were so afraid we wouldn't be able to interview Kate and Will.  that also quashed the story.  And then Alan Dershowitz was also implicated in it because of the planes.  She told me everything.  She had pictures.  She had everything.  She was in hiding for 12 years.  We convinced her to come out.  We convinced her to talk to us.  It was unbelievable what we had.  Clinton.  We had everything.  I tried for three years to get it on to no avail, and now it's all coming out, and it's like these new revelations, and I freaking had all of it.  I'm so pissed right now.  Every day I get more and more pissed because I'm just like, oh, my God.  What we had was unreal.  Other women backing it up, hey, yep.  Brad Edwards, the attorney, three years ago, saying, like, there will come a day when we will realize Jeffrey Epstein was the most prolific pedophile this country has ever known.
