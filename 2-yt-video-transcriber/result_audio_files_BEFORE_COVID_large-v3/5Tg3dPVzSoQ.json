            "text": "Hi guys, it's Pastor Steve here.  I thought that I'll give you a quick update on what's happening.  For the first time in history, it looks like the prophecy in Daniel chapter 8 is now possible to be fulfilled within not just our lifetime, within any day now.  So what's happening in the Middle East is quite contrary to what I heard.  prophecy people were saying, just even a few days and a few weeks ago, they were expecting World War III.  Nothing of the sort is happening and that's why I've kind of kept back.  I am going to put up an update really soon that's more detailed with scriptures and pictures and all that.  Just for now, just to let you know that I'm on top of prophecy watching and I'm praying.  And Daniel 8 is the next thing.  It's not Ezekiel 38 yet.  It is Daniel 8, which is the war between the Hikot and the Ram.  The Ram is Iran.  The Hikot is Turkey.  And how is that going to happen?  I've been waiting for it.  It's in my book, The Divine Code, for many years.  And it's now coming to pass.  They're going to vie for power.  They're going to fight to be the top Islamic country.  It's either Sunni Turkey or Shia Iran.  One of them wants to dominate.  And the Bible says that Iran actually wins for a while.  Iran is going to be able to push west and north and south.  And they will be able to conquer for a little while.  But then Turkey will come and push back.  So this is Daniel chapter 8.  The angel told Daniel that this is for the end time.  It was not historical.  And how is it going to happen?  Well, Donald Trump has actually made a masterful move to get Iran to back down, to stop fighting and killing Americans.  And they know that he's serious.  They know that he will kill their leaders.  He just killed their second in command, their top general.  So they know he means business and they're not going to mess with him.  But it also has given an opportunity for Iraq to say goodbye America.  They've had enough of America and really America should have enough of Iraq.  It's yielded no fruit for Americans to lose their lives in Iraq.  It's yielded no oil.  America is now oil independent.  Congratulations.  That's what Donald Trump has been able to do.  You're all oil independent.  So you don't need to be there.  You're not going to make, you know, I think I heard Tucker Carlson say, you're not going to make Iraq into Belgium.  It's never going to happen.  And this region is very unstable.  It's Ishmael fighting with his own brothers.  It says that he's going to be a wild donkey of a man, the prophecy in Genesis says.  And his hand will be against everybody and everybody's hand will be against him.  And just like in the Bible times when, you know, the Moabites turn on each other or turn on the other Ammonites and all the otherites.  People like to joke, all the other parasites, well, they've been fighting each other like that for years, and it's long before America.  You're not going to fix it.  It's not your job.  Focus on America.  Make America great again.  And it is going to leave a power vacuum, but... Let them fight it out for themselves.  Turkey is going to end up fighting Iran.  Iran will fight Turkey.  The other Sunni states are going to have an interest in making sure that the Sunni powers win.  So they're going to accept, they already kind of accept Turkey's leadership.  This is why Libya has recently asked Turkey to come and intercede or intervene militarily.  So look, I've never seen a scenario where Daniel chapter 8 could be at our doorstep.  And it's happening in 2020.  I've mentioned that in many videos.  I've mentioned that in the Divine Code books.  Again, check it out in Amazon if you haven't gotten that yet.  It's all there.  It's in Chapter 20.  It's also in Chapter 2, Dreams.  And you can look up in the index.  I've got all the countries listed in the index that you can just go through one by one.  A lot of that material is more than 10 years old that I put there.  The books are 10th anniversary printing.  And it's coming to pass.  I mean, I'm excited.  I'm not excited for war, but I'm excited that there is a peace.  For Americans, Americans can go home.  You have tried your best to turn Iraq into a democracy, and it's not going to happen.  So go home, rest, let the soldiers come home, and this is why Trump is there.  He's there because he's going to end the endless wars.  So that's a part of justice, part of peace for Americans.  So actually, I want to say congratulations to Trump.  Congratulations to America.  You've averted World War III.  And the next war is Daniel chapter 8.  So it looks like it's going to happen in 2020.  I'll keep you posted.  I'll keep you updated.  This is a real quick word.  There will be a follow-up coming up soon.  Again, I appreciate you very much.  I'm traveling and ministering to different churches, and I appreciate your prayers.  I appreciate your support.  And I'm trying to take care of my mission here, God's mission for me in Australia and in Australia.  the Asian Pacific region.  We're fine.  People ask me about the fires.  I'll mention the fires in my next update, okay?  But let me keep this short.  I'll see you in the next video.  Thank you for your support, your prayers.  God bless. ",
