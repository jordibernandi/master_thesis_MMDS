            "text": "I'm dead.  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  Greetings.  Because it's the afternoon in Wolof.  I'm here.  I'm going to come a bit closer because I've been told about my volume.  Of course, I think I just quit the church.  No, I haven't.  All right.  I'm going to come a bit closer because I want to make sure that you can hear me loud and clear.  And we haven't got mics, we don't have lights.  In fact, we don't have real editing equipment yet.  We're working on that.  So, you know, just bear with us and give us some time.  So I just want to say greetings to our Blacksit family.  The reason why I say Blacksit families is because Blacksit isn't just about me or my family.  It's about everybody in the diaspora, everybody that wants to come home.  And Blacksit is also for my African brothers and sisters here because, you know, they welcome us here with open arms.  And, you know, your welcome here is the most amazing thing that I've experienced.  And that's been happening for a long time.  And every time I come here, I feel the same warmth and the same love.  But why am I here today?  What am I talking about on today's vlog?  I keep saying videos but I've been educated by my daughter that it's a vlog.  So what am I talking about today on Black Sea Vlog?  I want to talk about somebody else actually.  Someone who started us on this journey of the vlog.  And his name is Wodamaya.  I was actually on the phone yesterday.  Hang on, let's have a show you.  And I saw 250,000 subscribers for Wodamaya.  Now, I was once told when I was kind of learning about social media that, you know, only one-tenth of the people that watch you actually subscribe.  Now, okay, so my maths is not that great.  so does that mean really that if one tip for the subscribers which is quarter of a million two hundred and fifty thousand watching word of maya does that mean that there are millions of us literally millions of us they're not going to do the maths is watching him worldwide.  so that means so many people are seeing the other side to the world and in particular Africa.  When I first started watching Roda Mai was actually when he was in China and it was his first video that I watched which I think 2.6 million other people watched as well and that was his translation in the supermarket and it showed really the way in which we were viewed by people in China and I thought that was a really insightful and interesting video so I shared it.  So Anyway, I really wanted to say thank you to Wodermeyer because he actually, you know, puts his money where his mouth is and also his time.  And he came and he stayed with me because I'm a bit old school.  So I'm not up to shape with all the vlogs and, you know, all the stuff and how to get around this.  And he really encouraged us to start this journey of documenting and sharing via social media our experiences here in Africa.  So I really want to show my first interview with him, but I just wanted to say that And also to Elvis and to Peace, you're living legends.  You are living legends and we really, really appreciate you.  Right now at the moment, my brother Seth is doing the camera work and he's yawning and his head's ducking and diving, so he's not very inspiring.  But I'm working with you, I'm working with you.  So if you see why I'm laughing behind, it's because you can't see what's happening behind the camera.  But anyway, listen, this is how it goes.  This is like the natural expression of what's going on here, really.  This is the reality.  And just also, before we start playing his video, I really want to say thank you to each and every one of you for your support.  I read your comments, I try to like and love them.  And also to interact with you and talk with you.  So I want to share my email address because a lot of people have asked me for it.  And that is BOP Collective.  So that's Black Operation Positive.  That's B-O-P.  B-O-P Collective.  C-O-L-L-E-C-T-I-V-E.  at yahoo, Y-A-H-O-O dot com.  And so I'll say that again.  That's botcollective at yahoo.com.  That's my email address.  And this is the best way to reach me.  Also, like I said, we are savings through equipment.  So if you want to help, you know, I'm going to still be looking for them.  But if you want to help us, then, you know, you can also uh make a donation or do nation as we call it um to um paypal via bop collective.  so that's really you know what i wanted to say because a lot of people have complained about volume sounds and that kind of thing.  so we're working on it.  just to let you know we're working on it.  so I'm going to link to the video about Wodamaya the living legend with his team and I want them to keep on doing what they're doing because I watch every video and I love to see places in Africa that I've never seen before like Tanzania and I've never been to Kenya and Nigeria.  so there's lots for us to see and I want him to continue his journey.  so I want you to keep supporting Wodamaya You know, send him donations and, you know, send him money via PayPal too.  He's got his own address, which I'm going to try and put in the titles at the end of this video.  So, like I said, keep supporting us and please keep sharing this video.  Share it with your friends and family too.  And like I said, the next video after this one, I really want to show some of the services in daily life.  um while we live here so you can actually see what we do and how we do ordinary things here.  so you know whilst we're here because people want to see us doing ordinary things.  that's what i've been asked about and also the cost of living.  so i'm going to do a video about the cost of living and ordinary life.  so um enjoy rhoda maya and thank you rhoda maya and thank you black sit viewers.

Maybe I have to do an episode about being the village boy.  I have to show people where I used to live before so that they can really relate to some of the things that I do sometimes.  People are like, no, why are you so crazy?  No, the village life is still in me, you know.  Sometimes I need to bring it out. ",

Okay, so one of the things that we know about you is that you've traveled all around the continent and you've brought us some really brilliant footage about China and given us also an insight into China, but not just China, but also how many of us Africans and diasporians, how we survived there.  And one of the things that I was absolutely impressed by was your ability to learn and speak the language.  Now, For other people who are wishing to obviously travel abroad, like for us being here in Africa and trying to learn Wolof here in Gambia, you know, how did you learn the language so quickly and what are some tips you can give us?

You know, my first time in China and I got lost and it was my first time experiencing winter.  So, you know, like I went through a lot.  So I went through a lot because I couldn't speak the language.  You get it?  So I decided to learn the language so that things would be easy for me to move around China.  So what I did was like, you know, finding the locals.  So I actually learned Chinese with the locals, not even in classrooms. ",

If you go to Senegal, they speak Wolof.  All you need to do is to find the locals, be their friends, and start learning from them.  Make sure you don't speak English with them.  Make sure you try to imitate whatever they say.  And trust me, within three months, you'll be able to express yourself, because that's what I did.  In three months, I won my first award.

Ghana is peaceful.  Ghana, Ghanaians are friendly.  We got the best food in the entire world.  You know, you got to try our food, our Jollof, the best Jollof in the entire West Africa, even though they're trying to compete.  But they know that Ghana Jollof has no competition.  What else should I tell you?  You know, Ghana has a lot of history in connection to the slavery.  So if you are looking for what to trace your ancestors, maybe you can start from Ghana.  And then what else again should I say about Ghana?  Ghanaian culture, because one of the beautiful cultures in the entire world.
