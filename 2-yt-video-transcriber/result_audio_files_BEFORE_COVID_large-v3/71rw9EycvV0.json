And you know, these people that are calling myself racist and Don Cherry racist, at least have something racist said before you get to lose your career and your legendary status because of something that they think that he was going to say.  And I'll tell you why.  I know that that's not what he meant, because I talked to him the night before about this very subject, and I wrote a column in Saturday's paper, and he said all of that to me in a very, very clear and cogent way.
