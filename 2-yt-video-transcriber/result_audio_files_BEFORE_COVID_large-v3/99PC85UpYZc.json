            "text": "Captain Bob Walters of Water Wolf Charters based out of Clayton has been guiding muskie fishing charters on the St.  Lawrence River for 30 years.  He believes the next world record.  muskie is swimming in the river right now and in fact claims to have taken a video of it last summer.  Walters biggest muskie to date is a 59 incher caught by one of his clients back in 2010.  He estimates the one he captured on film last year to be an eye-opening 70 inches.  Now, muskies are elusive.  They're known as the fish of 10,000 casts because they're so difficult to catch.  Walter's charters last up to eight hours, and it's not unusual to come back empty-handed.  That's muskie fishing.  To help pass the time, since the 1990s, Walter's has attached video cameras to a couple of his downriggers that show the lures being trolled behind the boat.  Both Walter's and his clients are constantly watching for some action.  As an extra service to his clients, Walters can send them home with a video of the big one that got away.  The following is a video taken last fall aboard Walter's boat of a 46-inch muskie landed by Bob Gorman of Syracuse.  Watch as the fish twice follows and misses the 13-inch Believer lure.  It then switches attention to another lure being trolled and hit that instead.  Muskies have to be at least 54 inches to keep on the St.  Lawrence River and this fish was released immediately after the picture was taken.  The second video taken by one of Walter's cameras captures in slow motion a much bigger muskie going after one of Walter's lures.  Keep in mind the length of the rig from the tip of the Believer lure back to the end of the tractor lure which is attached to a leader is 54 inches, Walter said.  The current world record for muskie is held by Cal Johnson of Wisconsin.  That fish caught in 1949 measured 60 1\u20444 inches and weighed 67 pounds 8 ounces.  Is the one recorded on Walter's video camera much bigger than that?  That's for the viewer to decide.  Walter, shown here again with his 59-incher, is convinced that it is, and that someday the next world record muskie will be caught in the St.  Lawrence River.  His motto is, Muskies, everything else is just bait. ",
