            "text": "What we try to do with Wall Builders Collection is present America's forgotten history and heroes.  One of our forgotten heroes is the guy who wrote this letter.  His name is Hiram Rhodes Revels.  That's usually not a name that we think of immediately, but we should.  He is one of the original black congressmen.  This is Hiram Rhodes Revels right there.  He's the first black U.S.  senator.  Now, the story of how he became a senator is interesting, but before we get there, Hiram Rhodes Revels was a gospel minister.  He was with the black denomination, AME denomination.  He was also with the Methodist Episcopal denomination.  He also raised two regiments of black soldiers in the Civil War, one regiment out of Missouri, one regiment out of Maryland.  He ran a Christian newspaper, very strong Christian man, but he was elected to the legislature of Mississippi in about 1868, 1870.  But he became a U.S.  Senator in an interesting manner.  This man is named John Roy Lynch.  He's one of the early black congressmen that served.  He also was in the Mississippi legislature.  He also was a Republican.  And he said what made Hiram Rhodes Revel a U.S.  Senator, our first U.S.  Senator, was that he was asked to open the Mississippi legislature with prayer.  He did.  And he said the prayer was so good that they elected him to the U.S.  Senate.  I wonder what the Senate would look like today if we chose our U.S.  Senators based on how they prayed. ",
