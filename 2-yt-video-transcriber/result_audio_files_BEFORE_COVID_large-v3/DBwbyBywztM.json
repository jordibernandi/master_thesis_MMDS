            "text": "This is Terry Swoop of Swoop's Entertainment Vids and this is my top 10 video of the best looking jerry curls of the 1980s.  Now I was born and raised in the 1980s but I never actually had a jerry curl.  I was just a little kid in the 80s and my mother never allowed me to wear a jerry curl.  She thought it was too much management.  But I always liked the way jerry curls looked.  Whether it be a man or a woman, they always looked nice and presentable.  Now jerry curls started to go out of style towards the late 80s.  early 90s and everybody started wearing the high top fades and getting cornrows and that became the style towards the 90s.  but hopefully they may come back in style later on in the century.  we never know.
