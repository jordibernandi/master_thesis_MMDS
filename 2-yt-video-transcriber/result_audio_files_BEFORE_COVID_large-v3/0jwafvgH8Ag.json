            "text": "okay.  so we have these things.  this is like my stump hello hello.  today we're doing something fun.  uh i'm here with my friend alexis from stump kitchen hello yay.  and if you haven't ever seen stump kitchen before can you tell them what you do on your channel?  absolutely so.  i make gluten-free and vegan recipes and i use my stump as a kitchen tool so like a lemon juicer potato masher spatula, and many, many more.  So it's a very good time.  I love her channel.  Please, I'm going to link it in the description so that you all can go follow her.  I'm so excited because we are both together for Clexacon, which is a convention conference about LGBT representation in the media.  So we've been having a great time hanging out with a bunch of our LGBT plus pals, community, and talking about LGBT representation and culture and our intersection of identifying as both queer and disabled.  It's so great.  So for this video, What we wanted to try and do is I have to actually get ready for another panel.  that I'm doing.  You're on three.  You're on three panels.  Me, one, you, three.  Now, and you know what?  We have a really good urgency moment because there's a time crunch.  I've got to get out of here in a certain amount of time.  Urgency.  Alexa's going to try to help me do my makeup.  Okay.  With one hand.  Yes.  Okay, so I'm going to pretend that I know how to do this.  I don't, but we're going to have fun.  Thank you for trusting me.  That's a big deal.  Yeah, you don't.  usually, I'm just going to say now, you don't really wear makeup?  No.  Or is it a never?  It's not a never.  Like, sometimes if I'm feeling fancy, I'll put on mascara.  But I don't wear makeup otherwise.  So... This obviously covers up things that you don't want other people to see.  So, like, your baggage, your, like, hard memories, you know, your past traumas and shit.  Oh, my God, how accurate.  Yeah, but I don't know.  You want me to tell you?  Yeah.  It's very accurate because the only way that I use that is kind of, like, highlight.  So I use that, like, under my eye circles.  Okay.  So I was wrong and correct.  Yeah, because it's for my traumas and bad memories.  Oh, neat.  Am I pushing too hard?  No.  wow that like the magic changes things.  mm-hmm I'm sorry no I have nervous eyes but like half the makeup on the table right now is eye makeup.  so that's really funny.  okay yeah good I think that's enough that's good.  okay great.  what's next?  yay like.  as you can see like one is the main used one.  we should have figured that out.  This one is the one you like to use.  Is it like a face massage?  I was going to say the exact same thing.  It's like a face massage.  Actually, it makes it so smooth.  Say that again.  Try to sing me a song, Annie.  Fun time.  This makeup is going to be shit, but we're having the time.  That's all that matters.  Now, next, if I was making a choice, I would do something on your eyes.  Okay.  But I don't know what.  Maybe... Oh, look.  We do have this if you want to try, but also there's no tools for this.  So I'll use my fingers.  Yeah.  Great.  The makeup gurus hate us right now.  I'm going to do one eye with my finger and one eye with my finger.  Nice.  I can't believe you're agreeing.  Absolutely.  What color?  Whatever you want.  Whatever I want.  Okay, what's going to go good with yellow?  Oh, maybe, like, some of these blue situations.  Do you think so?  I do think so.  Yeah, I never, like, I barely ever use eyeshadow.  I have it, like, in case of emergencies.  What would make up an eyeshadow emergency?  If I had to go to a club or something, like, like that, then I need, like, bolder makeup.  I understand.  Now I get it.  Okay.  All right.  Close your eyes and trust me.  I'm doing double-handed or double-limbed, I guess, eyeshadow.  Okay.  And I'm not allowed to help one with the other.  All right.  So let's get some more over here.  You know what?  I've always really liked, of the eyeshadow that I've ever done, either on myself or others, I've always really liked using my hands just because I feel like You almost have more control, and it's like, I don't know.  Well, also, because... Us broke fellas don't have enough money for, like, 25 brushes.  Absolutely, right?  Your eyelashes are so long.  Aw, thank you.  Look at them.  They're like a pony.  You know how ponies have such long eyelashes?  Aw.  Yeah.  That's really sweet.  Because, like, I don't know because of anxiety or dehydration, I, like, rub my eyes so much that I've gotten rid of quite a few sections of my eyelashes.  Really?  So I've had to try to grow them back out, yeah.  Well, it looks like you're doing a great job.  Thank you.  They're very full and they kind of fan out like ponies.  Aw, thank you.  All right.  Okay, now I would do, I don't know, this thing?  Okay.  Do you wear this?  Yes.  Okay, great.  I took away everything that's, like, I even put the eyeshadow on the other side, but I was like, if you want, give it a try.  Give it a shot.  Yeah, because I usually just use that for, like, places.  That's very good.  Eyeshadow emergency.  Oh, so pretty.  Okay, now this side's going to be a little weird.  Okay.  Because it's, like, reverse.  Oh, God.  Okay, open.  Okay.  I'm going to come in like this.  Okay.  I'm just going to steady myself.  Yes.  See, they're so long, I don't even have to go near your eyes.  Because they're just like... It's good to make sounds when you do makeup.  I learned that from myself.  So what's your next video that's going to come out?  The next video is probably how to book and prepare... For traveling while disabled.  Yeah, I bet you there'd be so many, like, well, there are, like, even thinking about, okay, so on my flight here to Vegas, I was sat in the emergency exit row.  Mm-hmm.  And I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and I hid my arm the entire time because I've had friends who have been asked to like be removed from the row because they think that they can't handle the door and all these things.  Or, you know, friends with like prosthetic legs or whatever.  And it's like, you know like we we know the limits of our body.  we can have a conversation.  you don't need to make those choices for us.  um so that's like probably my main one of my one of my things when i'm traveling just like if i'm in that row it's like yes i can sit here don't make assumptions right?  you know.  yeah it's gonna be different for like every disability.  so absolutely i never know like how to use the language like outside of like because i identify as disabled.  so i'm like how to prepare for traveling as an EDSer.  I don't know, maybe, but like, but I feel like it's.  a lot of the things are not going to be necessarily specific to my disability, but some things will be.  Yeah.  And some things will be more broad than a lot of folks can kind of like tune into.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of things you'll be able to use whether you're disabled or not.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Like we've talked about a few of the packing techniques that I have.  Okay, so I do not prepare when I pack.  I just shove everything into a bag.  And Annie's like, do you know if you roll stuff, you save room?  I'm like, excuse me?  Or just like packing things on the bottom that you're going to need last versus first on top.  Like, that's just very good.  Very good.  I love it.  I love it.  I always think that those things are common sense, but they are.  Well, they're not.  We need to know.  We need to know the information.  I'm ready.  I'm ready to put it all out there.  Are you ready for lip time?  Sure, yes.  I'm like trying to wipe off because what I did before in preparation is I use this Brujita Holistic Skin Care and it is like an avocado cream.  Oh my gosh, I want to bathe in it.  Yeah, you can.  It's like you put it like, it's like a treatment for your skin face, face skin.  Your skin face?  Yeah.  Your face skin.  Your face skin.  Uh, also you can put it on your lippy.  So I put it there to try and like, cause it's very dry here in Vegas.  Oh, it's so dry.  So I put it there to try and like moisturize before I put any lip color on.  Okay.  That's great.  The more you know.  Exactly.  I have no idea.  And I just want to note that I'm using the elementary school pencil hold for this lipstick, so this is how we're going to do it.  I think this is the correct way.  Not at all.  Okay.  All right.  You have fun lips.  They are so nice and full.  Mwah.  And then this thing goes in the middle of them?  That's a choice.  That's a choice I'm going to make.  Okay, great.  And then the tops are always the hardest.  But the pencil technique helps.  Wonderful.  That's not bad.  Oh, I thought I was going to really mess that up, but I don't think I did.  Yay!  This just, like, looks like too much fun, so I'm just going to put a little dab in the middle just to give it, like, wow, you know?  Okay.  Oh, it's really dark.  Okay.  It's fine.  We made a choice.  You can also blend.  That's true.  Let's see.  You can also blend the dark into the... With this or with... With itself.  Thank you.  You can also blend.  It can also... Yeah, that is a darker color.  It is, but then that's okay.  Oh, that makes you look like a vampire.  Wow.  Okay, I'm going to do this one, and then I'm going to let you do that one.  So we can see the difference, and also you can fix them if I mess them up.  Okay.  All right, so we'll start with this eyebrow.  Even, like, if you're on the actual hair and darkening the hair itself, it's like... Okay, let me see.  Oh, yeah.  A full brow.  A full... Brow.  Everyone.  You can see the difference a little bit.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  But it's just, like, a tiny bit of, like, distinction or whatever.  Right.  The finale is always that, like, I have, like, my hair twisted up, and then when I pull it out, it's, like, wavy.  Yeah.  That's how you do that.  Yeah.  I was wondering.  Okay, so those eyes with that hair look so great because your hair is so dark.  it actually looks blue.  Did you know that?  Yay.  That's the magic.  It's magic.  You look so ready for your panel.  I'm ready for my panel.  You're going to rock it so hard.  Yay.  Oh, yay.  And it's like a little part of me will be there with you.  Aw, yay.  Because she's got other plans.  Well, yes, I'm going to an animal sanctuary to pet the animals.  And then I'm going to cook a vegan dinner because, yeah, that's what I do.  What a cutie.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bueno.  I think.  What time is it now?  I don't know.  Is it time to go?  I don't know.  It's probably.  I should probably.  I should probably.  So we can get out of here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bueno.  Thank you so much for being on my channel.  It was my pleasure.  Being in my video.  This was so great.  And for helping me put this look together that I'm literally not even going to change.  Oh God.  I'm going to go there just like this.  Bless you.  Bless you, friend.  It's really great.  Yeah, thank you for having me.  This was so much fun.  Yay!  I'm so glad.  So good.  I'm so glad.
