            "text": "Yeah, excellent question.  What about those that have never heard?  Now, notice that this question is a moral question.  Okay.  It's impugning or it's questioning.  Puny is the wrong word.  It's questioning God's morality.  Like, why would God not want to save people?  Why didn't he get them the word directly?  Yeah, right.  Okay.  Let's just spend a couple of minutes on this because it's an excellent question.  First of all, Christ's sacrifice is necessary for salvation.  When I was debating Christopher Hitchens a number of years ago, he basically said, well, why would God just show up 2,000 years ago?  What about all the people before him?  And I said, well, Christ's sacrifice, Christopher, applied to people before Christ, even if they didn't know what the sacrifice was.  So it's retroactive, even though it hadn't happened in time yet, that Christ's sacrifice still covered their sins, even if they didn't know.  They may have just known about Yahweh or God, and they trusted in Yahweh for their salvation.  First, everyone knows God exists through nature and conscience.  There's nobody out there who doesn't know that God exists.  They don't know who Jesus is, maybe, but they know that there is a God.  Secondly, some say that those who don't know Jesus can be saved by Christ's sacrifice if they seek God, like the Old Testament saints.  people did not know Jesus's name but they were still saved by a sacrifice.  in fact Paul even says the gospel was preached to Abraham and Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.  he just trusted in Yahweh and he was saved.  not by works as Paul goes to great lengths to point out in Romans chapter 4 but by trusting in Christ or trusting in Yahweh.  okay But it seems to me the more biblically consistent view is that God will get true seekers the truth about Christ so that they can be saved.  You have an example, for example, in Acts chapter 10, Cornelius already is a believer in Yahweh, but he actually is given the gospel so he can be saved.  So it seems like you need to know the name today to be saved.  You say, well, many people don't know the name.  What about that?  Well, it could be that God has so ordered the world that those who never hear the gospel wouldn't have believed it anyway.  That's possible, right?  We know there are a lot of people that do hear the gospel and don't believe it.  But it could be that people who never hear the gospel wouldn't have believed it anyway.  Now, why might that be a possibility?  Well, this passage right here, Paul is talking to the Athenians in Acts 17 on Mars Hill.  And notice he says this, \"...from one man God made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth, and He determined the time set for them and the exact places where they should live.  God did this so that men would seek Him and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of  us.\".  It could be that people who never hear Jesus wouldn't have believed him anyway.  That's possible, right?  Maybe this isn't true.  I'm just saying it's possible.  Which means that God is not morally culpable because he knows they're not going to believe in him anyway.  The bottom line is this, that since God is just, nobody's going to be treated unfairly.  Everybody... uh is going to wind up where they ought to wind up in eternity and i've noticed this in fact.  let me ask you guys a question here and maybe this will help with this answer.  it's not directly related to it but it might help.  this question is for christians only if you're not a christian.  don't answer this question.  it's just for christians only christians.  i want.  i want to ask you in here for just a second to think about somebody you know who's not a christian whom you'd like to be a christian.  does everyone have one?  Anybody got somebody?  Okay, here's my question about the person you're thinking of.  Is the person you're thinking of on a relentless pursuit of truth?  They want to know if Christianity is true or not, or are they apathetic or maybe even hostile?  How many say the person I'm thinking of is on a relentless pursuit of truth?  They want to know if Christianity is true.  I have three and a half hands.  How many say the person I'm thinking of is apathetic or hostile?  Yeah, look around the room.  Just about everybody else.  Now, actually, you guys gave me three people, three and a half people.  Last year, I was in front of an audience of 1,000.  One person raised their hand.  Because I don't know about you, but most people are not on a truth quest.  Most people are on a happiness quest.  And they're just going to believe whatever they think is going to make them happy.  And if they think God's going to get in their way of happiness, so much for God.  Most people aren't seeking God.  And God wants us to be saved more than we want people to be saved.  I mean, that's what he says.  God wants all people to be saved.  Do you think if God wants all people to be saved, all people who want to be saved will be saved?  Yeah.  So I rest in God's justice and love that.  ultimately this is all going to work out.  What I know does save people is the gospel.  That's why we're supposed to risk all to get them the gospel.  Does that make sense? ",

Now, it's a good question that he can give to our worldview.  You're saying that God is a moral being, but he doesn't appear to be moral here.  What about that?  And then you can give an answer like this and say, well, look, I... God wants everyone to be saved.  If some people aren't saved, it's because they don't want to be.  As we just saw here with this little survey, most people aren't seeking God.  We're running from them.  Because we want to do our own thing.  Half the time I want to do that.  Don't you?
