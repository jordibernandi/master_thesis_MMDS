            "text": "And that's a claim that Trump has made a staggering 190 times by the beginning of August, so easily over 200 times by now.  And that's not even counting the amount of times that he promised Mexico would pay for it.  Trump has claimed that Americans weren't feeling any impact from his trade war with China and that the cost of the tariffs falls onto the Chinese, which isn't true.  When the US imposes tariffs on China, the cost of goods being imported is passed onto the American companies, which then pass the increased costs onto consumers.  In other words, we're the ones paying more for everything and then being told not to believe what the increased price tags on our goods is telling us.  Trump just promised that he'll approve a major middle income tax cut if the Republicans win in 2020, which might not seem like a lie until you take into account that Trump pledged to introduce a 10% middle class tax cut just after midterms, and I don't seem to be able to find that tax cut anywhere.  Trump claimed that the Mueller report completely and totally exonerated him.  The report itself literally says that it does not exonerate the president.  Trump has claimed that this is the best economy in American history.  It's not even as strong as Bill Clinton's economy just 20 years ago.  He said that he passed Veterans Choice, even though it was passed by Obama.  He said millions and millions of people voted illegally in the last presidential election, despite his own voter fraud commission finding no such evidence.  This administration called getting disaster relief to Puerto Rico the most logistically challenging event the United States has ever seen, we've literally flown to the moon.  And look, we can go on and on, but the fact is that Trump is objectively the least trustworthy president in American history.  According to the Washington Post, he's told over 12,000 lies after 928 days in office.  And that was as of August 5th.  That information is already obsolete.  At the rate he's gone, he'll have told over 300 more lies just by the time that analysis was released.  All that McEnany's claim does is prove to people that, just like during his first term, Trump will run his re-election under the same pretenses.  If the foundation is built on lies, then his entire presidency will be too.  And that reflects horribly on Trump, sure, but that's also a testament to just how little this administration cares about its own supporters, that it would expect them to believe such an absurd claim.  Say you've told a few lies, but you're committed to the truth from now on.  Say you got ahead of yourself before all the facts came in.  But to say outright that Trump has never told a lie, to tell the biggest lie while defending yourself about lying, is so shameless, so obvious, that it's a slap in the face to those they think they're fooling.  I don't know about Trump supporters, but I couldn't bring myself to support someone who treats me like I'm brain dead, and especially someone who lies every damn chance I get. ",
