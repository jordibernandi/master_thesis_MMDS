            "text": "All right, so today's topic.  I have a story I want to share with you guys.  I just came back from a comedy show, maybe 20 minutes ago here in Montreal.  And during the show, there's a couple that's being very disruptive.  At one point, the guy in the couple gets up on the stage while the comic is performing.  Fuck off.  Dead ass.  He did it to both of them.  He got up on the stage, bro.  Now, if you don't understand, like, imagine you're at a hockey game and some motherfucker just jumps on the ice.  And he's like, oh, what you doing with the ice?  Well, they get thrown out.  Exactly, I've seen people at music concerts, they get up on stage, they get tackled. ",

            "text": "So me, I'm already heated at this point, because I'm looking, I'm like, yo, what the fuck?  This is like a safety issue.  You can't be getting up, because if it's me, I'm punching you.  The show is off to a weird start.  I go up third.  Halfway through my set, the lady, she's talked to the person she's with.  And I hear them.  Because in a comedy show, you can hear people talking.  It's a quiet room.  You're the only one speaking.  Another voice is easily audible.  So I'm like, hey, is something wrong?  And they're like, yeah, we're not happy with our customer service.  I'm like, great.  That's good information.  If you want, you feel free to share it with the staff after the show.  During the show, you can shut the fuck up.  Crowd erupts because they're happy.  someone's telling them to shut the fuck up.  Yeah, of course.  I get that.  I try to move on with the show and the lady starts to go.  Oh my God.  Like I said, it's getting old.  What's getting old?  That shit.  Like I said, bro, this shit's getting old.  What's getting old?  That shit.  What shit?  That shit.  Come on, just say the racist shit you want to say.  I'm not racist at all.  She got her.  I'm racist starter pack going right now.  So she just kept repeating, this shit's getting old.  I'm like, what's getting old?  She's like, this shit's getting old.  And listen, I don't like to say stuff is racist.  I actually hesitate to do it because most of the time the conversation is unproductive because the people who don't get it, unless it's very flagrant, they just think, oh, it's in your head.  So for me, I never have that conversation.  But my intuition in that moment was like, I think she's getting tired of hearing me say anything about black people.  And to be fair, my set has little to do with black people.  I barely talked about race.  But she just didn't want to hear any of it.  So they start to leave for the door.  I'm outside.  And they come up to me and they're like, hey, I'm sorry.  Listen, we're going to leave.  But listen, the comedians, they couldn't handle our shit.  I'm like, yo, get the fuck out of here and go home.  At this point, I'm tired of this shit.  Yeah, of course.  She says, listen, she goes, and how about you go back to your fucking country, you welfare monkey bitch?  You know what I did?  I went... Because you know what the moment was?  Nigga, I knew it was racist.  Yes, of course. ",

I'm like, bro, I have a gut feeling.  Yeah, of course.  And then it happened, and my friends looked at me like, whoa, nigga, you was right.  And I'm like, that is what most racism in life is.  It's a lot of dog whistling.  It's you saying stuff that kind of hints at it, but you don't want to be direct with it.  And oftentimes black people were made to feel crazy about stuff we know is wrong, but it's really flake.  And this girl saying all kinds of foul shit about my mom being a monkey and I'm right on welfare my whole life.  And I should go back.  Keep in mind, I'm born in this country, served in the military, but to her, I need to go back to my country, whatever that means.  And it just, in that moment, I was just so happy.  I was like, bitch, I'm right.  Like, my intuition's still sharp. ",
