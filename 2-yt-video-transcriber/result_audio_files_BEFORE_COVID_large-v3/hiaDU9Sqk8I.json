All right, so the guy, Christopher Cukor, who works at YouTube, now, of course, he called the police, and, of course, you heard his young son there saying, Daddy, don't do it, don't do it.  He's right.  Well, then he later wrote, first of all, he apologizes in his Medium.com post, and he says that the reason he did that is because he had faced a situation where his father had been killed by confronting somebody who was trespassing in his building.  Okay, I get that.  but your dad confronted somebody and you just confronted somebody.  Don't you think it makes sense that if you were really concerned that this person was trespassing, that you would probably stand across the street and call the cops as opposed to actually confronting him, okay?  What ends up happening, the brother who was there, the woman, his friend, she eventually came down.  And so this guy was like, well, you know, we have people who are trespassing in our building.  You know what, that's why you notify building security, or you notify the leasing office or whatever to say, deal with this.  But this is a perfect example, again, Eugene, where we have white folks who are losing their mind in this country, who think that they can question anybody black at any time and challenge us whether we're getting in an elevator, waiting for a friend.

All right, folks, back to that RoboBot unfiltered video in just one moment.  All right, folks, we're back.  MarijuanaStock.org has another great investment opportunity.  If you were lucky enough to invest in their last crowdfunding campaign, you know they raised a lot of money in just a few months investing in legal marijuana farms.  Those initial investors now own shares of a publicly traded company.  Last time again, many of you missed it.  Y'all been sending me emails, but now they have a new investment opportunity that is as good, if not even better, than the last one.  I'm talking about industrial hemp CBD.  For those who don't know, the hemp plant is the cousin to marijuana with a much higher concentration of CBD, which means hemp CBD gives you all the medical benefits of marijuana without getting you high.  Until recently, hemp farming was practically illegal in the U.S.  and heavily regulated by the DEA.  However, the 2018 Farm Bill passed in Congress makes it legal to grow hemp CBD in the  U.S.,  creating one of the largest commodities worldwide.  They need land to grow all of the plants, which makes for an incredible investment opportunity, and that's where our good friends at 420 Real Estate come in.  Their business model is simple.  They buy land that supports hemp CBD grow operations and lease it to licensed, high-paying tenants.  That's right, they are hemp CBD landlords, and you can get in on the action.  You can invest in this crowdfunding campaign for as little as $200 up to $10,000.  Like I said, you don't want to miss out this time, so don't be sending me any emails.  if you do.  To invest, go to MarijuanaStock.org.  That's MarijuanaStock.org.  Get in the game and do it now.  Now back to your Roland Martin unfiltered film. ",
