            "text": "The other day I was cruising down on Facebook and I noticed a meme, our funny image macro.  and you know I saw it and I thought to myself you know I never actually really paid attention to this but there actually is quite the trend especially considering how often it has occurred.  and that trend is A bunch of redhead characters in, like, comic books, or not even just comic books, but just, like, in fictional media in general, are oftentimes being replaced with black people.  I honestly sat there and I thought to myself, why are all of these genders being replaced by niggers?  No, I'm kidding.  I'm not joking.  See, I can actually say that word because I'm black, but you white people can't.  Okay, but to be serious though, and it's actually not really even a joke at this point, it's legitimately something, it's a legitimate trend that is occurring constantly.  That trend is, gender characters are being replaced by black characters.  Now, I'm oftentimes the person who loves to critically analyze things and try to figure out why.  And honestly... I can't tell you why.  I've been thinking about this for a couple of days and I really don't know why genders are being replaced by black people.  I don't get I don't understand why that is a thing.  So if you want some answer.  I'm sorry, I just don't really have it for you.  But the more I thought about it, the more offended, I guess I say offended, but the more befuddled and confused and kind of agitated and aggravated I've been getting with all of these.  Hollywood decisions to bring more black people up to the forefront, or at least their method of doing so, has just kind of left me agitated.  Dumbstruck.  For example, this is actually a really good example, I feel.  So there's this whole kerfuffle about The Little Mermaid.  Disney is remaking The Little Mermaid, I think it'll probably come out maybe a year, no, probably in about a year and a half, if not two years, right?  It's coming out after Mulan.  And that should be talked about by itself, but whatever.  So, The character, Ariel, is being replaced by this black lady here.  I don't know her name.  It's not really important, at least for now.  But I was sitting here and I saw the firestorm.  I saw the videos.  I saw people complaining about it.  But no one actually kind of touched on what I feel to be one of the most important questions or conversations to ask when it comes about this change in particular.  Everyone was like, you had some people on one hand who were like, no, The Little Mermaid is a Danish story.  So a little mermaid should be a white redhead or at least someone of some Danish or white European descent.  And you had other people on the other side who were like, yeah, but think of all the representation.  Look at the fact that we've got more black characters for these young black women to look up to.  And these people need to see themselves in the media they watch.  And all that good stuff.  And I was sitting here thinking to myself, yeah, okay, but why a little mermaid?  Why Ariel?  Like, for the one whole accuracy thing, you know what?  I'm going to leave that neither here nor there.  But when it comes to, like, anyone being proud that Ariel... Of all characters in the Disney franchise is being replaced by... Why would anyone be proud of Ariel?  Like, did you guys see The Little Mermaid?  Did you watch that movie?  Ariel is by far one of the worst protagonists of any story I've ever seen, ever.  Like, what interesting themes are brought upon in The Little Mermaid?  Give up your whole family in the pursuit of dick.  That's what I get.  You can mess everything up and still get what you want because your daddy is the king.  He just gives you what you want.  You don't have to work for it.  You just get it.  You don't actually have to try.  What lessons did Ariel learn?  Did Ariel become a better person?  Let's actually take into consideration that Ariel was a 16-year-old girl, a teenager.  Her whole life is now in the hands of this man that she just met, that she saw on a boat a couple of days ago.  I'm supposed to be happy that this occurred?  Why do I care?  What does this mean anything to me?  What does a Little Mermaid as a story convention or as a character portray or mean to me or anybody?  How does anyone relate to that?  So I'm sitting here and I see Ariel being as terrible as she is as a protagonist and as a story.  And I think to myself, why would anyone, like anyone, any black person be happy that this is the character we're giving?  Now, I'm not saying that Ariel, like, we're getting the worst protagonist as a bite against black people.  I'm not saying that at all.  I don't think that's really the case.  But what I am saying is that... If you actually look at the character, you'll notice that her race is not important to the themes and the quality of it.  And that's what I think is the most important thing that should be discussed or thought about when we talk about these fictional characters.  The themes, the stories, who they are, what do they represent, what's trying to be imparted or told to us.  Are they a good character or are they a bad character?  And honestly, the whole racial changing thing oftentimes seems, at least to me, to be done all for the whole idea of representation.  Now, I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I don't understand the power or how cool or vindicating representation is.  For example, when I was younger... I've never seen, even correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never seen any character that even looked remotely similar to me, honestly.  They had a nice, cool afro, went on mystical, fantastical adventures, you fought monsters and gained superpowers.  I've never seen any character that was designed in any similar fashion to someone that looked like me.  So I made one.  So I made them.  That was a huge, when I wrote, I wrote, no, four books now.  When I wrote that book series, a huge portion of that was creating a character who looked similar to me, like doing all these cool adventures because I've never seen one who was like me.  So I understand like representation and wanting to project yourself into these cool mystical environments and areas and like have fun spinning off into that, right?  I get it.  I'm not saying that representation isn't even a necessary or unnecessary thing.  But what I am saying is that there should be something more from representation than simply just having the same skin color, basically.  You know what I mean?  For example, let's take... Like in Supergirl, right?  In Supergirl, you had Jimmy Olsen was replaced by this tall, handsome black man.  Now, in the comic books, Jimmy Olsen was kind of a... scrawny, nerdy redhead, right?  I think it was the photographer, I think, for the Daily Planet.  But he wasn't the suave guy that we get in the Supergirl TV show.  I've only seen a couple episodes of Supergirl, but he's a pretty fucking swell guy.  He's pretty cool.  And it's just, I was looking at this, right, and it just kind of befuddled me at the fact that they made this change.  Now, perhaps part of it is some kind of bulldog fantasy where we have the blonde, beautiful white woman with this big, hulking black guy, and people just love that.  I personally don't really get that shit too much, but it does seem to be kind of a thing.  There was even this whole sitcom, I think on, what was it, Nickelodeon or something, or maybe Disney Channel, I called some girl in the Bulldogs.  It was kind of like that.  It was kind of whack, honestly.  Maybe that's what it was.  Maybe some Hollywood executive or someone up there writing the show just wanted to put that fetish there.  Maybe.  I don't know.  But the whole point is the aesthetic changes like that changes the character completely, right?  And it's never addressed.  At least, you know, here's the thing, actually.  Maybe I'll complete the thought and then maybe I'll defend the show, right?  Because my thought here is that the moment you make a character black, The way the world reacts to them is different.  Good or bad, wrong or right, that's just the reality of the situation.  The moment a character is black, the world's not going to think, they're not going to react to him or her the same way they're going to react to a character that's white.  It's just different fundamentally.  Even if you took these same characters and you put them in the same environment, if you're going to make a reasonable reaction, world that reflects reality are supposed to be realistic.  when someone meets a black person they're gonna feel and think differently than when they meet a white person.  As far as I know, there is no change.  There is no reflection of that obvious truth in the world.  Being a tall black guy, you're going to scare small white women sometimes.  That's just going to happen.  If you're walking down the street, it's just going to occur.  It's got nothing to do with you.  It's got everything to do with other people, other media stereotypes.  But that's a thing.  It's going to happen.  Too bad, so sad.  I have accepted it.  You guys have accepted it.  Anyone who wants to argue against me, you're just wrong.  It's like arguing that your body doesn't need to drink water in order to survive.  You can do that, and you can fucking die when you refuse to drink water.  See you later.  But the truth of the matter is, being a black person is a different experience than being a white person.  If you're going to tell a story where you change the character and you make them black, there should be some reason for it.  And you know what?  I'm not going to go as far as to say that no story does this.  I'm not going to go as far as to say that no.  And this is mostly just from my ignorance.  It's entirely possible that they do or they don't.  But from a lot of these comic book changes, like for example, let's take Michelle Jones or MJ in the new Spider-Man movie, right?  who's supposed to be a replacement for Mary Jane, right?  What difference does it make that she's a mixed woman?  Exactly.  It makes no difference.  So why even do it?  And from what I can gather, it's just for representation.  It's just so.  other mixed girls are like, oh, hey, there's Michelle Jones, MJ.  She looks like me.  I'm vindicated now.  But what does that do for the character?  How does it change her perspective on life?  Some mixed people that I've talked to have a totally different view.  Now, some of them, they're just like, whatever.  Life is what it is.  They don't really think too much about the fact that they're mixed.  But some mixed people are incredibly insecure about the fact that they feel torn between being a black person or being a white person or being a Mexican and being Japanese.  Those are all character traits that could be expressed in that character but are never touched upon because what was important was not the actual character's experience and thoughts and stories, but what was important was simply representation.  Hey, I'm black, you're black.  I'm mix, you're mix.  You're Mexican, I'm Mexican.  Oh, I see you.  But again, that changes everything.  For example, let's say I take... Let's say I like Isekai stories, right?  For those of you who don't know, Isekai just basically means another world.  It's basically when a character, usually, not always, sometimes they'll die or they get transported to another world for some mission or something.  Digimon actually is a really good example of an Isekai show that's really popular, where the characters are transported to a different world and they have to go on this whole adventure, right?  Now the thing about an isekai theme or show is that the moment I take a character that's Japanese and put them in that isekai environment, they're going to react to that world differently than say I took some black thug off of the street whose father died.  Right.  That character is not going to react to the world the same way.  a middle aged Japanese man who just got ran over by a truck is going to react to the world.  In the same way that if I took a Mexican kid, right, who grew up poor and his mom married some rich white guy, you know, a couple of years after his dad died, you know, um.  His perspective on life is gonna be different than the black thug who only grew up in poverty.  The juxtaposition of growing up poor and then getting a lot of money, and then now he died or got transported to another world, he's gonna be different or feel differently than the guy who never had a father, never saw him, his mom is on crack and all that.  We take a real thug, hard-edged guy, and we put him in this mystical fantasy world.  How is he gonna react to that environment and situation?  And a lot of these shows aren't taken into consideration, like the background of like how being a black person, how you experience the world is going to have an effect on you.  So now The Little Mermaid was an example I used earlier.  It hasn't come out yet, obviously.  I don't know what difference it will make if Ariel being black.  I don't know what difference it will make.  I don't know if it will make a difference.  But what I do know is that a lot of the time it doesn't.  It doesn't seem like these characters who are being changed to be black people are actually having any effect on the actual story that is occurring.  And that seems ridiculously stupid to me.  And it seems that I just don't really like the pandering, because, again, like, you have really great characters that I don't really think get a lot of shine.  Like, Virgil Hawking, otherwise, you know, Static, or Static Sean, you know, he's a great character.  He's actually very similar to Spider-Man, you know, in a lot of different qualities.  But he's a great character who definitely got some shine back in the early 2000s, but now recently... Not really talked about or discussed, but he's a great character.  He's his own man.  I don't see why that property isn't turned into a movie or turned into another TV show or is used.  For some reason, we get Black Lightning, and that's an incredibly PC show that's really heavy-handed.  I don't really get that, but whatever.  I mean, we do have Black Lightning, but, you know, for the most part, if I were to describe, like, a fantasy environment, you know, most of those characters are gonna be white people.  Like, there's a lot of white people that are definitely gonna come to the forefront of a lot of different television shows.  You know, any television show, you name off the top of your head, it's probably gonna have a cast filled with mostly white people.  And that's not a problem unto itself.  Like, the thing is, well, actually, for some white men, it can be a problem, right?  Because... For a lot of white characters, or white men specifically, when they're usually characters, they're usually used as a void, or what's the best word to use?  They're more used as a vehicle to tell a story, rather than a person that experiences the tale and kind of grows and measles.  Like Neo from The Matrix, right?  He doesn't really exist to be a complex guy that really thinks about anything, but he more exists.  so exposition can flow to him naturally and they can explain the world.  That happens to like a lot of white characters in shows.  So they're not really allowed to be characters as much as they're just exist solely for a story to take place.  And we as the audience follow them as they wow all over the place and get stuff explained to them.  So the curse of having like white, like a lot of people would say that white people are like, over-represent or represented in the media and they have all these white characters, but you also have to take into consideration that sometimes they may not be good characters.  They may not, you know, sometimes they may not even be characters as much as they're just vehicles for a story to be told.  So it's not a kind of, in my, so the overall point that I'm making in this video, at the end of the day, my ultimate point is that white, black, doesn't matter if there's no effect on the story, basically.  If you're gonna make a character, black, white, Mexican, Asian, Hispanic, whatever, mixed, There should be some background or something about them that influences how people react to them and how they react to the world.  And if you want to have a black social justice warrior that feels insulted by every misstep or everything that can be misconstrued as racist, becoming a superhero and having to deal with that, you can do it.  But it has to mean something is what I'm saying.  So turning Ariel into a black person... I'm not going to cry about anything like that.  I'm not offended and I'm not for it.  No, I'm actually more against it because I don't think that it does anything at the end of the day.  But I'm not mad.  I'm not really mad at most of these changes.  But I just feel like at the end of the day, it's really pandering and it's really stupid.  And there should be something more to these characters if you're going to change them rather than simply... diversity sake because at the end of the day it just looks like it's all just for diversity and i don't really like that.  so with that being said i think you guys got something out today's video and i hope you did.  man you know i click my button.  yeah shoot go and click that comment down box below.  as always you guys have yourselves a great day.  i'll see you cool cats soon adios.
