            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to Clownfish TV.  This is Neon and boy oh boy, it looks like those leaks, you know, those leaks that were not actually leaked.  Those leaks, the plot leaks for The Rise of Skywalker, yeah, they're legit.  It's becoming more and more apparent that the leaked plot for The Rise of Skywalker is probably true, or at least mostly true, because a new teaser trailer has dropped, Sith Dagger TV Spot.  I don't know what it's actually called, but thankfully some folks pointed me in this direction on Twitter, and here it is, guys.  The magic dagger, Vader's magic dagger, which is supposed to lead the way to Palpatine or something?  I'm not quite sure what it does, but this is another one of those ridiculous plot points that people thought could not possibly be true, becoming true.  So it's becoming more and more apparent that the leaked version of the movie, the rumored leaks from months ago, are at least partially true.  And if they are, that's going to be a problem because those leaks made the movie sound like trash.  So I don't know how else to say it.  The movie sounds like it's going to be a mess.  And boy, oh boy, we've only got a couple more weeks, right?  Okay, so before we get into the video, please subscribe for more pop culture news, views, and rants here on Clownfish TV.

If you're a real person, you want to hit that subscribe button again to make sure that you get our content.  So, all right.  Here it is, guys.  Here it is.  The magical, mystical dagger that people said, no, this isn't the plot.  This isn't the plot of episode nine.  JJ wouldn't do this.  That's ridiculous.  to have the plot revolve around a magic Sith artifact that magically guides our heroes to Palpatine.  And there it is.  Just like people said it was ridiculous that they were going to use C-3PO in the way that they supposedly were going to use him.  You know, 3PO has red eyes in one of the trailers, just like there were rumors of, you know, an overuse of horses and Palpatine returning and all of this stuff.  It all looks like it's coming true, guys.  And... With each new revelation, I'm like, we've already seen this movie.  We've already played this movie in our heads.  And it doesn't sound like it's going to be a very good movie.  It sounds like it's going to be very confusing.  Now, granted, it might play out better on the screen than it does on paper.  But I'm going to go talk about some of the rumored plot leaks.  For those of you who don't know, the basic direction this movie is going to take.  I'll talk a little bit about that, and we'll talk about some of the stuff that's been confirmed.  But yeah, I think the rumors are true.  So if the plot leaks that were denied are true, then could J.J.  Abrams be lying about those test screenings too?  I think he is.  You know, J.J.  Abrams hasn't proven himself to be very honest, at least with Star Trek fans.  Remember when he was adamant that Benedict Cumberbatch was not going to be Khan in the second Star Trek movie?  In fact, I'd totally forgotten about that.  I'd totally forgotten about that.  And a couple of our viewers reminded me of that in a previous video.  They said that, you know, J.J.  Abrams lies.  You can't trust anything he says.  Of course, they're going to lie about the test screenings.  Because Disney's not going to come out and say when everything, everything, the future of Star Wars depends on this movie.  right they're not going to come out and say that the test screening was so horrendous that people walked out or that people were upset.  they'll never admit to that.  they'll never admit to it.  um so i think there is a kernel of truth uh to all of this.  but this is so weird that just yesterday just yesterday bgr the first major star wars rise of skywalker spoiler reveals six surprising cameos The media doubling down.  The plot hasn't leaked online, no matter what certain actors did with the script while partying.  But we now have news of six amazing cameos we'll get to see in the coming episode.  And they talk about the voices, just the voice of Anakin, Obi-Wan, Luke Yoda, Ezra Bridger, and Maz Kanata.  No, the plot has been leaked online.  The movie, the terrible sounding movie that people have been talking about for months.  This is the movie we're getting on the 20th.  This is it.  Every time they drop a trailer, they confirm more and more of the plot.  We have Vader's magic dagger.  We had 3PO's red eyes.  We've got Leia with her lightsaber.  Yeah, Leia's going to have a lightsaber now, and apparently that is going to come into play later in the movie.  So much of this movie has been confirmed via leaks.  Now, I don't know if they were photoshopped or not, but there were some images floating around with Palpatine in his black and red robes, which was, again, rumored.  We had Kylo Ren fighting with a blue lightsaber, presumably his mother's, et cetera, et cetera.  If... those things are true, then the ending is probably also true.  And if the ending is true, it's going to piss off a lot of people.  It's going to piss off a lot of Star Wars fans.  Earlier today, We posted a video talking about how a Hollywood producer who does seminars at major colleges, Ivy League colleges, is now using The Last Jedi as an example of how not to write a screenplay.  I'm beginning to think that The Rise of Skywalker might give The Last Jedi a run for its money.  Absolutely.  And Disney is going to downplay all of this.  They want you to go opening weekend.  They want you to go.  They want your money.  They want your money.  And once they have your money, you know, it doesn't matter if you hated the movie.  They still got paid.  They still got paid.  So that's what this is about.  They're trying to hide as much of this movie as they actually can.  But people like us who've been following these leaks are starting to see the pieces come together.  And this is indeed the movie we're getting.  So for those of you who haven't been following the leaks, I'm going to do a real quick recap of what the basic plot of the movie reportedly is.  And I think that we're going to get some variation of this.  Of course, they did some reshoots.  So it could change from this, but this is sort of a recap, basically, of what's going to happen.  Kylo is looking for a MacGuffin.  A MacGuffin.  It's a device known as the Wayfinder.  He obtains the Wayfinder from an Oracle.  Who?  and finds it to contain coordinates to a point in the unknown regions.  The Wayfinder that Kylo has given once belonged to his grandfather.  So it's Vader's, is this his magic dagger?  Using the coordinates found within the Wayfinder device, Probably this.  Probably this.  Kylo arrives in the Unknown Regions.  Kylo encounters the Emperor.  So Kylo and Palpatine try to bring Rey to the dark side.  Yeah, this is very Return of the Jedi.  The source for the leak said specifically that Palpatine's very old and decrepit.  At this point, we saw in another trailer that looks like he's in some sort of life support chair or something.  He's like freaking Baron Harkonnen floating around.  I don't know what the hell is going on.  So he wants to build his empire again in order to facilitate bringing about the empire.  Palpatine has spent 30 years after the original trilogy creating a fleet of Death Star Destroyers.  Yes, these are the Star Destroyers with lasers, freaking lasers attached to their bow.  Again, this has also been confirmed.  We've seen pictures of them.  Here they are.  This looks like... The Star Destroyers we're talking about with the Death Star lasers in front.  Okay, so all of this is being confirmed with every leak.  There's no explanations to how Palpatine did this for 30 years.  He's building Death Star Destroyers.  What the hell?  So, meanwhile, they have a scene in the jungle with Leia.  Leia training Rey.  Leia now has a lightsaber again.  This has been confirmed.  There it is.  There it is.  At this point in the story, the Resistance makes their way to a desert planet, seeing the teaser and behind-the-scenes footage.  We talked about this before.  There's yet another desert planet, and they're looking for a Sith artifact that apparently turns out to be a dagger.  The dagger has some sort of writing on it that 3PO can't decipher.  And there it is.  So this is different than the Wayfinder.  So we got two MacGuffins.  I don't know, but that's, it's written in ancient Sith.  Apparently 3PO can't decipher it.  So they have to like, like wipe his memory or something.  That's why his eyes are red and he becomes like a battle protocol droid again, I guess.  There's a lot of forced Skyping between Kylo and Rey.  This has also been confirmed from various sources.  Yeah, as previously mentioned, 3PO is confirmed with the challenge you can't handle.  The artifact found on a Pasaana, I guess that's that desert plant, whatever the hell it's called, contains a language you can't translate without modifications.  3PO is modified to allow the translation of the artifact.  And that's probably how he winds up with the red eyes.  During the events leading to the modification of 3PO on the wintery plant, Kylo initiates another force connection.  So there's a lot of force skyping.  So Rey doesn't believe that her parents are nobodies.  They're fighting yada yada.  Zori Bliss is introduced.  The Falcon at some point gets stolen.  They have to get the Falcon back.  Hux apparently... apparently is siding with resistance because he doesn't like Kylo Ren, so we're going to have this big battle that supposedly... Supposedly involves the First Order fighting with their resistance against the Empire with the Star Destroyers, with the freaking lasers on their heads.  Yada, yada, yada.  There are some very tenuous week callbacks to the prequels in the original trilogy.  And they wind up fighting Palpatine, Rey, and Kylo.  Kylo turns to the good side and gets off.  I guess it's better than what... was originally written at like.  Luke and Leah were going to in ghost form somehow fight Palpatine.  I don't know.  But what gets me is, uh, you know, the big spaceship battle.  Yeah, we know the deal.  What gets me is the ending, the ending of the movie.  Uh, basically Ray decides she's going to be a Skywalker.  Cause it turns out that she's supposed to be Palpatine's granddaughter or, or something, uh, And she decides she's going to take the Skywalker name.  She takes the Skywalker name, takes Luke and Leia's lightsaber, makes her own lightsaber out of their lightsaber.  She can't even go get her own kyber crystal.  Then she becomes the Jedi master and moves into Luke's old house on Tatooine and starts telling everybody that she's Rey.  Skywalker, dramatic music, twin sons, the end.  So the Skywalker who rises is going to be Rey.  And that pisses me off because they destroyed Luke.  They destroyed Luke.  She's not a Skywalker by blood.  And if some of the other leaks are true, with Palpatine coming back one way or another, it also destroys Vader's sacrifice, Anakin's sacrifice.  It undoes everything the Skywalker boys did.  so Rey can come back and be a fake Skywalker and walk off with all of Luke's toys and his name, his title, his house, his droids... possibly the Falcon if they don't blow it up.  I mean, this is bullshit.  This is going to piss fans off.  But we're seeing daily that this is probably some variation of the movie we're actually getting.  And I think the blowback is going to be tremendous.  I don't think anything is going to prepare Lucasfilm for the kind of blowback they're going to get because I think this is going to make The Last Jedi look like a masterpiece.  So we're going to keep an eye on this, and I'll keep you guys updated if we get any other major leaks or any other confirmation of leaks.  You're on Clownfish TV, and we'll talk later.  Hey, guys.
