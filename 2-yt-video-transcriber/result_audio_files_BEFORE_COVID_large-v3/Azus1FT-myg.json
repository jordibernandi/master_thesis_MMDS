            "text": "Paul, now that the season's over, how has your shoulder been evaluated?  Do you know if there will be a procedure or anything along those lines?  Yeah, I'll address it pretty soon.  Try to nip it in the bud, get right away.  How much pain were you playing with throughout the playoffs?  Not much.  Not much at that point.  Is it a label?  That's what the room is.  I'm not going to discuss what it is.  Yeah, I'm not going to discuss what the actual injury is.  But I will address it soon, try to get it fixed and get back out there coming this next season.  Is there a sense that there was a lot left on the table because you were injured?  Is there that sense that you guys could have gone much further?  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  I mean, I think so.  You know, fact of the matter is injuries is part of the game.  It's what goes on during the game.  I don't got no excuses for it.  I mean, I was out there and I was able to compete.  So, you know, I was limited to a sense sometimes, but it didn't stop me from competing.  Paul, when you start to step back and take a broader look at this team, making the playoffs, obviously, again, but getting bouncy in the first round, what do you think needs to be better?  What needs to change to get further next year?  Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around that, on what's the next step, the next phase for this group going forward.  So, you know, that's... That's something I think we all are trying to work on internally, figure out what can we do because this is a team that can go far.  We have pieces in place to have a long postseason run.  I am trying to figure out what it is for this group.  How have you changed so much about your offseason preparation last season?  How much are you going to tweak that from last season?  Well, it's going to be a little different just with, you know, what I got dealing and what I got going on this summer.  So it's you know, I haven't had a plan yet to to address how to prepare going into this next season.  You know, we just finished playing.  So I'm not there yet with a plan.  I didn't expect to be done so suddenly.  So still working on that.  What do you like about what you all did collectively this year?  I thought, you know, we showed a lot of great and positive things this year.  I thought as a group and just my time, again, being here for another season, one of the closest teams I've been a part of still, you know, it's just a real brotherhood where, you know, you enjoy going out there with those guys.  Yeah.  I think that's a big positive going forward for this group is, you know, how close-knitted we are.  When you see the narrative about Russ, just who he is, how he interacts with people, some of it's negative out there.  What is it about him that maybe the average person doesn't get or understand about Russ and who he is as a person from day to day?  I think Russ is... Honestly, just as normal as anybody else.  I think anything he does is just amplified.  And, you know, if anybody know Russ on a personal level, you know that he's as real as it gets.  He's 100%.  He's his peer as a person that you can find.  If you're watching him from afar, you might mistake that for, you know... Him being a certain type of way.  But honestly, man, he's one of the best human beings I've ever been a part of.  I had a choice and a decision to go anywhere I wanted to in my career.  And I chose to come back here.  I mean, come on.  That says a lot on its own, what kind of person Russ is.  Does Russell ever make you cringe a little bit?  Because I hear what you're saying, but sometimes he doesn't do himself any favors, it seems like, when he deals with us or, you know, in certain places.  But you know him better than that.  Do you ever go, oh, Russ, you know, does he ever?  Um... I just I mean, it's it's.  it's a tough position to be in because I know being around them like I know where it's coming from.  Like it just doesn't come off the right way.  But I know where it's coming from.  You know, he's a guy of principles.  And, you know, everything he does is all principles.  You know, that's, you know, he's going to take care of himself and he's going to look out for himself.  And that's what you got to love about him, to be honest.  how it kind of shifted once you started dealing with the shoulder stuff.  You're an MVP candidate, maybe the leader at that point.  Do you look back on it?  Are you disappointed?  Are you frustrated?  How do you kind of view how things kind of turn for you?  You know, I just was frustrated.  I think it came at a terrible time, especially the team was rolling.  We was playing good.  I was holding up pretty, pretty, pretty good.  I just thought it came at the wrong time, honestly.  But again, I've never made no excuses on it.  I was dealing with it for a long time throughout the season.  It just got worse and worse as it went on.  But... It is what it is.  Again, I say it again.  Injuries is part of the game.  I've missed a season being hurt.  The training staff assured me I was fine to play through it.  I would be fine going forward.  I had no other thought in my mind but to be out there and play and ride it out with my guys.  Can you say a long time?  Is that longer than the two months after you had set up those three games?  Yeah.  How early?  I'm not going to say.  So, Paul, you said, you know, you weren't expecting this first-round exit.  Obviously, when you came back, you were expecting to go pretty far.  How do you digest something like this?  It's tough.  I'm still thinking about the series.  It's still not a good feeling for me.  I felt, especially that last game, Dame had an unbelievable game five.  But I felt like we were starting to become ourselves again.  We were playing fast.  Our defense was starting to hold up.  We were that athletic team again.  The ball was moving.  I just felt we had an identity again, and we started to feel ourselves again.  That was a pivotal game.  I felt if we won that, we definitely would have changed our momentum.  We would have been right where we wanted to be.  Not down in the series, but where we wanted to be in terms of how we were playing.  So I'm still digesting that.  It's tough for us being done right now.  And now we've got to think about what we could have and should have done better.  you know, got to let it go and move on, I guess.  Paul, is there a worry with your injury and how you sustain the injury and the way that you play and what makes you so great on defense?  Is there a worry moving forward that it could flare up again in future seasons?  or is it just kind of a free back the way it happened?  No, well, that's the reason I want to address it now.  I mean, I could leave it alone and This will be a reoccurring thing, but I want to address it now, clean up what needs to be cleaned up so it doesn't come back, and I'll be fine going forward.  I may have misheard, but since you obviously know more about it, do you anticipate being ready for preseason next season?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure the exact timetable on it.  Again, we're still trying to put a plan together on how to address it and what needs to be done.  One of the narratives of this season is you guys haven't shot the ball well enough.  You were really good from three, but not enough other guys were.  to get somebody else or for you guys to get better?  Well, I mean, you just look at it.  JG wasn't a high-volume three-point shooter in his career.  We, you know, asked him to shoot more threes this year.  And, you know, he shot at a high percentage.  But he'll get better with that now knowing that's what we need from him.  This is, you know, Ferguson's rookie season pretty much from playing and being on the court for a full season.  He'll get better with shooting the ball.  I mean, we'll, you know.  We'll get better with that, I think, as time goes on.  That's, you know, hopefully won't be the issue come next season.  Royce had sort of mentioned that first two-thirds of the season, basically, before you started dealing with the shoulder.  Have you had any maybe thoughts just about the game winners that you hit, that stretch of time there where you were really rolling and kind of what that felt like for you as a player to be at that level?  Yeah, I mean, it felt great.  It felt great just being in those moments, having opportunities to win games and put the game away on go-ahead baskets.  It felt great.  But again, I don't get into the whole stats of what I've made, what I've missed.  I'm going to shoot it.  I'm going to shoot it every time if I get a free enough look.  and feel confident in shooting it every time.  So, you know, for the people that are about the statistics and the stats of that shot, it felt good to just bury them for them.  Well, you know what it takes to play high-level defense in this league.  As the league has evolved with all this outside shooting, it kind of put us that are on the outside looking in.  How much more difficult is it to play defense in the league now with everybody bombing from so far?  Yeah, it's tough, and it's getting tougher if the three-point line extends to 35-plus feet now.  It gets tougher now because the floor is so spaced out, and it's just hard to be in help spots.  It puts a lot of pressure on one-on-one defenders.  Now, especially, you know, it's a tight whistle for touching, grabbing, holding.  It's a tight whistle for any contact away from the basketball or away from the court or from the basket.  So it puts just a lot more pressure on individuals to have to guard.  And, you know, I think that's what's, you know, why teams are getting those three and D guys up.  because you can't really hide guys anymore like you could with two traditional post players on the floor.  It's just a lot harder to hide guys.  So it's a lot of ownership now that you've got to play defense and have to be a pretty good defender now.  Like watch our series or watch what's going on?  Um... I'll watch it.  I'll watch it.  Yeah, I'll watch bits and pieces of it.  I probably won't watch all the games for the full entire game, but I'll watch bits and pieces and kind of just see.  I did that with the Utah series last year of what I could have done better.  You know, how I could have been a better player, you know, because that was the last opportunity, last chance I had on the season.  So I'll do that again with the Portland series.  Just watch, you know, stuff here and there just to see what improvements I should have did and could have made and go from there.  Yeah.  No, it is.  It is.  It is.  I mean, it's the same as anybody going over their work.  You know, it's what my job is, is to improve and get better.  So I'll do it.  Yeah, I think we got a good foundation.  I think we got a lot of great stuff accomplished.  You know, and we're going to continue to work and talk with Billy and figure out, you know, what's best for the team offensively, defensively.  I think that's the best thing about Billy is he takes our, you know, input and it's always an open dialogue.  And, you know, he's open with coaching and, you know, adjustments.  So it's great communication with Billy.  Anybody else?  Paul, we've talked plenty about Ferguson and his development throughout the season.  What advice do you give a guy like him who's improved so much in season two to continue to do that in his third season?  I think the same thing I had to approach and address going into my third year.  Third year for me was where I made the biggest jump from being a rotation guy to being a player.  I think Ferg has to put pressure on Coach now to use him more, to use him in the offense.  I think that's what you want out of your young guys.  is for them to put pressure on the coach to increase his, whether it's offense, defense, increase his production out there.  So he's got to have a big summer.  He's got to work on a lot of stuff, work on a lot of just ball handling, pick and roll, shooting, defense, because this is a pivotal year for young guys, their third year.  He's got to make a jump for us. ",
