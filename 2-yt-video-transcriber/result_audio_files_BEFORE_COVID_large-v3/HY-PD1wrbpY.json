I mean, oh, oh, I tell you, if you could smell.  I wish I had smell-o-vision.  Because you would absolutely love this.  So I'm kind of combining the message here with this and I'm going to make an appeal to you all.  And I really still would like to do the idea of bringing someone over here.  And I'm going to still go around asking businesses and I'm going to still go to various large companies and see if we can get some sponsorship to do that.  But I'm also going to ask you if you could also donate.  Put your money where your mouth is and see if we can raise enough money to try and help get one of our messengers here.
