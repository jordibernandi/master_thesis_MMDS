She's perhaps most noteworthy for authoring the Green New Deal.  This bill proposes the introduction of $12 trillion worth of new punitive taxes and regulations in the American economy, in an aim to help curb the  U.S.'s  contribution to the global climate crisis.  The radical measures have been estimated to yield an aggregate cost of $93 trillion.  To put that into better perspective, that's $600,000 per U.S.  household.  Also slated for demise are all those capitalistic perks we have to give up, such as basic air travel, two-day shipping, most supermarket produce, and probably more. ",

Prior to this innovation, many households had food scraps that would linger around.  This would cause clogged plumbing, smell, and pests.  The ability to grind this waste and do away with it at the sink right after food prep seemed like a natural upgrade.  But Senator Cortez's concerns seemed completely to miss the practical value households gained from garbage disposals.  Instead, she improperly assumed this machine, because of energy consumption, was potentially harmful to the environment and should be. ",
