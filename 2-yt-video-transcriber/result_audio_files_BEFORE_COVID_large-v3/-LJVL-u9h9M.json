For decades, such accusations have been effectively used to silence any criticism of the Israeli government.  But the tactic is no longer working.  Here's five inspiring Jewish individuals and groups who effectively debunk the ridiculous notion that criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic.  Number one, Bernie Sanders. ",

I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitler's concentration camp.  I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being. ",

We must not, however, equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing Netanyahu government in Israel.  Rather, we must develop an even-handed Middle East policy which brings Israelis and Palestinians together for a lasting peace.  What I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate.  That's wrong. ",

            "text": "So many people are looking at what is being reported about what Ilhan Omar said without looking at what she actually said.  The context was very clear.  She was talking about the influence of pro-Israel lobbies on members of Congress.  She wasn't talking about Jews.  It had nothing to do with Jews, Jewish people, anything else.  The congressman out in California a day or two ago said questioning the U.S.-Israeli alliance is unacceptable, unacceptable to question it.  Yet that relationship leads to us spending $3.8 billion a year on the Israeli military.  It leads to the US protecting all Israelis from being held accountable in the United Nations.  It leads to the US providing all the military support for Israel to maintain its often war crime level violations of international law in how it uses those weapons against Palestinians.  So the US is complicit in all of that.  So if we don't question the US-Israeli alliance, we are more complicit than ever.  We need to question it.  We need to challenge it.  And the notion that that's anti-Semitism really sort of boggles the mind. ",
