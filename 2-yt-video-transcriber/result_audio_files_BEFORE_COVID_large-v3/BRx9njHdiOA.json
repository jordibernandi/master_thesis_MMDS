            "text": "Hey Amigdos, this is Benjen.  I just got done priming the trailer.  These are very nice dust masks.  They have this little exit filter so the moisture doesn't just build up hideously behind the mask, making it It's nearly impossible to wear it for a long period of time.  That's my big gripe with normal dust masks, but I can wear one of those most of the day.  Yeah, good times.  I've got the door or the tailgate all designed and I'll show you how it goes together in a day or two.  Good times.  It doesn't look very good, but this is just the priming coat.  Just to make the real paint stick.  I'll do a better job of the actual exterior paint.  I was just listening to a YouTuber, a new, I think he's a new guy.  He might be of the PUA side and he was like teaching people game and whatnot, but he actually was saying that he has been a MGTO for about 12 years and didn't even know it.  I'll see if I can dig that thing up and provide a link.  And he was saying that And it's like very profound.  This is like basic red pill philosophy right here.  A man's primary power in a relationship is his ability to leave.  And when we get married, that basically wipes out every single advantage that men have historically had in marriage.  And totally... totally puts every female advantage on steroids.  so they have all every one of their advantages.  that crocodile tears that deception and the lies and the narcissism and all of that stuff is uh right right at their fingertips and it's and it's been supercharged because of the.  at any time she wants she can pick up the phone and have you arrested and hauled off to jail And depending on how bad the accusation is, you can be in there for months.  I saw a friend of mine, he was stuck in jail for three months just because his enraged wife just went insane with a false accusation that was like so vile, so over the top evil that the police just buried him in jail for three months.  And it was a hell of a thing for a young man to see.  And that was my red pill.  That was the final ingredient of the red pill.  Since I didn't have the internet really back then, I had to make my own red pills.  I had to mix them up and do all the math and hash the whole thing out and put all the pros and cons of lists.  Talk to older mechanics about their marriages and... And it was the hardest decision I've ever made to say, no, can't do it.  But our ability to leave the relationship is the only thing that keeps a woman from just going totally crazy with power, totally insane with abuse.  And And then, of course, when the man has less power than the woman does because of her ability to call the police and the horrible sword hanging over his head, that how badly it would just wreck the man if the woman decided to just ass launch him from the relationship.  It's that power that we once had to leave is gone.  We can physically leave, but our finances will just be wrecked.  And then, of course, if we're attached to our children, men tend not to want to have children anymore.  Until we have them.  And then once we have children, we get very fond of them.  Same with pets.  I am not a pet guy.  I'm not a big dog guy.  But my dad's dog really, really... attached himself to my heartstrings.  He was a bitch and a half when he passed away.  But in any case, our ability to leave is just absolutely hamstrung and totally obliterated.  And every advantage that a woman has to counterbalance the man's greater physical strength, greater logical ability, ability greater long-term planning ability um all of the the advantages that she has to um to counterbalance the tremendous power we have is still there and even made more dramatic and any like the ability to summon the community to to beat up whoever she points to, right?  That power is all still there.  So basically, yeah, don't get married.  So in any case, about my fast, I went for 17 days.  It was Well, it wasn't a real fast until toward the end when I stopped taking my medications.  Then, man, I had no idea how much easier it is To just do a straight water fast without restarting my system twice a day to take all those freaking meds.  Yeah, I guess that was a hard lesson.  I learned the hard way.  So I won't be doing that.  Next fast I do, all the medications stay right on the shelves.  And I'm just going to fast.  I'm doing mostly an intermittent fast right now.  And I dropped my weight during the big fast down to like 197.  And then when I started eating again, I rebounded to like 206 or something.  And now as of this morning, just by eating modestly and mostly one meal a day, I have dropped down to 200 again, even.  So, yeah, good times.  Tomorrow, my dad and I, if all plans work out.  well, we are taking off to another state.  And we're going to do a little house shopping.  And mostly I'm just going to go down there and take a look at the town.  See if it's really where I want to have my sort of home base.  And then the plan is to just put him into the house, and he'll have the utilities and everything in his name.  And I'll be on the title with rights of survivorship, so whichever of us passes away sooner, the other one gets the house.  So then, after that, it's off to Mexico, and... I've got a couple of cancer clinics down there that I'm looking at.  And up here, I'm still getting the megadose vitamin C through the IV treatments.  That has been known to wipe out cancer all by itself.  So yeah, basically, yeah, things are going quite well.  Yeah, just to reiterate, Man, our ability to leave is our greatest power.  And as soon as you move in with a woman or marry a woman, you have just gotten rid of that entire advantage, putting her firmly in the driver's seat, no matter what delusional BS you tell yourself or how traditional she is and how she would never, ever do all of that evil shit.  Well... She can, at any time, she can.  And my ability to trust a woman for like 20 years, that on her absolute worst day throughout that entire 20 years, she has become utterly pissed off at me.  She wants to cheat.  She wants to do all that stuff.  Chances are she's going to do it.  I mean... throughout an entire 20-year span, can you really count on her to be loyal and fair and honest and just decent and reasonable and honorable?  Can you really depend on that on the worst day of the entire 20 years or more that you're going to be married to her?  No, you can't.  So I can't.  I realized it was just, it's just really stupid to even think of, you know, to even consider such a thing.  So the result was I didn't do it.  And I'm not sorry.  Life turned out pretty darn good.  And if you guys have seen the Bitcoin price lately, you'll know what I mean.  And with the recent increase, the pressure on me to sell the house right now and move really quick, all of that pressure is pretty much gone.  I've got enough of a budget to last me comfortably forever.  You know, at least until two pensions and Social Security start paying something.  If, you know, in 11 years, those things are still around.  So in any case, if we have such instability in the conventional economy and monetary system that we don't have Social Security or those pensions, well, the result is most likely that alternatives to the conventional financial system will get very, very popular and Bitcoin's right up on the top of the list.  So that will tend to push.  If those systems fail that badly over the next 11 years or so, the alternatives will get pushed up rather dramatically in price.  And, man, that would just make me totally freaking disgustingly stinking rich.  Yeah, I could definitely be on board with that.  Okay, guys, I'm going to let you go.  Don't surrender your advantage.  Your one advantage when it comes to dealing with a woman is your ability to leave.  Just don't give it up.  You cannot trust her.  Not with that much power.  I realized I couldn't do it.  I tried and tried.  Tried to think of a way that I could work around it, you know, find a workaround, find a solution to the problem.  But it just isn't there.  So the result is life turned out pretty good anyway.  That's all I got for you guys.  And don't get married. ",
