And the old Eden Hashish Center is just an ordinary budget hotel.  Despite a small political movement to legalize hashish, marijuana is legal one day a year for religious purposes only.  The rest of the time, tourists and locals take their chances on the black market.  With its wild days behind it, Freak Street has mostly dropped the drug trade and reinvented itself as a destination for mountain trekking.  These days, the real action is in Tamil.  A short walk from Freak Street, Kathmandu's thumping nightlife hotspot offers visitors every kind of indulgence that was available during Freak Street's heyday, and many more that the hippies couldn't have imagined on their wildest trip.  And a recent retro hit is reviving Kathmandu's hippie heritage. ",
