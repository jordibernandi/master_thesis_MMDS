            "text": "So, when you think of a conservative, what do you think of what pops into your head like the mental image you know?  uh for me i typically think of a boomer just an old boomer white dude maybe in their 50s to 60s.  um you know either ironically enough either in a suit or wearing a wife beater that is stained with uh with beer and butter and cheese and shit like that.  that's typically what comes to mind when i think of a conservative or a fucking psychotic conspiracy theorist like this fucking dude who we all know and love.  we're gonna give you a clip of this.  i'm a pioneer i'm an explorer i'm a human and i'm coming.  i'm animated i'm alive my heart's big.  it's got hot blood going through it fast.  i like to fight too.  i like to eat.  i like to have children.  i'm here.  I got a life force.  This is a human.  This is what we look like.  This is what we act like.  This is what everybody was like before us.  This is what I am.  I've got the fire of human liberty.  I'm setting fires everywhere, and humans are turning on everywhere.  That's typically what I think of when I think of a conservative.  That's about it.  That's generally what comes to mind.  Usually.  Most of the time.  Ignore how bright it is coming out of my window now, blurring my camera.  But I've discovered... I've discovered a fucking... I've discovered a crazy Reddit.  I believe it's called Conservative Zoomers, if I remember correctly.  Chad told me about it today.  Let's see... Chad, go ahead and leave it in chat if you know where it is.  I'm trying to find it right now.  r slash zoomer right, there it is.  Okay.  Yeah.  So, yes, generally when I think of a conservative, I think of the boomer, conspiracy theorist, psychotic, you know, older person, usually.  That's what you think of when you think of a conservative.  However, however, uh, there is a very unfortunate epidemic of young people, of teens, of Zoomers, turning to the right.  And I found a Reddit that just compiles this, and it's quite, it's quite great.  It's actually pretty amazing.  We got this very, very fitting thing up here.  Um... let's see.  hey israel chernobyl reopens old wound for thousands of israelis and here's your equal attention cake.  i don't know if that's a zoomer meme.  yeah it's.  i honestly don't because this is a nazi meme but i i don't.  is does this count as zoomer?  i don't know.  That's a little, that's a little more than Zoomer.  Can I get an ACAB in chat?  13, 12.  Oh, God.  When you see a cute girl and you hear she likes you and you're gonna ask her out, but she likes Israel.  Now, this works as a leftist meme and as a conservative meme.  Now, chances are this was made by a Nazi, alright?  You know, Jews bad and all that.  But leftists also don't like Israel, because Israel's an ethnostate and the shit they do to the Palestinians.  So it works.  It works.  Oof, I love this one.  Y'all really wanna get married and have sex with the same person for the rest of your life?  And then the, uh, the meme with... the Aryan white man, who I don't know if it's supposed to resemble PewDiePie with a beard, I think it is, um, saying yes, and then that's, that's, that's her, apparently.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you see these memes on Twitter a lot.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, there's a good one, there's a good meme here, there's a good meme that, um, Hold on.  I want to show you the best one.  Chad sent it to me earlier today.  And I just want to... I just want to... I just want to show this one to you guys.  It's a good one.  It's a fucking good one.  Yeah, get a look at this meme.  The CEO of crime and a black person saying, I'll buy 35% of your stocks.  This isn't just a conservative Zoomer meme.  This is just a straight up white supremacist Zoomer meme.  Look at that.  You love to see it.  Young people turning to bigotry.  It's amazing.  Let's see what else we got here.  Well, you actually believe race mixing is bad.  And so... What am I supposed to say about this one?  Really?  What the fuck am I supposed to say about this one?  Le Broken Branch Cuck.  Is that... I actually don't know what that's a reference to.  If I were to take a wild guess, I would assume it has something to do with, like, family trees and the branches breaking because of race mixing?  I mean, I'm not gonna Google it, I don't give a fuck, but that's what comes to my head.  Why do these commies keep disrespecting Israel?  That's where Jesus was born.  Okay, that's a boomer meme.  lynchings in congo is penis theft.  panic hits capital.  ho there traveler i need to check your belongings.  there has been a rash of penis theft lately.  african moment great my ancestor oh the u.s soldiers were anti.  wait are some of these people unironically posting these here as like not as a meme?  like unironically posting this here?  Because the way this person typed the caption out... Uh-huh.  Can we dissect... Wow, iFunny, great.  Can we dissect this meme for a second?  Because it's a meme I see quite a bit when it comes to Nazis.  Nazis love to share this kind of shit around.  So... You do realize that you, like, deformed the shit out of this lady's head here.  Like, the white lady... Like, you deformed her head.  Like, this lady's head isn't deformed in any way.  But with the white lady, like, you used the tool to sort of indent it down.  These aren't the same... This isn't the same shape.  You couldn't even Photoshop it right, you fucking idiot.  Let's see, what other spicy Zoomer memes do we have here?  No e-girls ever, nice meme.  Is that?  No.  I know the person on the left, I'm pretty sure, is Richard Spencer.  Is that like a somewhat?  No, that can't be Sargon.  That's not Sargon.  Yeah, I know.  I know Rave Deepin.  I know.  The first black girl, her head is just tilted up.  Yeah, I know.  Other than that, I think you guys get the point.  I definitely recommend checking out that sub.  It's still pretty small, but it does encapsulate conservative humor.  Actually, no.  It gets worse.  Have you guys ever... Have you guys ever made the mistake of going to the Instagram Explore page?  Can you do that on... Can you even do that on... On this... On, like, a desktop Instagram?  Have you seen how cancer the memes are?  On this... I can't.  I actually can't do it.  I'm just gonna look up memes on Instagram, see what comes up.  Hashtag dank memes.  Let's see what comes up when you search hashtag dank memes.  Okay.  There's some reactionary shit that you can find here.  Let's see, um... Let's see if I can find one.  Usually they just kind of pop up.  Hey!  There they are.  If you search hashtag dank memes and you scroll down this far, we get a spicy Ben Shapiro meme.  Liberal.  Breathes.  Ben Shapiro.  Hippity hoppity.  Your tears are now my property.  Yeah!  Yeah!  That's one minute old.  Nardi has one like.  I want to find one that has a lot of... Changing I to W, changing illness to wellness.  That's a good meme.  This meme looks good, alright, yeah.  Not a tanky, but it's a spicy one, alright.  Let's see what else we get.  That's a good meme.  This is a good one.  Some of the Zoomers I still think have hope, but holy shit.  There was, um... I found a meme on Instagram, which you should never, you should never go to this.  Like, if you have Instagram, don't fucking search the Explore page on Instagram.  Oh god, okay.  Don't fucking go to the Explore page on Instagram, okay?  It's a fucking hell, it's a fucking hellscape, okay?  It's bad.  So I found... It's okay, guys.  I scrolled up quickly.  So I decided to go to the Explore page on Instagram last night, and I just find this really... innocuous Zoomer meme that happens throughout climate change.  It was like, um, it was an OK Boomer meme, where it's like, climate change, uh, when a boomer says climate change isn't real, me, OK Boomer, and then it's like a picture of Spongebob just sitting, like, with, like, the face, you know?  And I went down the comments, and I just see thousands of comments as I scroll up of people saying climate change isn't real, it's not though, it's not though, it's not though.  Like, holy shit.  And I look at these accounts, And these accounts have names like, uh, uh, 1 million likes for no reason or dank zoomer memes and shit.  Like, you go to the accounts and you know they're run by, like, a 15-year-old.  You know?  You know the accounts I'm talking about?  If you're on Instagram, you know what I'm talking about.  Like, holy shit.  What is up with so many zoomers going to the right?  Like, I know the alt-right rabbit hole exists, okay?  It's a thing.  But I really can't imagine that that's what's playing a part in all this.  Like, the alt-right rabbit hole, at the very least, is just at least somewhat of a contained phenomenon, right?  Like, it's mostly contained to a pretty somewhat niche community on YouTube.  A niche topic.  But this seems like it's something different.  I really don't... I really don't know what's going on here, but you guys can leave your best theories in chat and in the comments.  Why are so many Zoomers becoming conservatives? ",
