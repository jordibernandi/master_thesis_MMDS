And I have a special guest today to talk about a powerful movie that's coming to theaters March 29th.  It commences in theaters across the nation.  And this movie deals, I tell you, powerfully.  We've seen the movie.  It's going to be absolutely astounding with the topic of abortion.  And as you know, that has been headline news right now across this nation.  42 million children a year are actually killed by abortion around the globe.  But in America, there have been all sorts of moves by different people to try to actually allow abortion right up until and even after a baby is born.  This movie comes at a very, very strategic time.  And I'm going to encourage you to take your children.  Now it is a little graphic in a couple of places.  It needs to be actually.  So maybe you wanna think about the age that you take.  I'll ask Michael what he thinks, but certainly teenagers and above, But Michael, Michael Scott from PureFlix.com.  And of course, we have hundreds of our video titles on PureFlix.  And I encourage people to make sure they subscribe to PureFlix to get that.  But this movie is called Unplanned.  So tell us a little bit about the movie, a summary of this movie. ",

            "text": "Well, unplanned, I think in this movie about the sanctity of life being a pro-life movie, it's such a timely subject with what we're dealing with in our society today.  But it really deals with this story of Abby Johnson, who worked at a Planned Parenthood and eventually became the director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Houston and performed over, underneath that clinic, performed over 20,000 abortions.  And then one day she saw in the back room really what was happening and where things were going and what was taking place with these abortions.  And it horrified her and the guilt and the pain and all that she realized that she had done.  She left the clinic and ultimately became a pro-life advocate and changed lives.  you know, everything that she was doing.  And it's a powerful testimony.  You see what happened, what's going on in our society, but ultimately the importance of really, this isn't an inanimate object that's in someone's womb.  It's a life that's in there.  And you're going to see the power of that.  I encourage, I find it interesting.  One of the things is the movie got an R rating, unfortunately.  And it wasn't because of language or, you know. ",

And she wasn't sure whether this was the right role for her.  She went and did it, showed up on set, got all her lines memorized and stuff like that.  Did not tell her family at all.  The day she's on set, she calls up her family and says, Mom and Dad, I'm in this movie called Unplanned, explained what the movie was about.  And her mom just started to weep and break down in tears.  And she asked, what's wrong, Mom?  She says, you have no idea what this means or what this is.  She goes, when I was pregnant with you, I was making a decision on whether or not I was going to abort you or keep you.  And ultimately, she was kept.  And it was such a time as this that she was in this movie.  So it's a powerful kind of true life meets the movie at the same time.  story that's there.  It's all those things.
