Or a slightly more in-depth answer is this one.  Now I like to explain the term allele to children as calling it the flavour of a gene.  So everybody has a gene for her colour.  Everybody has a gene for eye colour.  But the particular colour, whether that be blue or brown, will be the allele.  And the term allele frequency just tells us how prevalent a specific allele is within a population.

So I'd have to do some refreshing, but the twisted ladder, the long twisted chromosome ladder, has the rungs across it, the genes.  There can be frequency differences between different people.  You may have some insertions like an ERV.  Let's do a whole debate just on that at another time.  I don't have any slides ready for that right now.

Now, when you pass this integration onto any of your offspring, it will occur in the same one in 50 million chance location.  This makes them very useful tools in tracing lineage.

Cytochrome C, which is a protein found in the mitochondria, is an example of such a protein.  Now, the cytochrome C that's found, for example, in yeast will also work if it's placed in cats, plants, and a whole range of weird and wonderful beasts.  Now, there are many, many forms of the gene that produces cytochrome C, but the distribution of this gene among eukaryotes is not random.  So in other words, species that fossil records say are closely related have the closest matching genes, with chimps and humans having exactly the same gene.  However, species that fossil records say are distantly related have the most different version of this gene.  Now, this fits in perfectly with the predictions made by evolution, as species that are further apart will have the most different version of this gene because of mutation, but it doesn't fit at all with the creation argument.  After all, why would God create so many different versions of a gene that does the same job and then place them in organisms deliberately to make it look like evolution has occurred? ",
