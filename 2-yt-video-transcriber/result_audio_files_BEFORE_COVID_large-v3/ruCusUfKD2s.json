            "text": "The Atheist Debates Patreon Project presents, A Bible Verse I Was Wrong About.  So some of you may have heard me talk about a passage before, Matthew 18, 19, and I thought I'd go ahead and touch on it because it turns out I was wrong.  And when you're wrong, you should acknowledge that you were wrong.  This isn't just a matter of context or the context will come into it because quite often people will say, well, you're taking it out of context.  So my entire purpose here is to make sure we put it back into context.  And for clarity, Matthew 18, 18 is the verse that essentially the movie Dogma was based on.  I'll do it from the King James and read 18, 19 to 20, and then I'll switch back over to the NIV so that you can hear kind of a more plain English version.  But Matthew 18, beginning at verse 18, it says, Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  Verse 19, again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  And verse 20, for where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them.  Now, I'm gonna switch over to the New International Version for these same passages because what will quite often happen is people will say, oh, well, you know, you read it out of context or either this is a translation issue or whatever else.  So those same verses in the NIV Begin with verse 18.  Truly, I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  Verse 19.  Again, truly, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.  For where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am with them.  And I have said on many occasions, paraphrasing verse 19, that this verse basically says if there are two true Christians who agree on something, God will grant it.  And I used to point out that this clearly means that at no point in history have there ever been two true Christians who agreed and prayed together to end war, suffering, poverty, anything like that, or make any sort of positive change along those lines.  And I was wrong.  The question is, what was I wrong about?  Because a plain reading of the verse says that.  Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven.  That's verse 18.  And verse 19 is again, truly I tell you, that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for it, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.  The thing that I was wrong about was my logic here because I excluded other possibilities.  Yes, if we read that verse, that means that if two people right now agreed to pray for an end to the Trump administration and it didn't happen, it means nobody's prayed for it or an end to suffering or whatever else.  I overlooked some possibilities though.  That's where my failure was.  My failure wasn't necessarily in understanding the verse, although we'll get to some context in a minute.  there were other possibilities.  For example, if there are two people who are praying for a war to stop and two people who are praying for the war to continue, how does God decide which of those two he should potentially grant?  So there may be the case that there were two people who've been praying for an end to war and an end to poverty, and there were other people who were praying to keep poverty going.  And what happens quite often along those lines is people will say, ah, yes, but you have to be praying for what is in God's plan.  And I will get back to that point.  But I realized there was another possibility because if you were the first person to read this particular passage in Matthew, you might come across it and go, hang on a second.  This as if two of us here on earth agree for something and pray for it, God will grant it.  And so let's go ahead and do that.  Um, let's the two of us agree to pray that we become instantly wealthy.  and those two people pray and they become instantly wealthy and they realize, wow, this is a, this is amazing.  However, it's a little too dangerous.  So what we should pray is for us to get together and pray that God will stop granting prayers prayed in this fashion.  And then as soon as they pray that this passage becomes null and void for everybody else.  Yeah, all right.  My apologies to the biblical scholars and the theists who came in thinking that I was going to say, oh, I've been wrong all this time about a Bible verse.  I was wrong about how I dealt with this particular passage.  If you look at the NIV, this entire paragraph or this entire collection of verses is labeled as dealing with sin in the church.  And it starts actually at verse 15.  And so it's saying here, if your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault just between the two of you.  So if somebody is doing something that is against doctrine, you should go and talk to them privately.  And if they listen to you, you have won them over.  Cool.  Have a private discussion.  And if they change their ways, you won.  Well, obviously you won.  Verse 16, but if they will not listen, take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.  This is really about how to keep your church peaceful.  You know, hey, you've been showing up at church and you've been doing things that we don't think are biblical.  Oh, you're not going to listen to us?  Fine.  We'll get a couple other people and we'll come in and we'll have this little intervention counseling session.  And then in verse 17, it says, if they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church.  And if they refuse to listen, even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.  Now, I'm not going to go into detail in this video about how to treat pagans and tax collectors or why pagans and tax collectors keep coming up as the bad guys in all this.  Verse 18, which I've already read, is the one that I think was probably used for the film Dogma, essentially saying, you know, you guys have stated what is doctrine here.  You have created your own dogma and God is bound by this verse to follow through with it.  But verse 19 is the one where it says, if two of you are gathered together, whatever you ask for, God will grant it, or my Father in heaven will grant it.  That doesn't have caveats in it.  It's not even clear that this only applies to this section, which the NIV labels as dealing with sin in the church.  It reads, plain-faced reading, as... If you ask for it, and two of you are sincere, God will do it.  Now, obviously, this can't be the case.  I mean, this is, we talk about prayer and whether or not prayer works.  Spoiler alert, prayer doesn't work.  Intercessory prayer has been tested and it succeeds at the rate of chance unless people know they're being prayed for, in which case it does worse.  It's indistinguishable from flipping a coin.  And when something is indistinguishable from a coin toss, we're pretty well justified in saying this does not work.  There is no demonstration of efficacy here.  But it seems to be a very dangerous passage to put in there because In the best, most charitable understanding of Christian doctrine, as this passage has been studied over the years, what it really means is wherever two or more of you are gathered, I'm there.  That's verse 20, or I am among you, which is particularly strange because God or Jesus is supposed to be everywhere all the time.  So of course he's there, whether there's two of you or three of you or one of you or none of you.  He's evidently under rocks on Mars even.  So that last sentence is kind of nonsense.  There are other passages in the Bible that people will go to in order to help understand this passage and others.  One is that God has a plan.  Everything goes according to God's plan.  God knows what's going to happen.  God isn't, and this isn't a verse, this is kind of paraphrasing Christian doctrine, God isn't a wishing well where you can go and pray for something and God will just do it.  And then they would come back to this verse and say, but hang on, Matthew 18, 19 specifically says, whatever two or more of you ask, my Father in heaven will grant it.  And the caveat then becomes, ah, yes.  But what we're talking about?  when we say two or more, this would have to be two Christians who are seeking God's will.  And this is why in the Lord's prayer, you pray, thy will be done.  You don't ask for things as if he's a cosmic vending machine.  You pray for his will to be done.  But that renders prayer down to nothing more than, hey, God, do this if you want to.  Well, why does God need you to say that?  And if he wants to, he'll do it.  And if he didn't want to, it's not like you're going to convince him to change his mind, are you?  Well, I don't know, some Old Testament passages that suggest that God is both unchanging and that God changed his mind or that people pleaded with him to change his mind.  And so then you get into the apologetics that say, yes, but God knew he would change his mind.  And so at the end of the day, this passage should probably be better, more accurately written according to doctrine as whenever two of you who are sincere believers seeking the will of God get together and ask for something, God will do it if it is in fact the will of God.  And so that really points out the uselessness of prayer.  It would be like as if you were going to your mom and saying, Mom, I'd really, really, really like to go to this concert if it's within your will.  And of course, if it's within your will, you're going to go to the concert.  And if it's not, then you're not.  So what was the point in asking?  And your mom, of course, isn't God, but if God already knows what he's going to do and knows what's in his plan, he certainly doesn't need you to ask for it.  And he knew you were going to ask for it, but he also knew you were going to ask for the things that weren't part of his plan.  And at no point is there any kind of communication to say, yes, I'm saying yes, no, I'm saying no.  And so humans are left to just basically say, we prayed and something happened and we're going to... assume a causal connection between our prayer and this mystical being and the events, when at most you have an incredibly weak correlation.  Why would an all-wise, all-knowing deity include a verse that basically says in literal form, Whatever two or more of you ask for, I will grant it.  If what they really mean, which you have to get from other verses in other books and surrounding contexts is, I'm going to do whatever I want, whether you ask me or not.  And if you ask me for something and it's something I want to do, I'll do that.  Prayer doesn't make any sense.  When I was a Southern Baptist, what I was taught about prayer is of course that God isn't a vending machine and you can pray for God to do things and he either will or won't depending on what he wants to do.  But the purpose of praying was to let God know that you were subordinate to his will and that you recognized that you needed to ask for things according to his will.  But God already knows that, which means the only point of it is for you to recognize it.  So prayer is about you showing God something that he already knows, namely whether or not you are willing to be subject to his will and seek his will.  It makes you a puppet acknowledging the strings to a being who already knows whether or not you acknowledge it.  It is patently absurd.  And the inclusion of a verse like this And many, many, many others, and we'll hit others at different points, but to include a verse like this can only sow confusion.  It's an irrelevant passage.  It doesn't need to be said.  A better passage would be God's going to do whatever God wants to do.  And you can plead all you want, but God's never going to do anything that isn't according to his will.  But every now and then you should let God know that you're aware that you are subject to his will, even though God already knows that you know, that you're aware.  This is the problem with the Bible in general and passage about prayer in particular.  We'll see you next time. ",
