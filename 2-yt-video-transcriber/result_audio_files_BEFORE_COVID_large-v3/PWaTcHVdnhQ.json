He literally fell to the floor and told his mom, you shouldn't love me, I'm worthless.  And then started repeating the things about himself that they were calling him because he's a Jew.

But again, this is this is the type of abuse that should be called out and not when you say anything bad about Israel or anything about Judaism.  that's not anti-semitic.  This is anti-semitic, right?  This is this is what you need to call out as nonce and this is this is not anti-semitic, you know Antisemitism is rising everywhere in Europe, in the United States.  It was always huge in Islamic countries, but it's becoming even bigger.  And that's a big problem.  So find where it is a real problem and point at it and call it out and try to take actions against it.  Instead of trying to find people's legitimate concerns, even non legitimate concerns about Israel's policies, that's not anti-Semitic.  If you talk about Judaism as a religion and attack that, that's not anti-Semitic.  This is anti-Semitic.  This is what you need to call out as anti-Semitic.  And I mean, this captures people's attention because there was a photograph.  But there's a lot more stuff like this happening that is not being reported on, especially in Islamic countries.  Especially in Islamic countries, there's a lot of anti-Semitic views that needs to be called out.  So just do it properly.  Let me see.  Shah... Sharma saying but Quran allows such acts.  It's a religion of peace after all God.  I'm so tired of that joke.  Yeah.  Yeah, we know Islam is not a religion of peace.  It's a violent religion, but come up with new material. ",

If they were Muslims, their voices would be heard.  But they are atheists, and not many seem to be listening.  Let's make it difficult for them to ignore us.  We have built a global community, and now we are tearing down geographic, cultural, and language barriers so we can find each other and support each other.  In the last decade, we have built the largest atheist community in the world.  Now we are doing the same in other languages.  With your help, we have started Atheist Republic in Persian and Arabic.  As we grow, we can dedicate more time, staff and resources to start doing the same in Spanish, Portuguese, Malay, Bengali, Urdu, Hindi and other languages.  We are providing community, support, informative content and amplifying the voices of those who need protection, especially in countries where people feel isolated simply for their lack of belief.  We want to be there for them, and we are only getting started.  Help us get there.  Check in the description for ways you can support our projects. ",
