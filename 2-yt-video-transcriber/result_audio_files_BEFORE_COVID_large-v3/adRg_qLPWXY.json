            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Jerusalem, Israel.  Amos, Amos, chapter eight, verse 11.  Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord God, when I will send a famine on the land, not a famine of bread, nor of thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.  We're living in those times right now.  There's a hunger in Israel.  Jews and Arabs are searching for the truth.  We're living in those prophetic times.  where the hunger is rising to a new level.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  For many years, the gospel has been suppressed in Israel, but now the veil is being lifted, and Jews and Arabs are being saved like never before.  2 Chronicles 15, verse 3.  For a long time, Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law.  And the word for law there is the word Torah.  And Torah means God's instruction.  In no way does it mean to follow the rabbis or to follow man.  It means to follow Yeshua, Jesus.  He is the high priest.  especially this period of time, in the period of the feast of the Lord.  Jews are searching.  We're launching many outreach campaigns all through the land of Israel.  The only way that the hunger can be met is by calling on the name of the shepherd, calling on the name of Yeshua the Messiah, the King of kings and Lord of lords.  Psalms 23, verse 1.  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.  And we know that the shepherd is Yeshua, Jesus.  John 10, verse 14.  I am the good shepherd.  I know my own, and my own know me.  We began sharing this message all through Yerushalayim, Jerusalem.  As the team were praying, I began preaching this to many.  How Orthodox man and his son and his father were excited to read and to hear about Psalms 23, verse 1.  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.  They introduced themselves.  The Orthodox man's name was Mordechai.  His father's name was David.  And the boy's name was Roni.  They came to Jerusalem to prepare for Roni's bar mitzvah, as he was going to be bar mitzvahed next week.  Praise Yeshua.  They asked if we can read together Psalms 23, verse 1.  It was supernatural.  They were asking to read the Bible together.  We opened Psalms 23 verse 1 and read together, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.  I then asked Mordecai, Do you know who the shepherd is?  He immediately said, God.  I said, Did you know that the shepherd laid down his life for the people?  They asked, What do you mean by that?  I turned the Bible to the book of Isaiah chapter 53 and began reading.  Who has believed our message?  And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?  He grew up before him like a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground.  He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.  He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering and familiar with pain.  like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised and we held him in low esteem.  surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering.  yet we considered him punished by god stricken by him and afflicted.  But he was pierced for our transgressions.  He was crushed for our iniquities.  The punishment that brought us peace was on him.  And by his stripes we are healed.  We all like sheep have gone astray.  Each of us has turned to our own way.  And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.  So you can see that he is the shepherd and he laid down his life for us.  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.  Each of us has turned to our own way, but he bore our sins.  He is the good shepherd, and all who trust and believe in him shall not want.  It was supernatural.  The Holy Spirit was working.  They all couldn't say a word.  David, the father, was holding his head.  He couldn't believe what he was hearing, what he was seeing.  Jews don't read Isaiah 53.  It's called the forbidden chapter.  He was holding his head and saying, he couldn't move.  I've never seen anything like it.  They were all in shock.  It was time for the full gospel.  I told them, the good shepherd is Yeshua HaMashiach, Yeshua the Messiah, who died on the tree, on the cross for your sins, rose on the third day, and by his blood, if you repent and believe, you have full redemption of sins and eternal life.  He is the good shepherd who laid down his life for his people.  And the fact that you came to Jerusalem today because of your son's bar mitzvah, is not a coincidence.  God is speaking to you.  Finally, Mordechai spoke, and he said, what you're saying is not Jewish.  I asked Mordechai, did we not read from the Jewish scriptures, from the Tanakh?  He said, yes.  Did you not say that the shepherd is God?  He said, yes.  Then you've answered yourself.  It's the most Jewish message you'll ever hear.  I told them all, I pray that you'll come to know that Yeshua is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  and you will not want anymore.  The Lord is my shepherd.  I shall not want.  I gave them a CD with contact information.  We pray.  that they'll contact the ministry, have dreams, and have visions.  Isaiah 62, verse 1.  And the word in Hebrew for salvation is Jesus, Yeshua.  And it reads like this in Hebrew.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  Let's continue to stand together in prayer and work to harvest together in these end times.  Let's pray for this family and all that heard the gospel as we continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Ariah Yehudah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
