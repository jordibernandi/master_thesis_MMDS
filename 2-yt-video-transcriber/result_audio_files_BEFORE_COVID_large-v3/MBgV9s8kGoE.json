He ends up crashing and rolling his car.  And I think the guy gets away.  And the initial stop is some traffic poo-butt.  Probably, you know, his shoelaces weren't tired and he wanted to protect and serve him.  It looks like he kind of almost went off the road there and kind of ran a stop sign, but he was going to stop him before that.  So he pretty much took off.  I mean, it's pretty easy to tell when somebody's going to run.  Because they just kind of leave you, and you're like, oh shit, he's running.  Let me get my siren on.  Now I'm in a pursuit.  Let me figure out where the hell I'm at so I can call in.  Hopefully he called in the plate before.  Hopefully he got a description before.  Check where we're at.  Check where we're at on the map.  So he's talking to his partner.  Hey, check where we're at.  Or somebody in the car.  I don't know if it's his partner or if it's a ride-along.  Check where we're at on the map.  So he's trying to get his location.  So suspect's reaching his pocket and throwing things out.  Rick, maybe he just had a bad sucker and he didn't like it anymore.  Yeah, okay.  Well, most people with a freaking brain know he's dumping dope.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't mean you can kill somebody because they throw a little dope on the road.  I've chased a lot of motorcycles.  Motorcycles lose cars when they make turns and. ",
