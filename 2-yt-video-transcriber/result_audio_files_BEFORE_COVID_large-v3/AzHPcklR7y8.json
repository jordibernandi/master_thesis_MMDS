            "text": "Well, I've done all I can do.  Ex-Muslims find themselves in a unique situation, even among other apostates.  They do share many experiences with ex-Christians like myself, but they also face challenges unique to coming out of Islam specifically.  There are certain myths and lies propagated about ex-Muslims which they face constantly, and those deserve to be refuted.  Here, we'll take on four of those lies, and with each, I'll bring in a different ex-Muslim activist to share their perspective on it.  They just haven't studied ex-scholar or passage.  If you're any type of apostate, you may have heard some variation of this.  As an ex-Christian, I hear this all the time.  However, even being an activist, I can't say that this is thrown at me as often as it's thrown at many of my ex-Muslim friends.  Anyone that understands Islam fully, never, never will you leave Islam.  Never.  Wallahi billahi.  No way.  I tend to think that a reason why Muslims say this is that it allows them to maintain the belief that the more one studies Islam, the truer it appears, and no one could possibly be properly educated about Islam and then disbelieve it.  After all, if one can study Islam thoroughly and then disbelieve it, well, that might mean that Islam isn't true.  It comes off to me as a defensive move motivated by fear.  The reality is, though, that one, plenty of highly educated Muslims leave Islam, often motivated by what their high level of education tells them about it.  And two, there are plenty of good reasons to leave Islam that aren't complicated or difficult to understand.  As an atheist myself, I don't believe in Islam simply because I don't think it satisfied the burden of proof for its claim that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God in existence.  A lot of ex-Muslim atheists disbelieve for that same reason as well.  Other common, simple reasons for disbelieving Islam include it conflicts with science in positing that all of humanity came from two people, Adam and Eve.  There's no proof of its supposed miracles.  Muhammad apparently split the moon in half, but there's no evidence that that ever happened.  Islam claims to have a perfect system of morality under which everyone thrives, but the Quran endorses a man beating his wife for disobeying him.  Muhammad was supposedly the perfect moral role model, but he consummated his marriage to a nine-year-old child.  it doesn't take much to understand why all of those things are a problem for a supposedly perfect religion.  Finally, I'll have Imtiaz Shams weigh in on this, but before I do, let me remind you that many Muslims demand that all ex-Muslims have an extremely high level of education before leaving Islam, but require basically no education of new converts.  All they have to do is say they believe it, say the shahada. ",

            "text": "Something that I really hate is this idea that you have to have like a PhD and a certificate from Azhar University at Egypt to be an ex-Muslim.  It's so common and it's ridiculous because often what I'll say back to them is, okay, cool, let's talk about Mormonism.  What do you know about Mormonism?  And mostly Muslims have no clue about Mormonism, Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon.  but yet they don't believe in Mormonism.  So I always say, well, why are you not a Mormon?  And if they have any arguments, I say, well, no, you don't have a PhD in Mormonism.  So it's like people don't understand and it doesn't click in their head that leaving Islam doesn't require an in-depth knowledge base of Islam.  That said, a lot of ex-Muslims that leave actually do know a lot about Islam.  In fact, often when you speak to them, they've done more research about it than a lot of Muslims who practice.  You know, you've got Muslims who kind of like... were born into it, so they kind of practice here and there.  They do the rituals.  They don't know much about it.  They don't even speak Arabic a lot of the times.  While ex-Muslims, a lot of times, because it's something that's so big that you're leaving, you end up digging deep.  So in my case, for example, I grew up in an extremely religious environment.  I was going to mosque all the time.  I've been fasting since I was seven years old.  So it's like it was a big part of my life.  So I didn't leave it without lack of knowledge.  But that stereotype is wrong as well.  Just because someone leaves it if they don't agree with it doesn't mean they have to have a PhD in it, you know?  So I would say if that's the stereotype you have, I'd recommend either you understand that it's wrong or you do a PhD in every single religion in the world so that you can actually say that you're not a Christian or a Hindu or a Buddhist.

            "text": "they just want attention or they would leave quietly.  Apparently, true ex-Muslims would never care about speaking against Islam.  They would just leave it and never talk about it again.  After all, when your entire life is forced to radically change by a shift in your worldview, you've been taught to be paralyzed by the fear of hellfire for disbelieving, and most of your friends and family see people like you as mortal enemies, your first instinct is obviously to get over it and just move on immediately.  No, getting positive attention to stroke one's own ego is not the point of speaking out publicly for really any ex-Muslim.  People are shunned, made homeless, imprisoned, or even killed for being apostates.  There are 13 countries in the world, all Islamic, which punish apostasy by death.  It's incredibly easy to see, with the slightest bit of empathy, that ex-Muslims might have reasons for speaking out which have nothing to do with them being praised.  Many in that community want nothing but to be themselves and live.  Consider that maybe ex-Muslims speak out against Islam because they feel it oppresses women.  Maybe they speak out against it because it motivates their own families to disown them.  Maybe it's because it prompts governments to execute those who believe differently.  Maybe ex-Muslims stick together and praise each other because no one else will do that for them.  Supporting Islamic doctrine and then claiming ex-Muslims just want attention is like cheering for a family to be ripped apart and then mocking the most isolated member of that family just for trying to pick themselves up again.  Now, to give her perspective as an ex-Muslim who is charged with this accusation constantly, here's Zahra Kay. ",

I think more often we have a lot to lose than we have gained with that attention.  A lot of times our families are the ones to shun us away.  Our friends don't talk to us.  It's not the right kind of attention that we even get.  It's mostly negative.  And it's toxic, just even in the online world or even in person, people just have this vile idea of what ex-Muslims are like.  Most people when they come out, it is, to find other people like them, to find a community versus actually that attention that they get.  Sure, if I see another ex-Muslim tweeting that she's an ex-Muslim and she just came out, I'm going to go out there and celebrate and make sure she's okay because I know how hard it is.  So I guess in that way, ex-Muslims do give other ex-Muslims that attention and comfort and be their family.  For us, it's mostly about building a community and supporting each other. ",

This accusation is just slightly different from the last, but my friends and I had to include it because it's so common and so absurd.  To think that there's more money involved in being an ex-Muslim than in being an evangelist for Islam ignores clear evidence to the contrary.  The ludicrously popular Zakir Naik sells out arenas for his preaching.  He has his own TV network called Peace TV.  Even on a totally different level of exposure, the pattern is still clear.  Ali Dawah and Mohammed Hijab, both apologists and YouTubers, have run several extremely successful giving campaigns in recent years.  One example is that in a singular campaign in 2018, they raised over 25,000 British pounds for their own ministry.  In the same year, my activist friends and I, including many ex-Muslims, raised money for ex-Muslims in North America, and we raised $5,000.  Also, if I'm not mistaken, didn't both Ali Dawah and Mohammed Hijab just make multiple videos a couple months ago about a family using Islam to make money? ",
