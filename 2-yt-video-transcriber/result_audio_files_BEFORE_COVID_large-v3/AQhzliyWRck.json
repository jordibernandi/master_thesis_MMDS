            "text": "full-scale war.  Let me tell you exactly what's going on here.  This is very important for the listeners.  When Bill Barr became Attorney General, the President said, see if you can get to the bottom of what happened during the campaign.  Bill Barr tried to do that, and you will recall from his interview with Fox, he said he now had more questions than he had when he started.  Chris Wray, the current FBI Director, was stonewalling the current Attorney General, Bill Barr, on disclosure of of certain information about FBI conduct.  It got very, very heated.  And Gina Haspel, the CIA director, was also resisting disclosure of certain information.  Barr got fed up, went to the president and said, Ms.  President, I can't answer your question, and here's why.  And the president said, fine.  Twenty-four hours later, the order came out.  This is full-scale war between the Attorney General of the United States and, believe it or not, Another FBI director who thinks he's James Comey.  Christopher Wray is a disaster.  He's an unmitigated disaster.  But I want you to just think about this.  Look at two newspaper headlines.  May 24th, Washington Post.  Unease as Barr's power grows.  Carryover headline.  Current former officials fear distortion of FBI-CIA's work.  Next day, New York Times, order to review secrets pits CIA versus Justice Department.  Order to review secrets sets up power struggle.  You are watching the quintessential Washington power battle.  And here's the problem for the agencies, the FBI and the CIA.  They have one disadvantage.  They can leak information.  to the Post and the Times, but they do not have subpoena power, and Bill Barr does.  We are headed toward a gigantic, gigantic fight.  The intelligence community, which includes the FBI, is in full resistance to disclosing what they did during the presidential campaign.  But here's the other problem they have, and they're very fearful of.  The FISA court has already found that there was political spying going on starting in 2012.  Not 15, not 16, 2012.  Why was that spying going on in the Obama administration?  The FBI and the CIA desperately fear that if these disclosures become publicly known in a wide-ranging way, their powers may be cut back, Pfizer may be restricted, and some additional people may go to prison.  Christopher Wray is now standing in the way of history.  Make no mistake about it.  Christopher Wray has become an enemy of the people. ",

            "text": "It took place over a number of weeks, but the Attorney General was unable to get the information that he needed to answer the questions of the President of the United States.  Remember what this is.  This is the president of the United States asking his new attorney general with full power to find out what went on.  The FBI director is saying, no, you're not going to be able to find out all that's going on.  So that happened over a period of time, and eventually, you know, Bill Barr is a very serious lawyer.  He's not the kind of guy who loses his temper.  This was not the sort of thing where there would be a blowup.  This would be fine, Chris, if that's what you want.  I'm just telling you this is my impression from everything that I know.  I've not discussed this with Bill Barr or Christopher Wray.  But let me tell you something.  I came to Washington in 1967.  I haven't left.  I know what I know.  And what's going on now is a battle royal, not between Bill Barr and Chris Wray per se, although that is happening.  It is a fight between accountable government, between agencies that have resisted for years and succeeded in not being accountable.  They've met their match, an attorney general who not only is smart, but who used to work at the CIA, who is a litigator, and who has ace and who has subpoena power.  If these people resist, if they get to the point where they will not, for example, Listen to this.  Now, just think about this, if you will, for a minute.  The New York Times, in its story, and the Washington Post in its story, you know, going crazy over this power being devolved to bars, say that one of the things that the CIA is really worried about is that their key informant, who's very close to Vladimir Putin, may be revealed.  Okay, now, just ask yourself this question.  If you really thought that this source... was so important.  Would you tell the New York Times and the Washington Post?  Do you think that Putin and his people don't know, at this point, who that person is, since there are already stories written about it in 2018?  This is so stupid, what the agency and the FBI are doing.  They are literally at war with the President of the United States and his Attorney General.  This is unbelievable.  And, you know, I just... I tell people, read your papers carefully, and you've got to follow this.  This is as big as it gets in a democracy. ",

Joe, Sheila Jackson Lee.  during a December 2018 House Judiciary Committee hearing with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, was asked about some FISA warrants.  And she says, she talks about Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and says one thing that all of these persons had in common was that each was the subject of a FISA court investigation, which we now know, and all were directly connected to Trump.  Loretta Lynch replies, yes.  Now, we never knew that anyone other than Carter Page had FISA warrants taken out against him.  So there were four now that we know about. ",

You have Sheila Jackson Lee, who is a total idiot and who really is a very, very disturbed person.  I mean, her brain is just... But also Loretta Lynch, who could be the dumbest attorney general in the history of the United States.  Do not... What they may have been referring to unwittingly are what I just discussed.  Illegal surveillance on some of these people by these queries.  What happens is when you go into a 702 database, You get everything, phone calls, text messages, e-mails, everything.  Remember, the National Security Agency scoops up everything.  And, by the way, they have Hillary Clinton's 30,000 deleted e-mails at NSA, if anybody wants to get them.  And I'm sure that Huber and John Durham are going to get them.  Here's the deal.  We don't know if there were other FISA's.  We do know that there was extensive illegal spying by going into these databases at NSA.  What probably they're referring to is that these other people, other than Carter Page, were spied on by using NSA databases without authority, by using contractors.  By the way, Adam Schiff knows all of this.  That's why he is fighting so desperately to have everybody stop, because the great scandal is not what happened in 2016, although that is a great scandal.  It's what happened starting in 2012 when they were illegally accessing NSA data.  By the way, anybody who wants to know about this can read the FISA court opinion of April 26, 2017, in which this is all discussed.  This is not something that's a surprise to anybody.  That's what the FISA court was furious about.  That's why they reprimand.  And that's why Ash Carter and James Clapper tried to fire Mike Rogers, the head of the NSA, who discovered all of this and revealed it to the FISA court.  This is what Schiff and the Democrats are fighting against.  They fear desperately.  that what will happen is all of this illegal spying from 2012, which nobody has reported on except Marketplace and Sundance, the conservative treehouse, they will find out and it will become a much bigger story.  Now, of course, the press will be totally disinterested in this, and that's why what Barr is doing is so important, because the legal conclusions that he reaches will be history. ",
