            "text": "Shalawong.  The bonds to the apostles and the elders, salutations to all my fellow laborers.  Doing this work in truth and sincerity, risking their lives and their freedom to do so now more so than ever.  To the confusion, the face of the joint and to our ranks, to hopefully let the Akwa that are listening and learning, to you I say Shalawong.  This is your brother Malcolm from the branch of the Great Millstone here in Chicago, coming at you with a quick lesson.  And I have to be fast with it because I got to get out of here and get to the live show.  And this is a video that I came across with D.L.  Hughley, and he speaks on Mitch McCollum, which is the Edomite who said that nobody alive today had anything to do with slavery and didn't benefit from it, which is a complete and total lie.  Which he is going to point some of those things out.  And he says it so beautifully and eloquently, except for the fact when he brings up the Native Americans.  He's going off with that because the Native Americans that received all that money are not Native Americans.  Those are Edomites claiming Native American heritage through their mothers.  Your heritage is through your father.  The real Native Americans living in shit, piss, and squalor in some of the most horrific places, garbage-filled, drug-filled, drunken-filled dirt.  They don't even have running water.  and some of these reservations are indoor plumbing, man.  So he went off when he made that statement.  But to the effect that what reparations that were given to these other people and things of that nature, he was right on point.  So I'm going to open with this scripture before we play the video.  And I'm going to open with Isaiah 65 and 6.  And it reads, Behold, it was written before me, I will not keep silence.  but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom.  So it's a saying that I don't know if I'm the first person to ever say it, but I've been saying it for quite a long time.  And that saying is that manifest destiny has a part too.  They didn't read the fine print.  What they did unto us will be done unto them in double. ",

They have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.  All right, so they've done horrific things to the Lord's people, to our holy land, to our heritage.  So without any further ado, let's let Brother D.L.  Hughley speak his piece. ",

            "text": "Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, commented on reparations.  This is a big deal right now.  Everybody's talking about it.  Matter of fact, today there was a meeting on the Senate, gathered a lot of people.  He said that none of us that are currently living are responsible for slavery.  Why should we pay for something we didn't do?  Even if you didn't own slaves, you're a white man of a certain age in America, you directly benefited from it.  You probably were taught to speak or to ride a bike or how to cook.  By somebody who directly owns slaves.  You benefit.  You got a head start.  The school you went to, University of Kentucky, you got to go to school without them accepting black people.  You got a head start directly because of slavery.  The Civil War ended in 1965, 100 years after the Civil War ended.  I was born in 1965.  I'm the first one of my mother's children to be born with the full rights of an American citizen.  You, from your first breath, were an American citizen.  You got all the rights due an American citizen from the very time you were born.  If you purchase stolen goods, knowing they're stolen, they're still stolen, and if you lose those goods and no longer have them, you still have to make restitution.  You still have to pay for the stuff.  Possessing nine-tenths of the law, you still receive stolen property that you knew was stolen.  As far as I know, there's no statute of limitations on murder, which happened all the time.  And they always talk about how they hate freeloaders.  It is against the laws of finance to have profit without loss.  You can't get all the money.  Imagine how much money you would have if it was all profit.  You didn't have to pay for gas.  You didn't have to pay for living expenses.  You didn't have to pay taxes.  How much money would you have?  That's in essence what America got from having slavery.  And just because a bill doesn't come on time doesn't mean it ain't due.  You write up an American Express bill, let it be late.  Are they going to say, well, it happened a long time ago.  We're going to let that go.  That's not what happens.  And they've done it before.  This idea that it was so long ago we can't do it.  In 1982, the federal government paid $25,000 to the family of Italians who were lynched in 1891.  So you will pay lynched Italians 100 years later, but not people who were descendants of slaves.  You won't do that.  And none of those people who were lynched were there.  And none of the people who wrote the checks to them actually perpetrated the crime.  They were the descendants of those people.  And you paid them.  You paid Japanese internment camps.  Each survivor got $25,000.  Reagan did that.  The Native Americans got $1.3 billion after World War II.  So the national debt right now, as it stands, is $22 billion.  And we also rebuild countries that we've ruined.  We've ruined those countries.  We've run up a tab to our national debt by fixing the countries that we've damaged.  So there's a national debt clap you see right now.  It says that every American family owes almost a million dollars.  Now, who's going to pay for that?  A million dollars.  You know, actually, I was born paying for stuff that I never had, that I never was a recipient of.  Social Security works that way.  So you get to decide.  your argument is just because I didn't do it.  I wasn't there.  I shouldn't pay for it.  This country got rich and received recompense by brutalizing people.  And it's amazing.  It's amazing.  The very people right now will build monuments acknowledging slavery.  Confederate statues acknowledge this.  But they do not want to deal with the repercussions of it.  If you don't have the money, that's fine.  Do what we do.  Put a little something on it.  You don't have to give people 40 eggs at a meal.  I know that's impossible.  You can send people to school.  You can forgive debt.  You can give no interest loans.  There are a lot of things you can do to make things right.  Not because you owe, but because it's the right thing to do.  You said yesterday, you said, why should I pay for sins I haven't committed?  But you are the same people that go ask what would Jesus do?  Isn't that what the guy that you always wear those bands and expounds his name would do?  He paid for sins he didn't commit. ",

            "text": "So let me correct myself.  But there is a recompense.  This is Galatians 6 and 7 and it reads, Be not deceived.  God is not mocked.  For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.  So Esau Edom, the pale man, the red pale man cursed in the Bible, is going to pay.  This is Colossians 3 and 25.  But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done.  And there is no respect of persons.  All right.  So if the Israelites can have to pay for what they did, how much more the heathen, how much more Esau, Edom.  One last scripture.  This is Revelation 18 and 6.  And it reads, reward her even as she rewarded you, and doubled unto her according to her works.  And a cup which she hath filled, filled unto her double. ",
