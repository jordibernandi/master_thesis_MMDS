But what Nietzsche meant by his statement, God is dead, is that the Enlightenment period had eliminated any kind of possibility for God to exist.  Of course, not everything that happened in the Enlightenment period was awesome, but what he's referencing here is the blossoming of scientific knowledge during that time.  I don't think that the possibility of God has been totally negated by science, but I can see how it would seem that way at the time.  Things that were once considered supernatural have now been explained by natural processes.  We were beginning to figure out how reality actually works without just attributing it to God.  While I understand why Nietzsche would have felt this way, I don't think that science necessarily rules out the possibility of God.  More specifically a deistic god which is a product of the enlightenment period. ",

You see, the scientific process understands that humans can be wrong, and therefore there's a rigorous method that the ideas are put through in order to verify that they represent reality.  The scientific method has a self-correcting mechanism that's built into it for those particular situations where we are wrong.  Religion doesn't have anything like that.  In fact, whole wars and millions of people are killed over the disagreements between religious doctrine.  You not only see one religion fighting another religion, but also internally to a single religion.  you have infighting there as well.  In America today, you see a great divide in the Christian community itself.  You have conservative Christians on one hand that are young earth creationists that literally believe the Bible and everything like that.  Then you have the more progressive side of Christianity that, you know, doesn't try to explain scientific questions with the Bible.  So we have this theological battle as well.  But all in all, God is defined as a supernatural entity that exists outside of reality.  While Cameron over at Capturing Christianity doesn't understand what is meant by the natural world, most people understand that the reality that we experience is considered the natural world.  Whole arguments are developed with God existing outside of this reality or the natural world in order to have the effect that he does on it.  That would be creating it in general as well as violating the natural laws in order to impose his will upon that reality.  And you see, science can only describe what we experience in this natural world.  So I don't think that science will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of a god or gods.  What it can do, though, is disprove specific definitions of God, like the Islamic definition, the Christian definition, the Jewish definition, or even the Hindu definition of what God is, thus making those particular definitions of God dead.

The insinuation that he's making here, of course, is that God is cleaning the natural world, or God is responsible for keeping the natural world in its natural state.  But all this boils down to the fact that if we have a natural explanation for something, then we don't need a supernatural or a God explanation in order to explain why it happens.  Microorganisms like bacteria, as well as plants, fungi, and even other animals clean up the dead organic matter that eventually comes to exist in the natural world.  You see, the microorganisms would break down this dead organic matter into more simple molecules.  And these molecules would benefit the area surrounding wherever that particular dead organic matter is.  So, my question is, does God control these microorganisms?  I mean, why conflate your God with the natural order of the universe like this?  I mean, you're just ad hoc inserting God into the explanation that doesn't need further explanation.
