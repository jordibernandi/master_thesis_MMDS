            "text": "Black Ram 313 back at it again, you know why?  It's because this is therapeutic, man.  Back again with another video, hence another therapy session.  Today's topic and title is can guys hit the wall?  Jumping right into the subject matter at hand, let's go.  I did a video a little while back called still single after 30 the wall.  and in that video i discussed the phenomenon of the wall as it relates to the female.  now i had many ladies in the comments section making the claim that men hit the wall too.  And of course, there was no argument made by the ladies to support their wild claim.  And I am not surprised.  And as we know, when a woman becomes an adult, her SMV starts out very high, shoots off like a rocket.  And then as fast as that SMV shoots up, it starts its descent in which we call the wall.  And at 40, she is not as attractive as she once was, nor as desirable as she once was at age 20.  Now, when it comes to men, we are not the same.  This should not alarm you.  This should be obvious, but not so obvious to the succubus and the simp.  So let's get into five reasons why men do not, why men cannot hit the wall.  Number one.  A guy doesn't even really get started until later on in his life.  His SMV begins around 26 or so.  Females often report that men are more attractive as they age.  For the man, women find attractive a 30 year old instead of the 20 year old.  And in many cases, the 40 year old as opposed to the 30 year old.  Don't believe me.  Ask a woman if Idris Elba is more or less attractive now that he was 10 or 15 years ago.  Ask her is Will Smith.  Less attractive now or more attractive at his current age?  Actor Sean Connery was voted most attractive man of the year at age 59.  And most men who receive such acknowledgement are usually 45 and up.  The fact is that for women, men are physically more attractive as they age, unlike the female who looks deteriorate rapidly.  Ask a man if they want the 40 plus Halle Berry.  Well, the 20 something Howdy Berry, which ones or which one would they prefer?  Again, this is about attraction.  What's attractive to him is not necessarily what's attractive to her.  We are different for the female.  The older, mature, physically developed male is more attractive than the lesser developed physically male.  A man to the female is more attractive at 30 and 40 than he is around 20 when he's still maturing, still developing.  But for the female again, youth is beautiful.  Age is less so.  Number two, as to the reason why men do not hit the wall.  It's because as a man ages, not only does he look better, but he begins to make more money.  What is hypergamy?  It is a foundation of female nature, isn't it?  As he ages, he makes more.  He may be able to save more, invest more, becomes more savings and investment oriented.  Maybe a job promotion.  Maybe his business is doing better.  Typically, as a man ages and matures, his pockets tend to have more cash in them.  And she loves a man who has money, right?  Of course, this is the definition of hypergamy.  Number three, as to the reason why men do not, cannot, will not hit the wall.  is because older in some cases means more knowledge, more wisdom, more confidence, more gain.  These things make him more masculine and dominant in her sight.  Most men are different, better, and wiser as they age.  I'm a much better man in my 40s than I was in my 30s.  She sees this.  She understands this.  Thus, she is more attracted to such.  Unlike the female who is the same age mentally at 45 as she was at 25 and the same age mentally at 25 as she was at age 12.  As a guy, in most cases, well, I should say in some cases, as he ages, he comes into a sense of self, knowing himself, understanding himself, becoming more confident in himself, the knowledge of self.  This is attractive to him.  However, she's just as lost at age 40 as she was at age 18.  Therefore, maturity doesn't play the role and doesn't come into factor as his maturity does, because we know the creature does not mature.  Her options just change.  Number four.  As a man ages, he gains more life experience, more experience with women in particular.  This is very appealing to the female, especially in the area of intimacy.  She wants a guy that knows what he's doing.  And every man knows that he's gained more skills at 30 than when he was 20.  She desires experience and values it.  None will deny this.  Listen up.  A key point here.  The more partner a man has had, builds experience and confidence, making him a better lover.  For her, the opposite is true.  More partners equals more damage.  Damaged goods for us as men is undesirable.  An experience for her, experience in a man, is much to be desired.  Remember again, We are different.  You enter her.  She does not enter you.  She receives your spirit.  You do not receive hers.  You implant and she receives.  This should be common sense.  However, we know that common sense isn't so common today.  Boys and girls are different.  So again, no wall for men.  More experience is good.  To please her.  It works in her favor.  But when she has experience, it is an accelerator towards the wall.  More bodies, more guys, the more experience she has, the more damage.  Men, do you want an experienced carousel rider?  Of course, the answer is no.  Women, do you want a guy who does not know what he's doing?  Bang!  Because you want a guy who knows what he's doing and the only way that he'll know what he's doing is through experience.  Again, ladies, we are not the same.  And you do not want the same thing in men as is expected of you yourself.  And if you deny such, it's only because you are a liar.  Number five, as to the reason that men do not hit the wall.  Number five.  And number five, it's because a man is the grand prize.  The grand prize game, I would like to say.  As Rolo Tomasi says, he doesn't have game.  He is the game.  or at least for some, you have the potential to be so.  A man in his forties and his fifties, who's in shape, and have his life together is at his peak.  He is sought out after by younger and older women.  Older means he looks better.  Older means he has more money.  Older means that he is wiser and experienced.  Therefore, he is the grand prize.  Starting out from about 30 years old, To about 65 years old, he only gets better.  Rare is it to see a young man with an over 60 year old woman.  But you will see the 20 year old and the 30 year old ladies with the guy that's 60 plus.  Tell me this is not true.  Tell me where the light.  Men age like fine wine, but she ages like milk.  She starts to smell and get clumpy and is no longer fit for consumption.  She starts out great at age 18, but goes down a very slippery slope fast by age 27 and crashes head on by 31 or so.  Don't believe me?  Ask to see a 30 year old woman's senior high school yearbook picture when she was 18.  And check to see if she looks even half as good at 30 than she did at 18.  And by the time she's 40. hardly even recognizable from the woman that she once was.  Now, is that desirable?  Is a 20 row smiling face beautiful?  Yes.  Is a 30 year old smiling face beautiful?  Yes.  But the 30 year old smiling face is not as bright as the 20 year old smiling face.  These are facts.  This is how men perceive things.  But women, you all perceive things differently.  A man with age in his face, with a little gray in his beard, with a little bit more confidence in his walk, a little bit more money in his pocket that he gained through age and experience is more attractive to you.  And not the same is true for the male and his attraction to the female.  Elementary, my friends, common sense.  But common sense, again, is not so common in this kind of centric society in which we now live.  Your mind is backward.  You cannot see reality for what it is.  So there is no wall for men.  As a man, he can produce children from puberty until death.  Women have a small window of about 30 to 35 years maximum to produce a limited amount of children.  Because she's born with all the eggs that she will ever have.  There are no new eggs generated and made within her body.  A man has a lifetime to produce children about 70 to 80 years.  To produce offspring, he has no limit per se, as his body is constantly producing seed.  It is a seed producing factory.  Hers is an egg holding factory, no production done there.  With enough fertile women to go around, one man can literally produce thousands and populate a small city in his lifetime.  This is why monogamy is a ridiculous concept and notion for men being stuck with one aging woman for a lifetime.  Again, no offer.  Men, his value on the dating market can only increase as he gets older, more wiser, gains more knowledge through experience, more skill through experience, more wisdom through experience, more game through experience, more money through experience.  He can only win and win more.  But for her, It's best that she gets her mind right and find her a husband as early as possible, as young as possible.  Because as she gets older, doesn't look good.  Experience for her is yuck.  Experience for him is yay.  Understand that we are not the same.  And I doubt if any synth or succubus can debate this point.  I doubt if you can come up with a reasonable objection to the things that has been stated here.  And if you can, I challenge you to do so.  But I know you can't and you will not.  Therefore, you'll keep your words to yourself.  And if you decide to say something, it'll be something nonsensical.  Like the video.  Subscribe to the channel.
