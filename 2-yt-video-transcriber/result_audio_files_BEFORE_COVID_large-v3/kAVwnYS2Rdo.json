            "text": "Well, Colin Kaepernick proves once and for all he is a fraud this weekend.  And the NFL proves again that they are virtue signaling suckers.  After three years of whining about being cut from NFL teams and suing the NFL for collusion against him, Kaepernick finally got the opportunity of a lifetime that thousands of athletes dream about but few actually achieve.  The chance to work out in front of 20 NFL teams.  And then Colin Kaepernick botched it up by being a diva.  Because Kaepernick does not actually care about NFL football.  He only cares about exploiting the NFL to build him a resistance soapbox.  I mean, you want to talk about discrimination and privilege?  This is a guy who claims he is underprivileged, who went to a private school, was adopted by an upper middle class family, who went to college on scholarship to play sports, earned millions of dollars in the NFL playing professional football, and scored a coveted Nike ad campaign after he disrespected the men and women who come home draped in the American flag by kneeling against the flag during the national anthem.  And now this.  Again, talk about privileged.  What other player gets a mid-season workout, just him, nobody else, with 20 NFL teams who agree to come watch him after he's arguably cost the NFL millions and millions and millions of dollars with his national anthem kneeling that upset fans and drove many patriotic Americans away from watching football?  This guy.  This guy got a private workout showcase for NFL teams.  And then three hours before the workout, he changed the location.  The Falcon Stadium wasn't good enough anymore.  He moved the workout to a high school 60 miles away.  He wouldn't sign a waiver.  that said if he gets injured in this practice, the NFL doesn't have to pay him workers comp for life.  The NFL was going to tape the workout and give him the tapes, but nope.  Kaepernick wanted his own camera, maybe for a new Nike commercial.  He wanted his own receivers, too.  And instead of normal workout clothes, Kaepernick wore a politically charged T-shirt bearing the name of a fictional character who was a slave who was tortured because he refused to acquiesce to the demands of his masters.  Do you get the correlation?  Of all the insulting, despicable, false accusations, to paint himself as a victim equal to a slave and the NFL as slaveholders?  But hold your sympathy for the NFL.  This is what happens when you make exceptions for whiners when you reward whiners.  So let's get one thing straight tonight.  If Colin Kaepernick wanted to play in the NFL, he would have played football this weekend.  But instead, Kaepernick chose to be woke. ",
