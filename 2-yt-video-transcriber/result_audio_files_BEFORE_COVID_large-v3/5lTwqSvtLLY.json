            "text": "Welcome back everyone, you're here with Goldberg and today I want to talk about inflation.  I want to say quickly, I think most people are reactionaries when it comes to their political views, regardless of where they might stand.  They want some centralized federal response to every issue, particularly if the economy isn't doing well.  Back in the day, if you had a shortage of resources, you were suffering financially, you would steal yourselves and go pillage or plunder another group.  Then we said, modernity hit.  Oh, that's unacceptable.  You can't do that.  You need a UN resolution, or they have to have WMDs, or they have to be killing children in order to justify military engagement.  Then you're fine.  Well, with an economic downturn, we hear this logic where it's not acceptable.  We have to always have the Keynesian constantly okay growing economy.  So the economy is sluggish now.  We can't have a boom and bust cycle.  We can't have a regular functioning market.  No, we have to inject money at some form.  So that would be like quantitative easing, right or left, the bailout of Wall Street, the bailout of the auto market.  industry the stimulus package and now if you believe in humanity first it has to be a thousand dollar a month.  paycheck to everyone.  so you raise concerns and say inflation they'll say stop being hysterical.  we don't have inflation.  reference paul kregman.  and i tried referencing paul kregman but i guess his ip address is blocked right now.  a bit of a shame there and i understand you know people went to government funded schools.  they think of inflation as i have a wheelbarrow of dollar bills to buy a loaf of bread and if they don't see that means there's no inflation.  so let's not call it inflation because a lot of these people are semantic warriors.  they spend their days filleting individual words and adjectives and verbs.  we won't even bother with that.  we'll just call it like changes in price and cost to make it simpler.  i also want to note real quick.  they will try to deflect this and say if you raise taxes there's no inflation.  this is a very questionable argument because for one you're assuming you're always going to raise the same amount of tax to cover what you're spending and that can fluctuate and you may in fact end up.  the individual may end up paying the tax.  usually that's what occurs when you tax businesses.  even if it is a sales tax or a value-added tax you end up having the costs passed on to you.  but even if we assume that's not the case On a budgetary scale, the United States has so many outlays and so little money coming in that where exactly is the argument that you're going to cover this with taxes on the broader scale?  Because it's like with Medicare.  They said, well, these taxes will fund it, and it's only going to cost, I think it was $100 billion.  between now and the 90s.  And today it costs in less than a year.  what they were projecting would cost the entire program over 30 or 40 years.  So I don't believe politicians.  I don't care how much they're down to earth or they don't wear a necktie.  I just don't trust these people because governments are really bad at projecting anything accurately.  That leads to the next point of why you don't really see inflation.  They don't accurately report inflation.  They're kind of tricky and sneaky, and it plays into other things they're trying to do with particular programs.  Furthermore, we have a massive global military presence that does prop up our currency.  If we were Argentina, do you think people would be adopting our currency like some countries have done?  No.  The fact that you can be like, hey girl, I could be there in 20 minutes and ruin his life, that helps a great deal.  Now, if our military power substantially diminishes and we don't get our financial house in order, yes, we will likely end up defaulting or collapsing.  There's no exaggeration there.  It's just the fact that, yeah, if you have a lot of military might, you're able to dismiss concerns of financial instability, at least in the medium term.  That being said, Inflation is very real.  Just because you don't see it, it certainly has affected you.  So I'll give you a little bit of a homework assignment.  Ah, forget about it.  That's what hipsters do.  I tend to read books.  I know it's kind of edgy and no one really likes it.  Stop being a gold-medal, all-purpose faggot.  Alright, so you go back and read the book Pet Sematary.  It came out in 1983.  It's about this doctor dude, I think he's an ER doctor, married to a Care Bear woman and they move out to the country.  They buy this house.  They've got their little boy that they let play by the highway where you have these tractor trailers roaring by.  And they're in the house.  Meanwhile, they're like, eh, we're kind of turned on.  Maybe we should have another kid that we can lead by the railroad tracks.  And he says something to the tune of, how do you like being with your $60,000 a year man?  And you're looking at this and you think he's an ER doctor.  Why is he making only $60,000?  Well, because the purchasing power of $60,000 in 1983 was roughly $150,000 in today's money.  $60,000 is what someone coming out of a flagship state school who does good networking might get as a starting salary.  That is a tremendous change in less than 40 years.  on how much purchasing power money has.  So, oh, that's not really inflation.  Well, it absolutely is affecting people.  And it's not just on the money side, mind you.  What's another thing you could look at?  College tuition.  I wish I could find the article.  I know I have it somewhere, but I did this when I was in college, and I was just focusing on my school, okay?  My school is a public flagship university.  From the 70s to the early 2010s, the cost of tuition had gone up like a little under 600%.  This is why we think of those memes of the boomer, well, I just got a part-time job and pay for college.  Exactly.  How do you explain that?  Well, there's different factors.  It's not just one.  Part of it is the fact that you had the government getting involved in guaranteeing payments to schools which meant they had no incentive to actually drop costs because the government's going to cover through loans and grants a certain amount.  why would you make your tuition equal to that?  okay you're going to say no we're going to make it higher so we can profit.  also states creating these arbitrary lines on the basis of like who gets charged in-state out-state tuition That's another thing that helped the cost skyrocket.  And then also allowing in a bunch of foreign students at out-of-state rates.  So there's a lot of different factors.  Companies assuming that they need this professionalized workforce.  We want people with a degree, but we don't want to pay for it.  Lots of different factors have inflated the cost.  But obviously, tuition is extremely expensive.  And you would argue why, especially for liberal arts.  Why would you have to pay $50,000 for a liberal arts degree?  but that's what you have to pay, if not more.  So yes, price inflation, changes to cost absolutely happen, and you'd be naive if you ignore that.  Another aspect would be home prices, actually.  So I was looking, this is not New York City, this is just outside of a city that I'm close to.  35, 45 minute drive, so not even like right there, maybe a little bit faster if you're on the subway.  This is a one bedroom, like 650 square foot condo, so about the size of a small one-bedroom apartment.  Extremely high, expensive monthly fees on top of your mortgage, $108,000.  That was on the low end.  Now, how do you justify that?  Well, because there's jobs there?  Yeah, but these jobs aren't paying that much.  And that's an extremely expensive proposition.  Of course, you can't even rent out a room because you only got one, so you legally are unable to perform that little scheme.  Why are house prices so high?  I would argue that the rapid and easy access to credit, which is something that both the left and right is guilty of, because the right's like, it's going to stimulate the economy, and the left's like, well, you know, it's racist and discriminatory if a so-and-so person can't have a large house because it's, you know, class war differences.  It's not fair.  Well, there again, okay, back in the day, I think it was like the 1950s, you had to put down 50% on a mortgage.  Why?  Because they wanted to show that you could definitely pay it.  Now you went to 20%, now you only have to put down 5% or no money down.  Don't you think that's going to cause companies to say, well, we might as well.  If they're only putting down 5%, we might as well increase the price of the house.  Interest rates also play into this.  I was speaking to my realtor, and she said when she bought her first house, the interest rate was 16.5%, which was considered a good deal.  Now you say, well, that's crazy.  Well, yeah, but it's meant to not just promote responsible borrowing, but also responsible saving.  And that's why these programs that are being put forward by people, they totally miss the goal.  Our objective, if you really want to help poor people, should be to look at the value of money.  To look at the fact that we've abandoned sound money principles and we've faced all these problems since then.  Not having our currency supported with something that holds real value, the gold standard or something else.  Keeping interest rates ridiculously low.  which you say, yeah, that's good for the economy.  What that actually does is it encourages everyone, including poor people who can't afford, to buy stuff that they shouldn't.  And, of course, it de-incentivizes saving because if you had higher interest rates, you could put money in the bank and you could actually generate a decent amount.  You wouldn't have to rely on the fluctuations of the stock market to the same extent.  So, yes, we do have inflation.  And, yes, the government plays a role.  It's not the only issue.  party in this whole dispute, but it's absolutely taking part.  So if you really want to help poor people, instead of like we need to spend more money, you need to look at the underlying problems of our currency, of how we dole out.  Are we printing money to inject into the economy?  Are we constantly trying to put in stimulus?  We don't like the results.  it's not organic growth which is why if you look at even like the stock market today a lot of these companies their profits aren't necessarily going up.  they're finding excuses for it.  the modern economy is about people trying to create illusions and so on the one hand it's like well if we have this we have this stimulus in the economy it'll help.  or if we give everyone money every month it'll help stimulate the economy more.  in fact the same people who complain about soul-sucking consumer capitalism destroying us and alienating us.  Then they're like, oh, give everyone $1,000 a month so they go out and consume in the consumer capitalist economy.  This is the silliness of economic policy, whether it's right-wing or left-wing.  So you have to acknowledge the core problem, which is inflation.  Just because you don't see it directly, just because you don't call that inflation, does not mean it is failing to affect your checkbook and your livelihood.  We have to be real about that because inflation Over time, it's like, okay, and just going back real quick to the question of how the government tracks it, this is why Social Security, for instance, is a massive deception.  Yes, they say we do index your historical earnings, but they're not indexing it properly, which is why If someone was making their first salary back in the day was like $1,500 a year, they're not indexing that accurately according to purchasing power.  And so that person is not really getting paid through Social Security what they were earning as far as purchasing power is concerned.  If that were the case, if they were accurately measuring inflation, What would happen is Social Security would already be long since bankrupt.  A lot of other programs would be long since bankrupt.  Yes, inflation is real.  Stop putting your head in the sand just because you want more money from the government and start acknowledging that if you want to spend more, which, okay, you want to spend more, you have to start cutting.  Otherwise, yes, the cycle continues, people will continue getting poorer, and you'll sit there saying, well, we need another government program, or we need this stimulus, we need to bail out this.  That is not the answer.  The answer is to look at the heart of money. ",
