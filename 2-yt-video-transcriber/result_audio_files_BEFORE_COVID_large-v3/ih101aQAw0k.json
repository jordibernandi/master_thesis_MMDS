            "text": "The Book of Sirach, Chapter 2.  My child, if you're going to be Yah's servant, be ready to be tested.  Make sure your heart is in the right place and endure the tests.  Don't be hasty when difficult times come.  Don't abandon Yah, instead cling to Him so that you may be honored in your last days.  Accept whatever happens to you and be patient in times of humiliation.  Gold is tested in fire and those who are found acceptable are tested in a furnace of humiliation.  Trust Yah and He will help you.  Follow Yah's straight paths and have confidence in Him.  You people who fear Yah should wait for His mercy.  Do not stray, or else you may fall.  You people who fear Yah should trust Him, and you won't lose your reward.  You people who fear Yah should hope for good things, for everlasting joy and mercy.  Look at previous generations and consider this.  Has anyone ever trusted Yah and been disappointed by Him?  Has anyone ever feared Yah and been abandoned by Him?  Has anyone ever feared Yah and been rejected by Him?  Yah is compassionate and merciful.  He forgives sins and He saves people in times of distress.  How horrible it will be for cowards, for those who give up and for sinners who lead double lives.  How horrible it will be for those who give up because they don't believe.  They won't have any protection.  How horrible it will be for you people who have lost hope.  What will you do when Yah appears?  You people who fear YAH should obey his words.  You who love him should follow his ways.  You people who fear YAH should do your best to please him.  You who love him should be devoted to his teachings.  You people who fear YAH should get ready to humble yourselves in his presence.  Let us fall into YAH's hands, but not into human hands because YAH's mercy is as great as his majesty. ",
