            "text": "hello.  all welcome to the truth show.  and here we are with another video and in this video i will be talking about angela bassett.  who is she beyond the hollywood veil?  here we go again.  oh and there's more.  oh i've not done it.  oh and there's more.  oh i've not done it.  i mean this is a truth show.  oh yes Angela Evelyn Bassett was born on August 16, 1958, in New York, but raised in Harlem.  She's the daughter of Betty Jane and Daniel Benjamin Bassett.  As many Black people, her last name came from a slave owner.  Bassett also has a sister named Danette, whom she got separated from due to finances.  She moved in with her aunt, who just loved children.  However, after her parents separated, they moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and to St.  Petersburg, Florida, where she was reunited with her sister, Danette, where she was also raised by their social worker slash civil servant mother.  Meanwhile, Angela didn't see her father until her grandmother's funeral.  and also learning that he had other children whom was older than she was.  After her grandmother died, her mother became very involved in her daughter's schooling.  She was adamant for her daughters to go to college, even though at the time certain schools were segregated.  However, at the time, Angela and her sister were in love with the Jackson Five, like who wasn't?  and like many girls did at the age they tried to mimic the group by putting on shows and read poems you know stuff like that so on and so forth for the family.  meanwhile bassett became a cheerleader at her boca ciega high school.  she also later became a member of the upward bound college prep program and the debate team and student government and the drama club and the choir.  she was also an age straight an A, B, and student.  That means she earned straight A's and B's in school, for the most part anyway.  But she did get her first C in physical education and tried to get her mother to not feel disappointed in the grade upon explaining to her mom that the grade was average, but also leading her mother to say that she did not have average kids.  As Bassett described, a sense of pride developed in her and she did not get another C until college.  Oh, yes.  Oh, that discipline led her to become the first African-American from Boca Siega to be admitted to the National Honor Society.  While she also was an upper bound, she participated in academic and cultural enrichment programs for underprivileged students.  Bassett says she and the other participant did not see themselves as unprivileged though.  After that she received her BA in 1980 at Yale University in African American Studies and then she later earned a Master in Fine Arts from Yale School of Drama.  But believe it or not Bassett's sister thought she was wasting her time getting that degree in arts considering she was the only one in the family to go to graduate college.  In Yale, in the drama department is where she met Courtney B. Vance.  They dated for a long time before getting married.  After college, she worked as a receptionist for a beauty salon and as a photo researcher.  Meanwhile, she started looking for acting jobs in the New York theater.  One of her first was in New York, a performance came in 1985 when she appeared in j.e franklin's black girl at second stage theater.  she appeared in many more thereafter.  one of her iconic roles was in what's love got to do with it where she played tina turner.  she also played in many more strong black roles pretty much throughout her entire career.  she also won plenty awards and so on and so forth with her many career endeavors.  let's get personal.  Okay, Bassett buried actor Courtney B. Vance in 1997.  They tried many years to have kids, but due to their careers, allegedly, and the fact that she really couldn't carry a child full term, allegedly, and et cetera, it didn't work out so well.  And they ended up hiring a surrogate.  And they had twins that were born on January 27, 2006.  She was 48 years old at this time.  I did hear on the streets that her husband, Courtney, did cheat a couple of times and that they had separated because of it, you know, one time or another.  But this is all alleged and it hasn't been proven and I doubt if she ever admitted anyway.  Aside from that, there aren't anything really bad to say about her and their relationship, marriage, or whatever.  But I must say, she has been true to her color, whether it's genuine or just what's on her resume.  But it's clear she's true to her ethnicity.  I mean, she hasn't dyed her hair blonde or rendered to the ideal image of what Hollywood expects and mostly accepts.  Whether you're black or not, people who aren't that image have to work extra hard to make it in Hollywood.  Just ask Angelina Jolie, Jessica Alba, Jennifer Aniston, and Tia Loni, who both upon dying their hair blonde is when their career really took off.  So it's not just blacks, it's all races, women in general.  I'm just glad Angela didn't give in to that temptation.  Also, I want to say I almost did myself, you know, I almost did that.  I really, really did.  I tried, I dyed my hair blonde.  I was doing a whole blonde hair thing because people say my complexion, blonde hair is really good for my complexion.  Until one day I looked in the mirror and I was like, the hell am i doing?  i feel so fake.  i felt like i was ashamed of my hair color and race.  i mean no offense to the blonde heads out there.  hey how y'all doing do your thing.  but me in general i love my hair color whether it's straight curly thick or whatever.  i would never subjectify myself to the pressures of what the world sees as beautiful.  You all are beautiful in your own skin.  Just remove that filter, lens, and veil and really take a look.  So with that being said, tell me your thoughts below.
