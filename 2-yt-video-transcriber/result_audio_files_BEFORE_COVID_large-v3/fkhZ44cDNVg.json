            "text": "Hey guys, it's your old pal, C-N-B-L, here.  And I've got a question for you.  Yes, you.  Are you a white, cisgender, straight, non-Jewish, American-born male?  And do you want to feel oppressed, but you aren't non-white, you aren't female, you aren't Jewish, you aren't an immigrant, and you aren't transgender?  Is going out shopping and not finding the video game you want?  just not enough anymore?  Well, now you can feed off of the unspeakable oppression that Irish men, women, and children had to face so that you can finally feel oppressed again.  Well, well, I'm a gamer, and sometimes I'm told that it's wrong to harass female video game players for being female, so I'm just as oppressed as Jews in the 1940s.  So, the story of Irish persecution begins 10,000 years ago, when Irish civilization was formed in, where else but Ireland.  Thanks for clarifying that.  I thought that Irish civilization would have been founded in Canada.  Thanks for clarifying that, you degenerate numbskull.  Oh, yeah?  Well, shut up.  Anyways, 8,000 years later, which is around 2,000 years ago today, Roman immigrants began moving to Ireland.  And while they were in Ireland, they would begin exiling Irish religious leaders, which were called Druids.  And this was only the beginning of a long, long, really, really long persecution period for just about anyone from Ireland.  So after the Romans came to Ireland and exiled Druids, which were the Irish religious leaders, eventually Vikings came to Ireland.  And while usually Vikings would just raid an island for all its gold and other treasures and then leave, for some reason, the Vikings really hated Irish culture.  And so they destroyed a bunch of monuments and landmarks important in Irish culture.  Again, for no other reason other than they hated Irish culture.  Um, then after the Vikings came and did their own little persecution towards the Irish people, um, a tribe called the Normans in 1169, ha ha ha 69, um, raided the island and took it under their control.  And it wasn't until, and I kid you not, the 20th century that Ireland was finally free from Norman control.  And then around 500 years after the Norman occupation began of Ireland, Oliver Cromwell, who was the leader of England at the time that this happened, carried out a military raid of Ireland.  So another raid.  where most Irish people were either left dead or starving.  So it was pretty much like a proto-Holocaust, except instead of Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, blacks, gays, et cetera, it was merely just Irelanders.  And then after this, again, Irelanders were left starving and homeless and most of them just dead.  The survivors had to resort to begging and stealing to feed themselves and their families.  And, um, throughout the 17 and 18 hundreds, Irelanders began immigrating to other nations.  And like just about every other group, they were accepted.  They weren't accepted at first, but eventually they were, and now they're accepted just like everyone else.  Man, I don't know what these Irish people had to complain about.  Like, sometimes I'd drop my AirPods and, like, Jesus Christ, dude, I'd drop my AirPods.  All you had to do was, like, starve and beg for a living.  My God.  Jesus Christ, Benga.  Now, I would like to touch on that, actually.  So, if you're a spoiled, gross, filthy rich kid who gets absurd amounts of money from Mommy and Daddy for Christmas and birthdays, next time you... I don't know.  Forget your AirPods before you go to your beach house or the mall.  Or don't get the new iPhone for Christmas.  Just remember what the Irish people had to go through.  And I think you'll feel very lucky.  And maybe people will hate you less because maybe you'll become less of an arrogant moron.  I'm just saying. ",
