I didn't even think it was that big of a story, which is why I didn't cover it yesterday.  But now it's like blown up.  So I'm going to cover this.  But I also want to show you other reactions, including from people like Anandji Rudardas and from Megan McCain of The View, to give you sort of a well-rounded picture on how people are responding to this and really, I guess, what this signals in terms of how society operates.  So first, here's the headline.  Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are among dozens charged in a massive college admissions scam.  The scheme involved facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and bribing administrators to designate students as athletic recruits.  Now, as I was saying, my first reaction was, yeah.  Of course.  I mean, this is obviously happening.  Why is this a big deal?  But I guess the reason this is sort of a big deal is because they were actually caught and charged and arrested.  So that's not what usually happens.  And look.  What they did was illegal, which is also different.  So, society is already rigged legally in favor of the wealthy.  But this was illegal rigging.  So, that's why this is a bigger deal, I guess, in terms of the way the media views it than the normal rigging that is legal.  But again, to me, it's all just rigging.  So, I don't... I understand the difference in terms of the law, but in terms of its actual effect on society, it's the same.  Now, I want to go, let me just quickly go over some of the details of this story, and then I'll show you some of the reactions that really interest me most.  So this is from Splinter News.  U.S.  Attorney Andrew Lelling called the parents' charge in the case a catalog of wealth and privilege.  The schemes involved paying better students to take the SAT or ACT on the rich kid's behalf, straight up changing answers on the test after the kids took them, having therapists help them get extra time on their exams, and even bribing university athletics coaches to pretend the students were athletic recruits.  Many of the students were unaware their parents were cheating on the tests for them, the FBI said.  The payments were made through a non-profit and disguised as charitable donations.  According to the FBI, some parents paid up to $6.5 million for guaranteed admission to colleges.  Now, the focus of this story has largely been on the two big actresses who got caught up in this.  But I want to show you a clip here from Anand Giridharadas on MSNBC discussing where the real focus should be. ",

Yes, they have, you know, general power in society because of their wealth.  But people like Bill McGlashan, who have actual power, Who are the ones turning the knobs?  Who are the people trying to distract us away from the issues that capitalism creates and say, no, look, we have our foundations.  We're doing all these great things.  Billionaires are actually really helping the world.  So no, don't tax us more.  Don't take our power away.  Allow us to fix the problems of society that ultimately we created.  But we're not going to say that.  But allow us to control it all.  And no, don't tax me more.  Don't take my power away.  I'm fine.  That's what people like Bill McGlashan do.  And then behind the scenes, the people that he's pretending to empower, he is taking their power away by getting his kid in illegally to the detriment of everybody else that is trying to get into that same school.  So... This shows you, ultimately, not only that this was clearly illegal and a problem in itself, this case here, but also just generally on society and how people like Bill McGlashan and how they approach society and how they always think.  no matter what part of their life it is, whether it's themselves, their kids, their money, they always find a way.  to create this system where they are able to benefit to the detriment of everybody else.  Even if it means creating this entire facade around, oh, don't worry, we are conscious capitalists.  We are thinking about the world and helping people.  When in reality, all the things that they do with their foundations is ultimately to benefit them, to make connections for themselves, and even behind the scenes, the things they do to get their kids into college.  Now, I want to show this clip from... the view.  So we got Meghan McCain.  I just feel like I have to include some of this because we need to laugh sometimes, right?  So let me play this clip.

            "text": "All right.  So that explains Meghan McCain perfectly.  And look.  To her defense, to the defense of Meghan McCain, she's only a talk show host.  I mean, it could have been worse.  She could be president.  So this is a system that has also benefited Donald Trump.  It's this society where the people that are born into wealth, born into power, born into privilege, they are going to continue to have that wealth, that power, and that privilege and think that they earned it and give them the sense of, oh, yeah, I'm here because I deserve to be here.  And then... In many cases, push other people down because they think that they earned it while those who are poor are, oh, you're only poor because you're lazy.  You didn't try hard enough.  That's how this entire society operates right now.  And people are becoming more and more aware that that's the case and waking up to it.  Now, I want to share one tweet here on the Meghan McCain clip that I think is just perfect.  Ben Dixon tweeted out, And that's exactly right.  Now... I want to get back, though, to the main story here, which is the college scam and some other reactions to that.  So I think this was a fantastic perspective to share.  This is Clint Smith.  He's a writer and doctoral candidate at Harvard.  And he has a series of tweets on this.  So he tweeted out, Thinking about all the black, brown, and low-income students who arrive at college and who are made to feel as if they don't deserve to be there, while so many wealthy students have their parents essentially buy their way into these schools and rarely experience the same skepticism.  Some people don't fully appreciate the psychological toll it takes on a student to navigate a school environment that both implicitly and explicitly tells you that you only got in because of an undeserving handout.  Meanwhile, somebody's parents donate a building and no one bats an eye.  The very idea of our society, higher ed or otherwise, being a meritocracy is something that was made up to justify and reify existing social hierarchies.  It's not real.  What's real is how wealth and race combine to give people things that they tell themselves they inherently deserve.  So I think this is maybe the most important point to come out of this entire thing.  And that's understanding that even though the wealthy have all the privilege, all the benefits, it's the ones that are black, brown or low income that are looked at as, oh, you're only here because you got a handout or you're only here because of affirmative action, not because you earned your way in.  when the reality is the opposite.  It's the privileged, it's the wealthy that only got there because they are privileged and wealthy.  Now look, that isn't always the case, but that is more likely the case than it is the reverse.  So this is an issue where it's weird to see people that are incredible privilege not understand that privilege.  meanwhile people in the middle class have a better understanding of their own privilege.  it's the whole thing is just weird to me.  but um there's one more uh opinion that i want to share on this whole story.  i saw this and i think this is also a fantastic perspective that i didn't think about until i saw this so ash clark tweeted out These are the type of parents who have kids to feed their own egos and narcissism.  They aren't thinking about their kids.  They are only thinking about how their kids add to or subtract from the image of success they are trying to project.  This really blew my mind because I didn't really think of it this way.  A lot of these parents, they don't really... Care if their kid goes to Harvard or not.  Because obviously their kid's going to be fine.  They have the money already.  I mean, they could put the money into a trust.  Their kid's good for life.  But they're paying to get their kids into these schools.  Because it makes them look good.  They want to be able to go to their friends.  Oh, my little Becky?  Yeah, she just got into Harvard.  How about that?  That's what this is about.  It's... I mean... It's sad in a way.  Because these kids... Look, if you're one of these kids and you actually do care about, I don't know, your life and you care about how you come off, how you look... For the rest of their lives, these kids now have attached to them the fact that they only got into whatever Ivy League school they got into because their parents paid off whoever they needed to pay off to get in.  They scammed the colleges into getting them into these schools.  They never earned it.  And this is something they're never going to be able to get away from.  I mean, it ruins the kids' lives.  And on top of that... It kind of exposes these parents and shows that, you know what, these parents, they didn't really do it for the love of their kids.  They can tell themselves that.  They can pretend it's about that.  But they know.  They know it's about how they come off.  They know that it's about their own image of success, how everybody else views them and their family.  That's ultimately what all of this is about. ",
