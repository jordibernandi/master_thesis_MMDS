Hunter Richards never did anything else except for a movie called Free the Nipple and I don't trust it, just based on what I know about London.  He was probably blackballed after it.  because it's so bad.  It's just so bad.  I'm surprised the rest of the cast wasn't.  I would say that they give all to this performance, but it's really just that like they're running through acting 101, you know, like Roger Ebert says.  So London is about a young man named Sid who's a junkie and really not good for, like, anything.  And he scores some drugs from Jason Statham playing a character named Bateman.  Sid takes Bateman to a party for Sid's ex-girlfriend London, even though throughout the movie he consistently says that she's still his girlfriend, which is not the case.  And for most of the movie, Sid and Bateman stay in the bathroom at this party and just get high and drunk to the point where, realistically, they should have, like, been dead on the floor.  This is the second movie in this series in Chris Evans' filmography where he also worked with Jessica Biel and Jason Statham, you'll remember from Cellular, which I actually really liked.  What happened?  Somebody let Hunter Richards take the wheel.  Our pros and cons list is mostly a cons list.  Do you want to read our pros since you are a much more optimistic person than I am? ",
