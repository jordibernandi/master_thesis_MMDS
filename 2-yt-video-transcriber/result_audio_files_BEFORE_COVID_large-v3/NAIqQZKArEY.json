However, this can be problematic when it comes to debating abortion, which is kind of a more moral issue, and we know which side tries to take the moral high ground.  One of the liberal talking points on this issue is that abortions can help save women's lives.  Can you provide a common argument for this argument, and while you're at it, can you? ",

            "text": "I mean, without trying to resolve the issue, and I'm no expert on it, I'll just tell you something that my daughter said to me the other day, just off the cuff.  She was on Facebook, and she goes, I've just been going from one page to the other of all my friends, and my daughter's 24, so she's in that age group.  all posting videos and sonograms of all their pregnancies in various stages of development.  And she goes, and I read these effusive descriptions that go with these sonograms.  I'm so excited.  My baby is a boy.  Blah, blah, blah.  Now, they're not thinking about abortion.  They're just thinking about what's happening.  And this is a very good indicator of truth, because it's not politicized.  These are people all across the political spectrum, and not one of them goes, oh, you know, it's just a clump of cells.  You know, one day it's going to be a baby, but it may, you know, I don't know, it could turn out to be a rat.  I just don't know, but that moment of birth is going to be the moment of truth.  No, all these people look and talk and act and behave as though they got a kid on the way.  And it's nothing else, it is both life and it is human life.  And it may be human life that needs to be geographically extricated from the womb, but that it is life and that it is human life is not even open to question.  And then you just turn, you like put aside real life and you go into politics, Roe versus Wade.  No one knows when life begins.  Now you know you're dealing with basically a group of octogenarians who are not talking about the real world and are echoing pure BS.  By BS I mean a denial of the world as it is in order to serve a certain purpose, right?  So there it is.  I think what makes the abortion debate, I think, for me so poignant, and it's just this.  It's not even that it's a woman kills a child.  It's that a woman kills her own child.  Now, think about it.  If it was an honor killing, we would be outraged.  Oh my God, he killed his own daughter!  And yet, even in the honor killing, in the honor killing, the person who does it, the Muslim radical or the... honor killer, feels that this person has violated the family contract.  They've done something that has brought shame and disgrace on the family.  They might be wrong about that, but they believe that the contract has been torn up.  But no one can say that about the fetus.  No one can say the fetus tore up the social contract.  The fetus put me in a really awkward position.  No, you put yourself in that position.  So the sheer drama of what is going on.  It can be hidden from sight, but I don't think it can be avoided to any morally alert person who allows himself to think about the issue. ",
