Matt Ficori is a criminal defense attorney and a former prosecutor for the very same county there in Chicago, and Cheryl Dorsey is a retired LAPD police sergeant.  So thank you both so much for being on with me.  And Matt, just starting with you, Smollett is still, saw him the other day in the courthouse, claiming his innocence.  Others, the other side points to evidence to the contrary.  Why wouldn't both sides want this thing to go to trial? ",

So, I mean, the fact that it's sealed and not expunged, by the way, it is just sealed, which means that the police and the FBI and other government agencies still have access to it.  The fact that it's sealed does make it obviously difficult for the public to access this.  And you could say whatever you want because you know that certain people, mainly the public, do not have access to a sealed record.  So, essentially, he could make whatever claims he wants.  But nobody's really going to be able to see those actual police reports at this point now that it's been sealed. ",

That's a lot of money.  And so there's going to be a price to pay long term with regards to this.  And I understand why they're upset and whether or not they'll have a complete... recovery and a good relationship with the prosecutor going forward is questionable.  They have a symbiotic relationship.  They depend on one another.  But listen, prosecutors don't drop cases like this just because.  Let's call it what it is.  Jesse got the homie hookup because he had a defense team who did their job.  They did what they were supposed to do.  And so, you know, and because of his celebrity, you know, Joe Q, citizen, me, if I had done that, I promise you I'd be sitting in court right now.  And if I were innocent, as Jesse says he is, I would want to sit in court right now because forevermore there is an asterisk after his name.  There are people who are always going to believe that he was guilty.  And I think he was.  That's why he said keep that 10 grand on your way out the door. ",

And so, you know, they make deals with the devils all the time.  Prosecutors do.  They will let one go to get the bigger fish.  And I think that's what they did.  And listen, there was a $35,000 payment made.  We know that because we saw the check.  The brothers say they're training fees are only $20 an hour.  So I think they've already been financially made whole, if you will.  And so there's no responsibility for them to come forward and say anything.  They're doing the right thing.  They're out of it.  They're sitting back and just looking and maybe shopping right now. ",
