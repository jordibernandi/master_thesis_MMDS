            "text": "Hello family, I would like to thank our monthly partners and all those who give to Stephen Darby Ministries.  The ministry is moving forward as we heal from losing such a great man of God.  Pastor Steve was such a prolific teacher who left an awesome legacy.  He always said that his secret weapon was his family and he trained us in excellence to handle the ministry.  And we intend to do just that.  Stephen Dorby Ministries will be holding conferences in different cities.  We will be holding a conference in Baltimore, Maryland, November of 2019.  The conferences are a way to still fellowship with our brothers and sisters who may not be able to travel to Louisville, Kentucky to attend the Destiny Ministries service.  Pastor Steve would always say that one day YouTube was going to take his channel down off their platform.  And it's their platform because of the raw truth that he preached.  And we are getting closer and closer to that day where this channel will be taken down.  But to God be the glory, we are not without hope.  We have another channel, which is Stephen Darby Ministries 2, which will be uploaded immediately if our first channel is taken down.  Stephen Darby Ministries has its own media platform of 24-7 messages on our website, stephendarbyministries.com.  so if you go to youtube and find out our channel has been taken down.  go to stephendarbyministries.com and click on discern tv or go to www.desirntv.com.  Remember, Stephen Dorby Ministries is the official website for all things Stephen Dorby.  Praise God, Grace Retreat is finished.  Grace Retreat is one of the many visions of Pastor Stephen Dorby.  It's 45 acres of land in the country that attracts deer, wild turkeys, and other animals to its picturesque scenery.  I have to give a huge shout out to the men of Destin Ministries who helped build and work the land.  Everything out there was built by the sweat of our brow and the work of our hands.  We will be hosting our first retreat in October 2019.  Grace Retreat is a retreat where you can come and be spiritually refreshed by spending time with God surrounded by his beautiful nature.  You can sit at the pond and fish all day if you choose, go paddle boating, hike the trails, gather around the fire pit, or just sit back and relax on the deck.  It's such a wonderful atmosphere that you will enjoy it.  Our first singles meet and greet conference was a success, and we plan to do another one in 2020.  And again, thank you for your love, your support, and prayers as we continue the legacy of Pastor Stephen Dorby Sr.  Be blessed. ",
