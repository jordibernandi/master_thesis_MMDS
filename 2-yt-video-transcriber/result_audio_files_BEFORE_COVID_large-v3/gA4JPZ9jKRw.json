Using time travel as a key plot driver, Legends of Tomorrow is able to put its characters through some truly bizarre situations, like Vikings worshiping an Elmo-like toy called Bebo, or a unicorn murdering people at Woodstock.

They're not legends.  In fact, they're basically the opposite of legends, because the timeline wouldn't even notice their absence.  Obviously, since they've gotten four seasons out of it, the main crew do end up having a pretty substantial impact on the timeline.  But the basic premise of the show, baked into the title itself, is that these aren't your typical superheroes.  They are nobodies who are trying to be legends, and that allows the show to go in a direction that wouldn't necessarily work for other superhero shows.  No one expects the Legends to be intense, crime-fighting superheroes, because that's not what they've ever been.  They're some people with interesting abilities trying to fix the timeline.

This timeline exists within what the show calls the temporal zone, which is just a space where their ship can fly through without being in any particular time period.  And so if someone messes something up in present time on the Time Traveler timeline, but in 1940 on the regular timeline, and that screw-up makes it so that none of the legends are born, they have to act quickly to fix it.  because those changes happened in the present on the Time Traveler timeline, and within a certain amount of time will ripple throughout the temporal zone and erase them from existence.  Are you confused?  Because so am I. Does it make the most sense?  Not really.  But hey, time travel stuff never really makes sense, and these plot devices lend themselves well to the drama of a TV show.  They only have a couple other rules, one of them being that once they've gone back to a specific time, they can't go back again to that exact time and interact with their past selves because it would break the timeline or something.  I guess that helps their actions seem more meaningful because you know they can't really go back and correct any mistakes, but it's not much.  Their other time travel rule, don't try to save your loved ones and change the timeline, is messed with pretty much constantly. ",

I think there's a strength in those kinds of shows as well, when they have so little plot that you can turn off your mind and just relax for a bit.  But while Legends is weird and silly, I wouldn't describe it as mindless or bad.  It's just captivating in a different way.  It makes you care about the characters not because they're brooding and intense, but because they're funny and real.  Legends of Tomorrow does have its touching and emotional moments.  Like Zari teaching Mick about Ramadan.  Or Ava, who is a clone and therefore never had a childhood, getting to transform back into a kid and have her first kiss.  Or Sarah helping a lesbian from the 1950s accept that she's okay just the way she is.  Or Mick coming to terms with his daddy issues.  Or Nate coming to terms with his daddy issues.  Or Amaya reconnecting with her ancestors.  Or Zari realizing that she can't save her family. ",

Sarah, the captain in the later seasons, openly has relationships with men and women.  When John Constantine becomes a regular in season 4, we learn that he's also had relationships with men and women.

            "text": "So many major TV shows shy away from having openly queer characters, or they might just have one token gay character.  For Legends to have multiple queer main characters is huge.  There is not a lot of queer representation on TV, especially bisexual representation, and especially not in superhero shows.  Having Sarah and Constantine just be themselves in Legends means the world to a lot of people watching this show.  Especially because the show isn't about their sexuality.  It's not a coming out story, it's just who they are.  Because you don't need a reason for a character to be queer.  Sometimes people just are that way, and yet so many shows don't have the courage to do what Legends does with ease.  It's all of this together that makes Legends of Tomorrow, in my opinion, the best superhero show on TV right now.  It's weird, it's fun, it's entertaining, it's telling stories that nobody else is telling.  What more could you ask for?  And even though the fourth season is coming to an end soon, it's already been renewed for a fifth season, which means there's a whole lot more wackiness still to come.
