            "text": "The Book of Sirach, chapter three.  Children, listen to me because I'm your father.  Do what I tell you and you will be safe.  YAH honors a father more than his children.  He confirms a mother's authority over her children.  those who honor their fathers make peace with yah for their sins and those who respect their mothers are like those who store treasures.  those who honor their fathers will find joy in their own children and when they pray they will be heard.  those who respect their fathers will live long lives And those who obey Yah are a comfort to their mothers.  They serve their parents in the same way that they serve Yah.  Honor your fathers by what you say and do so that you may have his blessing.  A father's blessing makes the families of his children strong, but a mother's curse destroys the ties that bind the family together.  Don't make yourself look good by making your father look bad.  When your father looks bad, you look bad.  Children receive honor when their father is honored.  Children are disgraced when their mother is not respected.  My child, help your father in his old age.  Don't make him grieve as long as he lives.  Be patient with him when his mind fails.  Since you have all your faculties, you don't have the right to despise him.  The kindness you show your father will not be forgotten.  It will be taken into account when you sin.  It will be remembered in your favor when you are in distress.  Your sins will melt away like the frost in the sunshine.  However, whoever abandons his father is like someone who curses the Most High Elohim.  Whoever makes his mother angry is cursed by Yahweh.  My child, carry out your duties humbly.  Then you will be loved more than those who give expensive gifts.  The more important you are, the more humble you must be.  Then you will find favor in Yah's presence.  Yah's power is great, but he accepts honor from humble people.  Don't pry into matters that are more difficult for you.  Don't investigate things that you were not strong enough to handle.  Reflect on what YAH has commanded you to do, what He has kept hidden if none of your business.  Don't meddle in affairs that are beyond you because you have already been shown more than you can understand.  Hasty decisions have led many astray, and wrong ideas have clouded people's judgment.  Being stubborn will eventually get you into trouble, and whoever loves danger will die as a result of it.  Being stubborn will burden you with all sorts of trouble.  A sinner piles one sin on top of another.  Arrogance is a disease for which there is no cure because evil is too firmly rooted in an arrogant person.  A sensible person appreciates stories used as illustrations.  A wise person likes to have attentive audience.  As water extinguishes a raging fire, so giving gifts to the poor makes peace with Elohim for sins.  Whoever repays favors keeps the future in mind.  When that person begins to stumble, he will find support. ",
