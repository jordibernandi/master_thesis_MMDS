            "text": "In part one of this infinite series of videos, we looked at the PragerU video titled God and Suffering, and in particular the first argument made by Professor Peter Kreeft in his attempt to get God off the hook for evil and suffering.  First, he attempted to use the free will argument to remove God from the culpability and responsibility which is by definition that of any omnipotent being.  Next, Professor Krief says that the problem of evil exists only if God exists, because without God, there is no objective standard for judging evil. ",

            "text": "In addition, if there were no God, there would be no absolute standard of good.  Every judgment presupposes a standard.  And that's true of our moral judgments, too.  What is our standard for judging evil to be evil?  The most we could say about evil, if there were no God, was that we, in our subjective tastes, didn't like it when people did certain things to other people.  So, the problem of human evil exists only if God exists. ",

            "text": "This is just an attempt to deny the problem of evil outright by defining it out of existence.  By saying that evil can't exist without God, an all-good God, by the way, the kind of God who would never create evil but somehow did and even admitted it, hashtag cognitive dissonance, theists are ultimately revealing their underlying premise for everything they think about God, that nothing could exist without Him.  But if that's the case, there is no point in arguing or making arguments, is there?  Just be honest and say that for you, God is simply a brute fact immune to reason or doubt.  As I've mentioned in numerous videos, terms like objective standard and objective morality are meaningless because we have no objective way to know what these supposed objective standards and morals should be.  The Christian says the adulterer should be forgiven.  The Muslim says the adulterer should be killed.  Both are following their particular God's objective standard based on nothing objective.  That puts the atheist and theist in the same boat in terms of the subjectivity of such judgments.  The atheist subjectively chooses her values, and the theist subjectively chooses her giver of values.  or more accurately, in general, is forced to choose a particular giver of values as a small child before he or she is rationally equipped.  In the meantime, people are still genuinely suffering.  Men, women, children are being raped, murdered, tortured, made to watch network television.  But I guess if there's no God, none of those things are truly evil?  They only feel evil subjectively?  I guess I just don't understand why that's not enough.  If tomorrow we discovered beyond any shadow of a doubt that there was no God, would Professor Kreef then be okay with his children being raped, tortured, and murdered?  Would the pain triggered by the loss of his children be meaningless because it's only his subjective experience?  And would the fact that it was merely his subjective experience reduce the impact or suffering he and his children feel?  Whether or not one thinks there is a logically consistent way to call something objectively evil or not, we all suffer.  To suggest that the lack of a God renders us incapable of declaring such suffering objectively evil is quite irrelevant to those who are presently afflicted.  They still suffer.  And their suffering is a fact.  Please note that Professor Kreef's dodge didn't address suffering, only evil and whether we are able to make such declarations objectively.  I suspect he would be less inclined to dismiss suffering in the same way.  If so, I'd be happy to put such a dismissal to the test.  Perhaps with, I don't know, a little waterboarding?  Maybe removing his fingernails one by one?  Does it really matter whether we're able to call the suffering of sentient beings objectively evil?  No, our suffering does not call into question the existence of God.  But it definitely calls into question the goodness, omnipotence, and or omniscience of that God if such a being exists.  At the very least, we can imagine a better God.  who would not allow such suffering under any circumstance.  We can also imagine a God who would either not create evil or, at the very worst, create evil as a far more benign force, especially since He's the guy who gets to define such things.  For instance, let's imagine that God didn't already know how everything would play out.  And then let's imagine, as many Christians do, that this life is a test to see which of us will make the right choices.  If sin is defined as falling short of the glory of God, any sin will do in terms of God being able to determine whether or not we'll spend eternity with Him or burn in hell forever.  Christian theologians themselves will tell you that all sins are equal in God's eyes.  That means God never needed to allow us to cause each other such horrific suffering.  Any little act in which we fall short of God's glory would have sufficed in terms of providing an indicator of our worthiness.  Stealing a penny would have done the trick.  So murder, rape, torture never needed to be on the table.  This would also cover our free will, at least in terms of us getting to make the choice to follow God or not.  But according to those following the tribal war god of Abraham, God does know which of us will choose good over evil.  He has known ever since the beginning of time.  He also knows which of us will end our reign of evil with the theft of a penny and which of us will go on wholesale killing sprees causing endless suffering to our fellow beings.  Choosing to create those who would do terrible evil to others is not only awful to those others who will suffer such evil, but to the being doing the evil as well, as that person will suffer forever in hell.  And God knew it!  There is no escape from the problems of evil and the suffering of sentient beings supposedly created by God.  When you create everything, set the parameters, are all powerful, and know exactly how every little thing will play out, you are entirely responsible for everything that happens.  Hashtag personal responsibility.  Of course, Professor Kreef subjectively doesn't like his God being responsible.  So he's come up with even more silliness in an attempt to get God off the hook.  And we'll look at that next time.  Until then, I'm not you.  Thanks for watching. ",
