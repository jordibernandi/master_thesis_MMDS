            "text": "Looking back on the year 2019 and reading all the financial press, there's a tremendous hoopla about how well the stock market did last year.  And so I want to give an analysis briefly about that performance.  It was better than almost anyone expected back in December of 2018. when the stock market was going down in a hurry.  And indeed, that's where the story should start.  Because what happened towards the end of 2018 was the decision by the Federal Reserve in this country, our central bank, to begin to undo the unprecedented, historically unprecedented, increase in money pumped into the economy coupled with a decrease in interest rates, making that money virtually free to borrowers.  It was a decision of the Federal Reserve at the end of 2018 to cut back on this, which is what the textbooks say you should do when you pump money into an economy trying to cope with the crash of 2020. back then, you should undo your increase, especially if it's historically unprecedented.  So the Federal Reserve decided towards the end of 2018 to begin to do that, to raise interest rates.  It had predicted it would raise it three times in 2019. and to begin to undo what they call quantitative easing.  Instead of printing money and pumping it into the economy, buying securities, they would do the opposite.  Sell the securities they had purchased before and thereby pull money out of the economy as private citizens and companies buy those securities and use up their money to do so.  Without getting into the weeds of all of this, everything changed when the stock market collapsed towards the end of 2018, frightening everybody who owns shares significant amounts, which is the top five or ten percent of the American people.  If even that, the vast majority of Americans either have no shares of stock or have trivial amounts that don't basically affect them in most of their lives.  Okay, so when the stock market goes down, two things happen.  The business community, the owners of businesses, the owners of shares of stock in significant amounts, get freaked out, and they want something done.  And since they control capitalism, they get their way.  The second thing was the commander-in-chief of the people at the top, Donald Trump.  understood that as he was losing a significant portion of the mass of people, he had to hold on even more to the top 5% whose wealth he had increased starting with the tax cut of 2017 and keeping right on going.  And so that meant that He, like the business community he represents, needed to do something quick about the falling stock market.  And so we know what he did, and we know what the Federal Reserve did.  They reversed themselves on a dime.  They went from selling securities and pulling money out of the market to doing the opposite, resuming the printing of money and the use of that money to buy securities.  and instead of raising interest rates to offset all that they had done since the crash of 2008, they did the opposite.  They brought interest rates down to historic lows.  These things boosted the stock market, thereby recouping the wealth lost when stock owners suffered that decline at the end of 2018, and increasing Mr.  Trump's chances for re-election because the people whose stocks went up could be approached for the donations he will need to offset all the negatives his behavior has produced.  So here we have it, an artificially credit-based pump-up of the stock market.  And let's remember, we pumped up the market for high-tech, and we got the dot-bomb crash in 2000.  We then lowered interest rates and created a boom in housing that led to the subprime mortgage crash in 2007 and 8.  And we are now building an extraordinary debt bomb that will blow up now that everybody popular people, homes, businesses, and governments have been borrowing record sums because it's virtually cheap money, that will come to a bad end.  And all Mr.  Trump hopes is it'll happen after the November election.  And all the people at the top hope it won't happen at all.  But capitalism's history tells us that what goes up comes down, and that what goes up longer and further comes down sooner and harder.  Don't be fooled.  This is an artificial high, and we will be paying the price sooner than we even fear.  This is Richard Wolff with today's Economic Update. ",
