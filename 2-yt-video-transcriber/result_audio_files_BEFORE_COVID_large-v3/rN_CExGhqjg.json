            "text": "When I did the previous video about PragerU's lawsuit against YouTube, I didn't know at the time that the court had already issued a decision about it.  In fact, there were a couple of attempts that PragerU made to sue YouTube, both of which failed.  The poor quality of the arguments PragerU's lawyers use make me believe that they are either not very competent, or they don't really aim to win so much as they aim to use litigation for publicity purposes.  The first attempt to sue was back in March of 2018.  Reason Magazine has an article about PragerU's court proceedings, and even that libertarian magazine seems just as unimpressed with them as I am.  The biggest problem is that PragerU seems to be trying to argue that their First Amendment rights are being infringed upon because some of their videos get restricted to keep children from watching them.  Since the First Amendment doesn't apply to a private company's terms of service, this is obviously a silly allegation.  But Prager thought they had found a precedent that allowed them to credibly make this argument.  According to Reason, they cited Marsh v. Alabama, a 1946 case in which the Supreme Court held that Chickasaw, a mobile suburb owned and controlled by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, violated the First Amendment when it banned Jehovah's Witnesses from distributing religious literature on a sidewalk near the post office.  That decision hinged upon the fact that Gulf Shipbuilding was acting in all respects like a local government, performing functions that ordinarily would be reserved to the state.  The court in that case ruled that this company town was subject to the First Amendment and therefore was violating the Jehovah's Witnesses' First Amendment rights.  However, the difference between this company town and YouTube is that YouTube does not perform the functions that ordinarily would be reserved to the state.  Nonetheless, PragerU attempted to argue that anyone hosting a forum for speech which is open to the public is, somehow, performing the function of a state.  The judge who first ruled against Prager in March of last year said that, unlike the private corporation in March, Judge Koh observed, defendants do not own all the property and control all aspects and municipal functions of an entire town.  Far from it, defendants merely regulate content that is uploaded on a video-sharing website that they created as part of a private enterprise.  Prager's lawyer, however, argued that YouTube is not just a company town, they're arguably a company country, and maybe a company world force.  How the US Constitution would have jurisdiction over a world force, whatever that even is, is not very clear.  The court said in their motion to dismiss, defendants contend that Plaintiff's First Amendment claim fails because Plaintiff does not sufficiently allege that defendants are state actors.  For the reasons discussed below, the court agrees with defendants.  The court cited previous judges who contended that the Marsh decision was never intended to apply outside the very special situation of a company-owned town.  In the appeal in August of 2019, even the Republican-appointed judges didn't buy PragerU's argument.  Reason quotes the judges saying, I'm not sure that creates a First Amendment issue.  PragerU argued that since YouTube is a public forum, it should be ideologically neutral.  The court said, however, that YouTube is only a public forum in a colloquial sense.  PragerU's lawyer, Peter Obstler, argued that it is essentially the fact that YouTube presents itself as neutral that makes its alleged ideological bias a problem.  The Reason article says, in the end, however, Obstler's argument came down to YouTube's self-presentation.  If YouTube admits that political considerations influence its filtering decisions, he said, the problem goes away.  Google's lawyer Brian Willen noted that the First Amendment isn't a switch that gets turned on or off based on how a private business describes itself.  And if PragerU's position were accepted, he said, the result would be a much more clamped down and closed internet, since platforms like YouTube would have powerful incentives to abandon any aspiration to ideological neutrality.  Perhaps it was ultimately PragerU's goal to force YouTube to simply admit a liberal bias.  Whatever bias YouTube has, however, is clearly not decided by YouTube itself, but by its advertisers.  There are plenty of liberal and left-wing channels whose videos also get censored and demonetized.  There is certainly a bias, but it is not a bias against conservatives.  It's a bias against anything YouTube's advertisers see as bad for their brand.  They don't want to be associated with certain videos, and they don't want to be associated with YouTube if YouTube doesn't take steps to marginalize those videos.  That sucks, but PragerU is blaming this on the left, when it's clearly a function of the free market which PragerU claims to love so much.  To everyone who helps me out on Patreon, you're a big help.  Thanks so much. ",
