And that's about the risks of colonoscopies and how you can get some serious side effects and how we found some natural treatments that were able to pull us out of that.  So the story starts, as many of ours tend to, with Lyme disease, which I contracted in the woods from a tick and brought home and was generous enough to pass on to my wife, which they don't tell you you can, but you can.  And so because we're both chronic Lyme survivors, this is something we've been battling for a long time.  We had over a year of antibiotic therapy, which really weakened our immune systems because your gut and your intestines and the natural flora that exists in your intestines is actually the place that your body can contact the outside world more than even outside of you is, more of the outside of you is inside of you than you see from the outside.  And so both of us have noticed that our immune systems in general and our ability to resist catching things that we get exposed to is reduced since then.  So we have to be very watchful and cautious about exposure.  Well, it turned out that... ",

And that seemed to be working pretty well for us.  But we had a lot of other things.  we were doing, tinctures and this and that.  And it just seemed like the whole thing added up to so much when you put it all together that I thought, maybe if we just take this one thing, it might help.  But Melody kept noticing that I wasn't tolerating it well.  And I was just stubbornly sticking with it longer than I probably should have given, you know, just pay attention to what your body's telling you.  And what happened was I ended up being concerned because I had a previous history of Crohn's disease that maybe this, uh, bleeding which I was happening internally could have been related to something that needed a recurrence of my Crohn's.  so better have a look with a colonoscopy.  having interviewed dr.  Jane Nielsen in the past he had expressed one of the news stories which he's flashed up to us before.  was that even properly sanitized whatever that means colonoscopes can pass infectious diseases from one patient to another one being C diff And C. diff is a particularly dangerous and can be fatal bacterial infection you can get in your intestines.  So I was concerned.  I consulted with him about it.  He said, yeah, you might want to be careful.  So I consulted with the GI about it and said, I don't know if I want to go through this colonoscopy, but we really wanted to find out the source of the internal bleeding, but we didn't want to risk that.  He said, oh, it's very low, very low risk.  So especially since it was nearing the end of the year and we were under the time pressure of our insurance deductible, which had been satisfied that year, would have been much, make the procedure much cheaper to do in December, much more expensive to do after that.  I thought, all right, we'll go ahead and do it.  We're going to, about to travel internationally.  I just want to get this thing done.  So went in and subjected to a colonoscopy and, uh, came through that pretty well.  Yeah, no, right, yeah.  No problem for the colonoscopy, and the results were all clear, looks good and clean. ",

And this was something like I had almost never experienced before.  I mean, I was just like very frequent and trips.  And I couldn't eat and everything just went right through me.  And any attempt we had of, hey, we don't want to have me losing weight again.  Let's throw more calories in.  It doesn't help.  I could tell that my whole digestive system was just out of commission, shut down.  So we started some ordinary, over-the-counter remedies that you could get.  We had brought along some, like Pepto-Bismol, and that did nothing, even no matter what doses I was taking.  Also, in the past, and I'm going to show you how to do this real quick, because this is usually really successful, but this one was not an ordinary treatment. ",

And when they give you the herbs, you can just cut those up with some heavy-duty shears, put them in boiling hot water for 20 minutes, make a tea, strong tea, and drink that.

Didn't touch this stuff.  This stuff was like worse than I ever had.  That's why we were suspicious that this really could have been C. diff.  And if you think about the potential seriousness of you're going into a hospital or serious clinic environment, they're using a colonoscope, which they have used inside somebody else's body.  And that person might not have been in for a routine wellness screening.  That might have been somebody who had a serious disease.
