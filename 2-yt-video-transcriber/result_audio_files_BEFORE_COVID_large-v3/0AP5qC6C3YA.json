            "text": "Hey guys, I want to come on here and talk about 90 Day Fiance before the 90 days.  And this is season three, episode one.  And A lot of the couples are new.  They have four new couples, and then they have two previous couples.  Of course, those couples are Angela, Dean, and Michael, and Darcy.  And Darcy was from before the 90 days, the last season, and Darcy just simply cannot keep a man.  That's what we know about Darcy, is that she can't keep a man.  She's overly emotional.  She seems quite annoying, very insecure.  I believe that her age has something to do with it, but I'm going to make a prediction right now and say that she is not going to keep the man that she is with.  They didn't really go too much into her relationship with him because this was just introductions, but based on the way that it's going, he doesn't really seem to be as into her as she is into him.  She said that she met him online.  She had known him when she was dating Jesse.  And Jesse is the younger guy that she had been with on last season of Before the 90 Days.  If you've watched it and you followed it, Darcy and Jesse broke up.  They just had a very toxic relationship.  A lot of it, I feel like, was on her because Darcy seems to be very controlling.  And she undermines everything that he did.  I feel like she's one of those women who... ",

            "text": "...are emotionally weak, but they have to go out of their way and do things to try and prove that they're actually strong.  I don't know if it's because she has a black cousin and she feels like she needs to measure up and be... strong on the level of the stereotype of the strong black woman but she appears to be weak to me and she appears to be one of those people who try desperately hard to be strong and in the process of doing that she tends to turn men off and push them away because she doesn't know how to allow them to be a man.  and that's something that I observed with her and Jesse.  and Not to say that Jesse was a good choice for her.  I don't think he was.  I think he wanted the control in the relationship.  He wanted to pretend to be an alpha male when he wasn't.  But those are just some of the things that I've observed about Darcy.  And it's really interesting because Darcy, who cannot keep a man to save her life, like she literally just cannot keep a relationship.  She was on Pillow Talk judging other people's relationships, specifically Nicole and Azen and... Chantel and Pedro talking about what she would do and what she wouldn't tolerate, trying to give advice to Chantel when she hasn't kept a man on any one of these seasons.  She has yet to get married and she's in her mid forties, not saying that she has to be married, but apparently that's something that she wants to do.  And so that's an interesting dynamic, but I'm telling you guys about this prediction.  And my prediction is that they're not going to last.  But one of the new couples is 19-year-old Avery and 24-year-old Omar.  And Avery is from Columbus, Ohio.  And Omar is from Syria.  And Avery talked about how she had a wild past.  Does she remind any of you guys of Hilary Duff like she reminds me?  Of course, like a much chunkier version of Hilary Duff.  But she really reminds me in her face of Hilary Duff.  But anyway, I digress.  Avery used to be a Christian and she decided to convert it to Islam.  She didn't really go into detail as to why.  she just said she felt it was a better fit for her.  Um, so she joined a Muslim dating site.  Then she met Omar.  They went through the so-called rigmarole of getting emotionally attached.  And now they're engaged, which she just revealed to her family is that she was actually engaged.  They never met face to face and she's actually going out there.  She's supposedly meeting him for the first time and then getting married to him.  But I don't know how much this is going to work.  It sounds like she just wanted to get outside of her life that she was in.  All of her friends and family are saying that she's not being herself.  It's not her.  They're shocked and surprised.  Some of her family made some really dumb decisions.  Really, really dumb statements like the one who said, well, obviously I'm American, so I wouldn't speak another language.  I'm.  hopefully they don't show her this season anymore because she is a problem.  Like, I can't I just I can't deal with that.  ignorance on that level.  The couple, the interracial couples, they haven't showed, and that's Angela Deem and Michael, and then you have Benjamin, and you have a Kenyi, she's from Kenya, then you have 47-year-old Rebecca, and she met a 26-year-old Zaid from Tunisia, and she's the one who has all of the filters over her, like the amount of filters that she uses is ridiculous.  Like she's literally trying to make herself 20 years younger, look 20 years younger with those filters that she uses.  Now, when the show ended, she was about to go on her way to Tunisia to meet this man.  And she has to tell them that number one, she's still married.  Then he has to get through the fact that her 50 filters are gone and she doesn't have them in person.  I don't know why people use all these filters.  It's like, what are you going to do when the man meets you in person to see that you're literally just not who you are?  So first, Zaid has to get past the lack of the 50 filters that she's been using, catfishing.  Then he has to get past the fact that she's still married, but... That's what they're going through.  And it seems like they're going to kind of get past that a little bit.  But we'll see how her story pans out.  She's a private detective.  She's been tracking people, of course.  And her whole story was that she's been cheated on.  This is not her first time meeting someone overseas.  She said it didn't work out the first time.  But, you know, because she's desperate for this thing called love.  She'll go seek someone in another country with all her secrets, her lies, and her 50 filters.  And anyway, let's move on from her.  But then you got Timothy.  And he's a 38-year-old.  He's from Charlotte, North Carolina.  He's there.  He's built his own wealth.  He's with this woman, Jennifer, from Colombia.  He went specifically, he said, on the Colombian website and picked her out.  He found her from the same place in Colombia that Russ found Paola from the same city.  I guess I don't think they call them cities, but we'll just say country in Colombia.  that they found them from.  so it is what it is.  but let me tell y'all before I get into this pathetic Caesar let me just say something with Angela Dean because Angela they showed a preview where Angela and Michael are obviously still talking.  I don't know how if you guys have been following the show.  I don't know if you guys have been following the show.  If you have, then you've seen Michael and Angela's interactions.  You know that Angela is 52 going on 80.  You know he has compared her to a man several different times.  He doesn't appear to be attractive to her.  Angela also has a criminal record.  Her daughter has a criminal record.  She has been nasty and abusive.  But y'all tell me why... She's going to be in there talking about Micah wants a baby.  I said, if you don't get out of here with those old dried up eggs, you don't even need to go get an ultrasound to figure out that your eggs are dust.  That womb is not producing anything.  If she don't get that old tired womb off the camera and stop acting like she's about to pop out a baby when she knows she's not, They need to just go ahead with that storyline.  I'm not even about to watch a storyline where somebody as old and dried up as Angela is about to try to have a kid.  I don't care how many, she won't get pregnant with somebody else's eggs.  It's just not happening.  Dust is what will come from her womb.  But anyway, Caesar, y'all.  Why does Cedar's story embody every single thing that I talk about on my other channel with regard to black men who choose to perpetuate these relationships?  Tell me why.  Tell me why.  Tell me why.  First of all, he is a nail tech.  And I swear to you that he embodies femininity.  This Ukrainian woman, she does not like him.  It's obvious.  He has been trying to pursue her and pay her to like him for five years.  He said he's given her $40,000 over that time.  You know he's a nail tech, so he's not making a lot of money.  He's borrowing it from his Asian friend.  He's sending her $800 to $900 a month.  Anybody will tell you that they love you if you're paying them $800 to $900 a month for five years.  Right there, she got a part-time job on her hands and she don't have to do anything.  She don't even have to remember her name.  The producers literally asked him, has she ever called you by your name?  This genius just sit there and looked like the bus was coming.  Tell me why she don't even know this man's name.  Probably have her referred to him by his name one time, but he has his vision is focused on whiteness.  Do y'all see the way he was looking when he sat there and start looking at her pictures online?  This is so sad and so pathetic.  It really is.  And what makes it so pathetic is that she is not into him.  And why do people keep getting caught up in these scams with these Russian Ukrainian women?  Like the thing he's sitting here acting surprised.  Obviously, if every single time you try to meet up with somebody, she got another excuse.  And then he's going to say that he this time when she's talking about they're going into martial law and they're going into war and he looks it up and say, you can still fly out.  He's still sitting here sitting there trusting her.  over five years multiple times and you never.  i'm not sending anybody that i've never met in person.  a penny is just not happening.  but look at how much he goes out of his way.  look at how he had dry nail polish on his fingers.  he couldn't even get some acetone to take the nail polish off of his fingers.  he's literally trying to buy love because he knows that he's older he's out of shape he's not desirable.  he's definitely not a select male and he just wants to live in a fantasy that somebody would actually want him.  And I mean, the chick is decent with all of her surgery, so it's quite obvious that she's not into him.  She's into the money that he's sending her.  And then even when they talked about this trip to the Ukraine, and he said, well, you can still fly out.  You see the nasty attitude she got with him?  It's so obvious.  Like, this is pathetic.  I'm telling y'all, pathetic.  It makes no sense.  Like, I don't understand.  He's the Nicole of this show.  He's the Nicole.  And I'm not talking about Nicole, Pedro's sister.  I'm talking about Nicole that's still chasing Azen over in Morocco who refuses to marry her and who cancels every single day.  Y'all tell me he doesn't remind you of Nicole.  Him and Nicole might as well just be together, both wrapped up in their own delusion.  thinking to people like them when they really don't like this dude, I can't, I just, I can't.  And he's so gone.  He's so gone.  So desperate because if you're going to spend 40,000, you mean to tell me he couldn't spend 40,000 on a black woman or any other woman, an American white woman would have taken him for you.  Senator 40,000 over the course of time.  That means he's sending just under what?  Nine, 10 grand per year.  And I mean, yeah, that's not a lot.  But when that's extra income combined, I mean, imagine if your job said, we're going to pay you $9,000 more a year.  You would be jumping for joy for that kind of raise.  You would, because they were making a significant impact.  Who couldn't use $800 to $900 more per month?  I know I sure could.  So this dude is just pathetic.  He's paying for love that he's never going to get.  And I promise you, at the end of the season, he's going to be sitting there looking stuck on stupid, just like Nicole.  waiting on Azen to act like he likes her.  But that wraps it up for season three, episode one of 90 Day.  Fiance Before the 90 Days.  Definitely tune in for more reviews, like, comment, subscribe, share the video, and I'll see you in the next one. ",
