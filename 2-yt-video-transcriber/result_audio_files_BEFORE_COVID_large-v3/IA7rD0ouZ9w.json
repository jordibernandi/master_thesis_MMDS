            "text": "What's going on everybody?  Welcome back to the channel.  First things first, here we go Steelers, here we go.  Team's going to kill it this year, 100%.  We don't need no AB.  We don't need no Lev Bell.  Everybody we got put in place is going to be primo.  We're going to the Super Bowl.  We'll see what happens in a few months here.  You can call me out on it if we don't, but I'm very confident we're going.  Let's get into today's video.  I want to talk to the young guys.  I want to talk to the young guys who are just starting out in life, trying to figure all this stuff out, dealing with dating, dealing with relationships, dealing with all these things.  I'm going to give you a very random five item list of things that I think every young guy should start doing right now.  Every guy in general should do, but definitely these young guys should start figuring out right this minute.  I don't want you old guys to stop watching though because I would like for you to listen to these five items and then I would like for you down in the comment section to give some of your suggestions of things that these young guys should always keep in mind as they're moving through this thing we call life.  Number one, always carry cash.  I think every guy should always have some cash on him, even if it's just a $20 bill.  You don't have to have hundreds of dollars on you, but you should always have some cash in your pocket.  You never know what you're gonna run into.  that requires cash only.  You never know whenever you're gonna run into a situation where a credit card isn't accepted or something of that nature.  You should always, always, always have some cash in your pocket.  Number two, never co-sign for anyone.  anyone.  I don't care if it's family.  I don't care if it's your wife.  I don't care who it is.  Don't ever put your credit and your name on a loan for somebody else.  Just don't do it.  I mean, my ex-wife, when we got divorced, we had a car that was in both of our names.  It was her car, but it was in both of our names because I had the better credit and I helped her get a better interest rate on it.  And you know what she did?  dumped that car right on me, could care less.  Couldn't, you know, couldn't care less.  And if it was only in her name, I wouldn't have gave a crap because it would have just hurt her credit.  Ended up hurting my credit too.  So I thought I was doing the right thing by helping her out with getting a better interest rate and all that stuff.  Never, ever, ever co-sign for somebody.  Number three, this one's important.  It's a two-parter.  Wear condoms, Don't be afraid to put a condom on.  I used to be called the condom king when I was in high school because I refused, refused to have sex without a condom on.  And this comes two parts, right?  One, you got the fact that you do not want to get a chick pregnant.  Bottom line, you just don't want to do it.  I mean, you're locking yourself into a crazy situation where you could be screwed for the rest of your life financially, emotionally, everything by getting a girl pregnant, especially when you're young.  But number two, Man, these STDs are running wild right now.  I mean, it's like 80. some percent of people have HPV, all the other ones that are going around.  I mean, it is just do your part, man.  Stay away from that stuff.  You don't want to catch any of these things.  Number four, this is an important one that my dad taught me.  Learn how to fix things.  learn how to take stuff apart and fix it.  you know we live in a disposable society where people will just throw something away.  my clothes washer just broke the other day.  right my daughter overloaded it.  uh i took it apart.  i flipped it upside down pulled it apart pulled the motor out.  all it was was a 10 starter capacitor ordered a new one online plugged it in slipped it right in there right back to working again.  learn how to fix things.  you know what my dad used to always tell me if it's already broken you can't break it more, right?  If you already broke it and you're thinking about just throwing it away and getting another one, what hurts to just try to get, man, these little, I think these are the cicadas.  You hear that thing talking, that thing is loud.  But if it's already broken, you're not gonna break it more.  If you're already thinking about getting rid of it, take it apart and see if you can fix it.  And I'll tell you the number one secret for that.  go onto YouTube, man, right where we're at right now.  Jump on YouTube, put in what you're looking for.  If you need to do brakes on your car, I guarantee you right now, if you type in your year, make, model of car and put in front brake replacement, rear brake replacement, there will be a video showing you exactly step-by-step how to work on your own car.  Learn how to fix things.  Not only that, it's gonna save you money in the long run because right now we have a complete loss of tradesmen.  I mean, when you look at appliance repairs, when you look at automotive repairs, when you look at HVAC, all that stuff, we have been telling kids for generations now that you don't wanna be like that guy.  Don't be like that guy over there.  Look how dirty he is.  Look at all that grease he has on his hands.  Go to college.  You don't wanna do that.  You know what that's created?  A world where you're gonna start paying mechanics more per hour, way more per hour, than you are ever going to pay yourself.  You're gonna get paid.  So just keep that in mind.  Learn how to fix things.  It'll save you tons of money down the road, and you look like a hero whenever you take care of stuff around the house.  So definitely learn how to fix things.  And my last one, number five.  Like I said, these are all just random.  Number five, don't get married.  don't do it especially not today not to the way things go.  you want to have a relationship that's fine.  you want to meet a girl and date her all that stuff you want to move in together with her.  that's fine.  do not get married.  it is the worst contract you can ever enter into ever in your life.  you're never going to find the worst contract in marriage.  there's a reason.  they did that survey where long-term relationship couples people that were together 10 years or longer Typically, it was 50-50 on who ended the relationship whenever they broke up.  So it was either the man or the woman.  It was right down the middle, 50-50.  As soon as you add that marriage contract in, that number goes up to 75% of marriages are ended by the woman.  Why do you think that is?  because they know that they got the upper hand.  They know they can take you for everything you're worth.  They're gonna take you to family court or whatever and they're gonna just get everything that they want out of you.  They can easily go get a lawyer who will tell them to file a PFA against you for something that you never did and take you for every penny that you're worth.  So I see nothing wrong with.  if you wanna be in a relationship with a woman, that's fine.  You wanna do your thing with them, that's fine.  I wouldn't do the marriage.  And you know what's funny is, the woman pushes the marriage.  The guys never push it.  The woman pushes it hard.  They want that thing so bad because they know that's in their back pocket.  At any moment, they could pull that card out and just go, I want a divorce, and just get whatever they want from you.  So, five random things I think every young guy should listen to.  I would like to hear your comments down in the comment section.  Give me some of your little pointer tips that you have for these young guys and let's help them out with their road down life.  So that's all I got for today.  I love you guys.  I'll see you next time.  Go Steelers. ",
