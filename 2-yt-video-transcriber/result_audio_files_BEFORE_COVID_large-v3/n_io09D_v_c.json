But the Apollo missions not only planned their missions to go through the weakest parts of the Van Allen belts but the command module actually had shielding against solar radiation.  The heat shield has several outer coverings, a pore seal, a moisture barrier, a white reflective coating and a silver mylar thermal coating.  that kind of looks like aluminium foil.  The silver mylar coating was a shield against infrared, visible light and invisible UV radiation as well as low energy alpha rays. ",

Mark Sargent, I challenge you to a debate because frankly, you would be a lot of fun to destroy in front of a bunch of people.  Now, before we go, let's look at another video, one that I found on Mark Friendzone Sargent's channel.  that made me really quite mad and perfectly explained, on its own, why I hate the flat earth.
