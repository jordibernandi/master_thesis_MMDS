            "text": "Hello, ladies and gentlemen.  Today is the 19th of August.  I'm Roy Potter.  Welcome.  You know, I really thought about doing some information on some of the crazy things that are going on, but I thought this might be of some interest to some of you, certainly not all of you.  I've had some requests to cover this subject, and in fact, tomorrow I'm going to be talking with a group of people about this very subject.  So I thought I'll just go ahead and do a short video, as short as mine can be, on this subject.  And the subject is Nephilim.  There's been a lot of talk about this, a lot of talk.  A lot of people talking about giants and finding super giant people, you know, 18 feet tall, 20 feet tall, whatever.  A lot of the people that study scriptures and talk about prophecy and all that talk about the DNA of the Nephilim still being amongst us.  And I agree with that.  But I think what I'm going to concentrate on is show you what the word is in Hebrew.  And that it really doesn't mean giant.  That's really not what it means.  I'm not sure why King James came up with that or even some of the other people that have done this.  I think it's because of the way they were trying to show how powerful these entities, these beings were.  So if you've come here to learn that we're talking about giants like Jack and the Beanstalk type of giant, it's really not what we're about.  And I hope this clears this up a little bit.  Now, we have people of huge stature amongst us even today.  There are people, men in particular, that get up to eight, almost nine feet tall on occasion.  And they've been documented even in recent history.  But those are genetic.  not abnormalities but they're rare now.  it could be that the the nephilim were big people.  i'm not.  i'm not going to deny that to those of you who who would like to think that big meaning big body tall.  you know 10 feet 12 feet whatever your your notion of that is.  but i want to show you what this really is in the hebrew and why i'm such a stickler about using the hebrew and going back to the original language and actually breaking down the words.  And I've done that before, right?  I've talked about rabbinic hermeneutics and the prophetic method and how the letters mean something in and of themselves.  And I'm not going to repeat myself on that.  You can go back to some of those videos that I've done so that you know.  So let's talk about the word nephil.  which Nephilim comes from.  And I don't know if you'll be able to see this too well.  The lighting in here isn't really good.  I had all the studio lights on.  It's just too dang hot, even with the air conditioning on full strength.  So you'll have to pardon me.  I hope this will do the job.  I put some notes over here, which you probably can't see.  And they're not important.  I'll tell you what they are.  Okay, so what we're going back to is Genesis and it talks about, you know, the fallen angels and that they saw the daughters of men that they were fair and took them to wife, which is a very interesting thing in and of themselves, right?  The sons of God taking the daughters of men.  And I'm not going to get into that right now because it will really affect some of the subject matter because we'll get off on a tangent.  And I want to concentrate on the word Nephilim.  So first of all, I'm going to back up just a little bit further because this gets really interesting.  In the first and second chapters of Genesis, it talks about God breathing his spirit into this church.  this being, soon to be a being, and that man became a living soul.  In other words, the body and God's spirit breathed into it, man becomes a living soul.  The word that's used for soul is this one right here, it's nephesh.  Okay?  And I wanted to show this to you because it's very, very important.  Now, I'm not putting the vowel points in here.  Certainly, the vowels change the meaning of the word slightly.  Not always, but to some extent.  But all of these, we're basically using the consonants only.  Okay?  In Nefesh, you have Nun... Pe, Shin.  Now, Nun and Pe is very interesting because it also shows up in the name of the Nephilim.  That's what these are here, okay?  These two right here.  This one's a little different.  We'll talk about that in a few minutes.  These two here, that's Nun, Pe, Lamed.  Lamed is a flail.  It's like a whip.  It means justice.  It means force.  It means rule, that kind of thing.  uh... and there's the.  the plural of that is nephilim and that's what this yod uh... mem here is on the end.  that's just a. that just shows it's a plural.  it's like an s. you know toys instead of toy toys.  in english the s is the plural.  eem here is the plural in this particular word.  okay so that's all we're looking at right now i just want to show you some some very important things.  okay first of all i want you to see that as i just mentioned the the nun and the pay for soul is the same in the film.  do you see that nun pay nun pay nun pay?  the differences is in the shin.  here this shin means the fire in the belly, the fire of God, the born, the begotten.  That's kind of what it's talking about.  And I can tell you a little bit more about the word.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to do it right now just a little bit.  On each of these little legs and the shin, there's a little attachment to it that is actually a yod.  So this actually tells you The letter Shin actually shows you where life, especially mankind, comes from, and how it's arranged.  A lot like the name of God that we know as Jehovah, a lot of you know as Jehovah, Yahweh, some of you pronounce it, but anyway, the YHVH.  Those things are very important, and they're very important into understanding what's going on here.  Because we know that the fallen angels... who were told not to do the things that they were doing, but they did it anyway.  They crossed over.  It's the same family, but it's kind of like having... I'll tell you what it was like.  The nearest thing that it would be would be like incest.  They came and performed incest.  That's kind of what it is.  Fallen angels.  Remember, it talked about them being the sons of God.  Saw that the daughters of men were fair and took them to life.  And then they're... their posterity became known as the Nephilim.  Well, what that means is, here we have the Nun, the Nun for the soul, the Pei, the Pei there, right?  But we're missing the Shin here.  They don't have the soul, the breath of God, the Spirit of God breathed into them.  No.  What they have is a desire to rule.  So in other words, they're soulless souls.  And even if they have souls, they're not begotten.  They're not begotten of God because they've gone outside of the parameters that God has set.  And I could get into a lot more depth on that.  I really don't think I should here.  For one thing, it would make it too long.  This is a very deep and a very complicated subject.  Okay, so it talks about, in Genesis.  there it says, and in those days there were giants in the earth.  The giant that they use, that is translated giant, is Nephilim, giants in the earth, who were men of old, men of renown.  Well, the idea of renown in Genesis, It lends itself to.  they're famous, they're strong, they're men of authority.  Let's see if I give you a couple of others here.  Men of honor.  well-known memorialized.  in other words they did something they were something and what they were is because of them looking to be like god to take his place.  they became forceful rulers.  they became the task masters.  that's what this lamed is.  a lamed is a flail.  In the old days, if you look at Egyptian hieroglyphics and Egyptian art and those things, and in some other areas, you'll see the pharaohs holding a shepherd's crook, which in Hebrew is a kof, and a lamed, a flail, lamed flail.  So in Hebrew... Often God will use the shepherd's crook, Koph, the letter Koph.  And I know you don't know what I'm talking about here right now, but Koph means a shepherd.  In other words, you know, you're a shepherd.  You're taking care of the sheep.  Lamed is justice, is force.  Notice that's all that's in here.  So in other words, what they're saying is that these were people that took authority.  Okay, they took over.  It doesn't mean that they were giants in the sense of physical stature.  Okay?  That's not what it's saying.  And I know this is going to throw a lot of people insane.  They're going to get upset about this.  But it's in the Hebrew.  It makes perfect sense.  The word for giant, meaning like Goliath, that kind of a giant, is rafa.  Resh, peh, aleph.  Rafa, the name of the angel Raphael, because he's a big dude, apparently.  Raphael's a big, big angel.  That's the actual word for giant.  It can also mean taking care.  In Hebrew, if you want to bless, ask God to bless somebody, send them blessings, it'll say, Let's say you.  And basically what that's saying is send the blessing, send the healing of the Lord God to you.  So it can mean that as well, but primarily the word for giant is Raphah.  It's not Nephil or Nephilim.  I wanted to just show that to you because these are very important to understand.  One last thing.  I want to break this down.  And I've talked about it before when I broke down Amen, for instance.  Amen.  I broke down Bereshit and some other words for you.  And I'm not going to get into all the rabbinic hermeneutics and prophetic methods and styles and all that.  But I am going to break this down again, just one more time, so that you see that the meaning of the letters themselves help you to understand what the word is.  And in this case, the Nun, Nun is a fish, but it also means a messenger.  Isn't that interesting?  The sons of God, messengers, angels, fallen angels.  Malak, it's very hard sometimes in Hebrew to tell the difference.  There's Melek, which is king.  And it's often spelled with a hate, but the correct version, the really true version, is with a kof.  But I'm not going to get into that discussion here either.  But at any rate, I keep getting off the subject.  Nun means a messenger, a winged, speedy messenger.  In other words, kind of the concept of an angel, which is the same thing as a malak in its entirety.  Malak means angel, but its kind of shorthand would be the nun.  Just this letter right here, winged, speedy messenger, nun, fish, messenger.  Peh means mouth.  It means messenger.  say something uh commands uh speech.  literally it means that okay.  and then the llama of course as i've already explained means flail or force or justice or rule without mercy because there's no kof there.  a kof.  a kof looks like this.  i'm just going to put it up there just so that you know what it is.  that's basically a kof.  i don't know if you can see that it's almost like a p There is no kof in there.  So these are not nice guys.  These are nasty, nasty people.  So I just wanted to break that down to you.  There's nothing in those words that lends any concept of somebody 8, 10, 12, 20, 30 feet tall.  It's not what it is.  It's talking about that.  they have an iron-fisted rule.  that they they demand loyalty they demand submission.  that's what it means.  okay and i think that we we know from the the story.  if you understand if you read isaiah and some of these other scriptures that talk about the war in heaven it talks about you know, the third of the hosts of heaven, and their leader wanted to take God's throne.  He wanted to force everybody to be good.  Does this sound like what's going on today?  It's why I talk about the, I remember this is a created being I'm talking about, not one of God's sons or daughters.  Boy, that starts a whole other argument too, but I'm just, just take it for what it's worth.  One of these created beings, one of these angels, the leader apparently, came in and said, well, I'll make this work, but I've got to take your throne.  In other words, I've got to take the place of your own family, your own sons and daughters.  And God said, no, you're not going to do that.  And he cast him and the third host of heaven out, right?  So that's who we're dealing with here.  And this is entirely different from most of Christian understanding.  Now, I've often told you that I don't tell information based on traditional concepts, because those traditional concepts have not been based on the Scriptures themselves.  When Jesus talked, and I've talked about this before, He was a strict... He followed the Torah strictly.  Let's put it that way.  He didn't believe in the statutes that the scribes and Pharisees added to the law, to the Torah.  He thought that that was wrong, that they shouldn't have done that.  They set up stakes that people couldn't pass, which was beyond the law.  And so I take the original scriptures, and I've talked about them before.  I'm not going to go into a lot of detail here.  But the concepts... that you get from the Torah, just from the letters and the words, and sometimes codes and very, very long letter chains come up with some pretty fantastic things.  So in this situation that you see here, you can see there's a relationship between the Nephil and the soul, the Nephah, Nefesh, rather, right here.  There is a relationship, but the difference is this has the seed of God in it.  This is nothing but tyrannical, forceful, authoritarian rule.  Now the question is, did they all die in the flood?  Well, we'll save that for another day.  I'll just say this.  I believe that the DNA of these guys was brought across from the deluge, and it's part of our problem today.  It's all I've got for you.  I could get into a whole lot of other things.  I could get into a spirit, you know, Ruach, God breathed his spirit into man and man became a living soul.  That breath, that spirit is Ruach in Hebrew.  By the way, it's interesting that the word for body is Geviyah.  Geviyah.  And the word for a corpse is as gufa.  have you ever heard of anybody say a gufa?  it's a gufa?  well they probably get it from that corpse.  dead stupid you know it's done.  no no intelligence it's.  you know the spirits left it.  um kind of an interesting thing.  okay i think that's all i'll cover on this one.  that's long enough.  that's probably going to be nuts enough for for most people.  So I hope that was of some interest.  Remember, this is called notarikon when you break the word down into its individual letters and get the meaning of those individual letters so that you can better understand the word.  It's not 100% all the time, especially in modern Hebrew.  You can't apply this in modern Hebrew.  You can't.  Only in biblical Hebrew.  But I wanted to show you that so that you would know that this does not mean that it's somebody 50 feet tall or 10 feet tall or 12 feet or whatever.  That's this word, okay?  This means that they were of authority, men of only rule, authority, well-known.  They memorialized themselves.  They made themselves into something bigger than what they really were.  In other words, they tried to take God's throne, just like the fallen angels that fathered them thought they could do.  All right, that's enough for today out here. ",
