            "text": "Black Ram 313 back at it again.  You know why?  It's because this is therapeutic, man.  Back again with another video, hence another therapy session.  Today's topic and title is why you should keep it casual and occasional.  The way we should deal with women as thinking men.  Knowing what we know, being enlightened, knowing female nature and knowing the gynocentric society in which we now live.  The question that I get often is how are we to exactly deal with the ladies in this day and age?  Now, this is a follow up video to the video that I've done a while back called The Catch and Release Method.  Check that out.  At this point, many of us are done with the traditional dating scene and with traditional relationships.  It's a waste of time no matter what.  So dating relationships should be seen by thinking men is something recreational only.  Pause and think about that.  Recreation only.  Nothing serious.  We should not be serious about the modern thought.  She has nothing to offer at all.  And you, my friend, have everything to lose in a relationship with her.  Therefore, the new motto and mantra is to keep it casual and occasional.  What does that mean?  It means a number of things.  And you can determine what it means for you.  But for me, it means no long phone conversations, no expensive dates, no spending large amounts of time with her, no buying gifts, no deep conversations, no vacation retreats.  You should be traveling to meet women, not traveling with women.  Shout out to S.Y.B.M.  and M. Weak.  Now, the only exception is that if you have a lady that you deem worthy to do such that you are currently dealing with.  But going forward, why put such an effort?  So here are five reasons.  To keep it casual and occasional.  So here we go.  Number one, wifey material does not exist.  You need a time machine to find her.  And I don't know if they've ever built one.  And if they did, you don't have one.  Now, other countries are slightly better than the U.S.  of A., but still fall short.  Chastity, being able to cook and clean and humility along with submission are rare characteristics that can be seen here and abroad.  For those who have that rare gem, salute to you.  But since it's rare, many of us will not find such.  Is it even worth looking?  Many will say no.  Number two, as to the reason why you should keep it casual and occasional when it comes to dating and relationships today.  Why you should not take such matters seriously is because number two, you have no real power in this society because you do not control rewards and punishments.  The government is the ultimate authority even in your relationship.  You don't sacrifice for what you don't own and control.  This society wants you to take all the responsibility, but with no authority.  Protect and provide for her while she gets to do whatever the hell she wants to do.  And she can leave you at any time with half your stuff if you are foolish enough to get that government contract.  Number three, as to the reason why we want to keep it occasional and casual, casual and occasional is because she is a thought.  Which means that she cannot pair bond, which means that she cannot develop deep emotions, which means that she cannot love you, which means that she will most likely cheat on you, which means she will always leave you.  which means that she is undeserving of your love provision and protection.  therefore you want to keep it casual and occasional.  number four is because she is strong and independent which means That she is loyal to this culture and this government, but not to you.  She has no allegiance to you.  She has no service toward you, no loyalty and no reverence.  Her reverence is to the government and to her job.  Accept this fact.  Believe it.  Internalize it.  And keep this in mind when she starts talking about what you as a man need to do for her.  Number five, as to the reason you want to keep it, what casual and occasional is because she has nothing.  And I mean, nothing to offer you as a man in most cases, unless she's at a rare gym.  She's rebellious, entitled.  She has a bad attitude.  She's selfish, narcissistic, mentally unstable.  She's stubborn, vindictive.  She's a liar, a cheater, a backstabber.  She's duplicitous and lacks self-control.  She's overly emotional, impulsive.  She cannot manage money.  She's broke, materialistic.  She's promiscuous and she wishes with all her heart.  If she's a succubus, she wishes that she was a snow bunny.  She's a terrible mother.  She lacks true empathy and much more.  All she has is the vag and even that is garbage because she has so many experiences being on the carousel for 10, 15, 20, 25, and in some cases, 30 years plus.  Think about that.  She has 20 to 30 years of experience on the carousel.  Like a career that you retire from and you want that to be your wife, a woman with 30 years of experience.  20 years of experience, 10 years of experience with different men.  Nasty, nasty.  So to close.  The best method, the new mantra from now on is casual and occasional.  We can chill sometimes, shorty, sure.  We can chill. ",
