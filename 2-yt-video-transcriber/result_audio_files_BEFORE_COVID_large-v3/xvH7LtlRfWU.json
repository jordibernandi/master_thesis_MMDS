            "text": "From the state that brought you the 2000 recount, we have Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz.  Gaetz attempts here to frame Nixon counsel and star witness during the Watergate scandal, John Dean, as someone who has no business offering historical context from the Nixon era as it relates to Trump, who is also facing possible impeachment like Nixon, for the same charges as Nixon.  Honestly, the stuff that Gates assumes Dean knows nothing about is quite literally what he's known for.  He's written more than half a dozen books on the topic, a point that Gates tried to frame as disqualifying rather than being clear evidence of his expertise.  Because in Gates' parallel universe, facts are subjective if they're not aligned with his agenda.  And clearly Gates was vying for some viral gotcha moment, except his disoriented line of questioning backfired on him.  He suggested that while Dean is on the subject of discussing stuff he isn't qualified to discuss, that he reveal how they plan to pay for Medicare for all, and then randomly named Richard Nixon when Dean asked for specifics.  Except... Nixon did have a health care plan.  And while he was no liberal icon, his health care plan was strikingly similar to Obamacare, which Republicans today have staked their entire careers on dismantling.  Nixon's plan combined an employer mandate with subsidized private coverage for the self-employed, unemployed, and others not covered through their jobs.  Not unlike Obamacare.  Nixon's plan also expanded Medicare to people under 65 who'd been disabled.  And he funded it all through higher taxes.  Through Gaetz's rambling desperation to point out that Dean isn't able to speak to facts, Dean was able to speak to facts.  But Gaetz went on, digging in his heels and pounding his fists while trying to prove that the Mueller probe was a sham.  He staked his argument on the idea that because Mueller didn't find that Trump was an agent of Russia, that the whole investigation was unwarranted.  Except, that was only one of multiple allegations.  There were others, including that Russian agents interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of then-candidate Trump, that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the outcome of the election, and that Trump obstructed justice.  But I guess Gates just conveniently forgot about those instances.  Because when it came to the other accusations that Mueller looked into during his two-year investigation, we now have definitive evidence of all of those things.  We know that Russian intelligence officers did meddle in the 2016 election, that they stole information from 500,000 American voters, that they hacked into emails from the DNC and Hillary Clinton, and then released them to help then-candidate Trump.  And Mueller's investigation resulted in 12 of them getting charged.  We know that the officials from the Trump campaign did in fact cooperate with people with ties to Russia, including the Trump Tower meeting in which Kushner, Manafort, and Don Jr.  met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer seeking dirt on Hillary Clinton, including when Mike Flynn discussed Russian sanctions with the Russian ambassador, including Paul Manafort sharing polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, who has ties to the Kremlin, and of course, including when Trump himself asked Russia on national television to hack Hillary Clinton's emails.  which they attempted to do only hours later.  We know that there were instances of obstruction of justice, all of which were outlined in Mueller's report, including trying to have the special counsel himself removed, dangling pardons for those cooperating with the probe, trying to intimidate others who were cooperating with the probe, and instructing White House counsel to lie about the probe, just to name a few.  And as much as Matt Gaetz and the White House would like to pretend that none of these glaringly obvious examples of wrongdoing exist, that's not how it works.  Gates doesn't get to say, well, Mueller didn't charge Trump as a Russian agent, so none of it counts.  In fact, after his performance, Gates really shouldn't be saying much of anything, because it seems to only hurt himself every time he does. ",
