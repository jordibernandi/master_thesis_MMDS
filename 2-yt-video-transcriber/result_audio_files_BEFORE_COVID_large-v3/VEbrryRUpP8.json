This is a clip from Epitome of Malourishment 3.  Most of you have likely seen it.  That was her 31.  Now she's 32.  She removed the video quickly, but I downloaded it in time because people were commenting about how old she looks.  She has a granny look, the gray hair.  Those wrinkles are way beyond her age.  Now you can see her with makeup, but she still looks way older than she should. ",

Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in your body.  It's found in your muscles, your bones, your skin, your digestive system, your tendons, and more.  It's what gives your skin strength and elasticity and also helps to replace dead skin cells.  our body's collagen production naturally slows down as we age and this is when we begin to see wrinkles or signs of aging.  so consuming extra collagen as a supplement has become all right.

Anyway, she's poisoning her viewers also, of course, because What this is, is firstly, pretty much pure sugar.  The sugar found in candies, pastries and so on, which even vegans call unhealthy, comes from fruit, beets, etc.  This is it?  Then you've got almond milk, calcifies your whole body, phytic acid, it doesn't let you absorb any of the minerals in the fruit. ",

Organic spirulina.  Even the vegans are starting to figure out that it's toxic.  A lot of wild plants, which they have no use for.  Those are waste products.  And you buy it like idiots.  Anyway, this smoothie... And her diet overall doesn't have over 50 nutrients.  Stop following this religion.  It's going to age.  you just like her.  She understands that you're concerned about the aging.  She knows it because she went through the same.  She's using you.  Thanks for watching, guys. ",
