Fox News lies!  Fox News lies!  Fox News lies!  This week, a plethora of misogynistic, racist, xenophobic comments were unearthed of Tucker Carlson's where he called Iraqis monkeys, where he defended statutory rape.  The list goes on and on.  And people are protesting that advertisers are still buying time on his program. ",

But what we do expect is that advertisers will respond to the bottom line, which is money.  And what we're saying is that Fox is bad for business.  And in particular, women are actually huge economic drivers.  Women are the targets of a lot of advertisements, actually.  And frankly, if you want women to buy your products, you can't advertise on Fox News.  And that's the message we're sending. ",

We're not buying it, and we are sure as hell not buying from the companies that profit off of it.  One of the ideas and the parts of the agenda is to promote the notion that the left is deeply anti-Semitic, which makes their cause feel righteous.  But underneath all of that is this notion that it is totally acceptable to engage in bigotry against Muslims or any other.  And that's the part where I think the tension really starts to come in because her attack on Muslims, suggesting that Omar, Representative Omar, is somehow violating the Constitution by wearing a hijab, I think reveals that it isn't just a matter of promoting one side.  There's always a second part of the coin when it comes to Fox News.  So while they're driving a wedge, they're also simultaneously advancing a pretty disturbing perspective. ",
