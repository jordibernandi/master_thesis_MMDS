            "text": "Hello, YouTube.  As I'm sure you know, today is the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, and, well, I've received quite a few messages from people asking if I'm doing a new video to coincide with this anniversary.  Well, you'll be happy to know that I have such a video in the works, and, well, it should be out in time for the splashdown anniversary on July 24, but first I have a little public service announcement.  This is a, well, a very serious matter.  There's no light way of putting this, but it's a matter of copyright infringement.  As I'm sure you know, quite a few years ago I acquired the copyrights to Ralph Rene's book, NASA Mooned America.  And, well, I've been keeping it in print much the same way that he did, printing them and thermally bounding them myself.  And, well, it's a labor of love.  You know, I can throw hundreds and hundreds of dollars into getting these books printed.  And, well, I don't expect to make a profit on it, but I expect to be... to see some marginal return whenever the thing sells.  Some marginal return on the printing costs.  Well, I regret to inform you that Amazon has illegally published an outdated version of the book.  If you go on to Amazon.com and search NASA Mooned America, you'll find there is an edition of Ralph Rene's book published on July 15, 2017.  And, well, it says here it's been published by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, which I understand is owned by Amazon.  They did not get my permission in writing to publish this book.  They have essentially taken an outdated copy of Rene's book and illegally published it.  This is essentially commercial rape.  As I said, I can throw hundreds and hundreds of dollars into getting these books printed and thermally bound, spend several days on it, and well, I don't expect to make a profit on it, but I expect to be reimbursed somewhat whenever the thing sells.  Suddenly, Amazon has come along, and I see no reward, and they're selling an outdated and therefore inferior version of the book.  Not only does the current edition have a few appendixes added, but it also includes a previously... A previously unpublished essay by Renee at the end, as a bonus feature.  Well, obviously you're not going to get that in the 1994 edition.  So, I've tried to get the Amazon copy pulled, and well, they refuse to do it.  They tell me, oh, show us where we've infringed our copyright in your purchase.  Yeah, they want me to purchase it before I can get them to take it down.  Why should I have to pay for a copy of my own book?  That's bullshit.  You know, in fact, it actually has a look inside thing, and you can compare it.  If you have a copy of the current edition, you can compare it, and you can see they've lifted it.  Some of it remains the same, but others have obviously been changed and updated here and there.  So my message to you is, if you're going to purchase NASA Moon to America, purchase it from ralphrene.com.  This is the legal, authorized copy of Ralph Rene's book.  Do not buy the Amazon copy.  The Amazon copy is an illegal and outdated piracy. ",
