            "text": "The policy that central banks pursue of trying to stimulate the economy early in the cycle and hope that that will soften or remove the depression and then everything carries on as normal, time and time and time again has been disproved.  What we do know, if you just think it through, is that the initial stimulus into the economy, the rescuing of businesses which should otherwise go bust, all those things create problems for later.  It stores up problems for later.  This time round, the cycle has got, if you like, sort of completely swamped in money.  The idea that an economy consists of... consumers who consume now and put aside some money for deferred consumption in the form of savings, which is used as capital by producing entrepreneurs to produce the products for tomorrow, which you and I, in their judgment, are going to want tomorrow, and they fail or succeed on the basis of that judgment.  That sort of thing, where we're all at the same time consumers, savers, and producers, they have tried to do away with that, in effect.  And this goes back to something that Keynes expressed as a wish in his general theory.  He wished for the euthanasia of the rentier, in other words, the saver.  He thought that savers were completely superfluous.  That is where we've got because we are continually destroying the value of savers by producing yet more and more money.  If you produce more and more money, basically over a period of time, that works into the economy and reduces the purchasing power of the existing money.  So if you're a sensible, well-brought-up person, going back to the family values, and you have saved some of your money, let's say, to put down on a deposit of the house, you've got this constant fight of trying to have something that's going to retain value.  And then it is taxed as well, which makes it worth even less.  I mean, why bother saving?  We are now a credit society.  And the whole idea that we are, at the same time, consumer, producer, and saver, and it all works around that, you know, with a division of labor.  And the role of money is to facilitate those things and do nothing else but just to facilitate those things.  That has now changed.  And this is very dangerous. ",
