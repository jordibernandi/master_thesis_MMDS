            "text": "You got to be aware of certain things.  And when we're talking about this leaving Neverland, it's on the wave of the Me Too movement.  It's on the wave of surviving R. Kelly.  So you better believe and understand that some jokers are thinking it's going to have the same effect.  Okay.  But then we got to look even further.  We got people coming out making accusations after a man is dead.  A man who can't even defend himself.  And two guys who accuse him.  And just remember this.  Both Robeson and Safechuck gave witness statements in defense of Jackson, saying that he never done anything inappropriate with them.  So now they want to come out and say the complete opposite.  What does that mean?  You can't trust these people.  Got a little shady background.  Some things that will come out.  When we go to listening to them, we must understand that there's also things that have happened that pertain to this specific topic that you need to know.  And that is people coming out lying about sexual predators.  And they have all these elaborate stories.  For example, we have Isaac Cappy, who is a part of the COINTELPRO operation that's not supposed to be going on.  Now, it may be under a different name, but sure enough, he is a COINTELPRO agent lying.  He lied on people like Tom Hanks, Seth Green, called them sexual predators.  Man was calling everybody sexual predators.  And he had nefarious reasons for doing so.  He pretended to be a conspiracy theorist to make it seem like anybody who questions the government is an idiot who just goes out making these claims.  So then it would mean that any other what they call conspiracy claims, they must not hold any weight because this is all they do.  They just go out and throw out misinformation harmful.  So what happened with this guy, the media, we got like Daily Beast right here talking about him right now.  And what they were supposed to do or what they were doing was to demonize anybody questioning the government, to demonize conspiracy theories by propping up this fake conspiracy theories.  Okay, whatever.  We understand that now.  But there's something further from this playing backfires because what we have now is an example of somebody who lies about people being sexual predators.  It's on record.  I'm saying that, that the guy is lying, and the media is also saying that the guy is lying.  Now, put this in your awareness, there are people that lie about other people being sexual predators.  So then, when you see those people in the Leaving Neverland documentary, Yeah, you can listen to what they have to say.  But at the same time, understand that there are people that lie about people being sexual predators.  And not only that, but it's from HBO.  And HBO is notorious for putting out unethical hit pieces.  people on record so they don't have as much credibility as you think.  I'm gonna show you what reaction they want you to have.  and Emma let you hear what Michael Jackson had to say to me warned you already that they're trying to lie to you and trying to make him look bad because of certain things.  but let's let's go on to what they tell you.  enough is enough.  Michael Jackson's music is dead to me now And it's coming from this lady right here.  Nothing should interfere with my personal listening pleasure.  Nothing at all.  Great art is often made by terrible people.  These truths I have held to be self-evident.  Okay, so she's going to go on.  And she's just like she's 100% believing the jokers in the video saying these claims that have no proof.  This mop-headed trick.  Who is this?  Who is this token?  Why do we listen to her?  Why should we change our minds because of what she said?  We don't know who paying her.  And again, the media has been trying to make Michael Jackson look bad for the longest.  There's already been an investigation on that man for 10 years and he was found innocent.  So with that being said, I'm gonna leave you with what Michael had to say.  They killed him because he had too much power, too much influence.  They didn't like that.  he owned half of Sony.  And you would like to say, oh, but that's conspiracy and stuff.  No, you trick joker.  Michael Jackson himself said, it's a complete conspiracy. ",

They usually are broken, torn, and usually just sad, and the story is very sad in the end, because the companies take advantage of them.  They really do.  And, you know, being the artist that I am at Sony, I've generated several billion dollars for Sony.  Several billion.  And they really thought that my mind is always on music and dancing, and it usually is, but they never thought that this performer myself would out-think them.  Yeah!  So we can't let them get away with what they're trying to do because now I'm a free agent.  I just owe Sony one more album.  It's just a box set, really.  I can do the box set and just give them any two songs.  So I'm leaving Sony a free agent, owning half of Sony.  So, I own half of Sony's publishing and I'm leaving them and they're very angry at me because of it, but I just... I just did good business, you know?
