            "text": "People have been exchanging goods and ideas on a global scale for millennia.  But in the past few decades, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the opening up of capital markets, the rise of information technology, and the reduction in trade tariffs, the pace of global connectivity has greatly increased, as many countries and people have entered into a single global economy of exchange.  Although the initial phases of economic globalization may be behind us today, soaring flows of cross-border data channeled through the Internet are taking globalization to new levels.  Today, one billion people are coming online every five years as digital platforms are coordinating ever more spheres of economy and society.  The level of globalization fostered by the information revolution is altogether unprecedented in human history, as the speed with which information, transactions, and capital can travel virtually anywhere on the planet enables the sustained coordination of human activity at a new scale and level of complexity.  Public institutions have proven effective at delivering sustainable solutions to the management of the global economy on its different levels.  The industrial-age macro-scale management structure of the nation-state has not transformed to meet the demands of an emerging set of global networks that require a new form of management structure that is today significantly lacking, and this has many systemic detrimental effects.  Global institutions built on the framework of the nation-state, like the World Bank, WTO, IMF, and United Nations, although effective in some ways, are ultimately an incomplete solution to global governance, as they are piecemeal, undemocratic, often ineffective, and have not created the desired results.

            "text": "The form of hyperglobalization that expanded around the turn of the millennium was based on neoliberal economic theory.  It was marked by a reduction in trade barriers, the development of outsourcing and global supply chains, the privatization of state assets, and the shift of power from national legislation to multinational institutions, the massive expansion of the global financial market, and the formation of the global cities network.  But the financial crisis was to bring this massive expansion in economic exchange to a shattering end.  The global flow of goods, finance, and services flattened.  The well-accepted truths of the free market became reopened for questioning, as multinational organizations like the IMF and World Bank have come to have less influence.  Through the financial crisis, the political establishment in developed economies became increasingly delegitimatized, as nationalism began to once again expand.  While many speculated about the end of globalization, underneath the ashes the seeds for the next era of globalization had already been sown, as a revolution in information technology was continuing unabated.  The model for globalization was transforming.  The globalization of today is no longer driven by increasing exchange of goods, but instead information and services.  While political organization remains divided, soaring flows of cross-border data are taking global integration to new levels.  As we approach 4 billion people connected to the Internet, these huge flows of data and the platforms that orchestrate them have become the new architecture to globalization.  The story of globalization as it has unfolded over the past decades has been one of a new set of information technologies enabling the development of a global economic and financial system that brings humanity into a commonly shared value system mediated by markets.  In the past, the linkage between the underlying information technology and the institutional structures that resided on them was not apparent.  Globalization was seen to be driven by the institutional structure of the multinational corporation, of trade-free agreements, of financial markets and the physical connectivity of the global city and global air and shipping networks.  But after the financial crisis, this started to change.  As the underlying information technology began to mature, there was an inflection point.  Everything was starting to shift into the realm of technology and information.  But I think what happened with the financial crisis was this period. ",
