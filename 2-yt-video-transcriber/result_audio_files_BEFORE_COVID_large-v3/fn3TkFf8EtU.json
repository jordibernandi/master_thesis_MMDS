            "text": "I'm gonna tell you guys something very interesting.  We're gonna answer the question Is it better in Judaism to be more strict or no?  Now my dear tell me die initially said yes more the more stringent you heard.  Naomi said no no he's no good.  Yes good Everybody's confused.  why?  because one had since It's good to be stringent.  We heard from the story of Rabbi Vadya.  He was stringent in regards to shaking hands.  It's good.  Thank you.  But, but, sometimes it's not good.  One is not good.  We heard a different story yesterday.  Rabbi Mordechai Eliau, somebody came to him, one of the Avrachim came to him and said, Rabbi, can I, from now on, Get your permission to wear my feeling all day so I can study while I'm wearing feeling all day like the said.  he came in the gmaa And I bought the highly always says no Why no even though it's a mitzvah even though it's fantastic.  He says if this Addition this additional stringency Will make you think in your heart that you're better than everybody else in the corel One time your whole life.  It's not worth it.  Why would you think you're better?  because you have 500 people in the column and you're the only one that's put on feeling.  So this thing is gonna be distinguishable.  So in essence, even if they're not saying anything to you, you're gonna see yourself.  You say wait, I'm wearing three.  Nobody else went feeling you're gonna feel good about yourself If you feel good about yourself that you're better than anybody else one time in your entire life.  and that's essence that that dust of Pride enters your heart.  It was better off.  You never added the strings.  Why?  because that's how much Hashem hates pride.  and So we see that stringency has a time and place.  Now, the interesting part is that in both cases, there's a permission from the Torah to do, there's a permission from the Torah not to do.  Meaning, the Avrech came to his rabbi, says, it says in the Torah to do it, but the rabbi said no.  Why?  Because he knows the student, in essence, the rabbi is right for saying no.  At the time of rabbi vadya there is a leniency to shake hands, but the rabbi said no.  why?  because it and so on and so forth Meaning that it's not black and white.  But in both case you see that there is.  it's not just a black and white law.  There's also something called da'at Torah the opinion of the Torah based on this specific situation.  What happens when you do not seek the opinion of the Torah?  and you seek your own opinion.  and I mean, after all, Tzelem Elokim, HaKadosh Baruch Hu created you in his image, no?  You're so special, your opinion should count for something.  No?  After all, you're smart, you finished a few Masechtot in the Gemara, some people even call you Rabbi.  You know, Chacham, Chacham, no?  Your opinion, no?  The Gemara in Masechet Yevamot says someone that does not seek the assistance of a rabbi, meaning someone that does not ask his rabbi questions, and in essence becomes their own rabbi, the Gemara in Masechet Yevamot, page 109b, says HaKadosh Baruch Hu hates this person.  Why?  Because in essence they're so proud that they think they know everything.  And we have One of the stories that you can listen.  if you understand what I'm about to say to you you may have to Grab out your chairs.  Some time ago, I told you of a story that's in the Gemara Masechet Chaya page 4b.  It says that There was a certain woman that the Satan decided to take out of the world, but by mistake Mistake.  I Love BV.  one of the tonight Was friends with the satan.  satan likes said he came.  So he came to him.  He says you want to see let me show you what I do?  He said yeah so The BB was shown by the satan how the satan takes out national.  so Satan tells one of his servants, go bring me the neshama of Miriam the caretaker.  Go bring me.  And the servant goes, brings the neshama, here's Miriam.  Satan tells him, hey, it's the wrong Miriam.  I didn't ask you for this Miriam.  It's the wrong medium.  Okay, so should I bring this one back?  No, this one, leave it anyway.  Go bring the other one anyway.  We have to bring it.  It's time for her to die.  So it's a peculiar story.  And then we go into the details, how, who, what, when, and how.  But we're not going to go into that because we've already discussed that in the past.  But just remember, now who is this medium?  And why does she deserve to die?  No name is mentioned.  if it was just some woman Then it doesn't matter who she is then why would I mention a name?  If it's your name is mentioned.  There's a reason for it meaning the significance here of who and what and how.  Who is this Miriam?  You're not gonna find that in a grandma.  say it.  I got page for me.  I You're going to find it somewhere else.  You have to go to Gemara Masechet Gittin.  Last page, page 90.  Gemara Masechet Gittin says, what are the appropriate ways for a woman to behave and for a husband to let a woman behave?  He says there are some husbands that the way they eat is the way they treat their wife in essence.  And some people if they see a fly in their drink fly in their drink they take the fly out and Drink the water.  He says that's normal.  That's a normal husband.  That's a person that allows his wife to deal with regular people Not to banter around and start talking to every guy on the street and so on.  But if it's family if it's friends if it's hello, it's goodbye.  general basic behavior.  He's the bank teller.  Here's the money.  Thank you very much.  basic stuff normal necessary conversation.  Back then, You know if if you weren't rich you are gonna throw out the water right away.  So someone that just saw there's something that's flying their water it would take it out and drink it not mean essence makes them normal.  Representing a normal husband a normal husband which in essence he allows his wife to act normal.  if there's a let's say UPS guy comes to the house.  She's able to answer the door.  I thank you very much.  Goodbye takes the box.  No problem It's a lot.  take the box.  She's not hugging the guy.  I Not saying, hey, how's your family?  Where's your kids?  Where are you guys vacation?  No, that's not allowed.  But just basic conversation.  Thank you very much.  No problem.  That's normal.  Normal behavior.  No problem.  Says then there's a guy that's a Rasha.  What's this guy?  that's a Rasha?  Guy that's a Rasha that allows his wife Go out without modesty Sleeveless and without kisui rosh and he doesn't care.  He doesn't care Even if she goes into a bathhouse, and there's still men there.  He's like a guy that sees the fly and drinks the fly with the water.  He doesn't care about nothing.  That's Rasha.  Then there's a guy that sees the fly, throws out the fly and the water together.  He throws out everything.  He says that's extreme fanatic behavior.  Like who?  Like a person by the name of Papus Ben Yehuda.  Who's Papus Ben Yehuda?  Papus Ben Yehuda lived at the time of the Gemara.  It says that Papus Ben Yehuda saw that his wife was one of the most beautiful women alive.  Something special.  And he says there's no way that people are not going to look at her.  No way.  So, for modesty reasons, for modesty reasons, honey, whatever you need, I'll get it for you.  Go on Amazon.com, order whatever you want.  You don't need to go to the store.  You don't need to go to the mall.  You want something, I'll give it to you.  But you're not allowed to leave the house.  Not allowed to leave the house.  No store, no deli, no work, nothing.  Whatever you need, I'll bring it to the house.  No problem.  And Papu's been Yudah.  Papu's been Yudah.  Would leave the house and lock the door behind him not allowing his wife to leave the house.  The most she can do was look outside the porch to see the outside.  And the Gemara says this waiting is a mitzvah.  you think she's modest because of this.  you think he's a tzaddik.  because of this Says look what happened on Yom Kippur?  on Yom Kippur Papus his wife Miriam Same Iliyam from the Gemara HaMaseh HaHagigayit says.  She's had it.  Papu says to her, I'm going to Shul, Tadik.  Fasting, pray all day, see you tomorrow.  He leaves.  He leaves.  And Rabotai Yekarim is going.  This guy called Yosef Pendira.  Notice as the husband left, and he knows Miriam from back in the day.  He goes, Miriam, Miriam, when are you ever going to come out?  And Miriam says, she's so annoyed already.  She hasn't been out of the house in so long.  She says, Yosef, when are you going to save me?  He says, today.  Climps to the house takes out of the house and they run away together and sin adultery on Yom Kippur.  On Yom Kippur Now Abotai We say what happened from the sin?  What happened from the sin is they had a son Dersan, who's Dersan?  Dersan Rabotai, don't drop the gun yet.  Don't start naming names yet.  Don't start naming names.  Not nice.  Dersan Rabotai.  is named in the Gemara, Masechet Shabbat.  But if you read Masechet Shabbat, unless you know what Rav Ephraim, sheikh here, wrote in his Akhtom L'Yisrael, Chalek Bet, all the commentary from the Hatam Sofer and other Chachamim, you're not going to know what it says in Masechet Shabbat.  Why?  Because when you go to Masechet Shabbat, page 104b says, are we allowed to draw on our hands?  Draw on our hands, make marks on our hands with our fingers.  Is that violating Shabbat?  Is that considered writing?  says well, it should be considered writing because they There was a person by name of Ben Siddata.  Ben Siddata he wrote all types of witchcraft on his skin all types of wind draft on his skin and Because anytime you would get the witchcraft the Egyptians would catch you at the border and they want you to take the witchcraft with you because that's their in essence That's their possession.  That's their stuff.  So he couldn't write the spells on paper.  So he wrote on his skin.  So he wrote it.  He wrote on his skin and it worked.  Gemara says, no, no, we don't learn.  We don't learn halachot from crazy people.  So the Baalei HaTosfot says, who is this Ben Siddetah?  Who is this Ben Siddetah?  Ben Siddetah means Ben Sotah, the son of the wayward woman.  Who's the wayward woman?  The Hatam Sofer says the wayward woman is the same Miriam that cheated on her husband, Papus Ben Yehuda, with Yosef Ben Dita.  So who is the son?  Okay, this is the wayward woman.  She cheated.  Hatam Sofer says a chidush of a lifetime.  Who's the son?  Yeshu, the Christian.  Yeshu with his name and memory.  That's how he came to the world.  From what?  From his mother cheating on our original husband with some goy.  That's how Yeshu came to the world, rabotai.  Where did he come from?  Mitzvah.  Modesty.  There's a modesty in our life.  Who asked you to be that modest?  You lock yourself in a house.  Meaning, rabotai, that when a person does not listen to Da'at Torah and double checks themselves, even your mitzvah can turn into the biggest sin that's ever happened in history.  How many millions of Jews have died because of this sin?  That looks like a mitzvah.  She wanted to be modest inside the house.  He wanted her to be modest inside the house.  No guy ever sees, no one ever sees her.  Who asked you to do this?  Who asked you?  there are a logic permissions to do certain things.  there are logic restrictions to not do certain things.  a person needs to know what to do what not to do based on the torah not based on their logic.  now when a person takes things to their own mind and they start deciding this is the halacha.  this is comes from pride because they assume they're right and they don't have to double check.  all of us have pride.  This is why Akadosh Baruch Hu had mercy on us and he allowed us to write the oral Torah as well.  Why?  Because now we can't use this pride as an excuse.  Why?  Because you could find out whether you're right or wrong by simply asking your rabbi, by simply looking at the Torah.  Is what you said and what you think written in a book in a Torah?  Or is it simply your own idea that you're trying to be overly righteous?  Don't be overly righteous.  Don't be more righteous than what the Torah says.  So does that mean that every woman could just talk to anybody?  No.  Does that mean that every woman has to be closed up and be so modest that no one ever sees her?  No.  So what does it mean then?  It means you have certain things.  That's what we're going to go over now. ",
