            "text": "Hello there.  So the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered the Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay to sign a law next week that will take us out of the EU.  But what is it?  And what does it really mean?  A lot has been made of the decision by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to tell the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, to sign a law in the next few days that it is said will trigger Brexit.  The new chair of the European Research Group, Steve Baker, who took over from Jacob Rees-Mogg when the Mogster became the leader of the House, said, It is absolutely totemic.  It shows a transformation in the approach that Boris Johnson is willing to leave on a fixed date with no question of extension.  It's the do-or-die pledge in black and white.  It's not merely symbolic.  Once it's signed, that's it.  The UK is leaving.  And the news has some on social media hoping that somehow Brexit will be delivered next week once this piece of paper has been signed off.

And as far as I can see, it won't take us out of the EU on its own next week.  I had a gander around the interweb and couldn't find that much info on these things, not even a book you could buy, so I relied on the .gov and thinktank websites for what little I could glean.

Anyway, when an Act of Parliament is given Royal Assent, unless otherwise stated in the Act itself, it would come fully into force at midnight on the day it was given Royal Assent.  But within the text of many Acts of Parliament, especially the longer and more complex ones that cover a wide range of policy areas, there is a section called Commencement.  Within that commencement section will be instructions on when certain parts of the Act become effective in law, and that would either be on a later stated date or when a commencement order has been issued by a minister.  As an example, certain sections of the Data Protection Act 2018 only became effective a few days ago when the relevant commencement order was signed.  and one archive document I read said, The Easter Act 1928, which.
