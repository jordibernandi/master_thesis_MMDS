She was the first girl I was happy to have.  She was the first girl I was happy to have.  She was the first girl I was happy to have.  She was the first girl I was happy to have.  She was the first girl I was happy to have.  She was the first girl I was happy to have.  The whole world, I mean all the Palestinians, participated.  It's not more than that.  It's true, it's gone, and this is our path, a peaceful path.  We don't carry weapons or anything.

We demand our rights.  We are for every country.  We are for every home.  For those who are displaced, they can come to their homes.  As for the people, I say they are all sitting in the world watching us, everyone is relaxed.  We have a fence, no fence, no work, no anything.  Where do they want to go?  .  . ",
