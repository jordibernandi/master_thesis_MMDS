The reason most people will not do the thing that they want to do in life is because they're afraid.  Afraid of rejection, afraid of what people think, judgment, afraid of how they'll think about themselves if they fail, right?  This is most people.  This is why most people are not living lives of abundance, going around traveling with their own business, beautiful women, doing whatever they want to because they're living in fear.  The more you're free to be who you are truly, the more you kind of fall in love with yourself.  And that's really what this is about.  Just falling in love with who you are.  It's going to be a really fun, transformative weekend.  You haven't done it before, but I've done them a lot.  And you will not be the same person three hours from now than you are now.  I'm pretty scared what we're going to do today.  And I've been feeling it since yesterday as well.  And if you saw your perfect type of woman walk by where you absolutely thought she was gorgeous and you fell instantly in love with her, could you come up to her right now and just have a conversation?  No, no way. ",

So he's kind of into it.  He was totally happy.  I'm like, wow, he's been sitting there for a while now on this first date.  So the next one, when they say no, it's the ultimate, you just go, and you just stand there, just destroy it, and they'll walk away, and you're just there.  I'm now holding the camera myself, because the cameraman, who's also an ex-student, was like, I got to go talk to that girl, and he ran off.  So yeah, having the skills can be a negative, I guess.

I just go and meet her, talk to her, introduce myself.  Are you nervous?  No, not anymore.  I mean, you may have it, but I know how to own it.

Guys would do the course and the guys that kept doing the homework, which you'll learn about, But the guys that kept doing what they're supposed to do, their whole lives would change completely.
