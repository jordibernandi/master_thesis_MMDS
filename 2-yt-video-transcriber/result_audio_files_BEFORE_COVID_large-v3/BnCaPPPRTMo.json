            "text": "I was sent something this week, it's kind of light-hearted, and it involves the cat again.  Oh my.  The religion of the holy cat is from Egypt, which I have said in previous shows.  Look at the word of that religion, or the holic, like alcoholic.  indicating a person having an abnormal desire for or dependence on.  And when you put holic with cat, then you see where it comes from.  So the question is, is the holy C really S-E-E or S-E-A?  Or is it symbolizing the letter C as in the holy cat, which is highly prevalent in Egyptology, which is where that animal came from.  Now the word holy in French, which is predominantly Latin, means saint, which has a far more earthly based connotation than what is described as holy.  People will know the family St.  Clair.  was Sinclair and given these elements of society seem to think they are above and beyond everyone else with titles and all kinds of fake honors etc.  is the word holy just another title of a group of people who have elevated opinions of themselves?  the holy bible the holy sea cataholic?  to add to that piece I was watching a series on Cleopatra and the story of Egypt and Rome which appears to echo all the elements of the Bible in regards to royalty, decadence and debauchery thrown in with a whole heap of incest.  Then I remembered the theory that Mark Antony was put forward as the person known as Jesus and how Rome and Egypt both are land.  It certainly fits the timeline of events according to their history anyway.  But I got thinking about the term royals and in particular what is classed as the main royal around the world now.  She's head of the Commonwealth.  She's also head of the Social Security in America.  Oops.  And the term E.R.  which they say is about elizabeth regina.  now elizabeth is her name.  reg means king and regina means queen.  so it all fits elizabeth queen.  but one wonders whether er really means A marriage of Egypt and Rome.  The cat.  The sphinx.  The philonoids.  The serpent.  And Rome with its holy cat-holic.  I can feel the cat police prodding me in the back of the head now.  History will show.  It always does. ",
