It's my 51st birthday, actually.  It's June 29th, 2019.  And exactly one year ago today, on June 29th, 2018, I was arrested on my 50th birthday on the front lawn of the Mormon Temple in South Jordan, Utah.  They got me for trespassing.  I was literally just a few feet inside the front gate, and they had a cow about it.  So that was fun.  When that happened, I had two friends with me.  And one of those two friends, fun fact, was Tanner Gilliland.  In fact, here is Tanner actually capturing the moment that the police showed up at the temple. ",

I don't know if you call him a group.  He is half of Zelf on the Shelf.  If you're not familiar with Zelf on the Shelf, I'll show you a little compilation clip of some of the videos they've done at the end of this introduction.  I think Tanner Gilliland and Samantha Shelley, Zelf on the Shelf, I think they are two of the most intelligent, artistic, creative, inspiring young people Americans that I have had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of in my entire life, honestly.  If you're not familiar with Zelf on the Shelf, you are seriously missing out.  I'll post a link to their Patreon account in the description of this video.  They're spectacular.  I personally subscribed.  In fact, I just recently doubled my monthly subscription donation to them via their Patreon account, which I will post a link to.  In fact, maybe I can post a thing to it right here.  Here's a little link.  So, long story short, I found out a couple of months ago that Zelf on the Shelf is lacking basic equipment needed to edit videos.  Tanner actually like borrows a video or a computer from a friend of his to edit a lot of videos.  He has an old laptop that works about once every two weeks or five minutes.  It's ridiculous.  These guys need some serious equipment.  They need some good sound equipment.  They need a new computer.  They need a computer.  The computer they have is ridiculous.  I'm trying to raise $5,000.  No, scratch that.  I am raising $5,000 for Zelf on the Shelf.  This will help them create some spectacular new videos.  And they're going to, you know, they're going to make America great again.  So join me, if you would please, in chipping in a little money to Zilf on the Shelf.  I will personally be contributing $100 to this effort to raise money for them.  And I would encourage all of my friends and or family members to do the same.  100 bucks if you can't do 100.  Try 50.  If you can't do 50, ah, 5, 10 bucks.  Whatever you can do, it adds up.  And after, you know, a few hundred donations, we're going to have $5,000 for these kids.  So, chip in, money, today, let's make it happen.  Your name, Noah, out. ",
