So I've had the opportunity to preach in the Jordan River or at the Jordan and also Mount of Transfiguration.  And now Mars Hill and the Sea of Galilee.  most high taking us through those um very historical places because i believe this is the awakening after the message.  hula and i were in in conversation and i was like you know what we probably need to record this.  so tell it tell tell the world what we was discussing.

Yeah.  The Elohim of the universe is not asking you this.  He's asking for you to worship him in righteousness.  And this is how you do this.  You are building these places and creating them.  And it's not, it's not real.  It's not anything that's going to secure you, um, in life and in the life after this life.  And so he tells them, like, if you worship, yeah, it's one.  You only have to appeal to one Elohim and you only have to do what he says to do.  Not all these little gods and this patron of this and this god of this and this god of the underworld.  Then it gets just too confusing. ",

And so because they didn't really understand, they were afraid to not worship a particular god who may be the one of judgment.  And that's kind of the one Paul said, well, the one that you don't know about, the unknown one, he's the one you're going to have to face.  And he basically, you have no clue.  But he said, I'm going to preach to you.  I'm going to tell you him.  And then Dionysus is the one of all the people.  One of the most powerful men in Athens heard the message and was like, whoa, it makes sense.  A lot of people that are still caught up in religion.  um that doesn't mean that they're not still searching.  they just need someone to bring the truth.  so so that it will start things will start clicking.

They also ended up there because they were from Italy.  And Rome kicked them, was kicking Jews, Yehudians, out of Rome.  Probably because of the same thing.  You're not following the rules.  You're not going along with this.  You're stirring up a lot of trouble.  Because you're trying to keep your Torah-based religion in a landlocked place.  polytheistic polytheistic and so they kicked them out.  so that's how they meet up there and they were Jews.  so we mentioned the Bereans who were a group that lived in Berea and they were Jews.  they weren't Christians.  Christianity hadn't came around yet.  so it shows you that there were groups of Yehudian living here and not just Jews.

So when Paul goes out and he's preaching, he's grouping up with Yehudim who already know Torah.

He never taught a new message.  In other words, how would the Bereans, that's why I mentioned it in my introduction, how would the Bereans have any material to research what Paul was preaching if he was starting some new religion?  That makes no sense whatsoever.  They would not have had a Christian literature.  They would not have nothing.  They had only Torah.  So when Paul preached the resurrection of Christ, of Hamashiach from the dead by the power of Yah, they had to go to what we call the law and the prophets and the writings.  Genesis, in most of our, the way our books are set up, Genesis to Revelation or Genesis to the end of the Chronicles to find that message.  And they did it according to the text.  And they proved that the things that we're saying was true.  And the reason that I'm really emphasizing that is because when you come here, You start to see the timeline, whereas I think for some reason in America, the timelines seem to be always blurred. ",

Everything is based on, everything literally kind of jump starts out of, or it got really blurry too, which is Europe.  So Protestant religion is so far down the timeline, but everything is focused in Protestant religion, which you've already passed over, you know, Yeshua, you've gone through, now Islam is in, like all these other things that happen by the time you get to the Church of England.  And what we experience in America is based upon the split from the Catholic Church in the Church of England, And the Church of England and those people that came over here.  So we don't really get all this other history because to them, being English, being American, they're important.  The importance to them is what they were able to establish once they came over.  to America.  after splitting, they had already had hundreds of years of Catholicism.

So if you talk about Semiramis and Tammuz, you're talking about working that all the way down through history.  So what Rome did was we cannot compete with this story of this one who was born from a God.  I'm going to give it to you in their terms, from a God.  We cannot compete with this woman who was spoken to by God and had this child.  Now this child has redeemed all these people.  There's no story like that in the history of mankind.  Nobody had been resurrected.  And resurrection was, I think, outside of Torah.  Because the one who has power to give resurrection has to be the one who has power to give life.  And everyone knows that gods made of wood and stone don't have power to give life.  So when Rome hears this message, it's like, we can't fight it.  So the best thing to do is then merge it.  Let's build a temple to this god.  and we don't really even in roman culture we're not even really going to focus on the yohoshua character.  we don't like that because see in rome caesar is god.  so i can't make a man a god.  i can't have this human figure that's god.

So if you actually go up.  you ever get the opportunity and we'll show in the picture.  if you go up to the um acropolis which is that hill over there where uh maury filled film from and you on the other side they actually built a church to saint mary inside of the side of the place that houses all their gods and they made mercer in.  that's what rome saw as a solution.  and then if you look at the roman catholic church and how it has consistently gone over time, that has become that thing.  So you never get a grown man, Yahushua, that redeems.  You always get Mary, woman, with this baby.  And they keep him in the context of that baby because it keeps him small, makes her to be worshipped, and makes Caesar, or whoever is the god, the pope, or whoever, that's your main focal point. ",

So he's not here to just like, I don't know, to get Christmas presents or something.  He's here to judge the world.  He's the final judgment of Yah.  He's actually Yah's arm of salvation.  And he's also Yah's arm of judgment.  And of course, the people who want to live without that knowledge, even though everybody at one time knew that death was coming and they knew the judgment was coming, they didn't understand that.  So when you start teaching resurrection and the one that's going to judge is this one, then that starts to make an impact.  So, of course, they said we cannot get rid of this truth by blending it.  We can keep it going and we can make money.  And that's a whole nother subject for another time. ",
