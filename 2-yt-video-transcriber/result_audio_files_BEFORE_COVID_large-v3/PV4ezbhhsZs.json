Cory Booker, or sometimes y'all call him Booga, he's quite angry.  He's very, very angry with the royal family.  And he has become totally unhinged.  And we need to address this.  To let Cory Booker know that ADOS is real.  And stop playing with us.  Cut the motherfucking check.  We don't give a fuck about you and your feelings about dealing with Corey Truth.  And you want to gloss over some bullshit.  So, Corey don't like being questioned now.  You know, he's trying to, in his psyche... find a way to, like, rock us back to sleep.  So I want y'all to hear this bullshit that this coon motherfucker called himself offering the royal family. ",

            "text": "Can I tell you why I'm frustrated and disappointed by this reparation conversation?  It's because it's being reduced to just a box to check on a presidential list.  When this is so much more of a serious conversation.  So do I... Do I support legislation that is race conscious about balancing the economic scales?  Not only do I support it, but I have legislation that actually does it.  In fact, I've got the only legislation I think in the entire Congress that Columbia University says would virtually eliminate the racial wealth gap in our country.  It's something called baby bonds.  Which means that every child born in America would get a bond when they're birth, $2,000 placed in it, and during the time, every year of their life, depending on their family's income, they would have more money placed in it.  The lowest income Americans, by the time they reach 18 years old, would have upwards of $50,000, real wealth, a stake in our economy, to invest in going to school or education, starting a business, buying a home.  And so the ideas I'm bringing to the table with very much conscious towards closing racial gaps is there, but let me go further than that, and this is one of the things that frustrates me about this conversation.  Since slavery in this country, our nation's original sin, we have had overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have been oppressing African Americans' economy, but it didn't stop with slavery.  Reconstruction period.  It went even beyond the Reconstruction period into the Jim Crow period.  Many of the best ideas we've had in America that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class, blacks were systematically excluded from the GI Bill to even Social Security is written to try to exclude the professions that African Americans were in.  Even in my lifetime, you had redlining, you had mortgage loan problems.  In fact, my family, to move into New Jersey from Washington,  D.C.,  had to get a white family to pose as them in order to buy the house I grew up in.  And so what I'm saying to you is, and my frustration is, if we don't have A way of addressing head on in this country the persistence of racism, the persistence of white supremacy and implicit racial bias.  And you know it even in the media.  How do we talk about black protesters?  They're thugs.  You see it in our politics.  Willie Horton and welfare queens, these tired tropes that still show up and that allow things to happen like mass incarceration, which has... implicit racial bias in our criminal justice system that hurts blacks.  So I want to make sure that we are dealing with the problem.  That's why I support H.R.  40, which is a bill in the House that would bring together the best minds in America to deal with this issue, not only trying to right economic scales from past harms, but to make sure we are a country that creates a more beloved community where all dignity and humanity is affirmed with every single person in our country.
