            "text": "So I just finished watching the Joe Rogan Alex Jones podcast, or virtually finished it, and I can't get over just how much of a good time I had watching that.  And I mean, judging by the ratings, it looks like almost 4 million other people in one day or so had an amazing time watching it as well.  And I don't even know why.  I don't even know why Alex Jones was just so fun to listen to.  And I mean, I really think it's something to do with Joe himself as well, because normally when it's just him on his show on his own, I mean, I've seen a couple episodes, but I didn't find it very interesting.  And I basically wait for the meme clips to come out and watch them going around, because they're the most interesting bits.  But this whole thing was just amazing.  And it really was Joe at his best as well, his absolute best.  Throughout the whole thing, Joe was just a pleasure to have as the sort of mediating, moderating force on Alex.  And the way that he would indulge what Alex was saying and let him just say what he wanted to say, even if it was nuts, without jumping down his throat and hurting him and trying to attack him.  was really kind and really spoke really well of Joe's character.  And the whole thing was just, it was just like hanging out with your friends, you know, old buddies hanging out and drinking or smoking in this case.  And it was a really, really good time.  And so I'm not surprised that there are some people who are just not very happy about that.  The first one, specifically coming from Forbes magazine.  Why does Forbes need to write an article about Alex Jones and Joe Rogan making peace with a bizarre podcast.  I mean, I honestly held Forbes in higher esteem than that, but I guess now they're a drama outlet.  But the interesting thing about this is it's clear that Joe Rogan, to Joe Rogan, Jones is a genuine friend, a lovable lunatic, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But to justify inviting the controversial conspiracy theorist onto the podcast, Rogan made sure to walk Jones through an apology for that whole Sandy Hook affair, practically holding Jones's hand to keep him from meandering into his interdimensional child molester theories.  That's one of the reasons why Jones is so fun to listen to.  You have no idea what's going to come out of his mouth next.  It could be anything.  Who knows what thing is going to just... I mean, literally, here's a bunch of stuff that is kind of true if looked at in one light, but not accurate if taken as a whole, in composite with other things.  So it's just like, you just don't know what he's going to say.  And it's just amazing.  But yeah, so he goes on, and this is very interesting, like... It was interesting to see how Jones portrays himself as a victim of unfair media coverage, as a man simply examining events from every possible angle.  Somehow his delusions always heavily support alt-right talking points, but that's just a coincidence, surely.  Look, Alex Jones is not alt-right.  He will never be anything like alt-right.  Alex Jones will just get more libertarian.  But this is, like, you can't suggest that Alex Jones had fair media coverage.  The only person in history who's had less fair media coverage than Alex Jones is Donald Trump, who happens to be a friend and has been on Alex Jones' show.  So, you know, it's... Like, he is definitely the victim of unfair media coverage.  I mean, he kept going on about how they said that he thought Santa Claus was fake, and he was like, look, I don't think it was fake.  You know, so it's just like... you can't get any more unfair than that.  Like that's one of the worst things, you know, racism and all this sort of stuff, which obviously no one thinks Alex Jones is a racist.  Only radical leftists who think everyone, the entire world is racist, think that Alex Jones is a racist.  So those allegations are also totally weightless.  You know, they have nothing to them.  But, yeah, it's very interesting how they're just really dismissive and they really are annoyed by the fact that Alex Jones is allowed on.  Listening to Jones' barrage of mouth diarrhea, an imaginative blend of Nazis, aliens, human hybrids, blah, blah, blah, one is left with the impression that we live in a terrifying, chaotic world crushed under the weight of the rich and powerful.  Well, that's kind of true, isn't it?  Like, we do live in a terrifying chaotic world.  And we, I mean, I guess when I say we, surely the leftist socialist types would surely say we are being crushed under the weight of the rich and powerful.  I mean, let's ask Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  How does she feel about that?  She'd be like, well, yeah, of course.  And the world is terrifying and chaotic.  Okay, it's just different interpretations on how it's terrifying and chaotic really, isn't it?  But another one interesting one was on Market Watch.  for some reason, where Alex Jones completely loses it again during Marathon Joe Rogan podcast.  It's like, well, duh, it's Alex Jones.  It's why we're watching.  And then something called Joe, again, you know, Alex Jones on a podcast.  Dextro, never heard of it.  They quashed their beef, though.  Who knows?  Maybe this is some kind of drama website.  I have no idea.  It's a video game website.  And Newsweek, of all places, have actually written about this.  Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, war leads to conspiracy theory, meltdown, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?  Just angry as anything, and they... They really don't like Alex Jones.  They just really don't like him.  Like... It's like they're taking a character seriously.  That's how I feel about it.  It's like they're taking a performance seriously.  Basically, the whole thing is them just trying to defend the Ralph Northam scandal about the abortion up to the point of birth and what would happen afterwards and whatnot and whatnot.  Morally indefensible and I don't really care about Newsweek's opinion on it.  And I really expected to see a vast amount of blue check marks dominating a search for say Joe Rogan and Alex Jones.  but weirdly it's not.  Weirdly, it's just people who absolutely loved it.  The blue check marks are conspicuous in their absence, in fact.  The number of news articles about this is conspicuous in its absence.  There is hardly anything about this, which is really surprising given how it would take five minutes for your average verified check mark to fire off a dozen articles about the things that Alex Jones, just the cavalcade of things that came out of Alex Jones's mouth and Joe Rogan's reactions to them or lack of challenge to a lot of it and things like this.  Not that I think that Joe did anything wrong, obviously.  I had a great time listening to the entire thing, but I know how they're going to see it and they're going to be like, I can't believe.  he let him say blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, uncontested.  So, right, okay.  Where are you?  Why have you all shut up?  What is it about Alex Jones going on?  Joe Rogan that was so successful, that has just effectively just made you, I mean, the only thing I could really find Not bad, but that's hilarious.  Like, the only thing I could really find is this guy, and only 139 likes on his tweet from a massively shared tweet here.  Why would you give this maniac a platform?  And someone's replied, the same reason Twitter gives you a platform, free speech.  Good reply.  It was actually really difficult to find anything, but eventually after just searching for Joe Rogan, I managed to find a few things.  I don't know who Nathan Bernard is, should we check?  Nathan Bernard, a free speech activist at Bernard Media.  Hmm, I find that ironic.  Joe Rogan is currently interviewing Alex Jones about the Master Race and Deep State.  The Master Race?  What, the aliens that control the Greys?  Is that the Master Race?  Why are you making it sound like it's racist?  He's not by human races, is he?  This is why Rogan is considered a gateway to the alt-right.  Hmm.  He platforms their fever dream conspiracies frequently.  Dumbass.  Alex Jones is an alt-right.  Joe Rogan is not a gateway to the alt-right.  They're not even talking about humans.  Like, just enjoy yourself for Christ's sake.  For the love of God.  But David Pakman, Joe Rogan, Alex Jones gish gallops a lot and it's hard to think through each claim.  Would be great to have some counterpoints slash alternative to discuss.  Yeah, I'm sure it would but there's really no point is there?  I mean why on earth would you?  Like just enjoy the experience that it is man.  Stop worrying about it so much.  It's like no one is going to Alex Jones for a Source on any of his claims.  It's just not happening.  It's just fun, right?  but um Joe Rogan is proof of something I learned in high school.  There is no worse creature on earth than a jock who's also into hallucinogens.  Really, Dan, we're just gonna start calling Joe Rogan a dick now, are we?  Even though he doesn't seem to be a dick.  Like, is Joe Rogan a Nazi?  No, he's the reason your son will become a Nazi after being introduced to his guests.  I'm not aware of Joe Rogan ever having one Nazi on his show.  Not fucking one.  Honestly.  Like, she's replying to this.  Why is Alex Jones trending, you wonder?  Because Joe Rogan is amplifying him, trying to make fetch happen again.  The rights alternative influence operation is alive and well.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then, obviously, the data and society thing.  And apparently, this is leading to YouTube... trying to censor the alternative influence network effectively somehow.  And I have no idea why, but I haven't had time to look into that.  I will have to do so another time.  But like, basically that's fucking us.  That's us that they are intent on censoring because they can't stand that Joe Rogan talked to Alex Jones for four hours and had a good time and everyone else had a good time.  and the annoying, bossy, irritating, insufferable, do-gooder, stuck-up kids who suck up to the fucking teacher all day every day are here to ruin everyone's fun.  Don't forget that. ",
