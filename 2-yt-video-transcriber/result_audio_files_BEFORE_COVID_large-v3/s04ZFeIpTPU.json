History explores DNA evidence and the work of historians and scientists to prove that black people were part of the Israelite community in the Bible.  The book claims the world's first man identified as Adam, was a black man from Africa.  My next guest is the book's author.  Dr.  Theron Williams is a pastor in Indianapolis and a Detroit native.  Welcome to American Black Journal. ",

We know that the world's first man, the father of modern humans, was a black man in East Africa.  DNA evidence bears that out.  In fact, the National Geographic Society along with IBM came together and they put together the Genographic Project.  It was headed by Dr.  Spencer Wells and it concluded in 2005.  It was a ten year study and they went worldwide, Dr.  Spencer Wells and his team, collecting DNA evidence from indigenous communities worldwide.  And they wanted to find who is the father of modern humans.  And so we know women have two X chromosomes and men have an X and a Y chromosome.  So they studied the Y chromosome and they traced it back 60,000 years to East Africa and Dr.  Wells and his team concluded that the first modern human was a black man in East Africa whom the Bible identifies as Adam.  So we know that through DNA evidence and then the descendants of Adam obviously would have been black people.  Right, right. ",

That's the wrong question.  The question is since we know that Jesus Christ was not a Scandinavian because he's depicted as Scandinavian, he's depicted as a European in the traditional images of Jesus.

And the priest there told an artist, an African American artist, who was a member of the congregation, to paint a mural behind the altar.  And he said, I want you to try to reflect what you think, why you feel connected to this religion and to this church.  And this artist painted a 30, 35 foot image of black, of Jesus as a black man.  And the controversy that ensued is legend, not just in the neighborhood, but all over the country.  The Washington Post came and wrote a story about it.  But that reaction when someone suggested in the late 1960s, hey, this is who I see when I think about Christ.  I see an African-American.  it elicited this very visceral response.  People are very protective of these other images.  And I think that speaks again to the importance of making sure the truth is understood.  I think it's one thing to say everyone should be able to see themselves in the church and in Christ, but then there's also just the necessity to have fact rule our discussion of those things. ",
