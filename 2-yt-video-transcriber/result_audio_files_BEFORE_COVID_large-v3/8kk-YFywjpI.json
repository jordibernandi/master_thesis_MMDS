And then as you get into the OSS and the more experienced, we start to dive into the the more technical features of it and then exactly how to train people and how to teach them how to go and do that.  We're a very small community and because of that we're allowed to have a smaller classroom setting.  We typically have an initial qualification course about four students at a time and those are the four guys you kind of grow up with in your B2 career.  You'll go through mission qualification with them and then typically you'll end up going through a flight instructor course upgrade with them as well.
