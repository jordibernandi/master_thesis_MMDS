Alan Greenspan, our national economic leader.  has stood up for the last four years and told Americans, borrow against your house.  Getting families to take on more debt will yield more money for these companies, even if the number of foreclosures and defaults keeps climbing.  The way we're financing college educations right now, we are mortgaging our very future in this world.  If we don't get this debt problem straightened out, We were on the risk of turning into a two-tier society, a group that does well financially and then a whole part of America that keeps working and it's always just ",

Today, the stock market is thriving again, but it doesn't reflect the lived experiences of millions of families across this country.  A generation of stagnant wages and rising expenses on health care, housing, child care, student loans has left families in the squeeze.  debts are up.  In fact, credit card debt today matches what it was back in 2008.  Corporations are also deeply in debt and they're spreading systemic risk throughout our economy with packages of loans that look a lot like the subprime mortgage packages that crashed the economy in 2008.  If we don't solve the underlying problems in our economy, the odds are good that we'll face another crash in the next couple of years.  So I'm calling on regulators and Congress to act the way they didn't before the crash of 2008.  So if you think Washington should put the interests of families ahead of the interests of Wall Street, read my plan and join our fight. ",
