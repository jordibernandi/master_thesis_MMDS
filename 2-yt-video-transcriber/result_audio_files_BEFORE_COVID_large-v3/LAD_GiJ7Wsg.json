            "text": "Hello friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor here, and I want to welcome you to our Friday evening Bible Question of the Week, where today we're going to be considering, when will the rapture take place?  That title is a little bit misleading by itself because you might be thinking, I'm going to pick a date for the rapture or the second coming.  And the Bible's clear, no man knows the day or the hour.  What I'm talking about is when is the rapture gonna take place?  in connection with the great tribulation?  that is spoken of several places in the Bible.  First, let me begin by reading to you a verse from Daniel 12, verse one and two.  At that time, this is the end of the book of Daniel, At that time, Michael will stand up, the great prince who stands watch over the sons of your people.  And there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation, even to that time.  And at that time, your people will be delivered, everyone who is found written in the book.  And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, some to shame and everlasting contempt.  Now there are three principle views in relationship to the second coming of Jesus and the tribulation.  And when we say the word rapture, rapture just means to be carried away with power or with force.  And you find that in 1 Thessalonians 4, where it says the dead in Christ will rise, and those of us who are alive and remain will be caught up.  When we are caught up and when we rise, when we meet the Lord in the air, that's the rapture.  All churches believe that when Christ comes at some point, the redeemed go up.  Some believe it's a secret rapture, and I'll get to that in just a minute.  But I want to talk about when will the rapture take place connected to the tribulation.  Some believe that there's a tribulation before the rapture.  Some believe that in the midst of the tribulation, and they think it's a seven-year tribulation, that three and a half years into the tribulation, the rapture will take place.  And some are what they call post-trib.  They believe that following the tribulation is when the rapture takes place.  I and many Protestants are in that group.  Verses like this that we just read here in Daniel chapter 12.  There will be a great time of trouble.  Then your people will be delivered.  Then there is a resurrection.  Many that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake.  You can read in Revelation 7, 14.  It talks about the 144,000.  And John is asking the angel about this great multitude that no one can number.  And it says, These are the ones who have come out of great tribulation.  The Bible tells us there's going to be a great tribulation.  Jesus even refers back to Daniel.  You read in Matthew 24 where Christ talks about the signs of the second coming.  You can look at, oh, in Matthew 24, verse 10, for example.  And then many will be offended and betray one another and hate one another.  Many false prophets will arise and deceive many.  Notice many, many, many.  And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.  But he that endures to the end, the end of what?  The end of this difficult time will be saved.  And he says, prior to his coming, the gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world for a witness.  I believe that's happening even as we speak.  And that's why I think we're living in the last generation.  Then the end will come.  And Christ then says, verse 15, Matthew 24, 15, Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place, it tells us this beast power is going to be standing in the holy place.  You read in 2 Thessalonians, Then that wicked one who exalts himself above all that is called God or worship will sit in the temple of God showing himself that he is God.  This is talking about the beast power claiming the prerogatives that belong to God sitting over the church of God.  The Bible says you are the temple of God.  And then Christ makes a statement spoken by Daniel the prophet, let him who reads understand.  So when you look in Daniel, it talks about this big time of trouble.  Go back to the words of Jesus.  And you can read in verse 20, Matthew 24, 20.  Pray that your flight may not be in the winter or on the Sabbath, for then shall be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world.  Until that time, no, nor ever shall be.  And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved.  But for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened.  So he talks about this great tribulation, just what we read in Daniel chapter 12, a great tribulation.  this tribulation happens before the second coming of christ.  it's the culmination.  now some people say pastor doug the lord loves us too much to let the church go through tribulation.  i said.  really that's not what i read in the bible.  all through the bible god saves his people not from tribulation but he saves them through tribulation.  paul tells us in acts chapter 14 verse 22 strengthening the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith, saying, we must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.  Not from tribulation.  He saves us through tribulation.  Job was not saved from his trials.  He was saved through his trials.  Joseph was saved through the trials of Egypt.  Daniel was saved through the lion's den.  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were saved through the fiery furnace.  God went through the furnace with them.  God sent his angel to be with Daniel in the lion's den.  Psalm 91 says he'll give his angels charge over you.  You'll see a thousand fall at your right hand, ten thousand at your side, but it will not come nigh unto you.  But you're there seeing it.  But God protects you.  God protected Rahab when the walls of Jericho fell around her.  God protected Noah through the storm.  He wasn't saved from the storm.  He was saved through the storm.  The Great Tribulation is the seven last plagues that you find in Revelation 15 and 16.  Now here's my question.  The seven last plagues are very similar to the ten plagues that Israel went through in Egypt.  Did God save Israel from the ten plagues or did he save Israel in Egypt through the plagues?  They were in Egypt when the plagues fell but he protected them through the seven last of the ten plagues.  Isn't that interesting?  Seven plagues in Revelation.  and God protected the Israelites through the last seven of the 10 plagues that fell on Egypt.  So we'll be in the world.  He'll protect us through these tribulations.  And you can read in Matthew 24, verse 13, again, he that endures, endures what?  To the end, he'll be saved.  Paul says in Romans 5, verse 3, not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance.  2 Timothy 3.12, yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.  Ephesians 5.27, that he might present her to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemishes.  So God's coming for a church that has no spot or wrinkles.  How do you get out the spots when you do laundry?  Hot water, the wrinkles, a hot iron.  It's gonna be fiery trials.  Peter says, do not be amazed at the fiery trials that will try your faith as though some strange thing has happened.  And yet there are millions of loving Christians.  I believe that there are a lot of saved people out there that misunderstand when the rapture is gonna happen in relation to the tribulation.  And because they think they're gonna get raptured away before the tribulation, They're not prepared, and they are going to be amazed at the fiery trials that are going to come.  Also, people are expecting Jesus to just rapture away the saints.  They're being set up for a false Christ to impersonate Jesus.  And so this is very dangerous to not understand this subject.  I think a lot of folks are going to be discouraged near the end.  The Bible doesn't say anything about the tribulation being seven years.  You do not find the phrase seven-year tribulation in the Bible.  People draw that conclusion because they take the last week of Daniel chapter 9, they tear it off the prophecy, and they sort of have it float in some indetermined place at the end of time.  That prophecy is all one complete, concise, contiguous prophecy, Daniel 9, the 490-year prophecy.  Or they take the seven days that Noah and his family were on the ark before the flood came, and they turn that into seven years and say that's the seven years of tribulations.  really don't have anything that teaches seven years of tribulation.  you don't find that phrase in the bible.  it's an assumption that's made.  will there be a big time of trouble in the end?  yes how long will it be?  we don't know for sure.  i kind of think it's going to be within a year.  part of the reason for that is you can read in revelation chapter 18 verse 8. therefore her plagues will come in one day.  now a day in prophecy is a year.  that means all.  within a year's time the plagues will fall.  How long did it take for the plagues to fall on Egypt?  You read that and they come back to back in quick succession.  It's like a blitzkrieg that happens.  The plagues that fell on Job, how long did that take?  It was a matter of weeks, just one right after the other.  And I think in the last days, those seven last plagues, if they lasted very long, there'd be no life on earth.  As Jesus said, no flesh would be saved.  Oceans blood.  All the rivers are blood.  Men are being scorched with great heat.  Noisome grievous sore.  Kingdom of the beast is plunged into darkness.  And the great hailstones.  You look at the plagues and that's not going to be going on for years.  And so I think it's very important to understand this subject to be ready for what's coming.  Now, will the rapture be a secret?  I'll just close with this.  We all agree the Lord's coming.  We'll be caught up.  I believe the coming is the end of the tribulation and that it is not a secret.  The Bible says that he's coming with a shout.  The Lord will send with a shout, with a trumpet.  It tells us he's coming like a lion.  He will roar.  There'll be a mighty earthquake such as there never has been.  There's a resurrection.  It's going to be like lightning that shines from the east to the west.  The scriptures tell us that the second coming, every eye is going to see it.  Some are thinking, but Pastor Doug, doesn't it say that the second coming is going to be like a thief?  Yeah, let's read that.  He's coming like a thief, but that doesn't mean it's quiet.  It doesn't mean it's a secret.  You look in 2 Peter 3, verse 10.  But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night.  Some pastors stop right there.  Keep reading a little bit.  It'll come as a thief in the night in which the heavens pass away with a great noise.  Not a secret.  The elements melt with fervent heat.  Both the earth and the works that are in it are burned up.  Everything is burned up.  Everything is going to melt.  You read on here.  And it says... looking for and hastening, this is verse 12, the coming of the day of God because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat.  So does it look like life goes on for seven more years after we are caught up and when the Lord returns like a thief?  When Jesus comes like a thief, there's nobody living on this planet because the elements melt with fervent heat.  I know there's much more I could say on this subject, but I probably said too much already for these little segments.  But we do have a special offer.  It covers this, talks about the tribulation and the secret rapture.  It's a book I wrote called Anything But Secret.  And we'll send you a free copy.
