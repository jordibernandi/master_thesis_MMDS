            "text": "Hey family, I lost you on that first video.  This is part two of Shark's Cove.  As I was saying, right there is where you'll find the lobsters.  Over there is that cave and it's just a beautiful place to go in and cool off and you come back out.  You can even see a lady sitting on a lounge chair in the water just outside of the cave right there.  But anyways... Many, many years ago, me and five other divers, we went and traversed all the way to the top up there.  It was heavy.  You know, it's like about anywhere from 60 to 80 pounds of scuba diving equipment that we had on.  And it was hot because we had our rubber suits on.  But we went into a lava tube.  The lava tube goes straight down and then shoots out.  straight down and then shoots out.  It's 60 feet.  Actually, the month before, three Navy men, excuse me, three Marines died attempting it.  What happens is that we jump in one at a time.  As the ocean comes in, it pushes the water up that L-shaped lava tube up to the top.  And you can see it.  Then all of a sudden, the ebb and flow, right, the ebb and flow of the tide, it flushes.  Now it goes out.  And you can see it sucking down.  And like, wow, that's quite a sight.  It's a hole sucking you down with the water and everything.  You jump in.  And one at a time, you know, you go down, you release your BC pressure, and you hit the bottom of this hole.  You gotta hold on tight.  The walls are all jagged and pretty hard, so that's why we have our rubber suits and gloves on.  One at a time, we come down, and we're down at the bottom of this L shape.  Our dive master gave us all sequence.  I was number three, and when it was my turn, he pointed at me.  I turn, I go into the tube, I hold onto it, I go once, Nothing.  I grab it one more time.  I push out.  It is at that time that the equilibrium between the water pressure on the surface and the water pressure in the ocean got me.  It just shot me out like a torpedo.  And I'm out there.  See where the red cap is at where those diapers are at?  That's where it shot us out to.  And out there are arches.  Arches.  And what I mean by arches is, you see that cave that I told you about?  Well, the cave remains, but everything else erodes.  And all you have is this art.  They look like... like mcdonald arches or the uh missouri.  what is that st louis?  uh the arch of st louis that that's what hundreds of them.  and i'm down there and i'm just swimming away.  i'm banking to the right going underneath an arch coming back up.  yep i was uh i was flipper man i had a good time and then the dive master you know takes his knife and he clangs on his tank.  So we all gathered by him because he wanted to show us something and he pointed in back of him the wall, the back of that wall right there, that back wall.  And all of a sudden he says, you know, watch.  And we all had our sequence number and he tells us to go.  So he takes one, two, all of a sudden his body disappears into the wall.  A surface.  And we're looking like, what the heck?  But the more bubbles that we create, it's like a mirror.  So all we can see is our own reflection.  So when it was my turn, here goes the second one.  But the first one, the second one, it was my turn.  I go up there.  I'm like, I stick my hand in like, there's nothing but air.  I'm 60 feet under the ocean.  How is this possible?  So I go up and I'm underneath a cave.  I'm in a cave 60 feet under the ocean.  And I'm breathing.  I take the mask off and I'm... I can taste like bacteria, the primordial air, you know, Jurassic Park air is what it was.  And I could actually see a glow because there were the zoanthians that were glowing off of the ceiling of that cave that we were in.  It was about the size of an amphitheater.  Yeah.  And we all take off our gear.  We sit there and we just rest.  And he says, shh, listen.  And we could actually hear.  You know, like little drops in the background.  Our downtime was cut, you know, in half.  We had to suit back up, get out.  Each one of us went back into the water and then back up to the surface.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm 63 years old.  I wouldn't do that now.  Oh, they just jumped out.  Watch him.  He's going to jump off too.  Come on, guy.  Get on up there.  Come on.  There you go.  Now, don't be afraid.  One, two, three.  Oh, not there.  Oh, no.  I think he hit the rocks.  Oh, well, he'll learn.  Oh, look at it.  I got to go help him.  He's drowning.  Hey, let's take him down really quick right there, baby, and then we're done with this recording, okay?  Come on down, family.  I'd like to show you a little bit closer down to the ocean.  Pretty cool.  Pretty dangerous too.  Let me have the camera, honey.  You stay back here.  These fishes could actually break off.  And if they do, you would end up going into the ocean just like it broke off right here.  Right.  Oh, shit.  There you go, family.  This is one of the fishes that broke off and people that were standing there paid the price.  But anyways, this is Shark Cove.  Just thought I'd bring you out here.  Let's see if I can get a little closer.  it's about 100 feet deep right there right in that spot right there.  pretty cool.  anyways you don't want to go down there.  i've been down there in fact.  look this is why i went down there.  let me see if i can zoom in on it because i like these urchins hang in there with me.  ah I'm trying my best, but it's messing up.  I apologize.  There you go.  I zoomed in.  Now, let me see if I can find these purple guys.  Right there.  I believe there.  There.  Right.  I can't.  Anyways, I believe you can see them right there.  Right about there.  Those are limpets.  And they're really good.  They're related.  They're part of the family of the urchin.  Now watch this crab right there.  You see him?  It's a red crab.  And unfortunately, that red crab... If I was that hungry, he'd be mine.  This red crab over here, somebody ate him up.  Sorry about that.  Anyways, this is Shark's Cove, and I just wanted to bring you out here.  And Jan and I are about to get into those tide pools over there.  Speaking of Jan, where's my Tinkerbell?  Where's my Tinkerbell?  There she is!  Take the glass off and say hi, babe.  Anyways, here I give this back so we can say goodbye.  I really thank you for coming to Frank 26 YouTube channel.

And now I'm going to see if we can have another migration from the form to the chat room was one migration.  Now from the chat room to here, you see on premium, there's a charge to pay the overhead, but here on YouTube, it's no charge.  It'd be only by our efforts.  Whether we'd be rewarded or not.  I love you.  Because that's what I was taught to do.  Bye-bye.  Did we turn it off?  Papyrus.  The Egyptians used to use this to make paper out of.  The Hawaiians used it to make fabric out of it.  I better shut up, I talk too much. ",
