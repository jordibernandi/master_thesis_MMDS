This is what building power looks like.  This is what changing the country looks like.  It's when we choose to show up and occupy the room and talk about the things that matter most, talking about our future.  You know, Reverend, you bring up a funny anecdote, and I'm proud to be a bartender.  Ain't nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy.  There is nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors will eat.  There is nothing wrong with driving the buses that take your family to work.  There is nothing wrong with being a working person in the United States of America, and there is everything dignified about it. ",
