            "text": "My video for January the 31st, 2020 is video number 3,362.  The title is, What Does It Mean?  Who is Sorka Fall?  For several years, I have been reading reports by Sorka Fall thinking she was a Russian lady.  I was wrong.  Quote, Sister Maria Theresa is the 73rd Sorka Fall of the Sorka Fall Order, of the Sorka Fall Order.  Elected as Mother Superior 3 February 2007, born in Dublin, Ireland, the 73rd Sorka Fall joined the Order in March 1973 and holds various degrees with both European and United States universities.  Sarkaphal has traveled and lectured extensively throughout the world, with her primary focus being the systematic structure of languages, serving as a link between thought and sound, as developed by Ferdinand de Saussure.  Sorka Fall has further expanded her own research on linguistic ordering with knowledge gained while a visiting researcher with Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist Pezhor Gordjev on the esoteric structure of DNA and its uses in explaining physic phenomena.  The order of Sarkaphal was established in 588 before Christian era in Tara County, Meath, Ireland, and claim as their founder, the oldest daughter of King Zedegiah, Tamar Tefi.  The name Sarkaphal comes from the ancient Gaelic branch of the, of the, Gallic language, languages of Ireland, and has the meaning of Sorka, she who brings light, fall, the dark and barren places.  The Order of Sarkafal comprises 18 monasteries in Ireland, Russia, Egypt, Lebanon, and the United States, end quote.  i never knew that.  i mean that came as a surprise and i'm thankful to my friend who sent me that.  uh that link.  to get the story behind the story as paul harvey used to say i was unaware.  i mean i've always thought that sarkapal was a russian and of course there is a connection to russia but I didn't realize the Irish connection.  And I, of course, read that to my friend who was born in Ireland, who lives here in the apartment complex where I live.  Anyway, I want to update you a little bit on what happened yesterday.  I did get my car back after two days of struggles.  And ironically, my daughter called me and needed a ride because she had a flat tire and was having trouble picking up her daughters, my granddaughters.  And anyway, when I get my car back, they didn't even do the first thing that was on the list.  flushing the cooling system and refilling it.  They didn't do that.  And I didn't notice that till I got the car back home here and took the cap off the radiator and realized, hey, it's just like it was.  I wanted that cleaned out.  Anyway, folks, Sorka Fall, as I said, is someone that I've been getting reports by.  I don't know how long.  It's been a number of years.  that I've been getting these reports and completely unaware of the expansiveness of what the order of Sarkaphal is.  I didn't realize.  I mean, I thought it was one individual.  No, she's the 73rd Sarkaphal.  And it has the connection, as I said, to Ireland.  Again, I have my Irish right now.  I'm sorry I butchered those names.  I am really bad at pronouncing some of the Russian names and stuff like that, as well as other languages too.  English is my limitation.  I mean, I understand English and I can speak it fairly well, but when it comes to pronunciation of some foreign words, I am virtually clueless.  I bring this out because it shows how easily we can project our thoughts and ideas onto something, and there's much more meaning behind it than what we see at first glance.  Like I said, I've been reading these reports, getting them sent to me in Publishers Clearinghouse, for a long time and didn't realize this, so I'm grateful.  And when somebody can send me information that expands my thinking and allows me to gain another perspective on what it is that I'm coming across, I can appreciate that.  Now, some people send me things that quite frankly, I cannot relate to.  Somebody sent me a video recently of some guy reading a book and not reading it even very well, as if the information he was trying to give, if I wanted to read the book, send me the link to the book.  And And let me go from there.  I don't need to watch a video with somebody reading something to me.  Now, of course, I got criticized recently for reading my videos.  Well, all I read is the blurb.  And that's why a minute and a half, two minutes of a 10 minute video, two minutes is probably tops of the length of the blurb.  It fits on a little piece of a screen that's to the side of the.  what I can see being recorded now that when when I make the video that it's it expands the width of the of the image but I'm still looking at a little teeny corner so that the whole blurb fits on that one little section with all of the keywords and stuff like that for when I upload the video.  And yes, I had a problem yesterday with my video on Facebook just simply disappeared.  And I tried a couple more times to put it back up.  Initially, it went up.  But then it seemed to disappear from my main Facebook page.  And I tried a couple more times to put it back up and it kept disappearing.  And so finally, I made a comment about it disappearing.  And posted the link to it in that thing.  and then uh that showed up.  and then i went back again and i thought i'd try again because it showed up and sure enough this time it went up again.  so i don't know what's going on with facebook i don't know what's going on with the united states i don't know what's going on in the world.  i mean things that i thought i knew.  Like, who's Thorka Falls?  She's not a Russian lady at all.  She's connected to Ireland.  I think I know things, but I don't wait to hear or I don't learn the rest of the story.  And it's very, very important for us to look at and become aware of more and more.  And when that can be done in a non-argumentative fashion, with an open mind of wanting to explore and look at perspectives.  Where's that person coming from?  Again, I emphasize that that is how wisdom is developed.  It's not developed by thinking you have all the answers.  And those people that tell me, Ron, you're wrong.  They're only sharing or only coming from a place of their own viewpoint.  And I understand that.  So I'm not going to be too critical of it because I've been there myself.  Anyway, thank you for listening about Sarka Fall.  Namaste. ",
