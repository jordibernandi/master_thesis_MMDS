            "text": "Here's some fresh piping hot news.  Sopping, piping hot news being slopped into your ears.  Roy Disney, it's true.  He at least one time and had a son also named Roy Disney.  And that guy, at least four times and had a daughter named Abigail Disney, who recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post calling out the Disney company for also its employees by paying its executives 1,424 times the median pay of a Disney worker.  As pointed out in the article, this gap is far bigger than in the 70s and 80s, when a CEO only made 30 times the median worker pay.  And it's even larger than the current ratio of 271 to 1, meaning that the current Disney CEO, Robert Iger, whose salary is at 65 million dollars, is his workers seven times more than other CEOs, who are also their workers.  Boy, this video's gonna be immediately demonetized, isn't it?  Now, in their defense, the company that currently owns seven of the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time gave a retort, saying that while they are a forever-expanding serpent gradually enveloping the planet for the purposes of ultimate financial domination, they do pay their employees a little bit above minimum wage.  So... Problem solved.  I apologize for even bringing it up, honestly.  Hey, I got a question.  Why aren't we more worried about Disney right now?  You probably heard that they just purchased Fox, and even more recently, have taken full control of Hulu, meaning that along with owning all of Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, and all those indie Miramax films, which, by the way, they absolutely abused their control over and have refused films over moral stances, along with owning all of that, They now own The Simpsons, Aliens, The Handmaid's Tale, Independence Day, Die Hard, Home Alone, Predator, Avatar, The X-Files, Atlanta, Futurama, Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Planet of the Apes, American Dad, and of course, Quills.  Also, like hundreds of more shows and movies you probably love, they own all of that.  By one estimate, it's 35% of the market share, which in context is over twice as much as the second biggest studio, Warner Brothers, aka the guys who gave Superman clinical depression.  And that's why I get it.  While many other studios are screwing up, we're all understandably excited about potentially seeing a good version of the Fantastic Four, or Wolverine fighting the Hulk, or the cast of Garden State getting hunted by the Predator.  But we can't be so blinded by fandom to not examine the consequences of Disney's expanding reach, especially when the more you dig into this Fox merger and the company as a whole, the worse the future of entertainment looks.  So let's do exactly that!  Let's look at how this merger came to be and who benefited from it.  Spoilers, it wasn't the workers.  Instead, it was this guy, Rupert Murdoch, seen here with America's most racist hat salesman, who made $8.7 billion off of the Fox sale to Disney.  If you're not aware, ol' Roop is best known for having a direct line to the POTUS, often working Fox News in tandem with his policies.  When the sale was announced, our totally-for-the-people president publicly praised the merger, saying it would be a great thing for jobs.  Great, of course, being an adjective he ironically uses to mean terrible and opposite of good, as evidenced by all the Disney merger layoffs, and also every time he's ever used the word great.  Oh, and along with being very wrong about the prospects of the merger, the president also called Murdoch to get his assurance that he wasn't selling Fox News, which is, it's a weird thing for a president to be interested in.  Also weird, when a similar merger was happening between AT&T and Time Warner, then candidate Trump did the opposite of praising it.  AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN.  A deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.  Oh, that... That's weird, how he specifically called out CNN in his clearly honest concern about giving too much power to too few people.  What a weird thing for a person who would later praise a giant Fox-Disney merger to do.  Have I mentioned how weird this all is?  Well, if you're wondering, Trump's DOJ did in fact try to block the AT&T merger, taking nearly two years of legal squabbling before the deal was finally approved by the courts.  What makes this significant is that this deal was something called a vertical merger, which is a merger between two companies that aren't directly competing with each other.  This kind of merger hasn't been contended by the DOJ since the Carter administration.  Meanwhile, the Disney-Fox merger is a horizontal merger, because it's two companies making the exact same product.  This is something the FTC has identified as the greatest antitrust concern when dealing with these cases.  There's that word great again.  And yet, despite the Disney-Fox merger technically being a way bigger deal, it only took six months for the DOJ to approve.  So, putting aside whether or not you think these giant mergers are even good in the first place, It's pretty weird that the DOJ was so inconsistent when it came to these two cases.  In fact, it's baffled many people smarter than me who have pointed out that the DOJs had concerns over AT&T and Time Warner that should have applied to the Disney-Fox merger, but for some reason, didn't.  But hey, maybe it was one of them magic Disney miracles oriented toward heartless business decisions, like how all those mice turned into horses for cheap carriage labor.  At this point, you might be thinking, well, hey, this is all the Department of Justice and not Trump.  I'm sure they have their own complicated legal reasons, you beautiful swole-dicked news dude.  Well, first of all, thanks for that.  I really needed a boost today.  But also, let me introduce you to Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.  After the New York Times called out the DOJ for making a seemingly politically driven decision, Delrahim wrote a rebuttal in the Washington Times, a news organization known for its well-researched, nonpartisan integrity.  It's an interesting counterpoint in that it doesn't explain in any detail why the two mergers were treated differently.  Instead, saying broadly that no two mergers are the same and that Disney was apparently more cooperative.  That's as far as the explanation goes.  But don't worry because this isn't the only op-ed written by Megan Delrahim that explains this merger.  There's also this one written by him in 2016 calling for America to vote for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.  So yeah, totally not political, says the man who received a McCann antitrust great again hat when first arriving at the DOJ.  America is doing just fine, you guys.  but let's say, for fun, that you don't care about who is making what as long as these mergers are creating jobs and or making more content available for us, the consumer.  Well, that wasn't the case with AT&T Time Warner, which not only created massive layoffs, but actually raised its subscription prices to pay for the acquisition.  The same thing has happened over at Disney, who both fired thousands of staff and cut Fox's film slate in half.  So if you actually like capitalism and wanted to create jobs, it sure would be weird to support a change that results in fewer jobs and fewer products.  Also, and this is pretty obvious, but giving all this power to one company is a bad thing to do?  Especially when it's Disney, a corporation that has famously abused its power in the past.  When the LA Times wrote a piece criticizing their business operations in California, Disney banned them from early screenings of their films.  They've habitually shut out small theater chains due to their extreme demands for playing their films, often asking for a much larger portion of ticket sales and guaranteed four weeks of screen time in the largest auditoriums.  and as they grow larger, their extortions and demands will be harder and harder to boycott.  They've changed laws to keep Mickey out of public domain, and once convinced Florida to let them build a nuclear power plant.  They are bullies.  But it's okay, because The Simpsons made fun of how they are corporate overlords.  It's fine, because we're getting a bunch of new Star Wars and Marvel films.  Isn't that fantastic, you guys?  Like, we all know that Disney is evil, but we just kinda joke about it and move on.  We all go see the movies because how can we not?  And they know this and don't even need to think about how well a franchise is doing, opting to just flat out tell us that they're shoving out an endless parade of Avatar and Star Wars films until the sun explodes.  Films that, even as I say this, I will probably go see, because life is crushing without occasionally watching a make-believe story projected in a big fancy room.  Like, holy crap, they are remaking The Lion King shot for shot, not paying the original writers, and will probably make a billion dollars doing it.  And this is just one aspect of this company.  There's so much more to talk about the moment we factor in streaming and the internet.  Specifically, what's going to happen once Disney rolls out Disney+, and begins pulling their content from other services, and what other companies will have to do to compete with their giant library of films and TV shows.  Companies that, unlike Disney, own internet service providers, the things that were just given way more power via their appeal of net neutrality.  This could gradually create a Uh, uh, cluster , where certain companies are given better access than others, and the entertainment we love will just continue to splinter off into smaller services.  NBC, for example, is starting its own streaming service, giving them little reason to keep their shows on the now Disney-owned Hulu.  and since NBC has merged with Comcast, they could give that new service a preferential treatment, bundling it with cable subscriptions.  There's nothing stopping AT&T Time Warner from doing the same for HBO.  Meanwhile, Netflix is looking into buying theaters for some reason I just don't have the energy to get into.  It's a sloppy mess.  But just to be clear, streaming is absolutely the future of entertainment and is objectively a great thing.  The real meaning of the word great, there's no denying that.  Being able to watch theatrical style content while not wearing pants is a wonderful thing we no longer have to be arrested for doing.  But we're at a point where the government hasn't really done anything to regulate the transition and these giant companies are largely left to do whatever they want.  And what makes it especially scary is that the huge companies creating the content are the same ones in charge of our access to the content.  It's a system where essentially the movie theater is also creating the entertainment and is going to shut out more unique and independent films and limit access for consumers.  The reason I know this is because it was absolutely what happened back when film studios were allowed to own their own cinemas.  This was changed back in the 40s when the Supreme Court forced major movie companies to divest themselves of their theater chains.  Before that point, the studios either owned large chains or strong-armed indie theaters into contracts requiring them to show a given number of films.  This created a system where only seven studios were able to successfully make films while smaller companies constantly struggled to compete.  And so indie studios formed the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers and helped push the government to pursue it as an antitrust case.  Ironically, one of the founders of the group was Walt Disney himself, a man who, as you might remember, had a brother who at least one time.  Now, 70 years later, and already there are several smaller streaming companies that have been forced to shut down because they can't compete with Netflix and Amazon.  And while those sites and streaming in general used to be great for indie filmmakers, the shift to original content has made these companies disinterested in simply acting as distribution.  Netflix and Amazon, for example, have stopped licensing indie movies and are now either making their own films or trying to buy the rights to a select few.  What should be great for the indie market has been ruined because no one wants to simply host other people's films anymore.  These digital theaters are too busy making movies to properly act like a theater.  Like, imagine you're going out to eat.  and your waiter opened their own Build-A-Burger stand right inside of the restaurant.  And then all the other waiters decided to open their own competing stands.  And then there was this one big rat-looking waiter who had hamburgers so delicious that everyone had to copy the exact recipe.  Meanwhile, all you wanted was a grilled cheese.  Kinda like that, except there are no other restaurants to choose from, and in this universe, eating food is constantly joked as being a ruse to bone.  It's actually the subject of a dystopian erotic culinary show that I'm currently shopping around.  Give me a call.  My number is not in the description.  I will not give you my phone number.  But anyway, along with screwing indie filmmakers, this new system has completely screwed over industry workers who aren't famous or already rich.  One thing people don't tend to realize about with streaming is that because of the lack of residuals and shorter seasons aimed at binge-watching, mid-level crew and actors are now forced to make much less money while constantly searching for a new job.  people who would normally make thousands of dollars for network gigs, are now having to settle for a few hundred dollars for a Netflix show.  Because while there's a lot more content going around, companies are cutting corners in order to draw in audiences with big partnership announcements with specific talent, meaning that the only people really benefiting are the showrunners and major producers and big-name actors and directors.  The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.  We're familiar.  Tale as old as time.  It's an extremely unstable system that no one is regulating.  The only foreseeable hope is that the DOJ has recently announced that it's going to review those original antitrust laws to account for streaming.  But that would... That was a year ago, and if you remember, it's an organization run by the totally not political Mr.  Makan Antitrust Great Delrahim.  So until the government steps in, we're going to see our movies and TV continue to cluster together into these large, unchallenging brands.  You might not notice it right away, because the shift will be gradual and wrapped up in fandom for the larger blockbusters.  Have you seen what the Disney Plus menu is going to look like?  Instead of genres, we're getting broad franchises listed as channels.  After being bought by AT&T, HBO's CEO resigned after the company announced that it's going to pursue bigger and broader content to compete with Netflix and Disney.  In other words, they are shifting to quantity over quality, something Netflix has already begun to do with just some of the worst sci-fi imaginable.  You like more niche and character-driven shows like Deadwood and True Detective?  Well, get ready to watch that stuff slowly fade away as HBO tries to hook a larger audience.  Meanwhile, Apple is also starting a streaming service, but is limiting their content to very specific family-friendly shows and films in order to cast a wide net.  And that's why we should really be more concerned about Disney and the fact that they are growing disturbingly large while everyone just excitedly lets it happen.  Because eventually, we might wanna watch stuff that isn't giant event movies and super hype TV shows, but if we aren't careful, could find ourselves living in a world where story diversity is no longer commercially available.  Disney is soon going to take over streaming like it's taking over everything, and all of these services will be marching to the beat of their drum.  Except for YouTube, which is scaling back its original content so as to not compete with Netflix and Amazon, because they are COWARDS!  Or... or... or... because they have a clear vision of what they do, which is... Like, give Nazis a platform?  Honest, good intentioned Nazis.  Please don't demonetize this!  Hey, everybody.
