Linda Sarsour, co-founder of the Women's March, finds herself at the center of both.  You can count on me, your Palestinian Muslim sister, to keep my head held high because I am not afraid.  In 2017, Sarsour was catapulted into the limelight as one of the leaders of the Women's March.  She is a controversial figure, beloved by some and hated by others.  We all agree that Linda Sarsour is a Sharia-loving, terrorist-embracing, Jew-hating, ticking time bomb of progressive horror.  In the last year, Sarsour has taken a step back from the Women's March and is refocusing her activism on the 2020 presidential race.  She wants Trump out.  This administration has a white nationalist supremacist agenda.  We are living under fascism.  This is fascism.  And Bernie Sanders in. ",

You are known for being one of the co-founders of the Women's March, mobilizing millions of American women and women around the world.  But beyond that, you actually have done a lot of things, and I want to read some of them.  You have helped to partly dismantle the NYPD program that spies on Muslims.  You have worked with City Hall to close public schools on two Muslim holidays.  You are the former executive director of the Arab American Association of New York.  You co-founded a Muslim online organization platform, and you fought for higher wages for McDonald workers.  I want to go back to the essential question, which is, what was the point that triggered your activism? ",
