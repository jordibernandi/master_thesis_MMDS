Oh no, that's number two.  Number one, he loves God.  Number one, he loves God.  That's everything.  Number two, you are so hard.  Number three, he has such a good heart.  That's so nice.  Wow.

Like, it's not shallow.  So you see that this is something really serious, not just those shallow, like, transient qualities in the person.  And I would admire the fact that she's very supportive and she's willing to learn and grow and also, that's really so cool.  Like, I love these people.  I've spent time with them here in Nigeria and I can attest to all that they are saying.  Everything they've said about each other is true.  Like, There's no faking it here.  Everything is so real.

I understand.  I've been in this space before, like, long-distance relationships.  They are not really easy.  And that's why I admire them so much.  Like, they're not in the same country, but there's so much going on here, and it's so pure and so real.  So, like, what Rudy has said seems, like, resonates with my own experience, like, If there was anything that would change, Trudy said she would like to change the distance.  I feel like everything happens for a reason.  At the same time, the distance is working for our own good.  Even if I must change, everything happens for a reason.  What about you, Maya? ",
