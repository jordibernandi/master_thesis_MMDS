It isn't just built like television, it looks, feels, and sounds like television, right down to the fabrication of conflict in a build-up to where commercial breaks would go.  This forms an interesting contrast between Vsauce and another similar channel, Vsauce.  Vsauce is a popular educational YouTube channel helmed by Michael Stevens.  In a given video Michael will pop up and for about ten minutes take the viewer on a pinball exploration of a scientific subject typically in the realm of psychology with a particular focus on the science of perception, but also a fascination with math and astronomy.  A critic of Vsauce might describe the format of a Vsauce video as unfocused, with each video taking its subject matter less as a thesis and more as an excuse to ramble for several minutes about vaguely related subjects.  A proponent of Vsauce, on the other hand, might describe the format of a Vsauce video as poetic, with each video taking its subject matter less as a thesis and more as a theme, an opportunity to create a free-form association between ideas that share a commonality of language or an overlap of consequences.  The video What Is the Speed of Dark is less about the physics of photons and more about a variety of subjects that all share an intersection in the idea communicated in the word dark.  This unstructured science poetry forms an interesting contrast between Vsauce and another similar channel, Vsauce.  Vsauce is a popular variety YouTube channel helmed by Michael Stevens.  In a given video, Michael will compile a rapid-fire freeform presentation assembled around a common seed idea, like funny or interesting images or bizarre consumer products, a format riddled with innuendo, dick jokes, and cleavage.  The average Vsauce video will skip across a couple dozen examples in only a few minutes, each beat connected to the next by pun or some other free association word game.  with a particular love for juvenile humor, curious facts, and optical illusions.

            "text": "This is in part the fascinating semantic language of YouTube.  The word channel for YouTube is borrowed from television where a channel is synonymous with a station and is largely station airy.  A television station is a fixed point, a portal through which the viewer watches a flow of content as it moves past.  A YouTube channel, on the other hand, is less like this channel and more like this channel.  The common metaphor here is flow.  A channel is a means of transport, a space that things pass through.  But a YouTube channel isn't a fixed point, a bench on which you watch the boats as they sail past.  It's the whole thing.  You can go to a YouTube channel and walk along the metaphorical bank by scrolling all the way down.  You can travel from here to here.  Ludwig Wittgenstein argued that language was representational, that there is a single factual reality and it is the job of language to describe these facts.  Language, thus, is like taking a picture, and the better a language, the stronger its underlying logic, the clearer the picture.  This brings up an interesting contrast between the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein.  Wittgenstein argued that the picture theory of language was entirely wrong, that words are not facts, are not fixed points in space, but rather words are how you use them.  In other words, use dictates meaning.  We have told the story backwards, and now let us tell it forwards.  Vsauce launched in 2010 was a gaming channel that featured a broad swath of video game-based dick jokes and boob thumbnails that morphed into a variety channel compiling interesting videos, images, and curiosities with a particular focus on dick jokes and boob thumbnails.  As more and more videos were produced, the curiosities floated to the top until Vsauce posted its first self-contained educational video in July 2011 on the nature of explosions. ",

            "text": "The rapid-fire delivery remained, but the innuendo gradually took a backseat to questions like why the Earth has a moon and the existentialism of atomic physics.  In September 2012, the last of the variety shows was posted with Loot Episode 27, Carrot Sharpener.  It is most likely this phase here that most people think of when they say Vsauce.  This is when they attracted most of their 14 million subscribers.  This is when Bill Nye made a guest appearance.  Flash forward to January 2017, Vsauce announced the new premium show Mind Field, available only to YouTube Red subscribers.  While a few monologue-driven videos have been released since then, the last of them, Which Way is  Down?,  was posted in November 2017.  As we stand now, in February 2019, here on the Bank of Vsauce channel, it looks like Mind Field is Vsauce.  But that's not the all of it, because that is simply from now.  There is conceivably a future snapshot of Vsauce where Mind Field is itself just a stratum, a phase the channel went through, in the same way the Vsauce people conceptualize the freeform.  Psi poetry is a stratum between Mind Field and the hodgepodge of nonsense and dongs that preceded it, the same as L\u00fct and Image are a stratum between existential psychology and painfully dated jokes about Snooki having sexually transmitted infections.  There is no real, essential, elemental Vsauce because they are all Vsauce.  And as always, thanks for watching. ",
