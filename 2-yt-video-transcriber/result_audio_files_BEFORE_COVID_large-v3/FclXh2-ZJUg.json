            "text": "Trump said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and get away with it.  No, I don't think so.  He did say that.  No, he didn't.  It's on tape.  No, I don't believe it.  I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?  No, I don't believe it.  No, that's fake.  I swear to God, you can watch it.  Fake news, fake news, fake news, fake news.  He said I grab women by the pussy.  You're a liar.  He said it on tape.  It's not against her will.  People grab other people once in a while.  Haven't you?  Well, maybe you haven't had a woman.  Can I just ask you a question, sir?  My woman came to me the other night.  She sat on the couch next to me.  Lucky woman.  She said, hey, Benjamin, what are you doing over there?  Come grab my pussy.  Lock her up.  Lock her up.  Lock her up.  My ears burn.  Trump's a billionaire.  Yes, and so is Joe Biden.  No.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Trump went bankrupt four times.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  And that's business.  Lowest employment ever on record for blacks.  Lowest employment ever on record for women.  Look at this dude.  I don't think there was any racism until Obama got elected.  And if you're black... And you haven't been successful in the last 50 years.  It's your own fault.  Who do I support?  I support Bernie Sanders.  Bernie Sanders, who's a Cherokee Indian who had us in slavery, of course.  Bernie Sanders is a Cherokee Indian?  He is, he says he is, his wife is, but that ain't the point.  What are you talking about?  The point I'm making is... No, you're talking about Elizabeth Warren.  No, Bernie Sanders, I'm talking about him, sir.  You just don't know who he is.  You're talking about Elizabeth Warren.  Okay.  You know Elizabeth Warren, right?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Everything that they're feeding you as a white woman that you are is fake.  Is fake.  I don't know what me being white has to do with it.  Yeah, you being white because you haven't experienced anything that's been bad.  That's what I'm saying.  You have not experienced anything in your life.  that is bad.  Okay?  Okay.  Do you think it's maybe just to make you comfortable talking with other frustrated, sometimes angry people?  Yes, yes.  But maybe it's not true because there's no evidence of it.  It's just stuff being talked about on the internet, right?  There hasn't been any non-evidence yet.  Let me tell you, if Jesus Christ gets down off the cross and told me Trump is with Russia, I would tell him, hold on a second, I need to check with the president if it's true.  I know sometimes you kind of cringe when he says, you know, get those SOBs off the field.  That's not anything we don't hear all the time from our neighbors.  If you want to go pay that money to be a doctor, you've got to pay that money so you can make that money.  The shit can't be free.  There is nothing free.  Okay, that's free.  That's fine.  We're going to be able to keep our guns.  Our taxes are going to be lowered.  We're going to keep our Bibles, everybody.  That's the way to keep our Bibles.  The swamp is horrible.  And Trump is there.  He's there for the small guy.  He's there for people like myself.  Though his cabinet is filled with multimillionaires.  I love that.  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  We're taking our country back!  Oh, my God.  We're taking our country back! ",
