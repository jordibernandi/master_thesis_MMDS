            "text": "This is the actual tomb.  These are the rock walls of the tomb of Jesus.  That's what this is.  Did you know that the thin air, the air between your fingers, it listens.  that I'm standing inside of.  This is where, right here in front of you, this is where the stone was that was rolled away.  The footage that you're watching now is footage that I thought I had lost.  It's footage of the actual tomb of Jesus Christ.  This is where the stone was that was rolled away, right behind me.  So it's through this doorway right here that Jesus stepped, stepped through this doorway After he was in the tomb for three days, this, on this side of me, this is where his body laid.  The way God in a nutshell works is not like a cookie-cutter thing, not that there's anything wrong with that, but just kind of let the Spirit of the Lord guide it.  If we don't have anything to say, we don't.  But I began going through messages that people had written, and all of the things, their lives were flooded with lots of stuff going on.  And over the past years, what I've learned for me is that when there's a roadblock or an attack, it could even be a person, because behind the person, marionating a person with attacks, you know what the source of attacks are, the spiritual source of attacks are.  I began to realize that the Lord wants to open doors this year.  are beyond imagination for people all around this country from sea to shining city and that the things that are there it seems like something that's a horrible problem a roadblock if you look at it from one angle but then if you were to see it from another angle from a dimensional angle it's actually the lord taking you up and over things that probably should have never been there.  And more than that, let's get back to the subject of the thin air.  listens.  Because I began writing to a lot of people.  Come back full circle.  I started writing to people and realizing that you're going this way and that.  I need a pastor to pray for me.  I need this.  I need that.  I need that special person.  You don't need any special person.  The thin air has been waiting for you to talk.  That's where his body lay.  It was right over here.  And we're inside.  These are the rock walls of the actual tomb of Jesus.  That's what this is.  That's where we are.  And I'm holding, as we stand here, I'm holding a copy of the book of Enoch to the thin air.  And you know there are angels at your side, both to the right and to the left.  And I'm guessing that the fact that you're watching my videos, the fact that you've made it this far in to one of my videos, means that those aren't even, those aren't just angels that are at your side.  While you're sitting there and you think to yourself, I'm all alone, it's all falling apart, why is this happening to me?  That you've not only got angels to your right and to your left, in every room you walk in.  But more than that, that these are unusual angels at your side.  I'm willing to guess, and that'll be brought up in the end.  And why are they?  Why would that be the case?  Why is something attacking you?  Because if something's attacking, I mean, it's not attacking the guy over there or the guy over there.  Oh, no, but something's got a special interest in you, doesn't it?  I wonder why that is.  Maybe it's because when you turn things to another angle, another dimension, maybe it's because darkness loves to pile on you, doesn't it?  I guess it sees something you don't.  The cross, the cross is a symbol of our salvation.  But Jesus was risen from the dead.  This is the actual room where Jesus was risen from the dead.  And I'm just going to say a prayer right now in this room, by this doorway where the stone was.  It was rolled away.  You see something you don't, that if you could actually see who it was that you were, if you could see you like God sees you, oh, does darkness like to cover what it sees.  Well, it just gave away a secret, didn't it?  It's scared of you.  Things in another dimension, as close as the air between your fingertips, are scared of you.  So we make it back full circle.  This question of the thin air, and it listens, and the angels at your side.  Boy, if those angels had the tears of men, they would have cried an ocean at this point.  Wouldn't they?  For you.  The rooms they've sat in that you wouldn't want anybody to see.  the things you've done, the places you've been.  I'm speaking to myself, not to you.  I'm sure you're perfect on the other side of the screen.  But I have a feeling those are unusual angels.  And they've been there, they've walked with you, particularly in the moments you thought it not.  Look around the room where you're sitting.  They're in there right now.  Boo.  I just pray for every single person that's on the other side of that screen.  I pray for your families.  Lord Jesus, I ask that your Holy Spirit just come right through that screen right there.  Right through that screen where you're watching and listening to me.  The thin air is waiting for you to talk in.  When you start talking to the thin air, well, there aren't many parties out there interested in your prayers.  And the voice is because, see, one of the first things you come to find out when you begin listening to the Lord, it's not who the Lord is.  You can't even understand a single cell of this place.  You think you're going to understand God?  Oh, no, the first thing you're coming to find out is who you even are.  A lifting up that you have joy.  The joy of the Lord is our strength.  The mother of all supernatural accounts.  is the savior of mankind who died for your sins.  that's something none of us can even comprehend even comprehend that god himself became as a man god himself became as a man and laid right over here right over here in this area where this little fence guy is and that stuff that was sin.  well the torah all these things these books these are these aren't laws these are instructions These are basic teachings.  The word rabbi means teacher.  You're coming to find out that the things that were attacking you, that you thought were fun, because that's what they were telling you, because that's what the voices in your head were saying.  The voices in your head that you thought were your own thoughts.  But it never was your own thoughts coming through your own head, the pushy thoughts.  Why would you push you to do something?  Well, that would be stupid.  Are there two voices in your head?  One of them is a pushy little voice, isn't it?  Pushy, pushy, pushy little voice.  I wonder where that comes from.  That's what he did.  He paid the price for us.  And was right over here, this door behind me.  Where you see, this would have been pitch dark in here.  This room.  For three days.  And Jesus went through this doorway of light.  He was risen from the dead.  And he had paid for your sins.  Now, I'm just going to sit here.  I'm going to sit right here for a little bit.  I'm going to read to you some parts about the Savior, about our Savior, our King.  The first things that you come to realize is that the things that you thought were your own thoughts were the voice of a demon.  So who is you?  Who is you?  More than this, more than this, that the Lord wants to use you, to lift you from a mire that you can't even see and a spiritual dimension where you are clobbered by demons, boy, they like to pile on you.  The Lord wants to clear these things from your path so that there be precision where you step, where you step.  And that those things that thought they had hold of you that laughed and mocked at you and used the voices of men from the right and the left to come in like a horde and used problems and situations on top of that to compile and compress it.  Boy, did they think they had all.  I say again, the thin air listens.  This is from 45, the second parable, beginning in chapter 3.  And on that day, mine elect one, that's Jesus, who lay right over here in this room and step through this doorway that I'm sitting in, mine elect one, Jesus, shall sit on the throne of glory and shall try their works.  And their soul shall go strong within them when they've seen mine elect ones.  And those who have called upon mine glorious name and the thin air frees things.  So I might begin like this.  We're just gonna say a prayer together while we're in this room.  Because this is, it's not about, well, the cross is the symbol of our salvation.  Might begin by saying, Lord, I ask for favor in all things.  I ask for a breaking of bondage in the things I can't see that destroy and eat me alive.  Lord God, I ask for the very words to be put in my mouth that I even know what to pray and ask, that I not look like a fool in dimensions and places that are beyond me.  Lord God, I ask, and don't ask for specific things.  Don't ask for a boyfriend.  I want this guy.  I want that guy.  Stop asking for idiocy.  Lord, that your will be done.  You don't even know who you want.  How do you know what you want when you don't even know who you are?  We've all been listening to devils in this place, and I'm not speaking to you.  I'm speaking to me.  I'm the fool here.  You're the one that knew all this.  Without you, how would I know any of this?  No, I bet I am speaking to you, haven't I?  Then I will cause my elect one to dwell among them and I will transform heaven and make it into light and full of blessing.  Chapter 46, let me go down.  And there I saw one who had a head of days and his head was like white wool.  This is God we're talking about.  And with him was another, the same mother that was in this room and walked through this door.  appearance of a man Lord but the words in my mouth as I know not what to ask that I not look like a fool in dimensions and places that are beyond me.  father God remove the demons from my life that I've not been able to see every single thing the things that I can see detect and the things I cannot.  Lord, give me favor in my footsteps where I walk and where I step in this dimension and the next.  Father God, I ask that above all else in this place that I, whatever your name is, not miss heaven.  His head was like white wool and with him was another whose appearance was like that of a man and his face was full of grace like one of the holy angels.  And I asked the angel who went with me, there was an angel standing here at this door.  When the women came to the tomb in the morning, there was an angel standing by this door.  Why do you look for the living amongst the dead?  His face was full of grace, Jesus' who laid here for three days.  His face was full of grace like one of the holy angels.  And I asked the angel who went with me and showed me these hidden things concerning this one, this son of man.  who he was, whence he was, and why he accompanied the head, the ancient of days.  But more than that, Lord, that your will be done, your will, Yod-Heh-Vov-Heh, the creator of the universe, will be done over my own, in this place, in this life, and the next.  And the angel answered and said unto me, This son of man that thou now behold.  This Son of Man hath all righteousness, and with whom all righteousness dwell, and who revealeth all of the secret things, which for now are hidden, because the Lord of Spirits hath chosen him, him, Yahshua, and whose lot has been prepared before the Lord of Spirits.  Father God, I ask that your will Father God in heaven that your will become my heart's desire that my heart's desire be to serve you in all of my ways in all of my days.  I and this son of man whom thou hast seen shall raise up the kings and the mighty from their thrones.  He shall loosen the reins of the strong and break to pieces the teeth of the sinners.  I ask that when I stumble and fall that I dust off fast.  I ask that the demons that hold from this right and the left that the angels at my side which you placed there have now been given authority to destroy every evil thing every chain and every piece of bondage that surrounds or encircles me.  forty seven and in those days i saw the head of days when he was seated upon the throne of his glory And the books of the living, the books of the living on the mountain Sinai, where Moses was, a book of the living.  Moses, block my name from your book.  Put theirs in my stead, he said on that mountain.  I pray for the very air in the rooms I walk and the dimensions I step into, that your light and your spirit flow in.  I ask that the doors that are meant to be opened before me be opened, and I walk in not stumbling as a fool, but with precision.  Lord God, more than this, that every door in this place is full of doors.  There are doors within doors, like a maze that could trap, ensnare and strangle some, whilst freeing and leading to sheer glory.  and the books of the living were opened before him, and all his hosts, which are in heaven... Give me just a couple of minutes, man.  And all his hosts, which are in heaven... And his counselors stood before him.  I've got some groups that need to come in.  Okay, give me just one second.  Can I do that?  Two more minutes, two more minutes.  And the books of the living were opened before him, and all of the hearts of the holy were filled with joy, because the number of the righteous had been offered, and the prayer of the righteous heard, and the blood of... Are you just going to stand at the door?  I have one sentence left for you.  Okay.  And the blood of the righteous one had been required before the Lord of Spirits.  I'd always... planned for years to do the Exodus in a way that there would be nothing like it on earth.  I never quite planned anything like this.  Because I wanted one more thing when I thought about the Exodus.  One more thing that I wanted.  Because to do an Exodus and to do it right You need, what do you need for an exodus?  Well, baby, you need the waters to part.  I'm Trey Smith of God in a Nutshell.  More than that, I'm a servant.  I'm a servant of the king.  The king of kings, the king of glory.  God says, out of Egypt did I call my son.  It was out of Egypt, this land where I stand, where he followed his people.  The place of the pharaohs.  And I'll give you one more hint of where the pharaoh of the Exodus was.  As I make this corner right here, I'm going to point you to a real big clue standing right behind me up there.  You know what those obelisks represent?  I don't want my home anymore.  You say you want my heart. ",
