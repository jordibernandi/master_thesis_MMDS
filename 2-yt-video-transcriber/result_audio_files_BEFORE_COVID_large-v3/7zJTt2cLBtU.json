            "text": "So it looks like Gardena Police are up in somebody's driveway.  You guys know the names of the guys I'm looking for?  The police themselves ran over a tree in the process of running into that vehicle.  is what it looks like to me.  No shortage of Gardena Police units here.  I expect they'll be ending this party prematurely.  By the way, they ran over people's plants and trees and up on to this private property.  I'm going to assume that at least they're going to say that this was some type of a pursuit, right?  But it doesn't look like they killed anybody as far as I can tell.  So how is it?  somebody calls about a stolen bicycle and they come out and shoot the victim that called for help?  We've got a suspect over here, but As far as I'm concerned, every one of these guys over here are suspects.  Any one of them could be Matthew Fong Toda.  For some reason, I can never get all three names.  There's a Christopher Sanderson, who I've already identified to you.  And there's another Christopher.  Any one of these guys, though, could be him.  Mendez.  The third name is Christopher Mendez.  And that guy looked like he could have very easily been Christopher Mendez.  Looks Hispanic.  I think the name sounds Hispanic.  Right?  Of course, I've been talking about Gardena.  They're trying to identify these other two police who are murdering innocent people without a single consequence to their action.  This happened quite a while back.  It only got pushed to the front because the city of Gardena started false flagging old videos from five and six years ago trying to get my channel taken down.  You may or may not have noticed I've got thousands of videos that are still on private because of the cowardly actions.  I just got another friendly hello there.  Because of the actions of the city of Gardena.  As much as I would love to spend the rest of my life chasing around Gardena police on this old incident, I'm going to probably wrap it up in an hour, hour and a half long, single, full-length feature film about the city of Gardena.  If police only release what they want the public to see, I think that makes it propaganda.  Everything you need to know about the city of Gardena.  Paul Tanaka was found guilty of federal corruption charges today.  You little stupid-ass bitch, I ain't fucking with you.  We do believe that there was overwhelming evidence.  I don't see how he's ranked amongst the best.  The city of Gardena.  It's known as the freeway city.  Morning, Officer Jones, how you doing?  How do you talk to somebody on the sidewalk in the middle of a high-speed pursuit?  Hey, Metro, I'm in pursuit.  We're approaching Rosecrans.  Speed is pretty... How do you talk to somebody on the sidewalk while you're in the middle of a pursuit?  I know the answer.  You don't.  You don't.  That's how you do it.  In case you didn't know... Hey, I have a question for you.  How do you talk to somebody on the sidewalk when you're in the middle of a pursuit?  Malicious and ignorant.  I'm here recording Officer Salas.  She's calling for backup right now.  I think she just seen me.  You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fucking with you.  Is there a reason for that camera there?  Badge number?  You can see the badge numbers.  It's on your badge.  You know what officer wants me to get in their face to read a badge number.  Why would you keep that a secret?  Because I'm not going to give it to you.  95 police officers, 24 full-time support staff.  Why would you call the police on me?  Why would you call the police?  It doesn't make any sense.  I'm on my way to the city clerk's office.  My camera wasn't even on.  And she starts confronting me and telling me that stuff.  Maybe they assume it's on.  Maybe she doesn't know you have a right.  Well, come on.  Is it worth getting upset about?  Maybe she just doesn't know.  I'm not upset.  She's upset.  She's the one trying to tell me I have to leave.  Maybe it's just not newsworthy.  I'm here with our Officer of the Year winner, Detective Patrick Goodpaster.  You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fucking with you.  Oh, we love our officers.  Do you not have permission?  I didn't ask your permission.  33 part-time employees.  Well, you have some idiot named Gonsalves out driving around.  Yeah, but he's out.  He's out.  He's out right now in his car giving unlawful orders, acting like an idiot.  Come on over here, Gonsalves.  You got something to say?  Ordering cyclists to get off the road when they're supposed to be on the road.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Come here, pussycat!  You're blocking traffic, pussycat!  You little stupid-ass bitch, I ain't fucking with you!  And what do you know, there's your solace.  We had a little confrontation in the lobby.  Get out of my face.  Mr.  Pendergrass, maybe you better climb in the lobby.  You got an officer that's out of control down here.  Relax.  I don't relax.  Get back the fuck out of my face.  Back up.  Don't touch me or my camera again.  Back up, asshole.  Oh, me?  Yeah, you.  Back up.  I'm not going to back up.  You know, you got me in a corner.  Get the fuck out of my face.  And of course, the Gardena Police refused to release their video of me getting attacked by a police officer in the lobby because they said it could compromise the safety of the police department if all the public knew the capabilities of their cameras, right?  That's just another stupid fucking lie.  Today we're learning how to search people's property, steal from them.  But I must say, nice suits these guys have.  And it's pretty damn hilarious that Gardena police pretend to be in a position to train cadets as police officers.  If you haven't seen the video of the cyclists, the Gardena police will shoot you.  They will kill you in cold blood if at any time they can't see one of your hands.  I knew it from some government agency trying to keep it under wraps.  Nah.  Let's see, Gardena, it's a perfect example of why the police should not have the authority to decide what they release and what they don't.  Because while they cry about privacy concerns for the citizen, but the videos they refuse to release are the ones that the cops don't want anybody to see.  Brutality, human rights violations, stupidity.  Sure, that'd be great.  The city of Gardena called me and told me they had my records ready.  In particular, the video of Officer Rosales attacking me in the lobby.  So I peddled all the way down there and they gave me a piece of paper that says... It says the chief of police has determined a public interest in withholding temporary tapes that could disclose critical infrastructure clearly outweighs a public interest in disclosing them.  Wrong answer.  Can I speak with the chief?  Saying you're throwing me out because I'm recording... How am I... I'm not going to argue with you either, so close your lips and we won't have nothing to talk about.  I'm waiting for their response.  Do you have any paperwork you need to take?  Take your paperwork and let's go.  Okay, I'll walk myself out.  I don't need you to touch me.  I'll walk myself out.  I'm not going to touch you.  Let's go.  Excuse me, sir.  You don't need to pull my chair out from underneath me.  Let's go.  Mr.  Pendergrass, maybe you could explain to me.  Step outside.  Listen to the sergeant.  I don't have any respect for Sergeant Gonsalves.  I don't have to listen to anything he has to say.  Well, good.  I'm waiting for Pendergrass.  I'm waiting for Pendergrass.  You go on your own.  I'm waiting for you, Mr.  Pendergrass.  I'm not talking to this clown.  I'm waiting for you.  Pendergrass might be the biggest clown of them all.  I peddled all the way down here to get the records that they called me and asked me to come and pick up.  It was just a big trick.  Apparently, they were trying to get a restraining order on me.  The judge didn't grant it.  Right, I understand.  But there's another portion to this that I think that you miss, and that is maybe that uncomfortable feeling that people get.  Being recorded?  I mean, in a sense, being recorded.  But second, maybe the way that you're looking at them or just making them feel uncomfortable.  They just don't want themselves being on YouTube and being uploaded to, and they would prefer that you didn't record them when you came in.  And if your point is to You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fucking with you!  Okay, you can't bullshit me.  I know these laws.  I know the laws we're talking about.  I can come into the station, and I can record, and it doesn't matter if you like it or if you don't.  You little dumbass bitch ain't fucking with you.  I'm not saying that.  And I do not have to inform you, and I do not have to get your consent.  You're more than aware of that.  Secretly audio video recording?  Who's secretly audio?  You used to have secret cameras.  If you sit here and mislead me, I'm going to upload the Our conversation, not telling the truth, or if you are telling the truth, you're not being, or you're not intelligent.  And you have to be, you have to be honest with me.  They just didn't want to give me evidence of their crimes.  And Gardena's really consistent with that.  That's the reason that they've arrested me each time, you know, and the reason they kept my, always kept my cameras for months at a time.  Gardena police are still harassing cyclists on the street.  No remorse for killing those kids at all. ",
