            "text": "Hi, I'm Dr.  Buchanek, and today I want to talk about Boris Johnson and I think his inability to effectively conclude Brexit.  For three years, I've been saying that Theresa May was not qualified to really negotiate a multilateral deal for England in terms of getting it out of the EU.  The reason is multivariate, but the point is we have an issue of the hard border in Ireland.  We have an issue with independent Scotland.  We have an issue of what exactly economically will it mean to England.  Those were not handled very well.  Instead, what happened, Boris Johnson was nominated as the Prime Minister of the Conservative Party.  Now, on the face of it, it looks fine, although he seems to be quite a character.  He was a writer, a novelist, a journalist.  the Mayor of London and the Secretary of Foreign Policy.  The real issue for me is that he's a pathological liar because what he really hasn't talked about is the fact that, number one, he was not born in England.  He wasn't born in the British Isles.  He was born in New York City.  He was born on the east side of New York City.  He was born to a father who went to Columbia and worked at the World Bank, which is not exactly a premier institution.  other than that, that we collect a bunch of intelligence operatives and they all sit there like they do at the UN doing nothing.  Number two, Boris Johnson's mother is named Lowe, L-O-W-E.  Her original name was Fawcett, but her maiden name was Lowe.  And who she is is far more important than anything else.  She is the granddaughter and daughter of Orthodox Jewish rabbis from Lithuania.  That's correct, dear.  What the papers did not write is that Boris Johnson, as much as he prevaricated and talked and did all the nonsensical things that he's been doing, did not mention the fact that he grew up Jewish.  Now, I don't have a problem with that, except our intelligence report says that in 1984, he spent a lot of time on a kibbutz or moshav in Israel.  Now, most of the time, English Jews are not a problem.  For the most part, the most famous prime minister of all, who was also Jewish, was Disraeli, who existed from 1820 to 1888.  He was the prime minister to Queen Victoria, and he had bought part of the Suez Canal thanks to Nathan Rothschild.  But what I'm really getting at is I'm not sure where Boris Johnson's loyalty really remains, whether it's England, the United States, or Israel.  The concern I have for Boris Johnson and the fact that he's a sociopath and a liar is very much the same thing.  I was concerned with Jeffrey Epstein.  There's no question that Boris Johnson has been co-opted by the Mossad.  When you go into kibbutz in 1984, you are completely involved with Israeli intelligence, particularly if you do not belong to Israel or you do not live in Israel full time.  They will use you as an operative and as an agent.  No mention was made of that anywhere in his history.  I had to go back to the intelligence files.  to really look up how close was he to Israel.  Well, he's close enough that Beebe wrote to him Mazel Tov in Yiddish and in Hebrew, where we say to another Jew Mazel Tov.  Number two, Herzog, the head of the World Jewish Congress, says we have a very close friend here in Boris Johnson.  That concerns me.  That concerns me because I'm not sure the interests of England are fully served by Boris Johnson.  He's not truthful, as we know.  He's not very efficient, as we know, and he's not very effective.  By nature, he has a sociopathic polymath career.  That is, he's willing to do a lot of things, but none of them well.  With Brexit, you need a capability that's very strategic and tactical.  You also need to know high finances and the ability to garner all types of issues into one package.  That means what is the EU going to involve?  Who in the EU are you going to be dealing with?  Are you dealing really with Brussels or are you dealing with England's old enemy, Germany?  In short, I have doubts about Brexit.  I do not want England to go into it.  Let me quote the Jewish proverb that says, truth is a heavy, heavy element.  That's why very few people carry it.  Good night and good luck. ",
