            "text": "All esteem to the Most High Elohim and Shabbat Shalom family.  This is your brother El.  You all know that I always love to give spotlight to our brothers and sisters that are out here doing amazing work for the kingdom.  I love to give spotlight to Hebrew entrepreneurs.  I love to give spotlight to other brothers and sisters that are reaching our people through whatever means or venue that the Father has enabled them to do.  And today I want to highlight the good brother Judiah and Kai Yeshua Ministries for this amazing, excellent His Word.  Hebrew Israelite Scriptures 1611 Gold Edition.  I was able to get my hands on one of these and I thank the Father for it.  This right here is a scripture that commemorates the 400 years 1619 to this current year.  It's the gold edition, 1611.  This particular Bible has the Old Testament, the New Testament, and also the apocryphal scriptures, such as the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, such as the first and second books of Esdras.  This is powerful family.  I've always told brothers and sisters that we need to stop supporting these Gentile owned publishing companies that don't do nothing but produce these Bibles.  And in a lot of these Gentile Bibles, they have more commentary from these Gentile heathen theologians that really don't know what they're talking about more so than they got the scriptures itself.  Not so with this project right here, family.  This is the straight word and nothing but the word of the most high.  Also, the images in here are powerful, depicting our people as we truly were.  the melanated Hebrew man and woman.  The images in here are just as powerful as the presentation and the scriptures.  This is especially key for a lot of our young ones who get so used to seeing these Bibles with all these white European images that we know are false.  But this Bible right here, these scriptures have us presented in our true light.  And this is a company, this is a ministry that is run by Hebrews.  This particular scripture, this is by Hebrews for the believers of the Most High.  I would definitely recommend, family, that you get your hands on one of these.  Support our people.  Support the true images of our people being put out there.  Support what the Most High is doing in waking us up.  Once again, this is the His Word.  Hebrew Israelite Scripture 1611 edition gold commemorating the 400 years.  Some other good things I like about this is it has the Hebrew words of all the scriptural books.  It has the Hebrew words right next to it.  There's no pagan names in this Bible.  No God, Lord, none of those pagan names.  Just the true name of the Most High and also the true name of the Holy Spirit, the Ruach HaKadosh.  It's just beautiful, family.  So I pray that you get your hands on one of these.  I'll put the link in the description box.  I'll also put a link to Kai Yeshua Ministries so you can connect with some great work that they're doing.  Those are definitely some anointed brothers and sisters over there.  Blessings to Brother Jedi, his beautiful children, his wife.  Please support this work.  These Hebrew Israelite scriptures.  Once again, check out the link in the description box.  There's nothing else I have to say about this family because this Bible speaks for itself.  This is one of those scriptures that, you know, in the time to come, They're going to be totally getting rid of the availability of the scriptures online.  As it says in the book of Isaiah, that there will come a time where there's a famine for the word of the most high, because they're going to do a total blackout on the scriptures being put online and other venues.  So, number one, we have to have the word hidden in our heart.  And number two.  We always have to have a physical material sword that we carry with us.  And this right here, this Bible is going to be one that's in my bug out bag for the wilderness.  This is going to be scriptures that I carry with me at all times.  That's how powerful this is, family.  And the best thing about it, it's made by Hebrews.  This is our people putting this together, family.  Ain't that beautiful?  That's what you call Hebrew excellence, Israelite greatness.  This is what I'm always talking about on my channel of our people doing great things, exploits, putting together projects that impact nations.  And this is one of those.  So much love to the brothers, the Daya and Kai Yeshua Ministries and the work that they do.  get your hands on one of these family.  I'm just going to let these images of these scriptures just continue to play on and check it out for yourself.  All right.  Shabbat Shalom. ",
