            "text": "I've been on this road a while, and I'd like to tell you my story.  The great American poet Robert Frost once wrote, Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled, and that has made all the difference.  Growing up, I never seemed to find that road, the road less traveled.  I'd like to say that all roads lead to somewhere, but reality is, some roads lead to nowhere.  Born out of wedlock in the 1950s, my mom was married and divorced seven times.  She traveled a road of chaos, self-destruction, filled with alcohol abuse, pain, hurt, confusion, no trust.  And I traveled it with her.  As a product of the 60s, I began to choose my own path, ironically leading me to drinking and partying, but ending up in drug abuse.  Searching for acceptance and love, all that left me empty.  You know, some people say sin is fun, and I'd agree, but that's only for a short, short season.  And all that's left is just a dull ache.  In the summer of my senior year in high school, I heard words I'd never heard before.  There was someone who loved me, someone who would never leave me, and someone I could trust.  I made a conscious decision that day to choose a different road to travel.  In the past 40 years, this life that I've been living has led me to share my experiences with literally millions of people looking for truth.  I have the privilege of pastoring Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, California, and now a new venture of faith, Harvest Orange County.  I've traveled this world sharing this life-changing message to the platform of the Harvest Crusades.  Has my life been perfect?  No, far from it.  There's been a lot of obstacles to overcome, a lot of storms to weather.  Has it been free from pain?  No.  I have experienced deep, deep pain.  The loss of my oldest son Christopher in 2008 in an automobile accident was the most challenging time of my life for my wife Kathy and myself.  But it's on this road that I've chosen where I have found comfort and peace and forgiveness and meaning.  And that is why I'll never stop traveling on it.  Jesus said, broad is the way that leads to destruction, but narrow is the way that leads to life.  I'm on that narrow road that leads to life now, and I hope you'll join me. ",
