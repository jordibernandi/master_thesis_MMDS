            "text": "One of the most popular songs that Hillsong has ever done is a song called Oceans.  And everybody seems to know this catchy little tune, but I'm going to tell you what this song is really about.  And I'm going to warn you, you're not going to like it.  This is going to blow your mind.  So let's read the lyrics together.  You call me out upon the waters, the great unknown where feet may fail.  And there I find you in the mystery and oceans deep.  My faith will stand.  Do you see it?  It's right there in front of your face.  Do you not see that?  Do you not understand that God didn't give them this song?  That there was another spirit that gave them this song?  It's right.  Do you not see it?  Do you not see it?  Well, I'll show you. ",
