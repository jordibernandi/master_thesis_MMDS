            "text": "So, Tulsi Gabbard went on Fox News, and she did a superb job resisting Trump in the proper way, which is from the left.  You know, one of my main criticisms of corporate Democrats is that they often resist Trump from the right, and that's a terrible idea, because what you're doing is you're bolstering right-wing policies, and you're prodding him to be more hawkish, and that's unacceptable.  So Tulsi really does a great job here.  She puts on a clinic in resisting Trump from the left and staying principled as she resists against Trump.  So this is something other Democrats struggle with.  Tulsi does not.  Let's take a look and then we'll discuss. ",

It's not confirmed by the Pentagon or the administration yet, but they're citing South Korean news agencies and agencies over there.  That would mean, if true, that 591 days have passed since the last missile was fired.  You're on House Armed Services.  Your thoughts, if that turns out to be the case. ",

            "text": "Well, look, Brett, obviously we need to determine the facts and get the details of what has actually happened here.  But I think it's important to address the larger issue, which is that we still need to continue to pursue our efforts with negotiations with North Korea to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and finally bring about an end to the Korean War.  I think in this connection, it is also important to note why it is that we have not made progress on that deal and we can look to the policies being pushed by this administration that are directly undermining their ability to negotiate this deal those policies that are continuing to further regime change wars and regime change efforts in other countries like venezuela and iran that that make it impossible for kim jong-un to believe them when they tell him don't worry get rid of your nuclear weapons we're not going to come after you.  so how would you like their own credibility in the ability by changing our policies.  This is not something that can happen overnight, but it begins with ending our regime change wars in other countries, ending our regime change efforts, as we are seeing in these countries like Venezuela and Iran, so that when we negotiate with North Korea, with Kim Jong-un, and we tell him that we will not come after you we will not seek to topple your regime.  if you get rid of your nuclear weapons understanding that this is why north korea has nuclear weapons as the only deterrent against regime change then we begin to have that credibility to be able to have that agreement basically that objective of denuclearization.

Something?  Oh, that was great.  So basically what Tulsi Gabbard is saying is this.  I support peace.  I support negotiation and compromise and open dialogue with other countries, including our enemies.  That's how you make peace.  You talk to your enemies.  But I'm consistent on that.  So what Trump is doing and the administration is doing that's so wrong is not, oh my God, they're talking to Kim Jong-un and that's terrible.  That's the argument that hacky Democrats make.  What Tulsi Gabbard is saying is, no, no, no, it's great.  It's wonderful that you're talking to Kim Jong-un and I hope you get a peace deal.  But the problem is that look at what you're doing in Venezuela where you're trying to topple a country that is in no way, shape, or form a threat to us and they're not going to attack us and you're threatening to offensively overthrow them.  and do regime change.  Look at what you're doing in Syria, look at what you're doing in Iraq, look at what we're still doing in Afghanistan.  So at the same time, Trump pretends like, oh yeah, yeah, no, totally, Kim Jong-un, you can trust me, let's make a deal, bro.  At the same time he's saying that, he's actively trying to topple and overthrow countless other governments.  So why the fuck should Kim Jong-un believe you?  Now furthermore, you go back to the Obama administration, and you go back to Bush as well, but for this particular example, it's the Obama administration, What do they do?  You know, with Gaddafi in Libya, they were like, give up your weapons.  And Gaddafi gave them up because he's like, shit, I saw what happened to Saddam, so I don't want that happening to me, so okay, here, take my weapons.  And the U.S.  turned around and aided in toppling Libya anyway, and toppled Gaddafi anyway.  So what you need to understand is that message resonates around the world.  So you think like, our enemy governments trust us if we have some sort of deal.  Look at what happened with Iran.  That's another example Tulsi brings up.  Trump, at the same time he's trying to create some sort of a nuclear peace agreement with Kim Jong-un in North Korea, he's ripping up a nuclear peace agreement with Iran and pulled out of it, even though the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said, oh yeah, they're following the agreement to a T and they're doing nothing wrong.  So you're basically ripped up the Iran deal with Iran, and now you're trying to make an Iran deal with Kim Jong-un?  That makes no sense.  And what I love about Tulsi saying this is, even with this new missile test that Kim Jong-un is doing, she didn't take the bait. ",

            "text": "Tulsi didn't take the bait.  You want to know why Tulsi didn't take the bait?  Because she actually understands that North Korea is not a threat to us.  Not even in the slightest.  In fact, in moments of honesty, our own generals have admitted this.  People in our own intelligence agencies have admitted this.  They say, listen, we think North Korea wants a nuke for deterrence.  Because they think that we're about to topple them, so they just want to have something to ensure that we won't topple them.  They have no interest in attacking us.  None at all.  So... Tulsi Gabbard knows that, and a random fucking missile testing doesn't change that fact at all, that they are not an offensive threat to us.  By the way... You want to talk about real political incorrectness?  It's what I just said right there.  People on the right love to feign like they're being politically incorrect.  No, oftentimes you're just incorrect.  You're not politically incorrect.  What you're saying isn't edgy.  It's just dumb, and it's just wrong.  You want to know the real politically incorrect shit to say?  What I just said right now.  North Korea is not a threat to us, not even a little bit.  When all of mainstream media, wall to wall, they act like, Oh my, Kim Jong-un, oh my god, what a threat to us.  Nonsense!  Nonsense!  It's politically incorrect, but it's true to say that Kim Jong-un and North Korea are not even close to a threat to us.  There, I said it.  Go ahead, melt down, snowflakes.  I don't give a fuck.  Centrist Democrats and right-wingers.  But Tulsi Gabbard gets that.  And credit to her for sticking to a principled position of being anti-war in the face of somebody trying to prod her to be pro-war.  So, well done.  This is great work here.  And I really don't think any other Democrat, except maybe Ro Khanna, would have said something similar.  So, wonderful stuff here from Tulsi.  That's how you resist from the left.  You stay true to a principled position.  And you try to hold them to that principle.  You don't, like, pivot for... for convenience, you don't change your position for expedience, for political expedience, to do a gotcha real quick.  Because then you come across like a hack. ",
