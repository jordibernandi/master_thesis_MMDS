            "text": "Hey, hello everybody.  This is an update about the YouTube channel here, Ernest Bontrager.  Ernest Bontrager is my father.  He passed away in 2018 to kidney complications.  It's an unexpected event to say the least.  I just got access finally to the YouTube page to where we can start making videos and oriented around videos like my father made, for instance.  I wish I would have paid attention to him when he was making them.  The first ones might be not near as good as what he does, but I'm a quick learner.  We'll do our best here at the Bond Trigger family to... put good quality videos out for you guys' viewing.  Back in 2001, shortly after September 11th, I believe it was September 14th, my father needed to fly out to Omaha, Nebraska to have a liver transplant.  And as you remember, back then, all airplanes were grounded.  My father was one of the only few planes that were able to fly that shortly after September 11th.  He had to get to Omaha, Nebraska within like eight to 10 hours.  He made it, had the liver transplant, but the problem was that his body rejected that liver.  So he had to have an emergency liver transplant.  And because of the rejection of the first one, it shut his body down, which created kidney complications.  He did dialysis quite a bit.  Just before he got his kidney transplant, he was doing dialysis three times a week.  And for anybody that knows anybody that does dialysis or that does dialysis themselves, knows that's horrible.  It takes every ounce of energy out of you that you have.  So theoretically, In that time frame, we only had probably about a day and a half of him having enough strength.  Just to say, go out and get something to eat.  His favorite restaurant was Red Lobster.  He loved seafood.  The kidney that he got in his transplant got rejected.  And after you get a rejection, it's highly unlikely that you'll get another kidney to to give it a go again.  He was going to have to be on dialysis for the rest of his life, and that's what he wanted to do was get away from dialysis and kidney transplant.  Everything was going good, and then it didn't go so well.  This YouTube page is part of an inheritance for my soon-to-be 14-year-old son, myself, and my mother.  Now that I have access to it, we will be able to create videos.  Hope you like the content.  Like I said, we'll do a lot of videos that are oriented around my father's videos that he did.  He had a thousand videos, I believe.  with nearly thirty million views on all his videos.  quite a defeat.  he was always the person behind the camera.  he loved to be behind camera capturing everybody's uh... motions from happy to hey get that camera out of my face.  you know those kind of things uh.  but he was always the one that was doing it.  vhs tapes eight millimeter.  uh eight millimeter tapes.  i remember those when i was a kid seeing those being shot up on a white sheet or even a wall.  and uh due to his health complications he was very limited in what he was able to do for work.  uh did a eBay very big on eBay.  but then he started making his passion and that was video and he brought a lot of videos to a lot of people people's enjoyment.  not all videos are for everybody but a lot of people liked a lot of things and to each their own.  I really appreciate the time that it took to watch this video.  Like I said, this is my father's YouTube page and I will do the best I can do to bring you great content.  I really appreciate you guys watching this video and that's the update.  See you soon. ",
