            "text": "Folks in the South love dip.  It's a part of life.  Just like city folks have manicures and sushi as a part of their life.  Yes, women in the South dip too.  And yes, it turns me on.  You know what?  The only thing I am worried about is getting a boner.  If you have a suggestion or a question for me, feel free to follow me on Instagram and I'll do my best to answer as many as I can.  So this video is going to be about what dip says about you as a person.  Hopefully it's good.  Okay, so we'll start off easy.  Copenhagen Wintergreen.  Your buddy called you a wuss in freshman baseball because you wouldn't try any.  Finally, you gave in to peer pressure and you tried some.  Your first thought is, screw girls, I'm marrying Copenhagen.  Fast forward 25 years where dip is $6.99 a can and not 99 cents anymore and you're spending half your paycheck every week to buy dip.  Thank God you don't live in Canada where it's almost $40 a can.  What kind of dip is that?  They give you a gold coin at the bottom of the can or what?  Next up we have Siberia.  You're a YouTuber who makes a living by being a dumbass.  Nobody actually likes Siberia because it gives you a buzz longer lasting than the buzz you get in army boot camp.  You are the type of person who will literally do anything for a dollar or some attention.  You know what I mean?  Like do you expect me to believe you're gonna use Siberia on a daily basis?  That's like eating coffee grinds for energy instead of just drinking coffee and knucklehead.  It's making noise over there.  The non tobacco dipper.  No one who dips gives a mother about what it does to your lips or gums.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Use non tobacco dip because it's healthier and it doesn't burn as much.  Wow.  But Dan, there's still nicotine in it and it gives you like the same kind of buzz.  Fair enough.  I see your situation, but I'll also raise you a situation.  Let's say you're blindfolded and you're getting a blow job from two different people.  One is a girl.  who's a supermodel, and one is a guy with the world's longest tongue.  Nine times out of ten, they're probably going to both feel just as good.  The problem is that one is from a dude.  If you weren't blindfolded, hopefully you'd have an issue with that.  Same thing with non-tobacco dip.  It's just not the real thing, no matter how you look at it, even if you're blindfolded.  Hello.  Yeah?  I'm here for the gangbang.  Next up, we have Longhorn Tobacco.  Longhorn Tobacco is drier than how dry your girlfriend's gonna be when the whole dad bod trend is over with because you don't go to the gym.  And the only reason why you buy it is because that's all you can afford after you pay off all your child support payments.  I'm willing to bet the makers of Longhorn Dip have the same business model as Champ from Anchorman 2.  Oh man, I can't wait to try some of this dip.  Bro, what is in this?  The market is way too flooded with tobacco companies right now, so putting half dirt in the cans is just the only way we can make a profit.  No one can tell the difference though, so it's all good.  Listen, can I ask you a question?  Sure, anything.  Is this chicken?  Hell no.  It's really impossible to turn a profit if you serve real chicken.  You know, we use mainly bats.  But the good quality kind.  The messy dipper.  You're the reason why a lot of women don't like men who dip.  So I can speak for all of us fellow dippers out there when I say... When you put a dip in, more dip ends up on your shirt than it does in your mouth.  Trust me, that's pretty hard to do.  You're the guy who shaves his beard and just leaves it all in the sink for three weeks until your wife comes home from her vacation with her sugar daddy because you make minimum wage.  Last but not least, the fruity dip.  You like Skull Peach because it tastes good?  Oh, okay, that explains why you like sucking on big man nuts.  You like the taste.  Okay.  Hey, no problem.  As a man, you dipping cherry skull instead of Copenhagen straight is the equivalent of you wearing a red G-string instead of boxers.  What's up, bro?  Why are you wearing your chick's G-string?  Oh, they're not hers, bro.  No.  No, they were having a sale down on 6th Street and got six pairs.  I'm going to wear them to the pool this year, show off these gains.
