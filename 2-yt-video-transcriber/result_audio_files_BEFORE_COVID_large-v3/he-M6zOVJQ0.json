            "text": "Cool kids today always talk about sipping tea, don't they?  But I don't like tea.  So I said today we're going to sip a caffeinated beverage with a hell of a lot of sugar and other things in it while we spill the metaphorical tea on women in Islam.  Hi, everyone.  By the way, hello.  If you're new here, my name's Rachel.  If you're not new here, that's also my name, but whatever.  Basically, I am here to talk about things with you and have a little bit of a giggle.  I talk about atheism-y stuff.  I talk about science-y stuff.  I talk about books and fun stuff.  If you are new here, it would be amazing if you could subscribe.  You know, leave me a comment.  Let me know what you think of this video.  Just support my channel a little bit.  Help me grow, get better.  That's what I want.  And if you've been around for a while, hey, how you doing?  Good to see you again.  Today's video is one that I figured would be kind of controversial anyway because I am talking about Islam.  Not just talking about Islam but kind of criticizing some aspects of Islam and therefore I figured I'm probably gonna get hate anyway.  so why not just have a little bit of fun with it.  I found this great book earlier this week called You Can Be the Happiest Woman in the World, a treasure chest of reminders and it is written by an author who is a Muslim, and it is published by the International Islamic Publishing House.  It basically uses the Quran and other Islamic teachings to teach you how to be a happy woman.  You can be the happiest woman in the world if you follow these teachings of Islam.  And there's only a little bit of stoning to death involved, so... Now quick reminder, the fact that I might be making a few jokes and being a little bit silly and more casual in this video does not at all downplay the fact that the stuff they are teaching in this book is incredibly serious and damaging and dangerous.  The fact that this sort of thing is being taught to millions of women around the world and not only that but millions of women are being forced to live this way is incredibly dangerous and terrifying and something needs to be done about it.  This is why we need feminism right here.  The introduction writes that this book urges the Muslim woman to rejoice in her religion and in the grace that Allah has bestowed upon her.  It brings hope and glad tidings to everyone who feels distressed, depressed, and burdened with many worries.  Sounds pretty nice, doesn't it?  It addresses her rational mind and pure heart, telling her to be patient and seek reward with Allah.  Do not despair, do not give up, be optimistic for Allah is with you.  Allah is sufficient for you.  Allah the Almighty will protect you.  Kinda makes you wonder what she is protecting from, isn't it?  Is it child marriages?  Female genital mutilation?  Stoning to death?  Definitely the last one if we're gonna listen to anything in this book.  The author encourages women to read this book and chase away the traces of sadness, the specters of distress, the nightmares of fear and anxiety.  Read this book to help you cleanse your mind of the clutter of illusions and devilish whispers.  Can't say that, clearly I'm possessed.  and show you the way to a sense of tranquility, faith, joy, and happiness.  May Allah give you happiness in this world and in the hereafter, and bestow his favor upon you, for he is the most generous, most kind.  Just because you say it doesn't make it true.  It begins with, almost like a poem, welcoming all women.  Welcome, oh devout, Allah-fearing woman who prays and fasts.  You'll see a lot of this repeated in the book about fearing Allah.  Fear him, fear, fear, fear.  Apparently fear is the key to happiness.  Who knew?  And there was me being stupid, thinking that, you know, happiness was basically the absence of fear, amongst other things.  Silly Western woman, aren't I?  Living by myself, being financially independent, not relying on parents or a husband.  What do I know?  How can I ever be happy?  Welcome, a wise, dignified woman who observes hijab.  Yeah, you can't be wise or dignified unless all of this is proper.  Oh, sorry, Bean.  Welcome, oh mother of heroes and producer of men.  Because remember, you only have worth if you are popping out babies, and only then if they're men.  If they're a woman, half points.  Welcome, oh woman who heeds the sacred limits of Allah and keeps away from forbidden things.  You know, like joy and happiness and independence.  Another poem type thing.  There are two in this series.  They are quite creatively titled, Yes and No.  No!  You saw that coming, eh?  Yes to your beautiful smile that sends a message of warmth and friendliness to others.  Yes to your kind words that establish friendship, as permitted in Islam, and dispel rancour.  Friendship?  Great, love it.  But only the ones we say.  Yes, to acceptable charity that brings happiness to the poor and feeds the hungry.  Yes, to sitting with the Quran and reciting it, pondering its meanings and acting upon them, and repenting and seeking forgiveness because you're a dirty sinner, you bitch.  Yes, to raising your children in Islam, teaching them from the sunnah, and guiding them to that which will benefit them.  Don't worry baby, I'm not going to be raising you in Islam.  Oh god, can you imagine it?  My daughter here, not only is she female, but she's a dog.  That must be like what?  Quarter woman points?  Yes to modesty and hijab, as enjoined by Allah, which is the means of self-protection.  Do me a favor, everyone watching, right?  Read down this list here, give yourself a point for every one of these that you are, and then in the next one, take off 50 points for every one of these that you are, and that will give you your, like, happy woman points.  I'm thinking I'll be on, like, what, minus 600?  No to wasting time in trivial pursuits and the love of revenge and futile arguments.  No to indulging in physical pleasure and giving in to every whim and desire.  No to wasting time with shallow people and spending hours in idle pursuits.  No to flan drinks, cigarettes, nargile, meaning hookah pipes apparently, I'm probably butchering that pronunciation, and all foul things.  No thinking of past calamities and dwelling on past mistakes.  That is actually quite a useful one, one that I should probably start following.  And that's basically just like the introduction.  The rest of the book is a series of short kind of like one to two page essays with lots of quotes from the Quran and stuff like that teaching you how to be the happiest woman in the world.  We're just gonna be reading a few fun bits today.  The Muslim woman in the Muslim land is a believing woman who gives charity, fasts, prays, observes hijab, obeys her husband, fears the Lord, is kind to her neighbors, and is compassionate towards her children.  What I find interesting there is that there's a lot of great things in that, you know, being kind to your kids, looking after your neighbours, giving to charity, and then in the middle it's like, obey your husband, fear the Lord.  It's like, calm down already.  The disbelieving woman in the lands of disbelief, ooh, this bit's about me, is a woman who makes a wanton display of herself.  She is ignorant and foolish, a mere fashion model.  Who am I?  A cheap and worthless product on offer in all places.  She has no value, honor, or religion.  Compare the two situations and you will see that you are happiest the most well off.  The next bit is super important if you don't want to look like a cheap fashion model like me.  You should take care of your appearance.  Wear perfume at home, keep your house tidy, and meet your husband, children, siblings, relatives, and friends looking cheerful with a ready smile and an attitude of contentment.  Never show your family how you really feel.  That's for losers.  Always pretend to be happy.  Plaster on that fake smile.  Maybe one day you'll convince yourself.  Beware of sin, for it leads to grief.  especially the sins that are very common among women, such as forbidden glances, wanton abandonment, being alone with a non-mahram man, cursing, slandering, backbiting, denying one's husband's rights.  Did the transformed wife write this?  There's a hell of a lot in common between her and Islam, isn't there?  She would probably kill me for saying that.  And not acknowledging your husband's acts of kindness.  These sins are very common among women, except for those on whom Allah has mercy.  So beware of incurring the wrath of Allah and fear him.  And this next bit is very important.  For fear of Allah is what brings happiness and a clear conscience.  That sentence right there sums up this entire book.  You wanna be happy, live your life in fear.  The next bit is actually surprising because I actually think it's really good advice.  Not so much the bit about repenting and stuff, but the bit about never giving up.  So, as horrible as some parts of this book are, there's actually a few little, you know, little silver linings here.  This is quite nice.  Be ambitious, keep climbing, and always have hope.  Always keep trying, and keep repenting.  If you go back to sin, then repent again.  Replace that with like, even if you fail, keep trying, keep, you know, improving, working on things, getting better.  It's actually pretty decent advice, you know?  The main thing is you should never feel defeated or frustrated because rationally speaking, there is no such thing as the last word or the bitter end.  Rather, there is always trial and error and learning from your mistakes.  I kind of love that.  So yeah, I guess even the worst things in the world can actually have like a little sliver of hope in there.  Ah, mate, this bit, pure poetry.  With your beauty, you are better than the sun.  With your morals, you are more sublime than Musk.  With your modesty, you are nobler than the full moon.  With your compassion, you are more beneficial than rain.  So preserve your beauty with faith, your tranquility with contentment, and your chastity with hijab.  Beware the life of bewitching, immoral, disbelieving women, for they are the fuel of the fire of hell.  Poetry.  The next part is really, really important because the thing is, it's okay to tell women these rules, but how do you know they're gonna follow them?  What if outside influencers, you know, tell them otherwise?  What if they watch a YouTube video like this?  What if they go out on the street and see that there are actually women out there who are happy being independent, being non-religious, following other religions maybe, doing their own thing, What if they find that out?  Well, there's a simple solution.  Keep your wife locked up at home.  Make her feel guilty if she leaves.  My dear sister, stay in your home except for serious and necessary matters.  For your home is the secret of your happiness.  You hear that?  Leave the house and you're sure to be unhappy and miserable.  It's a horrible world out there.  Why would you ever want to go when you can stay here?  alone in your home you will find a sense of happiness and you will protect your honor dignity and modesty.  for the insignificant woman is the one who goes to the market frequently for no reason and whose main concern is to watch trends and follow fashion going into stores and asking about every new thing.  so if you want to have a social life you'll be unhappy.  women are like stars in the sky.  The righteous Muslim woman is the one who treats her husband kindly and obeys him after obeying her Lord.  When the prophet, blessings and peace be upon him, was asked which woman is best, he said, the one who makes him her husband happy when he looks at her, who obeys him when he tells her to do something, and who does not oppose him in a manner that he dislikes with regard for herself or his will.  The prophet also said, shall I not tell you of something that is a man's treasure?  A righteous woman who pleases him when he looks at her.  When he tells her to do something, she obeys him.  And if he is away from her, she is faithful.  There you go.  You have no worth without a man telling you so.  And as such, a woman should welcome her husband warmly when he comes back to her.  She should not get upset if she finds him stressed and tired.  On the contrary, she should rush to fulfill his requests no matter what they are without asking him the reasons for his being stressed and tired as soon as he comes home.  Seriously, this could be written by the transformed wife or Debbie Pearl.  I'm pretty sure I've read very similar things in both their blogs and books and so on.  Thing is, a lot of this advice so far has been for women who are already married.  What about the newlyweds?  You gotta remember that in a lot of cases here, on the night of the wedding, you'll have to leave your home to go to a place you do not know, to a companion with whom you're unfamiliar.  By marrying you, he has become a master over you.  So be like a servant to him and he will become like a servant to  you.\".  Seriously, can we talk about how messed up it is to marry a man you barely even know?  Whether it's for religious reasons or because you're forced into it or for any other reason.  So messed up.  This should not be allowed.  But since it is and you wanna be happy, be content in his company.  and listen to and obey him.  Make sure that you smell good and look good.  He should not see anything ugly in you.  Prepare his food on time and be quiet when he is asleep.  Be careful, my daughter, of showing joy in front of him when he is upset and do not show sorrow in front of him when he is happy.  Basically, never have your own emotions, only your husband's.  The secret to happiness is never expressing how you're really feeling and always pretending to make your husband happy.  For all I joke, and for all I've been really silly so far in this video, this next bit is honestly the most disturbing thing in the entire book.  And I'm not going to mess around for this bit, because it's disgusting.  I'm just going to read it to you.  A woman who offered herself as a sacrifice and thus earned the pleasure of her lord.  It's exactly what it sounds like, and it's awful.  Have you heard of the Juhani woman who made a mistake and committed zina, fornication?  then she remembered allah and turned to him and repented she came pregnant as a result and said oh messenger of allah i have committed a sin that deserves a legal punishment.  so carry out the punishment on me.  the prophet called her guardian and said treat her kindly.  then when she gives birth come to me.  he did that.  then the prophet ordered that her clothes be tied tightly around her.  then he ordered that she be stoned.  then he offered the funeral prayer for her.  it was strong faith that motivated her to seek purification and choose the hereafter over this world.  If she had not had such strong faith, she would not have preferred death by stone.  Yeah.  So if you didn't get that, a woman had sex outside marriage.  She felt pregnant.  She felt guilty.  She said, hey, I've done this bad thing.  There's nothing I can do to make up for it.  And they said, yeah, we're going to torture and stone you to death.  That will make our God happy.  It's messed up and it's disgusting.  And this sort of thing should not be taught to anyone.  Anyway, to end this on a much lighter note, we're going to go back to some silliness for a while.  And we're going to be learning about chastity and modesty and how they enhance beauty.  Muslim women should be modest and chaste, pure and noble.  Their feet should not show.  Oh no, all those creepy people who messaged me saying to show feet are gonna get off on that.  Why do they do that?  Their feet should not show and their clothes should have long hand lines that drag along the ground behind them so that men will not see anything with them.  But don't worry, it doesn't just tell you how to be a good Muslim woman.  It criticises women like me.  But women nowadays raise their hemlines as much as they can for fear of getting them wet or dirty.  Because, oh no, who doesn't want dirty, stinking, muddy clothes in their home?  But they don't just do it for practical reasons.  They do it in imitation of the disbelieving women who appear virtually naked.  That's me, apparently.  Virtually naked right now.  Clearly a little bit more poetry for you.  Ah, beautiful.  I don't know why this isn't printed on t-shirts around the world.  Beautiful, listen to this.  But a woman was not created to interfere in the affairs of men.  Rather, we are flowers for smelling and embracing.  Why would we want to interfere in your affairs?  Oh yeah, smell and embrace me.  I'm gonna put that on a t-shirt.  The last parts we're gonna look at are a warning to stay away from women like me.  Beware of imitating, disbelieving, and immoral women or men.  That's me.  I'm immoral, apparently.  Beware of everything that angers the Lord, some of which are forbidden in Hadith, such as imitating men with my trousers.  Being alone with a non-Mahram man.  That's me.  I have male friends.  Travelling without a Mahram.  Ma-Mahram.  I can't pronounce these words, but I also do that.  Losing one's modesty.  Yeah, probably me.  Not dressing properly.  Also me.  Forgetting one's Lord.  Me?  Oh!  All of these are shameful deeds which cause distress in the heart and darkness in this world and in the hereafter.  It's okay, I'm happy with my little child-eating beast here.  Thank you for joining me today here in my very relaxed setting on my sofa with a very caffeinated beverage.  Spilling some tea about Islam.  Is that the right phrase?  Is that it?  Did I do it right?  Am I done with the kids now?  I'm too old for this.  But seriously, thank you for joining me and Kairi today.  I know she's been a little bit playful and loud and running around and very excited.  But it is a Sunday morning here, so, you know, you're having your fun, aren't you, Bean?  Here you are, hello!  Hopefully you enjoyed this video, and once again, if you're new here, it would be amazing if you subscribe and stick around.  I do atheism content, I do science-y stuff, little bits of history.  Always something for you to learn and have a giggle at, so, you know, should be a bit of fun.  And for everyone else, let me know what you thought of this video, let me know what you think of this book, let me know what you think about how Islam in general treats women, and the whole stoning to death thing.  ridiculous, right?  That's not just me.  And also, give me some channel feedback in general.  Once again, my growth has kind of, like, stagnated a little.  And I know a lot of people are saying, like, it's probably YouTube's algorithm screwing me over for taking my little break.  And I think it kind of is because my videos just aren't getting out there and, like, reaching that new audience.  But in all honesty, give me your brutal feedback.  Tell me what you think I can do better, what you want to see more of, what videos and topics you'd like me to cover in the future.  Give me some feedback down in the comments, please.  I appreciate you guys so much.  And I'm going to stop rambling now, but hopefully I will see you again soon.  Say bye, Kariba!  Close enough. ",
