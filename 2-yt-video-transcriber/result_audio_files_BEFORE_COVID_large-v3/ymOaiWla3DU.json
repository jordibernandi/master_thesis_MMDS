That lines from the FHA underwriting manual.  Racial covenants aren't just about discriminating against people of color.  It's about enriching white people.  And I think that's the part that often gets lost in this narrative.  And I think it does speak to the ways that white supremacy have been embedded in really built structures and built environments.

These were places to avoid.  So they're going to give you substandard housing and they're going to contain you.  Access to affordable housing was a challenge.  When you think about the reasons behind the creation of public housing, we had a lot of folks forced to the low-wage sector.  And you're thinking about what jobs or opportunities that low-income folks of color even had access to at this time.  I would argue that with the creation of public housing in 1938 with the Sumner Field Homes became this really interesting iteration of the redesign of space.  You have 400 units of public housing, which were segregated at the time, created.  In 1953, the City Council of Minneapolis refused to scatter another 1,000 units of public housing outside of the Sumner Field Homes area.  And where did these pressures come from?  You had both internal conservative politicians and outlying suburban communities coming in saying, not in my neighborhood.  And the City Council crumbled under the pressure and then took what was 400 units of public housing to over 1,000 units in less than a decade.  They have strategically manufactured urban poverty. ",

My grandparents were immigrants from Sweden who came to this country with nothing, worked incredibly hard jobs, but both sets of my grandparents in 1942 were able to buy houses in South Minneapolis.  These houses were in a part of the city that was blanketed by racial covenants.  Because of those racial covenants, my parents grew up in neighborhoods that were entirely white.  And in many ways, they described them as a paradise for children.  They had wonderful parks.  They had really solid schools that sent them to college.
