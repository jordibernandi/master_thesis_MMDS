            "text": "Before we begin today's video, I want to show you guys some footage.  It's really funny.  It's footage of women being asked to choose between their intelligence and their beauty.  Check it out.  Would you rather be dumb but drop-dead gorgeous or really intelligent but also ugly?  I don't know.  If you had to pick?  I don't know.  I think intelligence.  Intelligence but very ugly.  No, I don't know.  I would go for pretty and not intelligent because then you can learn things, I guess, and you can become smarter.  You can become more pretty, right?  Yeah.  That internal struggle is really funny.  It feels almost cruel to ask women how much importance they place on their appearance, on their looks.  Like where does appearance sit in their hierarchy of values?  Really, really interesting.  Remember their response is gonna be relevant to today's video.  So I was chatting yesterday with one of my patrons, a longtime supporter of the channel, and he asked me a really interesting question.  He was talking about how there's lots of YouTube channels like mine for men that are about self-improvement, how to become the best version of yourself, how to become a dynamic, interesting, intelligent individual.  They exist because there's a market for that.  There are thousands, hundreds of thousands of men across the globe who are seeking out this kind of content because they want to become the best version of themselves.  They want high self-esteem.  They want to be the kind of man who is attractive to women.  Now with men all putting in this effort, what he wanted to know is, is there a female equivalent to this kind of channel?  Are there hundreds of YouTube channels out there telling women how to shape their personalities, how to become the best versions of themselves so that they can attract a man?  There may be a couple, but largely the answer is no.  And he wanted to know why.  I told him that there are female equivalent channels that achieve the same purpose as channels like this, but that they look very, very different.  If you think of a YouTube channel for men that is designed to help men improve their personalities so that they can attract women, the closest female equivalent that I can think of is a beauty channel, a channel that gives fashion tips, makeup advice, exercise routines.  When I told him that the female equivalent of a male self-improvement channel is a female beauty channel, I think he was quite shocked.  We both had a bit of a laugh about it, but I can understand why that answer stings a bit.  Young men have to work so hard on themselves to become... successful to become well-rounded dynamic interesting individuals.  they go through all of this effort but the female equivalent is putting on a nice dress putting on some makeup looking pretty.  is that it?  it doesn't seem fair does it?  but let me remind you biology is not fair.  Males and females within a species are not designed to do the same thing.  Consider a male lion.  He's so big and muscular, and that's great for fighting off other male lions and protecting the herd, but it's not going to be good for hunting.  He can't sneak up on prey.  So men and women in the lion society both have their own separate but equal roles.  There's no equality between males and females in the animal kingdom, and that's the point.  Men and women are different.  Now, some people look at the fact that women obsess about beauty tips and fashion and all of this stuff, and they conclude that women are superficial and shallow.  Men are out there studying history, ethics, politics, whereas women are reading fashion magazines about the latest designer trends.  They see that and they settle for the very simplistic explanation that men are more sophisticated, men are more complex, women are more simple.  But no, no, no, that is not how it works.  Alright, we need to zoom out a little bit.  When we talk about evolutionary psychology, there are two different types of evolutionary pressures that mould us to become who we are.  One is natural selection and the other is sexual selection.  Natural selection is our ability to survive and adapt to our physical surroundings.  We evolve to suit our environment, whether that's using tools to start fires, build shelters, to hunt animals.  We learn to think strategically.  Natural selection is undoubtedly an extremely important force that shapes our evolution.  Less understood is sexual selection, because that doesn't have anything to do with trying to survive in the physical environment.  It has to do with evolving so that you appeal to the opposite gender, so that you can reproduce and pass on your genes.  The obvious example that we go to is the male peacock tail, because that serves no obvious evolutionary advantage from a survival point of view.  That thing is a huge liability and makes you a lot more vulnerable to predators.  Why would a male peacock evolve to have that kind of tail?  Well, it's because it's got nothing to do with physical survival.  It's got to do with sexual survival.  He shows it off as an attempt to try and get the female peacocks to mate with him.  It is sexual selection that has crafted the peacock tail.  For a highly social animal like human beings, sexual selection has had a far bigger impact on our psychology than natural selection.  In other words, the majority of the traits that men and women have weren't evolved to help them survive in the physical world and adapt to dangers in the physical environment.  they were developed to adapt us to the social environment to help us attract a mate.  in layman's terms it all comes down to sex.  we just want to pass on our genes.  that's it.  so why did men evolve?  to be ambitious analytical, achievement-driven, capable of being a strong provider.  It's because of sexual selection.  It's because that's what women wanted from men.  Women wanted men who were intelligent enough to be able to predict danger and then successfully evade that danger.  They wanted men who were strong enough to overcome challenges men who were ambitious enough to reach the highest status in human society because then they could provide for their children.  so over time sexual selection exerts its influence.  men who have those highly ambitious traits they begin to mate more and then it creates a self-reinforcing cycle.  it's a feedback loop.  men start developing these traits because they notice that it is attractive to women.  men who have those traits are the ones that get to pass on their genes.  it is a type of selective breeding, except that nobody is in charge.  Nobody's in control of this whole thing.  It's just evolution.  Everybody is just adapting individually to what suits their specific needs, but it has an impact on the species as a whole.  You know, those really soft feminine guys who call themselves the male feminists, the guys who despise their own masculinity.  The reason they're doing that is because they think it's going to appeal to women.  They think that it's going to get them sex.  That is the motivation.  It's not going to work because women aren't attracted to those kinds of men, but that's what they think.  The point is that men act the way that women want them to act.  They develop the characteristics that women find sexually desirable.  If women genuinely preferred soft, feminine men and refused to have sex or mate with any masculine men, you would find male behavior change very, very quickly.  Everybody would be scrambling to accommodate this new preference.  This is how evolution works.  Each gender dictates how the other gender should behave.  And so over long-term evolution, when you see men have characteristics of strength and confidence and ambition, that's because women found it sexually desirable.  That's what caused it.  Now in the next part of the video, I'm going to flip it and explain why women focus on what they focus on.  What were the evolutionary pressures that made them give so much thought to their appearance?  But before we do that, I want to tell you about my adults only bonus content.  This topic is about women who are ashamed of their manners and won't let boys go down on them.  I talk about why women have this shame of their vaginas, and I talk about the male equivalent of men who are ashamed of their dicks.  I talk about the reasons why men might not enjoy giving a woman cunt ass.  Lastly, I talk about how you can help to solve your partner's insecurity about her vagina, and why it's ultimately in your best interest to have a woman who's not ashamed of her genitals.  I love talking about sex, and this is the kind of topic that I can't cover on YouTube, because this sort of topic using these kinds of words they get me demonetized.  so if you want to access my more explicit stuff go ahead and sign up at my patreon.  it's just five dollars a month and you get access to everything okay.  so if all of these male self-improvement channels are proof that women want men who are ambitious successful intelligent dynamic all that stuff.  what do the plethora of female beauty channels say about male preferences?  it says that men are interested in looks.  that's the reason why women pay so much attention to appearance fashion all of that stuff.  it's because of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution and sexual selection have demonstrated time and time again to women that that's what men care about.  so that's what they should focus on.  is she young healthy attractive?  That's what men want to know.  Fundamentally, it's about her ability to have healthy children.  He wants to know if she is fertile, if she has good genes.  So really, there is nothing superficial or shallow about any of this.  I mean, those are concepts just created by the human mind.  They don't really exist in reality.  Reality is just biology, and that's what's occurring here.  So if you think that men are superior to women because women spend all of their time focused on appearances and looks, then you have gravely missed the point.  They are just responding to what men are interested in.  In actual fact, it's a bigger indictment of men.  It's also one of the reasons why I am so grateful that I was born a man and not a woman.  I can only imagine how frustrating it must be to be a woman who is intelligent and accomplished and yet when you're in the dating market all men seem to care about is what you look like.  I would find that unbearable.  My sympathy to all of the amazing women out there who have awesome personalities but aren't very pretty and you don't get the attention that you deserve.  That sucks.  So if you're frustrated that women seem to be really superficial and only care about looks, The solution, at least on a society wide level, is that we need to stop paying attention to beautiful women.  We need to stop giving them validation just for their looks.  We need to raise our standards collectively.  We need to demand more.  Don't give away your attention or your commitment to a woman just because she's pretty.  Wait to see if she has more.  Wait to see what her personality is like.  Check to see if she's actually a high quality woman.  If every single man on this planet collectively raised his standards of what he expects from a woman in terms of personality, you would see women respond very quickly to this new market pressure.  They would abandon all the fashion magazines and start reading philosophy instead.  But that's not going to happen.  You and I know that that's not going to happen because on an individual level, you and I can raise our standards, but we're just a drop in the ocean.  It's just such a small, small force.  The world's most abundant resource is thirsty men.  And there's always going to be guys who are willing to do something just for a pretty face.  I'm afraid that's not going to change.  No passionate speeches from me are going to have any real impact.  It's just too deeply rooted in our biology.  So I encourage you to drop all the ideas that you have about equality or superiority, which gender is more superficial.  That's all complete nonsense.  Men are the way that they are because of women's preferences.  Women are the way that they are because of men's preferences.  They are inextricably entwined and no amount of complaining is ever going to change that.  There are biological facts that dictate how we behave.  And the sooner we understand and accept these facts, the sooner we can begin to make changes within the system to suit our advantage.
