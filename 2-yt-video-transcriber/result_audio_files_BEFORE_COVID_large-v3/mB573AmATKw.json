And that, I have it right here, it's actually a medical condition called ovotesticular disorder.  And there are also other genetic disorders where people are born with XXY, XY, or just X or just Y and such.  And while it may seem rare, there are hundreds of thousands of people born with this each year.  And so going off of your fairytale hybrid people, they do exist.  And so I'm just wondering how that would play into your view of there being a spectrum of gender because... ",

            "text": "No.  If such a person existed, I would not include that part in my next speech.  Such a person does not exist.  Now, intersex and the genetic deformities you're talking about obviously do exist.  And I expected someone to bring that up in the Q&A.  I think it's a fine point to bring up.  Two things I would say to that.  Number one, that actually has nothing to do with transgenderism.  Because when we talk about transgender, we're talking specifically about intersex people.  Then we would just say intersex.  But with transgender, most of the time, we're talking about men who don't have any deformity.  They are just straight-up men, clearly.  And they are identifying as a woman.  So even if I agreed that what you're talking about is some sort of exception, that actually would have nothing to do with the transgender topic.  But I don't think it is an exception because, as I said, I think a true... middle, you know, a true resident of the middle circle of the Venn diagram would be someone who has the reproductive capabilities of both genders.  And no one like that exists.  I mean, to be, not to be crude, but there isn't anyone who can get themselves pregnant, right?  And that doesn't exist in the human kingdom anyway.  So I don't think, I think what you're talking about.  there are people who have deformities.  And so in their case, it would be more difficult than usual to determine what their actual biological sex is because the usual indicators aren't there or aren't as obvious, but that doesn't mean that they don't have a biological sex.  It's just not as clear. ",
