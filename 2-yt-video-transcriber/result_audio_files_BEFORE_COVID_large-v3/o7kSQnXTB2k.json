            "text": "Thank you.  Hey guys, welcome back to the show.  Today we're gonna be talking about the strange relationship between body positivity and Photoshop.  And this whole story revolves around a woman named Tess Holliday.  I'm sure most of you guys already know who she is, but for anyone who doesn't, Tess Holliday is a plus-sized model.  And unlike other plus-sized models like Ashley Graham, for instance, who really isn't even that plus-sized, I mean, she's not that far off from your average person's weight, Tess Holliday, on the other hand, is a bit more... more.  It's been reported that she weighs 300 pounds, which is around a UK size 26, and I'm not even sure how to conceptualize how big that would be in person, but there you go.  She big girl.  Aside from her modeling work, she's probably best known for promoting the F Your Beauty Standards movement, which aims to increase the amount of diverse representation in industries like modeling, beauty, fashion, and just media in general.  It's all about hashtag self-love and body positivity and appreciate your body for what it is, that kind of thing.  As one fawning write-up about the movement in the Huffington Post read, Holliday made headlines when she was signed by Milk Model Management as the largest woman on their books, proving wrong critics who said she was too large to model.  She wants to continue to help other women to feel confident in their bodies, regardless of their size or what society tells them is beautiful.  That article was written in 2015, and since then, Tess Holliday's popularity has really blown up.  so to speak.  She's been featured on magazine covers like People and Cosmo as well, and she also has almost 2 million followers on her personal Instagram account.  As popular as she is though, Tess Holliday has always been somewhat of a controversial figure, and actually following the release of her Cosmo cover, a whole new wave of criticisms started pouring in.

Since the beginning of her career as a plus-size model, she's had to fend off degrading comments about her weight, her health, and her validity as a woman.  But Tess's appearance on the cover of the UK Cosmopolitan magazine brought out responses that took the hate to a whole other level. ",

We shouldn't be bullying anyone for any reason.  Bullying is mean.  Don't bully people, kids.  But still, weighing as much as she does, I think it is safe to say that yes, Tess Holliday does get a lot of hate for it.  However, I do think it's a bit dishonest of her to try and brush off all the criticism she gets as just people hating fat people, because there's more to it than that.  Yes, some of the negativity she gets is just trolls calling her names, but a lot of the people who don't support her don't because they're genuinely concerned that she's promoting an unhealthy lifestyle.  To which I know some of her fans usually say, oh, so merely by existing now a fat person is apparently promoting an unhealthy lifestyle?  No.  I mean, barring certain medical conditions, it is true that fat people probably do have unhealthy lifestyles themselves, as do a lot of us.  It's not just fat people who could take steps to improve their well-being.  But still, just because someone has an unhealthy lifestyle, that doesn't mean they're promoting it.  A smoker can smoke by himself and not promote smoking, and likewise, an overweight person can just live their life as an overweight person and not promote being overweight.  But the thing is, Tess Holliday isn't just some random overweight person living an unhealthy lifestyle.  She literally does promote her unhealthy lifestyle. ",

She's a morbidly obese person that appears on TV interviews and in magazines talking specifically about how society is too stigmatizing of her morbid obesity.  Would we allow a meth head to try to do the same thing to normalize their lifestyle?  To convince us that, oh, you can still be beautiful with pockmarks and hollow cheeks?  Of course not.  Would we allow an anorexic person to do the same thing?  To appear on the cover of Cosmo magazine looking essentially like a skeleton to tell us that there need to be more people with their collarbones and rib cages sticking out in commercials.  because inclusivity?  No.  You know the answer is no, and I think the only reason why it's okay with obesity is because being overweight has become so widespread in the West, especially the US, incidentally, where Holiday is from.  And what makes matters worse, in my opinion, is that Tess Holiday is also one of those people that tries to push the idea that being overweight is not unhealthy.  There's a concern that the bigger you are, the less healthy you are likely to be. ",

            "text": "It would be one thing if Tess Holliday was using her platform to say, hey, if you're overweight, you don't need to hate your body.  But part of loving yourself is trying to lead a healthy lifestyle.  Instead, she's saying, it's great being overweight.  I'm so beautiful.  Health concerns?  No, no health concerns.  What you talking about?  It's one thing if someone is overweight and they're aware of the possible health complications that could come with it.  And that's just an informed decision that they've made to be okay with that.  It's another thing if someone is overweight and they want to be healthy, but they're under the impression that they are healthy because you've told them that they are healthy.  Kind of went on a bit of a tangent there, but that is the 411 on Tess Holliday.  What this video is about though isn't something that's necessarily new, it's just I'm only now finding out about it, is that Tess Holliday, body positivity, self-love, media-critical Tess Holliday, Apparently, Photoshop's her images.  And I know that may sound like a strange thing to pick on her for, because whether we like it or not, the truth is that between Instagram models and brands, commercials, Photoshop is everywhere.  Personally, I have pretty mixed feelings about the whole Photoshop thing.  Is it the end of the world if an ad campaign or an Instagram model airbrushes someone's skin to look a little smoother?  I don't think so, no.  But if we ever get to a place, and frankly I think we already may have, where every single image we see of someone on a screen has been digitally altered to look perfect to the point where we're not even used to seeing what regular people look like, then I would say that's a problem.  Yeah.  In 2019, what a lot of the body positivity movement talks about isn't just, hey, love yourself and love your body.  It's, hey, let's examine why so many people are insecure to begin with.  And even though I've been pretty dang critical of a lot of the body positivity movement, especially with what they do with weight, I honestly don't think that talking about how widespread Photoshop is in our society is a bad thing.  And this is where Tess Holliday comes into conflict with some people in the body positivity movement who would otherwise have her back.  The professional shots that Tess Holliday releases are photoshopped and airbrushed.  It looks as if her cellulite and stretch marks have been removed, fat rolls and double chins seem a lot less prominent, and in general she does just look smaller than she does in her candid shots.  To be fair to Holiday though, she has openly addressed her use of Photoshop.  On Instagram, she wrote that, quote, this is my body with very minimal Photoshop, but make no mistake that I think Photoshop is an essential part of my industry.  When I first started modeling, I wasn't as comfortable with my arms or tummy, but now I love all of it.  Most of the images you see daily in the media, magazines, etc.  have been photoshopped and you would have no idea.  I don't believe in using it to distort someone's body or make them slimmer, but to smooth lines in clothes or amping up the colors, yes.  Have any of you ever used a filter on Instagram?  Gasp!  That's the same thing.  As a model, I have zero control over how a photo is edited or the final result, but work with the best in the industry and stand by my work.  So yes, you can F your beauty standards by using Photoshop, makeup, and a wind machine.  It is true that usually models don't have control over the final product of a photo shoot, and I really doubt that anyone out there would have a problem with Photoshop being used to brighten colors or smooth out clothes.  But Holiday did say that she doesn't approve of Photoshop being used to really alter people's bodies, but it does seem like that is exactly what's happening to her photos, whether she's the one doing it or not.  Like I said, Photoshop really is everywhere nowadays, but I do understand why people are criticizing Tess Holiday specifically for using it.  If you make your whole shtick about self-love and F your beauty standards and media portrayals need to be more realistic, but then you use Photoshop to achieve the same airbrushed fantasy results that we see in magazines now, it's not really F your beauty standards, it's more like F some of your beauty standards, I'm gonna try to uphold other ones even though they are literally unrealistic in that they're not real.  I'm sorry, but if your whole thing is that fat is beautiful, you can't escape the fact that stretch marks and cellulite are a thing when you're 300 pounds.  Even skinny people have stretch marks and cellulite.  I know Tess Holliday isn't the one photoshopping these images herself, but still, she's a big enough name now where I'm sure if she wanted to, she could exert at least some influence over what her photos look like.  Between photoshopping fat rolls and cellulite and downplaying if not outright dismissing health concerns, it's almost like Tess Holliday is airbrushing the negative aspects of being fat.  It's like she presents a smooth, smiling, according to herself, healthy image on Instagram, but that's not what the reality of morbid obesity looks like.  The reality is fat rolls, fat dimples, cellulite, diabetes, heart disease.  And Holiday's stance on photoshopping appeared even more questionable after an app used to slim down pictures used a photo of her in an ad without her permission.  About the incident, she wrote on Instagram, quote, an app that has nearly 50,000 downloads was dumb enough to steal photos of myself and two other plus-size women and use them for this nonsense.  I'm sharing this because I want to address a few things.  First of all, the fact that anyone thinks it's okay to market this to anyone is appalling.  But like, come on, y'all.  She then condemned the app for using her image without her permission or without compensating her.  And finished by saying, lastly, never let anyone make you feel like you need to alter your appearance or who you are.  You are enough.  You are worthy of love in your current body, whatever that body looks like.  Obviously, using someone's photo in your ad without their permission is a crappy thing to do.  But at the same time, what does that statement mean for Tess Holliday's opinions on Photoshop?  First, she said she used it, but only a little bit, but then it looked like her photos were using it a lot, and now it seems as if she hates what this app does.  If Tess Holliday can Photoshop her stretch marks, cellulite, and fat rolls, Who is she to tell another woman that she shouldn't be photoshopping herself to look slimmer?  Which Tess Holliday arguably does as well, by the way.  Again, we're giving the middle finger to some beauty standards, but we're embracing others.  It's almost like she wants other women to look fat, but wants to be able to look as good as possible in her own photos.  I honestly think that Tess Holliday does actually have a very pretty face, but when it comes to Photoshop, I feel like she's trying to have her cake and eat it too.  I think it's pretty hard to promote body positivity when you're airbrushing the crap out of your body, but as always, I would love to know what you guys think.  How do you feel about the body positivity movement and how do you feel about the prominence of Photoshop?  Plus, do you think there's any connection between these two things?  Let me know, but that's it for now.  Thank you guys so much for tuning in and I'll see you next time. ",
