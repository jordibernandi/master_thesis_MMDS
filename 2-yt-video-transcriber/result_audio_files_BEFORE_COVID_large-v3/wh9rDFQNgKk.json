It's an awful, terrible story.  A 16-year-old Brighton High School student, it began, has been charged with slashing a 14-year-old girl's face with a razor blade in Dorchester Park, leaving a gash that required more than 100 stitches to close.  The story was on the front page of the Metro section, along with a large photograph of the 14-year-old.  Her face is now disfigured by an angry red scar stretching from her forehead to her lip.  She said she and some of her friends had been challenged to a fight by another group of girls and had been told that if they didn't show up, the other girls would find them and beat them on the street.  I made a point of showing you that story so we could talk about it.  Such violence and intimidation are far removed from anything you've ever experienced, Caleb.  But you're no longer too young to know that many other children are not so fortunate, including some in your own backyard.  When we talked about that news story, I told you that safety is one of the reasons.  Mama and I send you to the Hebrew Academy instead of public school.  You've never seen a fistfight, never mind a gang brawl with razor blades.  When you first read the story, you weren't even sure what a razor blade was.  Oh my god!  This is so good.  Here's the kick.  So he describes this, like, you know, violent razor slashing in some shitty neighborhood in Boston.  And he said, I wanted to talk to you about this, Caleb, and discuss this news article with you.  Here's the kicker.  He says, now, as a nine-year-old... ",
