Right, so everyone was saying it was an endorsement, but it was basically like, I like the guy, he's been consistent over the years, something like that.

I would still say Dave Rubin, who is a popular podcaster, said blah, blah, blah, right?  That's an accurate framing.

Joe Rogan, comma, who has a history of making homophobic and racist jokes, comma, if you had to describe Joe Rogan, look at his Wikipedia, that's not what he's known as.  MMA, comedian, podcaster, No one would define him that way unless you are telling and training your audience what to think.  It's completely disingenuous and that's the difference between having a bias and having an agenda.  If it was a bias, they said Joe Rogan, popular cat cast, however, he's gotten controversy for this, you show both sides.  That's not what they're doing.  They're telling you front and center, this person is the enemy and you should shun him.  And what's beautiful is, Look who the corporate press has needlessly alienated through their chicanery.  Rogan fans, Tulsi fans, Bernie fans, Andrew Yang fans, Trump fans, Kobe fans, Don Imus fans.  It's amazing.
