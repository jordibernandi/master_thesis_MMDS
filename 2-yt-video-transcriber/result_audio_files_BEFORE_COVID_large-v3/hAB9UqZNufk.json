The government of Sacramento has made that virtually illegal citywide.  Hi, everyone.  I'm Gardner Goldsmith for MRCTV.  You know, in the fantastic 1985 film Brazil, director Terry Gilliam brought us a dystopian world that was so absurd, the main character couldn't even fix his own air conditioning unit that was out of whack at his place and basically steaming him to death.  He had to call in the black market repairman to do the job.  Harry Tuttle, heating engineer at your service.  Well, it looks like the commissars of Sacramento, California actually like the idea of telling people what they can and can't fix on their own property. ",

            "text": "Because as Matt Agares reports for the Free Thought Project, in the land of the free, every day, local governments and municipalities trample the rights of citizens to do with their own property what they wish.  Over the years, we've seen people face jail time for the length of their grass, arrested for windmills, and even ticketed for growing food.  Now we've discovered a law in Sacramento, California, that makes it illegal to repair a vehicle in your own garage.  Yep.  Sacramento's zoning code shows how little Leviathan, the government that can be oppressive on the local level, is telling people how to live, even as it tries to push business towards the established auto repairmen.  Now, Agrist explains that on the surface, the commissars appear to allow minor vehicle repair.  Of course, they magnanimously allow the plebes to work on what?  brake part replacement, minor tune-ups, oil changes and oil filters, repair of flat tires, lubrication, and other similar operations.  But the fact that anyone in government is issuing diktats about what people can do to their own property on their own property is the ethical stopping point here.  On principle, the details really are irrelevant.  But let's look into the details and see just how absurd this is and how the details actually make it virtually impossible for anyone to really work on his own car on his own property.  Agares writes that the code enforcement rules say that it's unlawful for any person to engage in or permit others to engage in minor vehicle repair or maintenance in any agricultural, agricultural residential, residential, interim estate, and interim residential zones under any of the following circumstances.  One, using tools not normally found in a residence.  Two, conducted on vehicles registered to persons not currently residing on the lot or parcel.  Three, conducted outside a fully enclosed garage and resulting in any vehicle being inoperable for a period in excess of 24 hours.  So what's a tool normally found in a residence?  Is this resident's house an apartment?  And given the fact that citizens of Sacramento can't legally work on vehicles that aren't registered to folks on the parcel where the work is being conducted, that means that Friends can't help Friends repair vehicles.  In fact, it means that individual owners can't work on their own cars if the cars aren't registered.  And if you don't own a closeable garage, I'm sorry, no soup for you.  It's just amazing.  You know, the argument that the city fathers of the commissariat of Sacramento give is that working on your own cars could discharge pollutants into the water system.  And that's why they have to clamp down and make sure that nobody can do anything in their own garages, essentially.  But of course, people use all sorts of chemicals on their own lawns.  And there's an easier way to get around this rather than telling everybody else how to live.  The problem, at least based on what their argument is, is that there's a public water supply.  If you actually got inventive, sacramental fathers, you'd realize that if you allowed for a private property paradigm, then people would be incentivized to make sure that they didn't pollute their neighbor's property by polluting the water.  I know, it's just a crazy free market idea.  You know, when I saw Brazil in 1985, I thought, well, this is a very creative way to see the future.  I didn't quite think that we would get there.  But it seems that the folks behind the government of Sacramento are eager to do so.  Yes, indeed.  Dystopia.  is here.  you don't have to watch movies anymore.  hey thanks so much for watching.  don't forget to like and subscribe.  and thank you so much also for all the great comments about the videos.  i really enjoy being able to be in touch with kindred spirits for mrctv.  i'm gardner goldsmith.
