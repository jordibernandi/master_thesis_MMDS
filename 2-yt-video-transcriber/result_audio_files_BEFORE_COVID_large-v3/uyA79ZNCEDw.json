            "text": "This is what I believe.  For sexual health and pregnancy, all options should be available, and we should be educated about them.  I believe our schools should teach an evidence-based education, uncolored by religious beliefs.  I believe our military should respect and include all our soldiers, religious and secular.  And I am a Christian spiritualist American.  And I am a Jewish American.  And we're agnostic Americans.  I believe that we should welcome religious and secular political candidates.  I believe we should each choose how we face the end of our lives without the religious beliefs of others interfering.  And I'm an agnostic American.  A spiritual American.  I believe having lower health standards, religious day cares, and faith healing endangers the lives of all of our children.  I believe our tax dollars should only fund institutions that do not discriminate on the basis of religion.  And I'm an atheist American.  An agnostic Buddhist American.  I believe our environmental policy should be based on scientific evidence.  I believe doctors should look beyond religious views to best address the needs of their patients.  I believe we should encourage and use scientific advancement without any limitation from religion.  And I'm a Muslim American.  A secular Jewish American.  An atheist American.  I believe adults of all sexual orientations should have the same rights and privileges, and I'm a secular humanist American.  I believe many Americans share our views but remain silent.  Do you believe in a secular America? ",
