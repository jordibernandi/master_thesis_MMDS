Proudly brought to you by BuzzFeed's less well-known cousin, but no less awful, BBC Sesh.  I posted an article about this exact topic about a month ago, thinking that it was just something that overweight feminists scream about, because what don't they scream about?  But apparently, it's actually a thing.  And obviously, having thin privilege myself, I'm obviously very well equipped to discuss this topic.  So let's jump in.  Before I actually show you guys this video, I just want to qualify what thin privilege apparently is, although I'm sure you can guess.  The thin in Thin Privilege is not about being supermodel skinny, but being at a weight.  that means you are not subjected to judgment and harassment from strangers.  It means that you can go into almost any clothes store and find something that will fit.  You can eat a hamburger in public without people clearly judging your decision.  You can wear something figure-hugging without people sniggering at you.  What even is going on?  I guess that's just a few examples of what it's like to be healthy.  With that in mind, let's roll the video. ",

And I would say that your average passenger is probably resentful of that.  In the same way that they're resentful of the idiot sitting at the back of the carriage playing music from their phone without headphones in.  Or the person who is talking really, really loudly on their phone.  Stop that.  Especially on super crowded trains and trams and buses, it's pretty understandable how someone might get bent out of shape because you're encroaching upon their space.

This goes on your skin tone.  Somebody throw Shamu back in the ocean.  I'm just not really seeing the thin privilege in any of this because, um, basically every woman I know who goes shopping hates shopping because they can't find anything that fits them.  This is not a skinny or overweight thing, this is a. the clothing industry doesn't make clothes for human beings thing.  Can I find pants that don't smash me in the ankle?  No.  Can I find dresses that don't fly up and show everyone my butt when I walk places?  No.  This may come as a shock to you, my friend, but you're not special.  This is not a thin privilege thing.  Let me just make that abundantly clear to you as a skinny person.  It's very, very, very hard to find clothes.  The end.  I know this from experience because when I was doing my undergraduate degree, because I didn't want to be poor, I worked in fashion retail.  And let me tell you now, for a fact, 90% of women would walk out of the fitting room feeling depressed no matter what body shape they had.  Because clothing shopping is depressing.  Squeeze those cheeks, sister!

I would say that the bulk of people probably don't notice when someone else is like smashing down a burger or some sort of tasty delicious treat, because the bulk of people don't actually care about what you're doing in public.  But it's not the fault of thin privilege that people might sit there and stare or make comments when you're sitting there chowing down on something.  that is probably the definition of cholesterol in a circle shape.  In the event that someone is actually giving you a dirty look because you're shoveling a donut into your mouth, it's more than likely because they're looking at you thinking, hmm, eating that kind of food is why that person is overweight.

The other side of this that people don't seem to realize is that when you are a skinny person who's eating a hamburger, people feel a need to, like, high-five you for getting some nutrition in you.

No one can definitively diagnose you just by looking at you.  I acknowledge that.  If we could, we could probably get a lot of liberals into psychiatric care.  However, it's pretty common knowledge that if you are overweight, you will be more at risk of particular serious health problems than someone who is thinner.  You will run the risk of having type 2 diabetes, liver issues, heart issues, kidney issues, and so on and so forth.  Just to throw this in there as well, 87% of people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.  What fun!  All that thin privilege just protects me from having serious, serious disease.  So yeah, it's not a thin privilege thing, it's that people get a pretty fair idea of the health issues that you might potentially have based on looking at you.
