            "text": "The Jesus that you read about in the New Testament is alive and in the world and working right now.  We couldn't even be here, new creatures, having been Negroes yesterday.  mentally dead yesterday.  But our eyes are open, our ears are open, our tongue is free, our heart is clear.  We are standing on a new idea now because we have met with the Jesus.  We are being healed of the work of Satan, the Caucasian, and his world.  Huh?  Yes, sir.  Beautiful.  So when we say our prayer, our sacrifice, our life, and our death is all for Allah, the Lord of the worlds, we see one straight line from the originator to the manifestation of his will in Master Farhad Muhammad.  You may say we are guilty of shirk or we are kafir or unbeliever.  Call us what you want.  Nobody on earth has the power to deal with the condition of black people but master Farad Muhammad and his servant the honorable Elijah Muhammad.  Nobody.  There is no form of Islam other than the teachings of the honorable Elijah Muhammad that can resurrect and awaken black people all over the world.  So we cannot take Master Farad Muhammad and hide him under a bushel basket.  We can't deny him who gave us life.  My prayer, my sacrifice, My life and my death is all for Master Farad Muhammad.  For he today is the Lord of the worlds.  He's a human being.  But in him is the power to bring about a new world order and remove an old world order.  The Muslim world is looking for the Mahdi or the Mahadaya.  Mahdi or Mahadaya is a self-guided one who comes to guide others.  When we say, oh Allah, guide us on the right path, Well, it's clear when you make a prayer like that, that you know you're off the right path.  If the world is in the condition that it is in, it's evident that the world is off the right path.  We need a guide to guide us back to the right path.  Master Farad Muhammad came to North America by himself to guide a lost people back to the right path.  Personally, I thank him for his coming.  I would never have met the honorable Elijah Muhammad had not he come.  The honorable Elijah Muhammad would have still been Elijah Poole, maybe somewhere drunk, if he had not met Master Farad Muhammad.  He had all of this potential, but he had only gone to the fourth grade of school, so he couldn't lead us.  not in the condition that he was in.  But when he met Master Farad Muhammad and studied under him three years and approximately four months, he had enough learning in that three years and four months to turn the world of the Caucasian upside down.  It was Master Farad Muhammad who made Elijah Muhammad.  It was Elijah Muhammad who made Malcolm.  It was Elijah Muhammad who made Wallace Dee.  It was Elijah Muhammad who made Louis Farrakhan.  It is Elijah Muhammad making all of us who are shining out today.  We can't take any credit for who we are.  we have to give the credit where it rightfully belongs.  Well then, if a man has done so much for us, then my desire and your desire should be to help him do the job that God put on him.  Master Farad Muhammad said to the honorable Elijah Muhammad, according to what the honorable Elijah Muhammad said to us, he said, brother, you have the hardest job of any man who ever lived.  I mean, just think about that.  There's been a lot of men who worked mighty works since this earth has been in existence.  And yet the best knower said that Elijah Muhammad had the hardest job of any man that ever lived because he had the job of raising a dead nation and taking us from nothing and making a new people and then a new world out of a people who had been made into nothing.  with the most powerful enemy in the last 6,000 years as his opponent.  That's a pretty rough job.  Then Elijah Muhammad set about to get helpers.  And Malcolm was one of his great helpers.  But a helper Malcolm didn't know anything about how to wake you up.  Malcolm didn't know anything about an ex.  Until he met a man taking names.  And that man took the name Little and gave him an ex.  Thus Malcolm X was born.  Remember that, brothers.  Remember that, sisters.  Elijah Muhammad was taking away slave names, which some of you still have.  So it's good that you wear the X cap.  It's better that you get the real X. The honorable Elijah Muhammad was looking for help with this hard job.  When a man got a job and he's looking for help, you can't come to that man and tell him how to do his job.  You met him already on the job, so that man has to tell you how to help him.  If you meet me and I got this rostrum and I'm picking it up, don't tell me to put it back down.  you show me how to pick it up better.  I got it up.  grab a corner of it.  make it easier for me but let me tell you what corner to grab since I'm the one that know where the strain is.  Malcolm didn't teach Elijah Muhammad.  When Malcolm met Elijah Muhammad, Elijah Muhammad had black folk awakening.  He needed a good helper.  And Malcolm was an excellent vehicle, an excellent helper.  The enemy is always trying to take good help away from a good man.  Have you noticed in every country on earth, particularly the third world countries, when we produce brilliant men and women, foreign governments come and suck them right up, take them out of their country, promise them all kind of perks and wealth?  It's called brain drain.  All our brilliant black brothers and sisters, they're not working for you.  Our brilliant brothers and sisters are sitting over in corporate America.  because they make use of our brains, but they don't use our brains for our liberation, our development, our betterment.  They use the power of our minds to keep a world going that denies us justice.  Elijah Muhammad wanted help to produce a world of our own. ",
