            "text": "hi hello everybody welcome to this new video.  my name is adam and today i'm going to be talking about rejection because you are trans.  i'm not going to talk about rejection when you are trans but because of it makes a big difference.  so the type of rejections that i have personally dealt with and tried to categorize them into these it could be physical.  i have had people that rejected me you know because of my body parts and back in the days being pretty um newly coming out and everything.  It would have triggered me.  and it did trigger me so much and it triggered my dysphoria crazily.  Probably cried, whatever.  But now I feel like things changed, that I moved forward, I'm to progress to be put in that position again.  For so many reasons, now if somebody comes off like that, I just feel at peace because I don't want to be around someone that would just tolerate my body parts.  I want them to be genuinely attracted to it.  And if they're not, they're not.  Somebody else will and they might be even cuter, even better, even smarter.  And I have had trans people asking me, you know, the ones that are still new in their transition as well, asking me, I'm scared to transition and I'm scared to just accept being trans because I'm scared I'm not going to be loved ever.  And that is just heartbreaking to me.  And that is not true.  You will.  And the second type of rejection I think hurts me more now which is the social one.  you know when you find a girl that really cares for you and really loves you but she's not that girl.  you know she's not the type of girl that would stand up for you no matter what.  she's very influenced by society because i mean depending on the girl's family it could be actually somehow i'm not gonna say brave but Like she would come out of her way to date me as a trans person.  Just a short story, I'm not gonna get into details with this.  I had a girl that I really liked since I was a kid and she didn't like me ever because we grew up very close.  She was one of the few people that I have met Since I was a kid and still kept contact with still came out to but still was there But she was not quite that type.  She was very influenced by society.  She was so scared scared of her parents scared of everybody and she knows that by dating me She's gonna put herself in a specific spot, especially that everyone is religious in her family and she is as well.  So it's.  It's sad.  I think that is the most heartbreaking experience because you know I just sit in the end in the corner and think to myself why do I have to be the one that people would question?  why do I have to be the one that people are not sure about?  always you know just because I'm trans if I were cis it would probably be like literally the opposite because I have everything that she wants.  I just I'm not like other guys you know.  So yeah, that sucked.  I think the third type of rejection are people that will just reject you for the idea.  They're just like, oh, I'm not going to date a trans person.  They don't know what a trans person specifically is or what type of trans person are you.  Because trans people have different body parts, let's say.  It could be like pre-surgery, after surgery.  Like they will literally just not want to date you because you're trans and just that idea of it.  Those are the people that you literally should not encounter in your life whatsoever.  You should be able to build up a space that doesn't put those people in your way.  With me coming back to the online life after a year of deciding to go stealth, went wrong.  I didn't like really, I felt like so much pressure, you know, and I felt that dating would be way harder if I were stealth.  But being out online and everything, so everyone that approaches me, I automatically know that they know I'm trans.  They know I think like that and that.  And they're cool with it already, so it's not gonna be a topic that we'll discuss.  Will you accept me?  Will you still love me because I'm trans?  I fucking hate that.  Like, who are you to be sitting deciding whether I'm worthy or not of your attention or time?  Like... Come on.  And it's usually like, what sucks is that it could be people that I'm considered maybe more attractive than or smarter than or I have more to give than, like, in general.  But still, with that little piece of me being trans, it's just gonna make me automatically lower.  No.  We don't need those people.  We don't want those people.  Yeah, that's my take on this topic.  If you guys have a story of your own, feel free to share it.  We need that right now.  We need to know that we're not alone and you're not for sure.  So thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in another video.  Bye. ",
