            "text": "When I was in my late teens, I dated a moron.  I mean, it's kind of a rite of passage, isn't it?  Anyway, this moron was 10 years older than me.  And so I thought he had his shit together.  But spoiler alert, he didn't.  He was actually obsessed with get rich quick schemes, whether those be little ones, like how he managed a Discovery Channel store, and he would pretend to break big ticket items and then sell them on eBay, or big schemes like house flipping.  I didn't know at the time what house flipping was, that whole subprime thing hadn't happened yet.  But I learned all about it because he had purchased these DVD sets for some exorbitant amount of money.  I'm talking like hundreds of dollars that he didn't really have from people who claimed to have gotten rich by doing this, by flipping houses.  And we could tell that they had gotten rich from it because they were doing their camera interviews lounging next to fancy pools or sitting on the hoods of their sports cars.  My eventual ex never did end up buying a house, let alone flipping one.  And I soon came to realize that these people weren't getting rich necessarily from flipping houses.  They were getting rich because people like my boyfriend were sending them hundreds of dollars for a few DVDs of them shipping champagne and laughing about all the money they made.  The actual advice they gave on those DVDs was really nonspecific and probably pretty bad in retrospect.  I realized it was the same scam that had been going on for longer than DVDs have even been in existence.  Back in the 70s and 80s, when newspaper personal ads were a thing, you would often see these ads.  that said things like, make hundreds of dollars fast without leaving your home.  Send $10 and a self-addressed stamped envelope to this address to learn more.  And when you send along your $10 in your self-addressed stamped envelope, you would get that envelope back with a pamphlet inside.  that said, here's how you make all the money.  You put a personal ad in the newspaper and say, make hundreds of dollars fast without leaving your home.  Send $10 in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  You get the idea.  Uh, it's technically true, you know, kind of legal, sort of brilliant.  You gotta admire it a little.  It's my great displeasure, though, to point out that the spirit of this type of scam is still alive and well today, and it's taking place, of course, on YouTube.  Uh, financial success gurus claim to be able to teach you, mere poor mortal, how to live the lifestyle of your dreams without actually you know, working for it or getting good at anything.  I learned about this thanks to the YouTube channel Coffee Break, which is run by a guy named Steven who talks about media and marketing and things like that.  He recently made a video exposing a man named Kevin David, a quote unquote financial success guru, basically a guy who claims to be able to help you get rich quick.  I went to Kevin David's website and I immediately recognized him as being from the exact same ilk as the many different people making the DVD sets that my moronic ex-boyfriend invested in in the hopes of becoming a millionaire.  Fancy car, check, everything.  testimonials check testimonials from people who claim that they made a bunch of money from him but have a bunch of other profiles under different names around the internet like oh you're making hundreds of thousands of dollars while supporting two young children.  brit Yes, in fact, that does sound fake.  Check.  Coarse materials that cost hundreds to thousands of dollars.  Check.  Small print that makes refunds very, very hard to get.  Check.  Kevin David's Get Rich Quick scheme involves encouraging people to buy wholesale products from sites like Alibaba, and then reselling them, drop shipping them to customers via sites like Amazon at a steep markup.  But he doesn't apparently bother to mention that the profit isn't anywhere near what he's claiming it would be. ",

            "text": "For one, like, you can very easily find this listing on Amazon and run the AMZScout profit calculator.  And the FBA fee is $12.91.  So, I mean, immediately, Amazon's taking 27%.  And that's, like, it took me two seconds to tell you guys that.  I mean, he could have mentioned that in two seconds, chose not to.  Also, like, going back to the Alibaba portion, it's extremely well-known by anybody that's ever sold on Amazon that The prices you see in search results are to entice you to reach out to them.  They're not the real prices.  Or they are the real prices if you order 10,000 pieces instead of 100 pieces.  If you order 100 pieces, you're going to get quoted like most likely $9 a unit, something a lot higher than $2.39. ",

            "text": "Coffee Break's video didn't really focus on that stuff.  He just described how Kevin David seems to have a habit of plagiarizing other gurus word for word.  I won't link to those videos here for several reasons.  One, you can just click on over to Coffee Break's Twitter thread to see those.  But two, because you can't see them on Coffee Break's YouTube, channel because David has filed a copyright claim forcing that video's removal.  So I won't be showing any of David's videos here, just in case.  David also, though, claims that his name itself is copyrighted, which is strange because you can't really copyright a person's name.  I mean, you might be able to make a good case for it if your name was, like, Unicorn Ray of Light Burp Skateboard or... Prince, maybe.  No, that's not actually what that case was about.  But a name like Kevin David, that's like the most basic. ",
