            "text": "The governor of Wisconsin is considering a full confiscation of AR-15s.  Stick by and listen to this one.  Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your source for Second Amendment news.  I literally just landed back from the Olight event in Georgia.  A little... Little beat up with the flight, but I wanted to play a little catch up.  So the governor of Wisconsin, whose name is Tony Evers, he came out and said that he is seriously contemplating a mandatory buyback of AR-15s in his state.  What first started with Beto, Betamail, has now progressed to a couple more loudmouths actually spewing the true intention of the Democrats, and that is to confiscate and buy back anything and everything they can to disarm the American populace.  In fact, we even had Joe Biden himself, the leader of the Bobo Party, come out yesterday and said, if you think an AR-15 is going to protect you from the government, then you need to rethink that.  You need an F-15.  You need an attack fighter.  And I'm paraphrasing, but that's what he said.  So it started out with beta mail.  It went to Wisconsin, the governor, and now you have the favored candidate in the Democrat Party telling you that the government would use fighter jets against the people if they ever decided to use an AR-15 to defend themselves.  What does tyranny look like to you?  So the Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader, his name is Scott Fitzgerald.  And the assembly speaker, Robin Voss, said in a joint statement, and I'll quote this, quote, with Governor Evers considering confiscating firearms from law-abiding citizens, it shows just how radical Democrats have become.  And it's true.  They're out there spewing this nonsense.  Even people who don't have a shot, like Beta Male or Kamala Harris, they're all talking about confiscating guns.  It is the platform of the Democrats right now.  Now, of course, the Republicans in Wisconsin said this will never happen as long as we're in control, but what they should be doing is taking action.  Again, I will throw this softball pitch out there for you, something that I would like for you to address in the comments.  How does the government buy back something they didn't own in the first place, and why do they think they can even do that?  My stuff's not for sale, never will be.  The Assembly Majority Leader for Wisconsin, I'm going to try this name, I hope I don't butcher it, Jim Stein, Steinecke, or Steen, Stein, Ecke, Stink Eye?  I don't know.  But he sent out a tweet and said, This morning's candid comments from Governor Evers only further illustrate that without a strong Republican-led legislature, the idea of involuntary seizure of firearms could easily become a reality in Wisconsin.  This has to come to a head sooner or later.  Something has to give.  I know it's not going to be us.  Wisconsin, you need to start talking some sense into these people.  Hold them accountable.  Make those calls.  Make those visits.  The visits are always great when you show up and call them out in public.  Just remember, don't go crazy.  You don't want to get red flagged or whatever.  So please pass this along, especially if you know somebody who lives in Wisconsin because as you have seen month after month after month, something that some Yahoo tries in their state, very shortly after another Yahoo tries to replicate it and outdo them.  So now we have Wisconsin saying we're going to buy back all these, well, at least contemplating buying back all of these AR-15s that they never owned in the first place is a confiscation.  So please pass it along and consider joining the channel if you haven't already.  This is where you're going to get the Second Amendment news, good, bad, ugly, or indifferent, just plain, just as it is.  No fluff, no tilt, no slant.  Thank you all for your time.  I appreciate it more than you know.  Until we see each other again, this is Jared from Gun to Gadgets.  Be safe.  Stay vigilant and carry your weapon.  Take care, everybody. ",
