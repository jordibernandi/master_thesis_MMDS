And so why would a regular person need all of that?  There's much being said about mental illness, and so I don't think we want to criminalize mentally ill people, right?  I have the ability as a police officer to take someone into custody for 72 hours on a 5150 hole.  If I deem that you're a danger to yourself, to others, or you're unable to provide care for yourself, but to just go around and involuntarily confine people because they have mental illness is not the way to go.

I'm going to give you the names of the people that are going to say I'm amazing and I really should have a gun when really right two doors down is someone who knows I should not.
