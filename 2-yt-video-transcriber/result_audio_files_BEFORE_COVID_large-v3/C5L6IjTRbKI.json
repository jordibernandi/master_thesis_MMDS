            "text": "But see, what's sad today is this is also becoming a common practice within what we might call the charismatic movement in America today.  There are certain leaders who have taken to themselves the title of being an apostle.  And in fact, I've had people come to me and say, well, there's the five-fold ministry, apostle, pastor, teacher, evangelist, prophet, and so forth.  Which one are you?  And, you know, it's kind of a crazy thing.  Like, you have to have all these five ministries together in one place in order for the church to go forward.  And recently, one of the guys told me, you need to leave Calvary and join with me and some other guys, and you're the apostle of this great movement.  And we have to have these five parts of the ministry come together so that we can begin to see the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in great and wondrous ways.  But recently I was reading the blog by one of the most famous and well-known of these particular apostles, and he made some amazing statements.  Well, he basically said this, while doctrine is vitally important, it is not a strong enough foundation to bear the weight of his glory that is about to be revealed through true unity.  For the last several years, people have started to gather around fathers instead of doctrine.  And apostles are first and foremost fathers by nature.  Now, I don't know if that sunk in with you, but as I was reading this, I thought to myself, this is an incredible false doctrine.  We start by saying, well, you know, doctrine is important.  It's really vitally important, but we're not going to talk about it anymore today.  We're going to move on to what?  We're going to begin to... The Word of God is not a strong enough foundation.  But what really struck me as I was contemplating, and I read the entire blog, that essentially this gentleman went on to say that when he speaks, that the New Testament isn't the end of God's revelation, but as he speaks, God is bringing new and further revelation.  I know another guy who said that.  Joe Smith.  You know, there's lots of those people out there who have said that, and yet the problem is they're saying things that don't agree with the revealed truth that God has given us in Scripture.  I often wonder when Paul warned, he said in the end times, that God would get people over to a strong delusion.  I mean, not just deception, but something very, very powerful in its ability to deceive.  And one of the things that many are crying out about, at least conservative biblical leaders are crying out from, is the fact that we are leaving the Bible behind and we're leaving behind many of the central doctrines of the Bible.  It's interesting that when we talk about foundations, we find that Scripture says that the foundation of the church is Jesus Christ.  The foundation is the teachings of the apostles with the chief cornerstone being Jesus Christ.  That's the foundation.  It's not you or me.  It's not any individual.  But then the ideas of true unity, in other words, getting everybody together and rally behind an individual leader, basically we look to church fathers who essentially slash apostles.  And we look for those apostles and we gather around apostles.  Do you know what he's saying?  We follow men.  Amen.  Now, part of the rap that we have laid against the Roman church and even to some degree the Orthodox church is they have leaders which have ex-cathedra possibilities.  In other words, when they speak, they are speaking on the behalf of Christ and their words have the same authority as Christ's words.  The bishop of Rome, basically, in the 19th century, they developed a doctrine called infallibility, papal infallibility, which means that they can't make any erroneous pronouncement in doctrine.  So they say, this is what the Bible says, and this is what we need to focus on.  That becomes the same as if it's coming literally from the mouth of God, which I think that any time we claim that everything that comes from our mouth is from the mouth of God, we've already erred in a very serious way.  it staggers me that people would have the boldness to arrogate to themselves that kind of authority.  is the fact that we are leaving the Bible behind, and we're leaving behind many of the central doctrines of the Bible, particularly the one that none of us like called hell.  Well, I would just simply say that the words of Jesus were, do not be deceived.  Paul gave the warning, he said, for such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as the apostles of Christ.  Masquerading as the Apostle of Christ.  Paul said, I was called, I was sent forth as a messenger to preach the gospel where it had never been preached.  I doubt very seriously, because we have no scriptural indication that Paul went around with a title, refer to me as the apostle, please.  He was just simply Paul.  He begins, Paul, the bond slave of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle according to the will of God.  But you see, we insert capital A as apostle.  He says, my ministry is to go forth and plant churches, to build the work of God, to lay foundations where it's never been preached before.  I think that the A apostles ended with the 12 apostles.  They became part of that foundation church. ",
