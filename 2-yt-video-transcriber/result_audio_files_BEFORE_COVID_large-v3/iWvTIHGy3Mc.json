            "text": "Shalom, I'm Amir Tsarfati from Behold Israel Ministry.  In Luke 24, right after Jesus resurrected, He revealed to His disciples the reason for their lack of understanding of who He is, the purpose of His coming, and the timing of it.  Jesus talked to them about their lack of faith in the things that the prophets had written concerning him.  He didn't say, why don't you read the Bible?  He basically said, why don't you believe the words of the prophets?  Today, the majority of the church is still in the dark concerning Jesus' return to take his bride to be with him and his coming to earth to judge and reign.  Join me and Pastor Barry Stagner, Pastor Jack Hibbs, and Jan Markell on May 11 at Church on the Queensway in Toronto, Canada for our Awaiting His Return Conference.  It'll be a great time of teaching from the Word of God.  in light of current events for encouragements concerning His soon return.  Please visit our website, BeholdIsrael.org, for more information and registration.  See you there soon.  Thank you. ",
