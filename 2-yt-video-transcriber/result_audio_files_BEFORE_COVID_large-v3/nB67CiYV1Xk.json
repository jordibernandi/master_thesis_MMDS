            "text": "Hello there, my friends.  Chris Marcus here with you for Arcadia Economics.  And today, a quick excerpt from an interview I did with Jim Willey back on January 3rd of 2020, where he talked about some of the pressures that have been building on the LBMA and the COMEX.  And certainly as I continue to hear concerns about the deliverable metal there, and especially with what's been going on in the palladium market recently, I thought this one would be a good one to chop out and share again.  Now certainly I know there's some people only like hearing the full interview with Jim, so the links for, it was divided into two parts, links for both parts are down below if that's what you would like.  Although obviously some of those interviews are a little bit on the longer side.  So for folks that like the shorter excerpts, I thought this would be a relevant one worth sharing.  And with that said, I think you'll enjoy.  So here we go. ",

Just if you could give a quick comment and then I can let you run, because I sure do appreciate your time today.  I'm starting to hear whispers from a couple different places about LBMA, golds are possibly getting close to the point where someone's taking a lot of delivery and maybe reaching a break point.  Have you heard anything to that effect? ",

            "text": "Well, the entire exchange for physical that came into being in a big way and big volume early in 2019, that is evidence of a breakdown.  Because the volume of the fake delivery to close out contracts exceeds by a factor of two or three to one the global mine output.  So you're starting to see evidence of a breakdown.  And then two months ago, they had a new category of gold.  It's eligible and then register, but now there's a new one called pledged.  And I like to call it, it's not a pledge category, it's a stolen category.  I mean, let's get real.  I don't go for nonsensical names and nomenclature.  What they're doing is they're stretching the hypothecation of legitimate gold accounts And I would not want to have a family fortune sitting in a European bullion bank account.  I would much rather have it in a Zurich, London, Hong Kong, Singapore, formerly bonded vault facility.  So I believe we're getting to the point now where the system for the comics and the LBMA, often just called the London gold market, I believe we're getting the whole system stretched.  There's a very important point that can be told about the last three or four months.  Typically when the gold price rises, so does the official, not the specs, but the commercial, shorts in gold.  The volume of the commercial shorts in gold rises with the increase in the gold price.  Now, it was about, I don't know, early October, late September, right around there, we hit a nice high in gold.  It was 1,750 or thereabout, don't hold me to the exact number.  When the price came down $150 or more.  The typical reaction within the futures market is that with a lowering gold price, you get a lowering of the open interest short position for the commercials.  And the exact opposite happened for the first time ever.  As the price of gold went down, they had to continue shorting it because the buyers came in, new buyers, and I think they're Chinese with a New York front. ",
