I was just looking at one of those many van life videos where, you know, this 20-year-old chick, you know, they all look the same practically.  And they basically have these vans, right?  And then they're out there and they like stay in a Walmart parking lot and then boom, they've got 80,000 patreon subscribers and an income of about nine hundred thousand dollars every year.  and it's kind of kind of sad but it's a mechanism that has existed since the dawn of time.  And I am going to plagiarize a word or a phrase from David Brin, an author that I am rather fond of.  And he basically coined the phrase rescue fever.  And what that is, is where, pardon the noise.  Anyway, rescue fever, and that's where the, where a guy, right, if he sees a woman who's in danger or in distress or in need, and we just have this basic, really strong instinct to come to the rescue, and all that, right?  And then, of course, support her, make her prosperous, and then, of course, usually the whole family thing occurs after that, and you know the whole story, right?  Well, in the past, that was functional. ",

            "text": "Now, rescue fever, that's where... I mean, these, I mean, so basically these women, right, they, they have like, they have like a whole army of Patreon subscribers and they just, you know, massive, insane amounts of money.  But times have changed.  Rescue Fever is no longer a functional reproductive strategy for our guys.  We are valued for our resources and our productivity and all that good stuff.  And we have such a prosperous society that we We no longer... We're no longer all that valuable to a woman because they have the government to take all our money, you know, by force.  So they don't need to meet us halfway, you know.  So it's, you know, it's kind of unfortunate.  But the problem with that, I mean, that's... They are prosperous now.  They no longer need us, true.  But it's... But the problem is we have not been released.  The instinct for rescue fever and to protect and provide for women, I mean, it's just as strong as it ever was.  So we're here.  So here we are.  We need them more than they do, especially when we're in our 20s.  And when somebody needs you and they really want you and you don't need or want them and it's like, get away from me.  That's why they would be reacting with such exasperation as a general rule, you know.  And it's not a perfect world, but at least we're not dying of like scurvy and stuff these days that often.  So, rescue fever.  They have been released from their need of us, yet we have not been released from our need for them.  At least when we're young.  So, the only thing we can do is just... watch what we do and watch what we think and watch and try to warn other guys about what we're dealing with because rescue fever is just.  it's just ready to turn us into a freaking slave to some woman.  it's uh and it's unfortunate because it was designed or developed or evolved to basically, you know, make men and women partners.  And that is the way it should have been, but that is long gone.  We are no longer partners.  It's a post-parasite situation, at least when you apply government force.  Oh, that's a nice truck.  Tires are bigger than I like though.  Almost looks like super singles.  That's kind of neat.  Hold on for just a moment.  So it's kind of interesting how rescue fever is kind of like the the male equivalent of hypergamy.  basically it's a reproductive strategy that used to work and uh and actually re rescue fever works freaking amazing for women their their ability to show vulnerability or demonstrate vulnerability, like high-heeled shoes and the wobbly, unsteady gait that causes a guy to want to, you know, support them, help them, keep them from falling and breaking their skull.  So basically, oops, hold on.  So both rescue fever and hypergamy are designed to partner men and women up.  But these days, all it does is cause a woman to be able to wrap a guy around her finger and then drain him of his resources, then apply government force and harvest the rest of everything he has, and then obliterate him in divorce court and set him up with massive amounts of debt and an insane amount of child support and alimony that has been shoved through the stratosphere.  because the judge says, oh, I think that you, if you worked a little harder, you could make more.  So they base the freaking thing, they call that imputed income.  They base the income on a higher level than you ever earned.  But they say, well, you don't have to support a woman.  So therefore, we're going to take all your money.  So as everybody always says, or all MGTOs anyway, a woman's appearance of vulnerability is her strength.  I mean, when a woman is vulnerable, it attracts.  men to come and help, right?  That's why oftentimes women can just jump into foreign countries and just be, you know, feel reasonably safe because every time you turn around somebody's ready there to help them, you know?  And how do feminists see this?  What they see is a self-centered desire of men to descend upon vulnerable women and pump and dump them with superior economic force in a way that is like the equivalent of a financial rape or something, right?  Well, there's a point.  There is.  That is a point.  You know, women are attracted to greater power and wealth.  They always have been.  And, but saying that that is a, uh, that's like force is, uh, it's like over the top.  And I'm home.  So what is it that I'm trying to say with this whole, whole big, huge thing?  If you can boil it down to a couple of sentences, then it's a lot easier to remember.  So what are the usual facts that we could apply to this?  And that is female vulnerability attracts men.  Male vulnerability repels women.  This is like stuff right out of Myth of Male Power by Warren Farrell. ",

And everything, every last little penny, if she happens to take you on vacation, every time you draw breath in her presence, she will demand that you remember that and be thanking her for that at least five times a day.  But anything you do for her will be forgotten.  Boom.  You're immediately starting from zero every single day.  And men are very much aware of that.  And that's one of the reasons we're walking away.  So, hypergamy.  Female wealth means nothing to a man.  Because we know darn well we're not going to see any of it.  And... On top of that, it all has strings attached to it.  And the only thing that means is that it increases our vulnerability.  Because when a woman gains a lot of financial power, divorces shoot through the ceiling.  And then she's off looking for another guy.  Who basically checks the check marks for her.

But women, of course, were feminists.  say which is like most women?  uh they say oh i'm not a feminist but when it comes down to profit they will apply that power of feminism and wring every penny they can out of you while saying i'm not like the others.  okay so female?  um female hypergamy I mean, that is still exists.  But the problem is with government force, she can pair off with a guy and then effectively marry his money, then throw the guy away and take the money.  That is not a functional situation these days.  And men who, and then they have the nerve to be all angry and upset and even more dismissive and derisive and, you know, like critical of men because we're not stumping up and getting married.

And that applies MSM and blood root directly to that rectal tumor.  And it's got to be having some kind of effect.  And I've been escalating blood root by one drop every day.  You know, like one drop, then two drops the next day.  I got up to five a couple of days ago.  And then... Something happened.  It appeared to be chewing into the tumor a lot and I got a good deal of blood, right?  So I took a day off of the enema and then I started over again yesterday with one drop.  And I'll probably just go up to four drops and then probably take a day off or something and sort of pulse it like that.  This is all just theory.  I'm a heavy diesel truck mechanic trying to cure my own cancer.  It's either heroic and macho as can be, or freaking stupid.  Only time will tell.  So that's about all I got for you, MGTOs.
