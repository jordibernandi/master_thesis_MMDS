            "text": "Get back out of here.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  What you just saw?  there was a Texas State University student dressed like Antifa and having a bit of a rough time with police.  The whole little kerfuffle started when a Trump supporting student apparently had his hat stolen and kicked.  Don't touch her.  That she move assault.  Hey.  No, no, no.  police arrested four Texas State students overall.  Tyler, the student who says his hat got stolen, didn't want to reveal his full name to avoid getting doxxed, but told a colleague of mine over at Campus Reform that he felt someone take the hat off of his head, and that he ran after the girl and grabbed her backpack, but never her, for around five seconds before asking for his hat back.  but she reportedly didn't give it back until the po-po came when she dropped and kicked it like you just saw.  And the unhinged hysteria only intensified after that.  Move!  Why are you here?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, you're escalating the situation again.  No, I was the reason that I'm... Get out!  Why are you here?  Why are you here?  Leave!  You f***ing crazy f***ing... So it's not clear whether the masked student we saw earlier calls herself Antifa, but just a reminder that even though we haven't had a proper Antifa video on campus unmasked for a little while now, they're still out there.  It looks like journalist Andy Ngo out in Portland had a little run-in with one on Wednesday.  The best thing you can do when they pepper spray you, knock off and kick your MAGA hat, and so on, is simply don't let them off the hook.  It may take a little extra time, but upload that video to social media.  File that police report.  You might end up with some cases like bike lock professor Eric Clanton, who got all felony charges dropped, but even in a corrupt system, if you stack evidence upon evidence upon evidence, eventually something's gotta change, right?
