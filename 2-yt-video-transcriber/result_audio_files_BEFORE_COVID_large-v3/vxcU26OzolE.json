            "text": "I have a 12-year-old and 8-year-old.  I have a son also.  He's 11.  They both participated in the last youth strike.  I said to my daughter, well, what's that?  And she said, mommy, well, you know climate change is coming.  If he goes out on strike, I'll definitely be there.  My name is Micah.  And my name's Valerie.  We're in seventh grade.  The reason why we are here is because we want a future for our generation.  The young people are the ones who realize, like, hey, you've got to stop this train or you're going over the edge.  If we only have one planet, then we only have one chance.  There is a different energy leading this than the folks in the generations that came before.  These young people are talking about a future world that they're going to live in.  And if we care about them and we care about the future, we have to respect what they're saying.  This change is coming anyway, with or without us.  This is not theoretical for our members.  I saw firsthand the disaster of Typhoon Haiyan.  Workers die every year of heat stroke in the fields in California and in Texas.  Not an option for politicians to continue to play into the hands of the oil and gas companies.  A Green New Deal needs to change that relationship, and people are looking for what can we change it to.  It is about... Not having this separation between workers and climate.  What made me get involved with Climate Action, because we had to create jobs.  And there's many jobs that can be created when we get rid of fossil fuels.  If we're not part of the response to climate change, we're going to be left behind.  We have the end point, and I think now we're starting to speak, okay, how are we going to get there?  It is one of the greatest sources of optimism for me that the youth have taken on this issue.  We're not going to make the same mistakes that our great grandparents did, that even our parents did.  I saw a sign today that said, our climate is changing, why aren't we?  They are relentless and they are fearless.  And they're taking initiative and they need our support. ",
