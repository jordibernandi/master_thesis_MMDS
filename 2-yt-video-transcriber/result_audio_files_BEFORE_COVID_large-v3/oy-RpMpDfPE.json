            "text": "Good morning, everybody.  This is Steve Fletcher with the Trumpet for My People.  Today is March 19th, 2019, and we're just one day away from the spring equinox and the beginning of Purim.  that goes between March 20th and March 22nd.  And there is an amazing connection to the resurrection of Lazarus, quite possibly on The day of the spring equinox.  I shared a video on my Facebook page by Nick Vanderlaan.  An amazing video that he shared about the resurrection of Lazarus on the spring equinox.  And I have some thoughts I want to add to what he was sharing.  And according to the calendar that he is watching, the... The Enoch calendar, the last day of the year is the spring equinox.  And Jesus talked about the 12 hours in a day on the resurrection of Lazarus in John chapter 11.  Starting in verse 6, it says, If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world.  So as Jesus was talking about the resurrection of Lazarus, he shares this detail or a cryptic statement or a clue that Quite possibly linking to the time of the spring equinox.  The spring equinox on both equinoxes in the spring and the fall.  Equinox means equal nights in Latin.  Equal nights in Latin.  The sun is directly over the equator at noon.  The Tropic of Capricorn experiences 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.  The Sun is 23.5 degrees off of the Zenith Antarctic Circle, and it experiences 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.  So it's in the spring and the fall.  It's the only day of the year that at the equator, A day lasts 12 hours and a night lasts 12 hours at all latitudes.  Sunlight strikes the earth most directly at the equator.  So that is one connection to the resurrection of Lazarus at the time of the equinox when it's 12 hours in the day and 12 hours in the night.  And resurrection of Lazarus represents the dead in Christ rising first.  It goes on to say, in the same chapter, in the same passage, talking about the resurrection of Lazarus, Martha said to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  So here we have a connection between the spring day equinox and the last day with 12 hours in a day, 12 hours in the night.  Plus we have the last day, which Purim is the last feast of the year.  And so between the spring equinox and the last day of Purim, we have this March 21st, March 22 connection between, Right here in this year, which is the 70th year of Israel, the last Jubilee, and it's just all coming together with all the biblical revelations leading us to this time of Purim, which is the representation of the Antichrist Haman wanting to destroy.
