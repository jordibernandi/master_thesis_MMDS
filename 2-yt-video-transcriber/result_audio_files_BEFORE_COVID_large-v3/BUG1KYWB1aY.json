It's a very disturbing video which contains profanity and minor violence in which I am not, I repeat, I am not promoting.  It's a video to expose more and more of these corrupt police officers here in America.  And do note that no copyright infringement is intended, although the police released it to the public.  Here is the video.  Open the door.  Yeah, we are.  Open the door right now.  Open this door, I'm gonna fucking kick it. ",

You guys have plenty of opportunities.  It's time to go.  Look at his face.  He was nowhere near y'all, though.  It doesn't matter what you say.  He was nowhere near y'all.  Back up.  He can say what he wants.  Stay there.  You guys better go home.  Look at his face.  It doesn't matter what you say.  Why is he screaming like that?  I am in, come on.  See what I'm saying?  You listen to what you're told, you go home.  You don't listen, you go out of town.  That's correct though, they weren't involved.  That's false.  Get the fuck out of here, go!  Now!  Back off!  You don't touch me!  You don't touch me!  You don't touch me, fucker!  Don't touch me in the face!  Motherfucker!  What you touching me for?  What you hitting me for?  What you hitting me for?

Shut your mouth.  Look at me.  Get this guy.  Get the fuck off.  I ain't do nothing.  I don't know what made you want to spaz on me.  Make an example.  I ain't do nothing to you.  I don't got nothing against you.  I ain't even do nothing.  I just got hit.  I don't even know what you're fighting for.  I got one already.  This car?  Which one?  I got one of mine.  Yeah, right, motherfucker.  My feedback to this video is, you know, I know some police officers are good officers and many are corrupt cowards such as these officers in this video.  A gun in a badge makes a lot of people feel so big and bad within themselves to cover and hide the cowardness that's embedded in them.  Now, of course, we don't know the full extent, the full details on why these officers were called to the residence, but I can say that the behavior was way out of line.  Feel free to leave your thoughts, your comments, and feedback to this video.  I am concluded.  I am Tony Harvin, and thank you for viewing my channel.  God bless. ",
