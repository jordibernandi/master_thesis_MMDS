            "text": "Keep of our fathers living still in spite of death.  An open letter to Pope Francis, written in Vatican City on October 26th, the year of our Lord, 2019.  Your Holiness, my name is Michael Matt.  I'm an American cradle Catholic, educated in Catholic schools from the first grade through university.  I'm also father to seven children.  I'm a faithful Catholic and have never missed Mass intentionally on Sunday or a Holy Day of Obligation.  I'm a Catholic newspaper publisher, and I come from a long line of Catholic newspaper publishers and editors.  My great-grandfather founded the oldest weekly Catholic newspaper in America.  My grandfather was made a Knight of St.  Gregory for his service to the Catholic press apostolate, right here in Rome, by your predecessor of happy memory, Pope Pius XI.  For 150 years, my family has been in the Catholic press apostolate, defending the Church against aggressors on all sides.  When the Nazis occupied Rome, my grandfather's newspaper was placed on a blacklist and banned from being mailed into Germany by order of Adolf Hitler himself.  When the Allies liberated Italy, my own father, serving in the US Army in 1944, marched into Rome and was with troops blessed by Papa Bocelli himself after the war had ended.  So when I say I am a loyal Catholic, I am speaking for myself, my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, Catholic men of the press who devoted their lives to the defense of Catholic tradition, to the papacy, and to the fallible teachings of your predecessors.  After 150 years in the Catholic Press apostolate, it is unthinkable that one of us should resist Peter to his face.  And yet I come to you today with sadness in my Catholic heart, as the winds of the modernism condemned by your sainted predecessor over 100 years ago are today blowing through the colonnades, down the Via della Conciliazione, over the Tiber, and out into the whole world under your watch.  The spirits of my fathers cry out from their graves as Rome is raising the white flag of surrender and losing the faith, exactly as Our Lady of La Salette predicted she would.  This eternal city, baptized in the blood of your martyred first predecessors, is returning to its pagan roots under your watch.  At your Amazon Synod here in Rome, the world was told that Peter himself was looking to the pagans for enlightenment, listening to them, learning from them.  But is this what Christ asked of you, Holy Father, to listen to pagans and to learn from the world?  The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us for another reason, or so the Church taught for two thousand years.  Christ hung from the cross so that he could take the sins of the world upon himself, so that he could open the gates of heaven that were, according to Scripture, closed by the sin of our first parents in the Garden of Eden.  Do you still believe this doctrine of the Church?  The Holy Ghost ascended upon your own predecessors in order to establish a Church that would make all men on earth heirs of heaven and sons of God.  Do you still believe this, Holy Father?  The Church Christ founded according to the infallible teachings of the Church, the sole means of salvation, is the one true Church outside of which there is no salvation.  Do you, Holy Father, still accept this dogma of the Catholic Church?  If it has done anything at all, your synod, your Amazon synod, has conveyed the impression to the whole world that the Pope of Rome has reneged on the Church's own teaching that she is the sole means of salvation.  Is this the message you intended to send?  If not, please understand, Holy Father, that this is the message the world has received this past week at your Synod, along with the message that you may or may not believe that hell exists, that you may or may not believe that Jesus Christ was divine while on earth.  In the face of such incredible confusion, Holy Father, faithful Catholics are left with a choice between your words and those of your predecessors, the teachings, the infallible teachings of the Church.  Who are we to believe, you or them?  Your predecessors, up to and including Pope Paul VI, took an oath of coronation in which they vowed to change nothing of the received tradition, to alter nothing, nor to permit any innovation.  They swore to keep whatever has been revealed through Christ and his successors and whatever the first councils and predecessors have defined and declared.  In their coronation oath, they subjected to severest excommunication anyone, be it, quote, ourselves or be it another, who would dare to undertake anything new in contradiction to the constituted evangelical tradition and the purity of the Orthodox faith and the Christian religion, end quote.  Holy Father, I beg you to explain how listening to and learning from pagans is not in contradiction to this noble Catholic tradition your own predecessors swore to defend.  In Amoris Laetitia, you have told the world that unrepentant public adulterers may in certain circumstances return to the sacramental life of the Church, thus placing your own teachings in direct contradiction with the infallible teachings of the Church, reiterated most recently by Pope John Paul II in Familiaris Consortia.  After Abu Dhabi, you informed the world that God wants a brotherhood of all religions.  But how does this not contradict the divine commission of Christ himself, who ordered you to baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost?  When you came to my country, you stood before Congress, in the presence of the most powerful leaders of the world, but you said not one word about Jesus Christ.  I don't believe you even mentioned his name. ",

And how is it not in direct contradiction to the teachings of Pope Pius XI and Mortalia Monimus, which condemned such pan-Christian gatherings on the basis that Christian unity can only be promoted by calling for a return of all Christians to the Catholic Church?  You have said that atheists can go to heaven, thus conveying the impression to the sad and distracted and distressed world that salvation is possible even outside of any belief in God whatsoever.  You have said that it is not your job to judge homosexual priests, thus allowing the world to conclude that the Church has abandoned her own teachings on the sins that cry to Heaven for vengeance.  You have even honored a gay and supposedly married couple with a private audience at which the cameras recorded every moment of your implicit abandonment of the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.  And now the Amazon Synod is opening the door to women deacons, maybe perhaps even women priests, in direct violation not only of the recent teachings of your canonized predecessor in Ordinatione Sacra Totalis, but also to the will of Jesus Christ himself.

            "text": "who are scandalized, not because we want to be scandalized, but because we are, because we see what our Father is doing and saying in contradiction to 2,000 years of Catholic teaching and example.  Is it any surprise that so many of your subjects are now resisting you, are praying to God for your conversion, even questioning whether you are Catholic at all?  Pagan ceremonies in the Vatican gardens, do you think this is helping our Protestant friends come closer to unity with Christ's true Church?  They too are scandalized by what you have done.  And you have convinced many of them that the Pope is indeed the whore of Babylon, as you have driven them further from the flock of Christ and from the bark of St.  Peter.  Please Holy Father, just imagine for a moment the horror of your children in the face of such paternal scandal.  We pray for you, Holy Father, every day.  We refer to you as Holy Father, whether you like it or not, because the office you hold is holy above all others, and even you cannot make it unholy.  Yours is the seat of the Holy Father.  Yours is the sea of Peter, the Holy Sea.  And we honor this too much to allow anyone, even the Pope, to destroy it.  And yet you have made it clear that though you wish to listen to pagans, you have no interest in listening to your own scandalized children, to us, rigid neopelagians that used to be known as practicing Catholics.  In your eyes, we are rigid and fanatical and pharisaical.  But if it's true, then so too were 260 of your own predecessors, rigid, fanatical, and pharisaical.  And this cannot be.  We pray for you, Holy Father.  We weep for you and for our children in this darkest moment of confusion in the Catholic Church throughout the whole world.  But we are also bound in conscience before the dread judgment seat of God himself to resist you honorably to your face.  In fact, we loyal and faithful Catholics promise to put every effort from now until the day we die into resisting you and your agenda of revolutionary change to the church we love.  We promise to teach our children in fidelity to Catholic tradition to resist you to your face and to teach their children to do the same.  We also promise to love and pray for you every day of our lives.  And should the grace of God prompt you to become fully Catholic once again one day before you die, we promise you, Holy Father.  that you will have no greater defenders in all of Christendom than the traditional Catholics that you now seem to despise.  Catholics who will defend the faith handed down to them from their fathers.  Catholics from all around the world who are begging you also to defend that faith and to become the vicar of Christ once again rather than the vicar of the world.  Indeed, true friends of the Pope are neither revolutionaries nor innovators.  They are traditionalists.  We will not leave Holy Mother Church.  We will never abandon Christ our King, even if all the bishops in the world, including the Bishop of Rome, abandon him once again, even as they did 2,000 years ago in Calvary.  Holy Father, we beg you, for God's sake and for the sake of the whole world, listen to the cries of your scattered sheep and become shepherd to them once again.  Become Christ's vicar, become Peter's successor, and become our true Holy Father.  For until that happens, we, your most loyal subjects, have no alternative, have no choice but to resist you to the face.  With God as our witness, this we will do until the day we die, or until you return to the Church of Jesus Christ.  Christus Vincit, Christus Ragnat, Christus Imperat. ",
