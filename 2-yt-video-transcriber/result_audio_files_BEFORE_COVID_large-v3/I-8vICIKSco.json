            "text": "Guys, I am done.  Wow.  Look at me.  I can't believe it.  I see these are movies or Nigerian stars, movie stars, singers.  This is Mina.  hey guys good evening.  how are you all doing?  i'm trying to get the right angle for this.  so i'm introducing you guys to someone very special today.  i've waited for this moment for a very long time.  actually.  today has been very eventful.  i'm stressed out.  as you can see on my face i set out this morning.  i was supposed to actually introduce you guys to this vlog when i woke up in the morning and all.  but I had a lot of things doing, a lot of running around and also I got distracted and stressed out.  But the good thing is I'm finally on my way to where I set out to go.  So let's go.  When we get there, I will introduce you to her.  Well, you must have seen her name in the description box.  But let's go.  Let's go and meet her.  I'm excited.  I can't wait.  So guys, I've finally arrived at Ms.  Trudy's residence where she's staying.  So I'm waiting for her.  I just got here.  I'm waiting for her.  Then we'll do some stuff together.  Guys, I've met her.  I've met Ms.  Trudy.  I'm so excited.  Goodness.  Me too.  So guys like I said I'm here to do some stuff with her so let's get into it.  We're about to do something.  I'm going to transform her into a Nigerian princess.  This is a head wrap like this is what we call geling.  So I'm going to tie this on her head and then these are the The necklace she's going to use and the earrings just, oh my god, the earrings and then the Ankara top.  This is like an Ankara top.  So this is what she's going to put on.  Ah, that will transform her into an Nigerian princess.  I will first beat her face and then... She's going to dress up in this.  So let's see how it goes.  I'm excited, like, oh my goodness.  This feels so surreal that I'm sitting with Miss Trudy.  Miss Trudy!  Miss Trudy is lovely.  Like, she's so down to earth.  Oh my God, like, I was so nervous when I hit her up to, you know, meet her today and do something together.  I thought she was going to, like, calm me down and say, you know, I have some things to do and stuff.  But she was so nice, so warm and lovely and graciously granted me this opportunity.  So, I'm glad.  I'm excited.  Thank you, Ms.  Trudy.  You're welcome.  So, let's get into it.  Clean your face.  Remember to always start with a clean face.  Yeah, that's one thing.  I always used to do my brows last.  This is Pro Concealer, the Elegale Pro Concealer.  So I'm going to use it to clean her brows up and just define the shape more.  This is the Morphe palette in Stunning Vibes 35B.  They do your thing.  What do you call them, Danfo?  I took a ride in your Danfo.  It's called Danfo.  So you guys, just like the ones in Kenya, calling people to come in, very similar.  So yeah, the next relation is like the same.  So if you're from Lagos state, you are sent to for example Abuja?  Abuja, yeah, or Venice where it's a non-vice governor.  Oh, so you cannot remain in your state?  No, France.  Oh, wow.  Why?  Because they want you to know your country or something?  Yeah, it's all about community, national unity.  Oh, wow, that's nice.  But you know, Nigeria is a very diverse country.  Yeah.  We have over almost 500 ethnic groups.  In Kenya we have 46 and they thought that's many.  Because this is a big group.  Yeah, they thought that's many.  500, that's crazy.  Wow, that's a lot.  So I'm just concentrating on the areas where we tend to sweat more.  The video you guys did in Kenya, what West Africans think about East Africans?  What do West Africans think about West Africans?  I watch your videos.  Sometimes I might not comment or I like.  But that one was so funny.  Oh my God, I was laughing so hard when I was watching it.  I was like, God, so many... Then there was something you said that was so funny that everybody was laughing too hard.  But I really didn't hear what... Oh, I didn't hear.  I was going to ask you.  No, I'm serious.  I didn't.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Okay, sometimes you use that.  So funny, but I love it.  To show that you're genuinely sorry.  Sometimes it's used sarcastically.  Oh, it either shows you're genuinely or you're being sarcastic.  Yeah, being sarcastic.  Like, sorry, oh.  I like how you say it.  It's so Nigerian.  Damn, I'm looking so good, you guys.  Oh my gosh.  This is a transformation of I and I. I mean, it's truly.  28, princess.  You guys, you can't wait.  You can already feel it.  What's going to happen?  I don't know what he has to do.  I beg.  What's your name?  I beg.  I beg, yes.  I beg, meaning?  What does it mean?  Please.  Please.  Please.  I beg.  I beg, I beg, I beg.  Guys, when someone is, like, kind of pestering you, I beg, I beg, don't disturb me.  Oh, you sound so good, man.  Don't disturb me, I beg.  I beg, bro.  I beg.  I beg, help me.  Do you want me to do something?  Please help me do it.  So, who do you prefer, Wizkid or Debedo?  I prefer Debedo.  Really?  Most of the people I met prefer Wizkid.  Why Debedo?  Just because there are a few songs that I really love.  Yeah, I agree.  Like a, money follow you, banana follow me, cause I'm in love with you baby.  Is there something about me that takes that?  Are you going to tell me?  Tell me really that I'm talking?  Like I used to.  I don't want to be alone.  That's what I had.  I want to see.  Can I see you now?  Is it possible now?  I beg.  Zebito, you might just run into this video now.  I'm still in Nigeria, oh.  I beg.  Which household?  She's still dead.  I'm still dead.  I was so hurt if I go outside his house.  And you were savage in the mirror that day when you were with us.  Whoa, we were laughing.  You're different.  That's it.  We loved ourselves.  If they flex more, they show yourself.  If they show yourself again.  But if they don't show themselves too, then it's not like time.  Like when they say, if they show themselves again, that is, they're trying to prove a point.  A bit moved.  Right.  A bit.  A bit.  A bit.  A bit.  Like you agree with what the person is saying.  Probably in a... In a sarcastic way, you're saying something derogatory about somebody, and someone concurs, you say, Abby, take that one away.  You should just assume I said that.  Time to go.  Oh my God, I'm laughing.  What do you think they do?  What do you think they do?  What do you think they do?  What do you think they do?  What do you think they do?  What do you think they do?  What do you think they do?  So this is a complete Owambe.  Do you know what Owambe means?  No, what does it mean?  Party.  Ooh, so this is how guys party in Nigeria.  You're going to a wedding, you're going to a naming ceremony, child education.  This is how you go.  Even church.  So you dress like this.  You know, you always like to show off.  Turn up.  This is how they turn up in Nigeria.  So nice.  I am done.  Wow.  Look at me.  I can't believe it.  I see this on movies or Nigerian stars, movie stars, singers.  This is Mina.  Oh my god.  The neck piece.  This is everything.  The earring matches the neck piece and I love it so much.  Like my eyes.  Have I ever looked this good?  Oh my god.  And I'm not even.  I'm speechless.  I'm not exaggerating.  I don't know what to say.  I love this so much.  I love the top.  I love the fact that it's happening.  I'm strapless you guys.  I feel like an Italian princess for real.
