            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  When the sorry saga of Donald Trump's candidacy for president began, he told everybody dozens, if not hundreds of times that yes, absolutely, he would release his tax returns.  Well, that yes quickly morphed into a yes, oh, but I'm under audit, so when that's done, yes.  He never produced any audit letters from the IRS proving that he was actually under audit.  He just expected us to take him for his word.  to take his word for it.  And then finally, when he won the election, he effectively admitted that he was lying and said no one even cared about it anyway, and that now he was president.  So, eh.  You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters.  Okay, they're the only ones.  But no, I don't think so.  I won.  I mean, I became president.  Well, there clearly was interest in Donald Trump's tax returns and continues to be outside of a small circle of intrepid journalists.  The American people absolutely care.  In fact, the reason we care is because back in 1973, it was discovered that Republican President Richard Nixon had paid only seven hundred ninety two dollars for in federal income taxes for 1970 and only $878 for 1971.  And that's despite having an income of more than $200,000 per year.  And ever since then, presidents and presidential candidates have voluntarily released their tax returns as a matter of transparency and a show of ethical adherence.  That is, until Donald Trump, our ethics and morals repellent goon who currently inhabits the White House.  Well, there is a legitimate battle to get Trump's taxes in order to see what kinds of conflicts of interest exist in his current businesses and his dealings around the world.  It is likely that he is enriching himself by utilizing the power and influence of the presidency to his personal and financial advantage.  I mean, we just discovered that he was attempting to withhold already congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine in an effort to pressure them to interfere in our upcoming elections.  Based on that alone, we have the right to know what other sinister financial schemes he's up to.  With the exception of some amazing reporting from the New York Times last year, the information we have about Trump's taxes has come in drips and drabs.  And the latest of those is from ProPublica.  They have uncovered a series of troubling likely crimes related to startling discrepancies between the tax records they obtained from New York State and loan records of Trump's from a company called Ladder Capital.  Here's how ProPublica got the information.  You see, because Donald Trump appealed his property tax bill on some of his properties for nine years in a row, ProPublica reporters were able to use the New York State's Freedom of Information laws to obtain property tax documents related to a number of Trump's properties.  And there were some loan documents from a company called Ladder Capital, which were publicly available because Ladder Capital sold the debt on these certain properties as a part of mortgage backed securities, making them all legally available for the free press to start to piece together the puzzle.  And possessing these separate yet very related documents made it possible for ProPublica to focus in on 40 Wall Street, which is in the financial district in New York City, and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in the Upper West Side.  Here's the scam that Donald Trump was running at the 40 Wall Street property.  Trump would report a different set of figures to New York City tax authorities than he provided the banks when obtaining loans.  He would lie to both the government and to the bank.  He did this to make his building appear less profitable than it actually was to the government to avoid paying property taxes that he owed and more profitable than it was to the bank to secure loans for which he really wasn't qualified.  According to the ProPublica piece, for instance, Trump told the lender that he took in twice as much rent from one building as he reported to tax authorities during the same year, 2017.  He also gave conflicting occupancy figures for one of his signature skyscrapers located at 40 Wall Street.  Lenders like to see a rising occupancy level as a sign of what they call leasing momentum.  Sure enough, the company told a lender that 40 Wall Street had been 58.9% leased on December 31, 2012, and then rose to 95% a few years later.  The company told tax officials the building was 81% rented as of January 5, 2013.  And the Trump Tower International Hotel and Tower scheme was about the same.  Again, according to ProPublica, Trump owns only a small portion of the building, which is located on Columbus Circle, two commercial spaces which he rents out to a restaurant and a parking garage.  Trump's company told New York City tax officials it made about $822,000 renting space to commercial tenants there in 2017.  The company told loan officials it took in $1.67 million that year, more than twice as much.  In eight years of data ProPublica examined for the Columbus Circle property, Trump's company reported gross income to tax authorities that was typically only about 81% of what it reported to the lender.  Listen, when you undervalue your real estate to the government to avoid the taxes you legally owe, and then overvalue when providing sworn documents to the bank to secure loans, this equals two separate crimes, tax fraud and bank fraud, as well as a series of other possible crimes, including mail or wire fraud, depending on the manner with which these frauds were perpetrated.  People go to jail for this, Need I remind everyone that both Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen are in prison right now for, among other things, falsifying bank records and tax records?  And this is a clearly formed pattern for Donald Trump.  Let us not forget only a few months ago that the New York Times did a deep dive into the Trump family finances and uncovered a deeply rooted cross-generational tax fraud scheme, illuminating the ways in which Donald Trump's family manipulated and cheated their way to the top.  The Times reporting conveys an image of young Donnie running to daddy's piggy bank whenever things got tough after getting himself into trouble once the security blanket was gone.  Remember, Donald Trump's father, Fred Christ Trump, was a super rich builder and landowner in New York City.  He owned a lot of different properties.  He also had five kids, one of whom is Mary Ann Trump, who is Donald Trump's older sister.  And it is through her that the New York Times was able to break through the wall of family silence on this vast defrauding of the American government and by way of the government, its people.  You see, Mary Ann Trump is a former federal judge who was required to make her financial disclosures public as a part of her job.  And it is through her mandatory disclosures that the New York Times discovered all of these trust funds and properties from Fred Trump that were funneling money to Mary Trump.  So the Times figured that this would be a glimpse into what Donald Trump had going on as well.  Good afternoon, good afternoon, members of the committee.  It is my privilege to appear before you. ",

            "text": "Donald Trump's sister, Mary Ann Barry Trump, was a federal judge for a number of years.  Like all federal judges, each year that she was a judge, she had to file a financial disclosure form that lists like every asset that she controls.  So I took those 2,200 pages of financial disclosure form she filed and then made this chart.  She listed all the trust funds by name.  She named the actual business entities that she was getting revenue from.  Those were her father's businesses.  So that was a great aid to us.  All the siblings got that same amount.  So what we saw for her was a good proxy for a dialing phone.  It's clear he got more than a couple hundred million dollars from his father just in one swoop, and then millions of dollars every year, it looks like, for decades prior to that. ",

            "text": "As you can see, the work was arduous, and they had difficulty tracking it all down.  Luckily, the investigative reporters kept on it and found other financial documents that led them to a company, All County Building Supply and Maintenance, where the tax fraud scheme was finally uncovered.  According to the New York Times, Donald Trump and his siblings set up the sham corporation, All County Building Supply and Maintenance, to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents.  Records indicate that Donald Trump helped his father make improper tax deductions worth millions more.  and that he also helped formulate a strategy to, and tell me if this sounds familiar, to undervalue his parents' real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, which sharply reduced the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings.  The Times also found that Fred Trump transferred well over a billion dollars in wealth to his kids, which would have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the then 55% tax rate imposed on gifts and inheritances.  The Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5% tax records show.  This is disgusting, all of this.  This is fraud.  This is effectively stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the government, and it shows this to be the beginning of a pattern that would continue long into the future for Donald Trump, into the present day.  This is something Donald Trump doesn't want investigated or made public in any way.  This is why we are just now finding out from the Washington Post reporting that Donald Trump dispatched a political appointee from the Treasury Department to meddle with the perfunctory audit of the sitting president's tax returns.  According to the Washington Post, an Internal Revenue Service official has filed a whistleblower complaint reporting that he was told that at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president's or vice president's tax returns, according to multiple people familiar with the document.  The whistleblower, a career official at the IRS, confirmed in an interview with the Washington Post this week that he had filed a former complaint and sent it to the tax committee chairs in both houses of Congress, including Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, and to the Treasury Department Inspector General for Tax Administration on July 29th.  This is why Democrats need to start flexing their subpoena power authority and start arresting people who defy the co-equal power of the legislative branch.  We can't have a bunch of rogue executive agents running around loyal to and in service to Donald Trump, refusing to testify to what they know related to Donald Trump and his illegal schemes and sinister cover-ups.  It is time to take our country back and set it onto a course of fidelity to the rule of law and respect for the aspirational values we've always claimed to stand for. ",
