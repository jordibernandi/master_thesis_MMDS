            "text": "This is Jonathan Cahn, the author of The Paradigm, the ancient blueprint that holds the mystery of our times.  And we've been opening up in these segments, in these clips, some of the mysteries in the book, The Paradigm.  I can only touch on them, but it's enough to give you a taste of what's there.  And we're at a point right now where we've seen that everything is replay.  what was there in ancient times.  This ancient blueprint, over 2,500 years old, is giving us, is revealing to us the times before they happened, the events before they take place, the dates, even, it's so specific, the people.  And we're getting up to right where we are, and we're seeing the figure of Donald Trump.  and the mystery, the paradigm is the mystery of each of these leaders, and it is an ancient leader.  They're following the prototype of these leaders.  They don't realize it, But it's all replaying.  And we have Donald Trump.  And the mystery behind him is that of Jehu.  Now Jehu comes to the throne.  And he's a wild guy.  And he's unpredictable.  He's a fighter.  Unlikely.  Hadn't served God before.  But now he's moving with believers.  And he comes to the throne.  And what does he find there?  When he gets to the capital city, he sees the Temple of Baal.  Now, the Temple of Baal was actually built by Ahab.  Now, the key here in our times is the Temple of Baal.  Baal is the god linked to the killing of unborn children, also to sexual immorality, also to materialism.  We're seeing all these things in America.  And the killing of unborn children, well, the killing of children, well, in our case, abortion.  So we've seen how already there's fulfillment in that as Jehu came against this cult of Baal, the killing of children, and originally he was for it, but he turned against it.  So Donald Trump, with regard to abortion and seeking to oppose that and seeking for the life of the unborn child.  But could there actually be a temple of Baal?  I mean, literally.  I'm not speaking symbolically.  There actually has existed a temple of Baal, literal.  goes back 2,000 years ago.  An ancient temple of Baal that has survived all the centuries, all the waves of history up to the present time or up to modern times.  But the paradigm says when Jehu rises, the temple of Baal falls.  Because Jehu destroyed, in the paradigm, Jehu destroyed the temple of Baal.  But to end Child sacrifice to end the cult of Baal.  But could it be?  I mean, there's an actual temple of Baal, but it says when the warrior rises, the temple of Baal falls.  The 2,000-year-old temple of Baal in the Middle East that has stood in the Middle East for 2,000 years came crashing to the earth.  It fell as in the paradise.  When it fell, Donald Trump began his rise, it says when the warrior rises, to the presidency.  Two months later, after 2,000 years, the ancient Temple of Baal fell to the earth.  Nobody could have put that together.  Nobody.  Only God.  The paradigm is the paradigm because Everything is woven together.  And it's amazing.  Our lives are woven together.  We're part of it.  We are part of the paradigm.  I want to get to that.  But let me tell you this, that whatever I tell you, I can only, you understand, in the time, I can only give a little taste of what's in the paradigm, in the book.  The book has every revelation and things, and paradigm is what is before it happens and everything else.  But it's available everywhere.  You can get it online or everywhere.  But next time, we're going to get into... Where we are right now, does the paradigm give us a warning of where we are, where we're heading, or what is our choice right now?  What are the stakes right now?  We need to know it because it's affecting all of our lives, affecting your life.  What does the paradigm reveal about that?  That is next time.  That will be the, I believe, the 19th clip.  And it will be about the warning on the paradigm.  Ah. ",
