You actually, in the last one that you posted, asked him the question that I've wanted to figure out for quite a while.  He didn't really answer it.  But in terms of the $600 silver, similar with the $100,000 Bitcoin numbers that his model was shooting out, what I've been wondering, he talked a lot about how manipulation has skewed things, and also how he adjusts and tweaks the model to correct as you go along, which makes sense.  So I'm curious, and you can give your opinion, obviously you can't speak for him, But I wonder if based on everything he's learned, are those numbers still, yes, we expect those to happen.  They've been delayed because of selling a lot of paper silver, tinkering around in the crypto market, yet those are still valid numbers and it's only the timing has been delayed.  What do you think he would feel on that? ",

So he's not getting the correct data, so he's not running his program.  So, I mean, it wouldn't come from his programs.  He's working on a way around that to try to get all the reports going out again.  But he did say, yeah, and it is a situation where the longer he has the information in his data, and this goes back to the 90s, I think he said, for $600 silver.  The longer it is, the bigger the, when it happens, the bigger the boom.  Obviously $600 silver would be a big boom, not just for silver investors, but for the short term. ",

If you follow Ted Butler's stuff, he nails them every time with their own data, and that's the best part about it.  Then our good wonderful friend, Bart Chilton, who has departed now, which is just unbelievable.  That just floored me when I heard that news.  But he was the first to say, hey, it was absolutely manipulated, but I couldn't do anything for political reasons.  You've got to have enough votes on the CFTC, which is shocking, absolutely shocking that a \u2013 a member of the CFTC, a sane member of the CFTC said it's rigged.  And, you know, the ramifications of that should be shaking throughout the silver companies, but silver companies are ridiculous.  I hate to say this, but the management of silver companies to, to allow something like this to happen to your product, to your employees, to your shareholders, that they can rig the market for so long and destroy the financial wherewithal of every single one of your constituents, these people should be hung out to dry along with the manipulators, if you ask me.

I mean, it makes no sense to me, but I get it on a bigger picture that the U.S.  has to support the system.  and have the system running, you can't have an unbacked fiat monetary system without controlling gold and silver prices.

April of 2011 and later on finding evidence, transcripts that, you know, like you mentioned now, years later, Bart and others confirming what happened.  So to me, it seemed, you know, if the dollar was just got, or US got downgraded by S&P, you know, it seemed like it could have been getting out of hand.  And if silver was on the run then, and the only reason it went lower was because of manipulative trading, I thought 50 always seemed like a logical floor.  And then it was years later, you know, hearing a lot of your videos and the other silver guys out there, it's just... And that's what we captured in the book.  where it's just, I interviewed one guy after another and it just like, every time you think, wow, it couldn't be this extreme.
