            "text": "If you want to know what Lincoln cent memorials to look for from 1970 to 1979, then you need to watch this video.  This is Daniel and you are watching Coin Help You and my latest video on Lincoln Memorial Cents from the decade 1970 to 1979.  We are going to cover each date, each mint.  Now, this list is not exhaustive.  I am not including every single variety that you can find, but we're going to go over a few and make a few points.  So please like, share, and comment, and stay tuned.  As you are watching these videos, I want to remind everyone each one of these varieties are known, and each one of these varieties have an early die stage, a medium die stage, and a late die stage.  And for each one of those stages, there are die marks, what we call pups or pickup points.  They could be die cracks.  They could be die marks.  They could be polish lines, different things like that.  That helps you identify these varieties.  Some of these are going to be worth a lot of money.  Most of them are not.  But the ones that are worth a lot of money, they must match the die marks exactly, or it is not the variety that is worth the money.  When we're looking at these, just remember that.  Remember that you need to match die markers, and that's why I use coppercoins.com.  Conica's Variety Vista.  I use Cherry Pickers guides.  I use Strike It Rich for pocket change.  These are books and resources that I have read and studied and researched for years.  And that's what you need to do when you think you found something.  You want to match it up to a picture.  So with that, let's continue on to start looking at some of these coins.  This is the first coin.  It's the 1970s Small Date.  This is one of the most confused Lincoln-sent memorials.  A lot of people call it level seven.  I see it in books, and that's fine if you want to call it that, but I want to point out a couple key things that you need to identify this.  Now, it's not an extremely valuable coin except in the higher grades, but it's still worth finding.  You can still find it in pocket chains, you can still find it in mint sets, and you can still find it in proof sets.  What you want to look at here, you see this nine.  The inside of that nine, the tip of it, points to almost the middle of the seven.  if it's that's on the small date on the large date it's a little flatter and it points to the bottom or underneath the seven.  also the liberty is typically weak.  you'll see a weak liberty struck on these as well.  it's one of the identifying markers and one of the things i was talking about earlier.  it's the die marks.  it's the way the characteristics are of the letters and the numbers and that's how you know that this is a small date versus a large date.  next is a 1970s.  this is the double die averse and this is a a pretty valuable one here and it's a widespread on it because you can see as we pointed out and coming here real close.  you can see on the date there's a little bit here.  you know you got the typical look on a 1970s 60s mint marks.  they've got that that look to them like they've got their little die chips in them.  or you know some people call it clogged up.  here's the liberty.  what it looks like here As you can see, there's pretty good splits on it.  It actually is thicker because of this.  Because you've got a doubled, it's doubled.  On a strike double coin, it's going to make the D thinner, and this is going to be flat right here.  And here is an RPM.  It's S over S. And we'll get in close here and take a look at this.  And as you can see, here's the upper part of the S on this one.  And it's a little thicker down in here.  These are kind of confusing, I know, because these mint marks are not the best mint marks.  And they have all kinds of little bumps in them.  And sometimes they're filled in.  And it's hard to identify some of these.  Now, for 1970, you do have more than one RPM.  Most of these dates have more than one RPM.  Most of them are really common, but kind of bragging rights, say I found an RPM or I found a double die.  Same thing with some of these that have more than one double die.  The next one is the 1971 double die.  And like I said here, it doesn't have a mint mark.  That means it was struck at Philadelphia.  Anytime you look at a Lincoln cent, the only year you're going to have a mint mark on it from Philadelphia is 2017.  They put a P on them for their anniversary.  Otherwise, they will not have a mint mark if they're minted in Philadelphia.  That's normal, unless they're a proof.  Proofs have an S mint mark on them for this date.  Here, get real close and take a look at the Liberty.  It also looks very similar to the other double dyes that we've seen.  And right here, you can kind of see it when I get up really close.  The date has a little here.  And I know the image is just a tad bit blurry, so it's kind of hard to see.  But when you're looking at it, like I said, it's doubled.  It's thicker.  Now we'll go to 1972.  1972 is the year for the double dies in the 1970s.  You have multiple double dies for this date.  And one of the things about that is three of them are extremely valuable, not including the proof.  There is a proof that's double die.  But you have your 72 plane, 01, the 02, and then the 04.  And the 04 is extremely valuable.  And I'm going to show you that one.  It's not an easy, it's not the most obvious double die.  But here's a picture of it on coppercoins.com.  And it shows you all the die marks that you look for.  to identify this one and it has to look exactly like this one.  So you've got a little bit of dye striations here, you've got a little bit of dye wear and it gets worse over time and it can fool you and make you think it's the double dye when it's not.  You've got little tiny cuts forming on the rim.  A cut is a rim-to-rim die break.  It has to be on the rim.  It has to connect the rim, basically.  And that's where you want to find these die marks.  It has to look exactly like this.  You find what it looks like in these pictures.  Go to coppercoins.com and look this up.  Then you know it's the one.  Because you can be easily fooled.  Here's a 1972.  There's RPMs for this date and mint as well.  And we'll look at a couple of them.  And as you can see, the mint marks right here, the weakly struck punch mint mark.  And these were all punched into the dies by hand.  And here's another one.  You can see just the little artifacts of the previously weakly punched or out of place punched mint mark.  And there's little die marks on these as well.  It helps identify it.  Even the RPMs have die marks.  Here's the 72S.  and it's also an RPM.  Actually this one here, here's a 72S and it's the double die.  It's the one that you're gonna see the most.  Right here's the little tail on it.  There's a lot of them that have this.  A lot of them are master die doubled and that means they're extremely common.  They're still worth, you know, five bucks in an uncirculated condition, up to 20 some dollars.  You know, they don't have a whole lot of interest because there's just so many of them.  Here's some more pictures.  Here's the 01.  It's real obvious.  The spreads on this one are just phenomenal.  I mean it's a beautiful double die.  It's almost similar to the 1955 as far as the spread is concerned.  It's a really nice looking coin.  That's easy to identify.  Here's the FS02.  that's valuable, not as valuable as the other 001 or the 04, but it's really nice too.  You can see a little bit of the spread on it as well.  73D, you have a double die, a verse, and here's what it's supposed to look like.  A little thickening of the letters helps identify it.  You can see the die marks on it.  You know, this is one of them.  that's not very obvious.  It is not extremely valuable, but you can find it.  But it's mostly by, you know, there's a little notch in the R of trust.  That's one of the pickup points you want to take a look at first.  You also have the 73d RPM that to look for.  And you can see that the little bit of the D is still inside.  And then down at the bottom here, it also shows you the other die marks to look for when you're looking for that.  Here's another one, and this one confuses some people because it doesn't have large spreads, but you can see just a little bit of where the old mint marks met on top of each other, almost centered.  The centered mint marks, when they're repunched like this, they are kind of hard to identify.  And if your coin's worn or has obtained a lot of dye wear from the dye use, then you're sometimes going to run into kind of looking like it's repunched when it's not.  That's why it's important when you're looking at these to identify the dye marks besides the mint mark.  If you just look at the mint mark, you're kind of doing yourself a disservice because you want to look at all the other areas of the coin that help identify it as the RPM.  That's what's important here.  Here's another one.  It's a 74D.  And this is the double die verse on this one.  And on this one, it shows you there's a little more thickness of the letter.  One thing to remember about RPMs and double dies, they can be to the west, east, south, or north.  They can be any directions.  And that's one of the key things here.  Double dies are going to be in one direction.  In other words, you're looking for a thickness or spreading in a certain direction.  When you're seeing it on all sides of the devices, that's strike doubling or mechanical doubling.  It's not going to be on all sides.  The other thing is about mint.  marks are the same way.  North, south, east and west.  That first mint mark was hand punched on there weakly or in a different position or horizontally.  the next mint mark punched on there correctly.  So you're going to have a certain direction.  And that's one of the important things here you want to see.  If you're seeing what looks like a mint mark all around the outside of the mint mark that's already there, then you know that's probably dye wear and that's probably not an RPM.  And this one here will go to, this is a 1974, and this is D with an RPM.  And you can see just a little bit of a bump here.  This one here is probably going to be hard to identify.  There are some die marks on the reverse that you want to look for.  And that will help you ID it.  You know, sometimes the coins can be so circulated you can't identify some of these RPMs.  And that's one of the problems people run into.  And really, they're not worth a whole lot.  So if you really can't identify it, it's not going to be worth trying to put too much time in it.  You want to move on to the next coin.  Move on to the better coins.  Here's a 75.  And this is another double die.  This one We've got the little bit of the previous punch D right here at the bottom.  Here's some of the die marks to identify it with.  And moving on to... Here's the 1976 double-die verse.  It's known for extra thickness of the letters and liberty and of the date.  In God we trust, we... As you can see, when you look down through here, you want to identify the die marks, as I say before.  You have to identify the die marks.  It has to look like this coin.  Here's a 1977D with RPM.  And this one here has worn down a little bit, but you can still see just a little bit.  But there is a 1977 double die.  It was on, I believe, Konica Variety Vista.  I don't have a lot of information or an image for you on that one.  I'm sorry.  There are some of these I don't have.  They're not real popular.  When they're not real obvious or don't get nicknames and things like that, they tend to not be popular when it comes to varieties.  Double Dyes in itself is going to be worth a little bit of a premium anyways, but they're not always rare and they're not always exciting to some people.  Certain dates, they just get the press and the collectors and they're just a little more rare and collectors just want them and that gives them the value.  Here is 1978D and as you can see, and I'm going to give you an example, you have one, two, three, four, five.  On coppercoins.com has five.  Konica may have some more listed that's not listed here.  Okay, because all these lists are not exhaustive.  These are to give you an example.  You know, you're to do a little bit of research when you think you found something.  But all of these have a little link down here, MDS, MDS, that's mid die stage, late die stage.  What you want to do is you click on that and you identify the die markers.  But yeah, you can see the values here.  They're not worth a lot of money, but I mean, they're worth finding.  Bragging rights, you've got one for each date and mint for 1970s.  You can find a double die for almost every single date and mint in the 1970s.  Almost goes for every single date and mint for the entire Lincoln Scent series.  There's going to be some minor double die or an RPM for the ones with the mint marks.  Here's 1979.  Do have the RPMs listed, and as you can see, there's three of them.  Don't have a picture for one of them.  And this is the way it is.  It's an ongoing process.  It's an ongoing learning process.  You know, we never know it all about these coins.  There was billions and billions minted.  And no one person can go through all of them in their lifetime.  And it takes a group effort to find all these new varieties and identify them and catalog them.  And sometimes you've got different die stages, like I told you before.  But anyways, like I said, This list is not exhaustive by any means.  Hopefully you was able to learn something from it, learn how to identify some of your double dies.  I would really enjoy you guys to join my forum, Coin Help Community at coinoptionshelp.com and post your finds.  I would love to see you guys find some stuff and I'd love to see your RPMs and maybe you'll find a new discovery, you just never know.  So thanks for watching.
