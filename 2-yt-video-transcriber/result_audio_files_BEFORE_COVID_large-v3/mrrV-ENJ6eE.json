I think it was elongated purposely to protect people in the Obama Justice Department and FBI and Rod Rosenstein.  We shall see what is revealed about it.  And more importantly, what happens next, which is to what extent the current attorney general will authorize grand juries to investigate the FISA abuses and also the.  unmasking and the leaking of highly classified national security information during, pardon me, after the president's inauguration.  This is not over as far as holding accountable DOJ and FBI.  They are at this point still unrepentant.  Pardon me.  And they have not recuperated from their downfall. ",

Adam Schiff and Mark Warner, who have gone on television and saying there's ample evidence for these charges, will there be a reckoning against these politicians who have been saying one thing in the media when they're in the Gang of Eight?

You'll recall he made jokes about classified information and leaks at a fundraising party.  Adam Schiff is, of course, nothing more than an unhinged screwball who sees himself as a presidential candidate through this lens.  No, they will not be held accountable.  and indeed all the people in the media who have propagated this false story.  We'll move on to Jerry Nadler and Schiff and others in an effort to destroy this president.  But I have news for them.  This president is not going to be destroyed.  He's going to be stronger as a result of this.  And he's going to win in 2020 and just make their lives miserable.  And he's going to put at least one more justice on the Supreme Court. ",

So what exists now is a regulation in the Justice Department which provides only for a confidential report showing what cases Mueller indicted and what cases he did not indict and why.
