Because I remember reading the Constitution and it does talk about impeachment.  Yeah, it does.  Although it mentions impeachment a lot with judges as well.  So impeachment certainly is part of the process and it's actually not even a new thought in America because there have been presidents who have been impeached. ",

This is a document from 1867 on a presidential impeachment.  President Andrew Johnson.  Now, he was impeached in 1868.  And this is part of the legal inquiry into what can you impeach him for, what do you do with impeachment, what does it take to be a high crime and misdemeanor, which is what the Constitution says you use to impeach someone.  And so it goes through, and we've had not only President Andrew Johnson, by the way, he was impeached but not convicted, because in the Constitution it's a multi-step process.  You have, first of all, the House of Representatives has to bring a bill of impeachment.  That's kind of like a grand jury giving an indictment.  Grand jury's looked at it and say, hey, we think there's enough here to have a trial for this guy.  And that's what the House does.  So a majority of the House will vote and say, we think we should impeach President Trump for whatever.  Then it goes over to the Senate, and the Senate becomes the jury.  So the 100 senators, and it is not Mitch McConnell in charge of the trial.  You bring in the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to sit in the Senate, and both sides present their evidence, and the Senate all listens, just like they're a jury, and then they will vote guilty or innocent, except in the Senate...

            "text": "And historically, so you had Bill Clinton who also was someone who was impeached in the House but didn't get anything done over in the Senate.  Well, then you had people like Nixon who Nixon was in some trouble and they were bringing up the impeachment and before they had the chance to impeach him, he resigned.  precedent is presidents have been impeached, but no one has ever been thrown out of office because there's never been enough in the Senate to actually do something with this.  And this is kind of where we are today, where you have a political majority in the House, you have the opposite in the Senate.  And so even if this happens in the House, you're not going to get two thirds of the Senate at this point.  But this is kind of the history we see in the nation where sometimes you have a majority in the House who doesn't like the political position of the other party president.  and therefore they want to stop them.  So what do we do?  We don't like them.  Let's impeach them.  Now, the founding fathers put this in place so that there could be a check and balance.  So if you had a president who was going crazy, doing things that were wrong, you could put a stop to that.  However, they did define as high crimes and misdemeanors.  So it can't just be, we don't like the guy.  There does have to be some criminal process along the way, which of course there've been a lot of accusations, but until something is proven, you don't really have a good reason Criminally speaking, to impeach him, although the House can try, it's up to the Senate to convict.
