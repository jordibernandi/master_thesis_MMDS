            "text": "Hey family, how you doing?  Welcome to, well, I don't really have a name for it just yet.  Frank.  Frank via YouTube channel.  Frank via YouTube channel.  Channel 26.  Look at this.  If you look real careful, it's very sharp.  In fact, this can actually cut me, but look at how it's so resilient to the wind.  that amazing this is why they call it the hula.  and then of course as it's cut and trimmed off look at you see this.  yeah it's being trimmed off and you you have the the core of the trunk that's left behind.  it's actually not a tree it's a plant isn't that amazing?  and here of course it's going to slowly break off and be like this These are the seeds.  These are the seeds.  If you look real careful, this is a giant mosquito.  Can you see it right there?  That's a giant mosquito.  Isn't that cool?  But these seeds are actually good.  They're edible.  And there's a pod that comes out.  It's a black pod.  And they're very fashionable here in Hawaii.  You can wear these as earrings.  There you go.  This is the new style here in Hawaii.  But they're actually sweet.  They're edible.  Inside, you see that?  It's like brown sugar.  You can see the sap coming out.  Almost looks like meat.  The chicken mother.  Yeah, caramel taste.  So, I invite you to Frank 26 U2 Champ.  I'd like to see if we can have attendance.  They say that if I get to a certain amount of views, Then I can bring in even more.  My intentions are to talk to you just as Frank.  Maybe on Mondays we'll do a cooking show.  You got a little taste of my cooking show.  Maybe on Tuesdays a Bible study.  Maybe on Wednesdays we can talk about UFOs.  I don't know.  We'll come up with something, okay?  I'd like to talk to you also about my products.  You know I bring you certain products because I use them, I test them, I try them for at least anywhere from three to six months.  If I feel that they're beneficial, I bring them to you.  Maybe some infomercials.  I can produce about 100 of them because there's hundreds of products that we represent.  Anyways, I just wanted to say hi and welcome you to Frank26's YouTube channel.  This is Hawaii.  where paradise is found once again.  Please come back and see me again.  I'll do this on a daily basis, so we can build a base.  Aloha naka'a.  Thank you. ",
