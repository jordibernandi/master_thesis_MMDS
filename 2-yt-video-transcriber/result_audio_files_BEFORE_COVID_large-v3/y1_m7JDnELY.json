We are gonna destroy this fucking town!  You may be wondering who that sad, fragile piece of human garbage shouting racial slurs is.  That would be Richard Spencer, well-known white nationalist and Nazi.  Now, you may be wondering why I showed it to you.  Well, that would be because the day after that clip was released by Milo Yiannopoulos, Lauren Chen found herself being questioned on Twitter for her irresponsible platforming of, and defense of, Richard Spencer.  Apparently, advocating for an ethnostate wasn't enough of a red flag for Lauren to realize that she was dealing with a Nazi, and she was immediately called out by ContraPoints for her interview, which is a generous term for just letting Richard come on your rather large platform and spew his dogshit ideology, which led to Chen talking with Contra about it.  That interview has been set to enlisted... and I can't for the life of me understand why, but I was able to watch it, and I'm going to share a couple of clips from it, as well as talk about other ways that Lauren Chen enables white supremacists.  Let's jump in. ",

In a way, what it is is worse, which is a platform for the kind of euphemisms in which hate promotes itself.  So Richard Spencer, I mean, he has, you have to admit, he has a talent for kind of making this all seem very reasonable and relatable and the kind of thing that a hipster in Brooklyn could get on board with.  And like, So to me, it's the propaganda, the public relations version of it.  In a way, it would be better if you had someone who just came on and was like, I want to kill the Jews.  Because that person, I think most people can recognize, okay, I don't agree with that.  But it's the kind of sneaking in of the idea through this relatable persona and through ideas that seem on the face value potentially reasonable to a lot of people.  So again, to me, what's dangerous about it is that I think that... Richard Spencer has a talent for presenting these ideas in a way that make them seem like they're sort of within the realm of what could be reasonably discussed, when if you saw what I think is the actual Legenda would be repellent.  So it's the kind of normalizing and the kind of sort of making much more palatable something that to most people, you know, in its most brute form is very unpalatable.  that I think is dangerous. ",

Like, you said stuff that I didn't have as much of a problem as I otherwise might have.  Like, well, maybe that's actually his opinion.  And maybe, you know, all the extreme rhetoric about him actually being a literal Nazi, maybe that was what was incorrect.  And again... I can't know what's in his heart.  I can't know what he really means to do.  But the idea that it was worse than giving a platform to hate because his views weren't that crazy or didn't come across as that crazy.  I mean, that's a that's a criticism that I'm not really even sure how to, you know, how to how to respond to.

It's ridiculous to imagine that could be done peacefully, and it's obvious as hell that you're dealing with a Nazi.  At the very very least, you should be asking him how he intends to achieve his goals and force him to confront the inevitable consequences of his ideology.  And I know some people, despite the first clip I showed in this video and the obvious link between Spencer, white nationalism, and Nazism, are still going to object to me using the word Nazi, but in this specific instance, it is more than reasonable to apply it to Richard Spencer.  It's reasonable now, and it was reasonable in 2017 when this discussion took place.  Especially when you have footage like this taken in 2016. ",

Contra trying to point out that interviewing Spencer isn't the real issue, but the way in which Lauren did it irresponsibly, by allowing Richard to just spew his propaganda unopposed, was.  And Lauren just making excuses for her failure as an interviewer to push back against very little.  if anything the white nationalist had to say to her and her hundred plus thousand subscribers.  Lauren just continually says that she couldn't possibly know what was in Richard Spencer's heart, even though he was on record calling for a white ethnostate long before this interview ever took place.  I also couldn't help but notice that Lauren had no issues pushing back hard against ContraPoints, but spent next to no time pushing back against Spencer.  In my last video in which Lauren Chen endorsed destruction of property and theft using Christianity, I took a little bit of flak for pointing out that the thumbnail included the phrase, and how scholars have pointed out that it's routinely used by racist white nationalists.  However, just the other day, Lauren came out as a Christian nationalist.  If the name doesn't give it away, you might be wondering what that is.  It turns out that Christian nationalism, and those who espouse it... tend to scare even other Christians.  For example, in July of 2019, a group of Christian leaders wrote a letter condemning Christian nationalism.  In part, it read, quote, Christian nationalism seeks to merge Christian and American identities, distorting both the Christian faith and America's constitutional democracy.  Christian nationalism demands Christianity be privileged by the state and implies that to be a good American, one must be Christian.  It often overlaps with and provides cover for white supremacy and racial subjugation.  We reject this damaging political ideology and invite our Christian brothers and sisters to join us in opposing this threat to our faith and to our nation.  End quote.  She has also signal boosted other white nationalists such as Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern and has pushed other white nationalist talking points such as cultural Marxism. ",

But this whole story of group identity and oppressor versus oppressed is entirely in keeping with the historical interpretation found in the Communist Manifesto.  If you haven't yet read the Communist Manifesto, I really recommend you do.  It's a short read.  It shouldn't take you longer than about 15 minutes.  You can find it for free online, and it'll give you so much insight into how these people think.  While Marx lamented about the injustices of the bourgeoisie, the SJWs complain about the patriarchy.  They are two sides of the same oppressive coin.  Of course, what these similarities mean is that the same arguments of liberty and individualism that can be used to debunk the Marxist worldview can also be used against the social justice worldview.

They were all either dupes of the Communists that lay behind them or wittingly doing their dirty work of spreading secretly and in the schools and in the films and in the museums this kind of evil Bolshevism.

She's a woman and she's part Chinese, neither of which fit in with a white nationalist ideal view of the world.  Sure, they'll grow and use her platform for as long as it seems useful to do so, but as soon as she questions them or they feel as if they no longer need her platform, they'll turn on her.
