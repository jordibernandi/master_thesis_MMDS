DNA is more advanced than any software ever created.  Think about it.  A program or code is written by someone very smart.  The more complex the code, the more intelligent the author has to be.  So here's the question.  If our DNA code is more complex than any man-made software, where did it come from?  Is it possible it was authored without an author, programmed without a program?  Materialists think so, through neo-Darwinism, the modern version of Darwinian evolution.  Stephen Meyer, author of the New York Times bestseller, Darwin's Doubt, explains. ",

That's part of what we know from our observation of the world around us, that information always arises from an intelligent source.
