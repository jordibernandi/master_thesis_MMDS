Check, check, check, check, check.  We're doing all those things, and instead of saying, hey, this is really something that maybe we should get behind, instead they're saying, oh my gosh, there's something very suspicious and weird about her because she's actually stealing voters from Trump.

So, you know, whatever the smears are, however radical they are, it shows me that they feel threatened and they are concerned about the unifying message that I'm bringing, because we have Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, independents who are joining this coalition that is fueling our campaign.  That's actually speaking the truth.  That's calling for an end to these regime change wars, calling for, you know, a de-escalation of tensions between the United States and other nuclear armed countries and end to this new Cold War nuclear arms race.  Actually, hey, let's focus our limited taxpayer dollars on actually serving the needs of our people.  That's really the message that we're bringing and it scares the hell out of them. ",
