So we live, obviously, in a different country now.  And I say that literally.  This United States today, 2019, is not the way it was in the late 60s, early 70s.  There is no civility anymore.  There's no Sam Ervin.  Sam Ervin would be called a bad name now if he were walking around.  So Schiff is a guy, he is what I call a political assassin, right?  He's not a congressman.  He gets elected.  But his job is to assassinate people verbally or legally, whatever it is.  It's not to be reasonable.  It's not to search for the truth.  It's not to improve the country.  All right.  Everyone should know that.  So Schiff basically says, look, this is a charade.  We, Nancy Pelosi, myself, Nadler, everybody, we know there's not going to be any conviction in the Senate.  We know that.  But in conjunction with the New York Times, Washington Post, NBC, and CNN, we're going to hoist a scenario on the American people, and that scenario is that this man, President Trump, is, quote, unquote, not fit to serve.  So we're going to get the Russian collusion thing up and running.  Oh, well, it didn't work, but two years, two years of smearing Trump every day.  Now we've got to get something new.  So now we've got impeachment.  Abuse of power.  I wrote a little mini-column in BillOReilly.com that said, if abuse of power is the standard of impeachment, then every single president since Washington could be impeached.  And I gave examples, even Abraham Lincoln.  could have been preached for suspending habeas corpus.  so anyway you've got a situation where it's all about messaging.  so she says we don't really want everybody to hear and see what the impeachment situation is.  we don't want that because there really isn't anything don't really have a crime here.  so we're going to have secret secret conversations uh... in our committee and then we'll leak them To the New York Times and Washington Post, they'll put him on page one.  And there'll be so much damage done that people will either walk away from Trump or he'll implode.  That's another thing that people don't talk about.  They're trying to put so much pressure on Trump that he's going to implode emotionally.  Because we know that we can't beat Trump in the next election as it stands now.  There's not one Democrat in the field that can beat him.  so we've got to destroy them before we get to election day.  two thousand twenty and therein lies the answer to your question. ",

You know as an American that half of the country wants him impeached, but the other half will say, if you impeach this guy, especially with secret testimony and everything else, it's a banana republic.  And the other half of the country won't stand.  Everything they seem to be doing just seems to be poking people in the eye.  The top two reasons that Americans give for civil war Violation of the Second Amendment.  They're all over that.  They're actually saying we'll come with cops to your house to take your guns.  The second one is impeachment for a president that doesn't look like he should be impeached or if there's secret meetings,  etc.,  etc.  They're riding on both of those.  So they know that.
