            "text": "First up, we're going to talk about character jokes.  Now what I mean is that these jokes are jokes that are only funny because of the personality of the character telling the joke.  As an audience, we find them funny because they're so on-brand for that character and because the actor or actress for that role is so great at portraying that character.  Jake Peralta is a perfect example of this.  He's essentially the main character of the show, and a lot of the jokes are built around Andy Samberg's comedic talent and hilarious facial expressions.  Say it.  Say, my favorite movie is Failure to Launch.  Jake's character is immature, stubborn, and headstrong, but also brave, kind-hearted, and selfless.  A lot of his jokes revolve around his inability to function like a normal adult. ",

Either there's a lot of, ugh, I'm going to be tied down now kind of jokes, or the show takes on a more serious tone around the relationship.  Now, Brooklyn Nine-Nine definitely takes on a more serious tone at times in regards to Jake and Amy's relationship, but it never stoops to the level of having Jake complain about his relationship for laughs, like so many other shows would do.  In fact, it does the opposite.

It would be really easy for the show to go for the, uh, the old ball and chain is dragging me down jokes, but it doesn't, and I think that can be a model for how other comedies should look to get laughs out of a relationship without putting anyone down.  Speaking of which, Brooklyn Nine-Nine has a pretty good habit in general of punching up, not down.  If you haven't heard of that phrase before, it basically means that in comedy, you want to be punching up at the people in charge, the oppressors, the people with power.  You don't want to be punching down at the marginalized people, the people without power.  When you punch up at the powerful, you challenge the status quo.  You make people think about things in a way they may not have before.  When you punch down at the powerless, you're simply doing what the powerful have been doing for a long time.  You become a part of the status quo, reinforcing old stereotypes and prejudices.  Good comedy knows how to punch up.  Bad comedy continues to punch down.  That doesn't mean your comedy has to be political.  Lots of people go to comedy to get away from the misery of day-to-day politics.  But it does mean that your jokes exist in this current world, and you need to be aware of the environment you're saying them in, and the effect they will have on people.  Punching down ends up being just as political as punching up.  You're just swinging at the wrong people.  And Brooklyn Nine-Nine, for the most part, seems to recognize that.  For an example, let's talk about the three times trans people have been mentioned in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  In the beginning of season 4, when Jake and Holt are stuck in witness protection in Florida, they're trying to track down someone who got an embarrassing video of them and could potentially blow their cover.  When Jake shows the local tattoo artist the photo they have of the person they're looking for, the tattoo artist says that the person is wearing a ring from San Marino High, and mentions that their mascot was the pet detectives from Ace Ventura.  So Jake says this. ",

It defies your expectations, but at the same time it stands up for trans people.  Trans people aren't the butt of the joke here, like they are on so many other shows.  Jake's right, the end of Ace Ventura is extremely transphobic, and that one little line about it is both funny and a perfect example of punching up.  The butt of the joke here is transphobes, or that one piece of transphobic media.  This joke challenges the status quo.  Later, there's an episode where Jake and Amy are trying to babysit Terry's kids and failing because the kids keep asking hard questions like, did their dad get in trouble with the police just because he's black?

Trust me, I'm pretty much used to having to put up with at least a few transphobic jokes in most forms of media.  But instead of taking a cheap jab at trans people, Brooklyn Nine-Nine used it as a really thoughtful moment to tell people that actually, their gender can be whatever they experience it as.  That wasn't the focus of the episode, and they pivot away from the topic immediately, but it's a really nice thing to say, and I was really proud of Brooklyn Nine-Nine for doing that.  And lastly, in the fifth season, there's an episode where Jake is in prison and talking to the warden about possibly becoming a snitch for him.  Initially, he doesn't want to, and this is what happens. ",

            "text": "This joke breaks the flow of the conversation they were having and, again, defies your expectations.  They're having a heated, fast-paced back-and-forth where they can't agree, and then suddenly both of them slow down and recognize how hard it is in prison for trans people.  Then they resume their discussion.  It's funny because of how it breaks up their conversation, but it's also funny in like a morbid, oh sh**, that's right kind of way.  Trans people being in jail isn't the butt of the joke.  The system that put them there is.  Again, it's a small thing, but any other show would have used this opportunity to make some terrible joke about trans people in prison.  And Brooklyn Nine-Nine not only avoided that, but also pointed out how our society has failed trans people in that regard.  That being said, while Brooklyn Nine-Nine does typically punch up, it definitely doesn't always do that, and with a couple of characters, it pretty consistently punches down.  You may have noticed I didn't talk about Scully and Hitchcock in the beginning with the other characters, and there was a reason for that.  Both of these characters' jokes are pretty consistently not great.  I'm gonna put a content warning here for fatphobia and sexual harassment, and if you'd like to skip this section, I'd suggest pausing right now.  And I'll put timestamps in the description so you can go past this part.  I think it's important to talk about this stuff, but I also understand if you can't right now.  So, with Scully, the joke is almost always that he's fat.  There are countless jokes about his health issues because, haha, he's fat and unhealthy?  Type 3 and type 9 and 12 and 13.  Those are all the diabeteses I  have.\".  Like, what the f*** even is this joke?  It's funny because he's listing off multiple kinds of diabetes he has?  And that's funny because he's fat?  I genuinely don't get where the humor is supposed to be in this.  Why punch down at people with diabetes or fat people?  What does that achieve besides reinforcing the status quo?  And the show has countless Scully jokes just like this one, where they conflate being fat with being unhealthy and consistently make him the butt of the joke.  Fat people deserve respect and kindness, just like anyone else.  And I'm so tired of seeing ha ha it's funny because they eat food and they're fat jokes.  They're tired.  They've been done for decades.  Find better jokes.  Let fat people be in roles where they aren't constantly the butt of the joke.  Despite how much I love Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I feel like it has really messed up in this department, and I think that's worth acknowledging and asking them to do better.  Then there's Hitchcock.  His jokes are basically one of three things.  He's bleeding for no reason, he's tasting something he shouldn't be tasting, or he's sexually harassing women. ",

            "text": "I'll check again.  I've never seen him walk with such purpose.  What a wretched man.  What part of that is funny?  It's funny that all of these characters just tolerate a coworker who consistently harasses his female coworkers and makes inappropriate comments about them.  And Brooklyn Nine-Nine knows that he's that kind of character, because when they did a Me Too episode, they literally wrote him out of the entire episode.  Holt just told him to go home.  And the thing is, I liked that episode, but I think it's a tad hypocritical to have an episode revolve around Me Too while ignoring the character in your main cast who really should have been fired by now.  There's even a scene where Rosa spikes Jake's water with caffeine when they're both competing to get a spot on Hawkins' team.  During that cutaway, Hitchcock looks over and winks at her.  Given how Hitchcock's entire character is based around sexually harassing women, what are we as an audience supposed to gleam from that moment?  Because the only thing I can think of is that it's implying that Hitchcock himself has drugged and assaulted someone, or he's at least happy about the prospect of other people doing that.  Because he doesn't know she's lacing it with caffeine.  With everything we know about his character, I can't think of a less vile explanation for that wink.  Honestly, if you took Scully and Hitchcock out of the show entirely, you'd solve a lot of its problems really quickly.  Unfortunately, it seems like they're around to stay.  And while that sucks, I'm going to continue watching and loving Brooklyn Nine-Nine, because there are so many other positive aspects to it.  If I refused to watch any show that had hurtful jokes or storylines in it, I would literally never watch anything.  All the media we consume has both good and bad in it, and I think we can appreciate the good while also criticizing the bad.  The point of this video is not that Brooklyn Nine-Nine is perfect or terrible.  I think Brooklyn Nine-Nine can be an amazing show and have some very bad aspects to it.  The point of this video is that, aside from a couple exceptions, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is generally really good at making jokes, and I wanted to analyze what made it so funny in the first place.  To recap, there are character jokes built around solid acting and good, contrasting character traits.  Then there are your usual crude jokes and funny situation jokes.  Then there are jokes that defy your expectations but don't neatly fit into any of the other categories.  Then there's the positive relationship jokes, where relationships are joked about in a positive manner rather than a negative one.  And lastly, we have jokes that punch up and jokes that punch down.  Brooklyn Nine-Nine tells jokes in all of these ways, but it's the first six categories that make it such a hilarious show.  By the time this video goes live, Brooklyn Nine-Nine will just be wrapping up its sixth season, but it has been renewed by NBC for a seventh season, which I'm super thankful for.  I'm excited to see where the Nine-Nine is headed for the next season.  Thanks so much for watching this video.
