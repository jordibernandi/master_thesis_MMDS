While at the same time they're telling us that we're in a post-racial society, we keep seeing things like this happen.  I'm going to roll a video clip where a white woman with a gun basically tells a black couple who are walking their dog that they have to leave the campground.  Now this is down in Mississippi, y'all.  Down in Mississippi.  So I'm gonna go ahead and roll the clip and I will be right back. ",

            "text": "Now, as you see, yet another one of these incidents, this time it's an older Becky who was telling a young black couple, one of which is in the military, the husband is in the military, over there defending this country.  And he comes back here, as he stated, he says, I don't get a gun pointed in my face when I'm deployed, but I come here and that is what happens.  This story has been told so many times before, family.  are we getting the picture?  yet?  we are in the land of our captivity in the land of our enemies the land of people that hate us.  okay and so the story kind of grows old in one sense but in another sense you say to yourself will people ever really truly realize what is happening?  because You have many who continue to tell you that this is directly linked to something that is in them, that boils over in them.  It's called a perpetual hatred.  It was prophesied that they would have this perpetual hatred against us.  That is what we see happening.  And many of us just seem to be clueless about as to why this is happening.  and this is why we talk about these things because it has been prophesied that they would have a perpetual hatred for us and they don't even know why.  Now, I have a sneaking suspicion that had an Asian couple came on there walking their dog She wouldn't have responded that way.  And I'll take it a step further.  I'll even say an Arab couple or a Latino couple.  There is a specific type of hatred that the world has for the tribe of Judah.  And it bubbles over in them to the point where they can't help it.  This couple look very harmless.  They're walking a dog.  They just look like a regular, nice, not nice.  Let me take that word back.  Kind, young, black couple.  But in her wicked mind, the mind of this woman, she wanted them out of there.  And so as the wife stated, she said that they were treating her just like they were dogs.  Treating them like they were dogs.  Saying, get, get, you don't belong here.  What that is in them, because the couple didn't do anything wrong, they didn't even look threatening.  What that is, is that perpetual hatred that's in them that they can't help it.  They have the.  I can't help it.  And no, I am not making an excuse for them.  I am trying to articulate to you that it is in them.  It is embedded in their psyche, in their minds, in their hearts, in their system.  They can't stand you.  When she saw them, only hate came to mind.  And she didn't like what she saw.  The sight of them irked her to the point where she had to pull out her weapon.  And if she could have, I bet this woman would have shot both of them dead.  That is the type of wickedness that boils over in these racist people.  Now, what I find amazing, I find this interesting.  I've said many times on my channel, on various videos, that if this is not talking about you, if it doesn't describe you, then why do you get offended when I talk about these things?  Right now I'm talking to other white people.  Okay, I have a Gentile that sends me messages from time to time.  And when I referenced this person at 119 Ministries and other people who think like him, I was talking about racist people.  And I basically said that you're acting like the devil or you're the devil, you're of the devil.  Now, when I say those things, I am fully aware Excuse me.  I am fully aware that there are so-called black people who act like the devil, too.  But when I am talking about issues dealing with racism and other topics such as denying our heritage and all these other things, and the subject is about white people, I don't have to say that, oh, and black people, too.  Because I am fully aware, if you follow this channel, if you've heard me speak before, then you know that I know and understand that enemies come in black and white.  And that black people as well as white people can act just like the devil.  So when you people get offended and you get upset or you even question why I'm saying certain things, it just kind of that bothers me and it irks me.  Although you can do whatever you want to do, you can question whatever you want to, but I can also speak about these issues if I want to as well.  Okay.  Sometimes you may get offended by some things, but it is what it is.  The truth remains that we see these incidents happening and all we hear is silence coming from so-called white people on the things that they constantly do.  But they want to keep in our remembrance the things that we do.  I find that very, very hypocritical and funny because if you want to be fair, be fair.  Wickedness comes in all colors, all nations, all of it.  And this woman at the campground, she definitely describes one of those who is just pure evil and of the devil.  For her to see this young couple and just... act and behave this way shows that she is out of touch, out of balance, that she is probably a reprobate, okay?  It is what it is.  I'm going to keep on moving from here, okay?  When these subjects come up, if I feel inclined to speak about them, then I will.  If I don't, then I won't.  But I just thought I would talk about this.  It was shared with me um by brother jamar.  thank you very much for sharing the story with me because uh these things are going to continue to happen as long as we're in the land of our captivity and people choose to stay and remain blind.  okay these things will continue to happen but i want you to understand that the reason they are happening is because people in this world are not connecting to the voice of the Most High YAH.  They do not fear YAH, so wickedness continues to spring forth, and it continues to spin out of control.  Okay?  With that, I will say Shalom.
