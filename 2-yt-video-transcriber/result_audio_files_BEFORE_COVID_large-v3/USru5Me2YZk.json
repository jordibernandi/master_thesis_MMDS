            "text": "I had Casey move his own body weight so he can establish a correlation between what he's accomplished already and what he can expect himself to do in the future.  Good, nice.  Good, just knees up high.  Good, keep fighting.  That was almost a life-ending event.  Failing by the time.  season two, episode five recap.  You gotta be so good that they can't ignore you.  Especially the ones that ain't done shit for you.  Yeah, you know exactly what I mean.  They stab you in the back and then they ask why you bleed.  I don't trust words.  I trust action.  I don't care what you heard.  I'm not slacking.  My name is Alan Roberts.  This is Everyday Update Fitness.  Like, subscribe, click the notification button over here, and share my videos.  Thank you very much.  Subscribe to my second channel, Alan Roberts.  And my opinion, of course, is going to be linked above and below at the end and all the places you would find a second link channel.  So please share those videos too.  Thank you very much.  Just for my normal audience, this is going to be a no swearing video.  I'm going to try very, very, very hard.  And the reason why I do that, just to explain why I do that to everybody, when I'm talking about something I believe that I am... hoping will help as many people as possible in the face of our obesity epidemic, I try to make it so it can be shared and viewed by everybody.  I know that in my own language, oftentimes, I swear a lot, and I do want everybody to understand that I don't normally care to filter myself in a certain way, but when I'm trying to get a point delivered to as many people as humanly possible, because I believe that it is actually an important aspect of what can actually help people in the future, I do try to tone it down, and this is one of those videos.  That was Casey in the very opening segment from the show Family by the Ton.  Family by the Ton is a show that I think should be watched by everybody as we are in the throes of an obesity epidemic.  It should be on every network.  It is on the TLC network, however.  It is on Wednesday nights.  And the final episode for the King family for this season is going to be on tonight.  I don't know if they're going to come back next season as a recap, but the rest of the season is going to be a recap on the family from last season, which I actually need to watch.  Last season, as this is the first time I've been exposed to this show, this show has shown me many things.  It's actually helped me evolve my opinion on gastric bypass surgery.  I used to believe that it just shouldn't be done, that people should develop the willpower to treat their food addictions, which is anybody that has 400, 500, 600 pounds of weight on them does have a food addiction.  It just is what it is.  However, I do now realize that it... it can buy them a little bit of extra time to do so, because when you get to be 700 pounds, death is imminent.  And that was Casey.  Casey started the show, the opening clip, he started the show at about a little over 700 pounds.  And I wanted to use this episode to talk about several things, like the progress that they're having, but also highlight what it's like to work out as a very, very, very obese person.  So, as you can see, Casey started working out.  So like, how do you feel about your body?  i mean i'm fat so i'm.  i feel tired already but i mean i'm okay.  i have a little more energy than a person.  my size probably should okay but um i do swim more occasionally.  like this is my.  this will be my first day here but i swam monday and wednesday okay so i feel like i'm doing more.  i'm trying to even make sure i'm eating right.  sounds to me like you're ready to work now.  this young man has seemed very hesitant about the entire surgery thing the entire time he did have his dog pass away.  in this episode they highlighted that That might have been an event that made him think, well, I need to make a change.  I do hope so.  I hope nothing but the absolute best for all of these people.  I really do.  I truly do.  Living in the prison of obesity has got to be horrible.  The isolation these people must go through.  Again, that's why a lot of times whole families are obese together is because It's a normalization of that type of weight and that type of eating behavior and everything like that so they're able to feel comfortable.  But it is isolating in a way that most people don't understand.  It is probably the worst addiction there is.  I've talked about that many, many times.  In this show, this entire family is getting gastric bypass surgeries because Casey, I believe, was the biggest one, a little over 700 pounds.  Amanda, who was the first one to get her surgery, was in the mid-600s and has to lose about 300 pounds in order to have surgery to remove cancer from herself.  And that is actually a true thing.  I've actually heard people say that that's discriminatory, like it's fat phobic or fat shaming.  or when your doctor says you need to lose weight because of this, that, and the other thing, or people are denied surgeries because of their weight.  You're denied surgeries because you're mega obese because the likelihood of you making it off the table is so little.  things like anesthesia how you know if they have to tilt your body back to get you at certain angles how the fat will distribute and help and crush your organs especially for men because men carry a lot of visceral fat which is fat around the organs.  it is those sorts of things that like people need to understand.  this is not a shaming thing like.  I believe that the concept that we have of you know fat acceptance and you know you know basically trying to normalize normalized obesity are killing people, and this family's a perfect example.  Many of these people are on death's door.  The second person to get the surgery was Amy, Amy seems to be doing very, very well.  She started training with her father to run a Spartan race.  She had her surgery.  She's lost about 20 pounds since her surgery, which is awesome.  Congratulations.  You're doing excellent.  She's in the, you know, in like the 330s area now, down from like 380-something when the show started, which is amazing.  It's truly, it's excellent, excellent, excellent progress.  And she's training to do a Spartan race with her father.  And by the way, Dad... I'm a fan.  You're amazing.  You really, really are.  I do have a few tips on the workouts for obese people, and that's what we're going to talk about in this show because I'm trying to use this show to highlight little things about obesity and the obesity epidemic and things for obese people to possibly look at.  And then Ed, who is a retired firefighter, he retired at 51 due to his obesity, retired firefighter, got his surgery last week and seems to be doing well, and I hope Ed nothing but the best too.  Ed is doing this to be a good example to his children, which I salute in a great way, and I hope you nothing but the best.  And Casey is the last one that we don't even know if he's getting the surgery yet or not because that's not released.  I have actually sent messages back and forth with Casey online as I believe he took a few things I had to say wrong.  And I have no problem addressing my stances on things.  And I wish him nothing but the best too.  And I do think that his dog passing away got him into the gym.  It was kind of a life-altering thing for him.  And I can totally understand.  I love my animals.  And I believe that this is a good path for him.  It's a positive move forward.  In previous episodes, he did not appear ready for the surgery.  He looked like he was trying to find every excuse to not change his behavior.  And who would want to?  because, very frankly, he doesn't see the imminent threat to his life, which at 700 pounds, you've got about a couple years to live at most.  He is catered to most of his life by his enablers, and he sits and plays video games most of the day.  Now, granted, that's isolating, but it still is very comfortable.  He has to go through very little discomfort.  In this episode, it does show him putting himself in some discomfort, which makes me happy.  Now, he does talk about he's swimming a couple days a week.  Very realistically, you should be swimming every chance you get.  You should live in that pool.  If you have the opportunity to, you should live in that pool.  You should be moving as much as humanly possible, especially in a pool.  If you have access to a pool and you're an obese person, the benefits are great.  They really, really are.  The first of all act of cleaning in between the folds is a very good thing, and that's not to be mean.  That's just reality.  And then besides that, it's the exercise that is low impact on your joints and on your system, which is a huge portion for obese people, what we're about to talk about.  In the opening clip.  the trainer who did an excellent job, who's doing an excellent job with Casey, who did state that this is the first time he's ever worked with somebody of Casey's size.  I thought he did an excellent job not making assumptions about Casey.  I think he did an excellent job trying to work to Casey's capabilities.  I believe he overestimated the possible capabilities and over and underestimated the amount of risk with some of these activities, which when you first start working with really, really, really obese people, definitely, definitely happens.  I've seen trainers make mistakes with really obese people everything from doing You know starting starting them off with barbell work all the way to unilateral work on bozu balls and stuff ridiculous stuff like that.  That is that that is very very risky.  as we saw in this opening clip Casey takes a misstep and what people do not understand about people of this size one misstep of that nature, he could have destroyed his ankle or destroyed his knee.  That is 700 pounds of force coming down on that leg, on those joints.  directly.  That is extremely, extremely dangerous.  If you're going to have anybody of that size do anything with step-ups, it should be a very low step because the idea is you just want the movement.  Their heart rate is going to get up no matter what.  In fact, I don't suggest that you train anybody that's that size without a heart rate monitor just to be monitoring that.  also because they are They could have a cardiac event at any time, at any time.  But if you're gonna train people of that size, heart monitor and super minimally low risk exercises designed for nothing but to get their heart rate up.  They are going to have progressive overload to build muscle just with their body weight and moving it more because nobody gets to be that size, 600, 700 pounds, Without some sort of sedentary aspect in their life, unless they're like some sort of sumo wrestler, unless it's on purpose.  When people accidentally get obese of this nature into the 4, 5, 600, 700 pound range, they are very sedentary.  So they are going to have progressive overload and build muscular tissue simply just from moving their own body weight more, even as their body weight goes down, even if it goes down in dramatic fashion.  So, what needs to happen is very minimally low-risk events.  Now, the show did show Amy using some kettlebells and stuff like that, but she is also down to the 330s.  She is training for Spartan Race.  The doctor cleared her, and I totally agree with that.  Dad's doing a good job, so if people are looking for like, well, what are you saying about the dad?  That's fine, and I'm not even knocking on the trainer.  I think he did a freaking awesome job, and it feels weird for me to say freaking, by the way.  I think you did an awesome job, but as to highlight for anybody that is very obese and you're starting to work out generally, get up and go.  Do what you can, but also keep in mind that you are in a medically compromised situation when it comes to your bone density, your joints, your connective tissue, those sorts of things.  Nothing is going to negatively impact your life faster if you're an obese person or if you're a trainer training obese people.  Nothing will impact them negatively faster than them spraining a knee, spraining an ankle, breaking an ankle, tearing a ligament in their knee, blowing a disc in their back.  Casey shouldn't be doing bent over rows with any weights in his hands.  He shouldn't.  He could just bend over and stand back up and the sheer weight of his upper body is going to be absolutely enough resistance on his barely used posterior chain up until now.  I hear all sorts of people say, well, they're huge, and every time they get up, it's like them deadlifting 700 pounds.  No, it's not.  And that's one of the reasons why they actually don't get up much, because of the weight.  But no, it's not.  If that's the case, that's one of the things I have my obese clients that I train in person do is very high box squats, very, very, very high box squats where they don't even get to 90 degrees at all, at all.  And when they sit down, it's very, very safe because they're not putting extra strain on their lower back.  They're not putting extra strain on their knees, on their ankles.  mobility is not even necessarily an issue.  while you're trying to get some weight off and then you work on the ability the idea is save their life first by removing as much of the excess fat as humanly possible.  i always tell people in training focus on one primary goal at a time.  the others will come up you know as they are like if a person is trying to lose weight they need to focus on losing that weight.  uh getting stronger will probably happen for most of these people because they haven't used their muscles or like that.  and while it may appear that they're not getting stronger because Frankly, I don't even have people use weight at that size yet.  If I do have them use weight, by the way, it is small hand weights and that is just for upper body movements and oftentimes just done while standing.  But somebody of Casey's size, I have had clients where we have literally started them with just chair yoga, like sitting in a chair and just doing yoga in a chair just to get their joints used to moving.  When they have poor nutrition, as anybody that's that size does, when they have poor nutrition and low activity, their bone density suffers also.  It is just a recipe for injury, and an injury at that size, anything that causes any type of immobility is nearly a death sentence.  It can result in further depression, which anybody that's 600 or 700 pounds has.  Five, 600, 700 pounds, they're depressed.  Period.  I don't think I'll ever be able to be convinced any differently.  Just hormonally, it's gotta be messing with their system, let alone being that big and realizing that you've done it to yourself.  The depression will make them eat more.  It will possibly trigger more.  They'll be bored because if they have a back injury, knee injury, leg injury, they're going to be sitting down a lot.  They're going to be very sedentary again.  So they'll be very, very bored.  And oftentimes people eat in boredom, especially food addicts.  And they will have almost no mobility.  They'll have almost no activity.  Therefore, they will not have an activity factor added onto their basal metabolic rate.  And thus, they will be again adding weight on.  And adding weight on when you're that size is very, very, very dangerous.  Again, an injury to a person, an immobilizing injury to anybody that is that size is absolutely a death sentence.  Luckily, that did not happen.  That's just my advice.  And I'm trying to, like I said, I'm trying to use these episodes as a way to point out things that obese people should look for if they're trying to get healthy.  And you should absolutely try to get healthy today.  And if you don't believe so, watch this show.  Watch My 600-lb Life over and over and over and over and over again.  Do not ignore what is in front of you.  Do not ignore the evidence that being obese and allowing yourself to gain more weight while being obese is killing you.  It's absolutely killing you.  It is imprisoning you in a self-made prison of fat, and it's killing you.  And that's just my two cents, no matter.  My name's Alan Roberts.  Hit me up on Instagram at Everyday Fitness.

I hope the King family, absolutely nothing but the best.  Goddamn. ",
