And it's taken a while for some people to realize that, but it's nakedly political.  Same with Google.  I give an example in the tech chapter, as you know, about Google Images.  And it's just fascinating because most people don't, it doesn't occur to most people that when you type something into the search engine, what you're getting back isn't true or not real or not really representative of what you wanted to get.  And one of the examples I give is Google Images, which is just fascinating.  If you go to Google Images and you say, I would like to see, type in, anyone can do it now.  I mean, or they might.  Now I've pointed it out.  They may skew the algorithm back.  But say you want to see photos of gay couples.  Just put gay couples into Google Image Search.  You'll get lots of nice photos of nice, happy gay couples.  A lot of mixed race couples, just to accentuate the positive.  But there's lots of nice gay couples.  Happy, happy gay life.  Do straight couples.  You don't get what you asked for.  You don't get what you asked for.  You get a lot of gays.  Awful lot of gays. ",

Here's another really dangerous one.  Do black couples... You get black couples.  You get happy black couples.  And just picture after picture.  Do white couples.  You get black couples.

Now, it's fascinating, but the most interesting thing is that most people don't know it's going on.  as I say, I mean, it's not like, you know, there are always all these stats on the number of, uh, school age children that think that, that when you Google a question, that things come up in order of truth, you know, there are all these studies of that.  And then, you know, you have to, one of the things of course, with, with, uh, uh, people growing up, children growing up in the internet age is just to make sure they're educated to not think that sort of thing.
