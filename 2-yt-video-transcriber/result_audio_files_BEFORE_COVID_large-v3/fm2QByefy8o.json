            "text": "Well, the investigations are over, the time has come, and you, my little friend, are off to prison.  Come on, there's gotta be something we can do here.  I'm Hillary Clinton.  Hmm, let me think about it.  Um, nope!  I gotta be honest with you, this is like the happiest day of my life.  Look, I'm sorry, okay?  You're sorry, huh?  Well, you can stuff your sorries in a sack there, little lady.  You're headed to the big house.  But I'm really, really sorry!  And I'm really, really happy.  So you're going to the big house, huh, Hillary?  Yeah, they finally got me.  Jeez, took them long enough.  What'd they get you for?  Oh, let me see.  There was Benghazi, deleted emails.  Oh, it's a pretty big file.  How many years did you get?  Hey, Hillary, you gotta pay for your own toilet paper.  How many years you get, white girl?  Yeah, how many years you get, white girl?  Is this the army?  I should be out of here by tonight.  I thought the army was supposed to wear green.  Oh my gosh, this is like totally starting to freak me out a little bit.  Calm down, Hillary.  Grow some balls.  Yeah, girl.  Grow some balls.  You should read the Quran.  It'll help you sleep.  I'm just really freaking out.  This is a lot to take in.  Please, settle down.  You're such a crybaby.  I'll make some prune oil for you later.  It'll help you sleep.  Okay.  At least you ain't got to pay for your own toilet paper up in here.  I got to pay for my own toilet paper, and I'm going to do it.  Don't worry, girl.  I can't kill you.  You can be my bitch.  Hey, Clinton, you got a visitor.  Oh, I hope it's Bill.  He's gonna get me out of here.  I just know it.  Oh, my gosh.  I am so excited to see you, Bill.  Are you ready for your conjugal visit?  Um, Hillary, uh, I got some bad news.  What are you talking about?  You're supposed to get me out of here.  Yeah, that's gonna be a problem.  What are you talking about?  You're supposed to get me out of here.  Well, it's a funny story.  Um, since you've been in here, me and Monica, well, we got back together and, uh, Well, we're getting married.  You're marrying Monica?  Oh my gosh!  Yeah, I've never been happier.  Um, I'll send you an invite.  Well, you know what?  Maybe I won't send you an invite.  You're such a jerk.  What am I gonna do now?  Well, my guess is 25 to life.  Hey there, Chunky.  You wanna get some smokes in here for me and my bitches?  Nancy, you know I can't do that.  Maybe I'll make it with you a while and change your mind, huh?  I don't think that's gonna happen.  I don't know.  Maybe you're coming for the showers?  Seemingly, everything just might have a change of thought.  Get back to your cell.  What you in here for, girl?  Same thing as you, girl.  I figured.  It's all Trump's fault.  Damn straight, it's Trump.  And all them damn white people, too.  Girl, you got to pay for your own toilet paper.  Hell yeah, I got to pay for my own toilet paper.  My white toilet paper.  Yeah, Trump's getting all of us.  We're dropping like flies over here.  Well, if he keeps it up, all Democrats will be in prison by the end of the year.  Well, if all the Democrats go to prison, that means... Yep, America will actually be great.  We can't have that.  We gotta get out of here.  Michelle, I think you're in the wrong prison.  Man, what you doing up in here?  I thought you was one of us.  I'm working undercover.  I'm trying to break everybody out.  Yeah, whatever.  You probably break out all the white people first.  Just relax.  Do you need any toilet paper?  If it's free, I ain't paying for no toilet paper.  So, am I getting out of here or what?  It doesn't look like any of us are getting out.  Yeah, Hillary, I think you just need to get nice and comfortable here.  You ain't going nowhere.  I think this will be good for us, you know?  Relax, drink a little bit of Prudhoe, and just live our lives, you know?  I don't believe it.  I'm getting out of here.  Clinton, back to your cell.  It's lock-up time.  No! ",
