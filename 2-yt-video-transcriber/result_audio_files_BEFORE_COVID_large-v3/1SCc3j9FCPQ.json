            "text": "In May 2019, shark investigators attended the Rowell Ranch Rodeo, which is located in Castro Valley in Alameda County, California.  This rodeo is sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, or the PRCA.  In this first of a series of videos exposing the cruelty of the 2019 Rowell Rodeo, we'll look at the treatment of horses.  It should be mentioned that the Rowell Rodeo Committee tried to ban video cameras.  But our investigators filmed this cruelty secretly, and we also used a drone.  As in past years, tame, domesticated horses were harassed and tormented into acting wild for the entertainment of people with no apparent ethical or moral code.  Some horses were slapped in the face.  Some were hit in the face or mouth.  Some had their heads pulled around.  Some horses reacted in desperation.  Some horses collapsed in the chutes.  One horse ran right into a gate.  They struggled and they faltered.  Anyone who understands? ",
