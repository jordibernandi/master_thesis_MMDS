When I vote for a Republican, I want two things, a prick and a square.  A father figure, if you will, to stop mommy, the Democrat, from spending all the money.  if i want to get less what's wrong with social justice was not interested in justice.  the richardson clicks the richardson getting clicks.  hopefully what you don't think so well i think that you're.

            "text": "The point is, if you add up all the free things that the under 40 crowd is used to getting from the quick jerk at work to being able to sit in Starbucks all day for the price of a scone, from music to Wi-Fi to birth control.  It's not such a jarring proposition when socialism comes along and says you are entitled to free stuff.  And that, in turn, must be why there's this proliferation of websites like Kickstarter and GoFundMe.  GoFundMe.  Go fun yourself.  That's what gets the headlines, and that's what dominates media.  See, it's the kid who's screaming at the professor who then gets a job.  at the Huffington Post.  That's right.  And provides fodder for right-wing media to say, look how terrible he is.  And the problem with liberals in general is that they let those kids who are at the Huffington Post or whatever writing their insane, woke shit.  They let them control the debate, just like the parents let the kid control when we're leaving.  We've let the kids take over.  That's like job one you don't do in civilizations.  No, that's right.  You respect the elders.  That's like every civilization before this one.  Let me ask this.  I've asked this question before.  If a European country sometime in the future became 51% Muslim, Would it be the same country?  Would it have the same values, the same laws?  You asked that question about Catholics.  I will ask that question, and the answer is it wouldn't change, because they're already the f***ing majority.  But if you say the word socialism to people under 40, their reaction is night and day from that of baby boomers, for whom socialism has always been seen as communism's gay cousin.  I'm not suggesting that we throw the transgendered under the bus or discount their struggle.  It can't be easy finding pantyhose when you're 6'4\".  People who take disability, who are on disability.  In 1968, it was 51 to 1, people on disability to people who worked.  In 2001, not that long ago, it was 23 to 1.  Now it's 13 to 1.  13 people to one who are on disability.  Now, of course, you know, some of that is real.  We are an overworked, overstressed, polluted, ripped off and lied to people.  So, I mean, obviously there are some people who really do have disability.  But 13 to one, you know, it just seems like there's less people pulling the wagon and more people in the wagon.  And at one point, some point, the wagon is going to break.  Almost two-thirds of Sanders voters want free college and free universal health coverage for no more than an extra thousand dollars in taxes, even though that's not really socialism.  That's Santa-ism.  Or, at worst, an Islamophobe.  Islamophobe, yes.  Yes.  A silly word that means nothing.  Yes.  I mean, it's so dumb because, you know, all the people who are accused of being Islamophobes, like you and me and Sam and Ian, We're liberals.  We're liberals about everything.  I mean, from the time I was a child in my home, I was seven years old when my parents told me, we're for Kennedy and him trying to let black people go to college in the South.  I didn't even know who black people were.  There weren't any in my town.  I knew we were on their side.  And then we were on the side of Cesar Chavez and the lettuce pickers.  And then we were on the side... And we were on the side of the women's movement and poor and the minorities, whatever it was, gay people, the disabled, the abused, the molested, whatever Caitlyn is up to.  We were for it.  I still don't know those things.  I know what a few people said.  You know, there's, you know, as Al, I think, has said.  Just that picture alone was enough for me to, like, reconsider my vote.  The picture was just a joke.  Really?  You can't get by the picture?  You know, the one where he's doing that?  You know what?  I can't get by it.  Really?  I can't.  That's somebody who should lose his Senate job for taking that?  Especially lose his Senate job for that.  We should hold those people to higher account.  But he was a comedian at the time.  It's just, it's a threat of insane headline.  College president forced to apologize after saying all lives matter.  You know what happened?  A college president sent out an email in support of the protesters in Ferguson, but said all lives matter instead of black lives matter.  and then had to apologize?  I'm sorry, I meant black lives, all lives.  Back me up on this, guys.  Sort of lost the white working man.  That's what they used to have.  And they made the white working man feel like your problems aren't real because you're mansplaining.  And, you know, check your privilege.  But you know what?  If your life sucks, your problems are real.  And you know what?  What should I do?  Cut my dick off and check my privilege?  Saw at Middlebury.  Show the tape.  And this could be any college, by the way, when a speaker is invited.  And this is what happens.  Oh, Manos, thou of primal darkness, thou who dwelleth in the depth of the universe in the black chasms of night.  Yeah, that's the free speech of the left.  People are privileged.  Why does everything have to be that?  Really?  I'm a white man.  I can't talk about global warming because I'm privileged?  What should I do?  Just send an apology to Kendrick Lamar tomorrow and then I can talk about global warming?  I'd rather talk about something a little bit more deeper than that.  the reasons and the problem and the solutions behind it get exposed is because they were afraid to speak out because that's the only.  it's the because it's the only religion that acts like the mafia that will kill you if you say the wrong thing draw the wrong picture or write the wrong book.  what is your solution?  what is your answer?  the solution?  we've killed more muslims and they've killed us by an awful.  yet somehow we're exempted from these things because they're not really a reflection of what we believe in.  We did it by accident.  That's why we invaded Iraq.  We're not convincing anybody.  I'm not specifically telling you that I disagree with what you think.  I'm treating them like a minority.  I mean, if Filipinos were capturing teenagers and sending them into white slavery, we would criticize that.  We wouldn't say, well, they're Filipinos.  You'd criticize the people who are doing it, not the Philippines.  Look, I am pro-choice, but I mean, I'm a little squishy and always have been because they told my mother after my sister, very difficult birth, she shouldn't have another one.  So knowing that I could have been on the cutting room floor, I'm... What?  Why is that so terrible?  But I get it.  As long as it's still in you... Your mom made her choice.  Yes.  And we're all here with the consequences of that choice.  I just want to say, Mrs.  Marr... First of all, fuck you.  You can go watch another show.  We got a lot on the lot here if I'm not doing it for you.  I just want to say... I'm asking the hard questions.  God bless her for having you.  I'm sure it wasn't easy.  I'm a mom with three kids.  It ain't easy.  But the point is, she and your father, and she made her choice.  Again, I'm not arguing what you're pretending.  I'm arguing for, all of you on this panel.  You assholes.  I don't even think Clint said anything, so I don't think he should be blamed for this.  He's not.  I'm talking to you, too.  I'm a house... Thank you. ",
