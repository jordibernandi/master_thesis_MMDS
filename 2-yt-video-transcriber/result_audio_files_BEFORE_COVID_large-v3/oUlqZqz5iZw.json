It was his ward in which Chicago Fire was filming on December 13th, Friday, and December 14th, Saturday.  It says, Dear Residents and Businesses, open for business productions, LLC.  LLC stands for Limited Liability Corporation.  It is one step above a sole proprietorship.  A sole proprietorship is when you are the only person involved in your business.  So that is one step up a limited liability corporation.  We will be filming scenes for the show Chicago Fire in Your Neighborhood on December 13th and December 14th.  In order to park essential vehicles and equipment streets in the area will be posted as a no parking tow zone during these dates and times.  So everybody in the ward that was names that was on the email list got this email.  This is the bottom of the email.  If you have any questions, concerns, special needs, please contact location manager William Higgins or Antonio O. Permits and traffic control, if required, are being coordinated by the city... Chicago Film Office, and the Chicago Police Department.  We will not block driveways, loading zones, fire hydrants, bus stops, or disabled parking zones.  If you have additional questions regarding any of the filming, call... ",
