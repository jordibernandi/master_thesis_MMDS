You have to actually demonstrate that there is such a law and that there is a God and that this God is the one that is serving to guarantee that the law can't be broken.  What you're essentially saying is it's impossible for man to do X. And because man cannot do X, that means that there's a God and that God is guaranteeing that man can't do X.

But I think for this episode, particularly how we're short on time and have at least one other call that we're going to get to, I'm going to ask, hey... Please call back when I'm on the show.  If I do that to Eric, he might murder me.  So please call back when I'm on the show or reach out online, on Reddit, or on one of the Facebooks to be, and hopefully we'll be able to continue that.
