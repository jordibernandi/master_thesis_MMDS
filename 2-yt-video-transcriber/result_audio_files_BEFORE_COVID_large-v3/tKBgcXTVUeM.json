            "text": "And then one day I was praying and the Lord, I got like 15 words.  You need to write this book on angels.  I'm like, God, if I'm going to write the book on angels, then give me inspiration.  And an angel appeared in my room, handed me a pen.  And when I grabbed the pen, he said, go to Copa Vida.  I went there and I wrote the book in about two weeks.  The download of the next seven chapters came and God supernaturally gave it to me.  And some of you that just heard that right now, you're like, wait, did you just say an angel gave you a pen?  Then you wrote a book.  Yes.  And he wants to do it with you too.  Come on, let me know that this gospel we're preaching is not natural, but it's supernatural, right?  And so what's amazing is that I was praying, and I had an open vision.  The Lord took me into this vision, and I saw.  It was like Paul says, when I was in the body of alibis somewhere with God, I got taken into this council room, and there was Jesus with a map of the whole world.  And he took out this, like, stick... his staff and he started striking places on the west coast and fires would begin to spark up and he struck them all over and there were so many places that he struck.  and then they started to spread all across the u.s and all across the world.  and and the lord said it's time for the west coast rumble to begin to go out.  And so we just decided, you know what, we're going to do this.  And so what we did is instead of meeting five nights a week, we began to meet four nights a week in San Diego and dedicate our Wednesday night to go out and spread the revival, you know, fire of God.  And what's crazy is, you know, I was really close to Bob Jones.  He was a spiritual papa of mine.  And I probably did 13 or 14 conferences within the last three years of his life.  And he would always tell me, he'd say, Jeremy, he'd say, when the three generals go home to be with the Lord.  He'd been telling me this since like 2010.  He said, when the three generals go home to be with the Lord, he said, there's a move of God that's going to begin to spark that will bring the greatest harvest America's ever seen.  He said, those three generals, he said, are Kenneth Hagin.  If you don't know who Kenneth Hagin is, listen, he's like the founder of the Word of Faith movement, prophet of the Lord, really.  If you don't know who Kenneth Hagin is, you live under a rock.  But anyway, the other man of God that he talked about was Dr.  Oral Roberts.  He said Dr.  Oral Roberts was the second general and the third was Billy Graham.  And he said when the three generals go home to be with the Lord, he said all three of their mantles will be dispersed to the church worldwide.  And he said that those three mantles will begin to be released and a grace will come upon the people of God to begin to move in all three anointings.  And so I want to just kind of continue on what Billy Graham, you know, how many know that Lou talked about Billy Graham?  Listen, I believe it's even bigger.  I believe it's a merging of the generations, but I also believe it's a changing of the guards.  And that what God had done in past times with forerunners, with men and women of faith that really carried something powerful, you know, God is releasing that kind of a realm again on another generation.  And he's looking for people that are hungry.  But here's the deal.  How many know there's going to be thousands of those that are walking in Dr.  Oral Roberts' mantle?  I don't know if you guys know, but Dr.  Oral Roberts moved in healing, miracles, faith.  I mean, we're talking they'd line up three miles of people, lay hands on them all.  And almost 98% of them would be healed when he had a fire that would come in his right hand.  And he would start to lay hands on them.  And you know what's crazy is.  the Lord told us which day to launch the West Coast Rumble movement today.  And the day we launched it, he had died five hours before.  And so, you know, what's interesting about it is that I thought it was no coincidence.  We've been hosting revival for two years.  Now the Lord says, take it out and begin to release it everywhere that you go.  And when we actually set the date, the first day is when he went home to be with the Lord.  What's crazy about it is every venue we've gone to since has been standing room only.  The miracles that have been breaking out.  We're talking like metal dissolving out of bodies.  We're talking people that, you know, have tumors and paralyzed bodies.  I mean, we went to Arizona and we went over there and preached and the power of God hit that place.  People that had strokes, that came in the meeting with walkers and canes and could not walk, could not move.  They were throwing their canes across the front of the building.  I mean, listen, I got one report from a man that's here today.  I don't even know if he's in here, named Phil.  We were in Rancho Cucamonga.  Phil, if you're in here, just stand.  I don't need to bring you up here.  But anyway, he was in one of the meetings, and he's over there.  And he had three blood clots.  And he called it out by word of knowledge and began to pray.  And he already went back to the doctors.  They can't find the blood clots anymore, you guys.  Amen.  And we're talking like cancer's been healed.  We're talking blindness.  We're talking crazy miracles that is breaking out because we really believe it's time to strike the ground for revival.  And so listen, I'm telling you, we're not going to waste any more time. ",

That that breaker angel and the company of breaker angels get released to you in Jesus' name.  Whoa!  It also means to use violence and to burst open, to spread and to distribute.  Does that sound like the gospel?  Spreading the good news, distributing, whoa, the good news of his power.  So I'm still in this visitation.
