            "text": "This is going to be a good one.  Now, all of a sudden, people are against race changes, right?  What about?  it was a fictional character?  They were just doing this last week.  Then I see this.  And just to set the scene for you guys, Scarlett Johansson apparently said something along the lines of, um, She should be able to play whoever the hell she wants to.  Now, I believe she sort of backtracked a little bit on that, but there was no shortage of leftists going fucking insane at this.  So this Nancy Wang person, who is a sociologist, she says, And then she's like, oh, but she feels entitled to take roles away from Asian trans and other underrepresented actors.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Stop.  I thought you guys said that this was just a fictional character.  Who cares?  Right?  Who cares about all these race changes?  It's just a fictional character.  It's just a fictional character.  Oh, oh, oh, wait a minute.  Now you're against race changes.  Is that right?  Is that right?  I'm seeing this being retweeted and all these people.  these people are just so inconsistent and remember in my last video where I talked about the insult of race change I spoke on how you're wasting your time trying to argue with some of these types because they do exactly that in which they'll consistently move the goalposts.  right?  I've said that yes race changing classic characters doesn't matter is stupid it's needless it's not necessary it's it's dumb right.  so in a sense i would agree with the overall.  well for different reasons right she?  she's talking about underrepresented roles and all this dumb shit.  i don't give a shit about any of that.  i just think that the character should be kept closely to who they were.  so if they had been classically depicted as such classically depict them as such or continue even in the future live action tv adaptations whatever depict them as such.  And then I make these videos.  These motherfuckers be mad at me.  Oh, racist.  It's not about the... Wait a minute.  It's just a fictional character.  What's the big deal?  Now, all of a sudden, because ScarJo, because she's white more than likely.  Oh, there's a problem.  You can't do that.  You can't do that.  Oh, okay.  So it's not about it's a fictional character anymore.  Did I say that?  If you go watch my videos, you'll hear it.  I said that it was never about, it was a fictional character.  They just going to keep moving the goalposts.  It'll go from his fictional character to where race is close to this character, even though it's not.  And certainly in the sense of anime characters that she's depicted in the movie, race wasn't really tied to that character either.  Wasn't important to that character.  Now, all of a sudden, wait a minute, you can't do that.  That role should be filled by an Asian person, which again, I'd agree.  But I'm consistent in this matter.  I don't justify other race changes.  Now, when it comes to these other aspects and Disney movies and shit that aren't comic book related, I don't really speak on that because I don't really care, right?  That's not my thing.  I'm more about the comics.  So to see people all up in arms about something she said, which again, I believe she sort of backtracked, It's quite comical because it's this playing out.  Something that I've said, it's playing out because I've constantly, constantly, constantly, constantly said this, that they will consistently move this goalpost just to try to come out on top.  It's not about being consistent on any matter.  They just get upset when it's something that doesn't work out in the form that they, you know, the way they want it to, right?  And in this case, because it's white to another one, like I've said time and time again, more so if there's a classically non-white character that gets changed to a white character, they get upset.  But when it's a classically white character getting changed to a non-white character... Then it's a fictional character.  Race is close to this.  It's not the same because race isn't close to this character or something like that, right?  So they keep moving that damn goalpost.  It's not about being consistent.  This is what I'm saying.  You waste your time arguing with these fucking normies that are appeased by this dumb shit because they're not going to be consistent.  It's fucking funny, isn't it?  Now they're against.  race changes.  Now there's a problem.  Now they're taking roles away, right?  Never mind all these damn redheads that keep getting changed.  Jimmy Olsen, Iris West, Wally West.  Never mind all of that.  Talk about the roles that have been taken away from them.  Who cares about that?  Because race isn't close to the character.  It doesn't matter.  It's not of importance to the characters.  It's all about inconsistency all the time.  But I just wanted to show that because I just thought it was hilarious.  I do these videos.  You can read some of my comments in the videos.  People, oh, well, it's just a fictional character.  Why would you even be mad and upset about this?  Didn't they get upset at a race change?  Go figure. ",
