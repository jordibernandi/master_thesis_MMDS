            "text": "Well, anyway, later on today, maybe sometime, I just don't comprehend this.  I cannot comprehend it for the life of me, but I need to address it.  Did y'all see that dog and pony show in circus yesterday?  Envy not thou oppressor.  And can you believe that the brother of Botham, I believe that's his name, wanted to hug the woman who murdered Botham.  her brother.  Now, that's one thing.  Another thing is this is just literally off the chat.  I've never seen it before in all my life.  I've never seen it before.  An actual sitting judge got up off the bench and went and hugged and spoke and counseled with Amber Geiger.  This is off the chain.  This is damn off the proverbial chain.  Now, let me see.  When Daylon Ruth and all these other people out here commit murder and all this other stuff, man, the system protects them 100% carte blanche.  They do.  But all of a sudden, now we got all this remorse.  And let me see.  I hope you find Jesus Christ.  What the... You see, this is the reason why Pastor Dow looks like a villain.  No, we're going to go ahead and do it now.  This is the reason why I look like a villain.  See, I look like a villain because I know what the Bible says.  I know what the scriptures say.  And when I start speaking the scripture, I start watching all the people... who are full of demonic spirits begin to manifest.  I watch this manifestation.  I watch it go on and on and on.  And I sit up there and I shake my head.  I go, these people now understand clearly why the Messiah clearly said, Father, forgive them because they know not what they do.  No, talking about just them in general.  Not talking about what they've done in general.  I'm talking about them.  We have lost our ever-loving mind.  But that's what happens when you're in a society misguided by deception.  It really truly is.  So Amber Geiger gets sentenced 10 years in prisons.  That ain't nothing because good time and behavior, parole, probation, she'll be out.  She'll be out in three.  You kill someone in my family, you're a police officer.  I remember my uncles when I was a little boy, a little boy.  And I remember vaguely, just vaguely, because I was a little bitty boy.  And I remember vaguely that a cop had stopped on the street down, we call it the hood, it was East Nashville.  And he had pushed One of my teenage cousins, I think he was 17, 18 or something like that.  Man, I watched my family members come up off that damn porch, come out of that yard, guns drawn and every damn thing else.  That cop was scared as crap.  And they told him straight up, look, we don't mind you doing your job, but you're not going to sit there and put your hand all over.  Total different generation than today.  Total different generation than today.  But, Now I don't get into the dog and pony show in circus about painting a broad brush about white man or white woman killing black people when I already know exactly what's going on.  Everything's political in this society.  Chicago, you know, every other year when I was a teenager growing up, we would have two places for family reunion and a one place we would just visit because that's what family was.  My family is from Nashville, Tennessee, Detroit, Michigan, and Chicago, Illinois.  That's pretty much the jest of my, of my family.  I do have some scattered in Florida, but, but that's the majority of them right there in that areas.  All right.  And so we will go to Detroit every other year for a family reunion.  Um, And then we will go to Chicago in between every other year or whatever it was.  And then, of course, Nashville as well.  And I tell you what, I remember way back then, family used to be a whole lot more closer than what it is now.  And those old ways and old paths are gone.  But I tell you, I just don't comprehend today because in Chicago, you know, the people with melanated skin, They're killing and murdering each other.  Of course, I know why, too.  You put a certain people and demographics in a certain population area and center, and you bind them all up together, and then you bring drugs in there and have them to sell them to each other, and then they begin to murder, loot, and kill each other, and then we start glorifying death, especially of our own people.  And then we turn around and we actually have a more harsher attitude towards our own rather than the other nations.  Believe me, I get it.  I get it.  But... For... I've never seen anything like this before in my life.  It's hard for me to even articulate it.  I've never seen anything like this before in my life.  How does a judge, and mind you, I think it was a black woman, or a colored woman, or a melanated woman.  How do you get up off the bench and then go hug?  Aren't you supposed to be not by, emotions ain't gonna do with this, right?  How do you hug This woman, and I don't know.  I don't get it.  Why are we supposed to forgive, Pastor Doc?  Believe me.  I believe you mean.  I know what forgiveness is probably more than any preacher out there you've ever learned or ever known or ever heard of in your life.  Believe me, I get it.  I also know that vengeance is mine, and y'all say he's going to repay me.  I also know that y'all is a man of war.  I also know that he's angry with the wicked every day.  I also know that there's a judgment for murder.  I also know that there's a judgment when you steal a man.  That's what the law says.  You steal a man from his land and then you sell him to someone else.  as a slave.  Also, believe me, the scriptures cover all that stuff, but that's ignored in your arenas of religion.  They're not gonna talk about stuff like that.  But I'd be damned if I sit up there and I saw this guy hugged a woman that killed her brother.  You ain't getting no damn hugs from me.  You ain't getting nothing from me.  You see, closure is when you get shot and killed in the exact same way that you kill a man in cold blood.  That's truth.  That's truth.  That's justice.  not lock them away for allegedly 10 years and give them three squares and a cot.  And I believe me, I know that this is just entirely too strong for many people, but the reason why it's too strong, because let's just go on in a minute.  Many of you don't know this Bible.  You don't know this scripture and you don't know the creator universe because in the grand scheme of things in your life, You don't have time to read what it really has to say.  You would rather accept what religion tells you or what some effeminate preacher gets up and tries to communicate with you and articulate to you what it's actually saying.  But I am never in my life... I sat up and just shook my head and stood and said, oh, did this judge just get up and hug this woman who just got sentenced to prison for murder?  And did the brother... of the man that got murdered by this woman using the uniform badge and a gun to do it.  Did he just get up and hug her too?  No.  I tell you, I tell you, this satanic religion of Christianity has got people literally turned upside down.  I'm serious.  People don't know where they're coming or going.  It's off the chain.  It's off the proverbial chain.  It makes no sense to me.  It probably never will make any sense to me.  And I think that that's my trouble in this world that we live in today.  And I realized well over 27 years ago, that's the reason why that they call me a crackpot, a kook, and a fanatic.  Believe me, I get it.  They call me all those things because I chose to actually do something.  what the scriptures say.  And I'm still doing it today.  So men's opinions are totally vain.  Believe me.  I actually live the book.  I do what the book says.  And I have received nothing but opposition.  I even got a troll on me now.  This man by the name of Brian Howard, he referred to himself as coward.  He, for some reason, this Caucasian man, he comes over and he admits that the Israelites are melanated people, always have been.  He's in the ministry, and I pick up the phone.  I call him one day.  I'm digressing here for a second, all right?  And I ask him, hey, because we had him on our platform, didn't hear from him for a while.  I ask him, how you doing?  Oh, we doing well.  We know I've just got a few things going on.  A few weeks later, next thing you know, he's blasting me from here to kingdom coming.  I'm trying to figure out, can anybody tell me what I did to this man?  Nothing.  Oh, now all of a sudden I'm a liar and everything.  Well, we can adjudicate those matters by using an arbitrator in Bishop's Court, Ecclesiastical Court, whatever it is.  Now back on script again, had to throw that bone out there.  But I tell you, man, I'm lost.  I'm lost for words.  What is happening in this world that we live in?  You know what?  I'm gonna stay out here in this country.  I'm gonna help the brothers get ready for deer season.  Because we love venison here at Straightway.  I mean, at least out here, there's sanity. ",
