By the way, though, you said they weren't great at advertising.  Check this out.  We take it.  your hashtag math isn't correct.  Might want to crunch those numbers in Microsoft Excel.  Verified Microsoft Excel Twitter account, by the way.  111,000 followers.  Okay.  After reading this, and then they link to a link we're going to go do in a second here.  First of all, I just wanted to... I get it.  They're marketers.  They have to do their job.  This is, in my opinion, absolutely pathetic.  I love it.  First of all, I'll show you why.  Spike in the football on anything, Bing, get out of here.  And we'll show you exactly why.  Get out of here.  Oh, you better do your math, Andrew Yang.  I think that was the thing.  If their response was more on the lines of like, hey, we hear you guys, but we've made a lot of changes.  We hope you check Bing out.  Actually, we've been doing well on this metric.  I wouldn't even be talking about this right now.  But it's not that they come at him like, oh, better get your numbers right, Yang.  What do you know about Bing and Excel?  So here we go, though.  Again, so I look at the link they send, and it says, first of all.  Bing's not the laughing stock of technology anymore.  Is that your spike the football celebration link?  We're no longer the laughing stock of technology.  Congratulations, man.  I feel great for you.  I feel great for you.  Here's what's funny, though.  So the lead here is they say it still pales in comparison to Google, but it generates nearly three times the advertising revenue of Twitter, which if anyone's familiar with Twitter, one of the big issues Twitter has that doesn't generate any advertising revenue.  It's like one of the issues with the company is they don't know how to make money with Twitter.  um so they make more money than twitter the company that can't make any money.  uh this is what i thought was hilarious.  so they uh where's the graph?  here we go.  so This is kind of the headline of the article, that Microsoft, in its pathetic response to Andrew Yang trying to get people to use Bing, and it says, not bad.

So, I figured why not take some time today to just clown on Bing, like yanked it on stage.  Because this response, this marketing response from Bing, seriously, from Microsoft, is just... Embarrassing, man.  We take it your math isn't correct.  No one uses Bing.  You don't even, the math, just walk into the street, ask someone whatever, just Bing.  Most people who use Bing probably don't know.  they use Bing because they don't know anything about computers and they open up Microsoft Edge, what they call it now, because no one used Internet Explorer and your default search is Bing.

I think they might have lost that contract recently, but Microsoft had a deal where certain types of searches would be handled by Bing and not handled by Google.  And so this is when.  this is when I actually don't know if I agree with Andrew Yang.  I don't think necessarily breaking them up is going to work because when it comes to tech companies and in the modern day, all of the government-induced breakups of large conglomerates have only made strangely stronger companies afterwards.  It's not like in the 1920s when you could go in there and do the antitrust thing.  Making an even playing field so that the smaller search engines can compete is really what needs to get done.

We've had our own frustrating experiences with Google with copyright strikes and copyright claims on things that really are completely under fair use.  We've had lawyers look at and, and what are you going to do?  Levy a lawsuit against the $50 billion company and, where there's not even a phone number you can call at $400 an hour for a copyright lawyer over a podcast.  that may get you a hundred bucks in revenue.  And they know this.  and there's all of this abuse that goes on by people who are copyright striking you in order to try and leverage you or else Google not carrying in preference for legacy media, trying to prop up legacy media because of truly ideological reasons.  I mean, you see what Steven Crowder went through.  You see Dave Backman got toasted yesterday.  What this channel's gone through.  You have to find a way so that smaller channels can compete.  By the way, I don't want smaller channels to be given a bigger advantage.  I mean, there's part... You know, it builds character being a small channel and having to grow and everything like that.  I don't want any freebies, but an even playing field is really what I think is going to make it so that these tech companies achieve the equilibrium that they do not have right now.  And I don't know enough about tech to know what is lacking.  Generally, the libertarian and the conservative businessman in me believes that it's probably regulation of some sort because of my entire life.  I've always seen that be the case, but I'm open for other possibilities.  And I love the fact that Bing is fighting back.  Let me tell you.  I think it's funny, and I almost want to use Bing for a week just to try it out, you know? ",

It's fun, but I want to keep the political angle up still.  Andrew Yang says breaking up big tech won't solve fundamental problems of social media.  And I believe one of the reasons why... Andrew Yang also, he mentions here, he says, yeah, it's a 20th century solution to a 21st century problem.  Yeah.  It's not as simple as just breaking them up.  Just break them up.  Oh, yeah.  Twitter is separate technically from Facebook and Google and \u2013 well, Facebook isn't too separate from other things.  You know what I mean?  And they're still kind of viewed as big tech.

And he actually mentions what he actually talks about.  So... One of the fundamental problems that our social media apps are causing higher levels of depression, anxiety among teenagers, and breaking up the apps into separate companies does nothing to change that.  And this article is from June, but I believe this is still the line Andrew Yang maintains, where he basically says... The biggest problems we see with big tech, like I said, it isn't that, oh, my God, there's this website called YouTube and you can upload videos to it.  This is awful.  It's what are these companies doing subconsciously to us.  and how are we, you know, what is our reaction in our relationship with these platforms?  And I think that's what Yang tries to get people to talk about.  more is like, look, it's more our relationship with these platforms are unhealthy than the fact that Instagram exists is bad.  Yeah.  Instagram existing is neutral.  Our relationship to it, that might be what's negative.  And making it so Zuckerberg doesn't own Instagram anymore won't make our relationship, our societal relationship with Instagram any healthier, which I think is Andrew Yang's point.  And I think one of the reasons why is, look, Bing, no one uses you.  Breaking up Google, guess what?  If Google Web Search was its own company, it would still beat Bing.  It doesn't matter that Google's this massive monolithic company.  If it was just Google Web Search, it'd be more popular than, by the way, if we were going to break up big tech, then it would be called Microsoft Web Search, not Bing, because it's owned by Microsoft.  So the line being that I think is his joke, which, by the way, it did go over pretty well.  I think I have, do I have it here?  Someone else tweeted out about it.  There's a lot of people tweeting about it.  There's another political commentator who tweeted out and said, here we go, Sagar and Jetty.  Oh, I believe I pronounced them incorrectly.  I apologize.

I might actually prefer a more rudimentary and bare bones, just keyword driven search.  like Bing provides, but it does go to show and illustrate that the Google search algorithm is much more refined and much more intuitive for the 90% of those cases where you're just trying to get to the general thing that's within the bell curve that most people know and you've simply forgotten.

This was a great article.  It's from 2017 from marketplace.org.  How in the world is Twitter still not making any money, right?

Get out of here with this crap, Microsoft.  No one's going to use Bing.  No one cares about Bing.  No one used Bing before.
