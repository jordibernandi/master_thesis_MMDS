            "text": "Hi there!  So I wanted to make a short video regarding my Girl Talk series.  I recently completed episode 10 and I think that as much as this has been a really valuable experience for my audience, particularly my female audience, this This series has taught me a lot of things.  Some things more important than others, but I think that the more women that I speak to, the more well-rounded my understanding of what it means to be a right-wing or a traditional woman is.  And one of the things that I think is most important that I really want to touch on it and really just sort of reiterate in a video on its own that hopefully will be kind of short, um, is regarding motherhood.  And I think on the left, we see a lot of women sort of degrading motherhood, putting motherhood down, um, sort of saying really derogatory things that, you know, gestational work and it's a kind of slavery and it's, you know, awful.  They have very few good things to say about motherhood.  And I think that that's really wrong and really harmful to women.  But there's something that we do on the right that is equally as harmful.  Maybe not equally, but it is also harmful to women.  And that is that we tend to oversimplify how great motherhood is.  We tend to promote motherhood as something that will make you happy, give you purpose.  It's the most important thing that you can do.  And it's not that I don't necessarily believe those things.  It's just that I know.  for some women it isn't like that.  I have received a number of emails from women who have expressed such gratitude to me for making my videos with mothers and my latest one with Ed Dutton about how happiness is predicted more so by personality most of the time than it is by whether or not you have children.  For example, one of the things that we spoke about in that last video with Ed Dutton called, does having children really make you happy, is that things like extroversion, having high self-esteem, being low in things like neuroticism, these are greater predictors of whether or not you're going to be a happy person than whether or not you're a mother.  So hearing this has been a huge relief to some women who are struggling with motherhood who have postpartum depression, who have had difficulty bonding with their babies at first, women who are struggling with the lack of sleep and the amount of pain that can result from trying to breastfeed and heal from things like cesarean sections and natural childbirths.  There's a tremendous amount of trauma that the body endures in motherhood.  I've had women say, your body's never really the same.  Now, of course, if your weight gain isn't excessive and stuff, you can always kind of bounce back to a certain degree if you're living a healthy lifestyle.  But from what I've heard from many mothers, there are certain things that change about your body which never really quite go back.  to the way they were before pregnancy.  And for some women, this is not a big deal.  It's a really small thing.  But for other women, it's very difficult to accept, I think.  And it can cause a lot of difficulty with settling into this new identity as a mother.  I've had some women say to me that they feel like their body isn't theirs anymore You know because every single time that baby cries they have to get up they have to feed they have to rock them to sleep They have to change the diaper to.  you know you become Fully absorbed in the nurturing and the looking after of this little thing that you love and And so for some women, that is something that they slip into with ease.  And these women who I've spoken to some of these women in on this series, and they are some of the strongest, most intelligent, most kind hearted, just amazing people that I think I've ever met.  And I don't want to detract from the fact that those women exist.  I want to hold these women up because they are the role models for the women who struggle with motherhood.  But I don't think it's fair to sell women this idea that having a baby is going to solve all your problems.  It's not.  That's not really what motherhood or having a child should be about.  If you're having a baby because of peer pressure in the right wing movement or in the social circles that you run in or because you want people to stop telling you that there's a lot of jerks, I feel like, anonymous jerks in comment sections a lot of the time, and they'll say things like, your life is worthless if you're not a mother, or shut up, your opinions are irrelevant because you're not a mother yet.  This is so damaging to the women in our community.  It's so harsh, it's so damaging, and ironically, I think it negatively affects fertility.  If you want women to be fertile and go forth and multiply, giving them this extra anxiety about whether or not they will be able to conceive or being able to conceive on somebody else's timeline causes unnecessary stress and stress is a really harmful thing which negatively affects fertility.  We need to be supporting women in this movement if you want them to be healthy moms.  You also don't know if a woman is trying to conceive and she's having difficulty.  How do you think that that affects a woman when she's trying to conceive, she's actively trying?  And for many healthy people, regardless of their age, it can take up to a year to conceive.  So imagine the stress of trying to conceive, just maybe having a bit of difficulty.  You know, it can be really, really painful to be patient when you're trying to conceive.  from what I've heard.  You know each month is the two-week wait trying to find out whether or not you are you aren't it's.  it's grueling and For some women it's really tough and then to have these other people on the other side of things.  You know nagging in your ear and nagging you making you feel bad that you haven't had a baby yet.  This is so counterproductive.  I really want to.  if you have done this if you're watching this and you have done this, please um take a step back and question as to whether or not these sorts of negs are coming from a place of just you know being a jerk or if you really want Women to be mothers and you really want women to take that burden on because if you do Giving them extra anxiety about the timeline of their fertility and having having a child is making it worse.  I promise you that I speak to him behind the scenes and it's making it worse.  Please stop.  Please stop doing that and you know We need to be real with women about what motherhood about.  It's not about being happy.  you shouldn't be.  you shouldn't be entering into motherhood because you want to make yourself happy.  Entering into motherhood is sacrificial.  It's virtuous But it is in a way somewhat sacrificial.  you and your life becomes about somebody else and it's a beautiful thing.  and And I'll never stop trying to lift women up who take that burden on and do it with grace.  to deny the reality that some women really struggle with motherhood, especially in the beginning.  Some women have really horrific pregnancies.  Every pregnancy is different.  And I've heard this from moms who have like two and three kids.  Each pregnancy that even the same woman has will be really, really different.  So having this oversimplified perspective on the right that you know mother who's gonna complete you and it's gonna give you the sense of purpose and it's gonna make you happy.  it's irresponsible to say that to young women because some women like it or lump it guys they are not meant to be mothers and some women can't be mothers.  so to deny that these women can't have a positive effect on their communities that they can't have purposeful lives that they can't be happy is just wrong.  it's just not true and I think it is a kind of fracturing of the community which is counterproductive and it's cruel and it's unnecessary.  and I just I just want I really hope that it can stop because There is an antinatalist element to this kind of bullying of women, I think, about their fertility and telling them that the only thing that they can do to win the approval of their community is to be mothers.  I just, you know, I think for many of us it is the greatest thing that we will ever do.  And I think for me, I'm hoping that it will be something that brings me a lot of joy.  But I'm not gonna delude myself or deceive women into thinking that it's something that is gonna solve all my problems.  I don't want to be a mother so that I can get the validation of the men or the women in this movement.  I'm doing it for me, I'm doing it for my future husband, I'm doing it for my mother and my father who I want to make grandparents and my grandparents who I want to make great-grandparents And I am under no illusions that it is going to be probably one of the most difficult things that I ever embark on.  so that being said Let's as a community.  If you're a fan of my content and you appreciate the women in this movement and what they're doing and how they're trying to set an example for young women, cut us some slack.  Be pro-natalist in supporting women in a positive way about them moving towards fertility.  Stop bullying women about getting pregnant as fast as possible because you don't know if they're actually trying or not.  And you don't know if that bullying is actually contributing to stress which is negatively affecting their ability to conceive.  And let's stop telling women that you don't get pregnant or you can't have children.  you're going to be miserable and your life is going to be pointless because it's just not true.  All of the science indicates that for the most part people are either happy or they're not and that's a personality characteristic.  It has very little to do with whether or not you have children.  Yeah, so I'm hoping that as I progress with this series, I can get more stories and more well-rounded information from real moms that can expand my own knowledge and my viewers' knowledge of the complexity of motherhood and the reality of motherhood.  If you have any stories, so I've received a lot of stories actually already and they are very powerful and very moving.  And I'm hoping to maybe start doing some story times where I can read the stories of the women who have reached out to me about their stories and about what they've experienced as moms.  And of course I will keep your identity anonymous.  You can email me.  My email will be in the description.  It's criticalcondition at pm.me.  Check for it in the description if you want to send me your story and share your story about motherhood.  and maybe have it featured on my channel in this sort of motherhood story time that I plan to start working on.  If you don't mind about kind of more publicly sharing these stories, feel free to post short stories in the comment section of this video.  So I want to thank you so much for listening to this video.  Thank you for watching and supporting the girl talk series.  It's been really fun.  I'm really excited for where it's headed and I just you know, I can't keep track of all the women who You know are being suggested to me and that I'm running into and meeting online all the time Who I think have a lot to offer this community and each other.  so that being said I hope everyone has a great week and if you enjoyed this video uh like and uh share subscribe.  if you haven't already and if you want to support the channel there will be links in the description for you to do so.  thank you so much bye.
