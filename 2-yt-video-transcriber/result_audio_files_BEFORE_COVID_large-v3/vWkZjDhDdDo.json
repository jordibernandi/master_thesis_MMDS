Basically, looks like it was wildly successful, Andrew Yang's... not giveaway giveaway.  And a lot of people question whether or not it was an FEC violation, but the FEC is closed for business right now in an election year because they can't get a quorum assembled together in order not to declare whether it's a violation or not.  But a bunch of lawyers have said it isn't, while a bunch of pundits and other lawyers have said it is.  So we're just gonna analyze all of this really fast.

Basically, he was going to pilot the Freedom Dividend with 12 families.  And you could just come here and sign up.  They're going to give away $1,000 a month to 12 different individuals for 12 months.  So total about a million dollars.  Sorry, $128,000.  Something like that.  Anyway.  All you have to do to sign up, very easy, was first and last name, email, and zip code.  So what did that mean for the Yang campaign, right?  Well, it means that over 455,000 people have signed up and, more importantly, given their email addresses to the campaign.  They say 90% of those are new email addresses.  Also, he raised $1 million in 72 hours since the debate.  $1 million in 72 hours.  I believe he raised a couple million... He raised $2.8 million in the second quarter alone, so $1 million in three days.  A lot of money.  Like I said, 90% of the 450,000 email addresses he obtained were brand new.  So I was questioning what this was actually going to mean when he ran it out.  To be frank, I didn't love it originally.  But holy cow, we have to say it's a massive success.  At this point, he raised a million dollars, got 400-something thousand email addresses now to add to his email list.  You could probably convert 450,000 email addresses into what?  At least another couple hundred thousand dollars, at least. ",

The silence here.  is actually of great importance because it speaks to the efficacy or absolute non-efficacy of government.  We have this thing called the Federal Election Committee, right?  And these people, the FEC, as it's called for short, are the ones that are in charge of making sure that everybody runs their elections above book.  That all of the polling machines aren't substandards, we don't have hanging chads, that all of the dates are met, that the quarterly reports are met.  I mean, this is a massive bureaucracy.  that's actually pretty good because I've dealt with it a lot in the sense that they care that everything is run fair.  OK, these are the arbiters and these are the people that are the referees of the elections.  Right.  However, they've got appointed officials just like many other bureaucracies do.  And unfortunately, unable to hold a quorum, meaning having enough of their directors present on their board of directors.  OK, actually, I don't know if the body is a board of directors or what it's a board of, but they don't have enough of their chiefs.  okay, around that they can actually opine on what is a violation or not.  And there's some serious questions here.  Is Andrew Yang just giving away money?  I think if he would have actually said, we're participating in a study to prove to the American people as an act of publicity that the freedom dividend works and improve people's lives, I don't think people would have batted an eye at that.  But because during his... debate he said today we're going to give away and he used the word giveaway.  I think it improperly and and and optically misframed the argument as a giveaway instead of a sociological and scientific analysis of whether or not UBI improves people's lives stress levels family lives so on and so forth.  okay so So what we would do, usually in this situation, if I was Zach Grumman, who was in charge of Andrew Yang's campaign, or I were Joe Biden's campaign manager and wanted to cry foul, what would we do?  We would call the FEC and say, hey, you guys are the referees.  In this situation, what happens?  How do we move forward?  When a guy shoots a three-pointer and the ball gets stuck in the rim, which rarely happens, gosh, what's the rule?  You ask the referee, right?  Our government is so incompetent.  During an election year, the FEC can't pull a quorum.  That's the same as if during a wartime year, the Joint Chiefs of Staff didn't have enough guys to be able to actually show up and advise the president.  Because, you know, they're kind of stuck in the muddy waters of bureaucracy and haven't been able to push through their appointees.  So, to me, this is all just a more stronger argument for Andrew Yang's UBI because it proves the inefficiency of bureaucracy.  Let's just take ",

The big takeaway I have from it, though, as a whole, is that part of their current strategy.  I believe they have three of the four they would need and three of six total.  They actually can't offer advice to politicians and political committees and seek it.  So I do kind of wonder a little bit how sure AMGA can be doing everything in the right.  That being said, also, please keep in mind campaign finance violations happen to everyone all the time.  Obama paid $100,000 in fines.  It's part of running for president.  You're going to do things that... Not always great, especially, I believe, because in 08, similar thing.  There was an understaffed FEC in 2008.  So again, there was no quorum.  So I believe that's the biggest glaring issue here is they are not able to go to them and ask them for help.  So I think that's where it actually can start damaging.  But here's the other thing I wanted to bring up just while we're talking about Andrew Yang's raffle donation giveaway.  Yeah.  Not everybody, mainly the media.  For whatever reason, the media hates that he did this.  And I wanted to bring up this article from the Washington Examiner, and it's just kind of interesting to me.  They said, Yang requests donations from Freedom Dividend raffle entrants.  A Democratic presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang made a splash during Thursday's debate by announcing he'd be giving away $1,000 a month for a year to 10 lucky Americans who enter his Freedom Dividend raffle.  But now he's looking to them for donations to his campaign.  The raffle, which boldly boasts no strings attached on the landing page of Yang's campaign website, asks only for entrance name and email addresses.  In a Saturday morning fundraising email, however, Yang asks raffle participants to chip into the cause, which... is a pretty big no-brainer like we said that.  that's why he boasted about how many emails he added to his email list.  he's going to email them and ask them for money.  well and also i thought that was what i just i've heard some people bring that up like oh yeah the donator was trying to get donations from people and it's it's some like jaded cynical thing.  it's like what that is the plane here.  He has the raffle.  He gets your info.  Some people win.  He gets your information to ask you for money.  That's the play.  So I thought the confusion around that was really interesting because, like I said, there seems to be some confusion around two things.  One, is it legal?  It seems like the answer is who cares.  It doesn't matter if it's legal.  And then two... Do you have to donate?  Is he some jaded?  No, I think that's part of it, yes.  He wants your information.  The easiest way to get your information is to offer something in return, entrance, and do a $12,000 grand prize.  That's a pretty good way to do it.  I think that's what we're seeing here, and I think that's one of the reasons why He raised a million dollars, added 400,000 emails to his email list, and has gotten not all good, but he's gotten plenty of publicity for it.  And that's why I think it is.  I think it's because this, in the end of the day, really did end up being a big win for the Yang campaign. ",

I'm not.  the ends justify the means guy.  In fact, I probably pay way too much attention to to the means more than the ends, you know.  But I do have to say.  It seems to have worked, yes.  How about this?  If we analyze the ends, not only did it seem to have worked, it seemed to have been wildly more effective dollar per dollar than having spent the amount of money that he's giving out on the UBI on TV commercials or radio commercials or Facebook ads.  And I'm surprised that they didn't actually just say one in every single state.  There's been chatter for a long time about them wanting to replicate what they did in Iowa and in New Hampshire in all of the states.  But he ended up only choosing 10.  And I do continue to say that... I disagree a little bit with the analysis of the Washington Examiner.  They're very conservative over the Washington Examiner.  And it was actually founded to be a response to what was perceived as the very liberal Washington Post.  And I think they're falling a little bit into the trap of most conservatives where they just say, oh, socialism is one big fat giveaway.  And it behooves the Andrew Yang campaign to continually clarify that the UBI is saving capitalism.  Re-establishing capitalism is the way that we need to function our economy in the American economy in the 21st century.  And is capitalism where everybody starts at a thousand instead of just zero?  Okay.  And Andrew Yang really has to ride this wave of publicity and take advantage of this.  So not only is his success not just in the realm of how many emails he got, but also in the ideological conviction where he can take a chunk out of out of the libertarians and the people that voted for Donald Trump and the moderate conservatives and even possibly the fiscal conservatives once they see that Milton Friedman actually supported the UBI.  And interestingly enough, They had an old head of the FEC on a CNN interview in which he said, you know what?  I actually think his lawyers would say if pulled in front of the FEC.  Because, yes, the FEC does not give direct advice itself.  It adjudicates events.  But there's lawyers that consult beforehand.  And I'm sure that's part of the FEC as well. ",

So that money is not the actual money given to you.  You know what I mean?  I think they, they, they, I think they talked about the actual payout.  They'll like be sponsored with another group and they'll do the payout.  Don't move the money around.  Something goofy like that.  So that's that.

But it's really interesting.  You have to look up candidates and their dollar spent per vote ratio, which is basically an electoral equivalent of a return on investment.  And I'd be curious what Andrew Yang's ROI is right now.  You know what his dollar spent per vote would be with stunts like this?  Very good.

Like I said, it seems to me the answer is who cares.  Even if it is legal, you can't get in trouble for it.  I do think there's ways you can move money around to make this work.  So I'm not too concerned about that angle of it as well.  I just, wow, what a win for Yang.  And at the same time, what a great way to really, like you said, highlight why the UBI could be so important in the first place.  Why this is not just a test and why he's planning to run this across the nation.  I think this is a great job of highlighting. ",
