            "text": "That's right, I'm doing a top 10 list.  It's not something I usually do, don't know if I'm going to do it a whole lot, but I thought it would be a fun video to visit the top 10 dumbest things that I've heard flat earthers say.  Let's start at number 10, an Einstein quote.  I don't know if people know that Einstein said this.  If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts.  That's the easy way to make the Earth move.  You might be wondering why I put this in a list of the dumb things flat earthers say.  Well, that's because Einstein never said this.  ever and all it takes is a simple search in your favorite search engine to see that this quote is simply misattributed and I believe it was Ivanka Trump who tweeted this out and then she got a lot of flack and it was a big deal.  so you'd think that people would now know that Einstein didn't say this, but here we are and flat earthers are still repeating it.  The reason I put this at the bottom is because this, I think, has the most plausible deniability.  We can give this one the benefit of the doubt, so to speak, but it only gets worse from here.  Number nine, why can't we feel the earth moving?  Movement of the Earth, whether it is the thousand mile per hour spin, wobble on its axis, or the blindingly fast speeds it's going around the sun or moving through the Milky Way, they are never observed, felt, or even recorded ever in history.  Now, I put this at the bottom of the list because this is something that not everybody might know.  I mean, you should if you went to high school.  But still.  Well, there's an easy explanation for this, of course, that you don't feel motion, instead you feel acceleration.  And while there is some acceleration of the earth spinning and revolving around the sun and the sun, there is some acceleration.  But it's very negligible because of how big the radiuses, radii, are.  I don't know why I have to explain this.  But, of course, there's plenty of reason to think that we are on a spinning globe that revolves around the sun, not the least of which being stellar aberration, which has been documented for a long time now.  There's also the trajectory of planets in the sky, which are sort of like a spirograph.  if you kids know what a spirograph is and well there's no real explanation for this on the flat earth number eight it looks flat to me then you should have the exact same effect.  looking left to right on the x-axis you should be seeing ships rolling up to the top of the ball and rolling down.  you know i mean if it's a ball it's gotta be.  they gotta be rolling both ways away from you and side to side.  We never see that, though.  You can go to the beach and do a panoramic shot, put a parallel line over it, flat.  This is a fairly common thing that you'll hear from flat earthers.  Where's the curve?  I don't see a curve.  It looks flat to me.  Of course, the Earth is just way too big to be able to see the curve from the ground.  You have to get into high altitude in order to really visibly, very clearly see the curve.  If I can find it, I'll show you the demonstration I've recorded once of just how big the Earth is.  Here is a semicircle.  Now, this demonstration is to scale, so the radius of this semicircle matches the 6,378 kilometer radius of the Earth.  Now, let's zoom in.  Keep zooming.  Keep zooming.  Keep on zooming.  Almost.  There.  The block on the left represents a 6 foot tall person, while the box on the right represents a possible width of an oil tanker at 40 meters.  Point is, Earth is so goddamn big that it looks flat from this perspective.  I mean, technically it's not, because the edges of the screen are, indeed, lower than the center.  But not enough to move even a single pixel.  Not enough to move a single pixel for a long distance.  And definitely not enough to see with the naked eye.  This is why you can't see the curve from the ground.  It's also why you can't see the curve from a mountaintop.  Number seven.  Zooming in on ships brings them back from over the horizon. ",

            "text": "I mean, it is true that with the naked eye, it's going to be a bit difficult to see a ship that's close to the horizon.  But when we zoom in with either a telescope or a really strong zoom lens on, say, a camera, yeah, it does indeed go over the horizon.  I'm going to show you an image on the screen here.  This is my favorite image from CivilWarTalk.com.  And I love bringing this image up because, well, quite frankly, it proves them wrong.  It shows exactly what they say... We wouldn't see.  That ship right there is over the horizon.  No amount of zooming is gonna bring it back.  This is indeed zoomed in pretty far.  I believe it was a Nikon P900.  I'm not entirely sure.  Gonna have to check.  Number six.  Is the Earth a sphere?  An oblate spheroid?  Or is it pear-shaped? ",

            "text": "Over the years, NASA has twice changed their story regarding the shape of the Earth.  At first they maintained Earth was a perfect sphere, which later changed to an oblate spheroid flattened at the poles.  and then changed again to being pear-shaped as the southern hemisphere allegedly bulges out as well.  Unfortunately for NASA, however, none of their official pictures show an oblate spheroid or pear-shaped Earth.  All their pictures, contrary to their words, show a spherical and clearly CGI fake Earth. ",

            "text": "The Earth overall is pretty darn close to a perfect sphere.  But it is not a perfect sphere.  It is ever so slightly an oblate spheroid.  But even that is ever so slightly not completely true, because there's an ever so slight amount more surface area in the southern hemisphere.  This is not enough to visibly see and discern when looking at an image of the entirety of the Earth.  but the surface of the Earth is not perfectly spherical.  And yet flat earthers will take this to mean that the Earth is supposed to look exactly like a pear.  Number five.  And at this point, I think we're getting to the really dumb stuff.  So what's number five?  Well, it's all perspective.  including and especially those of ships in the distance which appear to have gone down below a horizon, usually attributed to being curvature of the Earth when it is in fact simply the laws of perspective at play.  Now this is a very general point.  This isn't something that flat earthers say in response to one specific thing, but instead something that they say all the time as a... pretty much an excuse for anything and everything.  It's a matter of perspective.  This image looks curved, close to the horizon.  It's all perspective.  The southern stars?  There's a southern celestial pole that we wouldn't see and couldn't possibly see on the flat Earth.  That's also perspective.  If the Earth was flat, the Sun would take a much different route in the sky and change its angular size due to perspective that we simply don't observe.  Oh, well, that can be explained with perspective as well.  They hardly ever attempt to go any further than just perspective, such as, you know, what perspective are we talking about?  How would this perspective cause this sudden warp in the image of the sky?  It seems to me flat earthers would rather find an excuse that they find acceptable and not really question it much further than that.  Number four, let's just eyeball it.  Now this is going to take a little bit of explanation.  There's this organization called FECOR.  And this is the most scientific-looking Flat Earth organization or project that I've ever seen.  It's quite impressive how they try to be as scientific as possible while also disagreeing with every scientist for the last... couple thousand years.  So they performed an experiment, which they've released in a slideshow presentation, as scientific articles are.  They basically shined a light across a river and found out that you could see it on the other side.  The idea was that they take a very precise laser, shine it parallel to the surface of the water, and if you can see farther than you would normally see on a round earth, while it's busted.  There were a number of problems with this experiment, as you can imagine, and the biggest one, and the dumbest one, being how they leveled this laser.  From what I understand, this is a very expensive piece of equipment, a very precise, very high-powered laser.  And, well, here's how they leveled it.  To put it simply, they leveled this very expensive, very precise piece of equipment by eyeballing it.  You'd think if they have access to what they call a super accurate laser aiming device, which I don't know that that's a real acronym for this, but you would think they would also have access to, say, an optical level?  But no, apparently these guys are really good and their eyes are somehow able to tell the difference between a couple degrees from the horizontal.  All right, number three.  Gravity doesn't exist.  Um... So the science is that things rise and fall based on buoyancy and density. ",

            "text": "That's why heavy objects drop and balloons rise is not because of any magical forces pulling you to ball earth.  That's right, flat earthers don't believe in gravity for a number of reasons.  And most of the flat earthers that I hear about and deal with from time to time think that buoyancy and density accounts for gravity.  Because, you know, heavy things fall and light things float, just like in water.  This is one of the dumbest things I've heard them say.  So if you actually understood physics, you might know that buoyancy only ever pushes things upward.  Not only that, but buoyancy is caused by gravity.  I think this perfectly highlights the sort of simplistic thinking that you have to have in order to be a flat earther.  Like, oh, gravity can't exist because that... That shows so many issues with the flat earth.  Let's scrap gravity and replace it with buoyancy.  Well, when you question that and try to find out how buoyancy actually works... Well, you wouldn't be a flat earther now, would you?  A less common but far more laughable explanation is that the Earth is constantly accelerating upward.  Of course, this would mean that we would be traveling faster than the speed of light within a year, but they don't care about that because they don't care about physics.  I'm concerned about what is pushing Earth upwards 3.8 meters per second per second.  And doing this all the time, non-stop.  Wait, I guess magical thinking doesn't stop you as a flat earther.  Let's go on to number two.  And this, this is good.  Because the moon is not real.  Or at least, it's not really round.  It's not really a sphere. ",

So we believe that the moon is a sphere just because the government told us so.  Like the government never lied to you about anything and whatever they say is true.  They just looked at them through a telescope and told you an imaginary distance because it matched some triangulations and they just told you that they are spherical without even going there.

And if you want to get even crazier, the light that the moon gives off... is cold light.  It doesn't add heat to anything.  Instead, it makes things colder.  However, the moon's light is different than the sun's light.  Whereas the sun's light is warm and golden, the moon's light appears to be cool.  Cold light, if you will.  This is not how light works.  Light is radiation.  It's energy, essentially.  And that's not going to make anything colder.  It can only make things hotter.  And we can see shadows on the moon.  We can see that there are craters, mountains, and the moon wobbles.  So sometimes we see more of it than others.  Not to mention the fact that we've photographed all sides of it.  And we have some pretty pretty good images from before.  CG was anywhere near being decent.  But for some flat earthers, the lunar phases are a bit too much.  It's something that they can't quite explain.  I wonder why.  So, they have to find some sort of explanation.  Even if that explanation is the moon being fake, number one.

Now, okay, now, the first person to say this may or may not have been a troll.  Because those exist, and I've been fooled once or twice.  But whether or not the original person to say this is a troll, this has been repeated by other flat earthers.  In particular, Zach and Karen B., who together made a video that has this in it.  That's actually where I got this clip from.  I don't know where the original is.  There are some flat earthers that take this seriously.  Okay, alright, so to be clear, these guys don't think that gravity bends light, even though it does, and, well, they don't think the Earth is round, so I guess they don't really need to understand these concepts all too well, and, you know, of course they don't.  But gravity hasn't been light that much, so I guess to them, in their minds, if the Earth was round and you were on a tall enough structure or high enough mountain, you'd be able to see across the entirety of the whole world, so far as to see the back of your own head if you could zoom in far enough.  That makes sense to them.  So that's going to be the end of the video.  I hope it left you with all of your brain cells intact.  But as I said before, we are going to end every video with a reading from some sort of scripture.  So today, let's go to Dianetics, huh?  Let's go to page 126, I suppose.  At the bottom of the page, it says, \"...a Dianetic demon is a parasitic  circuit.\".  It has an action in the mind which approximates another entity than self, and it derives entirely from the words contained in engrams.  So that was, I hope you all feel very enlightened, very, I hope you now have a deeper insight into the reality of the world that we live in, and that comes to you from popular science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard.  Goodbye.  See you in the next video. ",
