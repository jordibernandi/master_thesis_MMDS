Okay, so it matters because we have to ask the question, what is this lovely person right here?  What is she?  She's lovely, she's wonderful, she's beautiful.  I'd say we all have a perspective that says that she's worthy of value, dignity, and respect.  But we have to have a basis to say that.  Because, watch this.  We have to be able to say this.  This is a random result of evolutionary processes according to our dominant secular worldview.  Right?  The universe didn't have us in mind or her in mind.  According to the predominant worldview today, she's a cosmic accident and so is this.  My worldview says, no, she's unique and in the image of God and deserves value, dignity, love, and respect.

And you are human from conception.  You're recognizing that right now by talking about the fertility clinics and the embryos.  So let me finish.  I let you finish.  Okay.  Let's be fair to each other.  Okay.  so can we be fair to each other?  i let you do two.  okay okay so may i may i please.  may i please?  you gave me two.  so ma'am ma'am if you're not going to let me finish the conversation ma'am ma'am you didn't let me finish.  you didn't let me finish.  ma'am can i finish a thought?  you had two points.  may i finish without interruption?  Okay, so number one, when you bring up the moral problem of the fertility clinic by saying those are embryos that are fertilized, you're demonstrating that you recognize that they are human and it's a problem.  The next thing is, again, I'm addressing your argument.  Feel free to respond after.  Feel free to respond after.  Next, snowflake babies.  There you go.  So that's what happened, boys.  When you get into conversations with women like this and you engage their arguments, you'll see that they don't have a way to respond.  They always walk away.  That's the critical thing to see.  No.  What's that?  Who's calling a name?  They're called snowflake.  No, no, no, no, no.  Ma'am.  Hey.  and there you go.  you should before you try to use something as an argument you feel free to ask me.  feel free to ask me.  no i say feel free to ask thank you.  so it's.  it's actually a very amazing thing where these fertilized eggs are then implanted into the uterus and these and women give birth to these babies.  there's actually a really incredible story.  an incredible story that um there's one uh human being who is actually 15 or 16 years on ice and is now running around because it's a snowflake baby, put into the womb, given a chance to grow and to develop.  And so that's what we do with them.  And Christians are doing it across the country.  But what about ectopic pregnancies?  What about the pregnancies that don't take place?  Well, I have people... And the mother needs to get that out or else they both will die.  Yeah, I have people actually in our... No, no, no.  I'm trying to answer.  I'm trying to answer.
