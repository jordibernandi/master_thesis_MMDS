            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to North Country Off Grid.  Today's video is talking about some local government issues taking place.  Before we get started with the video, if you guys are residents of Bonner County or if you know someone in the state of Idaho, please share this video on your social media networks.  to help get this message out today.  We're gonna watch a sit down meeting that was sent into us by a resident of this area.  They've asked to remain anonymous.  They are in fear of reprisal from the county if their name was to get out all which is horrible that anyone would feel the need to have to hide from their county officials for fear of retribution against them.  but they are being what they feel is targeted for their their lifestyle a traditional lifestyle of trying to homestead of trying to live off-grid.  but they feel that they are being targeted because the County here wants to clean up quote-unquote clean up the area so that they can bring in developers and they can get people in and jack up prices of land values.  and You know having tiny houses on a 20 acre lot Doesn't speak well for the 20 acre lot next to them if they're trying to get top dollar.  So guys really pay attention to this video.  I'm gonna cut in and out to kind of talk about it intermittently.  Stay tuned until the very end.  you guys are gonna hear them kind of slip up and it threw a absolute light bulb going off in my head because they're targeting someone specifically a another County member someone who lives in this area and They're targeting them specifically.  One of the commissioners talks about it.  And then the guy who's at the podium, who is the planning director, he hushes them up real quick and says, let's save it for an executive meeting, which is a private meeting, guys, that the public is not allowed in.  So behind closed doors, they are targeting a citizen.  So wait till the end.  It's a bit of a longer video.  not cool guys.  Uh, I'm glad this was sent to me.  I'm glad this was brought to my attention.  Of course, a lot of the people who are sending me stuff, uh, privately, they don't have a platform to speak on.  They're just a lone person getting the same letters in the mail that I got.  The difference is, is I have this platform to bring it to light guys.  Uh, so here goes the video.  2019. ",

What they're going to be talking about here shortly after they kind of get through the mumbo jumbo is going to be whether or not they should allow you to stay on your property, camp out on your property for more than 120 days on your private property.

Bill's got a nice cloth to get an air.  Okay.  I'm tight.  Sorry, I got us off track.  That was me.  That's all right.  So department updates, we're rocking along.  We are fully staffed.  The person that we've hired to replace our exiting intern won't start for another month and a half or so, but that's okay.  We're still excited about that.  That's happening.  Moving on the agenda, zoning ordinance updates, Title 11 and Title 12.  The ordinance updates, we're working on some ordinance updates for Title 11.  We haven't presented anything to the Planning and Zoning Commission.  Title 12 updates, we have a file in front of the PNC Commission next week.  Mostly just rearranging the order of the subdivision section for minor land division and shore plan.  We'll bring that to you after the PNC Commission makes a recommendation in a week.  We had a workshop last week with the Planning and Zoning Commission on recreational vehicles.  Right now, a recreational vehicle, according to the code, occupancy of a recreational vehicle on a lot or parcel shall not exceed 120 days in any 12-month period.  not including RV parks.  So if you have an RV on your property, according to this code, you can only stay in it for 120 days in any 12 month period.  And then it says RV occupancy is limited to one vehicle per lot or parcel.  So you can have one RV on your property and you can only stay in it for 120 days.  So we've had lots of requests to change this.  We don't enforce this because I don't have a meter made with a chalk strip to go out and chalk the tires. ",

We're talking about rural property.  County property out here.  We're talking in the county excuse me.  We're talking about Property in the middle of the woods and when they find out that you have an RV They think that you should only be allowed to stay there for 120 days.

Guys, just because they're not using drones just yet, when you see the intent of wanting to do it in this area to keep control of people, they eventually will be using drones.  The more they tax, the more they raise fines, the more money that they get, they will then spend it on stuff.  Tax and spend, you'll see with Bonner County, they like doing that.  They tax you more, then they spend more, and then they come back years later asking for more.  It's why these county commissioners make $86,000 a year, I think is what it is.

So the PNC Commission has held a workshop on this.  They'll hold another workshop on it.  The other thing they considered was in the commercial use table, the RV park, recreational vehicle parks are allowed in the commercial, rural service center, recreation, and alpine village zones with a conditional use permit.  We've tagged a couple properties in the last year for starting to build an RV park in the rural zones.  So there were some folks at the hearing with the PNC Commission from these rural zones that have started these RV parks that we've made them stop.  And so they had some input onto why we should allow RV parks in a rural zone.  So the Planning and Zoning Commission is still going to keep working on this.  There's not been a final document written yet, a proposal, but that's what the Planning and Zoning Commission is working on regarding this.  Title 12 updates, you're going to continue to see updates from us on the code.  We continue to find things in the code that present challenges when working with applicants for land use files.  So... I've got a question, Melvin.  So on the RV... So it still would be not... something that we wanted to see.  is people living full-time in an rv correct on a parcel or would that be all right?  is that the way we're headed? ",

They seem a little perplexed as to what they should do, and I would offer up this statement.  It's none of your business what people do on their property or how people choose to live on their property.  I'm not sure where these guys feel like.  they got the end-all be-all answers to whether or not people get to.  they should not be under the impression that they are in control of how people live on their properties.

I see it as, you know, as a temporary structure in why you're building your home or something.  But, boy, as far as living in it, yeah.  With the right circumstances, it's doable, especially if it's on a private property.  Because you can put a shed, you can put a roof over it, a snow roof over it, which people do.  Some of them build a complete pole barn and put the RV inside the pole barn.  We don't even know it's there.  Right.  And they're living in it year-round.  Obviously, it'll come proper down.  Right.  I've built houses for people that they had a pole barn set up to put their RV in it.  stay there until their house is complete and then about half the time they sell the RV after the house is finished.  So maybe it's just a matter of extending the period of time.  Yeah.  Not that we have the ability.  A place to stay when the house is being built.  Well, and so one of the suggestions that came up out of that meeting was to allow up to two permanent RV spots on property.  Again, this is so raw and in the very beginning stage.  But that was some of the discussion from the workshop Thursday.  Nothing's been written.  Nothing's down on paper.  But this is where these things start to come to life.  these ordinance changes, these workshops, and so we thought we advertised it pretty good.  We did get some public there to provide input on what they'd like to see.  as far as RVs on properties and RV parks.  Okay.  I'll be waiting to see the next update.  Okay, next is enforcement.  Adam, do you have anything?  Complaints seem to be up this month for some reason, a variety of them, so it's not consistent.  Okay.  Well, that's it.  How many things have you issued this month?

Guys, and I believe this, this is something we're gonna dig into.  I think I can find the owner of this property and we're gonna go and talk to him and see how much harassment that they've faced from the planning and zoning department.

And now the county thinks that they're entitled to tell him to move it.  I'm assuming.  That's an assumption 100%, guys.
