            "text": "Oh, tourists.  Where do you come from?  I'm from Israel.  From Israel.  Now, what color was Moses?  What color?  Moses.  Yeah, king.  Moses.  I don't know for sure.  You don't know for sure.  But it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter?  Yeah, no.  So does it matter that there's a case of identity theft?  Case of identity theft?  You know what identity theft is?  What?  You know, when somebody else is stealing somebody else's identity.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  Okay, now, you say that you're a Jew.  Right?  We're saying that we're Jews.  Is that possible for us to be a Jew and you to be a Jew?  Yes.  Why?  Because why?  I just came back from Israel for the Pesach, right?  I went to customs.  The guy asked me, my son name is Zadok.  The guy asked me, why do you name your son Zadok?  So is the name, is it only for Jewish people or is it for people of the Bible?  So you know what else he asked me?  They asked me, who bought your ticket?  So they're showing you that there's no equality.  It's a lot of ignorance.  Ignorance, right.  So now, what you're going to find out, that you are standing before the true sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  That's right.  You say you are Jewish, but that is not Israel.  Give me Revelation 2 and 9.  Revelation 2, verse 9.  Revelation chapter 2 verse 9 I know thy works and tribulation and poverty.  God said he knows the work of the real Jews.  we're the real Jews Yehuda.  okay we are the real Jews.  okay come on but thou art rich but we're rich why?  because the kingdom of heaven belongs to us.  come on and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews.  the Bible says I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews come on and are not and who and are not and what And are not.  And are not.  But who are they?  But are the synagogue of Satan.  But are the synagogue of Satan.  So now, your ancestors, your rabbi, he taught you a lie.  He taught you a lie.  Let me show you something.  What does this say?  What does this say?  What does this book say?  The invention of Jewish people.  So when you invent something, what do you do?  Brother, what do you do?  When you invent something, what do you do?  You create it.  So what?  What was created?  Jewish people.  Okay?  No way the Torah doesn't mention Jewish people.  So then what?  That was made up.  That was made up.  There's no Jewish.  Ish means pertaining to.  The suffix.  There's Judah.  Okay, there is Jews, but there's no Jewish in the Torah.  Is that correct?  Yes or no?  No.  Yes or no?  No.  Okay, no.  So that means that what?  That it was invented.  Jewish people were invented.  Okay, there's no such thing as Jewish people in the Torah.  Give me Revelation 3 verse 9.  Revelation chapter 3 verse 9.  Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan.  I will make them of the synagogue of Satan.  Come on.  Which say they are Jews.  You said that you're Jewish.  Come on.  And are not.  And who?  And are not.  And what?  And are not.  So you are not a Jew, Yehuda.  Okay.  Come on.  But do lie.  But what?  But do lie.  You know what?  It's not your fault.  Because your rabbi, he lied to you.  The rabbi lied to you.  You are standing before the true son of Abraham Isaac and Jacob.  Okay, come on.  Behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet.  So that's what's going to happen to these Lazarus.  You're going to worship before the real Jew.  That's right.  Do you believe that?  Give me Jeremiah 14 verse 2.  They lied to him the same way they lied to us.  Right.  They lied to everybody.  They lied to everybody.  Okay, they lied to everybody.  Okay.  Read that.  Jeremiah chapter 14 verse 2.  Judah mourned and against their own language.  They are black.  They are who?  They are black.  They are what?  They are black.  So the Bible says the real Jews are black.  Come on.  Unto the ground.  Unto the ground.  Different shades of brown.  Okay.  So you've never heard this Bible taught like this before.  Give me Isaiah 29 and 22.  And Jeremiah 3 and 15.  We're going to lock it up with that.  Okay, Malcolm X said that, he said, you don't need any weapon against the white man.  All you need is what?  Is the truth.  The truth shall make you free.  Okay?  You don't want to hear that.  You don't want to hear it, but this is why it's the truth.  Okay, read that.  You got Isaiah 29, verse 22.  Come on.  Therefore, thus saith the Most High.  Thus saith the Most High God.  Come on.  Who redeemed Abraham?  concerning the house of Jacob.  So this is Jacob.  Jacob is the father of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Jacob shall not be ashamed.  Neither shall his face now wax pale.  When the so-called white man came to America, what did the so-called Indians call the white man?  What did the Indians call a white man when they came to America?  Pale face.  Read it again.  Therefore, thus said the Most High, who redeemed Abraham concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.  Neither shall his face now wax pale.  It is impossible according to the Torah for the real Jews to be Caucasian, to have a pale face.  You are standing before the true son of Abraham Isaac and Jacob.  Give me Jeremiah 3 and 15.  Jeremiah 3 and 15.  Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15.  And I will give you pastors according to my heart which shall feed you.  You are getting fed, Father, not with food, not with physical food.  with spiritual food.  Look at Jeremiah 3, verse 15.  And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.  Knowledge and understanding.  You've learned more in the past 20 minutes than you've probably learned in the last 20 years.  Tell me I'm lying.  No, you're not, sir.  You're absolutely right.  He stole it.  He stole it.  The Mosai is calling you, brother.  Are you going to take me to this call?  You got to make time.  I know you got a work schedule, but you got to pray to the Mosai God that he will make a way for you.  Because when America gets destroyed, you want to be for surety that God is going to save you in his last days.  Because many are called for what?  For being chosen.  You got to make your election sure.  Make the election sure, brother.  Don't put up for tomorrow what you can do today.  So what did you find out today?  That you are the tribe of Levi, the nation of Israel.  You are no more Haitian, no more black man, no more African.  If I ask you right now again, what's your nationality, what are you going to tell me?  You are Levi, tribe of Levi.  of what nation?  Of the nation of Israel.  Alright, give the brother a hand.  This is the world's best-kept secret.  They've been hiding this from generation to generation.  But what did the Bible prophecy say?  That this gospel shall be preached in the last days.  That all those that are supposed to hear this word are going to hear it.  And they're going to receive it.  And they're going to repent and come back to the lowest stat of commandments, the Most High God.  Read that.  Look at St.  John chapter 8 verse 32.  Come on.  And ye shall know the truth.  And what?  And ye shall know the truth.  And ye shall know the truth.  Come on.  And the truth shall make you free.  And what?  And the truth shall make you free.  Your mind is set free now, brother.  You don't have to be in that mental slavery.  You don't have to depend on these brutal tricks or wearing lucky charms to keep evil away from you.  Just walk in the law, stat of commandments, the most I thought, and what?  He's going to keep angels encamped around you.  So before you leave, would you like us to anoint you, brother?  Can we anoint you?  We did that in the, give me that in the Numbers 6 and 23.  I'm going to read the prayer in English first, and then we're going to do it in Hebrew.  Read that.  Numbers chapter 6, verse 23.  Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise... This is a prayer that Aaron, high priest, and Moses, they used to bless the children of Israel.  Okay, come on.  You shall bless the children of Israel.  You shall do what?  You shall bless the children of Israel.  See, we are here.  We want to bless the children of Israel.  Come on.  Saying unto them.  Come on.  The Lord bless thee.  Lord what?  The Lord bless thee.  We want the Lord to bless you, brother.  That's why we're here.  Come on.  And keep thee.  The Lord.  And keep thee.  And keep thee.  Come on.  The Lord make his face shine upon thee.  The Lord make his face shine upon you.  Come on.  And be gracious unto thee.  And be what?  And be gracious unto thee.  And be gracious unto you.  Come on.  The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee.  The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee.  Come on.  And give thee peace.  And give thee what?  And give thee peace.  You want peace, brother?  That's why we're here, brother.  This is your family.  This is your new family right here.  That's right.  Okay?  This is your new family.  We are brothers from another mother.  That's right.  Okay?  Now, out of all the people that were out here tonight, okay, there was one soul that the Mosai is looking for.  Okay?  There were at least a couple hundred people out here, but only one stayed to the end.  So Mosai is looking at you saying, what, that you're worthy, that you are special unto him.  So don't turn away from the Lord's word.  Okay?  Don't take this lightly, what you saw tonight, the words that you saw tonight.  Okay?  These words are going to lead you in the road to salvation, to repentance.  Okay?  We're going to do this same, when we read it in English, we're going to do it in the last one, that's the ancient Hebrew.  Yabaraka!  Yabaraka!  Yahawa.  Waya shamaka.  Waya shamaka.  Yahawa.  Yahawa.  Yasha'ar Yahawa.  Yasha'ar Yahawa.  Waya waya ka.  Waya waya ka.  Waya kanka.  Waya kanka.  Yahawa.  Yahawa.  Yasha'ar Yahawa.  Yasha'ar Yahawa.  Waya waya.  What's your name brother?  Sonny.  Sonny.  Yahawabasha.  Yahawabasha.  Yahawasha.  Yahawasha.  Barakwapa.  Barakwapa.  Yashara.  Yashara.  Our contact numbers there, our address, you drive?  All right, so you live in Miami?
