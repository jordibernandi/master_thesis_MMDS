In 2019, he decided to convert it into an arcade and restaurant, which should have been a straightforward process since the property was already zoned for commercial use.  But a community activist incurring nothing more than a $600 fee was able to temporarily scuttle Mucha's plans, forcing him to spend months rallying community support and pleading his case at a public hearing.  Joey the Cat's new outpost is slated to open in spring of 2021, but the story of how the project was nearly stopped and what Mucha endured in order to prevail underscores how even the most benign land use changes in San Francisco can be hampered by red tape.  It's a root cause of the city's housing crisis and jeopardizes San Francisco's competitiveness over the long term. ",

Neither Ortiz nor Cultural Action Network responded to our interview request.  Even though these reviews are supposed to be used only under exceptional and extraordinary circumstances, they've become a regular part of the city's land use process.  For example, the owner of a falafel restaurant was able to delay the opening of a competitor by claiming that the neighborhood already had enough falafel.  This home's third floor addition was blocked on the grounds that it wasn't sufficiently Victorian.  The conversion of a laundromat to an apartment building has been delayed for over five years due in part to its casting a shadow on an already shaded schoolyard.  So far in 2019, the Planning Commission publicly heard 91 requests for discretionary review.  Because every building permit in the city is subject to this process, it adds enormous costs to construction, exacerbating the city's severe housing shortage.  Mucha prevailed by devoting enormous time to winning over community support, which otherwise would have gone into running his business. ",

I've watched a bunch of planning commission hearings and research to kind of understand the concept because small business owners shouldn't be flung into this process and and expected to be perfect at this when the activists are going to these almost weekly.  I've gotten a profile on all the different planning commissioners.  I know their names and I know kind of what they vote for and against.  My team and I went and garnered as much support as we could from the community.  And we've worked with architects and had to figure out how to make this space work for both what I want it to be and what is legally permitted and make good business sense out of it.  And finding that triangulation is incredibly complex and challenging and has been a very burdensome process for a small business owner. ",
