I have a very great respect for Jordan Peterson.  But let me give you an illustration.  In Ohio, Columbus, Ohio, there's a building called the Wexner Center for the Arts, supposedly the first postmodern building.  And I asked the person, what is a postmodern building?  I know what postmodern philosophy is.  What's a postmodern building?  He said, well, the architect said if life itself has no purpose, why should our buildings have any purpose?  And so he built it with no particular purpose in mind.  You know, stairways that go nowhere. ",

And so to me, when Peterson talks of absolutes, when Peterson talks of right and wrong, not so much right and left, but right and wrong, his conclusions are very good.  But the only reason I think those conclusions stand, if there is an ultimate, eternal purpose for life itself.  Otherwise, it's just one ideology against another, especially, dare I suggest, because of a pluralistic society in which we live.  People start from different points in the beginning of the argument, and that, to me, is where I think there is the weakness.

And I said to him, we are meant to be equal as people, but not all ideas are equal.  We have reversed it.  We have made an elitism of people and an egalitarianism of ideas, and that is flawed.  as a starting point.  So if I respect all of my fellow human beings, regardless of what their view is, and see them of intrinsic worth, not worth given by the government or state, but an intrinsic valuable entity, we can converse and dialogue and ultimately truth will triumph in the end.
