            "text": "i will bring out a secret and i will fight myself and isis shall begin to tremble at the sound of the trumpet of the lord.  most high blow the trumpet.  Do you hear the sound of the trumpet?  Do you hear the sound of the trumpet?  Blow the trumpet in Zion, for I shall arise in Zion, says the Lord.  Go!  And during that time, great prophets shall arise from the earth and they shall stand and reveal.  These are not prophets that are necessarily in the religious organizations, but prophets like I chose, Netanyahu, Rudy Giuliani.  Oh, you may mock him, but I made him a watchman in this country.  the hatred for this nation has increased but i will not allow isis to take the young men of this nation whom i have planned to be my spokesman and use them.  says the lord i shall send my prophet to israel when they vote and God says there shall be a change and many will weep.  but I will take Netanyahu whether ruler or not and they shall call to him for he is not just a king he is a prophet.  therefore tremble when peace treaties begin For God says at that point, you shall know that I look from my heavens and that which has kept me back shall begin to be fulfilled.  All the words of the prophets that have been spoken through the centuries shall be fulfilled and shall begin to be fulfilled quickly.  Study the word, says the Lord.  Study to show yourself approved.  And when these things happen, rejoice, for your redemption draws nigh.  I will not allow my people to fall, but I will bring light, light, light into Iraq.  I will bring light into Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, yes, Syria, and Iran.  A massive revival.  that will affect China and will affect Russia as well.  And Putin shall have no control for what I shall do.  I will slay him, says the Lord.  This day has come for vengeance.  What did we do to Israel?  But I shall retrieve it and place a David who shall be a burning bush in the White House to bring fire and revival to this nation and to South America and to Central America and to Canada and to many nations and throughout Europe.  as they begin to hate my people more they shall go and they shall go back to Israel to their land and then fire shall burn in Israel more fire than ever before and the people will know.  I the Lord have intervened and made this happen.  Say this to the Lord. ",
