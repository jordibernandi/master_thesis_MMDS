He's actually part of the Heritage Foundation and he's one of the best speakers I've heard when it comes to the idea of the libertarian movement and conservatism.  because obviously in culture today there's a growing libertarian movement but I generally consider myself a conservative.  So what's really the difference?  and maybe which one makes more sense for our nation? ",

And what has happened is that in this alliance, the mind of conservatism was kind of colonized and taken over by the rhetoric of libertarianism.  So there's a real problem amongst conservatives.  The default rhetorical setting for us is to speak of less government, more liberty.  Now, don't get me wrong.  That is one component of what conservatism is. ",

So a conservative is someone who recognizes that individuals have rights and they are free, but then realizes that the individual is embedded in various communities.  The first one is the family.  Individuals don't drop from the sky ready-made when they're born to parents who raised them.  These families in turn belong to churches.  These churches are embedded by civil society, which in turn is embedded in a state, which in turn is embedded in a country.  And a conservative is someone who thinks of the individual in relation to this and also via the lens of an intergenerational compact.  You and I are probably the same generation, but there's a generation that came before us, and here's the key one, one that will come after us.  And a conservative is someone who looks to the future.  The mission statement for conservatism, I would say, is found in the preamble to the Constitution.  It is to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.  It's not just for us.  We need to think about how these policies affect the future, the next generation.  Are they sustainable? ",
