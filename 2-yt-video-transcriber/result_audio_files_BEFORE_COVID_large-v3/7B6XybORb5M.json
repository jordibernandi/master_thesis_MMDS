Absolutely.  You can't just nod your head.  They don't see you.  Gunfight.  Yeah, I want the gun because the knife can really, really jack you up.  Like you don't have to be skilled with a knife.  or in this case of a video, you're going to see a machete to really ruin someone's day.  Okay, well, maybe we'll talk in later videos about the reason knives are so dangerous.  But for the sake of just enjoying a fun Friday, folks, I have looped together about a seven or eight second video.  Let's say I'll look at five times for you to watch where the perfect mix of machete, and momentum and just all around uh i'll find you liam neeson and kill you skill meet in the perfect storm and i don't know where this is.  this is brazil africa.  i don't know wherever it's at.  i would never do what this guy did even if i felt that i could.  this was.  this is unbelievable.  you'll see that it's unbelievable.  watch it like five times and then tell a friend okay good day um um.
