            "text": "Do you know of the secret angels?  Angels that you've even encountered in your life.  In the book of mysteries it's called the mystery of the secret angels.  The teacher leads the disciple up a high desert mountain into a cave and near its summit inside the cave not far from the entrance is an engraving of a human-like figure with outstretched wings.  An angel.  There, the teacher uncovers the mystery of the secret angels.  An angel.  What is an angel?  What do we know of angels?  Well, they're heavenly creatures sent by God with wings.  But then again, they don't all have wings.  There are many different kinds of angels.  Cherubim.  We think of cherubs, little babies.  Well, they're not little babies.  Seraphim.  There are warring angels, ministering angels, angels that bear news.  But then there are the other kinds of angels.  Who are they?  The secret angels.  They're the earth angels.  Who are they?  They walk the earth in flesh and blood.  They are God's earthbound division.  They're different from the other angels, but they're angels nonetheless.  Now you think, oh, wow, what are you saying?  Well, the scriptures give a word.  The word for angel in Hebrew is the word malach.  Try it, malach, an angel of the Lord.  In the New Testament, The scripture gives the word in Greek, angelos, we get the word angel, angelos.  So it's written, though, in the Hebrew scriptures, it speaks of Haggai, this is a man of flesh and blood, and calls him the Lord's malach, the angel.  Why?  Because he was a messenger, a servant of God, sent by God, and he's actually called a malach, an angel, same exact word.  Well, then if you read the New Testament, you know the man, of course, called John the Baptizer, the Baptist.  It wasn't his real name.  It was Yohanan the Baptizer.  But he was the one who heralded Messiah.  And it says of him, it says, this is him of whom it's written, behold, I will send my angelos.  It's actually the word angelos.  Haggai and John were both of flesh and blood, and yet in the Bible they are both called angels, the exact same word used of the other angels of God.  Why?  How?  An angel is one that is sent by God.  An angel is a messenger.  The word angelos leads to message.  It's an emissary on a divine assignment, not of the world, but ministering to the world, bringing God's message, especially to those who dwell on this planet.  So who are the secret angels?  Who are the earth angels?  They are those who are born again.  We are born.  If you're born again, you are born not from earth.  You're born from above.  You're born from heaven.  That's your origin.  The secret angels are those who bear the message of heaven to those who dwell on this planet.  And what's the message?  It's the good news.  Well, what's the good news called?  In Greek, it's called the euangel.  In English, it's the evangel.  We get the word evangelism.  Now, do you ever think about that?  In the middle of the word evangelism, circlet is the word angel.  Why?  Because that's exactly what an angel does.  The angel bears the message of heaven to those on earth.  And so if you take this up, and you follow the assignment of God, and you bear this message to bring good news, the divine message of those on earth, you become his earth angel.  You become his secret angel.  Don't just live your life as someone who's from earth, and you're an earthling, that's all you are.  No, live your life as someone on assignment.  In the world, but what does it say?  Not of the world.  You're not from the earth anymore.  You're born again.  You are to the earth.  You are here on assignment.  Every day, you're to seek God for your angelic mission.  What does God have for you?  Every day, live your life from heaven on mission to bring good news to those who dwell in darkness, to accomplish the will of God, to do great things for God.  For you are no longer just you.  You are actually one of God's secret angels.  Now, an end time mystery from thousands of years ago. ",
