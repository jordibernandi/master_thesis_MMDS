Prices of things shooting out high, in fact, tripled the price here in Ghana.  But it's a good thing to give room.  for flasks of Africans outside Ghana to visit home and come and see so many things.  In fact, not everyone would just stand by themselves and say, oh, I'm going home, I'm going to see Africa, I'm going to see Ghana, where I actually feel so.  But this has given opportunity to so many people to be here in Ghana at this very moment because of what... We are saying year of return.  And I believe when they come, they get the opportunity to visit places, places such as Cape Post, Elmina Castle, in fact, where the whole thing actually started from, where they had to enslave, you know, the blacks there.  The processes they went through and all that, it gives them the opportunity to go and see such places and see how they actually migrated to where they are now.  So I believe it's a very good thing.  They come not just to come and have fun, but come and learn and see how they got there in the first place.  And that should also give them the opportunity to see the beautiful place that they come from, Africa. ",
