            "text": "Don't walk into a coin shop and say, I don't know anything about coins.  What will you pay me for these?  I trust you.  That's why I'm here.  Because some dealers, not all, some dealers pay based off of who you are, what you say.  Stay tuned because we're going to talk about this.  My name is Daniel and you are watching Coin.  Help You.  Thanks for watching my latest video.  Today we're going to talk about dealers and how much they pay people when they walk into their shop or try to sell coins to them.  Now, I know that there are some dealers, and this is a small number of dealers, that no matter who walks into their shop, they're lowballing everybody as low as they can go.  Now, they're in business, they're trying to buy the coins, they're giving you cash, and they pretty much justify this is what we pay.  I mean, if you don't want to sell it to us, that's fine.  I understand.  I know that some can take advantage of others who don't know anything about coins.  So when they walk into their shop, they basically lump all the, let's say worst in quarters.  for instance, they just lump all the 32 Ds and Ss along with the rest of them and buy them at melt or less than melt.  I know there's some dealers that do that, but on a grander scale, on a larger scale nationwide or even worldwide, let's say this big community of sellers, that actually have established values that they pay for coins based off a silver spot, based off a gold spot, or just coins in general.  For instance, Atmex pays a certain amount and Arizona Coin pays a certain amount.  Atlanta Gold and Coin Buyers pays a certain amount.  We pay a certain amount.  One of the things that we do here at the shop, we have a certain amount.  we pay for silver, gold, a certain percentage, and also certain key dates based off of gray sheet.  And it doesn't matter if you come into our shop not knowing anything about coins.  We're still going to pay those prices.  We're going to search your coins and we're going to look at your coins.  And we're going to tell you if you have something.  Now, we don't go through pocket change all the time, but we will go through collections that have some coins that might have a key date in there.  If we actually need the coin and we don't have an abundance of the coin, we will pay more.  based off of that.  But if someone brings in a bunch of common stuff, we have a set price that we pay for and that's how much we pay.  Some dealers are not like that.  Some dealers, they try to read you and if they think they can buy lower than the national average, they're going to buy lower.  So my advice to you is to actually know a little bit about the coins.  Do your research.  Watch some of my videos.  That way, when you go into the dealership, you are better prepared to sell your coins.  You have a better idea of what the prices are.  And even if you really don't know the value or how to grade, if you start talking like you looked up the prices, you saw this in the price guide, yeah, they're going to tell you, well, you know, that's retail and this and that.  But at least establish the fact that you do know something about coins.  The worst thing you can do is walk into a coin shop and say, I don't know anything about coins.  How much will you pay me?  Please don't do that.  That's like the worst thing you could do.  I know that some dealers are going to be like, man, what's wrong with you?  How are you going to ruin our business?  Or how are you going to do this?  Look, nationally as dealerships, we are responsible for being the brokers of coins.  And to be brokers of coins, you need to be professional.  So we need to establish a professionalism in the hobby.  I know there are plenty of mom and pop, small dealers and large dealers.  They've been doing it a long time.  They deal with high-end clients.  They know how to treat people and they cater to people and they cater to collectors.  They cater to people that they buy from and sell to.  That is what we do here.  That is what we established at our coin shop.  And that's how we conduct ourselves.  You know, I don't know why a dealership itself wouldn't want to be the hub for education and buying and selling in their area to actually foster trust and trust.  spur people to collect because they know that they can trust you completely.  More people would collect because it's so confusing.  They don't know where to turn to.  They don't know who to go to.  You know, I always said the measure of a person is how they treat someone when they have nothing to gain from them.  It's the same thing when people walk into your dealership.  The measure of your dealership is how you treat people when you have nothing to gain from them.  So anyways, I just kind of wanted to cover that.  It's kind of a fast video, but Just don't go into a coin shop and say, I don't know anything about coins, how much would you give me for them?  And if the guy's him hauling around and doesn't act like he really knows what he's doing or he's trying to lump all the coins together, you might want to question a little bit or just walk out with your coins.  You don't have to sell to one dealer.  You've got all kinds of dealers you can go to.  So anyways, thanks for watching my latest video.  Please like, share, and comment, and have a great day. ",
