            "text": "The Atheist Debates Patreon Project presents Religion and the Mind, part one.  Hi, everybody.  I'm gonna be doing a part two to this.  And so this is kind of like the introductory steps because part two is gonna address far more issues related to mental health.  One of the foundational ideas behind this is that we have limits on what we can know and understand about reality.  We recognize those limits.  But a god is supposed to be this perfect, unlimited being, and so if you're a god and you create human beings and you stick them in a world and you give them a brain to understand that world, it would seem unreasonable to punish those creatures for coming to incorrect conclusions when they don't have sufficient information, when they don't have sufficient mental faculties.  And this video is going to take a look at an imaginary scenario where we look at an optimal, not perfect, but optimal human brain.  A brain that, while it's not perfect, is capable of reasoning at the highest levels, is less prone to jumping to conclusions or making bad inferences than the average brain, a brain that can consider complex subjects, that can evaluate, you know, hey, am I a brain in a vat?  Do I have any way of knowing?  They can get to the foundations of, you know, falsifiability.  Is there a way to show that this idea that I'm holding or that someone is proposing is not true?  Epistemology is the label that we use for the field of study and philosophy of how do we know what we know?  And while it's far too complicated to go into in a short video here.  Imagine that my brain is as close to optimal as we could possibly get.  What limitations do I still have?  Well, I still have to begin with an assumption that I'm in a reality that is shared with other people because it's something I can't demonstrate.  I can't prove that I'm not in a simulation.  And by prove, we're talking about not just demonstrating to an absolute certainty, but I'm talking about we can't demonstrate that at all.  It is reasonable to continue operating based on what you experience in the world.  Like, for example, if I just decide that everything I'm experiencing is a fiction created by somebody else, I'm probably going to get hit by a bus crossing the street because I'm going to be out and about and not believe that that's a bus coming towards me, or not believe that the bus is real, or not believe that what I'm experiencing is real.  And a lot of people will look at this and say, well, you know, it's because your senses are limited.  We know that you can fool your senses.  There's optical illusions, great ones, that can confuse you as to color and shape and distance, relative proportions, all sorts of things like that.  There are auditory illusions, the Yanny Laurel thing and other stuff like that.  We experience all of these things, and they serve as a constant reminder that our brains are not perfect.  that our sensory input is not perfect.  And I want to pause here to address something because yes, everything that you've ever experienced is a construct of your brain.  You create in your mind a model of reality And this is based on whatever sensory input you think you're getting.  Not necessarily what sensory input you are getting, but what sensory input you think you are getting.  Because your eyes, when they look at an optical illusion, are not providing information to your brain that is flawed.  As far as we can tell, your eyes are providing decent information to your brain, unless there's some sort of issue with your eyes.  And we're so good at detecting this that we can identify people who are colorblind, people who are People who have bad vision and need glasses and need corrective lenses.  We have such a good understanding of how this works that we can offer corrective measures for people whose eyes don't function optimally.  Not everybody.  We're doing it for auditory stuff as well, including cochlear implants that are allowing people to hear.  We can find out how accurate your sensory information is, and yet it's still nothing that we can claim as a certainty because all of it is created in the brain.  The confusion over the color in an optical illusion is a product of your brain, not your eyes.  Your eyes didn't get that wrong.  Your brain interpreted it wrong.  Our understanding and knowledge that we can do this, that we're going to get some things wrong, put us in a really peculiar position.  And that is a complete and total lack of certainty about anything.  And that means that our confidence in things needs to have some way of being tested.  Now, while I can't prove that I'm not the only living human being on the planet, if I work under the operating assumption that I share a reality with other people, then it seems to me that the first step is, hey, did you see what I saw?  Or did you see what I think I saw?  Or do you think you see what I thought I saw?  Independent confirmation from somebody else.  That's how we determine, you know, if I look at that and say, what color is it?  What color is it?  What color is it?  To thousands of people, and we start getting consistent answers, reality essentially becomes defined by almost a majority perception.  But we know... that we can't be perfect thinkers, and we know that our understanding and model of reality is flawed.  It provides some incredibly fun, interesting, and educational thought experiments within philosophy.  When we're talking about qualia and Mary in the color room and things like that, where she supposedly knows everything about red, the brain in the vat sort of things, the new evil demon sort of things, where how do you know that you're not being fed a reality by someone trying to trick you?  But if we took a brain that was functioning as optimally as possible, it would still be prevented from confirming, currently, anything supernatural, or that there is anything supernatural, and more specifically, a God, because a God falls into that.  And yet, there are people who believe that there's a God who created us, who put us in reality, who gave us a brain to figure reality out, gave us consistent experiments.  Wow, I'm adding extra plurals onto everything.  Talk about a brain that's not functioning optimally today.  gave us this information, gave us access to this information, gave us the tool to process the information, gave us other people with which we can work to figure out how accurate our understanding of this information is, and then would punish us for not coming to the right conclusion about something that they are intentionally hiding.  And I say intentionally hiding because the God prospect God proposition is that there's a perfect mind and if that mind is perfect it would have to understand the limitations of our mind and as the individual that created our mind with these limitations it's absurd for that God to expect us to exceed those limitations expect us to reach conclusions that aren't warranted in any way by evidence.  Religions quite often rely on a leap of faith.  It's something that they're both simultaneously proud of and ashamed of in many religions when you talk to them.  Because they don't want it to be viewed as blind faith.  It's not like.  I just ran off and decided there's a God for no reason.  No, it's not like that.  You ran off and decided there's a God for bad reasons.  You ran off and decided there's a God because of... emotional reasons, about a discomfort with not knowing, or a fear of death, or a fear of being alone, or fear of not being loved, you went off and decided there's a God out of discomfort with giving an answer like, I don't know, to questions of why is there something rather than nothing.  Instead of recognizing the limitations of our ability to explore and understand the universe, and recognizing that the most accurate answer in most situations is going to be, I don't know, That was uncomfortable, and so people offered up notions about gods.  But if you view this, put yourself in God's shoes, if I were God, and you created beings, and then sought to reward or punish them based on their ability to cognitively understand, reach a conclusion, and then act in accordance with that conclusion.  I'm not... for the Christians out there that were like, it's not just about whether or not you believe in Jesus, it's about whether or not you follow Jesus and accept Jesus as Christ and live a Christ-like life.  I get all that.  The point is, none of you are perfect thinkers.  And even if you were the best possible thinker, you are still prohibited by the nature of reality, the facts of reality, the fact that you don't have access to your sense data.  You have access only to the interpretation of that sense data.  And we have no evidence that leads to these particular conclusions.  You are limited.  You are a being that can only do the best you can, and your best can never be good enough to warrant reaching a conclusion about a god.  And this is for properly functioning brains.  How did you, you know, oh, well, I just can't think of a better reason.  You know, why is there something rather than nothing?  God did it.  Well, okay, how did you rule out the universe creating pixies?  Oh, well, but I'm talking about prophecy.  Prophecy is the reason that I believe in God.  Okay, show me a prophecy.  Well, it says in Daniel that such and such, and now we see this over here.  Okay, I've done videos before on prophecy and that they need to be specific, answerable by a single set of circumstances, not prone to interpretation,  etc.,  But even if we had a prediction written down that was very specific, that then came true, you wouldn't be able to say that the person who made that prediction actually knew that it would come true.  people actively working to make it come true.  That sort of, you know, if someday Israel will be a state, well, if there's people working to make Israel a state, you don't get to claim that this is prophecy fulfilled any more than when I say somebody's going to name their kid, you know, Jim Bob.  Or someday there's going to be a woman president of the United States of America.  That's not a particularly impressive prediction.  It's not really a someday.  It's not specific when you say someday.  Those limitations in our mind put us in a position where there's no model of God that is reasonable and consistent with our reasoning other than we don't know.  Now, as we run around and try to make sense of the world, we have certain methods that we use for this.  The collection of evidence.  Independent confirmation that I talked about earlier.  Within the scientific fields, that's essentially peer review.  I did this experiment.  I got this result.  Here's all my data and everything else.  Would one of you guys see if you get the same result?  Yep, I did it.  I got the same result.  Hey, hang on.  I did it over here and I didn't get the same result.  Now we're going to investigate to see which one of us made a mistake or if maybe the universe doesn't operate as regularly as we assumed that it did.  when we began the experiment.  Maybe there's some randomness involved.  Maybe there's something else going on that we don't know about.  This is the world that we find ourselves in, even if we have a properly, optimally functioning human mind.  There are things that were once beyond our ken, which we understand now.  There are things that are currently beyond our ability to understand, which we may understand in the future.  There may be things we never understand.  But at the end of the day, these assertions about, oh, there's a God that created you and wants you to know and understand and love him, in the absence of supporting evidence for that and the inability to falsify it.  Getting back to Arthur C. Clarke's famous statement that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  And so when I have debates about the supernatural, it becomes, look, if I chop off your head and you are dead and we verify this and somebody puts your head back on and you get back up and walk away, I will agree that You were dead, and now you're not.  But I don't know what the cause of that is.  And I certainly don't have epistemic warrant to say that it was necessarily supernatural.  And all of that is true, even with the most optimally functioning brains.  Even with someone who's got optimal vision and hearing and whose brain is uncluttered with emotion or bias, just as close to a computer as you could get.  You can't get there from here without something being added to it, which is why many religions suggest that the thing being added to it is a revelation from God, direct communion, guidance from the Holy Spirit.  But they fail to see that that proposed guidance is still filtered through your brain.  A perfect God could try all day long to make you warranted in accepting a position and could never do it.  Maybe instead of questions about all powerful beings and can they make a burrito so hot that they couldn't eat it, maybe the question that we should be asking is, if there is a God, can he make himself detectable and believable?  beings that he created with flawed minds even when they're functioning optimally.  There's a limit to what we can know and understand and this is still within the realm of a properly functioning brain.  In the next video, or possibly two, we're going to take a look at how this issue is expanded to the point of demolishing the notion of a God when we begin looking at mental health issues and how religions have treated and dealt with the limitations of the mind, both when it's functioning properly and when it's not functioning properly.  See you next time. ",
