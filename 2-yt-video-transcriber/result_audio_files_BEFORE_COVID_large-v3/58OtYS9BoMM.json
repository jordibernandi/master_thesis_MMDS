            "text": "Hey!  Well, it's been nine months since I posted a video, so if you're watching this, thanks for not giving up on me.  Thanks for being interested when you were notified that I'm making a video.  So, if you watched maybe the last couple of videos, you'll probably not be surprised to hear that the main reason I haven't made videos for a while now is because my daughter was a senior in high school.  And then now she's starting college next month.  You know, it just was a lot.  It was a lot to... um, go through as a parent and to go through with her and to be supportive and try to be able to, uh, I guess just stay on top of everything that needs to be stayed on top of.  Um, maybe some of you have been on one side of that.  Some of you on the other, some of you have been through both of those as a parent and a child.  And, um, So good news, though, she did graduate totally fine, did really well.  Well, she like grades and stuff like that is important to to her.  And she knows that from her parents.  that she can go to school or college or not go to college or, you know, like trying not to hyper focus on the achievement part of things.  But she enjoys achieving and also knows that it should not be at the sacrifice of her health and wellness and her social life and things like that.  So I think she's found starting to find a good balance for all of that.  She's going to go to a school in Boston.  and is nervous and excited which i am also nervous and excited for her.  so uh but however she doesn't go for another month or so and i thought well i won't make videos until she gets out there but that's silly.  i think i just needed to sit down get this one video out real quick just to get myself back into the habit of talking to you and sharing things.  so this video is just going to be this me letting you know that.  um I've missed talking to you.  I've missed our connection and I want to be able to pick that up again.  So I'm going to do videos that aren't going to be highly edited because I want to be able to like record them and pretty much just post them the same day that I record them.  I still have a very full client schedule.  And so it's hard for me to sometimes fit in things like this, but it's going to be a big priority for me to do that.  And then once my daughter goes to school, I think I'm going to really work on having a new schedule so that I can be able to do this more often.  And then I think I still will put together videos that are edited, but it's kind of like Shane Dawson comes out with edited videos every few months.  Mine won't be as extensive or long as Shane Dawson's, but I think it's fun.  I think it's a great creative outlet.  Maybe I'll put together stories about my own upbringing and then me being a non-binary person.  elder and realizing that later in life and things like that, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  I'll talk about that later.  I just wanted to say hi.  I just wanted to make myself sit down before I start my client day to let you know that I missed you and I'm going to start posting videos again.  So until we talk again, which will be very soon, I promise.  Okay. ",
