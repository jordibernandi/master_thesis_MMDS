Is somebody being discriminated against?  And the third is, is religion being offered as the answer?  Like when I became an American atheist, I did not think that I would be in the gun business or weather business.  But when kids are getting shot and your solution is to offer thoughts and prayers and to put up in God we trust in schools, damn it, you just made that an atheist issue.  So now we want, and our stand song when it comes to guns is we want science and facts.  I'm not saying what it should be, but we want it to be evidence-based.  You know, if you're blaming hurricanes on the gays and abortion, Now I'm a weatherman.  Like, you're forcing me into these issues.  But that defines, and like I already said before, like on Planned Parenthood, women's reproductive rights, abortion, it's religion attacking that.
