I don't have any plans on going back.  I would love to talk to QEDcon.  I think they skipped this year.  But if you like that conference, reach out to them and say we want to have somebody talk about street epistemology there.  It doesn't even have to be me.  There are people in England who are more than capable of giving a talk.  Hi, how you doing?  Do you have time for a short interview?  My hobby, street epistemology.  Have you heard of it yet?  Epistemology is the study of knowledge.  Street epistemology is exploring through conversation the reasons why somebody thinks something is true, and how they validated that those are good reasons for thinking that it's true.  Okay.  So we pick a claim, like you think global warming is real, or you're sure there's a higher power, or maybe you think karma is real.  Ghosts?  Sure.  It could be something like that.  We take something that you not only think is real to a certain degree, you also act out on it because you think that it's real.  You might decide who to vote for, or you walk around your apartment with sage to scare away ghosts, something like that.  And I use questions to respectfully explore, yet challenge, how you could be so sure that it's real, that it's true.  Would you have any interest in doing a short... little interview.  I time it for four minutes.  No problem.  Yeah?  Okay.  Can I ask you to stand over there on that little piece of tape?  You don't mind?  Because I would like to record it with your permission if that's okay.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  All right.  My name's Anthony, by the way. ",
