            "text": "In the 17th century, the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz asks us to imagine two clocks or watches in perfect agreement as to the time.  This may occur in one of three ways.  The first consists in mutual influence.  The second is to appoint a skilful workman to correct them and synchronise them at all times.  The third is to construct these clocks with such an art and precision that one can be assured of their subsequent agreement.  How is it that we coordinate our activities as humans, like clocks?  Our language, our humour, our culture, our expectations, in many ways they come together so that we can interact.  For the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, born in 1930 and died in 2002, Leibniz was onto something.  Bourdieu's lifelong concern was how we interact sociologically, what glues society together.  He was particularly interested in how we're both free and constrained by the rules of society, how these two phenomena interact.  What is it that determines our tastes, for example, or our sense of humour?  And then where's the space for freedom in choosing our own tastes or sense of humour, our own path?  He wants us to think about how theory and the objective facts about society that affect us all, and practice how we live that theory and embody those objective facts in our own subjective ways, interact.  The result is an influential mix of sociology and philosophy that's had an impact across many disciplines.  His key concepts are habitus, field, and cultural capital.  And while it's important to understand how all three fit together, the key to understanding them all, and the focus here, will be the habitus.  The philosophical context of the second half of the 20th century is important for understanding Bourdieu.  Structuralists like Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss argued that there were universal, rigid rules to all societies that provided the foundation. ",
