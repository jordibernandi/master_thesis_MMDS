            "text": "In this case, the clich\u00e9 isn't the problem.  It's the premises behind it.  First of all, biology shows us that, regardless of the reproductive cycle of a species, there are plenty of animals that engage in homosexual sex.  And if we're talking purely scientific biology, remember that humans are an animal species.  Second, God wants us to be heterosexual, you say.  Well, let's ride right past where that argument requires you to prove that a God exists in the first place and ask this question.  What's the end goal here?  To make gay people go straight?  I know that people who aren't gay and who don't approve always focus on sex.  They're not even thinking about attraction, love, romance, relationships.  Nope!  It's all about bumping uglies in their mind.  Sex.  Genitals.  It's all they seem able to think about.  But we're just not attracted to the opposite sex, neither sexually or romantically.  Boys are great.  In fact, I think the vast majority of my best friends are male in one fashion or another.  But I'm not romantically or sexually attracted to any of them.  Now ask yourself, what if it went the other way and God suddenly declared that, since artificial insemination is though a viable alternative for reproduction, everybody needs to go gay?  Would you do it?  Would you, Alan, hold your nose and take it in the pooper because you're supposed to?  Indeed, it's a sin to not do so by divine command.  Would you kiss a man?  Marry a man?  Just on God's say-so?  And if not, why would you expect homosexuals to go straight?  And if so, well, you might have some other issues we need to discuss.  Point being that, if your goal here is to make gays straight, don't hold your damn breath. ",

It might even sound compassionate.  But let me just tell you, when people who identify as LGBT hear this, they think in their mind, well, let me ask a question, actually.  Do you know what's the only word they hear in this sentence?  Hate, exactly.  They hear, God hates me.  And guess what?  You hate them too.  Because in their mind, being gay is not just who they are, or not just what they do, it's who they are.  And so if God hates me, and you hate me too, then how is this a compassionate answer? ",

There were a lot of parts of my life where my decisions and my preferences and my behavior have not a damn thing to do with the targets of my romantic and amorous affections.  But because of the nature of religion and its expectations, many theists, Christian or otherwise, will let religion pervade every part of their lives.  Religion is designed to dominate a person's thinking, to infiltrate their entire life, and as a result, you'll often see theists assuming that things like homosexuality or atheism must do the same, that their entire world views the way religion is.  That said though, he's not wrong about how that statement about sinners is gonna be taken.  It's a pretty obnoxious thing to say.  You're not going to be insulting my entire worldview like he thinks, but I'll get grouchy regardless, much like I will if you try to tell me that, for example, Star Trek is better than the Orville, or that Roxette isn't the best band ever.

If you want them to believe that you love them or that God loves them despite what they're doing, here's what you should do.  Don't say something.  Rather, do something.  And that is... Love them, right?  You say God loves them.  Why don't you show up by how you treat them, right?  Spend time with them.  Go to the movies with them.  Next Avengers movie comes out, go see it with them.  Play tennis with them.  Whatever you do with your other friends, do it with them.  And because you're a Christian and you might be the only Bible they ever get to know, they'll interpret that as love from you.

Unless, of course, your opinions on pop culture differ from mine, then it's lock and load.  But no, Alan.  Being nice to people won't make them think it comes from your Christianity.  Being nice to people should be the default, Christian or otherwise.  And if you're only being nice to them because of your Christianity, what does that say about how you really think of them?  But then your Christianity is what's telling you?  they're abominations in the first place.  And I'm going to stop now, because this particular rabbit hole is gonna lead to contradictions and paradoxes like all religious logic.  Also, I think the plural of paradox should be paradoxin', cuz that just sounds cooler.  And while I love where this ended up, how you got there does leave something to be desired.  But maybe this is the first step, a foot in the door to true acceptance.  And even if it's not, hell, I'll take it.  On a more personal note, a sad thing I just heard while I was making this video just a few minutes ago is informed that Peter Mayhew, the man who played Chewbacca, has just died.  Star Wars has been a huge part of my life, a giant part of my childhood as an 80s kid.  And in many ways, it inspired me to animate, to learn any kind of filmmaking.  and so uh well this is a very sad bit of news.  and uh well may the force be with you peter.  no i don't believe in the force but as a star wars fan how could i not say it not to take a sheep shot?  sheep shot wow first shot and i blooper.  damn there are a lot of parts of my life where I don't know if that siren's being picked up.  Vote me down and I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. ",
