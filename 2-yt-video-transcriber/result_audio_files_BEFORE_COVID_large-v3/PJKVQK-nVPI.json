I thought all gamers were bigots.  This Apex Legends success completely smashes any notion that gamers are anything phobic.  Think about that.  10 million players in like 72 hours or something like that.  600, 700,000 concurrent players.  None of them care that the overwhelming majority of them are either going to be playing with a woman or a gay. ",

One, you assume that because the game is the most popular game, people don't care about gender or anything else.  It's possible that more players could have played, you don't know that, had there been more straight white male characters.  You don't know that, one.  Two, the fact that the sexuality and the gender or whatever of the characters is pushed very far into the background means that maybe these issues are important to some people and they are bigoted, but they don't care because it's not like a story game.  right.  three the fact that there is no story mode that actually like front loads these characteristics onto a character makes them part of the story part of the character a part of like whatever they get to any other person really hard means that their people could have been turned away for that reason as well right like there's like a million reasons where his his argument isn't really supported by any of the facts.  i mean this is like obvious obviously like it's almost not even worth saying but like holy shit there's like but he unironically believes it.  you know which yeah which he even literally admitted himself that like all of this stuff is found through like tweets and backstory and shit.  you don't actually see any of this in the gameplay.

Games' journalists.  Blue checkmarks who use the gaming community to write about social justice.  They are the only ones that really care about this.  Where are all the articles talking about how inclusive the gaming community is?  None, right?  Because that would smash their narrative that the gaming community is some sort of disgusting filth fest of unwelcoming people.  Let's not let Respawn and other development companies reap all these benefits because they are just playing the crowd.  If they knew, if they didn't know that all these trash articles about who these fictitious characters are hooking up with in a fictitious world outside of the game wouldn't happen, I'm not sure we'd see this here.  They are playing games journalists.  So either as a game journalist, you can continue to call gamers unaccepting.  Or you can write articles praising us for welcoming such a diverse cast of legends.

The whole premise of this video was that Respawn doesn't actually care about being inclusive.  They're just doing it to bait clicks.

I hope you enjoyed this video.  Have a great weekend playing some video games.  I'm gonna be jumping into Tom Clancy's Division 2, Pringles Totino's Pickle Edition, Beta, Private, SuperVPN, VIP, Bearing, Dankula Edition.  Right after this video, playing over the weekend so I can give you some initial thoughts.  Hope you enjoyed this video.  We'll talk to you again real soon. ",

I must be the only one who doesn't check the genders before I play.  Might I add, the white, fat, bearded male is also described with the word toxic.  Ooh, the real SJW agenda, agenda.  LGBTQ.  There are more than two genders.  Also LGBTQ.  We have bisexual in our name.  NAACP.  Calling someone colored is racist.  NAACP.  We have colored in our name.  This is just too woke for me. ",
