            "text": "Good morning.  I'm not having the best morning of my life.  It's already super late.  It's like quarter to twelve or later.  I slept in and I woke up and I have things that I'm meant to be doing today.  I'm meant to be creating assignment PDFs for the Story Magic Academy for this week's lesson.  I'm meant to be working on the script for next week's lesson.  so like I have this whole week scheduled out where like you know I need to finish these things so that I have time to shoot it and then I have time to edit it and I'm just tired and kind of burnt out and I've just woken up with like absolutely zero motivation to do anything.  I find myself getting like stuck in this kind of like limbo I guess, like this like paralysis where I'm like I'm so unmotivated that I don't know what to do with myself like i don't know how to like actually start doing things for the day.  um i meant to be going to like.  so i started this new like kickbox gym thing which i mean like and i was going to go today because i couldn't go yesterday but i woke up like maybe the start of like a head cold so like kind of sniffly and headachy and scratchy throat and i meant to go pick up some coffee that i ordered today which is like a bit of a walk and i'm kind of paying that off as well.  and it just feels like a lot to do today and i don't know how i'm gonna start to even get any of it done.  it's already so late i wasted so much time.  i need to shower I need to wash my hair.  I want to dye my hair again at some point.  It all just feels like a lot.  I think as well, like I always like get stuck in these little kind of like loops and like I feel like I've learned this lesson like a few times and I still like need to like keep reminding myself of it and keep learning it over and over again but like I need to stop trying to like make decisions and like plan out what I'm going to do for the rest of the day.  If I wake up feeling like shit in the morning, if I have a headache, if I'm in pain or something, I'm always like, what am I going to do?  I don't feel like doing anything.  And the real solution to that is to stop and do what you need to do to feel better.  So eat, take painkillers, have some water, have a cup of coffee.  and then like yeah work on feeling better and then once you feel a bit better then figure out what you're going to do with the rest of the day.  but I keep like trying to skip that part.  so I think what feels manageable to me right now is like getting up getting a shower.  still kind of dread the idea of washing my hair because I have to blow dry it and diffuse it and stuff and it's like a whole thing or whatever.  no it needs done like it needs to not feel gross.  So I'm going to do that.  And I think I'm going to tidy up the house a little bit.  Everything's a bit of a mess.  And I think that might make me feel better and make me feel a bit more centered and maybe ready to deal with some other stuff.  okay it is now jesus christ it is 20 past one kind of hungry now and there's not a lot of food in the house.  so i think that's going to kind of push me out of the house.  i also would like a smoothie because god I need to eat some fruit and veg because I have not been doing groceries and I've been cooking and I've been eating out all the time because work's been so busy and I feel like I might get scurvy soon.  so let's try and rectify that with some like orange juice or smoothie or something today.  let's give the living room a quick tidy up and then figure out where we're gonna go.  There is not lunch in the house so I'm gonna head out.  I don't know where.  Oh, Ross is in town today.  He's been working on music stuff so like part of me is tempted to just go and find out wherever he is and just go and sit and work there with him.  I also don't want to like derail his day.  I also just don't really want to go and work somewhere by myself all day either.  I don't think I'm picking up that coffee today.  So we're gonna leave that for another day.  Let me get my journal.  Okay, let's fucking... plan this.  Okay, I really need to get these assignments done.  I really do.  Okay.  That's... Tuesday.  My gym stuff, like my kickboxing stuff, is in town at the studio where I work.  So if I want to go then I can, like that stuff is there and I can just pick it up and go.  I can't really be asked or like.  I just don't know if I should... I should definitely eat first if I'm going to go at all.  I don't really know if I can be asked but I also know that I'm not in a great mood and it would probably help me feel better.  did go.  so okay we're gonna head into town because that's where all the stuff is and i will figure out where i'm gonna go on the way.  and if worse comes to worse or if i can't figure out i can i?  i can.  i know i can get food there and i can just go to the studio and work there.  um or i can see if ross is around.  Okay, well I made it.  I'm actually holding this against the wall and my hands are still shaking.  Oh my God.  Yeah, I did five rounds, which is my max so far has been six and I did five last time.  So I think that's pretty good.  I had a good time, but I think I'm definitely done now.  So it's time for a shower and to get changed.  So I've just had a little bit of like a bummer of a business email.  um as you do when you do what i do so that's dampened my mood somewhat which is why i maybe don't seem incredibly uh high energy right now.  um i did the work that i had to do today.  um i had some stuff that i would have liked to get done which i didn't but I finished the assignment stuff, the assignment PDF and everything for lesson six of the academy, week six.  But I think all in all, considering how the day started, which was not good, it actually turned out pretty good.  But yeah, like this morning I couldn't imagine doing anything and I did.  We ended up bumping into Ross's brother and his girlfriend, Lou.  And so we had some drinks in Brewdog and they were heading to a gig after.  So I decided to just come home because I was very tired and have a quiet kind of rest of my evening.  I'm going to change into my pyjamas.  It's going to be lovely.  I'm going to try and not think about business stuff.  I'm going to try and just chill.  And maybe I'll read.  I think I'll probably read in bed.  Thank you for joining me on my slightly difficult day and coming along with me.  I know this is something a bit new for my channel, like I've not really done any kind of vlog type stuff.  apart from during NaNoWriMo.  But I'm very interested in the kind of storytelling aspect of it.  Yeah, like picking out stories in my life to share with you in this format.  Seems like it might be fun and it might actually allow me to get videos up more frequently when I can't always be pumping out my normal type of videos, which is like, scripted and planned.  and let me know if you enjoyed this and if you would like to see more kind of vlog style videos from me and just kind of like dropping in for little stories from my life because how you guys react to this and stuff will definitely help me decide if it's something that I want to do more of.  and don't try and make decisions about what you're going to do with your day or your life when you feel like shit.  Feel better first, do things first, and then make decisions.  Okay, bye. ",
