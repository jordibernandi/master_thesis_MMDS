            "text": "Hi everybody.  Last year I made a video about how feminists screwed sex by teaching women that there was no obligation to consider their partner's sexual needs.  These days, if a wife doesn't feel like having sex, many women feel they're absolutely entitled to shut up shop.  And that's been a disaster for modern marriage.  Today I want to talk about the politics of bonking, which is another story of the damage feminists have inflicted on our love lives.  But this time it's happened by redefining the joys of bonking as masculine self-indulgence.  Men exercising patriarchal power by denying women clitoral sexual pleasure.  I want to start with a funny story.  It's a skit from a British comedian called Jenny LeCote, which is all about the fact that women aren't easy to please in bed.  It goes like this.  He, labouring away, pauses to ask, are you nearly there?  It's hard to say, says she.  He plunges on.  If you imagine it as a journey from here to China, where would you be?  She considers the kitchen.  To me, the point of that skit is that giving women sexual pleasure isn't always easy.  Lots of women are hard to arouse.  Plenty of women don't climax regularly, if at all.  Many have trouble coming during intercourse.  For men, it is different.  Of course, men have problems too with erections, with coming too quickly, with orgasms sometimes.  But as we all know, most men really enjoy bonking, shagging, screwing, the art of sexual intercourse, which has always been the most obvious way of making love for most of us throughout history, and partly due to its role in reproduction.  But what we never hear about anymore is there are plenty of women who are into traditional rumpy-pumpy and prefer to come that way.  Yet in modern times, these women are treated as peculiar, a rare, almost extinct species.  We're living through an era of what Germaine Greer called veritable clitoromania, where feminists for decades have been promoting the idea that the clitoris is the gold standard of women's sexual response and the vagina is dead in the water.  According to many feminists, women who climax easily during bonking are simply a figment of men's pornographic imagination.  Let's go back to where it all started.  It's certainly true that in past history the clitoris didn't receive the attention it's due.  A famous anatomy text called Gray's Anatomy erased the clitoris from the diagrams of the female genitals.  But then along came the famous American sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, who in 1953 declared that the clitoris was the root of all female sexual pleasure and the vagina a sexual dead end.  What's really quite extraordinary is that Kinsey reached these conclusions using a team of gynecologists who compared the sensitivity of the clitoris and the vagina using a cotton bud.  I think that's pretty funny, really.  As you imagine, it's not surprising that the very sensitive tip of the clitoris is more likely to respond to tickling with a cotton bud, a Q-tip if you like, than the vagina, which tends to respond to deep pressure, as I'll explain in a little while.  Next came Sherry Haidt, the author of a famous survey on female sexuality, which was called the Haidt Report, and over 3,000 self-selected women wrote about their sex lives.  Haidt, a feminist, declared that clitoral orgasm was the real orgasm.  Her survey found that only 30% of women climax regularly during intercourse.  But Haidt decided that those women had to be deluding themselves.  She wrote, the pattern of sexual relations predominant in our culture exploits and oppresses women, and claimed it was a myth that penile thrusting in the vagina could actually cause orgasm.  That was the start of a real attack on bonking as an act of patriarchal oppression.  For many feminists, intercourse has come to symbolise male brutality.  The worst example was anti-porn crusader Andrea Dworkin.  She once described herself as a feminist, but not the fun kind.  She wrote a book called Intercourse, which describes the sex act as a means of physiologically making a woman inferior, communicating to her cell by cell her own inferior status, impressing it on her, burning it into her by shoving it into her over and over, pushing and thrusting until she gives in and gives up.  Phew, she's definitely not the fun kind of feminist.  Well, this was an extreme view, but what was happening everywhere was sex therapists started promoting the idea that only small numbers of women come during bonking and that the clitoris is everything.  And then there were virtue signalling men like Ian Kerner, who wrote an incredibly detailed book on going down on women, She Comes First.  Here he is promoting the idea that bonking doesn't do it for women. ",

What I really object to are all these loud voices proclaiming the power of the clitoris and drowning out the views of those of us old-fashioned folk who still think bonking is best.  There have been a few brave voices speaking out about vaginal pleasures, like my friend Beverly Whipple from Rutgers University in New Jersey, who hit the news in the early 1970s writing about the G-spot, which is an area in the vagina of particular sensitivity, sometimes linked to female ejaculation in women.  Her discoveries about the G-spot led to a brief resurgence of interest in the vagina.  Whipple did some fascinating work.  She was a professor of nursing and she'd been hearing from women who had severe spinal cord injuries, who still told her they could reach orgasm.  How is this possible if their spinal cords were severed, cutting off the clitoral pathways to the brain?  So along with psychobiology professor Barry Komisaruk, Whipple traced brain activity during sexual stimulation and found another nervous pathway which provided sensory stimulation for orgasm.  While most genital nerves connect to the brain via the spinal cord, the stimulation of areas deep in the vagina, including the cervix, connect with the brain by a different pathway, namely the vagus nerve, which bypasses the spinal cord.  And it's this different connection which seems to allow many spinal cord injured women to enjoy sexual pleasure.  And for women who respond during thrusting, this may be part of their story.  Now, I've written about all this in my book, The Sex Diaries, and I'm going to put the relevant chapter on my website so you can read it.  Interest in the G-spot caused a brief resurgence in promoting the pleasures of the vagina, but soon the clitoral takeover was back in play. ",

            "text": "I can't help but wonder how much of this is driven, at least in part, by a desire to demonize the type of sex that many men particularly enjoy.  What made the whole business more complicated was important work by Melbourne urologist Helen O'Connell, who made great discoveries about the anatomy of the clitoris, showing the clitoris is not just a tiny button, near the vaginal opening, but a large, expanding, highly sensitive structure, which extends up to 13 centimeters and curves right around the urethra and vagina.  The entire clitoris contains spongy erectile tissue, similar to that in the clitoral glands.  That's a bit you can actually see.  The large clitoral structure is stimulated by vaginal thrusting.  So most therapists are now saying that there's no such thing as vaginal orgasm.  It's all due to stimulation of the large clitoral structure surrounding the vagina through both pressure on the clitoral glands and that bigger structure through the vaginal walls.  Now I think this research was really important, but it certainly doesn't explain why some women need that direct stimulation of the clitoral glands in order to climax. ",
