            "text": "In repentance we came and we said, you know what?  Forget my efforts.  Forget everything that I think I can do.  Forget honoring and glorifying myself.  I want to glorify God.  I want to receive his gift.  I want to humbly come to him and say, Lord, please cleanse me from all unrighteousness because of the death of your precious son on that cross.  And on the third day, he rose again.  And because he rose again, we will also rise again and be resurrected to live in his presence.  The apostles, 2,000 years ago, they laid down their lives because they knew this precious hope.  They died because they knew Christ was real.  They knew Jesus Christ was the living Saviour.  So please today, Lord, please take us into your presence and please lead us and guide us in what is your way for our lives in these last days.  May we give everything we have as a living sacrifice, which is our reasonable service.  And again, I know I fall short.  I know I fall short.  But I know that you are gracious and you love me.  Because of your love, because you love me first, that is why I love you.  Because you gave me that love, a love I could never know, a love I could never conjure up of myself.  But because you love me, that your love transforms me and you inspire me, you fill me with a desire to walk in your ways.  This is the transformed life.  This is the way that we overcome because Jesus overcame.  And because Jesus overcame, we can overcome through him, through his strength, not by our own efforts.  And this is the key that many of us miss.  that it's not by our own efforts, that we can't work towards this, that this is so far beyond what we could ever grab hold of.  The God of the universe, God almighty, knowing that he has all power in the universe and beyond, that he is the almighty creator, judge of the living and the dead, that he, the one who is above all things, He is offering to give me his spirit and to give me his strength that I may overcome the bondage, the trappings of sin in my life, that I may overcome these things and walk in his ways.  Jesus Christ, you are seated at the right hand of God the Father, and you ever live and intercede for me.  And because he lives, because he lives, I can face tomorrow.  And he will establish his kingdom on this earth.  And now, in this time, that we are all his hands and feet on this earth, that we are the body of Christ.  His kingdom is within us, those who are born again of his spirit.  And his kingdom is within us.  And let's manifest his ways.  Let's walk in his ways.  Let's show the world that he is a true loving father that does not desire for anyone to perish, but that all may receive his everlasting life.  And this is the greatest hope the world needs.  This is the light that the world needs in this time of intense darkness.  So folks, let's show the world out there that he is risen.  And because he lives, I can face tomorrow. ",

For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.  What shall we then say to these things?  If God be for us, who can be against us?  He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  But ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.  And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.  If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  Thank you. ",
