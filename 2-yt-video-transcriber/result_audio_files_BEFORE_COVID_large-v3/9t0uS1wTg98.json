Today we start my new series Stupid Humans.  that sees me take a look at the stupid outside of the flat earth.  This series will be out once every other weekend and my patrons will get to vote on what particular brand of stupidity the episode will contain.  I've decided to start off with a young Earth creationist called Eric Hovind, a strange son of nut bar evangelist Kent Hovind, and Patrons can vote right now on what next Fortnite's episode will be on.  I'm stepping outside of my normal realm right now, so I decided to ask for some help.  From a talking dinosaur.  Welcome to our first fortnightly look at some stupid humans.  We're living on a disk, floating through space, with a tiny sun.  Bye.  Right, what awaits me in this new land of stupid?  Let's find out. ",

Further, there are evaporites in this whole fossil, well, in between layers in the fossil record.  And you know what is interesting about evaporites?  They happen when water evaporates, leaving behind the non-volatile chemicals that were dissolved in the water, like salts.  Pray tell, how do we get layers of salt, in many cases very thick layers of salt, during a global flood when the water isn't drying out and then coming back to put more sediment, sometimes not even waterborne sediment?

The only similarity is the superficial one of both having paired shells that close on each other.  And brachiopods, when they die, have their shells close.  because their shells have to be actively held open, whereas bivalve shells have to be actively held closed by the animal.  As for these fossils being found on top of Mount Everest, yeah, Mount Everest is a result of the Indian plate colliding with the Asian plate and pushing up the seabed between them into the mountains.  This isn't some kind of a mystery.  Clams didn't end up there because they were washed up there by a flood.

But clams are also found all the way through to the top.  So why are there cenozoic clams, Eric?  Why are there clams in the same layers as things like birds and monkeys?  See, it doesn't actually make sense.  And then you look at things like why are ichthyosaurs only found in mesozoic strata rather than the higher cenozoic strata, where we can start to find things like serenians and cetaceans, which would presumably have about the same density.
