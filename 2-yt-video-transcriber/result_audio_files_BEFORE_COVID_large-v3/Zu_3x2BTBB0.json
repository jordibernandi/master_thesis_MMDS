So who is Jessica Yaniv?  Well, you're about to find out.  You might want to take a chill pill because you're gonna get worked up and angry in this video.  Jonathan Yaniv is a quote-unquote trans activist associated with the LGBTQ and the reality is that nobody really wants him involved.  now there's a reason for this and there's a reason.  something that's really important that i clarify in this video is that i don't care what identity you are.  i don't care what you identify as a he she them a he her an it whatever your pronoun whatever your identity.  that's not what this video is about.  This video is about somebody who is taking not only labels, but identities, and using that to prey upon vulnerable people in hopes of taking advantage of them and hurting them.  I don't care who you are, what you identify as, hurting people is not only not okay, but preying on vulnerable young people is even worse.  Jonathan Yaniv is a man.  Jonathan Yaniv pretends to be a woman.  This is not something that I like saying.  Jonathan Yaniv uses the trans label in order to prey upon young kiddos.  And no, I'm not joking.  But before we even dive into that, we have to focus on what started this whole trend and how even Jonathan Yaniv even started getting attention or traction.  It all started and stemmed from this individual filed 16 lawsuits on 16 different whores.  home-run spas.  This person's a sue-happy individual, but it's not for what you think.  You see, Jonathan Yaniv walked into a spa and thought it would be a great idea to demand that the women working at the spa and who own the spa lax their down below region.  The problem, though, is that Jonathan Yaniv was a man.  Making matters worse is that he is a man, claims to be intersex, claims to be mentally disabled and physically disabled, combined with also claiming that has a full-on menstrual cycle, which has been disproven, combined with the fact that these salons that he filed all these lawsuits against, the majority of them being women of color who own the salons.  And several of them, recent immigrants to Canada.  So you need to take these things into mind.  You know, I always remember hearing on the radio and the news about people making universal bathrooms where men and women can go in them, and all the arguments and the debates that would occur with claiming that people who are of a different identity or who identify differently or who are trans are going to prey upon other people of the opposite gender, specifically kiddos.  And while the majority of that is untrue, and holds no weight to being accurate, it only takes one bad cookie for a person to gain this much attention and for people to start to take notice that this person is not real.  Everything that they claim is fake.  If I, Daniel, walk into a female waxing salon and demand that they wax me as a male.  I just simply say, well, I identify as a woman, but you know, I still got everything down below.  I'm still a man, but I want you to do this because that's your job and you're a waxing salon who only does women, but I identify as a woman, therefore you have to do it.  That's not how it works.  This home run salon got so much national attention that it actually shut down.  One of them shut down.  thus affecting their home business.  What is wrong with you, Jonathan?  Why do you sue everything that doesn't go your way?  Why do you glorify the fact that young women should not have any rights to their own privacy?  Why do you say things like this, Jonathan?  I'm not even gonna read these things out to you, but they're absolutely disgusting, twisted, and it actually just gets worse and worse from here on to now.  This individual, Jonathan Yaniv, is in fact a predator.  A predator that made a goal to try to initiate a pool party for children with no supervision of parents because he wants to see them walk around without any clothes on.  No, I am not making this up.  Anytime a journalist or reporter goes up to Jonathan Yaniv, things like this occur. ",
