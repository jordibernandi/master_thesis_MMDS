            "text": "What's up my brothers from another mother got a crazy video for you today.  I did a little bit of a thought of experiments sort of a social experiment last week Just kind of test a theory that I had and I was expecting this result.  Although I wasn't expecting it to be this brutal.  we know as guys that we kind of live in an environment today where We're disposable and women are more of the protected sex.  I think that's kind of widely accepted.  So But what I didn't really see coming was the degree and the amount of, you know, hush up men.  We don't want to hear about it that I came across.  So I'll share all the factual stuff with you in just a moment.  But I think to kind of set the frame or the tone for this, a lot of guys that have used dating sites, for example, they've noticed that there's a long laundry list of requirements and demands that women have of men.  um i've talked about the six sixes before you know.  the six sixes are six foot tall six foot sorry six pack abs six figure income uh six inches in the pants six months out of a relationship and uh 600 horsepower car.  i don't think the 600 horsepower car is that relevant.  it's just the fact that it costs a lot of money to get a 600 horsepower car and that's what's relevant.  But that six sixes is kind of a basic list.  And I came across that a number of years ago at a dinner party and some women were trying to introduce me to their girlfriends and they're like, you know, all my girlfriends, they want the six sixes.  Okay.  So that's where I got that from.  But on a lot of dating sites, guys will see things like definitely got to be over six feet tall.  And that's pretty much a standard requirement.  The only thing that most people don't understand is like less than, it's somewhere between 15 to 20% of the North American population is actually over six foot tall.  I think less than 5% of the North American population is over six foot two.  So being over six foot tall is not that common, but it is a demand made of a lot of women.  Must be making at least six figures.  Have your own place, have your own car, not be a single dad, blah, blah, blah.  They got a long laundry list of things.  It's widely accepted and regarded today that it's okay.  Women are allowed to air the requirements of men.  However, when men do something similar, something entirely different happens.  There is a huge amount of outrage, which I'm about to show you.  So I shared it on a few different social media platforms, the two that I want to share with you in this video.  One was on Twitter.  And I'll put the link below.  If you're not following me on Twitter, it's just Rich underscore Cooper.  But I published this on the 14th of July.  It says, How to Keep a Man in Six Simple Steps.  And again, this was just a thought experiment.  I figured this was going to happen, but I did not expect this.  We got close to 9,000 comments, replies, mostly from angry, triggered, toxic feminists and white knights.  And this list of six is, in my estimation anyway, not that significant.  It's a conversation that parents would have had, you know, with their children over... long, long period of time anyway, I mean in recent history at least.  But today, this is deemed unacceptable.  It's deemed hate speech.  So number one, learn how to cook amazing dishes because God forbid that you learn how to apply heat to food to make it healthy and tasty and good for you.  Number two, be feminine like have long hair, do your makeup, have nice nails, basic stuff like that, not cut it short and dye it purple obviously.  Number three, don't nag him over trivial things.  You think that this would be not a big deal, you know, just to be a nice person and be kind of kind and not make mountains out of molehills sort of thing.  But that, you know, I stuck it in there.  Be debt free, which is just essentially be good with money.  You know, don't show up with loads of student loan debt and credit card debt and expect your problems to become my problems.  It's a pretty simple concept.  You want to keep a guy around, be good with money.  Number five, don't be a single mom.  I've talked before about single motherhood and why I think guys should avoid that.  I'll put a card up on the top right for a couple of videos you might want to check out for reference so I don't beat that horse to death.  And number six, know how to please them in bed because at the end of the day, I've talked about this before, men are success objects to women and women are beauty objects to men.  Card up on the top right, check that out.  All right, so that's Twitter.  Now let's take a look at a couple of the responses if I click open to this.  Because this is where it gets really interesting.  So this one over here, this guy Beachbum, who's a white knight, says, so dude, I'm assuming you have been in your parents' basement for a few years.  We got Mistress Alexa, get me to FetCon, whatever that means.  And she's got a OnlyFans link, which is basically a cash donation for premier access.  to what exactly here?  This is her.  yeah okay uh obviously she doesn't qualify for my list but she says how to keep a woman in six simple sets.  don't be this guy right here.  right and it goes on and on and on like literally there's 9 000 of them.  they just continue to go on and some of them are quite harsh.  i'm not even going to um dive into the harsh ones just because if i were to show you the the screen um my video would get shut down even my channel probably.  but like this is supposed to be people that are tolerant of the opinions of others.  or you know they claim to be more tolerant for some reason but they don't seem to be.  when it comes to a simple list of six things.  now i went even further on instagram because i wanted to see what would happen if i reposted the same thing there.  i added number seven.  don't get fat.  i think that's pretty common lodge like at least take care of yourself like when you meet somebody continue to look that way five six ten years down the road.  right you don't want to Pull the pin on the fat grenade, as Terrence Popp would say.  But there you have it.  Anyway, so here's some of the responses.  There was several, close to 2,000 likes on this, I think.  There it is.  1,888, interesting number.  Anyway, but like this example over here, apologize for this terrible post because I am personally offended along with many other women.  There was 236 back and forth on this.  It was just incredible.  And there was a lot of this sort of stuff that popped up.  So this is, gentlemen, par for the course.  We live in an environment today where women are allowed to air their requirements and demands of men, but conversely, you're not allowed to have any expectations whatsoever.  In fact, if you do air anything that would be a common conversation between a mother and a daughter 50 years ago, today it's deemed unacceptable.  It's deemed hate speech.  It actually offends people to the point where They want you to apologize for this terrible post because they are personally offended along with many other women.  Let's just take a quick peek at this profile.  And we don't have a picture anywhere, of course, because there's probably, in my estimation, nothing really to look at.  But that's what you get.  I mean, I always say, like, I'm the do the work guy, right?  Okay.  T-shirts, by the way, in the T-Springs store if you want to pick up some merch and support the channel.  But I'm the do the work guy, right?  I've gone to the gym.  I've picked up the weights.  I've looked after myself.  I've made bank.  I've made sure that I'm strong, competent, virtuous, and I got all my stuff together.  You ask the same of women or even something close to the same, and it's like apply some heat to food.  you're a misogynist and they kind of lose their mind.  There was another example over here I wanted to show you.  I don't know if you guys remember, but Aquaman star Jason Momoa was shamed on social media recently for his dad bod.  If you don't know who Jason Momoa is, he was the guy that played Aquaman.  He was also in Game of Thrones as Karl Drogo.  He's pretty fit.  I think he's just a little bit younger than me.  If I remember, he's about 39, 40, but he's in really good shape.  And here's a picture of his dad bod that women shamed him for.  So apparently this is not acceptable for these ladies.  And if we take a look at these ladies over here in their comments, Nadine says somebody needs to start lifting again.  Alana says been working on his dad belly.  With a picture of a dog.  By the way, guys, I'm just going to say this.  Whenever ladies, you know, guys at this already know this, in fact.  But if you have a picture of your pet as your profile picture on Facebook, there's a reason for it.  We know that there's nothing for us to look at.  So you kind of hide behind this.  So for you to make comments like this is utterly ridiculous.  Rhonda says, my goodness, that's all I can say.  Sheesh.  And Jay Loney here says, OMG, his stomach.  And Jay Loney, I suspect your stomach would be no better.  Anyway, so that's how Jason Momoa was shamed publicly by these women for his... And I'm going to do the quote-unquote because you have the quote-unquote dad bod.  Dude is pretty fit still, even in that picture.  I want to show you one more thing before I kind of move on and start to wrap up this video.  Now... This tweet over here got picked up by media.  You know, obviously, there's a lot of engagement.  So it got picked up by media.  And there's a couple of pieces put out.  And here's one from this guy is John Sundholm.  This is what John looks like.  He claims to be gay on his Twitter profile, from what I understand.  His claim to fame is he made Ellen DeGeneres laugh once.  Anyway, so this is John.  So the way that he took the tweet was he completely twisted it and put it out as a guy's list for tips on how women can keep a man is getting dragged all the way back to the 50s.  He goes on to call me.  Oh, he posts a picture.  It's funny.  This is the picture that he pulls off.  This is me, obviously.  Pulled it out of the Twitter feed.  And we all know what John looks like.  So he's now pointing and sputtering at me saying he's a real fine scraggly beard at all.  And then he just like these so-called tolerant people start saying things like, seriously, beard oil and a set of clippers will run you 20 bucks on Amazon.  It's not hard, comma, dick.  So that is the tolerant left having a go at me because I put a list out of six or seven things that I think women should consider if they want to keep a guy around.  I don't think it's too difficult.  I don't think it's a whole lot to ask.  But I think that what this social experiment does, this thought experiment, if you will, it just accurately demonstrates that we live in an environment today where women can hold or expect certain standards of men and even try to hold men to them.  You saw the body shaming or the fat shaming that they were doing for Jason Momoa and his so-called belly.  And we just can't ask the same back or you can't publicly do it.  So, you know, there's a lot of people out there, you know, women specifically wondering why they can't find a good man.  And it's like, well, you know what, maybe if you actually considered that, There's a lot of great guys out there and you might want to open your scope of reasoning and understanding to the facts anyway and just take a good close, good hard look in the mirror.  I always say to guys, always consider the source when somebody spits hate at you.  Again, this is me and this is my friend John and this is how I go about life is I always consider the source when somebody points and sputters at me.  so gentlemen that's a little bit of a lesson.  classroom is pretty much out of session right now.  this is what i do.  this is bomber command and i'm dropping your cold hard truth bombs.  if there's somebody that needs to see this video hey share it with them on social media.  put it out somewhere.  in fact somebody made an interesting comment back over here on this instagram post if i remember.  and what did they say here?  Bro, you on the Joe Rogan podcast would be the ultimate gift from God.  Do it.  I love Joe Rogan.  So anyway, if you think that I should be doing something like that, put that out there.  Also, again, Teespring merch is in the store below.  Linked, pinned below on your laptop and tablet and all that good stuff.  Smash the like button and take me to task.  You disagree with me, leave a comment below.  I want to hear you point sputter at me.  Come at me with what you hate about me.  Come on, tell me more about my scraggly beard.  Does it need some beard oil?  Does it need trim?  Anyway, see you guys in the next video.  Peace. ",
