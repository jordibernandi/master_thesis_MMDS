We're going to talk about what that might mean for the election here with The Roundtable for some analysis from Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.  Like Corbyn, Bernie Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist, and he's been a steady number two behind Joe Biden in national polls after that sustained run against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  So we asked Nate to take a look at Sanders' chances of winning the nomination in 2020. ",

            "text": "So the Democratic primary hasn't been that chaotic, but there certainly have been a few meaningful shifts in the race.  There was Kamala Harris's quick rise and long fall.  Pete Buttigieg has surged recently in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Elizabeth Warren spent months climbing in the polls, only to lose momentum in the last few weeks.  All the while, Bernie Sanders has been chugging along at between 15 and 20% in national polls.  His support has barely budged, second only to Joe Biden.  It's therefore easy to forget about Bernie, and he's gotten less coverage in the media than the other frontrunners, but he's still in a pretty decent position.  he's within striking distance of winning both Iowa and New Hampshire.  According to the 538 polling average, Buttigieg currently leads in Iowa by about one point, but it's basically a three-way tie between him, Biden, and Sanders.  The same is true, more or less, in New Hampshire.  Sanders is also polling relatively strongly in the third state to vote, Nevada, and his support has edged up in delegate-rich California, which votes on Super Tuesday.  Here's why that matters.  Sanders is close enough to Biden nationally that bounces from the early states, especially in Iowa, could make the rest of the race extremely competitive.  Of course, being in striking distance in Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada is not the same thing as actually winning those states.  And if he does manage to win an early state or two and close the gap on Biden, you would expect the Democratic Party elites might make some moves to stop Sanders.  So do I buy that Bernie has a shot at the nomination?  Definitely, I do.  Look, If you had to pick one candidate in this race, it would probably be Biden.  His position is fairly robust.  But Bernie has as strong a hand to play as anybody else. ",
