            "text": "Suffering of the Jews in Nazi Germany, that same Pope turned his back on the suffering of black people in America.  You know it's right.  300 years you are not allowed to read, you are not allowed to grow in intelligence, Their religious understanding made it easy for them to do you like they do.  How?  How?  How did religion fortify this?  When they said that black is evil.  When you look in the scripture, whenever it talks about truth, it talks about light.  Whenever it talks about sin, it talks about darkness.  Is that right?  So there's a subliminal message if divine understanding isn't given that your blackness is something of a divine curse.  And they have even preached that you are black because you are the children of Ham.  Is that right?  Come on now.  So when you look in the mirror and see a black face, what do you think?  How can you love your neighbor if you don't love yourself?  How can you find any solidarity and you're displeased with the way God has created you?  You don't like your hair.  You don't like your nose.  You don't like your lips.  You don't like your color.  You don't like your origin in the world, but you love the Lord.  Something is wrong somewhere.  We are so filled with self-hatred, brothers and sisters, that we are the number one murderers and killers and rapers and robbers of one another.  Will you agree?  Yes, it's bad to see a white police shoot a black child down, but it's worse to see you, the brother, the father, the one that is by nature the very essence of that brother that you are killing, shooting, killing, cutting, raping, robbing, cheating one another.  Yet you go to church and you are taught day after day to love white folks.  I challenge you, Reverend, get up in your pulpit and begin to teach black people to love themselves and you'll make a people overnight.  let's look at it brother.  now.  sisters and brothers don't you know?  when you look at your blackness as something of a divine curse you're always trying to get away from yourself so it's easy for you to then be assimilated into a culture that really does not want you, nor love you, nor care about you.  So you're always a false, phony people trying to appease white folks.  So you talk a little differently.  You hold your cigarette like they would be pleased.  You, you, you black professors that feel it's such a great blessing to be a member of the faculty.  You do everything in your power to appease white folks so that they will give you tenure, so that you will hold on to your little job, so you could drive your nice car and live in your nice home.  Is that all life means to you?  To sell your soul for money?  To keep up a front while you know deep down inside you are an empty nigger?  Listen to me good.  You know what I'm talking about.  When you lay down at night with your doctorate degree and haven't done a damn thing with it.  That's emptiness, brother.  When you can't produce nothing for your knowledge, you're empty inside.  So the only thing you must do is masquerade.  Yes, I'm doctor so and so.  I worked for years to get my degree.  You big phony.  We need to just stick a pin in you and bring you to reality.  A doctorate degree ain't where it's at.  God don't have no doctorate degree.  God is the doctor.  How do you know?  How do you know that God is the greatest?  He says, don't look at my degree.  Check out my handiwork. ",
