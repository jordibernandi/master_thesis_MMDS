            "text": "Good morning.  Welcome back to Blue Ridge Silverhound.  I am your host today, Sean, your coin connoisseur.  And we are going to talk about a really cool time in history.  Well, cool for us, maybe not for those folks back then that were trying to get used to this transition in their coins from 64 to 65.  We saw the loss of the silver 90% composition coins and then the transition into some brave new world in which we call the copper nickel clad coin era.  So we're going to go ahead and take a look at some of the most valuable coins to come out of the first year of the all copper nickel clad era.  Okay, except for the Lincoln scent, which is still a bronze copper scent.  But before we get started, as always, if you haven't done so already, feel free to subscribe.  Hit the bell for instant notifications.  I'm going to be doing giveaways all summer long.  So we're going to be doing gift cards, silver, coins.  We already had a few very successful and very fun giveaways to kick off this amazing educational summer program that I have going for you.  So without further ado, we're gonna go ahead and jump right into the topic at hand.  Again, we're gonna talk about 1965 coins that sell for a tremendous amount of money, okay?  I'm gonna tell you what the buy-in is, what's involved, where can you find some of these coins, what's involved, and we're gonna talk about some of the resources that you could leverage and utilize.  so that way, if you wanted to jump in, okay and buy sell grade these coins you could do that with a little bit more confidence because you know exactly what's going on.  so we're gonna start in uh ascending order with the lowest denomination.  of course you know that would be the penny we're going to talk about.  you know a little bit about the coin the mintage and everything of that nature.  so the coin that you see on screen before you is the 1965 lincoln cent.  all right uh again The Lincoln Memorial backed coin design has been around for a while since 59 all the way up to 2008.  So it's a design that we're all used to seeing.  But typically this particular date right here has been remained unloved.  For many years because again it was mired at a point where silver was exiting the standard program of US Mint coinage and transitioning over to the less favorable copper nickel clad.  People saw these coins as being worth less even though they had a face value to them.  So the Lincoln cent that you see here, a ton of them were made.  1,497,224,900 coins were produced at the time.  That is a bunch.  Here's the caveat.  Very little of these coins were ever preserved in the bright red, newly minted state.  So finding some that are in pretty good shape is few and far between.  i could say this though the highest grade uh ever taken care of by any of the third party graders is mint state 67 plus full red in which one exists at that grade.  now seeing as how that particular example has never hit the open market uh so we don't really have a price to go off of other than the pcgs price guide value in which in this case it's four thousand dollars.  So that's the Lincoln cent there for you.  Alright, so I'm going to skip the nickel for a very specific and very special reason because that coin is special in its own right.  We're going to save that to the end.  Well, let's go ahead and jump into the Roosevelt dime.  Okay, this particular coin right here, again, just like the Lincoln cent, a bunch of these were made.  At the same token, there is a low survival rate in those high mint state grades because people just didn't care enough about saving this coin because of the transition from silver to copper nickel clad.  So $1,652,000,000.  140,570 Roosevelt dimes were produced for 1965.  And this is not including the special mint set coins which were available in those special mint sets at the time.  Okay, so those aren't in the equation.  The highest grade is by PCGS at a mint state 68 with full bands or full torch.  On the reverse of these coins you're going to have a highly identifiable split on not only the top set of bands but the bottom set of bands on the torch.  So it has to be a nice clean line that goes all the way across.  grade wise there are only three that have graded 68 full torch all right.  and the uh.  the highest recorded uh sale of this particular coin was back in march 2013 by heritage auctions in the amount of 3819 dollars.  And yeah, again, another tough date.  Typically we don't see clad coins, especially in the Roosevelt dime, command the kind of premiums that they do for those examples that hit those highest grades.  So as far as a penny and a dime, your best bet is try and find a cache of these in which they are preserved in mint state.  There are BU rolls to be had out there that you could pay a premium for and just kind of cherry pick some of those higher grade examples.  It's tough, it's difficult.  uh mostly in part because the u.s mint didn't quite put enough care in the overall maintenance of the dyes and just overall quality qc process of these coins of the 1960s left a lot to be desired all right.  so that's why it's such a challenging outlet of coins to search through is because of the sheer quality control issues And just, you know, again, that transition from silver to clad, less people were bought into this type of coins.  So they just spent it.  So let's go ahead and take a look at the quarter.  And in the case of the quarter, still quite a few of them were produced.  It was the year of mass production.  1,819,717,540 pieces were produced of the 1965 quarter.  If you're able to find the highest grade, keep in mind the top grade Issued by any third-party grader is Mint State 67+, in which eight examples exist at that grade level.  Now this coin right here is actually kind of the lowest priced coin between this and the candy half dollar.  The highest recorded sale of the 65 quarter was on Heritage Auctions back January 2017 in the amount of $2,585.  all right so um and it drops off considerably if it doesn't hit that 67 plus grade.  so if it was 67 you're talking about a coin that dips all the way down to about 100 150. uh so again with some of the other coins You have a huge sharp decline from the top pop to the next grade level down.  Even if it is just half a point, you got to keep in mind that there is an element of kind of risk, a little bit of gambling when you're going to submit these.  So training your eyes to kind of... identify those coins that have the cleanest surfaces is paramount in the success of flipping grading.  and you know just turning these coins over for any measurable amount of profit it's been done before.  there are people and collectors that do it for a living.  it is extremely difficult but it's you know it's.  it could be fruitful all right.  So let's go ahead and switch over to the half dollar, the Kennedy half dollar in this case.  In contrast to the other coins, the mintage of the 65 half dollar is considerably less.  Now keep in mind that they integrated a 40% silver composition planchet on all of these coins.  So you still have a little bit of value in terms of its intrinsic value.  Now, as far as the mintage, the US Mint produced 65,879,366.  So, you know, it's considerably less, but there's still quite a bit out there to fulfill the demand of collectors.  The highest grade assigned of this coin is Mint State 67 Star through NGC.  In PCGS, 67 is the top grade and there are 25 that have graded at that level.  In terms of a most recent sale, that NGC 67 Star sold back 10%.  may 8 2016 so it's been a few years on great collections in the amount of 2477.20. um i feel like we haven't quite seen the ceiling on this coin.  uh the first mint state 68 example that does get graded and then subsequently moved on the secondary market could break all sorts of records.  So what I wanted to do and the reason why I left the Jefferson nickel last on the list is that this coin is prohibitively rare in grades with full split bands or full split bands with full steps.  If you turn the coin around and you looked at Monticello, you're going to need some of those sharply struck steps on the reverse.  There are six lines that go across on those steps and you need at least five, five and a half full steps on the coin in order for it to grade out at that full steps designation.  Now with the nickel, this one seems like it's lesser mintage, especially for a regular general circulating coin like the penny, the dime, and the quarter.  At 136,131,380 pieces were produced, it seems like it's smaller.  Again, the survival rate of this particular coin is very low in mint state grade, so keep that in mind.  So the top grade with full steps is mint state 66 through PCGS in which only one example with full steps exists in both a 65 and 66.  There are only two examples of this coin at that grade level.  So here's the interesting part and this is the big reason why I left this coin for last.  There is one example, and the one example is that Top Grade 66 with Full Steps.  It is actually available on Collector's Corner, which is a marketplace that's administrated by PCGS, for an amount of $445,800.  It's still for sale, which means that undoubtedly this is not the sale price, but I wanted to draw your attention to the potential value of such a coin as long as only one exists.  Now if more come out to the market, which it seems like it's very difficult considering there are only two coins with full steps, this could be a huge, huge payday for someone tenacious enough to look at a ton of 1965 min state quarters.  Again, if you're able to find some BU rolls or perhaps a mint bag, keep in mind, people are going to be selling these for an incredible premium.  So it is not for the faint of heart, but as you can tell, the rewards can be absolutely astronomical in this case.  So before I leave you here today, all right, first of all, I want to thank everyone for joining in on this fantastic broadcast.  In 1965, of course the U.S.  made some errors.  I have a few of them, a couple very, very noticeable and very well-known errors.  All right, so the first one that we're going to start out with here is a 1965 Lincoln cent that was inadvertently struck on a dime planchet, okay?  And this is going to be a copper-nickel clad dime planchet.  So obviously it's not copper in appearance.  This one was struck on a little bit smaller sized planchet in the dime.  And this one right here sold on great collections as a matter of fact.  March 8th, 2015 in the amount of $377.30.  And by the way, this is a PCGS Mint State 64 example.  Alright, so the next coin right here, another phenomenal error, is going to be a 1965 Roosevelt dime that was struck on an older 90% planchet, 90% silver planchet.  These tend to come and go in the marketplace and people do come across them in coin roll hunting.  Believe it or not, this is a case where one example was pulled out of change some time ago.  This one was graded PCGS AU55, okay, about uncirculated, which indicates that this coin has seen quite a bit of handling in its day.  This one sold on Great Collections May 10th of 2015 in the amount of $5,115.  Woo!  That is amazing.  I need to find me one of those, if not two or three.  And finally, we're going to end it off on the same variant, only in a quarter form, okay?  A 1965 Washington quarter that was struck inadvertently on maybe a leftover 90% silver planchet.  Again, these were intended to be copper nickel clad.  This one graded PCGS AU55, and this one sold on Great Collections, back february 18th of 2018 in the amount of a cool seven seven thousand eight hundred seventy five dollars.  bam there you go tons of value to be had again.  1965 coins are not for the faint of heart but it produces whole wealth of various types of our opportunity to go in kind of like hone your craft in coins and being able to identify grade all right.  it produces a lot of challenge to beginning and seasoned numismatists alike.  so I would encourage you go ahead and check out 1965 US coins again.  I'm your host Sean with Blue Ridge Silverhound.  I want to thank everyone for all the views and support.  Share, subscribe, giveaways all summer long.  You're going to love it.
