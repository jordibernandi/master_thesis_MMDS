            "text": "All right, so we're going to talk about this documentary, Leaving Neverland.  Michael Jackson, of course, back.  All in the news.  Hey, the economic factors have taken the spring of the Easter Bunny.  You see it everywhere.  All your Disney media is going haywire with this stuff.  Ah, I wonder why, right?  It's very interesting.  So this film is just this documentary.  It's just come out.  I'll read the little excerpt here.  At the height of his stardom, Michael Jackson began long-running relationships with two boys aged 7 and 10 and their families.  Now in their 30s, they tell their story and how they came to terms with it years later.  Hard to watch, tougher to ignore, impossible to forget.  Rolling Stone.  Do you read Rolling Stone?  You need to be bitch slapped to hell and back.  You are a stupid motherfucker if you read Rolling Stone, or at least if you read it and you don't rip it to shreds.  It's your Disney media.  It's your mind control.  That's all it is.  It's your Disney media.  All your media, they control it.  So whatever they're programming you with, that's what's going on.  And what we have with Michael Jackson is the classic case of massive sort of demoralization where they build up this mega celebrity and all these people idolize this person.  I mean, if you were around, like if you're old enough to remember the 80s and the 90s when Michael Jackson was like the biggest star in the world.  He was like Elvis 2.0 sort of thing.  He was the biggest star ever.  And it didn't matter what Michael Jackson did, it made the news sort of thing.  That's the way it was.  And in many ways, Michael Jackson himself is a prefabricated sort of product from day one almost from when he was in the Jackson 5.  And this is what they want to do in many ways is to constantly take your idols and destroy them.  So they build them up to a mythical status, a godlike status, and then they chop them down.  And this is a massive psychosis sort of demoralization sort of agenda that they do.  And to come in here and to pick a side, because, you know, that's what they want you to do.  The left, right, black and white, right?  Base consciousness, stupid fucking retard, sheeple paradigm that they program everyone in.  They want you either to be a pro-Michael Jackson or an anti-Michael Jackson.  They don't want you to go anywhere else.  What I'm saying is this is a perfect example why you should reject all your entertainment.  It doesn't necessarily mean you can't enjoy a good song.  All right?  I can enjoy a Michael Jackson song.  It'd be like a guilty pleasure.  It's not something I would, you know, play in my home or anything.  Well, maybe... If other people are around sort of thing, but I can dig some of the pop that he did in the early days off the wall and stuff like that, right?  There's some cool songs, some good producing.  You know, I think it was Quincy Jones.  But, you know, at the end of the day, Michael Jackson was just a pop star.  And pop music is pretty shallow shit to begin with.  So why do people idolize him?  Well, in terms of musical sort of talent, Michael Jackson might have been a mediocre sort of, I mean, he didn't really play any instruments and he could sing fairly well.  It was more his performance, his aura, right?  They could stick him up on stage and he was a natural sort of performer.  He danced really well.  He was really good at choreographing.  But the whole machine around Michael Jackson turned him into this superstardom thing, right?  So if you think back to one of his biggest blockbuster videos, it was Thriller, if I'm not mistaken, which was, I don't even know if it's the greatest selling album of all time.  And that's meaningless anyways, right?  Other than you want to put it in a pop context.  But Thriller was something that was a video that they spent millions of dollars on.  So it totally changed the production level of music videos.  And then there were commercials that were tied in and everything else.  So Michael Jackson is every bit a part of the New World Order and this beast sort of system, this New World Order that they're bringing in, as anyone else, basically.  So in many ways, whatever nasty things he might have been up to is irrelevant, right?  It should be totally irrelevant to you because you should reject it all.  Again, it doesn't mean you don't have to, you know, never listen to a Michael Jackson song again.  But why would you invest any of your emotions into this?  Don't you realize that it's all manipulations?  It's all a fabrication to begin with?  that these documentaries could very well be mockumentaries?  you don't know the fact from the fiction.  you just know the story that they present and then they can endlessly play people against each other.  so look at some of these headlines here.  oprah winfrey aired a powerful interview.  oprah winfrey is a hideous lying sociopathic psychopathic cunt from hell.  you can please tell her if you meet her tell her.  jeff c says that because i don't think there's anybody that i hate more in media history than Oprah Winfrey.  But of course, she has risen her fat, ugly fucking ass up out of the pits of hell to, you know, push this psyop forward.  Leaving Neverland, Corey Feldman, Jermaine Jackson, React.  There's Corey Feldman, not sure the tribe.  Of course, once again, coming forth.  Partake and get his name in the media because this guy's such a disgusting, narcissistic puke from hell.  And he's so desperate for money and attention.  Leaving Neverland sparks a re-examination, of course.  Leaving Neverland, what happened to part two?  The doc cast a shadow on Jackson's legacy.  And it's the CBC Disney News, the E!  Disney Online, CNN Disney, U.S.  Disney Today, New York Disney Times.  It's all Disney media.  It's all the same.  It doesn't matter if they're presenting the left or the right or the pro or the con.  It's the same thing.  They just want to take your energy.  This is what it is.  They take your energy.  So somebody like Michael Jackson can be used till the end of time.  As long as they keep him relevant, as long as they keep putting shit out on Michael Jackson, they keep re-releasing things or finding old unreleased singles and stuff and constantly keeping him in the rotation, they could use him endlessly.  Just like they still use Elvis to this day.  And people still, you know, there's still people that obsess over Elvis for God knows what reason.  I mean, well, idiocy, you know, just programming.  People invest in their celebrities.  This is nothing new, though.  I mean, the royals figured this out probably centuries ago, how to occupy the masses.  I mean, this probably goes back thousands of years, you know, presenting idols and using the idols to program the masses.  And then... Eventually, maybe the idols you want to use in a different matter.  Maybe you want to take away the energy because maybe the idols now can be used in a different form.  So Michael Jackson might be used for good and say, well, look at Michael Jackson.  Neverland, he loves children.  His whole mission is to save children.  Isn't this amazing?  It's a wonderful Michael Jackson, Pepsi, hair catches on fire, Michael Jackson, this, Michael Jackson, that.  He's everywhere.  He's all over the media.  Then all of a sudden, you know what?  Let's take that picture of Michael Jackson and let's just turn it upside down.  They love that as above, so below.  They love just flipping things upside down.  They love to build up celebrities and then rip the rug out from underneath them like they did with Elvis, Britney Spears, and so many others.  This is more and more the reason why you have to reject all your entertainment.  Reject it all.  It doesn't mean you can't.  know occasionally enjoy say a michael jackson song or occasionally watch a movie.  it just means don't evoke don't invest yourself emotionally in any of their shenanigans don't be dragged into it don't allow your sentiments to be played because none of it's really real.  none of it's real It's not.  It's what they want you to be programmed with.  It's what they want to take your energy.  They want to take your energy.  So in many ways, this is just a massive sort of demoralization thing for people that have built up Michael Jackson as this... You know, this godlike figure.  And now they can come and say, oh, you're all a bunch of fucks now because, you know, he was a disgusting pedophile.  And this is, you know, and look at this.  Does leaving Neverland spell trouble for Michael Jackson's estate?  Like, I mean, like, why would you care?  Why would you care anything about his estate?  Why would you care about his family?  Why would you care about anything with this shit?  So Leaving Neverland reviews, here's what people are saying, and it just goes on.  Leaving Neverland may spell trouble for Michael Jackson's estate.  See, I mean, it's copy-paste.  It's the Disney media.  It's over and over again.  Now, some of these characters that are coming forth, this is one of the kids here.  When you hear the stories as they're delivered, and this is where they get you, right?  Because the stories are so ridiculous.  They're almost designed to have the endless divide.  Because there's the, you know, Michael Jackson's a horrible pedo and that's it sort of side.  And then there's the, well, wait a second.  Why did Michael Jackson have... You know, these families staying months on end at Neverland and the parents would allow Michael Jackson to sleep in the same bed as their child.  Or they allow their children to sleep with Michael Jackson, basically.  And how could they not fucking know?  Well, right, that's what they want.  They want to take your energy.  They want to occupy you.  Like so much of what the New World Order does is just sapping your energy.  So much of it is.  So much of it is just taking your, diverting your strength, diverting your consciousness and sending it somewhere nasty.  That's so much of what they do.  They do this on a daily basis.  You're constantly inundated with these types of stories.  That there is no resolve to them.  There never will be a resolve.  They're not meant to be resolved.  They're meant to be just there to take your fucking energy and demoralize you and take you off, take you down a road and just occupy your time completely and distract you from anything that they're actually up to so that you invest your time so that you... You know, I was thinking about this the other night.  Because I was, you know, I tell folks I'm a fan of hockey.  So I do read some hockey blogs because I'm a fan.  And I think about when I look, I never ever write in any forums or anything like that.  But I do peruse them.  And I notice like one of the things I notice is it's just.  people's energy is completely diverted all the time.  Like people put so much energy into discussing and debating things that are completely meaningless, that have no relevance to anything whatsoever.  So instead of improving your life and focusing on what you need to do to make yourself a better person and striving forward in that direction continually, you're diverted.  And your energy, which could be placed somewhere else, is now in some forum debating whether or not Michael Jackson is a pervert.  Whether or not he was a pedo or whether or not the parents are more to blame than Michael or whether Michael Jackson was just a total victim from day one.  Oh, he was a child star.  He was abused by his parents.  You know, his father was abusive and shit like this.  What do you expect?  The poor guy, you know, he was a super mega star when he was five years old.  He never grew up properly.  All these things.  It's a perfect fucking trap.  That's what it is.  It's a trap.  It's a trap.  It's like a honey trap, a fly trap, right?  You fly, oh, there's the Michael Jackson.  I'm just gonna go land.  Oh, you're stuck.  Now you're there.  Now we've got you.  Your energy is gonna be there for a while because now you've taken a side and you've emotionally invested yourself in our machinations.  There's no reason for this shit to come out.  There's no reason.  These kids, these families here, are making gazillions and gazillions of dollars.  They were making millions back then when they were prostituting their children, if any of it's true to begin with, right?  Like any of it's true to begin with.  The whole thing could be completely concocted from day one.  Michael Jackson was always a major part of the New World Order.  I mean, you see it on all his albums, you know, where he's got all the symbolism everywhere, right?  Here's a good example, right?  Michael Jackson here.  I mean, the all-seeing eye.  I mean, he's got all the symbols, the pillars, the Freemasonry.  It's all there.  But the thing is, Michael Jackson is a fictional character to begin with.  That's the whole thing that people can't compute.  The average person doesn't realize this.  This is a fictional character.  Yeah, physically, there probably was some twisted creature called Michael Jackson that actually existed.  But was he really what whatever the media was depicting him at whatever time?  Or was it more like, let's create this character and let's build them up to the nth degree and then let's have them crash down.  And then we could use them forever more.  We can kill them off.  Now, think about this too.  When somebody like Elvis... You could say Elvis.  I mean, they do this to so many of their celebrities.  You could go back throughout here.  You get the 27 Club, for instance, right?  You could talk about a lot of the very mysterious celebrity deaths, including Chris Cornell, CC33, recently, of course.  And you can see all the satanic sort of imagery and programming that's involved with that particular character.  But yeah, they can do this forever, evermore.  Elvis is a perfect example because Elvis died and practically nobody saw his body.  So there's always going to be conspiracies forevermore.  Elvis is still alive.  So the same thing with Michael Jackson.  Did he die naturally?  Was he murdered?  And it's not meant to be resolved.  It's meant to occupy you so that decades in the future, people are still examining the evidence.  And that's ultimately what it is.  I mean, it programs you into a lot of different things.  You could say it's normalizing pedophilia.  Yeah, you can argue a lot of those things, sure.  But if you invest yourself emotionally in any way, shape, or form, that you are in that fly trap.  You've got on the sticky tape.  You're on the sticky tape.  What I'm trying to say is don't go anywhere near the sticky tape.  Stay far away from the fucking sticky tape of the fucking New World Order.  There's no point because there's no resolve.  It's not meant to be resolved.  This is much more about massive social conditioning, massive programming.  They're experimenting continuously with us.  Michael Jackson conspiracies will never go away as long as they can use him.  As long as he is somebody that they can use.  you know rehash over and over again.  he will continue to be used again and again and that's why it's all over the disney media.  the disney media goes crazy.  well it's all the same.  and then if you think about the symbolism neverland peter pan all that you know is michael jackson.  peter pan Yes.  Yes.  It's one and the same.  They're fictional fucking characters, folks.  What I would say to folks is you just the best method I could say for any individual.  I honestly would say this.  I would make a blanket statement like this.  I would say this.  All of humanity would be better off if everyone smashed their televisions.  Everyone would be better off.  I think depression levels would drop precipitously.  I think a lot of people would re-engage with society and humanity and rediscover how important social interaction, immediate social interactions are in all this.  I think that That we would be so much better off and I would say this for every single human being on on the planet.  I Would say if every single human being had no idea who Lady Gaga was every single human being would be a tiny little bit better Because these people are not real.  they're fictional characters.  there's nothing about them that should be remotely interesting to you.  you should turn your back on it all and And you should just, if you're going to look at it, look at it as mass social programming.  Look at it as Tavistock Institute, you know, types of social programming that they're manipulating public consciousness, that they're programming the masses.  O.J.  Simpson is another great example.  I mean, you could go on forever about these characters.  And it's perfect.  There's never a resolve.  There's always going to be a left-right.  There's always going to be a debate.  There's always going to be people that are adamantly hating Michael Jackson and people that are just hopelessly idolizing Michael Jackson.  The answer is simple.  The answer is turn your back on it.  If you turn your back on it, and if enough people turn their back on it, it'll disappear.  So Michael Jackson has no relevance whatsoever.  And don't make the mistake of thinking Michael Jackson was somebody who was going to reveal the Illuminati or that they killed him off.  He was every bit a much a part of it.  His character, his fake fucking fictional character was just draped in New World Order symbolism on a daily basis.  So stay away from your programming.  Protect yourself.  Protect your children from these fake characters.  There's nothing real about it.  Thanks so much for taking the time to listen.  I hope you enjoyed the video.  And if you can, come and support me on my Patreon.  Link's in the description.  And I look forward to reading your comments.  And hey, it's okay to be a fan of Michael Jackson's music.  I liked a couple of his early songs.  Still listen to them now and again.  It's kind of like a guilty pleasure.  But I would never, ever, ever emotionally invest myself in anything to do with Michael Jackson.  Ever.  Ever.  I'll listen to a song, and as long as I think the song is not massive sort of new world order programming, I can enjoy it.  I can enjoy a funky beat.  I can enjoy a good melody.  Why not?  When it's like that, it's not too harmful.  But everything else that comes with it is all just your programming.  Thanks for taking the time to listen.  I hope you have a wonderful day. ",
