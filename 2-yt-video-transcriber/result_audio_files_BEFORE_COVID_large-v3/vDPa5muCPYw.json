            "text": "Greetings family.  Welcome to Shark's Cove.  Way over there are tide pools.  They're different depths.  And because of that, the salt inside of the water, the minerals, it refracts the light.  And depending on the depth, if it's a very deep, you know, tide pool, might be about 80 degrees, 85 degrees.  If it's a shallow one, the refraction, the concentration of light is higher, and it might be about 88 degrees, maybe 90 degrees.  Each one of those tide pools is indigenous to its own lives as well.  You might have one that has just yellow tangs.  You might have one that has nothing but starfish or just eels.  They're all different.  You can see the people swimming in them, very easy.  You just put your mask on and swim from one tide pool to the next.  There's a tide pool out there that's filled with sea urchins.  In Japan, the sea urchin is called uni.  Uni.  And they feed them corn.  because the sea urchin, you know, feeding on the corn, it makes the sea urchin sweet, very sweet.  It makes me believe that there is such a thing as unicorns.  Sorry, you'll get it later.  Now, from these shallow pools, look.  All of a sudden, the water gets a little deeper.  You see, in the Caribbean, the islands are flat, limestone.  But in Hawaii, they're volcanoes.  And at the water level, when you go out into the water, it still keeps dropping.  In fact, look, over here, I'll take you over there in a second.  This area, it's about 100, 120 feet deep.  It used to be a cone.  but the cone imploded on that side and opened up to the ocean which drops to the abyss to the bottom of the ocean probably about a good four or five miles down there.  the mariana trench is about seven miles deep.  but right here are the scuba divers.  i'll show you the scuba divers are on the other side of the tree because it's deeper right here.  so you go from the shallow pool area that's well protected by that reef that has a lot of caves over there.  Do you notice there's a bunch of them over there?  Into the deafness and over into the real dark water where it gets super deep.  I'd say it's about, I'd say there's probably about Anywhere from 40 to 50 different type of species of fish.  And there's schools of fish.  And they're big fish and not little ones like you would find over there.  Come, let me show you the deeper part.  Oh, that's the basin.  Just amazing.  Come, family.  Over there.  Come on over here, Tink.  Over there is those tide pools we was talking about to the far left.  and you can see the water splashing up against the barrier and then the caves.  then all of a sudden that light turquoise water starts to turn darker.  and right here it gets to about 50 feet.  and right over there are the scuba divers.  and right over here you can almost see because it's a beautiful day the bottom.  you can see the rocks and the coral down there.  now over here You see that wall?  You see that cave right there and that cave over there?  Here, let me see if I can point at them.  Right there, right there.  There's red lobsters.  You can see the little red lobsters antennas.  If they're small antennas, you don't mess with them.  If they're long ones, well then, there's a good chance that you can take it.  And over there is another cave right there where those people are at.  That is so beautiful.  The cave is in the back.  And the front where they're at, that turquoise water, is because it's all pure sand.  And that's why it's a crystal light blue turquoise color.  Now, over here on that ledge, on that ledge, me and five other scuba divers, one time we walked from here all the way where those rocks are at up to the ledge up there, went all the way to the end.  Way out there at the very end is this lava tube. ",
