            "text": "Welcome back.  You're here with Goldberg.  Today we're going to be doing a follow-up to my video on.  there's no true or real capitalism.  In this case, we will discuss socialism.  And as you know, whenever this subject comes to the forefront, there's those folks who basically, they'll read the initial socialist or communist manifesto and block out the possibility of, you know, human nature being flawed, which we know it is.  They'll claim you have to take it on a face value like a utopia, which is a joke, of course.  But then they'll go on to argue that any historical example of socialism or communism is illegitimate to use to criticize socialism because of the various reasons their corporations of the cia involved.  or it was uh... russian soviet militarism and nationalism.  it wasn't true socialism.  well you know it could work if only there were less white people involved.  if we got down to the people of the disenfranchised in the socialist system would be successful because they're not driven by greed or racism.  Or, oh no, we need socialist democracy, which I guess they abbreviate as SUCDEM.  And in that case, it's nonviolent.  Well, yeah, I mean, social democracy is perhaps less of a problem, but there's an illusion that it is on an opt-in, opt-out basis.  Because obviously, if you don't want to pay for the centralized health care program, you're not going to be given an option.  You're probably going to go to prison if you don't want to pay those taxes.  There's always an element of coercion.  There's always a movement for the state to accumulate more power and take away freedom in the argument that it's good for everyone and you can't be trusted with your own autonomy.  So you can search long and far, but actually one of the best examples of socialism manifested is not the Venezuela, Soviet Union, Pol Pot, Mao.  Those are just the ones we hear frequently.  One of the best examples is actually the settlement, the colony of Jonestown.  You can say, no, no, no, you can't say that, that was a cult.  Actually, it wasn't.  It was a highly political movement.  Jim Jones himself, he started out as a charismatic preacher, but at a certain point he read, it was a verse in corinthians where he determined that the bible condones slavery and you shouldn't really focus on the text just on the idea and his idea was allowed.  divine socialism so i guess that's a subset is not the true communist socialism.  but as you can see uh... jim jones would would fit in pretty well the tumblr east those and the progressive democrats of today and that's not an exaggeration by by any means.  Real quick on the subject of being able to have a choice, when it came to Jonestown towards the end, or if you actually arrived there, you couldn't really leave.  If you tried to leave, you would have, like, your food poisoned or drugged, you would have to give up your passports when you got there, so again, the illusion of choice, which is always discussed, doesn't quite match up.  Jones said that he wanted to create a colony that would be free of sexism, racism, and elitism.  This freedom land.  But as we see, you didn't really have freedom to leave if you wanted to.  So what were the principles that he argued for?  Diversity.  More mixing to break the patriarchy.  This also included, by the way, men taking the surnames of their wives because they thought that would help kind of be a strong blow against the traditionalism and the strictures of the past.  In the educational system there, they made a big point of emphasizing stuff like, you know, black is beautiful, respecting Ebonics, respecting these underprivileged cultures.  Whether you agree with that or not, the point is this is something you hear a lot today.  You know, we need these studies of, you know, dispossessed, post-colonial, that sort of thing.  We need to respect these various cultural groups that you haven't heard about.  We need to introduce them into the educational system.  Marriage is bourgeois.  They made a big attempt at dismantling families.  Your children were raised communally.  You didn't get to make that decision.  This is very much a progressive and socialist ideal.  It takes a village.  You can't be trusted to raise your own kids.  It's too much of a risk.  You have to hand that power over to the collective organization.  or to the state.  They even had a relationship committee which would help decide who you could date, and in some cases whether or not you had to voluntarily become cuckolded.  So, for instance, if someone in the leadership, like it was Jim Jones at one point, he actually had a guy agree that he could impregnate his wife and made the guy, I think, sign a paper making that agreement.  one of the doctors in question he wanted a particular girl he found attractive.  that was okay.  that works as far as part of the program.  so this is very much the same essence where you know the community the the committee has to decide.  I was talking about this when it came to the Dell Spooner man with the robots.  yes we need a committee to just decide your fate in your future.  you can't do that as an individual because you can't be trusted.  So as far as the accusations of this being some crazy cult, it was actually very well enmeshed and established with the Democratic Party and the Civil Rights Movement.  People like Cecil Reed, Moscone, Harvey Milk, never heard about that in the Gus Van Sant documentary with Sean Penn, of course.  Even Jimmy Carter, his wife was very close to Jim Jones.  This guy was a powerful, influential guy in the progressive left.  He was seen as a visionary because he was more radical than the main line of the Democratic Party.  So that gives you a sense because people will try to brush it off.  They'll say these were just dumb people who followed a cultist.  No, these were actually well-educated people.  In fact, one of the ladies there who had a background, she was well-educated.  She liked reading, going to theaters, whatnot.  She was one of the primary teachers, she actually said, I don't approve of it, but I'll essentially agree, I'll assent to it.  Some of the crazy stuff that started happening.  Because this is, when an ideology, when you have this idea of the collective, you stop actually, you know, stopping to consider, well, wait a second, does this make any sense?  No, because it's good for the socialist community, the ideal of sorts.  Jonestown itself was built from scratch.  They chose Guyana because they had overthrown the British.  It was led by Forbes Burnham, who was a big-time social democratic guy, overthrowing the oppressors, getting rid of the whites, allowing the indigenous people to have control, taking away the chains of oppression.  Now, in some respects, that's a good thing.  Imperialism did some negatives, without a doubt, but the point is The setting was such that it's very hard to make the argument, oh yeah, it was just corrupted because of corporations or was corrupted because of, it wasn't true socialism.  No, they literally went to the rainforest and cleared land and started building farms, started planting various different crops, and you lived communally.  Unless you were in charge.  If you were in charge, you got much better food.  In fact, towards the end, they were eating rice that had weevils inside of it and people were getting chronic constipation, which is usually what happens when you have a system that is broadly based on this communal idea, is that it starts to break down, especially if you have problems with producing enough food, for instance.  uh... let's see what else we had here.  uh... he claimed that this is going to be a place where you can have a child without pain.  that sounds quite enticing.  he would have people sign over their checks and also their social security money to him.  so he was getting like it was like thirty five grand a month or something in terms of payments not funded by corporations and i suppose indirectly for people salaries.  but this was literally people giving their money to the collective.  that was the idea.  You can't have anything that this other person doesn't have, unless of course you're at the top of the pile, which is usually what occurs in these socialist systems.  uh... okay and what happened if you did not go along?  well this is coming back to raising kids in a communal fashion.  if kids were disruptive if kids didn't want to go along if they didn't agree with what was going on they started to see things their parents didn't.  some things they would do.  they would hit them with boards take them in a dark room and say that a blue-eyed monster was coming to get them make monster noises and then attach them to like electrodes and shock them or hang them down into a well by their ankles and have other adults in the well grab at them pretending to be monsters.  they're benevolent.  you know it takes a village.  this is what villagers do.  i suppose We already talked about the voluntary cucking.  Another thing he would do in order to get people to commit to this radical socialist and ultimately revolutionary suicide cause was to write out confessions for crimes you'd never committed.  This was rampant if you've seen socialist societies.  They use it for blackmail.  So you had a guy who educated, intelligent guy, but he was part of the group.  And he actually wrote a confession to molestation of his kids as part of this whole thing of how loyal are you to the cause and how loyal are you to me?  And that way, if they tried to leave, they'd say, we're going to publish this confession incriminating you.  Again, you don't really have a choice in a socialist society because at a certain point, it's going to try to envelop you.  Yeah, if people came to visit Jonestown, they would drug those who were skeptics, they would clean stuff up, kind of like the Potemkin villages.  A lot of socialism ultimately comes down to trying to present a positive ideal, when of course, in fact, it's not quite that way in the end.  And then you have people who were skeptical, you'd have these coordinators, reassurers, troubleshooters, trying to you get you back on the right path.  we don't want you to stray too far.  we we got.  ensure that you understand what's going on your sticking with the mission.  if you tried to leave they would call them white fascist bigots.  if you were trying to leave the diversity community uh... and just show you how extreme people can become.  there was a mom who is so committed to it.  she said i will be had my kids and then kill myself if my kids try to leave.  There was a 23-year-old who volunteered to help kill babies, this being a female, of course, which is quite astonishing even today.  Jones himself said, I'm talking about planning your death for the victory of the people, for socialism, for communism, for black liberation.  For oppressed peoples.  And you have to note here that he specifically would routinely call out the United States as like a fascist, racist power.  That's why they had to start from scratch in order to build a community based upon a qualitarian acceptance where you wouldn't have this kind of problem.  You had one boy that he went off and tried to plant some fruit for himself so he could have his own kind of plot.  He got punished.  They ended up putting him in this, basically, it was like a shipping box, totally dark, in order to make him understand that you're not allowed to do that.  You can't break from the pack.  You can't be yourself.  You can't have any individuality.  towards the end when they were going to do the uh... the mass suicide this girl christine miller she said i think we all have a right to our own destiny as individuals.  and uh... jones and all his socialists shouted her down and said basically be quiet we gotta go along with it.  and there's other forms of it in terms of blackmail.  someone would come there they'd offer them a medical exam and then claim that they had some kind of you know major std people informing on each other even if you have a romantic relationship with someone.  if they were skeptical of the group uh... you heard about that in bed.  you would then report it.  so this is the level to which people go.  and again it comes down to the problem which is human nature.  now maybe that says some poor things about the species but humans are greedy.  humans do like power and that's why even when his own people.  His followers were starting to not really get nutrition.  They were starving.  He was still sitting there with his nicer food supply.  This is the natural thing.  Human beings don't like to be just like everyone else.  Maybe in terms of fitting in, but as far as possessions go, they don't like that.  That's why some people buy a bigger house or a nicer car.  It's an essence of what it means to be human.  Now, you can say that's just because of the modern society, but even you can go back For generations, that's what it's been about.  People do like to hoard wealth.  They do like to enjoy certain qualities.  They work towards things.  And socialism doesn't give them that, which is why usually socialism, the top starts rotting and then just goes down from there.  And unfortunately with Jonestown, it ended up being extremely destructive.  People can call it a cult, but then you look at other socialist regimes, how many people they killed, it's not that hard to understand why.  It's always about control.  It doesn't matter how it's wrapped up as freedom or fighting tolerance or intolerance, promoting equality.  It ultimately comes down to taking away civil liberties and trying to mold you into the perfect socialist worker. ",
