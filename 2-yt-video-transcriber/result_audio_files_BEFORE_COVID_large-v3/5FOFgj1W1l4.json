And core moral principles on which it is built are two.  That is, one is the freedom of conscience, and the other one is equal dignity of every person and equal voice in running the public affairs.  And it would seem to me that although it seems that we are in the process of anti-democratization, so to speak, in the world today, nonetheless, for many people, these two core or three core principles, they remain stable.  And I think I would want to build upon these principles and strengthen so that we can build the kind of institutions that are appropriate to local situations, but that embody these two principles.  We'll have plurality, then we'll have the ability to live together as different. ",

            "text": "Let me say something, the way I see it.  Russia is not a liberal democracy, and though it has certain people, certain, I would say, virtual community of those who say that they share these liberal democratic principles, but actually they do not, because they have their own little dictatorship, and you cannot trust them in no way.  Now, what happens?  Russia is an autocratic state, always has been, always.  It was never interrupted by any democracy at all.  So you have to take that into consideration, talking about this country.  It's the same thing as with many Middle Eastern countries, governments, they are based on different principles which Americans who enter the country did not understand.  They may have been horrible in many ways, but you should not break these principles or suggest some Western approach to Iraq or whatever.  Otherwise, you get what you get.  Now, about Russia.  There are people in Russia who, not being Christians, No.  But having this really loving hearts, understand that some huge problems should be dealt with.  One of them is no doctors and no hospitals for children with oncology.  Right?  So in order to build these hospitals out of nowhere, the government doesn't want to listen about it, doesn't want to hear.  There was a woman, an actress, Chulpan Hamatova is her name.  She couldn't stand it, she couldn't see it.  She had some money of her own and she was very loved by people.  She's a good actress and a very nice person.  She started this program trying to make the government build this huge hospital for children with oncological diseases.  In order to get some money, to fundraise, she went as far as to meet Putin, and he was, because no one wanted actually to say, yes, finally, here's my signature.  All money that was promised was somewhere disappeared quickly.  There were many marathons, fundraising marathons, but money did disappear.  So she needed support, real solid support.  So she went as far as to meet Putin.  And he helped her.  So the hospital with all doctors, everything was built.  Now this liberal public started hating Chulpan.  They hated her so much, they just shamed her.  They said all kind of dirty things about her because she dared to contact Putin.  And Putin is bad, and Putin is a dictator, so to hell with your ill children.  The moral principles are much more important for them.  This is one extreme case.  And another one is right now, these days, yesterday I read more news about it, there is another woman Anna Federmesser.  She and her mother, her late mother, were the founders of the hospices for terminally ill, for people who are terminally ill, because these people, they didn't get And in relief, they couldn't get painkillers, nothing like that.  They just stayed in their apartments in horrible pain.  They did great work, and they built hospices all around the cities.  And they saved this pain and this lost... you know, sufferings for many people.  And also, she went as high, as far as first the mayor of Moscow, whom everyone hates for many reasons, and then up to Putin.  So the last I saw yesterday was her photo.  She and Putin, they sit in front of each other and discussing things.  When I see these photos, I know that the people who, and it may be me tomorrow, who will suffer from this incruciating pain with no way out, because the only way out is dying.  She's saving their people.  You cannot imagine the wave of hatred that this liberal public had pushed against her.  It's like a tsunami.  So to hell with these people who have moral principles.  I prefer staying with those who have this heart, going to children and old people.  They gain nothing. ",

No, wait, wait.  But one of the things you learn about all forms of progress is that progress is never linear.  And it's never inevitable and it's never irreversible.  So that the struggle, there will never come a time when the whole world will be once and for all liberal democratic.  It's like the beginning of that film Mr.  Incredible when they're interviewing and they say to him, aren't you tired of rescuing people?
