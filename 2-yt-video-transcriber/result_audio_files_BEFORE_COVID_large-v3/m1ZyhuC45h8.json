            "text": "Welcome back guys, I'm Sean with Blue Ridge Silverhound and today we're going to talk about your top five Lincoln pennies from the 1960s.  Believe it or not, if you found the right one, these coins can be worth over five figures.  Five figures.  And no, I'm not talking about the cents, silly goose.  But we're talking about coins that reach into the tens of thousands of dollars.  I'm going to go over the top five Lincoln cents on the list and I'm going to tell you why and what you need to do in order to make it happen.  These are coins that command a ton of money by discerning Lincoln cent enthusiasts.  So there is a huge market for these.  But before we get started, as always, I got to go ahead and do the good old usual thing, and that's tell you a little bit about my channel.  If you haven't done so, subscribe, hit the bell for instant notifications.  The reason why that's important is so that way you could get those instant notifications of a new video upload.  In addition, I will be doing lots of summer giveaways.  All right, so gift cards, silver coins, you name it.  I am giving back to the subscribers and the patrons that have made my channel what it is today.  I want to thank everyone again for all the views and support.  And because of that, yeah, we're going to be doing some pretty, pretty nasty, nasty giveaways.  I can't wait to get started.  So let's go ahead and get started on these five Lincoln cents.  In one capacity or another, we have ripped open many rolls of Lincoln cents.  if you're an avid coin roll hunter or perhaps you go through your pocket change after you break a dollar at a restaurant or a coffee bar.  look in there and then there's a right really nice bright shiny almost brand new coin that is probably 30 40 even 50 years old.  these coins believe it or not have a value.  all right yes some of them might be super plentiful in the landscape of mintages of these coins but if you found the right one all right it could be worth a fortune.  so the first coin i wanted to talk about is the 1962 lincoln cent.  all right this is a coin much like any other coin during the 1960s in which there is a ton of them produced.  however if you found the right one that graded a mint state 60 68 red through pcgs or even ngc you have a coin that could be worth a ton of money.  now here's the thing.  there is only one coin graded at 68 red through pcgs.  currently That coin has never made it out into the open market, which leaves a lot of opportunity for some lucky treasure hunter to find one, send it off to a third party grader, have it come back at this huge grade and possibly make a huge amount of money.  So PCGS has a price guide value on a 1962 Lincoln Cent at $10,000 in 68 red.  The highest recorded sale ever of this particular date was not a 68, but instead it was a mid-state 67 red, a grade point lower, back february 2014 on heritage auctions in the amount of 8 813. okay this is a coin that you're gonna have to keep an eye out on.  uh it is one of the big hits in the lincoln cent series.  So the next coin that we have here is a 1961 D. All right.  So this is the Denver minted Lincoln cent variant, of course, as a tiny little letter D underneath the date.  That's how you'll know what you have there.  If you found one that is stunningly beautiful.  amazing, like the one that you see on screen here, it could make you a ton of money.  This one is a huge question mark because the highest grade through PCGS is a Mid-State 67+, in which there is only one example graded at that level.  Now PCGS doesn't have an official price guide value on a 67 plus because one never made it to the market.  But I would say that this coin is gonna be similar to the 1962 preceding this coin at around $10,000.  The highest recorded sale of this particular coin was actually only a mint state 67.  It was not a plus.  This one sold on Heritage Auctions June 2014 in the amount of $4,406.  This is another important date to be on the lookout for in your change and in coin rolls.  Every day people come across these type of coins that exude such brilliance and perfection that if you were able to find one, you have a coin that's going to be worth a boatload of money.  Real life change money, might I add.  So the third coin on the list is going to be a 1962D.  So we're talking about another Denver minted coin right here.  In much similar fashion as the 61D beforehand, the top grade is the Mid-State 67 Plus, full red through PCGS, in which only one example exists at this grade.  Now at a 67 plus, PCGS assigned a price guide value of $8,500.  Quite a bit of money.  The highest recorded sale of such a coin was actually a Mint State 67.  Heritage Auctions listed a coin back September of 2014 in the amount of $3,290, which at the time is a ton of money and a lot, a lot of opportunity if you know exactly what you're looking for.  So that's the 1962D.  It is by far one of the toughest dates during the 1960s to find a brilliant red example that grades out above Mint State 66.  Will you be able to find one?  So the fourth coin on the list is another favorite of mine.  All right, it's a 1963.  This is the Philadelphia minted coin that you see here.  This example right here, again, much like the previous two coins, the top grade is Mint State 67+, in which only one example exists at this grade level.  So it's pretty rare.  Just about unique.  If you're able to find the second example and have it grade at a 67 plus full red, PCGS has a price guide value of $8,500 at this grade level.  No coins at this grade level have been sent to the auction block as of yet.  There is one known, probably in a registry set somewhere.  The highest recorded sale of a 1963 P Lincoln cent was on Heritage Auctions July of 2015 in the amount of $1,939.  And this is for just a mint state 67 red.  So adding that plus in there makes this coin exponentially more, more valuable.  So we have one more coin.  It is going to be probably one of the toughest coins to find at the highest grade level.  Okay, this is a coin I've talked about in the past as being one of the toughest and it rivals the 1963D.  In this case, it's the 1964 Lincoln Cent.  Many of these were made, but so few of them were ever preserved at the highest mint state.  The top grade for a 1964P Lincoln cent is mint state 67 plus full red through PCGS.  And guess what?  There is only one graded at this level.  Now, if you were able to find and grade a second example of a Mint State 67 Plus, PCGS has a price guide value assigned of $13,500.  It is the highest on the list, and with good reason.  This coin is one of the rarest Lincoln cents to find above Mint State 67.  The highest recorded sale of a 1964 Lincoln cent was back on January 2016 on Heritage Auctions in the amount of $7,931.  I remember this sale.  It's huge.  Just think, if it was half a grade point higher with that plus, this would be a coin that sold in excess of $10,000.  Now some of you are going to ask me where exactly exactly is going to be the best opportunity to find and locate coins of this condition.  Pocket change.  You never know when these things will pop up in pocket change at the highest grade level.  It's happened before.  For those of you that coin roll hunt, that's another great opportunity to find some of these coins.  I come across tons of mint state 1960s and 1970s Lincoln cents on a weekly basis just by coin roll hunting.  But your best bet in all of this is going to be searching through Brilliant uncirculated rolls full date rolls of these coins as if they were released at the time of minting Another Avenue.  another outlet in which you could find some of these coins is simply to go through a full $50 face canvas bag of that particular date.  Now keep in mind when you go out and you're buying bu rolls or you're buying brand new canvas bags you know that have never been gone through.  these products are going to command a serious amount of premium above face value so let me just throw that out there.  it's almost like a lottery shot.  alright you pay a lot of money in the hopes of finding something big which it can happen if you know what you're looking for.  so with that being said that rounds out the top five 1960s Lincoln cents that sell for a tremendous amount of money and only one are known at that grade level of each state respectively.  So when you go out to look for these coins, keep these on the top of your mind, all right?  Keep in mind that you will have to send these off to grading in order to achieve the highest grade level.  And even if they don't hit the highest grade level, let's say they end up at like 67, will still sell for a lot of money.  okay there is a safety net in all of this.  so i want to thank everyone for joining in on this particular episode.  it was a lot of fun to discuss some of the rarest 1960s lincoln cents.  that's worth a ton of money.  one of the most expensive decades in lincoln pennies is during the 60s.  don't forget to like share and subscribe and as always hit the bell for instant notifications.  i'm going to be doing giveaways all summer long.
