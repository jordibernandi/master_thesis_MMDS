So my question is, how do you rectify your notion of democratic socialism with the failures of socialism in nearly every country that has tried it? ",

            "text": "And do you think that... Thank you for asking that question.  Is it your assumption that I supported or believe in authoritarian communism that existed in the Soviet Union?  I don't.  I never have.  And I opposed it.  I believe in a vigorous democracy.  But you have asked me the question about democratic socialism.  Fair question.  And let me answer it.  I happen to believe.  that in the United States, there is something fundamentally wrong when we have three families owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, 160 million people.  Something wrong when the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 92%, something very wrong when 49% of all new income today is going to the top 1%.  And something is equally wrong when we have a corrupt political system made even worse by this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which allows billionaires to spend unlimited sums of money to elect candidates who represent the wealthy and the powerful.  So answer number one to your question, It's a radical idea.  Maybe not everybody agrees, but I happen to believe we should have a government that represents working families and not just the 1% and powerful corporations.  All right, that's point number one.  Point number two, what do I mean when I talk about democratic socialism?  It certainly is not the authoritarian communism that existed in the Soviet Union and in other communist countries.  This is what it means.  It means that we cherish, among other things, our Bill of Rights.  And Franklin Delano Roosevelt made this point.  Chris, I don't know if you remember, I read about it, 1944, in a State of the Union address that never got a whole lot of attention.  This is what he said, basically.  It was a very profound speech toward the end of World War II.  He said, you know, we've got a great Constitution.  Bill of Rights protects your freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and all that stuff, great.  But you know what it doesn't protect?  It doesn't protect and guarantee you economic rights.  So, Samantha, let me be very honest with you.  I believe that in a democratic, civilized society, health care is a human right.  Government should make that happen.  I believe that every young person in this country, regardless of his or her income, has the right to get all of the education they need.  That's why I have fought hard with some success to move toward making public colleges and universities tuition free and very substantially reduce student debt.  And I believe that there is something wrong in America today when you've got millions of families paying 40, 50, 60 percent of their limited incomes to put a roof over their heads and that millions of working class families, young parents cannot find quality and affordable child care.  So I happen to believe that we have to address the issue of grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality, very, very rich, getting much richer, middle-class struggling, 40 million people living in poverty.  And what democratic socialism means to me is we expand Medicare, we provide educational opportunity to all Americans, we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.  In other words, government serves the needs of all people rather than just wealthy campaign contributors.  That's what that means to me. ",

And it's so fucking annoying to me that these kinds of people ask the question and then they never listen to the answer.  Because you would know, you know, when he said it the first time or the second time or the fucking 92nd time, you would have gotten it.  Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  I got it.  But I guarantee you he's going to be asked this question again.  Now, ultimately, we shouldn't be complaining because this is a softball down the center of the plate, and he can knock it out of the park every time.  But I'm just, like, frustrated at the fact that there are still these people that exist that are like, I'm gonna get him.  Hey, Bernie.  Soviet Union.  And, by the way, you'll see it again with Venezuela.  You'll see it again with Cuba in some instances.  The real idiots will go as far as, like, Pol Pot and fucking Stalin, bro.  bro, you're on the left?  Stalin was on the left, bro.  Wrecked, bitch.  Like, oh my god, you guys are so dumb.  Your mom lied to you.  There is such a thing as a stupid question, and you just heard it.  Now, coming to find out that the person who asked that question is from the Harvard Centrist Society.  And the Harvard Centrist Society is exactly. ",
