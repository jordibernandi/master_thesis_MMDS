Well, What did Baby Bunny find in the middle of the path?  A big, juicy, delicious-looking grape.  It was purple.  Oh, I'm so happy, said Baby Bunny, and he said grace.  But when he opened his eyes again, the grape was gone.  Where is my grape?  asked Baby Bunny.  Ha, ha, ha, you mean my grape.  It was Bad Bird.  That's my grape, said Baby Bunny.  I found it.  You were too slow, said Bad Bird.  It's my grape now.  Baby Bunny cried.  Why are you crying, said someone.  Who was that?
