And I'm very, very reassured by the words of the Deputy Senate President that says that you are a good product and we can ask you any question.  Which means... that you know the law inside out.  The Constitution in the fifth schedule, section 11, defines the duties of the code of conduct of public officers.  Yet, yet, There is a committee going around usurping the functions of the Code of Conduct Guru called the Oblak Committee, the Presidential Committee on Asset Recovery.  Tell us and tell Nigerians.  as a promoter and a defender of the law that you have said, why you have not defended all these people that have been illegally asked by a committee to come and give asset accounts or whatever to them because that committee is not in this constitution.  And I know you will do justice to this.  Question, hasn't he answered? ",

            "text": "Thank you very much.  I'll ask you that question.  On the code of conduct.  and its provisions vis-a-vis the so-called powers, like you put it, of the presidential panel on recovery of property.  That's a problem.  The problem is that you allow the law to remain in your books.  That law was passed in 1984.  The law regarding... recovery of public property.  It was a decree.  And when we now, I'm finished.  I'll tie it in.  And when we now transited to civil rule, they said all those laws now become acts of parliament.  And so that law says the president has powers to set up any panel to recover public property.  Let me tell you the difference.  Let me tell you the difference.  The Code of Conduct is a constitution, did not, no, hold on, sir, with respect, sir, did not criminalize did not criminalize those provisions regarding the Code of Conduct.  It is that act that now makes it criminal offense.  That's the difference.  So it's not in conflict.  The Code of Conduct, they will only ban you from public office.  They will not send you to jail.  But that act now makes it a criminal offense.  So I am also the lead prosecutor to the panel at some point.  I'm the lead prosecutor.  And then the Court of Appeal has actually curtailed the powers now.  There's a judgment.  That the Court of Appeal says you cannot charge anybody to court.  You can only investigate.  And pass your investigation over to the Attorney General.  For the Attorney General to make a choice.  So there's a Court of Appeal judgment.  Anything beyond that is abuse of power.  Anything beyond that is abuse of power. ",
