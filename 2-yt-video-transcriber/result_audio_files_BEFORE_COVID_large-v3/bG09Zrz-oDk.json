            "text": "Well, the G20 summit is over with and not a whole lot happened except the US and China have agreed to a truce.  Well, actually not a truce, but a halt to escalation of the trade war.  They're not going to get rid of any of the tariffs that we've already imposed on each other, but we've agreed not to impose further tariffs and to continue the talks.  But the really big news isn't the G20 summit.  It's something that happened during the G20 summit.  that wasn't part of it.  The EU launched a new payment system called INSTEX, and it's operational.  Now, the remaining signatories of the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, they announced in a statement that the EU mechanism for trade with Iran is up and running, that INSTEX has already processed its first transactions.  INSTEX is aimed at facilitating trade with Iran by circumventing sanctions reimposed by the United States after President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal last year and said he wants a new agreement on American terms.  So this is really important.  This system makes systems like SWIFT, which is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications.  That's what SWIFT stands for.  It makes things like SWIFT obsolete.  to carry out changes, and under mounting pressure from Washington, SWIFT decided to remove Iranian banks from its networks last November.  So we froze them out of the global trade system by not allowing them to transfer currency under SWIFT.  With SWIFT, this was part of keeping the dollar the world's reserve currency.  The SWIFT system was designed so that if you had your local currency, you would convert those into dollars first, transfer the dollars to another country that you were paying, and then in that country, the recipient of the dollars would then transfer those back into their own currency.  So this is really, really big news that there's a system that the EU is using to bypass SWIFT and that France, Germany and the UK are sort of spearheading this.  And the next article, Trump.  to unleash hell on Europe, EU announces channel to circumvent SWIFT and Iran sanctions is now operational.  So what's happening here is we've been using the dollar as a weapon.  We've weaponized the dollar for many years.  And these are part of what I call the nails in the coffin of the global dollar standard.  I'll get to that in just a minute.  But now, instead of bashing our enemies over the head with the U.S.  dollar, using the dollar as a weapon for our enemies, We're now using it for our closest allies.  So this is really important.  In this article, it says that the announcement will likely send President Trump off the rails because in late May, Bloomberg reported that as part of Trump's escalating battle with the European allies, so here they're saying our allies, you know, we're in a battle with our allies over the fate of the Iranian nuclear accord.  He was threatening penalties against the financial body created by Germany, the UK, and France to shield trade with the Islamic Republic from U.S.  sanctions, including a loss of access to the U.S.  financial system.  And then the Treasury Department's Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence had written that I urge you to carefully consider the potential sanctions exposure of INSTEX.  He wrote that engaging in activities that run afoul of U.S.  sanctions can result in severe consequences, including the loss of access to U.S.  financial systems.  Germany, France, and the UK, these are our closest allies, finalized the INSEX system in January, allowing companies to trade with Iran without the use of US dollars or American banks, allowing them to get around wide-ranging US sanctions that were imposed after the Trump administration abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last year.  Now, the important thing here is that This was the first official shot across the bow of the US dollar's status as a global reserve currency.  And it's not the first.  I've been tracking these since 2009.  I'll show you that in a moment.  And not by America's adversaries, but by its closest allies.  And once those who benefit the most from the status quo openly revolt against it, the countdown to the end of the US dollar's reserve currency status officially begins.  Now, this is a presentation I think that I last updated in 2014 or 2015, and then the last frame in this is updated to the beginning of 2018. but i've actually been giving these presentations since two thousand nine.  i was one of the very first people to show that the world has had several different monetary systems in the past century and a half and that every thirty to forty years and we're fifty years into this monetary system now.  But there's stress cracks that develop in these systems and they start to implode.  And then there's an emergency meeting of G20 finance ministers and a bunch of economists and they hash out a new world monetary system.  And that day is coming soon.  I've been saying that within this decade, and I said this before this decade began, I said that within this decade there would be a currency crisis.  Well, it's possible that I might be late by a year or two.  But it's coming, and it's coming quickly, and it could still come before the end of this decade.  But when you travel the world, you go around the world and you use different currencies in different countries, but when you look inside their banks and their central banks, most of the currency in there is U.S.  dollars, and that's all used in international trade settlement.  But back in this, you know, like I said, this is back from 2014 or 2015.  These countries were avoiding demand for U.S.  dollars in trade by setting up bilateral trade agreements with each other.  And then there were other countries that where the use of dollar alternatives triggered war.  Then there's gold that's competing with currency and the physical accumulation of gold.  Now, if you look at the state of Utah, they had passed a legal tender act for gold.  Germany was wanting repatriation of their gold and so on.  Then citizens demanding repatriation.  Now, when the Bretton Woods system was created, that required all countries to hold U.S.  dollars.  So it flooded the world with U.S.  dollars because it was agreed that the U.S.  dollar would be the only currency fully convertible back to gold.  And so the US dollar became the world's reserve currency.  Nixon ended that in 1971, and we went on the global dollar standard.  And that was just fine for almost 30 years.  And then Saddam Hussein started selling oil for euros, and that was a threat to the dollar's global dominance.  Now, since then, there have been so many nails in the coffin.  I used to keep track of these all of the time, and they started coming so fast that I couldn't keep track of them anymore.  There are now several per week.  Sometimes they're big, sometimes they're small.  But you see here 23 countries set up swap lines to bypass the US dollar.  Russia, China, and India dropped the US dollar in bilateral trade.  Then the US passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, which requires all banks internationally, banks from every country, to report to the United States any accounts that they have for $10,000 or more for US citizens.  So if you're a US citizen with a foreign bank account, those banks have to report to the US.  Now, can you imagine Can you imagine Russia or China demanding the same thing of the  U.S.?  We would consider that sort of an act of war, that we had to disclose any of their citizens that had bank accounts in our country.  So these are how the nails in the coffin of the global dollar standard are coming more and more quickly every day.  Now to get back to these articles about the EU announcing their system to bypass SWIFT, the INSTEX system, the US has been weaponizing the dollar for years.  And it's a shame that we use it so many times.  We use it more often than we need to because there are instances where it probably should be used as a weapon.  But by threatening all of the other countries in the world, that if they don't participate by the rules that we're setting, that we're going to punish them, it just makes them want to bypass the dollar.  So here we've got Russian banks joining the Chinese alternative.  So China came up with the China International Payment System, also known as China's SWIFT.  to ease operations between countries.  But so China and Russia now do trade directly.  And this article is from March.  Then there's three Chinese banks tumble after U.S.  threatens to cut them off from SWIFT.  And these Chinese banks did get caught doing business directly with North Korea.  So there are instances where maybe this is justified.  But to be wielding this power so recklessly is getting countries all over the world to actively seek alternatives to the US dollar.  In May, a district judge ordered that three Chinese banks comply with U.S.  investigators' demands that they hand over records connected to the alleged movement of tens of millions of dollars in violation with international sanctions on North Korea.  And then an article on RT, which countries are dumping the U.S.  dollar.  Now, this is from a year ago, a little over a year ago.  But it talks about in here, can China succeed with the petroyuan, where Gaddafi failed, killing the U.S.  dollar in oil trade?  And this is about the Shanghai Futures Exchange launching oil contracts, oil futures.  And that brings me to an article about China begins to reset the world's reserve currency system.  And this is from September of 2017.  I reported on this a long time ago.  But this is according to the Brookings Institute, 34 central banks around the world have signed bilateral local currency swap agreements with the People's Bank of China as of the end of September 2016.  So this is a long time ago, including... the major oil producing countries.  With this new contract, and what they're talking about here is a futures exchange contract on the Shanghai Exchange where China's largest oil suppliers will now be able to transact directly with China, which is now the largest consumer of oil in the world.  and other oil importing countries using the yuan which are directly convertible into gold to settle the trade.  So in other words, an oil producer can sell China oil on their futures exchange, deliver the oil, cash in the contract which is denominated in yuan and directly, if they don't want the yuan, they can directly convert that into gold.  and that you know gold is good anywhere basically.  so this is something that is chipping away at the global reserve currency status of the dollar the uh?  the?  u the global u.s dollar standard and it's supported.  the?  the global u.s dollar standard is supported by the petrodollar.  it doesn't say petrodollar here but the?  you really should read this story will put a link here at the bottom the untold story behind saudi arabia's forty one year?  u s debt secret.  now this was a top secret deal that was made by the?  u s treasury secretary william simon during the nixon administration.  when nixon ended the gold backing of the?  u s dollar in august of nineteen seventy one this deal sort of took its place And in 2016, this was kept a secret from 1972 to 2016, that there was this petrodollar.  And this was an agreement, and Bloomberg got it released in 2016 through the Freedom of Information Act.  And what it disclosed is that there was this secret deal made where Saudi Arabia, we would buy oil from Saudi Arabia.  We printed those dollars to buy the oil.  They sell us the oil and they take the profits from that and they would reinvest them in U.S.  treasuries.  And this disclosed how big their U.S.  Treasury holdings were for the very first time.  This is Saudi Arabia, and these are the other countries.  But what it would do is lump all oil exporters together and report their Treasury holdings so it would keep the Saudi Arabian deal secret.  So this is coming to an end with the yuan-based oil contracts.  And now at the same time, there's countries around the world proposing gold-backed currencies.  This is the Malaysian prime minister proposing a regional currency that's based on gold, replacing the U.S.  dollar for trade there.  And now the Russian central bank is considering a gold-backed cryptocurrency.  So strap in because the impact from this is going to be huge.  In the three transitions to different global monetary systems that took place in the last century, the impact was only felt by the world's central banks, big international companies, and international banks.  This one is going to be felt by everyone.  You know, the last times it didn't affect the common man.  This one is going to affect everybody.  So it's time to figure out how this is going to affect you and to prepare for it and hopefully prosper from it instead of becoming a victim of it.  Thank you very much for listening.
