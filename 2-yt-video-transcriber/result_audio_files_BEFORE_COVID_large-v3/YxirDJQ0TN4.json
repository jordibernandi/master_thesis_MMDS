            "text": "Look, there's the Black Holocaust.  I knew it was prophecy.  A thousand times worse than the Jewish atrocities.  Uneven playing field, there'll never be a fair score.  Cause in 1619, that's when they declared war.  We the 12 tribes, the ones that the promise reaches.  Right?  What's your question, man?  Nah, I was just saying what y'all got.  You said what?  What'd you say?  Did you say it was racist?  Sure.  All right, all right, we're being racist, just so you know.  What's your question?  You up here for the UFC fight?  Yeah, man, yeah, we're going to go watch that.  Who are you working for?  Well, I got Izzy against Gaslam and then Holloway.  I think Holloway's going to win, but I'm going for the Southern boy if I'm going to win.  Oh, you're going for the Southern boy?  You know how it is.  You know how it is.  Okay, all right.  Okay, where was he at, man?  Where was he at?  I did a 59 and 20.  What's up?  What's up?  What question you got?  You know the Southern boys did that right there, right?  You know the Southern boys.  I'm just wondering about the white man's handiwork.  Yeah, that's what you did.  Hold on.  or it's made people my ancestors.  Yeah.  But I'm just... No, no, no, no, no.  I'm just wondering about like... Is that a lie of my line?  No, no, no, no, no.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm just wondering.  I'm just wondering.  You can say that.  Auburn, Alabama, right?  What was the city built on?  Hey, hey, roll tide.  But I'm wondering about evil.  I'm wondering about evil.  Is all white men are evil?  Is all white people evil?  All white people are evil.  All white people are evil.  That's not what the Bible preaches.  That's not what the Bible preaches.  Right supremacist Christianity?  No.  Yes, right supremacist Christianity.  No.  Where are you from?  Where am I from?  I'm from Israel.  No.  So now, give me, what do we got?  Habakkuk 2 and 4.  Is that what y'all believe?  Yes.  Y'all believe in hate?  Yes, we hate white people and we believe all of you are evil.  Habakkuk 2 and 4.  This is a book of Habakkuk 2 and 4.  Behold, his saying which is lifted up is not upright in him.  Say what.  the white man is not upright in him.  Thus saith the Lord.  Remember?  The church said look at his face.  That's right.  You said what?  You said what?  No, no, no.  The white man is the cover.  The white people are the cover, man.  That's what it comes down to.  Listen, listen.  You're the bevel.  You're the bevel.  The bevel is trying to trick me.  What's your question?  Beware of false prophets.  Beware of false prophets.  This is sad.  No, it's not religious.  This is sad.  This is sad.  Y'all thinking this is right?  This is not God.  This is not Jesus.  This is evil.  No, it's not.  He's a national figure.  He's the savior and the king of Israel.  But why would you want to claim him as one of your figures?  No, it's not.  I descend from a nation of people where Christ comes from.  This is my national heritage and culture.  It's not a religion.  A religion is something anybody can convert to.  I don't believe in that.  You can convert to being a Christian, you can convert to being a Muslim, any religion you want.  You cannot convert to being a part of a nation of people.  You can't do that.  Why?  Because God said so, man.  But it's not religious.  Of course not.  But God said so.  Yes.  So it's not religious, but God said so.  No, it's not religious.  Let me give you a history lesson.  You have a college on your chest, right?  Did you go to college?  All right.  So where did you study in college?  No, no.  Where?  Where did you study?  Where did you study?  No, no.  My bad.  I asked where.  What did you study?  Business, right?  So you never took any other disciplines in humanity or anything like that?  I was actually brought up in a private school in Amherst as a Catholic.  Okay, I went to Catholic school also.  So what we have to understand is we've got to go all the way back to the time when the Bible was being written, right?  Old Testament, right?  You deal with the Canaanites, the Moabites, the Ammonites.  These were all the neighbors of Israel, right?  They all had a God, right?  Every people had a God.  Israel had a God.  So the God that everybody talks about, God, God, God, is the God of Israel, right?  Not the God that everybody talks about because everybody has a different God.  Well, the main God, the Judeo-Christian God.  Who's Allah?  Well, that's the Arab's God.  That's not the God of the Bible.  You said you're Israel.  Uh-huh.  And you don't believe in Allah.  Of course not.  Israel, Israel, the God of Israel is what you think.  But also, why, if you're trying to prove a point to me, and trying to make me believe what you want to say, and you're saying that nothing you're saying, that you're saying nothing that you're saying is religion, but your main point is going back to God.  But you're not paying attention.  I was in the middle of explaining something to you.  You don't even have an attention span long enough to understand what I'm talking about.  You didn't understand the history of the New Yorks.  You have no idea about it.  How racist is that?  How racist is that?  How does he look like 2 Chainz?  How does he look like 2 Chainz?  We've already been told he's 2 Chainz.  You're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a god damn, you're a He that lives in captivity shall go into captivity.  Why give it to black people in the captivity?  Jesus Christ said you have to go into captivity for that.  Black people in the captivity.  Black people in the captivity.  Black people in the captivity.  Black people in the captivity.  Black people in the captivity.  Black people in the captivity.  Black people in the captivity.  Black people in the captivity.  That is one example.  That is one example.  That is one example.  That is one example.  That is one example.  That is one example.  That is one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  You used one example.  That's simple.  Because Jesus Christ is not this lily white boy.  He's a so-called black man.  And you people took his people.  I'll call those slayerships into slavery.  And he's not coming to let that go.  He's not just going to forgive and forget that.  Understand that.  So let's read Revelation 13 and 10 one more time.  Right?  She's with two chains.  The right man is the God damn government.  I'm going to tell you that now.  Read it.  And they're so uncivilized and they have such a low attention span, they can't even have a respectful conversation.  I'm explaining to him about how the evolution of national deities, I'm talking about collegiate level stuff here, but he's a college student and he can't even listen to that.  Why?  Because he's stupid, man.  Ain't nothing dumber than a redneck and a goddamn liberty.  I'm going to tell you that right now.  Right?  And y'all are coming out here all hyped up because it's a damn UFC fight.  Where are all these crackers every other Saturday?  They all are hyped up.  They came out the goddamn woods and all the backwoods of damn Georgia because there's some type of UFC event, man.  Don't let UFC hype you up, boy.  I'm going to tell you that now.  This is a book of revelations, chapter 13 and verse 10.  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.  So let me ask you something, brother.  Right?  Do white people lead blacks and Hispanics into captivity?  Did that happen?  Were Blacks and Hispanics led into captivity by white people in Australia?  You have no idea?  Where are your family from?  From Colombia.  From Colombia, right?  In Colombia, y'all had Spanish last names, right?  How did that happen, brother?  The indigenous Colombian did not speak Spanish, right?  Somebody came and made him speak Spanish, right?  They took us into captivity.  You see what I'm saying?  So God said, that's Jesus Christ now speaking.  He said, Jesus said you must go into captivity if you take people into captivity, right?  So if they took us into captivity, they gotta go.  You see what I'm saying?  Because us, blacks, Hispanics, and Native Indians, we're the true children of Israel.  That Jewish man, he's not the child of Israel.  Israel, this is us.  So-called Negro, so-called Hispanic, so-called Indians, right?  We are the true children of Israel.  So Jesus Christ is coming to avenge us from our enemies, right?  Give me Luke, not Luke, uh, uh, uh, Luke 1 and 67.  We're going to read that to prove what Jesus Christ came to do.  Because I said everybody got Mr.  Street out here.  They have no idea what the message of Jesus Christ was or the purpose of Jesus Christ was.  And that's where all the confusion comes in.  So read.  It's the broken leaf, chapter 1, verse 57.  And his father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people.  He's coming to visit and redeem his people, the Israelites, so-called blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.  Read on.  and have raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began, that we should be saved from our enemies.  Christ came to save his people from their enemies, man.  We're his people, so-called blacks, Hispanics, and native Indians.  And who is our enemy?  All these other nations, starting with the chief of our enemies, the so-called white man.  We're going to be saved from them.  That's what Christ, whose real name in the Hebrew is Yahushua, that's what he's coming to do.  Not nothing else.  Not save and hug everybody and start a rainbow coalition.  What he's coming to do is deliver... So-called blacks and Hispanics from their enemies, man.  Who have done nothing but rape, rob, murder, and extort them.  Who have built them?  Georgia and the whole country.  And really her empire, her continents.  All free labor and stolen land.  What's coming to this so-called white man is death.  I'm going to tell you that now.  What's coming to this so-called white man is everything that he did to the black Hispanic community many times too.  Because the Bible says reward her devil what she has rewarded thee.  That's point blank, period.  That's what's on the way.  Thus saith the Most High God, whose name in the Hebrew is Jehovah, man.  Right?  And he ain't send no cowards up here.  He sent prophets, mighty men of the Most High God.  I'm going to tell you that right now.  Ain't no damn word that will scare me out of no damn.  I'm going to tell you that now.  All right?  Ain't going to dictate nothing.  We doing everything to touch my belongings.  Ain't going to do none of that.  Right?  Because the Most High God wouldn't tolerate that vile beast and creature, that low creature.  Right?  To put his hands on the holy prophets or their holy things.  And he's going to avenge all of that.  Trust and believe you in me.  I'm pleased to get out of Boston to answer that. ",
