Speaking of crazy-ass white people.  No charcoal grills are allowed.  Oh, this is so delicious.

Get in the car.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  I don't think that ended up quite how they expected.  I'm pretty sure that was, I mean, when you get in your car with your clothes on and you get out your car with your clothes on, you expect to get back in your car with your clothes on.  I'm just saying.  They walked over like they were supposed to roll out the window and just keep it moving.  Come on, y'all ain't going to do nothing.  Y'all ain't going to do nothing.  That was, I mean, again, it was cool.  Again, they got the car.  Yeah, what y'all gonna do?  She's sitting here, and then she ends up halfway butt naked, shirt off, breasts all out, showing her bra.  And then, of course, the hub, say, man, no, it's cool.  No, no, no, no, it ain't cool.  Don't walk over here.  You got your ass out the car.  No, no, you cut us off.  Then you cussed us out yelling out the car.  Then you got out your car and walked over to our car.  Yeah, they were begging for that butt whooping.  They really did.  They begged for that one.  Got kids in the back recording it.  She on the phone at 9-1-1.  She on the car, and then if I was over, she like, well, we're caught.  We can go home.  Never mind.  Never mind.  We don't need y'all.  We don't need y'all.  They ain't got no weapons.  They ain't got no clothes.  They ain't got no clothes.  But all these folks, again, see, I keep warning.  I keep warning white people.  The wrong one.  I keep warning white people.  Yo, today, don't you roll up on some folks.  It ain't going to end well.  I don't know why these folks keep trying us.  I'm telling y'all, it's not going to end well.  You keep acting a fool, and then when you get knocked the hell out, you're going to be like Deebo.  Like on Friday, you're going to get knocked out.  You know, just jumping out the car and stuff along those lines.  I'm telling you, I just, I don't understand.  But the woman, the Latina was just waiting.  Oh, my God.  It was like Hulk smash.  She was just flinging that woman all over the place.  She thought about immigration and everything else.  She was like, oh, my God.  No good.  I'm tired of this.  She thought about Santa Ana, the Alamo.  So she was reaching all the way back in history.  All of them.  I'm just warning y'all.  Don't act a fool.  But wait, kudos to the kids.  They tried to stop it.  Mom, you're embarrassing me.  You know what I mean?  All right, we got it.  Exactly.  At this point, go sit down.  Let me do this here, y'all, before I go to my next story, okay, which is a serious story.  This is the third straight video.  Can y'all do me a favor?  Can y'all please learn how to shoot horizontal?  See, Henry, Henry, Henry, Henry, play the video again.  Play the video again.  Take the audio down.  I just need to show y'all something, okay?  Y'all, I need y'all to stop.  That's a vertical video.  Y'all see all that stuff on the left and right?  We gotta put on the screen to fill it up.  I need y'all to learn how to shoot your fight videos different.  You don't care about the other ones, but just the bike videos.  Right here, okay?  Go to my iPad.  Go to my iPad.  Can y'all, do you see this?  See, that was shot horizontal.  That was the robotics competition at Rainbow Push.  I shot some video about three years ago.  See, y'all, see how it fills the whole screen up?  Just do me a favor.  Great copy.  If y'all are shooting crazy-ass white people, please, I need you to shoot this way.  I need you to shoot horizontal.  Because, see, I want to get the whole ass whipping.  I want the whole ass whipping in the picture.  I can't get the whole as I can only get like portions of it when y'all shoot this way.  And so again, and let me show you, I got two phones.  See, you can even do it with two hands.  Okay.  This is how you even do it.  You got two.  Boom.  I'm shooting two.  It's like all the action, all the action going.  Then I can go high.  I can go.  That's all I'm saying.  So if y'all shoot these videos, OK, I need y'all to go.  And even when you go live, you go live on Instagram, Facebook, turn your phone, go horizontal.  OK, I know y'all think it's easier doing this way.  No, no, no, no.  But for television purposes, I need y'all to go ahead and shoot that thing horizontal so I can get the full picture of crazy white people getting their ass whooped on freeways.  That's all I'm saying.  I appreciate that.  All right, folks, back to that rollback unfiltered video in just one moment.  All right, folks, they're back.  MarijuanaStock.org has another great investment opportunity.  If you were lucky enough to invest in their last crowdfunding campaign, you know they raised a lot of money in just a few months investing in legal marijuana farms.  Those initial investors now own shares of a publicly traded company.  Last time, of course, again, a lot of you missed it.  Now you have a second opportunity for a new investment opportunity that is as good or if not better than the last time.  I'm talking about industrial hemp CBD.  Now for those who don't know, the hemp plant is the cousin to marijuana with a much higher concentration of CBD, which means hemp CBD gives you all of the medical benefits of marijuana without getting you high.  Until recently, hemp farming was practically illegal in the US and heavily regulated by the DEA.  But the 2018 Farm Bill signed into law makes it illegal to grow hemp CBD in the  U.S.,  creating one of the largest commodities worldwide.  They need land and to grow all of the plants.  This makes for an incredible investment opportunity.  And that's where our good friends at 420 Real Estate come in.  Their business model is simple.  They buy land that supports hemp CBD grow operations and lease it to licensed, high-paying tenants.  That's right.  They are hemp CBD landlords.  And you can get in on the action, folks.  You can invest in this crowdfunding campaign for as little as $200 up to $10,000.  Like I said, you don't want to miss out on this opportunity.  You should go to MarijuanaStock.org.  That's MarijuanaStock, M-A-R-I-J-U-A-N-A, Stock.org.  That's the website right there.  You can get in the game and get in the game now.  Back to your Roland Martin, I'm Bill DeFitts. ",
