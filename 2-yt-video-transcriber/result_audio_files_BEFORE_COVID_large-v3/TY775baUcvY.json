Of course, your party's been looking at doing a pact.  over about 60 different seats to repeat the success you had in the Brecon by-election, which, when the Leave vote was split between the Tories and a much smaller vote going to the Brexit Party, led to you winning that seat.

I obviously know the Labour Party quite well, haven't been a member of it for 20 years.  So these things can only work if you get buy-in from local parties where appropriate.  And, I mean, we've always been clear stopping Brexit is the number one priority.  It comes before absolutely everything else.  And so where it's appropriate to do these kinds of arrangements, we're open to considering it.  But as I said, the local party has a huge say in it.  But we've shown in Brecon and Radnorshire that sometimes where you do these things, it can work.  One thing I would just say, I mean, in terms of the Remain vote, I mean, in the end, the parties involved are parties that are committed to stopping Brexit.
