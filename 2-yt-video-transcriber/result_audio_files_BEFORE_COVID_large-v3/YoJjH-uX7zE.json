All right, I wanted to do this video over the last several days, but alas, Jeffrey Epstein had to go and get Hillary'd.  July's Nielsen ratings have come out for the cable news shows, and while they show Fox News continued dominance in the ratings, that wasn't newsworthy.  What's really newsworthy here is the dramatic fall, the collapse, the implosion, and the ratings for one Rachel Maddow.  That's right.  Rachel Maddow, the fledgling ultra left-wing network MSNBC, has fallen behind every major Fox News program coming in at an embarrassing fifth place.  Now, just to give you a sense of how far Maddow has fallen, back in March, which was at the end of Q1 for the year, Maddow actually was topping Sean Hannity's show on Fox with the coveted 25 to 54-year-old demographic, which is quite an achievement in that sense, in terms of advertisers.  Maddow was the queen of the nine o'clock hour.  She was beating Hannity with the 25 to 54-year-old viewers that advertisers covet so much.  So she was really on top of the cable news media, as it were, just literally a couple of months back.  But then... The Mueller report, the release of the Mueller report that Maddow was promising her audience would finally overturn the Trump presidency.  Once Bumbling Bob released his report that found absolutely no hint of collusion with Russia and the Trump campaign on the one hand or obstruction of justice on the other.  After Bumbling Bob's report was released, Maddow was staring at nothing less than the undoing of her own program.  I don't know how many of you remember, but the Bumble and Bob report was released.  And the day it happened, Maddow actually cried on air.  I mean, she cried.  It was like election night all over again.  And you had to think... That's at least part because she knew her ride was over.  I mean, the conspiracy theories that she was peddling night after night after night regarding the future release of the report was the only thing that was keeping her program on top.  She was the hope of leftist liberals everywhere who were finally going to see justice done to the most racist neo-Nazi white supremacist president ever.  And so when the report came out and it was a big nothing burger, we began to see the inevitable demise of her program.  According to Fox News, Maddow lost nearly 500,000 viewers her first episode following the release of the report.  Half a million of her viewers turned her off after Bumble and Bob ruined her nightly anti-Trump rants.  Then, according to the report by TV Newser, she plummeted 13% in viewership in April compared to the same month in 2018 in May.  She began losing her audience from precisely that 25 to 54-year-old demographic.  She went from 550,000 viewers between the ages of 25 and 54 in March to just over 400,000 in May.  And then the July figures came out and she dropped even more to just over 380,000.  I mean, just to put that in perspective, there are conservative YouTubers, okay, with a $100 webcam who are getting more views than than the multi-million dollar corporation MSNBC's number one show, okay?  Just to put it in perspective there.  And now she's fallen from first place all the way down to fifth.  She's trailing all four of Fox News' evening shows in terms of total viewership.  No, I think there are a couple of takeaways here.  First and foremost, I think this implosion in Maddow's ratings indicate that the lunatic left are absolutely demoralized, okay?  I think it helps explain just how psychotic they become.  They really thought the Mueller report was it, that it was going to be their golden ticket, right?  That restored their liberal left-wing dreams.  It was going to get rid, it was going to rid the nation of Trump and- bring us into a 2020 election season that would restore the leftism of Obama and all that.  They really believed, Rachel Maddow, that Trump's days were numbered and that Mueller would finally bring him down.  And so when it didn't happen, I think we saw a display of a real disillusionment among these leftists, these activists.  They walked away from their MSNBC champions.  And they're just licking their wounds at this point, realizing not only that the days of Trump are not numbered, he may indeed and is most likely will win reelection.  How's that for a realization, right?  So I think that's the first thing.  I think the collapse in Mado's ratings is an indicator of just how demoralized the left really is.  are at this point.  Second takeaway is I think this is a further indicator of really the demise of left-wing media in general.  Remember, networking cable news is really the only thing they have, okay?  They don't have talk radio, right?  They don't have YouTube, right?  Studies have shown conservatives dominate YouTube right now.  I mean, they have subpar websites like Washington Post and Salon.com and BuzzFeed and Twitter that just It's an echo chamber for left-wing bellyaching.  And while liberals do dominate these media platforms like Twitter and so forth, that domination has yet to translate into anything like what one media critic calls any real-world influence.  Twitter's basically a secular liberal echo chamber that preaches to the choir and throws out old, tired liberal euphemisms and trite little hashtags that die out as quickly as they arise.  Same goes for Huffington Post and the like.  By contrast, the right dominates cable news.  We dominate talk radio.  We dominate YouTube and Reddit and 4chan.  Media scholar Angela Nagel's study entitled Kill All Normies on How the Right Won the Online Culture Wars, she made the argument that left-wing social media has been completely incapable of thinking beyond what she calls the cult of suffering and the incessant practice of cry-bullying.  And in such a world where we have terms to describe crime's against sexual and racial and physical minorities such as misogyny and racism and sexism and ableism and all this crap.  In such a world, there's really no place for men and yes, particularly white men in this cry-bullying social justice warrior infested cyberspace.  And so not just men, but anyone who couldn't stand the stench of this leftist ideology, they flocked to the other side of cyberspace.  particularly the message board site 4chan and of course YouTube and then of course talk radio and Fox News.  And as a result, we've seen emerge a platform for a mass blowback against this liberal mentality.  And the backlash that's developed over the years is a radically anti-PC, anti-feminist, anti-social justice warrior culture that uses the very same shaming techniques of the left, right?  Things like race shaming, right?  People talking about white privilege or gender shaming, the constant pointing out to the glass ceiling for women, right?  Like we saw at Hillary's supposed victory gala that night on election night with her stupid glass roof.  This kind of shaming was effectively adopted and then turned on to the left by this new emerging right-wing biosphere.  And what people like Rachel Maddow are finding out, our conservative media world is growing and her left-wing media world, like her ratings, is collapsing.
