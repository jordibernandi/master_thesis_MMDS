So I thought this would make an interesting object lesson in how facts get distorted on the vlogosphere and how to fact check.  Let me start by saying that I like Academic Agent and not just because he uses the wonderful George Sanders as his icon.  He does repeat a lot of the nonsense about climate change found on the internet but he has shown a willingness in the past to listen when evidence contradicts his assumptions, so I'm sure he'll do the same here.  The question is about whether the Maldives are going to be inundated by rising sea levels. ",

The Mail doesn't even cite its source, but it does give a keyword and a date, so it's not hard to search Google Scholar for the word Roi Namur and find the relevant paper.  And it's quickly apparent that it doesn't say the Maldives will become uninhabitable by 2030 at all.  First of all, it was looking at the Marshall Islands, not the Maldives.  The study looks at two different issues.  The first is the issue of potable drinking water.  As sea levels rise, salt water is intruding into the fresh groundwater, making it increasingly salty.  The paper predicts that between 2030 and 2065, the groundwater in many atolls will be too salty to drink.  The range of dates reflects three different scenarios depending on how much action is taken to curb CO2 emissions.  2030 is the least likely date because it envisages no action at all on climate change.  The Mail gave the correct range predicted by the study, more or less, but typical of a tabloid newspaper, the Mail chose to put the least likely date in the headline, because it's the most dramatic.  And that's the date the academic agent picked up on. ",

But a bigger problem will be storm surges which flood the islands with salt water.  As sea levels rise, these will become annual events between 2055 and 2105.  The conclusion is that many atolls will remain suitable for human habitation until 2100 or 2150.  This isn't just in the body of the study, it's right there in the title.  but the Mail took this issue of uninhabitability, or human inhabitants as it calls it, and applied it to the earliest date for salty drinking water.  The study didn't look at the question of permanent inundation by rising sea levels, but it said that other studies had predicted this wouldn't happen until at least the end of this century.  The academic agent, however, not only said that the islands would be uninhabitable by 2030, he went on to claim they'd be completely submerged by 2030, something even the Mail Online didn't suggest.

The Daily Mail picks up bits of this to report that the Maldive Islands will be uninhabitable by 2030 to 2060, and a headline that says this is likely to happen in 2030.

The process was first postulated by Charles Darwin, and a number of papers have been published over the decades documenting the continuing growth of these islands.  Although research continues, there's as yet little evidence that the expected rate of sea level rise will reverse that.  In 2010, Arthur Webb and Paul Kench analyzed hundreds of historical aerial photographs and confirmed that 23 out of 27 Pacific atolls are indeed either stable or growing in size, including Tuvalu.  So why do climate scientists insist that these islands face problems?  Well, the problems are related to other issues caused by climate change, such as storm surges, coastal erosion and saline intrusion, not total submergence from rising seas. ",
