            "text": "In the words of the Messiah, if the blind lead the blind, then they'll both fall into a ditch.  Also, the words of the Messiah, many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many.  By now, as you can see, and as I can see, this August 20th prophecy that a lot of these Hebrews was pushing has been a total failure.  The chariots didn't come pick you up.  You're not in the wilderness.  Babylon didn't burn.  The prophecy was a total failure.  Like I've been telling people since two years ago that this whole 2019 hype was from the enemy to get brothers and sisters set up for disappointment.  And here people are stuck looking like a dodo bird.  After getting pumped up and hyped up by all these Negroes who don't know their left foot from their right foot and can barely tie their shoes or add one plus one equals two in scripture, they got everybody hyped up.  And here we are.  The day that they pumped up for so long has come and gone and nothing happened.  If the blind lead the blind, then they'll both fall into a ditch.  And a lot of folks fell into a ditch today, feeding into the hype, not studying the scriptures for themselves, feeding into videos, clicking on all these videos, feeding into the stuff folks is posting on social media.  If the blind lead the blind, they'll both fall into a ditch.  Just think about this for a moment, family.  The same individuals now that's saying that that this is it.  You know, the time is up.  Sentence served.  They're going to have to go right back to work tomorrow.  So whenever the boss says, hey, I need you to clean up, I need you to mop up that spill on aisle six.  Are these same Negroes that is putting all these messages online, getting everybody pumped up, what they going to say to that boss?  They going to say, hey, the 400 years is up.  I ain't mopping no floors no more.  Guess what the boss is going to say?  If you don't get your raggedy behind over there to aisle six and mop up that spill, you're going to be taking 400 steps up out of here.  So a lot of these same folks that saying it's it sitting served, you're going to see them drag day behind right to punch in tomorrow.  And there's nothing wrong with having a job.  At least they got the job.  But they're telling you online that the sentence is up.  It's over.  But they're going to drag day behind to work for the Gentile tomorrow.  But the sentence is up, though.  But that's it.  A lot of them, whenever you call them out on this false prophecy, what they're going to say is, man, we we weren't saying nothing was going to happen.  We just saying that the 400 years is up.  The sentence is served.  OK, let me tell you what that's like.  That's like somebody, a company telling you that you hire, they'll say, OK, your hire date is August 20th.  That's the day you're going to get hired.  And you're going to start working on August 20th.  And then you'll be like, OK, cool.  So I start on the 20th.  When's my first payday?  We don't know.  August 20th is just the beginning.  It's just the beginning date.  And that's what a lot of these Negroes are saying now.  Well, you see, August 20th, this is just the beginning of the most high free in us.  This is just the beginning.  You know, that's the same way of somebody saying your hire date is the 20th and you got to work.  But when you ask them when your payday is, they say, I don't know.  Just keep working.  Wait a minute, bro.  I got bills to pay.  You telling me that my hire date is on the 20th, but you ain't telling me when I'm gonna get paid, but you want me to work.  That's what these Negroes are doing whenever they drag you along.  By setting these dates, then nothing comes to pass.  Then they hit you with the old excuse of this is just the beginning.  The 20th is just the beginning of the phase.  You see, a lot of what these Negroes are doing is no different than the Christians that be setting dates for the rapture.  This is just the Hebrew version of that.  That's all it is.  They're just like the Christians setting all these false dates for the rapture.  That's the same with these Negroes in this 2019 thing.  And whenever you call them out on the blatant lies and falsehood, another thing they'll say is, man, we never said that the Messiah was going to come on this date.  We never said the Most High was going to come on this date.  But by constantly hyping up a specific date, by constantly hyping up a specific year, you're leading people to believe that something is going to happen.  So they try to throw a rock and hide their hand and act like they ain't been the ones hyping people up for all this time about 2019 and August 20th.  Now, when they see that nothing happened and they've been exposed for the false prophets that they are, they'll try to say we never said nothing was going to happen on the day.  We were just saying that, you know, it's 400 years.  They know good and hell well they've been hyping it up.  They know good and hell well.  they've been saying for all this time that this date and this year was going to be the time that we go into the wilderness, that Babylon falls, that the chariots is going to be coming to pick folks up.  Now they got their feelings hurt, looking like a doofus, looking like a goofball, looking like a dodo bird.  Like I said, they're throwing a rock and then hiding their hand.  In the legal system, don't you know that that's equivalent to conspiracy charges?  To where you're saying things that lead people to take a certain course of action and lead people to believe a certain thing.  And then if that person that you led to believe that goes off and does something dumb, then the blood that they spill... or the dumb thing that they do is on your hands because in a roundabout way, you pumped them up and hyped them up.  They call that conspiracy charges.  It means something you said or did has a role in a criminal act.  somebody else did.  So when these Negroes put these dates out there and the whole 2019 hype and all that, And you got people out here quitting jobs.  You got people out here leaving their families.  You got folks running off to Ghana and Kenya and all that based on what these Negroes are saying, putting these dates out there.  That's conspiracy charges.  That's a spiritual form of you leading somebody to do something stupid based off something you said.  And let me make a prophecy.  Since everybody's in a prophesying mood, here's my prophecy.  These Negroes ain't going to do nothing but keep changing the date.  Watch what I tell you.  Now that this whole August 20th thing didn't happen, you're going to see these Negroes doing the Millie Rock.  They're going to be like, you see what had happened, Ock, is, you know, on the Gregorian calendar, when you connect it to the Enoch calendar, it actually wasn't August 20th, it's actually September.  Yeah, it's September that it's all going to go down.  Just wait and see, Ock, just wait.  Well, Negro, if it was September, why was you pumping August 20th all this time?  So I guarantee you that prophecy I just made is going to come to pass.  These Negroes ain't going to do nothing but keep changing the date because they're false prophets.  They're the blind leading the blind.  And all they're doing is leading people into a ditch.  These same Negroes talking about this is it.  It's over.  They're going to drag their raggedy behind to work tomorrow.  And guess what?  September rent is still going to be due.  Negro, if the 400 years was up, your behind would have land.  You would have servants.  You would be in your own kingdom.  You wouldn't be running around here talking about you an American.  So guess what, Negro?  It didn't happen.  Admit that you were false profiting.  You've been following after the blind.  Admit that you're looking like a dodo bird right now.  Admit that you're looking like a goofball and a doofus right now for feeding into all these false prophets.  Just admit it.  That's the first step to repentance.  But I guarantee you, family, all they're going to do is keep changing the date.  But you know what?  The reason that people like this feel like they have free reign to make all these false prophecies is because they know that if we was in our land under our law, that the penalty is death for a false prophet.  Like it's cute to a lot of them now to get people hyped up about these dates and all that.  But if we was in the land of false prophet, false prophets, they would get lined up and get their brains blown out in front of all the other brothers and sisters so that the point could be made.  This is what happens to false prophets.  You you get people hyped up and make false prophecies around here.  You're going to get your brains blown out.  That's what would happen if we was in our land.  But it's cute now because they can do it because they feel like no judgment will come upon them.  And you still gonna have goofballs that still keep following all these false dates and false prophecies, even though time and time damn again, every time the prophecies tank.  I haven't seen these niggas be right about nothing.  I'm serious.  Pardon my Hebrew.  I haven't seen them be right about nothing, man.  Every prophecy that these Negroes make tanks.  So this August 20th thing is yet another example that they don't know what the hell they talking about.  So I'm not going to say much more on this because Negroes still going to be Negroes and follow after false prophets.  Even the scripture says only one out of seven thousand.  Father Abraham saw judgment day and only one out of 7,000 was making it in.  So I already know the message is not going to be very well received.  People still going to follow after false prophets and most are just vessels fit for destruction as the scripture says in 2nd Ezra.  It says let the many perish who were born in vain.  Harsh words but it's real.  So Brothers and sisters, just use this as yet another case study that a lot of folks out here talking about their Hebrew and their Israelite don't know what the hell they talking about. ",
