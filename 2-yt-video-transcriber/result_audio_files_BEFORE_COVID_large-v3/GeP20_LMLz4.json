            "text": "Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you are in the world.  And once again, we find ourselves at a crossroads.  I'm Paul Elam, and this is my good friend, Tom Golden from menaregood.com, and they certainly are.  We have come up with a new discussion that we're going to launch today.  And we're going to talk about what we're going to talk about for a few minutes here before we get started.  But what we've noticed, both of us, and both of us being men in long-term relationships and knowing that a lot of our audience is one way or another, they're either dating women or in relationships.  We know that a lot of guys are MGTOW and don't date, and some of them are completely monk lifestyle.  And that's certainly something that we honor and understand the reasons that people do that.  But I think the overwhelming evidence before us all is that red pill men, for the most part, are going to pair bond or want to pair bond or will at some point in the future.  So the question then becomes, you know, how... to operate within relationships with all this red pill knowledge you've got going on in your head, but you're going to be facing blue pill challenges.  And so Tom and I quickly came up with like 15 or 18 topics to do over the next several months.  And I'm sure that those discussions will breed other topics.  Now, that's the good news.  We've got this new discussion.  We think that a lot of men will be interested in it, even if we know that some men won't, and that's fine.  But the other side of this is that we're going from this, well, after this presentation of this discussion, this is going to become a patrons only and subscribe star only matter for Tom and I at a new Patreon that we'll be launching.  and a new Subscribestar account that we'll be launching.  We'll give you updates on that and Tom and I and Janice meet regularly and you'll be hearing updates on this when we go to the official launch and you'll be given links.  We want to both provide this, not just to the men who really want to see it, but as something special for people who actually kick into the tip jar and support our work.  that is greatly appreciated.  And I don't know about you, Tom, but I'm always left with the feeling that I haven't been providing enough just to the people that are supporting what we do.  And so we're going to offer that to them.  Like I said, the announcements on when it'll officially start will come in the near future.  But every other episode that we do of this, henceforth, are going to be for patron and subscribe star only.  Now the good news about that is that it's not an expensive affair.  You will be able to, say on the Patreon, you'll be able to subscribe for $1 per video and cap it at one video per month.  So your cost for, we plan on doing it weekly, your cost for doing this will be $1 a month.  Same thing on Subscribestar, which is a monthly subscription.  They don't have per video choices on Subscribestar.  But we're also there, and we encourage you to go there to our shared account, which we will be providing to support it there.  And that is pretty much in a nutshell what we're going to be doing.  Is there anything you wanted to add to that, Tom? ",

            "text": "That is, I mean, that's a discussion all in its own, Tom, because what we know about this culture is that men are left to sort of twist in the wind.  Yeah.  comes to relationships your fathers generally do not mentor them into holding their own.  in relationships men are taught how to please women and what they must do.  you must open the door.  you must pay for things.  you know this is how you treat a woman.  you don't talk that way to them.  here's all the things you need to do in order to have women's approval.  you know men are pretty good about teaching their sons that sort of thing.  uh which and i use the word pretty good loosely um But what we end up with is a bunch of gynocentrism.  Men, being gynocentric for the most part, don't teach their sons to not be gynocentric.  And wisdom tells us and experience tells us that we need mentorship out there for men of all ages about how they operate with women.  And one of the first things that popped up in my mind on the benefit of this, Tom, is that I've heard from men regularly over the years that they feel defenseless with women.  Sometimes you have to dig to get a guy to admit this.  But if you can connect with him enough, most men, or a lot of them anyway, will eventually tell you that when she pins me down and tells me what was said and when and what I did wrong, I don't even feel like I know what to say to defend myself.  So, and what most men do is they end up going, okay, you know, whatever, or they get mad and say, you're a fucking bitch or something like that, or something destructive on the other side of the reaction, but they don't know how to connect with her and hold their own and turn that conversation around from being defensive to them being in standing their own ground.  And to me, and again, this is one of the things we don't teach men this.  As a matter of fact, we teach men if they do that, that they hate women and they're wrong.  That's it. ",

And guys are really in a tough spot today because women are taught to be inflated.  They're taught to be inflated and they're taught that they didn't get what they deserved.  And this is a huge, huge problem for relationships.  You can't go into a relationship with someone when they think that kind of thing.  It just doesn't work.  And one of the things we'll be talking about is when do you get out?  When do you know that you need to get the hell out of this mess?  We'll be talking about that and lots of other stuff. ",

When to get out, how to get out, why you should get out, why it's okay to get out, and why that.  sometimes you need to get out, even though everything in you is screaming at you to stay.  Because here's the problem.  This is one of the dirty little secrets about men in relationships that we never talk about, is that there are millions and millions and millions of men that live with constant abuse.  Constant sexual manipulation, constant emotional abuse, constant, you never do this for me, you never do that.  These forms of emotional and sexual blackmail that have become normal in our society, and that's one thing we're going to be talking about a lot.  What is normal for so many women, especially in this day and age, is abuse.  their tack in relationships is abusive, and they think they're being normal.  They even think they're being healthy because the mental health establishment has preached to them, oh, you go, girl, you go.  Yes, be abusive.  And that's exactly what they're taught.  And so men are taught this too.  They're being told, hey, well, you know, she's just, she's being truthful. ",

Part of it will be teaching men to teach women.  the difference between hostility.

And then you see her women sitting in air conditioned offices, you know, the 21st century playing with their iPhone and talking about how oppressed they are.  And no, no, the guy in the coal mine doesn't count.  The truck driver doesn't count.  Right.  Um, Part of this, and part of the problem, and we're going to address it over and over again, is that the saying that a movement is the radical notion that one sex is human beings, that really applies to men more than women.  We've always treated women like they were human beings.  We treat men like they're human doings.  Women are treated like they're human beings.  There's never been a time in history where they weren't protected.  at the cost of life and limb and blood by men.  And it's men that's been on the other side of that.  And it's not that we want to portray men as victims.  That's the last thing that will happen.  But we will be stressing the idea, the importance of men accepting that they're human beings.  Yes.
