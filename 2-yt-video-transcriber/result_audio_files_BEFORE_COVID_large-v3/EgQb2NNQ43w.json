            "text": "the son of immigrants who came here seeking the American dream, Andrew Yang.  His parents taught him about hope and hard work, a leader in education.  Andrew Yang, the founder of Venture for America, a nonprofit that helped create thousands of jobs.  President Obama named Andrew a champion of change, and his ideas are a blueprint for a new way forward, an economy where big tech and Wall Street are held accountable.  A healthcare system with Medicare for all that takes on drug companies to lower prices.  A fight against climate change that confronts big polluters.  We have to rewrite the rules of the 21st century so that they work for us.  Andrew Yang.  Parent, patriot, not a politician.  A new leader who understands that what's coming is the greatest economic transformation in history and who can lead us in the fight for the future that we want.  For President Andrew Yang, a new way forward. ",
