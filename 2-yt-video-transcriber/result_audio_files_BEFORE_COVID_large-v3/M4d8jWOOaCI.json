My name is Meghan McCain and I'm on a news show called The View.  And Donald Trump, that fucking riverboat casino captain, is talking shit about my father again.  My father was tortured for a hundred years for this fucking country.  And he came back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman.  Fuck you, Trump.  I'm going to wear my father's skin mask and I'm going to primary Trump from the right.  Come on the view, bitch.  If you're that tough, come on the view.  You want an Alessandro Casio Cortez?  You want this shit?  You want to fuck these tits, Trump?  You want to fuck these tits?  No, you don't.  You want to suck cock.  But I won't fuck you because the only person I'll fuck is daddy.  I'll fuck his corpse.  I'll fuck daddy's corpse. ",
