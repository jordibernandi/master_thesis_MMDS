            "text": "Hey, y'all.  How's everybody doing?  Doing good, I hope, after I look around.  Cold weather's coming to an end.  March Madness is in full swing.  The sun is shining.  The birds are singing.  Hope is alive.  Justice is a facade.  Springtime has come to America.  No, look, I know, I know it's rough, all this shit with the Mueller report.  It's made doubly rough by having to watch the other side gloat about it.  These motherfuckers are dancing in the streets, man.  Or at least they would be if any of them could dance and weren't completely terrified of the streets.  Yeah, it's a tough pill to swallow, I know, but it's the same pill that's been shoved down the throats of poor people and minorities in this country since the motherfuckers started, so I can't say I'm altogether very surprised.  You know, for the past couple years we've been watching all these stories trickle out, one after another, about all this seemingly incriminating shit about the president and Russia and everything, and I know I, and I'm sure a lot of y'all, Was watching all that happen.  the same way I watch most of the seasons of The Walking Dead.  Well, this sure seems bad, but when is something gonna happen?  And of course it didn't amount to shit.  It was never gonna amount to shit.  Baldly unethical rich white man gets away with it all.  More at 11.  It's just how it fucking works, man.  But look, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying we should just be all right with it.  I'm just saying we should focus on the only thing that we can do about any of it.  My mama always said, baby, the law ain't gonna do shit for you.  You're gonna have to do it yourself.  2020 is the only play, and it always has been.  And look, not for nothing, don't tell them, but we're laying the groundwork here.  Took the house back.  We've got a strong field of candidates shaping up right now.  Things are trending in the right direction.  And this fucking report doesn't change none of that.  All right?  So all I'm saying is, eyes on the prize, comrades.  Just let them keep patting themselves on the back in their golf courses and wiener massage parlors and convincing themselves that they've already won when we know that the battle's just getting fucking started.
