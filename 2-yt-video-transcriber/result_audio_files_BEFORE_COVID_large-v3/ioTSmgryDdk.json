            "text": "Hello friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor here.  We want to welcome you to our Friday evening Bible Question of the Week.  And our question today is one that sometimes has generated a lot of discussion.  Is it possible for a non-Christian to be saved?  If there are people in foreign countries who have never heard about Jesus or heard about the Gospel or Jehovah or the Bible, can they be saved?  Because there are certain verses in the Bible that might lead a person to think otherwise.  For example, Acts 4, verse 12.  Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.  People are only saved through the name of Jesus, it could sound.  And then you read where Jesus said in John 14, verse 6.  He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.  No man comes to the Father except by me.  So people read these verses and they think, is this the only way for people to be saved?  So that begs a question.  You've got thousands of years where you've got millions of people who live in South America, Australia, Africa, and the North American aborigines who maybe had never heard the name of Jesus before.  Were all of those people, all through those years, all doomed to be lost and go to the lake of fire because no missionary had ever come to talk to them about Jesus?  Well, I would respectfully say, no, we can't stretch things that way.  Now, there are some verses, for example, you read in 1 Timothy 2, verse 3, For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who will have all men to be saved.  Of course, not all will be saved.  He would like them all to be saved.  And to come to the knowledge of the truth.  For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ.  So first I want to establish if there is anybody saved, they can only be saved by Jesus.  There may be some who will be saved, well, I don't just think may, I'm quite certain there'll be some who will be saved, who maybe never had a missionary show up on their shores.  Really what you're doing is you're asking the question, Can God reach people without human instrumentalities?  Is God limited?  He can say, I can't reach the whole continent because I have no missionaries there yet.  Or can God speak to them through dreams and visions and angels and nature and circumstance?  I think so.  In fact, Jesus, when he began his ministry, he shocked the people in his hometown church when he stood up, and I'll quote to you what he said in his sermon from the Gospel of Luke chapter 4, 24, Luke 4, 24.  Jesus said, Jesus is saying the only widow who saw the miracle of Elijah during that famine was a Gentile.  And then Jesus said, there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.  And they became so angry, they took Jesus out of the synagogue, wanted to throw him off the cliff.  How dare you say that God could save somebody who's not an Israelite or outside of Israel?  But the Lord tells us that he has people all over that he knows and he loves.  You can read in Romans 1.20, Paul establishes this, \"'For the invisible things of him, of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power in Godhead, so that they are without  excuse.'\".  Nobody who is lost is really without excuse because the evidence for God is in the things that God made.  Now, God might speak through a preacher or a missionary or the Bible, but God can also speak through providence, through angels, through dreams, through visions, and through nature.  And there are people who are sincere people seeking truth around the world who are walking in the light that God has given them.  that may be in the kingdom, they'll be there by the grace of God, but they didn't hear a missionary they didn't know about the bible.  you can also read here in acts chapter 10. this is a good verse.  acts 10 verse 34 and 35. then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth.  i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is accepted by him.  if somebody is walking in the light that they have And God promises in Jeremiah chapter 29, verses 11 through 13, you will search for me and you'll find me when you search for me with all your heart.  That promise is not limited to the ancient countries that had the scriptures.  There were people in foreign lands that were searching for God.  And you've got the wise men who were seeking after God and he revealed himself to them and they came from Mesopotamia at the birth of Jesus.  In John chapter five, verse 28, Christ said, Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and come forth.  They that have done good, the resurrection of life.  They that have done evil, the resurrection of damnation.  Now, we're not saved on whether we did good or evil.  But if we do good or evil is evidence of whether we are seeking after God.  And there'll be people maybe who lived up to the light that they had.  You know, there's that parable that Jesus shares in Matthew chapter 25, and you can start with verse 31.  But in essence, you remember where it tells us, the king will say to those on his right hand, come you blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.  For I was hungry and you gave me food.  I was thirsty, you gave me drink.  I was a stranger and you took me in.  I was naked and you clothed me.  I was sick and you visited me.  I was in prison and you came to me.  Then the righteous will answer and say, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink?  When did we see you a stranger and take you in or naked and clothe you?  Or when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?  And the king will answer and say to them, surely I say in as much as you've done it to one of the least of these, my brethren, you did it to me.  You notice it says nothing in there about because you had your names on my church books.  The criteria in this Great Judgment Day that separates the sheep from the goats is do you love your neighbor?  Do you feed the hungry?  Do you clothe the naked?  Do you give water to the thirsty?  Do you visit those who are in prison?  Has the Spirit of God put the love of God in your heart for His creation?  And so there are people all around the world who are good.  They've listened to the Spirit speak to them.  Maybe God communicated to them not just through the Spirit, but through dreams and angels and visions.  And they've sought for what is good.  God's spoken to them through the things that He made.  And so we can't limit the Lord and say everybody in Australia for thousands of years until the first missionaries came are all going to the lake of fire.  I think that also just flies in the face of the very fairness and justice of God.  God judges people based on what they do with the evidence they've received.  To whom much is given, let me read these verses to you.  Luke chapter 12, verse 48.  For to everyone to whom much is given from him, much will be required.  To whom has been given more committed of him, they will ask the more.  So if a person's had little light, God only expects them to walk in the little light that they have.  You can read in John chapter 9, verse 41.  Jesus said to the religious leaders, if you were blind, you'd have no sin.  But now you say, we see, therefore your sin remains.  See, sin is knowing to do good and not doing it.  The Bible tells us people are destroyed in Hosea chapter 4 because they have rejected knowledge, not because they didn't know, but because they had a chance to know and they rejected knowledge.  And you can read in Hebrews 10, verse 26, if we continue to sin willfully after we've received a knowledge of the truth.  If they've got no knowledge of the truth, we're judged on the truth we have.  That's why there will be people in heaven that had multiple wives.  They didn't know.  And so the Bible tells us, you can read in Acts 17, verse 30, at the times of this ignorance, God winked at.  But now, once they know the truth, he commands men everywhere to repent.  There'll be people in heaven that went to church on the wrong day.  They ate pork and they had slaves.  They didn't know, but they lived up to the light that they had.  So this is a very important principle.  You can read in Acts 17, verse 26 and 27, And he has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on the face of the earth, and has determined their pre-appointed times and their boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord in the hope they might grope for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.  Paul said to the pagans, God is not far from anybody if we seek the Lord.  He's pre-appointed all the nations of the world that they should seek after God.  Israel was special in that he committed to them the oracles of the truth.  They had great light, great privilege, great blessings, great responsibility as a result of that.  You know, there's also some statements you can find, and different Christian theologians have made some great statements on this.  One I love is from the book Desire of Ages, where the author there said, Even among the heathen are those who have cherished the spirit of kindness before the words of life have fallen on their ears.  They've not heard the gospel.  They befriended missionaries, even ministering to them at the peril of their own lives, like Rahab did.  Among the heathen are those who worship God ignorantly.  They don't know, but they're worshiping God to the best of their ability.  Those to whom the light is never brought by human instrumentality, perhaps angels or the Spirit.  Yet they will not perish.  Though ignorant of the written law of God, they've heard his voice speaking to them in nature, and they've done the things that the law required.  Their works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they are recognized as the children of God.  That, I think, is a pretty powerful statement.  Now, someone's going to ask, well, Brother Doug, if you think that there are going to be people that can be saved and there's no missionary that goes to them and they don't have a Bible, then why bother sending missionaries?  Just let God send angels and dreams and his spirit to them.  Well, these people are the exception.  There are multitudes that are going to perish for lack of the truth.  And that's why God gives us the great blessing of going.  And that's the other reason.  Jesus commands us.  He says, go and teach to all nations.  With the gospel comes great light, great liberty, great blessing and responsibility.  So, of course, missionaries should go because many more will be saved because we are sharing the truth.  Those who God, in His grace, intercedes with in a miraculous way, they are the rare exception.  The principal responsibility for sharing the gospel, Christ is committed to people.  And so, can a non-Christian be saved?  Yes, all things are possible with God.  but primarily he wants to do it through you and me.  Hey, I have a book I want to share with you just to reiterate what the steps of the gospel are.  It's free.  I hope you'll click on the link below and ask for the classic by Joe Cruz called Three Steps to Heaven.  Even if you're a Christian, you'll be blessed by reading this again.  And if you like these weekly Bible questions, really appreciate if you click like there on the YouTube link.  And I don't know where it is.  It's here or here.  You look on your screen, you'll see where it is.  And even by doing that, you help other people hear these things that can save their lives.  Thank you.  God bless. ",
