            "text": "All right, I'm gonna be dropping some truth here about female nature on this.  Some of you guys might not want to hear it, but you need to hear it.  So this question here is one that I think will be one that many guys that are out there dating right now might run into at some point.  And so he said, I've been seeing a girl I met on Tinder for about two months.  As far as I'm aware, we are exclusive.  Neither of us are the type to see multiple people at once anyway.  I've been on Tinder again a couple times over the past few weeks just because I was bored and I got a notification and wanted to look at some of my old matches.  Not to chat or match with anyone.  I've been on her profile and the pictures have been updated in the past couple of weeks.  I'm kind of upset about it.  Do girls usually still update Tinder after they've been seeing a guy for a while?  It seems like you would only do that if you wanted matches.  I felt like things were going really well and she claims she really likes me, but now I can't help but feel a bit down.  I don't know whether to confront her or not.  Okay, so let's go over this.  To start here, something you mentioned in the very beginning of this, I'm going to drop some truth about this here, is when you said, I've been seeing a girl I met on Tinder for about two months.  As far as I'm aware, we are exclusive.  In parentheses, neither of us are the type to see multiple people at once anyway.  Okay.  That first part was one of the first wake-up calls I had to learn when... dating women.  Okay.  Is it when you are dating women?  and this was, this was something I found out about a decade ago and it's even more true now.  It's even more true now than it was 10 years ago, but 10 years ago before every woman was on online dating and social media and all of that stuff.  before all that, uh, I had to learn that when you are hanging out with a girl, women and men don't play by the same natural rules.  Because women will, just like we talk about with hypergamy, monkey branch, and all that, a woman's going to keep her options open.  So when you say, as far as I'm aware, we are exclusive, that is exactly how women want men to think.  Women want to make the man that she's seeing assume that they're exclusive because then you're going to give all your time and attention and affection to her while she can still play the field and do whatever she wants.  If you ever make her upset or any of that stuff, she has other guys that she can then go hang out with.  So the first big rule to understand when you're dating women is that never assume exclusivity.  Never assume it until it is brought up and pinpointed and all of that stuff.  And you guys are officially boyfriend, girlfriend or whatever.  So that is the first rule.  Just always assume women are going to leave it open in event.  Even to the point of like she might tell when she might.  even when you're around her, she might walk around and really try to make it known like, oh, yeah, I'm not my eyes are on no one else.  Again, that's women.  They're smart about this.  That's part of their way that they can kind of lull you to sleep into thinking like you kind of said here that you as far as you're aware, you guys are exclusive.  Women, again, will do that chameleon act to where whenever you're around them, She's going to try to make it seem like you guys are exclusive to make you happy, to kind of lull you to sleep so that then you're all hers, but she also has other men in her rotation, in her orbit.  Does that mean she's sleeping with them?  No, it doesn't.  But does that mean that she has multiple guys in her phone that she's probably extra flirty with?  Yeah, probably.  Now let's go to your next part.  I've been on Tinder a couple times over the past few weeks just because I was bored and I got a notification and wanted to look at some of my old matches.  Not to chat or match with anyone.  I've been on her profile and the pictures have been updated in the past couple of weeks.  I'm kind of upset about it.  Okay, well. ",
