            "text": "Hello.  Just a quick word of thank you to everyone for your well wishes during my tussle with influenza.  I'm feeling much better now.  Thank you.  My book on how I beat infertility is at the four matters.  It should be available for sale very soon, but it is available free to my Patreon patrons right now.  Early reviews are very kind, and thank you for that.  i hope this book helps some babies to be born who would not otherwise be born today.  in honor of babies i would like to begin an installment of short stories vaguely connected by the smallness of their subjects.  i call these small comforts.  i was a frightened man.  my wife was well along in an ultra high risk pregnancy.  After our first baby was born, postpartum complications almost killed my wife.  I saw everything.  That story is in my book.  You must never make your wife pregnant again, the doctor told me.  Never ever.  You will kill her.  I understood, and I promised that it would never happen again.  And it should have never happened again.  But it did.  We knew the danger to my wife, and we also knew the dangers to the baby.  This is too super high risk for me.  I cannot be your doctor.  You will have to do the whole thing at the big city hospital.  Good luck.  My wife had to stay in bed a lot.  Had to stay in the hospital sometimes, too.  It brought Matilda and me very close together.  The big city doctor was nice, always cheerful, always encouraging.  I didn't trust him for a minute.  I had watched my wife slip away.  I knew the extent of the damage.  I clung hard to my fear and worry.  They monitored the baby very carefully and often.  On this day we saw her in profile, sucking on her thumb.  She was so beautiful and so frail, so close to life and so close to death.  I loved her and was utterly powerless to help her or protect her.  I was thinking these things and then Florentina turned and faced the camera and gave a thumbs up.  Everyone looked at me.  Everyone knew this message was for me.  Haha, you see that?  She says, I'm okay, Daddy, I'm okay in here.  She doesn't want you to worry anymore.  Well, I stopped worrying.  In the end, we almost lost Florentina and my wife, but we didn't.  They both squeaked through.  That thumbs-up from the womb... It was a small but wonderful comfort that I will never forget.  Okay, Daddy. ",
