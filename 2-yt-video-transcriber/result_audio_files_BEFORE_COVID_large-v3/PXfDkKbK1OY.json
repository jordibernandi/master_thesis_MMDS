And this is the kind of thing that Trump touches with all his bigoted topspin.  But the fact that the left can't acknowledge that there's a kernel of truth in his utterances here is a problem.  And that is just the disproportionate amount of violence in the black community upon the black community, right?  So black on black violence is still terrible in the U.S.  and accounts for, largely accounts for our outlier status with respect to homicides.  But the thing gets, is especially invidious when you just look at the percentages of the population because when you're talking about black on black crime or black on white crime, you're talking about, you know, mostly black men, right?  It's not black women committing most of these murders.  So you're talking about 6% of the population or thereabouts, right?  6% of the population commits something like 50% of the murders, right?  Now that sentence, uttering this sentence could get me canceled, but for the, the Preparations I've made within my own life to not be cancelable, right?  This is just a fact however, but it's a fact that only African Americans can speak about without being destroyed and that so this is absolutely a time.  and so what what white Democratic candidate for the presidency will speak honestly about this fact.  it is the kind of thing that gets you immediately compared to a Richard Spencer or some lunatic neo-Nazi.
