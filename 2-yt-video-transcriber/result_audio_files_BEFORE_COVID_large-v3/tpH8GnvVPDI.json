            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news to share with you today on Chivalous Volcano, Sunday, August 25th, 3 p.m Mountain Time, 2019.  Reports coming out, Chivalous Volcano erupting to 70,000 feet into the stratosphere, especially up at this northern latitude.  This is a huge stratospheric injection.  We're talking Plinian, Ultra Plinian, one of the largest eruptions in the last decade.  Explosive activity continuing according to the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center.  Anchorage warned about a volcanic ash plume that rose an estimated 70,000 feet.  That's 2,130 meters in altitude to a flight level 700 and is moving 10 knots north-northeast.  The good news is Chivalous is in the middle of nowhere.  Here's a current shot.  You can see that there is complete blocking out of the sun in this region.  Here is the material above.  Chivalry has been quite active over the last decade and over the last hundred years.  You can see the log radiative power, a real increase in January 2019.  And then we have this black uptick here last month.  Nothing substantial here.  This is not really giving us up-to-date information.  Let's go check what they have to say here.  Aviation code color currently red.  There's very little information.  Come over and make a donation over here at Volcano Discovery because they're the first people on top of this.  That's the best current photo I can get coming from Kavert.  Now, let's talk about Plinian and the VEI index.  We have a significant stratospheric injection happening, which makes it VEI5 or substantial.  In my opinion, it's significant to substantial, which puts it on the VEI56 cusp.  And the plume is 10 to 20 kilometers in the VEI 5.6 cusp.  So you want to learn about Plinian and Ultraplinian, come check it out.  Pliny's description, it's a Vesuvian eruption that comes straight up and fills the stratosphere, which is exactly what we're going to see in the pictures I'm about to show you.  Now, here it is again, Chivalous Volcano erupting to 70,000 feet.  The last major eruption was December 30th back in 2018.  Right at the New Year, where it erupted again at VEI 5.  So this one is VEI 5.6.  Here's Chevaluche, and I want to show you the debris field here and the scale.  This is 33 kilometers, and you can see this brown material.  I don't even know what it's doing.  It's this massive Nuit Ardent that came down 20 kilometers.  This is hot liquids that have run down here.  Massive eruption in the scale of tens of kilometers from the pictures we're getting.  There'll be more info as time progresses, but I just wanted to bring your attention to a major VEI 5.6 eruption coming from Chevalouche just within the last 24 hours.  This baby is not over, and there is the current picture.  You can see the sun is being blocked up here in the Kamchatka Peninsula.  I'll leave you links to the updates.  and the eruption stats.  Here we have the current data from the log radius of power at Chevaluche all the way up through the present.  No significant uptick.  There was actually a waning, a quiescence of this volcano over the last few months since that initial uptick and that eruption that we saw back in December.  So a larger eruption with lower activity currently happening.  We did recently have a period of KP0, a lot of cosmic rays coming in over the last few days, which is definitely responsible For kicking this baby off.  Volcanic Ash Advisory.  First there was 23,000 feet.  And then the 70,000 foot boomer.  Kicking off just hours ago.  Check it out guys.  Boom!  Into the stratosphere.  Chevalouche erupting into the stratosphere.  70,000 feet.  Share this with like-minded people.  Subscribe to the channel and be safe.  We love you. ",
