Because why do I need you?  I don't need you.  I didn't call for the police.  Okay.  So why do I need you?  I'm just curious, what are you looking for?  So that's not my problem.  I apologize to you again.  Okay, turn around.  Yep.  You are going to be arrested for... Yes, ma'am.  I apologize.  I'll be arrested.  Where are your keys?  Because your vehicle is going to be towed.  Alright, I'm going to get it.  I hope you appreciate what you're doing right now.  I do.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  All you have to do is give me your name.  That's all you have to do.  No, the first time when I asked you, the first, like I said, the first time when I asked you for your name, you said no.  So that's, okay, cool.  That's fine for you.  Look, it hurts me more for you to tell my mom and all that.  He's going to search you.  Yep.  She's arresting me for not identifying myself.  No, sir.

Well, your car is going to be towed, so I have to do an inventory.  Yes, ma'am, Ms.  Blair.  Stand for a thing.  Yes, ma'am, Ms.  Glenn.  I promise you.  I have nothing in my shoes.  I've done nothing illegal.  And what I'm doing is being arrested for identifying myself.  Yes, you are.  I'm identifying myself.  Secure with one. ",
