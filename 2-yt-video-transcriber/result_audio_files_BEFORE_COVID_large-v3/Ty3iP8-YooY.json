She is lauded by conservative news outlets as an unlikely ally in the fight against progressive tyranny, championed by individuals such as Jordan Peterson, and promoted by the intellectual dark web.  There is, however, something that all of them fail to mention about Camille Paglia.  She is pro-pedophilia and has for decades advocated for the legalization of both pedophilia and child pornography.  Her 1991 book, Sexual Personae, is even quoted on the official North American Man-Boy Love Association website, nambla.org.  where she asserts that pedophilia is both rational and honorable, encompassing what she says is a beauty that Christian morality fails to recognize.  This is not some kind of misunderstanding.  Paglia has repeatedly gone on record, stating that she thinks child pornography and pedophilia should both be legalized.  In 1994, she published another book entitled Vamps and Tramps, in which she described looking at child pornography and concluding that she sees nothing wrong with it.  The only potential obstacle she perceived with regard to legalizing child pornography were existing laws relating to child labour. ",
