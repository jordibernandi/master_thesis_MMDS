That's the people that want to take our guns, guys.  We want to take your guns, guys.  Hey guys, if they've asked to not be videoed, please don't undo this clause.  Who are you?  Huh?  Who are you?  Who said that?  Some of these women have asked already not to be videoed.  There's no assumption of privacy in public, ma'am.  But what I'm saying, what I'm saying, I know.  Okay.  I don't want to undo everything we've done with you today.  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying, yeah, keep it civil.  We are civil.  If they start having a problem, it's not good.  Yeah, I know.  I'm just asking you because we put a lot of work into this.  And we don't want it undone.  Trust me, we put a lot of work, too.  Huh?  We put in a lot of work, too.  I know.  But at the end of the day, if something gets crazy, this is what they'll show and not the 3,000 people we have here.  Why would they show this?  Because that's how it works.  How does it work, ma'am?  How does it work?  If they end up on the media with their videos, those will be played over our videos.  What's wrong with my video right now?  Nothing to you.  She's the one running this.  You're barking up the wrong tree here.  She's the one running all this.  Yeah.  Well, we're all running over this.  We're all running out of money.  I donate to her all the time.  She takes the money.  That's fine.  That's fine.  But people don't tell us what to do, bro.  We're free.  No, no.  I'm just video recording.  This is what I do, bro.  And they were like bullying me around.  Who was bullying you?  So I got his name.  What?  He looked like a top guy or like second down.  I don't know who he is.  He comes right up to me and he's like, he bumps into me and he puts his hand on my phone.  And I was like, don't touch me, don't touch my property.  And because I refuse to go off the side, there's nobody in there.  I don't have to move.  Okay, listen to your review.  They will.  I mean, they'll pay $5.75.  Oh, okay.  So I think now you'll be here.  Yeah, well, I'm going to have to navigate out of the water.  Hey, hey, hey, buddy, come here.  What's up?  Do you want me to sign a release?  What's up?  Do you want me to sign a release?  No.  I don't know what that is, but you can do whatever you want.  Well, turn your camera off because we don't want to be filmed.  Well, there's no assumption of privacy in public.  We're in a public place.  All right, I will get the police.  So, you don't tell me what to do, ma'am.  Hey, let me tell you something.  Maybe you should spend your time reading the Constitution a little bit more instead of trying to take our guns.  And mind your own business.  I'm in public.  Can you stop them from filming us?  Can you stop them from filming us?  Nah, he can film in a public place, ma'am.  And the reason that he's filming?  The reason is because we're in America and we're in a free country.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Please, don't touch me.  It's a public place.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can just walk away, that's all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can just walk away, that's all.  All right.  Guess what?  I don't like your booth, so I'm going to record it all day.  All right, that's fine, that's fine.  Enrique, let's, you know, carry on the conversation.  You know, she's upset.  You try to talk to her.  I'll talk to her, and that's it.  Some people find that offensive.  You know what I mean?  They don't know.  They know it's your right to record.  So I would just be patient with them.  No problem.  No problem.  You're a good guy, man.  It's your First Amendment right.  It's my First Amendment right, okay?  Thank you very much.  They don't like the First Amendment.  They don't like the Second Amendment.  What are we going to do?  How about sons demand action?  It's not their right to call the police on me.  But they don't have the right to... But they don't have... Unfortunately, they might not be informed.  That's what we call the walk of shame.  You don't call the police on people for doing absolutely nothing wrong.  I'm working on a story.  I'm not pushing.  I'm working on a story.  They can't stop me from doing that.  This is my job.  Thank you.  I feel bad for what they want to do and their purpose here.  You know, blame the criminals.  Blame the people who have guns.  The guns are in the wrong hands.  Blame them.  Don't blame us.  Don't blame me.  Were you against everything across the board on that?  Absolutely.  All right, good.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We might be a rare breed here, because there's a few, uh, small luxury that really vote for a few of those things.  It's always a little more built.  They're gonna allow it.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  The guns will be hot before, uh, they take them.  That's right.  That's right.  I totally agree with that.  I am breaking the law.  That's my YouTube channel, Breaking the Law.  We got bought in America.  I hope you can try it.  Can you tell me what channel you guys are on?  You have a channel, sir?  There you go.  You'll get a better picture like that.  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever shot a gun?  This might be your first time shooting with a camera.  Have you ever shot with a gun?  Would you shoot it and understand its responsibility and the effect it can cause?  That's part of the understanding.  I think you should try it.  Okay.  You guys, I'm giving you... Okay.  It gets to a point.  We're both here to exercise our constitutional rights, okay?  Sometimes it becomes a part of the family.  that's absolutely childish on both sides.  I mean, defeat your purpose.  Well, I'm letting him know how I feel by filming him.  If he doesn't like it, he can go home.  We don't need him here.  Do we need him here?  We don't, right?  If it was for you?  We'll need a license to exercise our First Amendment, right?  Are you going to want to tax our First Amendment rights too?  Just say what you want to say.  I'm not here to give you a hard time.  What's up?  No, we can stay right here.  You see what I'm saying?  No, I'm here to prove a point.  You're good.  Like you need more people to tell you that?  There you go, guys.  Freedom of speech is the best thing in the world.  Freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly.  You can do whatever you want in America.  Ain't that right, officer?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, 33.  I'm sorry?  We have history, don't we?  We sure do.  But, you know, we all learn from our mistakes.  No, you're very nice.  No, you're very nice.  I'm talking about the guy behind you.  I'm just kidding, number six.  How are you today?  We all learn.  We all learn.  Look, man, you should really think about what you're doing right now.  Maybe you have a reason, but hey, this is America.  We're free.  We have rights.  Why are you trying to get, you know, guns taken away?  You want only him to have the guns, right?  Only him.  That's not how it works.  And now?  How else do we lobby our government?  No, I agree.  If the door's open, it's open to the public, if there's a perception it's open to the public, fine, go in.  You're welcome to go in.  I agree 100%.  However, if someone comes to you and says, hey, we're having a private meeting, excuse me, you know, and then they show a little respect.  Right, yeah.  Because sometimes they do use those offices for private meetings.  Right, they secure it to make it private.  Right, that's fair, that's fair.  But they don't put a sign up here on the name.  But there's no sign up now.  No sign up.  And if the door's unlocked, they should be able to walk right in.  Yeah.  All right, yup.  Thank you. ",
