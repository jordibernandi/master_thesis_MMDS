He's seized what funds he can and applied them to the wall.  And frankly, we need the Congress to be more engaged to prioritize that element of border security.

Rod Rosenstein's being trashed by James Comey, and he's now trashing back.  They're both attacking each other's character.  And of course, there's Brennan and Comey.  They're blaming each other for promoting and pushing the dirty Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier.  And Comey's general counsel, James Baker, just revealed that He was, quote, quite worried that his boss, Director Comey of the FBI, was literally blackmailing Donald Trump with Hillary's dirty Russian dossier.  You couldn't put this in a spy novel, but it's all true.  Take a listen. ",

And so, yeah, we were quite worried about that, quite worried about how that would come off.  And so we wanted to try to make sure to... convey to the president-elect that that's what we were not doing, that, sir, we have this information.  It came to us in a particular way.  The press has it.  It's about to come out.  You should be alerted to that fact.  We don't want to proceed on this basis without you being aware of those facts.  But, no, we were quite worried about the Hoover analogies and were determined not to have such a disaster happen on our watch. ",

Edgar Hoover, of course, the FBI chief, who was famous for abusing power, spying on Americans, and yes, blackmailing his political adversaries.  But while Baker expressed concern over how Comey was using the dossier, he also claimed that the FBI took the dossier seriously, but not literally.  Really?  Because that was the bulk of information in the FISA applications.  So sounds like they took it literally.  Take a look. ",

But it was something that... something that we were obligated to deal with and obligated to assess given what we understood, what I understood to be the source of the information, Christopher Steele at that point in time.  We were obligated to take it seriously and look at it and try to figure out whether it was true or not. ",

            "text": "Hold on a second.  If you didn't take the Hillary bought and paid for Russian dossier seriously or literally, then why did James Comey in October 2016 swear?  It says at the top of a FISA application, verified.  Why did he swear that the contents were true and accurate in the first FISA request?  Why was that request mark verified at the very top?  Now, did James Comey lie then, or did he lie in January 2017 when he said to then-President-elect Trump, it's salacious but not verified?  He is at the very center of what was a multi-year effort by the most powerful, unelected bureaucrats, clearly first to rig an investigation into their favorite candidate when the evidence was overwhelming and incontrovertible.  Hillary Clinton, the Espionage Act.  Hillary Clinton, obstruction of justice.  The intent was clear.  Destroy the evidence.  And that's why you delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails.  That's why you'd use bleach pit.  That's why you'd have an aide take a hammer and bust up all your devices and remove all the SIM cards.  That would be intent.  Something they tried to pin on Donald Trump when there was no underlying crime.  Four investigations, including the Mueller report.  No collusion.  By the way, it's over. ",
