            "text": "Anybody got a question?  Yes sir.  The question from the young man.  to my right is that earlier on we said that America the white man is now targeting Iran and I think if I understood the question correctly he's asking the question.  so what's our stance?  what's your stance then in relation to this potential conflict?  how do you do you support Iran or do you support?  is that the gist of the question?  well to be honest with you The Iranians, according to our understanding, these are Muslims.  And of course, not every Iranian is a good Muslim, not every Iranian, we can't vouch for all of them, but we know that this is an Islamic country and that they primarily believe in Allah .  And we believe that they believe in the Prophet Muhammad , and so they are our brothers.  And so we must stand with them in truth and in solidarity.  Even though the British state and the British military and the American state and the American military may be against them, it is incumbent on us, it is duty for us to stand with the Muslims.  We cannot back them in anything wrong.  And we don't believe that Iran is doing anything wrong.  We do not believe that the Iranians were seeking nuclear weapons.  The Iranians have said over and over and over again that they don't believe in nuclear weapons.  They believe that nuclear weapons are immoral.  This is their pronounced statements.  And what they want nuclear power for is to be able to have a modern society, electricity and power, their hospitals and everything else that everybody else takes for granted.  But the West is so wicked.  that they don't want to see an Islamic nation rivaling them in power and in the ability to do for themselves.  They want Iran, like other nations, dependent on the West.  But the Iranians are too proud.  They refuse to depend on the West.  They are an independent sovereign nation.  They are thousands of years old, the Persians.  America is a couple of hundred years old.  It's a little punk attacking a nation that is so ancient with such connection to the Creator of the heavens and the earth that we stand with the Iranians in the aggression because in the Holy Quran, Allah says, in the event of aggression, we must fight against the aggressor.  So we're not going to go and take up arms, we're not going to go and fight, but we will speak the truth and we will try to enlighten the people while they spread their propaganda and lies about Iran so that people at least don't get fooled once again into cheering when they see hundreds and thousands of innocent men, women and children in Iran being bombed.  Thank you for your question. ",
