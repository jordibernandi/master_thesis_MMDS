Look, there are fascists running around the streets of Portland, but it's not Andy.  No.  And it's not the people trying to report on these people.  It's the people that are known as the anti fascists.  It's anti these people that put on masks and attack people and silence people using violence.  These are the fascists.  And Ted Wheeler, I mean, this guy, I truly can't even imagine being more of an embarrassment as a public elected official.  I mean, he's the head of the police.  Why are those people not all arrested?  We've got plenty of video on this.  I also think it's sort of interesting that even in the framing of this, that Andy's being portrayed as a conservative or as someone on the right, as if that somehow slightly excuses it.  He must kind of be a bad guy because he's conservative or on the right.  I know him well.  I don't even know him to be on the right.  What he isn't, though, he's not just a woke progressive.  So he's not just a far lefty.  And in the strange political times that we live in now, that automatically makes you a conservative or someone on the right or anything like that.  Also, of course, you know, this happened to happen during Gay Pride Month.  Andy happens to be gay.  He's also Asian.  Those are two minority points that he's supposed to get, according to the left.
