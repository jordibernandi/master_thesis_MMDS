            "text": "What's up, heathens?  How y'all doing?  Today we have more comments to get to, and they're actually a special set of comments, because we're actually reviewing responses of Flat Earthers to my Behind the Curve review, as well as my review of other Flat Earther responses to Behind the Curve.  So it's going to be an interesting sort of look today at the Flat Earth community.  But first, we gotta crown the dumbass from last week.  And last week's dumbass is... This dumbass right here!  Yes, this person who thinks that dinosaurs are a hoax and velociraptors are kangaroos or some kind of shit.  I don't know, saber-toothed tigers are walruses.  Like, I don't know where you get this shit, but apparently you just pulled it out of your ass.  Thank you for playing and picking last week's dumbass.  Be sure to leave a comment down below as to who you voted for this week.  If you picked this dumbass this week, then you win a million god points.  Remember, these god points are worth as much as any kind of advice you could get from a homophobic asshole.  Like Rick Wiles.  Speaking of dipshits.  Oh my god, I'm boring.  Apparently, my atheism is killing somebody's Christian soul.  Apparently, the godless part of my channel here causes me to be just an asshole.  Somebody calls me Fat Blubber.  And apparently, people that believe in the globe are always sick.  So, if any of these dumbass comments interest you, then please stay tuned.  Ah, but first we have... Today I Learn!  First up on Today I Learn, that the great white shark's entire genome is now decoded, with the huge genome revealing sequence adaptations to key wound healing and genome stability genes tied to cancer protection.  That could be behind the evolutionary success of long-lived sharks.  And I think that it's amazing that we can map the genome.  We can know what genes control what particular portion of these animals and what gives these animals certain natural characteristics.  I hope that we keep on mapping genomes of different species and everything like that.  And we keep figuring out all of these wonderful things about this natural world.  Also in today I learned that Princess Diana was 19 when Prince Charles 31 proposed to her.  Because royal custom requires Charles to marry a virgin, nearly every other woman of good lineage near his age was disqualified.  Everybody else had been fucked.  This was the last hill to fuck.  And so Charles was like, well, I guess that's all that I got.  Oh, man.  Royalty's kind of fucked up, isn't it?  And finally, on today, I learned that the reason there are so many Thai restaurants in America is that the Thai government had been training and exporting chefs using a tactic known as gastro diplomacy.  God, that's a hard word to say, right?  Gastro diplomacy.  I mean, it's a good idea to train people to be productive members of society before they, I guess, immigrate over.  I don't remember specifically going to a Thai restaurant, but I'm fairly certain that I have been to a Thai restaurant.  But I mean, to be quite honest, all of the Asian food kind of places, unless they're wildly different, they all just kind of meld together to me.  I don't know.  Oh, guys, you know what time it is, right?  We did the learning thing.  Now we got to unlearn some shit with... ",
