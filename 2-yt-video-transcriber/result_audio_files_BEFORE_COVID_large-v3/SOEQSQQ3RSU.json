And he told me that the Joel Osteen video that I did last weekend was taken down.  And so I was kind of surprised and I looked and sure enough, it's been blocked by none other than Lakewood Church.  I've learned it's better to let God fight your battles.  Let God be your vindicator. ",

But once again, a church that didn't like what I had to say regarding a sermon from their pastor contacted YouTube and blocked my latest video.  It's the one I did on Kanye West when he visited Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church just recently.  Now, the thing I find so fascinating is that there are literally hundreds of videos critiquing Joel Osteen on YouTube.  Here's one from Justin Peters, who I highly respect, and he's telling the truth about Joel Osteen. ",

But for whatever reason, this one got under the skin of someone at Lakewood.  Now, I guess it could have been the use of ding-a-ling in the title referring to Joel Osteen, but that's how I feel about his preaching.  Anyways, I hope you were able to see it while it was up.  And whoever it was from Lakewood that decided to block the video, I think Joel wouldn't approve of what you did.  if, in fact, he's being honest about talking this blessing your enemies and let God fight your battle stuff.  And also, I want you to know that everything I said in that video, I stand behind 100%.  And I challenge you, who took it down, to put that video back up and let people judge for themselves.  God's grace and peace in Christ Jesus to you.  Bezel T3 out. ",
