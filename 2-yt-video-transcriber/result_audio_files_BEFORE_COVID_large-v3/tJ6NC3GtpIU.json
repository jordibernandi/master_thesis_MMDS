            "text": "Good evening, everyone.  This is Steve Fletcher with the Trumpet for My People.  Today is March 29, 2019, and I have another wonderful update for you today.  This is the most exciting of all the updates.  This is an amazing understanding that I have received from the Lord, and the way this is all coming together, this is pretty undeniable what we are going to be taking a look at right now.  And I pray that you are super encouraged by this.  I do believe with all my heart that we have found the day.  We've been waiting for this.  And, well, we have biblical proofs that are all coming together.  And the eighth day is amazing that the eighth day is linked together.  to Nisan 1, the eighth day, okay?  So here is the information I'm gonna be sharing with you.  The eighth day in the Bible represents resurrection and regeneration, and it represents a new beginning.  We know that the Feast of Tabernacles is an eight-day feast.  It has the last great eighth day on the feast.  Hanukkah, too, is an eight-day feast.  But did you know that Nisan 1 in the Bible is also the eighth day?  The first day of Nisan is also the eighth day.  So this is an encouraging word as we are fast approaching Nisan 1, April 6th, 2019.  Now, the eighth day, God spoke to Moses saying, on the day of the first new moon, on the first day of the month, you shall raise up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.  Exodus 40, one through two.  The tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month of Nisan.  A very auspicious day, as will be explained more fully at the beginning of the book of Leviticus.  According to tradition, Moses erected and dismantled the tabernacle during the previous week.  During those seven days, Moses served as high priest and wore but one simple white cloak as discussed in the holy garments, a message of oneness.  On the first day of Nisan, the eighth day of this process, the tabernacle was inaugurated.  And we're going to see these two Bible verses that confirm how Nisan 1, the day the tabernacle was erected, is also the eighth day.  Here in Exodus chapter 40, verses 1 and 2, it says, The temporary and movable tabernacle that was erected in the desert was set up on the first day of the first month, Nisan 1.  Going to Leviticus chapter 9, we will see that the same day that the tabernacle was erected is called the eighth day.  On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel, and he said to Aaron, take for yourself a bull calf and a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the Lord.  So Nisan 1 is also called the eighth day because this was a process leading up at the end of the year, the preparation of the temple for and it was the first day of the first month in the second year after leaving Egypt that the tabernacle was set up.  It goes on to say that the second temple was dedicated under King Hezekiah, and special offerings were brought similar to the dedication of the temporary tabernacle.  This also happened on Nisan 1.  Nisan 1.  So we have a pattern here of both temples, the first and the second temple, both being dedicated on the first day of the first month, Nisan 1.  Now what I'm going to share with you is so incredibly amazing.  It's so incredibly amazing, and it's just like a seal on everything else that we are watching and waiting for.  It's a seal on the Jubilee.  It's a seal on the timing of the Lord's return and what is going to be our transformation, our transformation into holy temples in the Lord.  Okay, so we've seen now that the first temple and the second temple were both dedicated on Nisan 1, and that Nisan 1 is the eighth day.  Now look at this.  This is in the book of Ezekiel.  Ezekiel, starting in chapter 40, Ezekiel has a vision.  of the millennial temple.  Ezekiel has a vision of the millennial temple, and it's just an amazing vision that actually the whole vision is like eight chapters from Ezekiel chapter 40 through Ezekiel chapter 48.  But in Ezekiel chapter 43, within the vision of the millennial temple, In verse 27, it says, When they have completed these days, then from the eighth day onward, the priest shall offer on the altar your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, and I will accept you, declares the Lord God.  So we are talking about the third temple.  This is the millennial temple.  The third temple, which is us, because we are the temples of the Holy Spirit.  And Ezekiel shows that this temple was completed.  And then on the eighth day, from there, they began to sacrifice within the temple.  And so this is an amazing connection that we can connect the first temple, the second temple, and the third temple to the eighth day.  The eighth day, which is the first day, the first month of Nisan.  So we see that the first, second, and third temples are all dedicated on Nisan 1.  Nisan Juan is the eighth day, and in 2019, that is April 6th, 2019, and it's the end of the Jubilee 5778, as we have shared in our most previous video, which I will share the links with you, and I suggest that everybody gets up to speed with what is really happening, where we really are, the true understanding of about the Jubilee mystery revealed, and how the change of the calendar in the Hebrew nation is the biggest confusing portion of why people are going to miss this great event, because they are expecting the new year in the fall.  But in God's calendar, the new year is Nisan.  And so we are coming up at the end of the 70th year of Israel.  It's the end of the Jubilee year.  And the temples were dedicated on Nisan 1.  And Nisan 1 is the eighth day.  I mean, what more could we expect or look for?  We're waiting for the eighth day.  And the eighth day represents new beginning.  It represents eternity.  It represents resurrection.  It represents regeneration.  And now we found the eighth day connected to Nisan 1 and connected to the end of the Jubilee.  It's the perfect day where everything, completely everything lines up.  Saturday, April 6, 2019.  First of Nisan 5779.  The eighth day.  For behold... I create new heavens and a new earth.  All praise and glory and honor be unto Jesus Christ and to his Father, the Lord God Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.  I pray you are blessed tonight.  This is Steve Fletcher with a trumpet for my people.  The sign of his coming revealed. ",
