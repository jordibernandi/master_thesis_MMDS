            "text": "Hey everyone, ready to talk about something fun?  Readers, the first wave of reviews for Warner Bros.  and DC Comics' upcoming movie Joker have been released, due to the movie premiering at the Venice International Film Festival during Labor Day weekend.  And when I say that those reviews are a mixed bag, hoo boy, I'm telling you, every kind of nut imaginable is in that bitch.  Some people love it, some people hate it, and other people say that it teeters on being too safe and too toxic because of the overall take of the character.  And the latter has mostly to do with the feelings that a lot of individuals have regarding the fear that because it's a Joker origin movie, regardless of if it's an R-rated Elseworlds version of the Joker or not, that tries to give a more sympathetic take on the Joker character concept.  That it'll ignite a brand new wave of dangerous people that will relate to the anarchic chaos that the concept of the Joker and characters like him in one way or another inspire.  Especially in a film where there's no Batman.  Too long didn't read, people are worried that the solo Joker film is just gonna inspire more mass shootings or other dangerous actions from people who relate to this version of the Joker's incel-like upbringing.  And ever since talk of the movie started to surface from Venice, a lot of people had these fears confirmed in both positive and negative reviews of the movie.  One source in particular, a media website named IndieWire, who, thanks to movie reviewer David Ehrlich giving a thorough review of the film and a grade of a C plus as a result, went on to call it, and I quote, a bold and incel-friendly origin story.  Now, in case you're an individual who doesn't know what an incel is, why the media is currently obsessed with them, and or want to know more about them, well then I'm happy to let you know that I am not going to explain that shit to you.  I have no intention on turning this into a video essay, at least until I see the movie for myself.  That's also because Natalie Nguyen of ContraPoints already made a very well done video that goes in depth in their community, ideologies, and understanding them at their core.  You can click the card on the screen if you wanna watch her video for yourself, which I highly recommend that you do.  But what I want to focus on is the whole incel-friendly phrase that's been going around ever since the first wave of reviews came out for Joker.  Because according to said reviews, the movie clearly isn't talking about the type of incel-friendly that motivates said incels to leave their self-destructive red pill, black pill mindset in favor of things like cutting themselves off from the sources of those self-destructive thoughts in the first place, or regularly going to therapy to help improve their mental health.  Instead, from said reviews, the movie's version of incel-friendly seems to enforce the red pill state of mind that they have, implying that things like modern day society and radical feminism made them the way that they are, and the only way to avoid the nihilistic black pill mindset of just Lying down to rot because their oppressions are bigger than them is to instill anarchy and chaos in society as a form of revenge.  And the reason why people are so worried about Joker being a vessel for that kind of behavior It's because of people like Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in a murder-suicide stabbing and shooting spree in 2014.  And James Egan Holmes, who in 2012 killed 12 people attending an opening night screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, stating to police after his arrest that he was the Joker.  I'm an agent of chaos.  It also doesn't help that ever since the movie's premiere at the film festival, there have been people who both intentionally and unintentionally sewed that incel-friendly discord into the air, both through troll posts and genuine reveals of their character when giving critique, respectively.  For example, The Venice International Film Festival premiere of Joker was on August 31st and received an 8 minute long standing ovation from festival goers that attended.  In regards to the unintentional selling of Discord I mentioned previously, one of the critiques that was there was International Film Critique, who called Joker an ephesatious and disturbing film and calls Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker immaculate and a prodigious accomplishment.  mirroring pretty much the same review on their Letterboxd page.  And not only did the internet immediately pounce on this dude for the overall tryhardness of his use of the English language, but was also quick to point out this post from the same dude four minutes earlier.  In less than 24 hours, as 2008's Dark Knight claimed, the internet pretty much summed up this guy as the kind of mind that Joker attracts.  Meanwhile, in regards to the former, you have this image of a review for Joker making its way around the internet that reads, and I quote, This film is my Black Panther.  This movie empowered me.  It helped me get over my rejection from the female known as Veronica who'd rather date a Chad instead of a true gentleman that would treat her well.  Amazing cinematography and a great performance from Joaquin Phoenix who has fortunately moved on from artsy-fartsy hipster trash like her.  Films like Joker are true art that often get misunderstood by filthy normies who watch MCU kiddie movies instead of challenging, thought-provoking kino.  like Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice.  Yeah, this is a troll post.  Not only does every single bit of this review have keywords to gain the attention of multiple individuals for the sake of causing discourse, but look at the date of the post, my guy.  Yeah, this is a troll post.  This has troll posts written all over it.  I should know, not only do I know how the internet works, but I'm also a bisexual black man with a YouTube channel and an open comments section.  I have so much experience on this shit that I might as well put it on my resume.  But I also acknowledge and understand that not everyone can pick up on hints and clues enough to tell the difference between someone just trying to get their kicks and an actual post from the brain cell subreddit.  Some people just can't see the difference, and considering everything that's happening in this day and age, I really can't blame them.  Which is why I'm just as much in the corner of people afraid that this upcoming Joker movie is going to help validate the red pill extremist incel mentality that has shown its ugly head in real life multiple times in the past beforehand.  as I am in the corner of, regardless of the quality or entertainment factor of the film, learning from it, point out the dangers of taking on the manifesto that the movie implies, and present more healthier ways to work out their frustrations to the individuals that this movie possibly attracts if they don't have the willpower to do so themselves.  Because from the reviews that I've read, Joker, as good as it possibly is, is just... not a good movie to use as a case study if you're trying to understand the way this version of the character is portrayed in the movie.  And I say that as an individual who was initially against a solo Joker movie until finding out that it's pretty much an Elseworlds film and being impressed enough with the teaser trailer and who all other than Joaquin Phoenix was in it to give it a shot with minimum expectations.  Even if you have no intention of seeing this movie, whether it's because you don't want to feed into the pariah that it's causing, or you genuinely just don't give a damn about the movie, there are plenty of ways to get the same point across to the same individuals that this movie could negatively affect.  Volunteering at local youth groups and mentorship programs immediately come to mind.  And I also understand that, just like as a black man it's not my job to teach white people about racism and can be extremely exhausting whenever I decide to carry that burden, it's not necessarily the job of individuals that can unaffectedly watch something like Joker to tell these young men to take a shower and make something of themselves.  So if that's the case, Start with your family.  Start with your sons.  Start with your little brothers and nephews if they already look up to you.  Start with your little cousins after you share your concerns with their parents.  Be a beacon for them to follow so that others can follow suit and we'll have one less man that'll get indoctrinated into this red pill, black pill bullshit.  Because if you're not willing to help pave the way for this aspect of change, then someone else will.  And at that point, all you can do is just pray that they aren't as dangerous as the Joker.  I DID IT!  I WON AN ENTIRE VIDEO ABOUT INCELS AND I'LL MENTION JORDAN PETERSON ONCE!  HAHA BITCH!  YES!  So with that readers, your homework assignment for today.
