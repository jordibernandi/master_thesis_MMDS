            "text": "I would like to thank one of my subscribers, Astarte Jones, for this article.  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, it's downright laughable how these trolls are so overly concerned about what we do on our channels or what we're saying.  And there is a huge culture on YouTube of pedophiles.  A huge culture of people going to children and getting off on it.  It got so bad, YouTube's way of resolving the whole thing was to shut down the comment section.  But the pedophiles are still out here, ladies and gentlemen.  They're still out here.  And it's a huge culture.  It's a lot of them out here like this.  So for them to come over here and try to project that everything bad is coming from the black YouTube channels, get real, get real.  There are damn felonies going on out here on YouTube.  And here's one of them, one of many.  YouTube star gets 10 years for persuading underage girl to send him sexually explicit videos.  Alright, let's go ahead and see if we can listen to this video from CNN.  There you go.  Creepy.  Creepy.  And you notice there's also a big culture of these guys that can't even get dates.  No woman will go out with them.  And you can see why they're creepy.  And what's up with that comb over Justin Bieber looking hair?  Ha ha ha.  YouTube singer Austin Jones has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for asking underage girls to send him sexually explicit videos of themselves to prove that they're fans.  So he's 26 years old, and he had a huge teen following on YouTube, and this is what he was doing.  In 2017, he was arrested on two counts of production of child pornography.  Jones admitted to enticing six underage girls to make pornographic videos of themselves and send them to him according to a plea agreement.  The girls were as young as 14.  He plead guilty in February and on Friday.  US District Court Judge John Z. Lee sentenced him to 10 years in federal prison.  Production and receipt of child pornography are extraordinarily serious offenses that threaten the safety of our children and communities, Assistant U.S.  Attorney Catherine Neff Welch said in the government statement sentencing memorandum.  Jones' actions took something from his victims and their families that they will never be able to get back.  To get the videos, Jones told some girls to prove they were his biggest fans, that they were part of a modeling opportunity, and that he could assist them in gaining followers on Instagram.  the Department of Justice said.  Jones admitted using Facebook to persuade minor girls to send him pornographic videos and pictures approximately 30 other times.  So he was doing this all the time.  Like I said, there is a serious pedophilia problem on YouTube.  Okay?  But these trolls want you to believe.  the worst thing happening on YouTube are the black channels and what we're saying.  Man, if you don't get out of here.  He messaged girls as young as 14.  Even before his arrest, Jones had come under fire for his interactions with young fans.  In June 2015, he posted a 16-minute YouTube video in which he looked directly into the camera and admitted that he used to ask fans to send him twerking videos.  Nothing ever went further than twerking videos, he said.  There were never any nudes, never any physical contact.  Jones was first arrested in June 2017 at O'Hare International Airport and questioned in a recorded interview.  The complaint states, He waived his Miranda rights and admitted to using Facebook to have sexually explicit chats with underage girls, receive explicit videos from them, and view those videos for sexual pleasure.  He's a pedophile.  He instructed them on what to say.  A federal criminal complaint cites two instances of Jones messaging teenage girls to send him explicit videos of themselves dancing.  In one example, Jones messaged a girl who told him she was 14 years old.  Jones allegedly asked her to send videos of herself dancing in a sexual manner and refer to it as a tryout.  and an opportunity.  This dude is a pedophile.  I mean, according to the complaint, Jones instructed the girls on how to shake or clap their buttocks and expose themselves in videos for him.  At the beginning, get super close and say these lines.  Hey, Austin.  It's their name, I guess.  And this butt is age 14 or whatever their age.  And then clap for 30 seconds.  Got it?  Wow.  But wasn't he professing his innocence in the video before?  Oh, I only did this.  These people... Don't tell the truth about nothing.  Jones wrote on Facebook to the girl.  the complaint states.  She ultimately sent him about 15 videos of her dancing, including 10 videos in which she exposed herself.  The complaint states.  So he's 26 years old and this is what he's doing with teenage girls.  Man, if you don't get out of here.  But please tell me what you think, ladies and gentlemen.  This is sick.  It really is.  It's sick.  But you got to understand, there's a whole culture of these folks all over social media.  And YouTube is included.  But please tell me what you think, ladies and gentlemen.
