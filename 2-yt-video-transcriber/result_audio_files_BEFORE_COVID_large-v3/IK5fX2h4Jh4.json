It's all semantics.  It doesn't matter whether we use the term pull or push.  All we're doing is describing the relative directions the objects are moving in.  We're not claiming to be describing the mechanics of what's going on.  And that applies equally well to his favorite new force, which is push or applied pressure, as he likes to call it.

I don't know if anybody knows the exact specific mechanics of how gravity works, but we can't deny the fact that it exists, and we understand its behavior, and we can use it to make predictions and accurate models,  etc.,  etc.  But Dell wasn't happy with that.

This causes the troponin to change shape, move the tropomyosin out the way, and now the myosin head group can stick to the actin filament.  Now, it's worth noting that this can only happen if the myosin head group was previously bound with ATP or adenosine triphosphate, and then hydrolyze this or split it into ADP, adenosine diphosphate, and an inorganic phosphate.

What is happening to the molecules or rearrangement of those molecules to cause that myosin head group to change its position?  What forces are happening at that low level between the electrons and the protons in those atoms to cause that movement?  Can we call it a push?  Can we call it a pull?  How does that electrostatic force actually work?  Well, I don't know, and I'm pretty sure this guy doesn't know either. ",

Or even if we got down to the bottom of it with magnetism and found out that as magnets attract, they are somehow being pushed from the sides.  That doesn't support this silly argument that gravity can't exist at all.  We don't fully understand how gravity works.  I don't understand how gravity works.  But we can... use it to make accurate predictions.  We understand its behavior extremely well.  And if it turns out that there is some sort of push force that's pushing things to the floor, it doesn't mean gravity doesn't exist.  It just means we've gone one step deeper to learn how it works.  But anyway, some people in the chat of Dell's original video, which I've linked in the description, they don't want to go that one step further.  They're just happy watching somebody open and close a door.  Check this out.  Now, as you might expect, Conspiracy Cats is gonna be going to town a little bit on this whole idea in the next week or two at least.  But I just wanted to get this out now and get it out of my system.  But for now, this video's over, bye. ",
