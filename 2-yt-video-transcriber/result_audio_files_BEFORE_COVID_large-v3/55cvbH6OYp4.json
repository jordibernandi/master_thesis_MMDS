            "text": "these speed tests keep changing because some people are using this cell and they're not.  look we're now at 50 60.  Here we go again.  So I was talking about 63.  We actually got up to 63 that time.  Okay, we're going to upload again.  18.32 upload.  Now enjoy the rest of this video.  That's an order, son.  And it's a very interesting saw.  There's this button here that just holds it on for whatever reason you'd want to just hold it on.  I don't know why, that seems to me like a safety problem, but there's this guy here that allows you to turn this any direction you want using this lever.  Oops, there we go.  And so basically the whole drill or I mean saw is like in this cylinder that goes all the way through.  128 volts, 60 hertz, 6 amps, 2500 SPM instead of RPM.  I guess that's saw for a minute.  I don't know what that means.  And then they got a warning and all kinds of stuff on here and it's supposed to conform to UL standards and all that good stuff.  So it's these safety glasses it looks like.  So I haven't had any problems with this.  I have seen YouTube videos with people like Scotty Kilmer saying that theirs shorted out, blew the breaker, and blew up.  I haven't had any issues with this.  I do see a hazard here that I saw a little bit earlier.  So there's a fan in here to ventilate this thing.  And there's no shroud or anything to keep your fingers or a screwdriver from getting down in here or a bit or something.  I mean, your fingers, obviously, unless you're really tiny, aren't going to get in there.  At least they shouldn't be.  But basically a screwdriver or anything like that could get down in there.  So I think maybe they could have added some sort of a metal shroud around there just so that things wouldn't get down in there.  Maybe that would cause more problems.  I don't know.  It could.  Things getting trapped down in there.  So I put the Dewalt, I didn't use the Harbor Freight bits because I didn't trust them.  I got the Dewalt ones.  Maybe I should have got the Harbor Freight ones.  And I only got two Dewalt bits.  I got one for cutting wood, which is what this one is, and a metal cutting one, and I haven't had to replace them.  I've been using this to do a whole chicken coop project.  So it could just be the grace of God, in favor of God, that I haven't had to replace anything and everything just keeps working.  or it could be that these are good tools.  Now, to change these tools, like I just pulled this one out, it's got this round thing that you just turn on the end, and it's what it sits in.  Let me see if I can hold this up so you can see how this works.  So, you turn this end right here, and your unscrewing is what you're doing.  You can't screw it in, it screws itself in.  If you have to screw it in and it broke and you need to take it back, or throw it away or something but anyway.  so the blade goes in and then once it's in there you let go and it's just a spring and it screws itself back on and it's locked in there it's not coming out.  now I do have a video clip where it did shoot out because I didn't have it properly seated.  so you can make mistakes with it.  but Basically, there it is.  Like I said, I've made an entire chicken coop with it.  I haven't quite finished it yet, but I've done a lot of work.  I've used this for everything.  I haven't used any other saw because I don't really have a skill saw, I don't think.  If there is one, I don't know where it is.  I don't think I've ever used a skill saw.  Ah, goodness.  So I just use the Sawzall because I can cut the metal roof with it that I cut, I can cut the wood, I can cut everything, and I'm gonna try to show you some video clips of me using this Sawzall.  So again, this is the cheapest Sawzall at Harbor Freight.  It's like, I think, $19 with the coupons right now.  You know, it's funny, because things last year were a lot less expensive, some things, and now they're more expensive, but this thing I think is the same price.  And like I said, Scotty Kilmer, he says these are no good.  But so far, I haven't had problems.  Now, I think that I've probably used these continuously on high-duty cycle, at least average, because of cutting all the boards and stuff that I cut with this.  And it was a lot harder to cut boards than it was to cut the metal.  So I guess the question that you might have is, should you buy the more expensive Chicago Electric models?  And I don't think so.  I mean, it all depends on your preference.  Basically, as long as you have enough RPMs and your blades are in here and everything, you should be good.  The only reason I could think that you would need to buy a more powerful tool to do this is if you're cutting a thicker piece of something.  So what I did with this one when I was in the wood and it was slowing down because I was cutting straight, is I would just tip it forward and just cut the bottom only, then just cut the top only and just keep pulling towards that direction and just work it back and forth so that I wasn't cutting, you know, the whole two inches of wood that I was cutting through.  At least it's a two by six.  It's probably actually more like, you know, an inch, inch and a half across.  But anyway, um... you know what i'm saying.  and so uh you know if you're gonna cut tree limbs or something with this there you know may not be as easy to cut as using other things and you might have to get a really long uh blade.  now obviously there are supposed to be higher quality better branded blades than the ones i'm using but they are very expensive and also they usually go by the name devil or demon or something.  and I you know I don't know.  so I just figured I'd stick with these Dewalt ones and so far I haven't had any regrets or any issues with the Dewalt blades.  and you know if these ones break and I'm on a low income or if I'm just curious I might get the Harbor Freight blades just to see how they perform compared to these.  but so far.  Well, that means it's the end of the video.  But so far, these ones, only the paint is worn off.  You know, so that's about it.  Well, thanks for watching the video.
