One, there'll be no neo-Nazi or Nazi sympathisers on the same segment because I don't want to be aligned to them and I don't want to give them any legitimacy or anything like that.  Common sense.  The second one was that they don't cut my answers from one question and put it to another.  Now, to my horror, but not my surprise, they did exactly both.  Both those things.  But they went even further.  They connected me to the Christchurch killer, to the terrorist. ",

Now over the next few days, I'm gonna release a bunch of little clips that are important that he specifically didn't add to the piece.  We filmed for about an hour and there's about three or four minutes where he's included little snippets.  So in the next few days, I'm going to release little bits that are important that I think everyone needs to see.  But if you're on my Patreon, you can see the entire hour.

Now, I don't actually have a problem if you draw Muhammad, to be honest.  That's me.  But people like you call me an Islamophobe because that riles up, that upsets, that, in your words, triggers the Muslim into violence.  Now I wonder when this goes far and wide and help it, share it around, let the world see.  I want to see if the leftists condemn Jim.  And even more so, what I'm interested to see is the people that he is hell-bent on protecting.  The people that he is fighting so hard to let into Australia and the US.  Let's see how they react when they see him mock their prophet.  You know what the punishment for Blasphemy is Jim.  I wish you luck, brother.  But it gets worse.  Watch what he says when the cameras aren't rolling.  I'm not a big fan of Islam.  I think that wearing a burqa is stupid and demeaning and all these things. ",
