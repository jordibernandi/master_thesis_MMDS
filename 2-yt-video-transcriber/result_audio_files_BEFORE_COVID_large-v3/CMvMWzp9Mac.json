Since that's the case, biblical rules are not outside of human hands or influence.  Rather than constraining human abuses of power, the ability to convince people that they are doing a god's work has repeatedly been used to tyrannical ends.

But if people are encouraged to move away from Christianity, then they lose attachment to this story and the origin story of who and what they are becomes rewritten.  It's replaced with a focus on the worst moments in our history.  This is why in many modern liberalized Western nations nowadays, the native people are being encouraged to be ashamed of their past.  In social justice infested college courses in America, young Americans are brainwashed into self-loathing.  They're encouraged to feel guilty for atrocities committed by their ancestors from hundreds of years ago.  The same is true of many European nations.  Their people are being encouraged to feel an intense sense of guilt and self-hatred for their colonial past, for example.  So once the story we told ourselves about where we came from spiritually was based on the hope of a young child being born who could usher in a new age of peace for all humanity.  Now it's about negativity, despair and hopelessness. ",
