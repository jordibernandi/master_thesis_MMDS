Yeah, very popular in alt-right circles, incel circles, obviously, it's a dog whistle, if ever there was one, alright?  Definitely in the hashtag alt-right, and it's a pretty popular one.  It's known, alright?  People know what this word is, it's not like it's a secret.  Now, either Ben Shapiro is on the, I gotta defend the Nazis wagon right now, or he just feels that, you know, now's a good time to... now's a good time to defend her though anyone who doesn't know who Rebecca Lewis is by the way I'll make this bigger for you.  uh Rebecca Lewis is the uh.  wonderful individual who wrote the alternative influence network the academic paper that basically pointed out how uh there's a pipeline that you can go down if you're watching YouTube videos.  you start watching one YouTube video.  you might watch Joe Rogan and then Joe Rogan has on Dave Rubin and then Dave Rubin has uh.  uh let's say Stefan Molyneux.  Stefan Molyneux has on Jared Taylor Jared Taylor has on Richard Spencer and before you know it you are like Faraday Speaks and you've gone down this pipeline and you're in love with Lauren Southern.  Rebecca Lewis was the one who pointed that out so she wrote for those of my comments who don't seem to know.  so-called trad wives are white supremacist women who devote themselves to domestic duties in the service of perpetuating the white race.  it is a dog whistle meant to sound less white supremacist than it is.  for those in the comments who are white supremacists consider no longer being a white supremacist Now, this probably would have been all there was to it.  Then all of a sudden, Ben Shapiro retweets her.  And, you know, you love to see it because, you know, Ben Shapiro got way less likes and way less retweets.  This is uncharacteristic for Ben.  Like 119 retweets, 1.8 thousand likes.  Like, obviously, not doing that great. ",
