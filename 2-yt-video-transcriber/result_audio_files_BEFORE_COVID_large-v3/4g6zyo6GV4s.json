And Rogan and Jones had had a relationship since the late 90s.  For those that don't know, Joe actually called in on the 9-11 show trying to argue with Alex because he was already calling in a government inside job, talking about bombs in the building, the whole nine.  And Rogan was upset.  Now, on top of that, Jones is in one of his comedy DVDs, Belly of the Beast, where they both dress up like Bush and Son and go around in cloaks.  And that intro is the DVD.  So they had a long history.  And I was like, you know what?  Even after you're falling out because of some fear factor stuff, there was the horse drink.  We'll call it that, the horse drink. ",

Lee notice.  Lee saw a major body ... shift in the CEO of Jack Dorsey.  we saw him kind of ... stutter.  we saw him lose eye contact and say no ID why and ... a lot of people don't believe that because rightfully so ... they shouldn't.  this is a billionaire and if he is ... either completely gone from major decisions from this.  huge institution of power Twitter.  there's no other ... explanation for this.  and Joe kind of kind of let it.  by kind ... of let it swing and kind of change the topic right away ... when he personally knows individuals who were censored ... were banned.  not just Alex Jones but other individuals ... and the bias is very clear here.  there's a reason Saudi Arabia.  high Saudi Royal officials are investing so much in Twitter ... and have such a majority ownership of Twitter.  this is ... because Twitter is a main political weapon and it is ... being used in many different ways.  we saw many anti-war ... figures like Carrie weather be completely banned without ... explanation without reasons.  we're seeing people targeted ... within the Venezuelan government within the Syrian ... government obviously serving bigger geopolitical us goals ... and we clearly do see a bigger kind of political bias when it ... comes to him Joe Rogan and Jack Dorsey.  excuse me let me ... just focus on Jack Dorsey here with Jack Dorsey banning ... people for saying that the people who are getting fired ... right now should learn to code code like we saw tweeted ... by a Daily Caller editor who now had his account suspended ... because he just tweeted.  learn to code to the mainstream ... media that is obviously losing their jobs right now ... people who also bring up facts that fatherless homes ... lead to more crimes are also being banned while of course ... there's literally a New York Times Asian lady just ... putting out a full-on war on slot against white people ... and she gets verified.  we're seeing the Covenant kids ... being called to be doxed being called for harm to be ... done to them by major celebrities major media ... huge discrepancies huge political war happening here ... and Joe Rogan who says he believes in the rights of ... people to communicate with each other to give everyone a ... platform.  everyone thought he was going to make a strong ... And this is why there's been a lot of questions now of ... course Joe Rogan answered back answer back of course ... against Alex Jones as well and answered back even ... mentioning how Media Matters said that Alex Jones was lying ... and when you talk about Media Matters and Alex Jones you ... pretty much have some of the most erroneous institutions of ...

And we have to acknowledge that.  For instance, when we talk about Media Matters, that is a George Soros, David Brock institution.  And there is... Great documentation, not only with interviews from Soros himself, but that he was taken in by a Nazi collaborator.  His name was Kiss Sander.  And yes, he too also worked with Nazis, making him a Nazi collaborator in taking people's property.  That is absolutely 100% factual.  That doesn't mean, you know, he was by the side of Hitler, zig hailing.  But in those interviews, he's certainly not remorseful or regretful about it.  So let's be clear about that.  So that gives all credence to Jones.  Let's swing it around now for a second.  The things that Jones has said about Rogan, first of all, before the Dorsey interview.  Being a CIA puppet, essentially.  You watch that interview, and that's where he starts to go off the rails. ",

And any way Jones wants to spin it, there was a point in time where he called the thing a completely synthetic event with actors.  So, aside from Sandy Hook, what is Alex Jones talking about?  that's not true?  Well, number one... The way he's attacked Rogan, and he's got a snake, and he's calling him Snake Joe, and he's twisting his neck and calling him a tough jujitsu guy.  I guess we'll get into the fight later, but that is comical.  Then at one point, he literally says, and I quote, and we're going to play this for you, because I'm clear to fire, dude.  Jesus, who you hate so much, said, Jesus... told me to destroy Joe Rogan.  Because I'm clear to fire, dude.  Jesus, who you hate so much, said, Jesus told me to destroy Joe Rogan.  Now, next, I don't think Joe Rogan has ever said he hates Jesus.  He's never been a religious guy, but he's certainly acknowledged the good points of religion.  He actually talks about being agnostic and believing something beyond, you know, especially after those DMT trips that Alex Jones is condemning so much that there may be an afterlife or something more to this.  So he's being very dishonest there.  Let's all be honest.  When we play this clip, you look at Jones' face.  Even Jones knows he didn't talk to Jesus, and Jesus didn't tell him to destroy anybody, let alone Joe Rogan, Luke. ",

And 187 million hits before they erased it on Google Video.  Now, that part is, again, that's him spinning the truth.  So just so everybody understands, Alex Jones produced Loose Change Final Cut.  Loose Change Second Edition had nothing to do with him.  In fact, Joe Rogan actually bought the film before Alex Jones even carried it.  So let's get that little factoid out there.  Joe Rogan was the first guy to buy it off our website.  He bought a 10-pack.  Okay, and Jones still had not even contacted us at that point.  He produced Loose Change Final Cut.  Now, two Final Cuts credit, probably online, you know, maybe over 10.  Let's give it 20 million views.  Not 187 million views, had nothing to do with that, but he's going to tell you, I'm not jealous.  And he actually calls Rogan jealous.  He also says that he was bigger on YouTube than Rogan.  Now, again, overall... Since InfoWars has been around forever, maybe more views, but if you looked at not only Joe Rogan's podcast, if you looked at JRE Clips, King Joe Rogan, and the other dozen bootleg things out there with Rogan, there is no doubt in the past few years that Rogan has been much larger.  And then he says he's going to take them down.  Well, I hate to tell you, but Rogan's not going anywhere.  He appeals to a large audience.  That doesn't mean I agree with everything that he says, but I enjoy his long format of a two- to three-hour interview with someone.  Alex Jones used to do hour, two-hour long interviews with people.  Yeah, he would interrupt a lot, but those long-form interviews are long gone. ",

Again, I'm not that hopeful because you have one end where you don't think Joe Rogan can be that naive, especially being around somebody like Eddie Bravo.  You know, Eddie Bravo's super conspiratorial, so at some point he hears them all, what he believes, what he knows to be true, who knows.  But, for instance, attacking... Jones for some of the Pedogate stuff.  You know, the Jimmy Savile raping corpses, Jones is right.  That has absolutely been proven.  That's something that's been put out there by law enforcement.  It's extremely disturbing.  You know, the adrenochrome stuff, whether they are taking that from pituitary glands, I've seen that in other reports.  I don't know that I've seen it in the Seville case.  So again, that may be one of those things that's being misconstrued, and Rogan may have a point on.  So what I tell the audience is this.  There's no way you can keep your eyes off of this.  Jones, like you said, kind of does need this attention.  After all, he's been deplatformed.  He's lost a lot of revenue.  He's probably feeling it.  No matter what he says out there, yes, in the very beginning, that sent a lot of people to his platform at first.  but nobody left YouTube.  You know what I'm saying?  Nobody left YouTube, Luke.  And Rogan's got that voice, got that platform, and many others.  So in that respect, I am sympathetic to Jones, but how long it lasts, I don't know.

He will collapse in pain and say he ate a big bowl of chili before the match, and that was it.  Now, let's say, for instance, Rogan cannot strike.  This is how the match goes.  Alex, again, charges at Joe Rogan.  Joe Rogan then sidesteps him, takes his back, and chokes him until he taps.  Because I guarantee you, as country boy and tough as Alex thinks he is, he's not going to sleep.  He will tap before he goes to sleep. ",
