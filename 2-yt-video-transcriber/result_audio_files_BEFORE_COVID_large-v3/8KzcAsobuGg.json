            "text": "This is Terry Swoop of Swoop's Entertainment Vids.  In today's video, we're going to take a look at the late, great, beautiful Tammy Terrell.  Tammy Terrell was one of the most beautiful, greatest singers of the 1960s.  She was born on April 29th, 1945.  She got her first big break in 1962 when she signed with Motown Records.  At the time, she was only a teenager, but she was dating men that was much older than she was.  She worked with Smokey Robinson.  She worked with Barry Gordy.  But the most success she ever had was working with Marvin Gaye.  Her and Marvin Gaye scored several top 10 songs together.  Several platinum selling songs throughout the 1960s.  And their chemistry was amazing.  They sounded great together.  Out of all the duets, out of all the duet singers throughout history, I thought they sounded the best together than any other couple, even though they were never a couple.  At the time, Marvin Gaye was married and Tammy Terrell was in an abusive relationship with David Ruffin.  In 1967, Tammy Terrell developed a brain tumor.  Now, a lot of people have speculated over the years that her brain tumor was caused from being in an abusive relationship with David Ruffin.  All the beatings that she got from him caused the brain tumor.  But when a documentary was made about her life and they interviewed the doctor who was treating her for her brain tumor, He said the abuse that she got from David Ruffin did not cause her brain tumor.  It was a genetic disease that caused the brain tumor.  She ended up dying in 1970 at the age of 24.  Now to this day, people still blame David Ruffin for her death when David Ruffin did not cause her death.  He did abuse her.  He did hit her.  And I don't think any man who hits a woman should get excused.  But his behavior did not cause her death.  And it's sad to see a woman so beautiful, so talented, lose her life at such a young age.  She could have went down in history as the next Aretha Franklin or the next Whitney Houston, that's how great of a singer she was.  That's how beautiful she was.  Now they're planning on making a movie about her life.  The movie will star Kat Graham as Tammy Terrell.  But a lot of people want Tyra Jabe Henson to play the role because she looks more like Tammy Terrell.  If you look at a picture of them side by side, they look almost exactly alike.  It's almost scary.  But a lot of people have different opinions on who should play the role and who shouldn't play the role.  Leave a comment, rate, and subscribe. ",
