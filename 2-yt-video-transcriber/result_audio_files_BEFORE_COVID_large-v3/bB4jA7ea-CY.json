            "text": "Hello?  Hi.  I come in peace.  Oh, my gosh.  I come in peace, too.  Well, that is good to know.  My name's Alexandria.  What's yours?  Oh, my gosh.  My name's Alexandria, too.  Oh, my gosh.  She does this, like, every day.  Yeah, it was funny at first, but now it's just getting annoying.  We gotta get off this island, Chuck.  Oh, my gosh, Joe.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  I was just smelling her, that's all.  You can't do that, Joe.  We're on a deserted island.  I can do anything I want.  Oh, I don't care.  I sniff my way to the top all the time.  Alexandria, are you sure this is gonna work?  Oh, yeah.  I designed a special fuel made up entirely of coconut farts.  Did you say coconut farts?  Yep, coconut farts.  Well, I'm not gonna be sniffing those coconuts then.  Geez, now they're talking about coconut farts?  Yeah, it's getting crazy.  We gotta get off this island.  Well, I'm not going back until Trump has been in peace.  Yeah, me neither.  Have they got your newspaper today?  I don't know.  I'll go check.  Oh, it says here that Trump's still trying to build the wall.  Yeah, Trump is, like, seriously creating illegal immigrants by forcing them to enter this country illegally.  You really are quite unintelligent, aren't you?  If unintelligent means economics degree, then yes.  We're seriously never gonna get off this island.  Gosh, damn it, Nancy!  Stop being so negative!  Sorry, but it's the truth.  Yeah, I don't see us getting off this island anytime soon.  What if we, like, totally invented something that has never been invented before to get us off this island?  Oh, yeah, like we haven't already thought about that?  Well, I sleep with whoever I need to sleep with to get off this island.  Sorry, but I can't help you there.  There's a lot of places that you could bury bodies on this island.  Hey, Pete, you want to come back to my hut and slip into my hammock tonight?  Um, no.  That's, like, never going to happen.  Oh, my gosh.  What if mashed potatoes really meant applesauce?  OP, I'm wearing my bamboo underwear.  Sorry, I'm only attracted to my husband's bamboo underwear.  Wait a second.  If we land on the sun at night, we might just be able to get off this island.  When are we ever gonna get off this island?  I don't remember the last time I smelled a woman.  The only way we're getting off this island is if Trump gets impeached.  Well, we all know that's not gonna happen.  Does anybody have a shovel I can use to dig a six-foot hole?  Pete, is that bamboo in your pocket, or you just happy to see me?  I don't know what's come over me, but I've never been more attracted to women in my whole entire life.  Must be all them.  gas station boner pills I've been feeding you.  Well, whatever it is, I'm attracted to women now.  Well, it look like I'm gonna get a new raise.  I just took a dump.  It's one of those soft steamers, so it's literally impossible to pick up.  Hey, where's that soft steamer?  I'd like to give it a sniff.  Anybody got a shovel?  Well, it looks like we're gonna be stuck on this island for another four years.  Yeah, it doesn't look like Trump's going anywhere.  This is horrible.  I hate Trump.  Yeah, well, it is what it is.  Oh, man, what are we gonna do for food?  Four years?  That's a long time.  Well, if we run out, we'll just eat Alexandria.  Yikes!  Looks like I'm gonna be somebody's fart. ",
