It's that, and I think a lot of times, whether it's you guys or whoever it is, people across the world, when you do so much, you got so much you're doing throughout a game, whether it's defending, rebounding, passing.  Used to be conversations of I was a ball hog, but now... Now I lead the league in assists for the past three years or whatever it is.  That's getting squashed out.  So now the conversation is about shooting.  Next year, I'm going to become a better shooter.  After that, it'd be probably my left foot is bigger than my right one.  Who knows?  to me that's the.  that's why i know that when you do so much with the game you got so much impact on the game.  uh i expect a lot out of myself.  uh put a lot of pressure on myself to become uh a very, very great player because I know that I'm able to do so much throughout the game to impact the game, impact winning.  So that's why, back to your point, I don't really care what people say, what they think about me, because it doesn't really matter.  I know what I'm able to do and know what I'm able to do at a high level every night, and nobody else can do what I can do on a night-and-night-out basis.  And I truly believe that if they could, I'm pretty sure they would.  But I know for a fact that nobody can.  Do you think it's kind of strange that you get criticized as much as you do, given how much success you've had?  No, I don't, man.  When you do so much at a high level, a lot of haters come.  That's how life is, man.  That's life, man, when you... When you do so much, people gonna try to pull and take away and try to take that away from you.  But nobody can take away from you.  I've been blessed.  I stay prayful, stay thankful to be able to do what I'm able to do.  And nobody can never take that away from me, regardless of what it is, how many stories are written, how many stats are put up, how many numbers are put up.  It doesn't matter.  I take too much pride, time, effort to be able to go out and compete and play hard every night.  My body on the line can't take it away from me.  I will never let anybody take it away.  How many years you'll ask me?  every year I take the same masters because I truly believe it and doesn't change the fact of anything. ",
