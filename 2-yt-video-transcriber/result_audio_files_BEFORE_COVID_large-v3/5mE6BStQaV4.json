            "text": "Oh no!  Alright, so this is how my show used to work.  Episodes would happen by paid request.  You pay, you request a movie, and then I fulfill the request and the order in which they're received.  I don't do that anymore.  I closed requests late last year, but I still have a couple left in my backlog.  So, by coincidence, My schedule has me doing a video essay on Moe Better Blues, a Spike Lee joint, mere days after Spike Lee won his Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, but was then noticeably upset by the victory for Racism Movie for White People Green Book.  He walked out of the Oscars, and deservedly so.  Media got on his case for it, but fuck it.  If Spike Lee wants to walk out of the Oscars after the announcement of the worst best picture since Crash, another racism movie for white people, then he can.  I stand with Spike Lee on this, and I feel extra special shitty that by happenstance alone, I have to talk about the movie in which he most famously trafficked in hurtful, wrongheaded messaging.  Mo Better Blues.  I feel like I'm going to catch a lot of heat for this, especially this week, but this is my job and I have to suck it up.  But yeah, Mo Better Blues is not the height of Spike Lee's work.  And it's not just because the film is kind of a drag, but because of the Jewish caricatures used in the film that landed him in a lot of hot water with the Anti-Defamation League.  When you look at Spike Lee's movies, you can see how thoughtful he is as it relates to racial dynamics.  Do the Right Thing gave a sincere glimpse into racial tensions in America.  School Days showed us clashing attitudes in black communities.  Chirac is an unflinching look at urban gang wars.  and his consistent thoughtfulness is what makes his portrayal of the Flatbush brothers that much more uncomfortable.  Because Spike Lee is not some ignorant, privileged individual who never pays much mind to portrayals of marginalized people on screen.  That's not to say his films should somehow be held to a higher standard.  That would be unfair.  But that doesn't make the fact that it's Spike Lee doing this any less shocking.  It's like if Tom Hanks robbed a liquor store.  He shouldn't be held to a higher standard as anyone else, but it would also be really weird if that story just started trending on Twitter.  The Flatbush brothers are presented as crooked, conniving Jewish stereotypes.  The high-pitched whine in the way they speak, their odd gestures, their cruel, selfish, almost diabolical greed paint the picture of the propagandist's view of Jews.  Lee was hit by the ADL for this wildly offensive caricature, and he did not help his case by brushing it off in interviews.  once trafficking in the jews secretly have more power than you think conspiracy theory by saying that his movies can't be antisemitic because the jews would never allow his picture to be made in hollywood.  Yikes.  The phrase Jews control Hollywood is the favored anti-Semitic refrain from everyone from the Henry Ford-owned Dearborn Independent back in the 1920s to modern-day dog whistles from conservative politicians and pundits about how Hollywood values are poisoning Christian values in America.  Yeah, okay, I see what you did there.  The Anti-Defamation League website quoted a 1995 article by Stephen G. Kelman, a professor at the University of Texas in San Antonio.  Boosters and anti-Semites agree.  Jews have been prominent and predominant in all phases of the business, production, distribution, and exhibition.  Though individual Jews control Hollywood, Jewishness does not.  The problem with the line about Jews controlling Hollywood is that it's not about statistics, because yes, there are a lot of Jewish executives in Hollywood compared to the relatively small percentage of Jewish Americans in general.  The problem with the line about Jews controlling Hollywood is that it is never said benignly.  It's an accusation, as if the high percentage of Jews in studio positions in Hollywood is a scary problem rather than, you know, a bit of trivia.  It is said in conspiratorial, hushed tones and often accompanied by more overt propaganda meant to make Americans who are not Jewish afraid of a Jewish threat.  Nobody says, Jews control Hollywood.  Isn't that neat?  Why, back in the early 20th century, And then go off about the history of Hollywood and how influential Jews were in creating the motion picture industry we all love today.  No.  No, it's always either said as a bludgeon or at best said as a bad joke.  And this kind of thing is never said about institutions and industries in America that are dominated by Christians.  When Congress, which is predominantly Protestant, fails to pass a spending bill, nobody says, well, the Protestants sure did screw up again.  because the spending bill is unrelated to the religions of the representatives.  When the automobile industry recalls one of their models due to it being unsafe, nobody scoffs and calls it the Gentile car industry.  Portraying Jewish businessmen as greedy to the point of being inhuman feeds into the idea that the entertainment industry is somehow worse off because it has a Jewish percentage higher than one would expect.  The phrase Jews control Hollywood is considered dangerous in a world where most Americans still view so-called Hollywood values with suspicion.  Spike Lee did not say that Jews secretly control the world or show that octopus drawing that anti-Semites like to use, but by brushing up against the related suspicion of Jews who have media influence in America, it helps further that along more than it hinders it.  In Lee's defense, I think he actually knows that.  He's obviously experienced a kind of prejudice that I have not.  But as I've noted in other videos, directors can get pretty defensive in their interviews.  I'm willing to chalk this up to that, and if you've noticed my discomfort, it's because I really don't want to be the arbiter of justice as it pertains to Spike Lee.  But this happened, and I don't think anyone likes the idea of ignoring it either.  Hi, everyone.  This is the last episode before I do the soft reboot of the show next week.  I've mentioned this before, but you may have noticed that I'm getting a little burned out talking about the same old things.  So there is a lot of new stuff coming.  It will also look a bit different and better because I have new editing software and all kinds of other stuff.  So check out the soft reboot of my show next week with the much anticipated James Bond video.  And make sure to click on my Patreon to support the show.  I'll see you next week. ",
