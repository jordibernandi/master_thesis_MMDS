            "text": "Yesterday, President Trump offered to place our military, my brothers and sisters in uniform, under the command of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the dictator of the Islamist kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Trump said we are locked and loaded, but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed.  Now, Mr.  President, as you know, I have never engaged in hateful rhetoric against you or your family, and I never will.  But you're offering our military assets to the dictator of Saudi Arabia.  to use as he sees fit is a betrayal of my brothers and sisters in uniform who are ready to give our lives for our country, not for the Islamist dictator of Saudi Arabia.  And for you to think that you can pimp out our proud servicemen and women to the prince of Saudi Arabia is disgraceful.  And it once again shows that you are unfit to serve as our Commander in Chief.  As a member of Congress and as a soldier, I and all of my brothers and sisters in uniform have taken an oath to protect and defend the American people and the Constitution of the United States of America.  There is nothing in our Constitution that gives you the power to go to war without the express consent of Congress.  What to speak of giving you the power to offer our military to a foreign power like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to use as they wish.  President Trump, your words and actions are a betrayal of my brothers and sisters in uniform, the American people, and our Constitution.  My fellow service members and I, we are not your prostitutes.  You are not our pimp. ",
