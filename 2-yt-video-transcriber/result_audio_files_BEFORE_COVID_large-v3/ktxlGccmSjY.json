Ad hominem fallacies try to disprove an argument by focusing on the character of the person.  I think God's existence is necessary based on the concept of a perfect being.  No, you're wrong.  You're just a Bible-bashing Christian who cannot fit into a modern world.  Insulting a person's character does not mean their arguments are invalid and we should only focus on the arguments raised rather than who is saying them. ",
