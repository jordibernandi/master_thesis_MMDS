            "text": "Hey everyone!  So today's video is one that I'm actually extremely proud of.  I sat down and I had a discussion with a detransitioner.  Her name is Elle.  She transitioned to a boy at 15 and is now transitioning back into a woman.  Now I've talked about detransitioning a few times on my channel, but I've never spoken in my life with someone who has actually detransitioned.  And detransitioning is something that is incredibly taboo within the trans community.  A lot of people who tell their stories of detransitioning are bullied and shamed and silenced.  Some trans people take it as an attack on them when detransitioners tell their story.  I can only imagine that they feel delegitimized in some way, that acknowledging that people make a mistake when transitioning makes people think that they made a mistake.  I'm here to say that I'm a trans woman who is incredibly happy with my transition.  I would not change a thing, never will, but I feel like it's only right to discuss the opposite end of the spectrum.  If we're gonna tell these stories about how transition works for everyone, which I don't personally believe, I feel like we should also be fair and discuss people who thought it worked for them and didn't, especially kids, teenagers, which is the case of Elle.  So I encourage you guys to watch to the end.  Please reserve any harsh comments or judgments on Elle.  Just like all of us, she's just trying to figure stuff out.  And without further ado, here's Elle.  So you are the first detransitioner I've ever spoken to, which is crazy because I've talked about it before, but I've never actually spoken to someone who's been through it.  So correct me if I'm wrong, but you transitioned from female to male and now back to female.  Is that the right terminology? ",

And I think I kind of look at it as like.  my puberty was like medicalized because when I was having a lot of like mental health problems when I started puberty.  Was like my parents took me to the doctor and they were like, you know Like my kid like doesn't want to get out of bed like is really depressed like what's going on?  And they just I think they just tried to medicate me and put me on a lot of pills and like didn't really try to like Dig into why I was feeling that way.  so from a young age I kind of felt like oh something is just wrong with me like mentally and like I just was trying to figure out what it was right.  and When I found out, like, about, like, that being trans was a thing when I was 14, I was like, this has to be, like, the thing that's wrong with me.

So you feel as though the issues you were having as a kid set you on a journey to where you were looking for the fix and you ended up feeling like transgenderism was the fix.  You know, there are a lot of changes, bodily changes that come from medical transition, whether it be hormonally or surgery.  You said you haven't had surgery.

That's how I feel.  And it's really hard to deal with that.  And then the other thing that is like, it bothers me, but it's not that hard to deal with is like, I have some facial hair.

It would almost feel like a personal attack on me.  Like, Like you went through what I went through and I'm so happy, but you're not like, and, and, and what does that mean for me?

I remember \u2013 A year or two ago, if you Google detransitioners, there's like maybe three or four kind of famous cases and they got no attention.

And sometimes getting only one side of things can distort your view on what the right decision is for you.  That's something I always personally battle with is the fact that, you know, I'm trans and I'm on YouTube and I have a large platform and I worry myself about maybe glamorizing it or making it seem as something that is the right move for everybody, which is why I often try to say, like, it was the right move for me.  It doesn't mean it was the right move for you.  And it's also about saying it doesn't mean that transitioning as a whole needs to be thrown out and that it never works for people.  Because personally, I feel it does work for people.  But we have to allow nuance in the conversation to say, for some people, it doesn't.  And this is another thing.  This is another reason why... I hold my stance against very young kids transitioning because this whole idea of kids transitioning is predicated upon the belief that you always know, right?  It's on the basis that when you know, you know.  When you say it, it means it's 100% true.  It's not the case.  I'm sure you agree.  Yeah. ",

And I think this is a decision that has to be made by an adult who can think about the future, who can think about every little thing that's going to come along with it.  Even as a 16-year-old, I didn't think about how it would affect me three years from now, like five years from then.  I didn't think about that.  It was only what mattered to me at that moment. ",
