            "text": "Hello, this is Tony Hiller from realclimatescience.com, setting the record straight about climate.  This video is titled, Rapidly Growing Glacier Ended His Skepticism.  At the end of 2016, the Washington Post ran this article.  With enough evidence, even skepticism will thaw.  Petermann Ice Shelf, Greenland.  Andreas Munchau had his doubts about whether warming temperatures were causing one of the world's great platforms of ice to melt and fall apart.  He even stood before Congress in 2010 and balked on whether climate change might have caused a mammoth chunk of ice four times the size of Manhattan to break off from this floating 300-square-mile shelf.  The University of Delaware oceanographer said he wasn't sure.  He needed more evidence.  But then the Petermont Ice Shelf lost another two Manhattans of ice in 2012, and Munchau decided to see for himself, launching a project to study the ice shelf intensively.  He was back again in late August, no longer a skeptic.  It was hard not to be a believer here at 81 degrees north latitude, where Greenland and Canada very nearly touch.  The surface of the bumpy and misshapen ice was covered with pools and puddles, in some cases frozen over but with piercing blue water underneath.  Streams carved through the vast shelf, swelling into larger ponds or even small lakes.  So the story is that Andreas Munchau traveled to the Pietermann Glacier, at the end of the summer in 2012 and started a research project there.  And what he's seen since the end of summer in 2012 has ended his skepticism.  So let's look at satellite imagery to see what's happened at the Petermann Glacier since the end of summer in 2012.  All of the images I'm going to show you are from the NASA website.  This circle shows the location of the Petermann Glacier way up in northwest Greenland.  And this image shows the ice edge at the end of summer in 2012. when Munchaus started his research.  So based on the Washington Post article, it would be safe to assume that the ice edge has retreated since 2012.  But the exact opposite has happened.  The glacier has grown about one kilometer per year since 2012 and now extends about six or seven kilometers further than it did at the end of summer in 2012.  I'm going to loop through this animation a few times so you can see the growth year over year. ",

            "text": "So the Washington Post article was trying to convince the readers that the glacier is falling apart, when the exact opposite is happening.  It's grown quite a bit since Munchaus started his research.  Nobody should be surprised that the Washington Post is lying, because they lie about almost everything.  But there's other things about this which I find particularly disturbing.  Why haven't other scientists in the academic community called out this nonsense?  Why is it up to me to go do five minutes of research on the NASA website to find out what a big lie this whole story was?  The corruption in climate academia is obviously very deep.  Now let's talk a little bit about the science of glaciers.  This is one of the favorite types of imagery of climate alarmists.  They show pictures or videos of walls of glacial ice falling off into the ocean.  This is known as glacial calving, and the Washington Post article mentioned big calving events at the Piedmont Glacier in 2010 and 2012 right before Munchaus started his research.  But does glacial calving really have anything to do with climate change?  Let's take a look at that.  Glaciers are rivers of ice.  Nearly 600 billion tons of snow falls on Greenland every year.  In order for the ice to stay in equilibrium, all of that snow has to eventually return to the sea.  There's three ways that can happen.  One is evaporation.  Another is the surface of the snow melting and the water flowing off to the sea.  And the third and most common way this happens is the ice flows to the sea as a glacier and then calves off into the ocean.  Basically, the glacial ice is doing the same thing as a river, except it flows much more slowly than liquid water.  Saying that this giant waterfall of ice is due to global warming would be as ridiculous as saying that a huge waterfall flowing into the sea was due to a drought.  What we're seeing here is not an indication of a retreating glacier, rather it's the indication that there's lots and lots of snow falling in the interior and it's flowing down to the sea.  Large amounts of glacial calving like this is an indication of a very healthy glacier.  There's always been lots and lots of large glaciers calving off into the ocean around Greenland and making large icebergs.  Everybody should know this.  In 1912 the Titanic crashed into one of these huge icebergs which calved off from a glacier and most of the people on the ship died.  Everybody knows that story.  So why are the Washington Post and Andreas Munchau claiming that large icebergs calving off from the Petermann Glacier in 2010 and 2012 an indication of climate change?  That simply isn't true.  And even more disturbing, why are they claiming that the Petermann Glacier has shrunk since the calving event in 2012 when it's actually grown very rapidly?  The Petermann Glacier has grown almost three feet per day since Munchau started his research at the end of summer in 2012.  We should all be very concerned about the fact that our so-called free press and scientists in academia are lying to us in such a bold and obvious fashion.  And why is it left up to people like me outside of academia to set the record straight?  The climate situation is indeed very alarming and is indeed a crisis, but it's not the climate itself that's the problem, it's the people who are pushing this scam.
