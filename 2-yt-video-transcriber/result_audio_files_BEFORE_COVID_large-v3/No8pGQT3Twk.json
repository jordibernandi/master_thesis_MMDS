You know, this 60 Minutes interview with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former, since fired, of course, aired last night.  And it was kind of, you know, it retreaded a lot of things that we knew, but it really, I think, expressed for the American public in clear detail that you had a real effort inside the FBI and the Justice Department to get rid of, to take out the President of the United States.  That was my takeaway.  What was yours? ",

What you saw last night on 60 Minutes, coupled with Mr.  McCabe's new book, was a signed confession that they violated the law, that they committed subversion and sedition against the President of the United States.  They wanted Hillary Clinton to be president.  She lost.  They had to figure out a way to get rid of Donald Trump.  And so they created a fake investigation based on no facts whatsoever.  You will notice that during that lengthy interview last night, all you got was the conclusion from McCabe that they had a basis for investigating the president.  prior to the firing of comey.  there was no basis and indeed scott kelly never asked him to articulate what the basis was although scott kelly thought he scored a coup.  what he did was he revealed the coup and he looked like a fool as did robin roberts.  uh... on a b c in the other case involving uh... mullet.  just so whatever you want to say about scott kelly in sixty minutes they accidentally performed a public service in the service of the citizens of the United States.  Comey, McCabe, Baker, Strzok, Page all need to be behind bars.  And their worst nightmare just happened yesterday.  Bill Barr walked into the building this morning at 9th and Constitution. ",

Republicans are idiots, and they demonstrate it every day.  The president has authority delegated to him first by the Constitution as the executive branch and the commander-in-chief to defend that border.  Second, Congress in 1976, because it's lazy, decided to delegate its emergency declaration powers to the president of the United States.  The president is using the same power that a series of presidents have used 70 times to declare emergencies, 37 of which are still in existence for many, many years.

With the exception of Lindsey Graham and a few other people who fought genuinely hard to deal with this, the president is basically acting alone.  He has no support from the Republicans in Congress.
