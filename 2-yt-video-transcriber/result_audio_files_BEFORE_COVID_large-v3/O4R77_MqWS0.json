            "text": "Okay, before we get into the issue of the Ten Commandments, we've got to remind ourselves what this is actually about.  This is supposed to be an argument against God's existence.  Why you shouldn't believe in God.  I mean, if these things were in the Ten Commandments, would Hemant Mehta believe in God?  If the Ten Commandments had perhaps for number seven, instead of what it says now, it says don't rape.  Like if that's what it said, would Hemant believe in God?  Or would he perhaps come up with another example of something that's not in the Ten Commandments?  and then he would use that as an attack against God.  Because I really doubt that these are actually reasons that someone would not believe in God or that someone should believe in God.  The composition of the Ten Commandments is not evidence for God or against God in all reality.  Okay, now let's get into the issue of the Ten Commandments.  There's a weird assumption going on in this video.  It's that the Ten Commandments are supposed to cover every single human behavior.  I mean, the Ten Commandments have left off quite a lot if you really isolate them.  For instance, it never says in the Ten Commandments not to throw your kids off of cliffs.  It never says not to abuse your spouse.  It never says not to hide your grandpa's teeth.  Like it never... says any of those things, nor did it need to.  The Ten Commandments aren't the summary of the whole law.  It doesn't mean God approves of those things.  It's just not addressed.  Really, this is like saying, because these commandments didn't address these issues, I don't believe in God.  This doesn't follow logically.  This isn't rational.  Sometimes, I think skeptics, and if you're listening to me, skeptic, I think sometimes you feel so secure in your skepticism that you're not thinking it through.  If you want to look at an actual summary of the Old Testament law, you can look at the summary we have in Galatians 5.14.  And it summarizes what is the summary?  What is the whole law saying?  Galatians 5.14 says, \"...for the whole law is fulfilled in one word, you shall love your neighbor as  yourself.\".  There's the summary of the whole law.  Doesn't that encompass the issues that he's worried about?  I think it does.  In Romans 13, it gives us another summary.  Owe no one anything except to love each other, for one who loves another has fulfilled the law.  For the commandments, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and any other commandment are summed up in this word, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.  Love does no wrong to a neighbor.  Therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.  So this idea is we love to fulfill the law.  If you're looking for a summary statement, you can apply it to all kinds of issues, including the issues brought up in the objection about rape and slavery.  And I have content online.  If you want to dig into the Old Testament teachings on those issues in particular, I have content online that teaches that.  But really... This complains about the Ten Commandments.  Jesus himself agrees with this summary.  In Matthew 7, 12, he says, Whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the law and the prophets.  In Matthew 22, 36, Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?  He is asked in Jesus' response.  And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.  And this isn't just New Testament.  This is Old Testament.  Deuteronomy 6, verses 4 and 5 is what Jesus is quoting.  There is the summary of the law.  To love God with all your heart, soul, and mind.  In verse 38, he goes on, this is the great and first commandment.  And a second is like it.  You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.  So we can interpret them through this lens of love, loving God first, loving our neighbor as ourself.  And of course, if you want to get into the nitty-gritty, the debate over the specific laws and situations of the Old Testament, which skeptics often like to use, in my opinion, out of context with an agenda to make the Bible look bad.  And I'm happy to do those debates.  In fact, I've literally done them multiple times online.  But again, Hemant Mehta's issue isn't with the entirety of the law. ",
