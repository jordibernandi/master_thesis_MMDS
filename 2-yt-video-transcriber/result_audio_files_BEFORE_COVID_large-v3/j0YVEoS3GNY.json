We've got card number 1287G453HE.  I'm a documentary.  Can you show me how to make my picture take?  I don't take pictures.  I can't even see the screen.  For Facebook.  Yeah, I can't figure that out.  Yup.  Ah.  And we got unit number 1594 G736EY.  Thank you.  Once again, sir, you do not have the legal right to film our property.  How about suck my ass?  Please do not film our property.  How about suck my ass?  Do not film our property, sir.  I am on private, I'm on public property.  Does not matter, you do not have the right to film our property.  Please do not film our property, sir.  Suck my ass.  I'm asking you once again, please do not film our property, sir.  Sir, please do not film our property, sir.  Officer.  Kick rocks.  That was the walk of shame.  Officer, I don't want him filming my property.  Sir, he has the right to film your property.  He's standing on public property and has the right to do so.  Ah!  You made me mad.  You gotta let them know that they're not gonna bully you.  You gotta let them know straight up.  They come out trying to put the fear in you.  Stand your ground. ",
