            "text": "I mean, I must have been in maybe like 9th or 10th grade and my mom, you know, concerned about my future.  Just having this conversation, what do you want to do with your life?  And I just remember saying that the goal was not to be happy.  I wanted to be an artist and I wanted to make something that would live on.  That idea, it's been with me for decades.  I sort of saw it recently as like, wow, that is so presumptuous.  that you can do something that's gonna like stand the test of time.  I had that first wave of recognition and sort of was on a ego high from that whole thing and survived the sophomore project.  And then went through a really turbulent time, realizing what all that notoriety was built upon and how it's maybe not really real.  And there was a big part of me that was wondering, like, am I going to leave behind, you know, being an artist?  That was kind of what led me to this farmhouse project.  This farmhouse, it was a secret.  My wife knew that I bought it, and my studio manager knew, but they didn't go out there, and I actually asked them not to talk about it.  I basically wanted my childhood home, but you know, it didn't exist anymore and also I couldn't afford it.  So I bought the cheapest thing that I could find that would somehow bring to mind that place.  This place was, it was about boyhood for me.  And so I originally bought the farmhouse as a place where I could learn how to get back to playing in that childlike way of playing by myself and having pretend friends and living in my own imagination.  I was working at the farmhouse very sporadically for about a year.  I just, I wasn't feeling it.  The fact that it was spooky and haunted looking, I didn't have heat, I didn't have water, and all of that contributed to me not being comfortable there.  It's also the kind of place that begs for teenagers to break into.  You know, I never saw these people, but I can imagine what's going through their minds when they break into this place.  Like, we know your secret.  You know, we know you're this serial killer living here.  The whole place was kind of charged with negativity.  I thought, okay well that's the end of this farmhouse project.  The thing that shifted everything was meditation.  Meditation became more and more prominent in my life.  Then I started going out there all the time.  It was really different.  The creepiness was taken away, but in part because I would often go with other people.  I really did have like a clarity of thinking.  Like, if you can just stop talking to yourself and you're like, wow, there are birds chirping right now.  Like, how did I not hear this this whole time?  My big thing when I went out there was to not have too much ambition to make anything.  Like, it's okay if I just go for a walk.  The drive out there, that could be the artwork.  One of the things I would do is I would watch the sun move through the room in different shapes on the walls.  And I would try to frame it with masking tape.  So I would like trace the shadow and then watch as it moves and then keep re-taping.  I just thought, you know, kind of everything is worthwhile.  One of the things that meditation did for me, it made me realize, like, how much of life is just this talking inside my head, you know, over and over again.  meditation sort of made me less egotistical.  And so I saw through a lot of that stuff of like, I'm going to make something great and it's going to change the world.  Photography, you know, I often compare it to like being a hunter.  My photographic practice is like going out in the world, you know, hunting, and then like I take down this beast.  I drive away and I'm sort of satisfied with the thrill of the hunt.  In this new state of mind, I wanted to work at engaging with people in a more sort of human way and in a less sort of predatory sort of way.  After I sort of woke up to this new way of how to live, I realized I needed to like clue everyone else in on this situation.  I had this meeting with my, you know, very powerful New York gallery and told them I'm thinking about everything in a new way.  My work's really going to change.  I remember like talking to my parents even and saying like, sit down, you know, and coming out of the closet is like a happy person.  And really it is like the happiest year of my life.  It was doubly weird because this is the era of Trump and everyone's super unhappy, the world's going to hell, and I was just on cloud nine and really thought that I'd kind of figured out how to live.  There was sort of a moment Like it occurred to me like this year, oh, I was like in a monastery.  And I wasn't exactly engaging with the real world of, you know, fiscal responsibility and stuff.  And like my bank account is going down and down and There was this kind of crossroads.  And that's where I did have this conversation with my wife saying, like, we're going to have to really think about living in a different way without lots of overhead and all that stuff.  Or I'm going to have to go back to, you know, grown-up work.  And it's something that really bothers, I mean, this bothers me.  Because I really feel like I sort of made a decision to be less happy.  That's not a thing I'm so proud of.  I think every artist knows this feeling.  My work, you know, it's the thing I'm good at based on all these decades of devoting myself to it.  So to give that up, it's a big thing to give up.  And it's funny because actually the work that I'm making right now, it does have a lightness to it.  Like people have commented on this already.  It's like there's something different.  Oh, that's good.  It's like, you know, it's evening out in some other sort of way. ",
