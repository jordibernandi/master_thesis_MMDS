            "text": "It has a community watch in the city of Rancho Cucamonga, I believe.  It's a little windy, so I'll talk loud and close to the mic.  Doing the West Valley Detention Center here in Rancho.  From what I've heard, it's got a bad rep.  So everybody's been asking me for us to do this, but I'm by myself today.  Everybody's busy and... I decided to do this by myself.  It's a pretty long walk.  And we'll see how they behave about public photography.  It is San Bernardino sheriffs, so we'll see.  Just taking a video.  The what?  The jail.  For what?  What purpose?  My purpose.  Your purpose?  Okay, but why is there?  I don't have to answer you that.  It's a lawful act, so I wish to break contact.  Thank you.  You can contact your supervisor if you need to, but... We are his.  I suppose not.  All right, you have a good day.  I didn't know.  Why are you... You don't need to know anything.  Is this a crime?  Yes, you are.  You take your pictures.  That's a noise going in and out of the facility.  You don't do that to people with personal vehicles.  What law is that?  State of Penal Code.  State a penal code, because penal code 148.G clearly establishes the fact that I can record any public entity, you, your supervisor, and that photographer.  No, no, no, you work for me, I don't work for you.  You'd be in live stream too, so there's already calls being done to you.  You see this guy?  This guy thinks because he pulls up on his property when I'm not doing nothing wrong.  Fort Dice versus Seattle clearly states the fact that I can record public officials.  148.G clearly states that photography alone, when it's done in a legal spot, cannot be deemed suspicious.  So I would suggest you get a supervisor, sir.  Before you make your department look bad, I would get a supervisor.  I know what I'm doing very well, sir.  Just doing a little story, man.  Yeah, where my tax dollars go.  Yeah, including yours.  My tax dollars go to pay you.  That's why when you approach me, you should have more respect.  In any other field, if you... I'm here, but you're telling me that I need to tell you.  I don't need to tell you anything.  No, I know, but I... Yeah, but you said you wanted to know.  No, I'm not.  I'm public property, sir.  I am public property.  Are you against the First Amendment, sir?  What is your name, badge, number?  This is Dean Martinez.  I don't need to give it.  No, thank you, sir.  No, thank you, sir.  For what crime, sir?  Hey, can you guys make a call?  I'm at the West Valley Detention Center in San Bernardino.  Mr.  Martinez thinks that just because he pulls up and he's wearing a tin badge, you can just ask for an I.D.  when I'm doing a First Amendment protected activity.  You ain't going to get no  I.D.?  Because I'm not doing anything wrong.  What's your name?  No, thank you.  You can call me Good Citizen.  What's your name?  You can call me Good Citizen.  What is your name?  I don't need to.  I'm not committing a crime, sir.  I'm just doing a little story.  Now you're making, now you're making, doing a story.  A story for what?  For me.  For yourself?  Yeah, free press.  Free press, yeah.  Free press?  Yes, sir.  Oh, okay.  That's fine.  He's trying to ID me.  He doesn't have a crime.  I know very well what I'm doing, sir.  And you can't just pull up and start asking for ID.  That's not how the law works.  You.  Yeah, but that's who you're trying to ID me.  We're trying to ID you because you're just out here making pictures.  But that's not, that's not, okay, what is your ID law, sir, in California?  I'm not only, I'm supposed to ID after I'm legally booked.  That's the law in California.  You can ask me for my credentials.  Well, you work for me, sir.  It doesn't matter.  Okay, let me see your ID where you live.  Why would you need to see my ID, then?  I don't need to see your ID.  I'm just asking who you are.  I'm a citizen, taxpaying citizen, who employs you, sir.  Who employs me?  Yes, sir.  He's the guy who sits in front of... We've had many run-ins.  Have fun out here, sir.  You have a good day.  Hey, Martinez.  I'm not going to charge you this time for educating you, man.  All right, you're welcome.  I was talking to Martinez.  You already were educated.  See this guy?  Like that, they get good cops hurt, man.  It's actions like that that get good cops hurt because he pulls up thinking that people are his property.  Hey, you got school today, huh, youngster?  You got school today, huh?  Yeah, you were trying to come on strong with me, huh?  Got shot down by your own law that you protect, sir.  Listen, it keeps me in check, too, and it keeps you in check, both of us.  I thought that guy was going to grab me. ",
