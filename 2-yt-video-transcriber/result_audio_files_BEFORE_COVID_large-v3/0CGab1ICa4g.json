They wrote a really, really long testimony. ",

But anyway, while we're here, I just want to go ahead and maybe bear my testimony a little bit while we're waiting for Walt.  I hope everyone can hear me.  But I didn't always know that Joseph Smith was a prophet.  I... always wanted to know and always wanted to seek that knowledge because if I didn't know that it would be very difficult for me to know anything else about the church and it being true.  So I searched the scriptures and I prayed with all my might and When I was reading the Book of Mormon, you know, I'd read it many times, but one time I was reading it and I got an overwhelming feeling that this is a true book.  This is scripture that is meant for our time.  And I got a testimony of the Book of Mormon and I realized that because I had that testimony, it didn't matter at all.  if I knew that Joseph Smith was the prophet at that point, I knew the Book of Mormon was true.  And if the Book of Mormon is true, then Joseph Smith was certainly a prophet of God.  And I know that many of our viewers have sent in their testimonies, and I wish that we had time to have everyone talk about it.  But once again... We have a big, giant program for everyone.  Going to be starting at 7 o'clock Mountain Standard Time.  And I hope everyone is pumped for Christmas and for our Christmas show.  Anything to say, Brett? ",

Now, you kids are pretty young, but I'm actually a 70, but not the kind that you might think.  Back in my day, we had 70s in the local wards.  And I was set apart at the 70, probably back before you kids were even born.  And I presume I still am a 70.  Now they've got us meeting in a priesthood meeting with these young kids still wet behind their ears.  But I have no control over that.  But what I do have control over is how I live the gospel.  And I know, for example, that when my dear wife passed away, 17 years ago, I knew that if I were to remarry, which I did, and be sealed to my new bride in the temple, in the house of the Lord, I knew that because of the true and everlasting covenant of eternal marriage, that I would have ",
