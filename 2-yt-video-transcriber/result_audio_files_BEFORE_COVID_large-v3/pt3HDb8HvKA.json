            "text": "When God began to lay on my heart in 2004 that I needed to address what was happening in terms of gay activism in society, this is 2004, all right?  I quickly saw that those who came out of the closet fighting for what they said would be their rights for equality in their mind, treat us the way others are treated, let us show affection in public without being ostracized, let our relationships be recognized the way others are, understand their point of view, where they're coming from, although I've never walked in their shoes.  So as they came out of the closet, there was an agenda, though, that went beyond equality and tolerance.  And as I began to speak 15 years ago, those who came out of the closet want to put us in the closet.  There is a real frontal assault on our freedom of religion, speech, and conscience.  And I already recognize 15 years ago, and I was greatly helped by books like Alan Sears and Craig Austin, The Homosexual Agenda.  I already saw 15 years ago that LGB activism, which became LGBT and beyond activism, was that principal threat.  So let me take you into California.  So you know exactly what is currently happening now.  All right?  Going to California, I wrote this article, Why California Pastors Must Stand Up to Government Tyranny.  All right?  If you haven't read that article, it's on our website.  It's on stream.  Post it elsewhere.  Why California Pastors Must Stand Up to Government Tyranny.  And I said that California... wants to tell pastors what they can and cannot say in their preaching and teaching regarding gay relations, Gay identity, transgender identity.  There was a Christian young man on Twitter who respectfully challenged me and said, I don't think that's what the bill says.  He said, it's not what the bill says.  You're going beyond what the bill says.  So I said, all right, here are links.  Here's a commentary on the bill from a legal society in California.  And he still challenged what I was saying.  He's like, here it is, friend.  I can't go beyond telling you what's there.  But The fact that this would even be discussed, the fact that anyone would even think it's possible for the state to tell Christian leaders what they can and can't say or should or shouldn't say is utterly outrageous.  So I want to go through the bill with you.  This has been proposed, and the proposal was accepted, so it is in motion.  Now, it could have been stopped right out of the gate, but it's in motion.  Last year, there was a bill that got tabled last minute, AB 2943, and that bill would have made it illegal for anyone of any age in California with unwanted same-sex attraction or gender identity confusion to get professional help to help them resolve those issues.  It's illegal in California and 15 other states right now if you're a minor.  This is complete outrage.  It's illegal for a minor to get professional counseling help if that person has unwanted same-sex attraction.  They're 17 years old.  Let's say they were raped and abused earlier.  They find themselves confused about their sexual desires.  They want to be attracted to the opposite sex, but find themselves attracted to the same sex.  They want to get clinical help.  They want to sit with a professional counselor.  The parents say, let's do it.  Illegal!  In California, in 15 states, for a minor to do it, that's already an outrage and it's being fought now from state to state.  But California wanted to make it illegal for everyone of any age.  Yet now, something even more nefarious.  So let's take a look at this.  lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people, okay?  This measure would call upon all Californians to embrace the individual and social benefits of family and community acceptance.  upon religious leaders to counsel on LGBTQ matters from a place of love, compassion, and knowledge of the psychological and other harms of conversion therapy, and upon the people of California and institutes of California with great moral influence to model equitable treatment of all people of the state.  You say, well, that sounds innocent.  Oh, oh, this is anything but innocent.  Number one, Everyone must agree that, quote, conversion therapy, all right, conversion therapy is harmful.  What does that mean?  Helping someone with same-sex attraction or unwanted gender identity disorder find wholeness, find help, find change.  So anything saying, yeah, through counseling, through the gospel, we can help you change from homosexual to heterosexual.  We can help you get set free from some of these desires.  You must recognize that as harmful.  Okay?  And then you must have a model of equitable treatment of all people of the state, which means that if a boy identifies as a girl, then you need to support that boy's female identity and support that boy's, quote, right to use the female restroom at school and play on the girl's sports team, so on and so forth.  Okay.  Whereas the California state legislature has found that that being gay, bisexual, or transgender is not a disease, disorder, illness, deficiency, or shortcoming.  So this is now the foundation on which this bill is being presented.  This is the foundation on which this bill is going forth, that these are the premises, these are the presuppositions.  Everything's built on that, friends.  This is why there's been such a strong outcry to this from Christian leaders.  Whereas major professional associations of mental and physical health recognize that being LGBTQ is part of natural variations that occur in sexual orientation and gender identity and recommend responsive services that foster self-acceptance and skills to cope with social stigma and discrimination.  Whereas practices or therapies that attempt to create a change in a person's sexual orientation or gender identity are often referred to as conversion therapy.  whereas some family, caregivers, and communities provoke conversion therapy when a person is known or thought to be LGBTQ, and whereas California law recognizes that performing conversion therapy on young persons is ineffective, unethical, and harmful, and whereas conversion therapy has been rejected as ineffective, unethical, and harmful by leading medical, mental health, and child welfare organizations in the United States, and whereas the stigma associated with being LGBTQ often created by groups in society, including therapists and religious groups, And.  And.  And.  Whereas in a pluralistic society, people differing along spectrums of political and religious perspectives share a common responsibility of protecting the health and well-being of all children in vulnerable communities.  Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Assembly of the State of California.  and Senate thereof concurring that the legislature calls upon all Californians to embrace the individual and social benefits of family and community acceptance, and be it further resolved that the legislature calls upon religious leaders to counsel on LGBTQ people from a place of love, compassion, knowledge of the psychological and other harms of conversion therapy, and be it further resolved that in addressing the stigma often associated with persons who identify as LGBTQ, Okay.  Okay.  Friends, you understand what this is saying.  If you preach that homosexual practice is sin, that's stigmatizing people.  Can't do that.  If you say that a same-sex, quote, marriage in God's sight is not a real marriage, that's stigmatizing people.  You can't do that.  If you tell the man wearing a dress that wants to be a member of your church that you want this man to embrace his biological identity and you're going to help him do that, that stigmatizes him.  This is what the bill is actually saying, friends.  This is what the bill is mandating.  That's why this bill must be steadfastly resisted.  And that's why pastors, leaders all over California right now, all over America should have done this 10 years ago or longer.  But they should get up on a Sunday morning and give a full and clear and definite message where we stand on homosexual practice and why.  where we stand on transgender issues.  and why, and then preach with love, let the messages be saturated with love, let them be saturated with broken hearts of compassion that care for those that feel that they're outcast and marginalized as if God hates them, proclaim the gospel to all, the blood of Jesus, shed the same for all, a new life in Jesus.  And if the bill passes, then that next week, get up and do it again.  Defy the bill openly.  Obey God rather than man.  Obey God rather than man. ",
