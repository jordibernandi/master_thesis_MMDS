            "text": "All right.  Nasty Nathaniel out here in Hollywood, California.  And joining me is Antelope Valley Watchman.  And together we're going to be doing a First Amendment audit of Eckencar.  The address is 6669 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.  And we're going to make sure that our friends at Eckencar respect and honor our constitutional right to record in public.  So let's go across the street and I'll explain to y'all what Ekencar is all about, or at least the best I can.  Yeah, this is it.  This is the building.  This is Ekencar.  It was founded in 1965 by Paul Twitchell in San Diego, but their current headquarters are in Chanhassen, Minnesota, which is a suburb of the Minneapolis, St.  Paul area.  Me and Pink were recently there.  We took a tour of Paisley Park.  But the current leader is Harold Kemp.  And they have some kind of weird practices.  They believe that you can see past lives and dreams.  But they have some very... similar kind of viewpoints towards the way they treat critics or anyone who speaks against them.  Kind of like Scientology.  Anyone who's critical of them, ex-members that lead, journalists, they can be the subject of some harassment.  Like, for example, when author David Lane wrote his book, Making of a Spiritual Movement, his apartment was actually broken into.  And the Perpetrators didn't take anything of monetary value.  They, you know, like a radio or a TV or anything like that, but they destroyed his research files and actually left an incriminating note saying, no more.  You know, like they didn't want him to write about Eckenpar.  And it's been my, or through information I've been given, they don't like photographers.  Here's the kind of... That's Harold Kemp.  He's the current leader.  And then Paul Twitchell right next to him.  He's the founder.  And they've incorporated like Eastern philosophy into it.  That's the temple of heck.  You know, it's funny, you know, if Pink, if you're watching this, we should have went there when we were in Chanhassen.  When we were visiting Paisley Park, we should have went and visited their headquarters.  That would have been kind of interesting.  Because who knows when the next time I'll be in Chanhassen.  But yeah, this is it.  This is Eckincar.  Oh, it looks like we got some people going in there.  Yeah, we're saying, what are they doing?  I don't know.  i wonder i wonder if they're going to tell on us.  we'll find out this.  um where this building is located?  we got old glory up there.  this is uh the crossroads of the world.  it was built in 1936 and it was considered to be the first outdoor mall.

Crossroads of the World Mall.  I guess you're getting a double feature here.  You're getting the mall.  And see how this is shaped like a boat?  Kind of cool.  Cool.  Here's somebody playing Lionel Richie, they're bumping Lionel Richie on their stereo.  So, let's take a look, might as well explore, since we're here.  Got a U-Haul truck, real exciting stuff.
