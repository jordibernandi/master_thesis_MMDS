            "text": "Welcome back.  This is part of a series dealing with the Friendly Atheists video, 20 Short Arguments Against God's Existence.  Keep in mind, this is supposed to be a reason why you should not believe in God, and this is the next one.  The movies and music that honor God are just awful.  And my first response is, wait a minute.  This is supposed to be a reason to not believe in God.  Like your music is bad.  Your movies are bad.  Therefore God doesn't exist.  Like, is that really the logic and the reasoning of this argument?  I mean, it is, this is an argument against God from bad music and bad movies.  Um, okay.  Um, so if I have good Christian music and good Christian movies, does that mean that God does exist?  Challenge accepted.  I present to you Johann Sebastian Bach.  Bach is one of the most important composers in the history of humanity.  Modern music in a lot of ways is still fashioned after him.  And he did more than just inspire a few Beatles songs, which he did.  He actually helped flesh out the entire major and minor keys that we use in our music today.  Britannica.com puts it this way.  Bach is now generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time.  Bach loved God.  Bach would actually sign all of his music to God committing it to him with the phrase Soli Deo Gloria or glory to God alone.  glory to God alone.  He not only wrote a lot of overtly and outwardly Christian music, but he also likes to embed symbolism of Christianity within his songs.  He liked to use the E flat chord to represent the Trinity.  Scholars actually look at Bach's music just to find all the symbolism related to God and Christ and Christianity that he embedded in his songs.  And he is, of course, considered largely one of the greatest composers of all time.  Should we now consider this evidence for God?  The world is full of art.  that's a result of people using their gifts in a desire to honor and glorify God.  And Bach is just one example.  So, Hemant Mehta's argument against God in this case falls on two counts.  One, it's not factually true.  And two, you can't prove or disprove God's existence by the quality of art in the Christian realm.  Like, this is just weird.  I don't understand this kind of thinking, you guys.  I'm sorry, I'm not with it at all.  But let me add a few more thoughts before I move on to the next question in this series.  A lot of the secular music that you might think of as being godless and secular movies that you would consider really good art, really well done, have Christians behind them, have Christians producing them, Christians making them.  and even their hearts trying to do things that honor God with that art.  This is not that uncommon.  I mean, there aren't that many atheists running everything and producing all the content that's out there.  It's just not the reality of things.  We have believers in God who are producing this stuff all the time, every day.  Now it's true that when you get into the overtly outwardly Christian movies with Christian messages and Christian music with Christian messages, that the market gets a lot smaller.  So the funding is a lot lower and the distribution is a lot less.  But as a guy that used to book Christian bands, I've seen incredibly talented people and seen short artistic films and things like this done from Christians that were incredibly high quality.  There just isn't much of a market, so you don't generally see it floating around out there.  But there are certainly instances of it.  But people tend to have a market more for the less overt content.  Doesn't mean it's not being done for God's glory.  But seriously though, this is an argument against God's existence.  Your art's bad so your God doesn't exist.  Like I don't follow and I don't think that anybody who thinks it through follows either.  The reason why these are 20 short arguments is because the power of them only exists when you string them together and you throw them at someone really fast before they can answer because it leaves the impression of confidence and like certainty.  about your position, but when you analyze them individually, they just fall apart.  And this is often the case with atheist complaints against Christianity or challenges to the existence of God.  The next one in this series is going to be a video that is about a complaint about God being invisible.  That's what it will be about.  I really hope you'll check it out and make sure to check out all the videos in the playlist because me, Cam, and John from Capturing Christianity and from What Do You Meme have worked together to produce this content that it might be a blessing to you.
