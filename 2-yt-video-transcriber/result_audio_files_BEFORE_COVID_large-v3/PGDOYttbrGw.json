            "text": "But in today's video, today's very, very long video, I've never understood when book writers or video creators infer or imply that a lengthy argument is better than a concise one.  We're going to actually prove it.  And so the total amount of time, I think, is around three and a half hours, if you can believe it.  It's a long time.  That is one big pile of shit.  Welcome to PolyGia, where a former Christian takes a look at the claims of Christians.  If you're new to the channel, please take a second to tap on the subscribe button, so that you'll be notified when new science, theology, or news videos come out.  Now, I don't normally take requests on the topics I respond to, but a number of non-Christians and Christians alike have been asking me about a load of historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus with two scholars, which is actually a compilation of five podcast interview episodes.  I've spoken quite a bit about the resurrection of Jesus.  In fact, there's a link to a playlist of me doing so in the description above my head right now.  But in this meandering Irishman-length conversation, there were a few unique takes that I'm up for talking about, one at a time.  So this will be the first in a once-in-a-while series.  Aside from the epic length, the video title promises historical evidence from scholars, whom we come to learn is referencing Callum Miller, a medical doctor, and Max Baker Hitch, a lecturer in philosophy of religion at Wycliffe Hall in Oxford.  It seems to me that neither of these credentials necessarily make Calum or Max any more or less an expert in historical evidence than an evolutionary biologist talking about religion or a photographer talking about philosophy.  Perhaps they have insights, and perhaps they don't.  But their status as scholars in unrelated fields is highly irrelevant here, so I'm not sure why that's in the title.  Throughout the video, Callum struck me as someone who was highly credulous towards any scrap that might remotely support his faith in Jesus' resurrection. ",

And, you know, I think it leads us to think like you're going to certainly going to have to posit something quite significant happening.
