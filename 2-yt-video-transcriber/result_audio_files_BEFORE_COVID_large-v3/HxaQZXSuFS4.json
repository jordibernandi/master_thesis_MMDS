            "text": "We made it.  It's all over.  The Liberals have a minority government with 157 seats.  The Conservatives gained 26 for a total of 121.  Now the Liberals won the election even though they got the smallest share of the popular vote of any minority or majority government ever.  With just under a third of the popular vote, they won nearly half the seats in Parliament.  Now the Conservatives actually got 1% more votes, but won just 36% of the seats.  The result speaks to the clustering of Tory votes in the Prairies, for example, whereas the Liberal vote is more evenly spread across the country.  The Bloc Quebecois also got a boost from Canada's first-past-the-post system.  With just 7.7% of the vote, the Bloc won 8 more seats than the NDP's 24, which itself got twice as many votes.  The Greens got 6.6% of the votes, but only 3 seats, which is less than 1%.  Now, Jody Wilson-Raybould hung on to her seat as an independent while Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada didn't have a single victory anywhere in the country, and Bernier, in fact, lost his seat.  Now, time for the fun part, when parliamentarians get back to work.  The NDP is expected to play a significant role in propping up Trudeau's minority government, but anything could happen, including another election. ",
