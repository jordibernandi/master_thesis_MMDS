            "text": "When Chinese laborers were brought into America in the 1860s to build the dangerous railroads, thousands of Chinese women also came as prostitutes.  Initially, there were mainly independent contractors, but soon, Chinese men realized there was a fortune to be made off of these women.  Soon, Chinatown brothels were filled with women who had been kidnapped or sold by their poor families or enticed by fantasies of marriage, and they often ended up in San Francisco.  Girls were procured in China for around $50 and then sold at auctions for up to $2,800.  They were then said to be exploited for four to six years, though many didn't survive that long because the women were expected to die of disease, drugs, or suicide.  While San Francisco officials looked the other way, the money was then used to invest in Chinese American communities.  Though a number of progressive era women advocated for these brutalized Asian American women, most weren't aware or particularly interested in their struggle.  The realities of early Asian American women here was starkly different to white American prostitutes who usually worked independently or under madams and brothels.  Back in 1859, Dr.  William Sanger studied 2,000 prostitutes on New York's Blackwell Island to investigate their motives.  Half of them had worked as domestic servants, one of the most poorly paid jobs, before entering the sex trade.  Another quarter worked as seamstresses, and the remaining bit were abused and abandoned wives.  This was a trend that continued, in which white women turned to sex work in the face of economic pressure or to escape domestic abuse.  One full-service sex worker told the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison that, Even still, white slavery became a popular media theme.  Tales of white women being snatched from home and forced into sexual servitude by evil minorities galvanized an anti-prostitution movement.  The white slavery panic was in part a way to rationalize all the middle class white girls with good breeding who became prostitutes, and they were a significant number.  While Asian women were actually being abused and exploited, there was and is very little evidence of a white sexual slavery trade in the early 1900s, but it led to 1910's Man Act.
