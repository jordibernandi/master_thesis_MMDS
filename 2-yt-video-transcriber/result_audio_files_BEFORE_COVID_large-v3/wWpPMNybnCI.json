            "text": "Shalom.  I don't know about you, but I love the Feast of Tabernacles and we've got two weeks until we all get together for that wonderful, wonderful feast.  The location we're at this year is amazing.  Like last year, we're at Kellogg Springs Retreats.  What I love about this place is it is a mountain retreat with cabins, and a great congregational area.  Whether you're in an RV, cabins, or a tent site, it's a great place to be.  If you've got young children, it's an opportunity of a lifetime for your children to make connections and make friends.  We've got archery, zipline, climbing, roller skating, and you know what?  When we do those activities, we make sure that they're Bible-centric.  So you've got leadership, you've got spiritual motivation, prayer and supplication.  And for us adults, we get to have teaching, worship, fellowship and evening sessions by the campfire with all kinds of discussions and midrash.  It really is a spiritual, uplifting time.  And that's why Yahuwah designed the feasts and festivals so that we could come together and celebrate his Sabbaths and his holy times and get away from the world.  As for me and my house, I can't wait to just check out of Babylon and get into the wilderness with Yahuwah's people.  If you haven't signed up yet, there are some spots still available.  Follow the description below and you can register now and sign up for the Feast of Tabernacles 2019.  It really is a spiritually uplifting time, a time where you are enriched in your spirit.  I pray that I get to see you.  And those of you that have already signed up, We're nearly there.  Catch me live this Sabbath and again.  Thank you to all of our supporters that make all of this possible.  And because of our donors, we're able to feed you and provide dinner for free at the Feast of Tabernacles this year, which to me... Benevolence is a blessing and we are truly blessed because of your stewardship and you deciding to partner with us here at Torah to the Tribes.  Thank you so much.  Sign up below and I'll catch you on Shabbat.  Shalom. ",
