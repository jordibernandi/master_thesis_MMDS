Got this car parked here.  That cut?  They've got three on the car, and there's a couple more.  I can't talk to them.  What is that?  I love this campus.  It's like.  so on point, man.  I love this campus.  I love this campus.  I love this campus.  I love this campus.  Oh, my God.  Hey, do me a favor.  Hey, do me a favor.  Hey, follow him, though.  Hey, I follow him on YouTube.

Someone called and said this car was parked in the alley.  They were doing drugs and drinking.  Thank you.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.

They just hang out here.  This is worth it.  They're gonna hang out here.  Someone called and said they were doing narcotics in the car.  A couple of beer cans and bottles are in there.  This guy might be going in.  Taking all his jewelry out and everything.  Yeah, and my argument is very common.  When I'm, when I'm looking at you like that, that's, that's the type you are.  oh my gosh.  Looks like the guys in the car are good to go.  Not sure what they're doing with these people.  Cops breaking down the license plate.  I got to follow them though.  Tell me, follow cop one.  You know what I mean?  Cop watch.  What's the matter with these cops nowadays trying to have my life on lock?  Now a young G like myself can't even drive around the block.  They're playing.  take one and pass it around.  Imagine how they gonna act when they're acid in town.  Cop watch to watch how they act on the beat.  Are they violating rights for the crack on the street?  Getting forced to the right.  Of course it's a fight.  Blowing whites on bikes and horses at night.  Now watch your mouth.  That's what I'm telling them.  thugs.  I know a cop doing nine years to selling them drugs.  Found the beer.  glad cause they found him near.  And that's a heavy, heavy load to carry down here.  Wake up in the morning with your chair to go And won't hesitate to leave a letter though You don't know your laws, man, you better know I'm talking local, statewide, and federal.  What's the matter with these cops nowadays?  Trying to have my life on lock.  Now a young G like myself can't even drive around the block.  What's the matter with these cops nowadays?  Trying to have my life on lock?  Now a young G like myself can't even drive around the block. ",
