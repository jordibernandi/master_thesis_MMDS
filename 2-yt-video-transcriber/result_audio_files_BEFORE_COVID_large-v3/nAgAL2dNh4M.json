            "text": "Ed Miliband, do you think Britain is full in terms of immigration?  Yes.  When I was running for the Labour Party leadership, I said that one of the areas where we had got things wrong and needed to change was immigration.  One of the things I've done since I became leader of the Labour Party is understand where we got things wrong in government and change them.  And one of the things we didn't get right was immigration.  We too easily assumed that those who were worrying about immigration were stuck in the past, unrealistic about how things could be different, even prejudiced.  But Britain was experiencing the largest peacetime migration in history.  Low-skill migration has been too high and we need to bring it down.  That means the maximum transitional controls for new countries coming in from Eastern Europe.  It means properly enforcing the minimum wage so people aren't brought here to undercut workers already here.  So it's not prejudiced when people worry about immigration.  It's understandable.  And we were wrong in the past when we dismissed people's concerns.  Millions of people in this country are concerned about immigration.  And if people are concerned about it, The Labour Party I lead is going to be talking about it.  We won't stop until Yarlswood, Brookhouse, Harmondsworth are closed.  I think we've got very high levels of migration.  I think that we do need to try and get those levels of migration down.  You don't think there is a natural limit?  Of course there are limits, but the limits are expressed in the decisions you take year by year.  Well, how many Uyghur migrants are there at the moment?  You're sort of going down a kind of numbers track, like there's a precise number.  that's the right number.  Labour in government will end indefinite immigration detention.  You've got form on false promises on immigration, haven't you?  Your government.  And people's concerns were genuine.  Why didn't we listen more?  Yeah, we got it wrong.  You got it completely wrong.  We got it wrong, yeah.  Many of our public services rely on those that have come to live in this country.  People are being brought into the country to undermine the minimum wage and various other things.  I think they will help to get low-skill migration down. ",
