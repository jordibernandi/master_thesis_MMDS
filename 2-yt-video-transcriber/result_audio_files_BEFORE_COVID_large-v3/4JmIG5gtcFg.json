We're doing a podcast together.  It's called the Queer Movie Podcast.  It's basically us exploring, talking about, dissecting the best and the worst of LGBTQ plus cinema, one genre at a time.  So the trailer and the first three episodes are already out.  Just search for Queer Movie Podcast wherever you listen to podcasts.  And if you would like to follow us on Twitter, where you can actually vote for the films that we're going to cover in the podcast, then I'll leave a link below.  If you like what you listen to, then please rate and review.  It is extremely important for new podcasts in terms of search rankings and also potentially, you know, getting sponsors involved.  If they see people like it, just gonna say.  And as Jazza just said to me, we're millennials who need external validation, so I guess also that.  And another way to support the podcast, because obviously at the moment we're having to pay for it out of pocket, is to maybe join us on Patreon.  I'm gonna leave a link below.  It just means that we're gonna be able to make episodes, and we're gonna have some really cool perks and tiers there as well.  This is gonna be a monthly podcast, but we are gonna try and do some extra episodes, so if you have any ideas of stuff that you would like to see in little mini episodes, leave them in the comments below.  Cool.  And on with the listicle.  So what we have done is we've written a list.  Each of us have written our top five LGBT films.  What we're going to do is go through one at a time backwards and forwards and we're each going to have 30 seconds to sell the other and you on the films that we've chosen.  So let's get started.  Jazza, would you like to go first? ",
