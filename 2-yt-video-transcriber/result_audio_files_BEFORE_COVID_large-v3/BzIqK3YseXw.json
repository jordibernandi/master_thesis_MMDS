I'm sorry?  But you're blocking the sidewalk.  And you're blocking the handicap ramp.  Huh?  But this is a handicap ramp.  No, it ain't.  This is a public sidewalk.  What's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name and badge number?  What's your name and badge number?  Chavio, what's your badge number?  Who do you work for?  Kirby Police Department?  Okay.  You're blocking a handicap ramp right here, and you're on a public sidewalk.  No, it ain't.  This is a public sidewalk, asshole.  I'm not going to have a good day.  Don't put my license plate on your thing.  It's too late.  You can take my picture all you want, but don't put my license plate on it.  I got it already.  I'm streaming live to YouTube, asshole.  That's fine.  You don't have to put my license plate on the thing on YouTube.  It's on YouTube right now.  Okay.  You're live.  Okay.  Don't act like an asshole.  Don't get all aggressive with me.  I'm not aggressive with you, sir.  I'm just asking you not to move my license plate.  I'm asking you to move your bike and stop blocking the sidewalk.  This is H&E Public.  No, it ain't.  This is a public sidewalk, dumbass.  Okay.  Have a good day.  Get your fucking bike out of here.  Have a good day.  What fucking traffic are you fucking directing?  I'm directing these people out when they need to be directed out.  You're doing it for HEB, but this is a public sidewalk.  This is HEB public.  No, it ain't.  No, it ain't.  This is Universal City public sidewalk, asshole.  All right.  Have a good day.  You don't know the law, asshole.  You're breaking the fucking law right now.  Police.  Hey, somebody call Kirby Police Department right now.  There's 1,650 people watching this right now.  Somebody call Kirby Police Department.  Let them know... This officer right here, look at his face, guys.  Everybody look at this guy's face.  Let him know that he's blocking a handicapped walkway right here and a public sidewalk.  And he's spitting on a sidewalk with his fucking shitty-ass tobacco in his mouth.  This license plate is 227 TC3.  I'm putting the license plate on here, dude.  Look, I'm being nice to you.  No, you're not, dude.  Okay, why don't you just move your bike?  I'm not doing anything for you.  You're breaking the law, okay?  You're breaking the law.  No, it's not.  This is Universal City public property.  Move your motorcycle and I'll leave you alone.  This is H-E-B property.  No, it ain't.  No, it isn't.  Look, you see these telephone poles?  This is public utilities.  Everything on this side of the pole belongs to the city.  H-E-B didn't pour this fucking sidewalk.  Universal City.  This sidewalk was here long before H-E-B was.  I know, because I fucking live here.  Okay.  This is not H-E-B property.  Move your bike, and I'll leave you alone.  You're breaking the law right now.  You're supposed to uphold the law.  Why can't you just park right there?  Okay, I'll park right there.  Okay, if it's going to make you happy, and it's going to shut you the fuck up, I'll move.  All right, move.  Okay.  This thing will shut up.  There's nothing better to be here.  You got nothing better to do.  I am out with my family.  This is my job right here.  Keeping you fucking thugs accountable.  We think you're above the law.  I'm gonna check back up on you in a little while. ",
