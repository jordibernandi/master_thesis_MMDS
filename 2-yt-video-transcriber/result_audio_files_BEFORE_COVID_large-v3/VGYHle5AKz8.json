            "text": "Started the new book.  New book.  It's going to rip apart the millennials.  Aaron, have the millennials been picked on enough?  Not enough.  Not officially.  Not when this will be the epitomal book that defines the millennial generation.  And it's sad because, wait, Aaron, the millennials aren't dead yet.  They might as well be.  They might as well because in addition to just failing to launch, in addition to being the most fucked up generation ever, yes, worse than the baby boomers, admittedly, though, did not have everything handed to them like the baby boomers.  I'll grant you that.  They were spoiled in other regards.  But they are not only such a spectacular failure, there's no way they're going to recoup.  There's never going to be... a true critical assessment of themselves.  They're never going to have to come to Jesus meeting because they're too arrogant.  They're too cocky.  They think themselves too smart.  And so it's kind of like an AIDS and autoimmune deficient.  They're incapable of admitting they're wrong.  And therefore we'll never get back on the path towards success.  They will.  They, in other words, it doesn't matter that millennials are in what the mid thirties now, or if they're in the mid seventies, it's going to be the same position.  They're like the 60s feminists.  They're never going to admit they're wrong.  They're going to double down, double down, double down because their ego and pride won't take the fact to admit they were wrong.  They were duped.  They're not independent-minded.  They were the easiest, most succorable-est, sheeple-est people ever.  Ever.  And again, a brilliant, brilliant tactic on the left, I gotta, you gotta admit when the left is masterful at something, is to implant that kind of autoimmune deficiency in terms of people's thinking so they can never be truly critical thinking.  In other words, like, look, how brilliant is it that the left got feminist, environmentalist, millennials, and Gen X too, To say, I am smart.  I are smart.  I are independent-minded.  To get them to say they're independent-minded when they all parrot the exact same shit.  They all vote Democrat and they all spew the same shit.  I'm independent-minded and all you millennials wear salmon-colored jeans.  The hipsters is the epitome of this.  We're so smart.  We're so independent.  We're so unique.  It's like you all look the exact... The fucking Romans couldn't make more of a standardized group of people with a uniform.  if they tried all look like you came off an assembly line.  There's more variety in color to the Ford Focuses being mass produced off of the Mexican factory because at least some of those have different colors.  You guys are all the fucking same and you have that intellectual, psychological, mental aids for the brain where you're just not capable of saying, yes, you're right, we're wrong, and now I got to figure it out.  So now I can write a book about millennials because you're not going to change.  It's done.  It's dry.  Unless you guys had some kind of World War II, like you went through a Great Depression.  We're going to print off enough money so that doesn't happen and the rest of the world ain't going to get its shit together so the U.S.  dollar won't ever collapse.  You guys are so fucking lucky that the rest of the world, all the other producing economies are more corrupt than the United States.  You're so lucky because that's basically how we're going to bail you out of your student loans.  And I know because the millennials are so smart and intelligent, they can make the connection between them not paying their student loans and that not having any effect because China is horrendously corrupt.  I'm sure you guys are so educated in economics and finance, you can make that connection.  But they're going to stagnate.  That's it.  They're not going to stay.  They have stagnated.  There's nothing else.  Your life is over.  Your generation is over.  35 years old.  On the old end, it's over.  Put a fork in it.  You're done.  You're not going to achieve anything else.  You're going to be like the 60s feminists.  You're going to repeat the same old broken record.  Repeat the same old shit.  You're going to have your avocado and toast paying $6.  You're going to drink your espresso.  You're going to virtue signal.  You're going to be tiring.  You're going to be boring.  You're done.  Society shouldn't pay any more attention to you.  I mean, now Gen Z is coming online.  You're no longer the youngest and the sexiest.  All the attention is going to go there.  That might fucking put some sands in your millennial vaginas.  That's all right.  You could be upset.  You can write poetry about how it makes you feel bad.  You can curl your beards a little bit more.  Whatever the fuck you do.  But it's over.  You're not doing anything.  It's done.  You're not going to put a man on a moon.  You're not going to fight off Nazism.  Oh, you think you're fighting Nazism because Trump is Hitler.  Exactly my point.  You think Antifa is anti-fascist.  Oh, oh, how brainwashed and duped you guys are.  What was it?  Hang on.  Let me look this up.  I didn't intend on slamming on the millennials, but you know.  Like a doggy kick, which I've never kicked a dog.  Ah, millennials, not no Holocaust.  Yeah, here it is, even though this is about a year old.  From the Washington Post Holocaust study, two-thirds of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is.  You guys don't even know what Nazism is, and you claim everybody's a fucking Nazi.  Someone who disagrees with me, Nazi.  You even know what Nazism was?  I don't have to read, I guess.  Two-thirds of American millennials surveyed in a recent poll cannot identify what our choice is.  And you think you're so smart.  You think you're so educated.  It's like.  I don't even know what it's like.  It's like you're the court jesters of society, but at least the court jester knew he was the court jester.  You know, he knew he was making fun.  You don't even know you're the butt end of jokes.  Your heads are so far up your own goddamn asses.  You don't even know that you're the butt end of jokes and how fucking utterly pathetic you guys are as a generation.  Now, admittedly, again, yes, I have to mention this before because I think this deserves it.  Usually, you know, I'll make a generalization, and I won't bother saying not all women are like that.  But here I will make a caveat or an exception because for you to be a truly independent-minded millennial, which is pretty much all my listeners right here, that does take balls.  And that should deserve a hat tip and a footnote like, yes, not all millennials are like that.  I'll grant you that.  And there's some great and fine outstanding millennials.  But my, you know, the third of you who know what Auschwitz is.  And I feel bad for you guys, for the good millennials.  I feel so bad for you guys.  You know, like you're the Vietnam vets of the baby boomer generation.  Like, well, we're the 10% that actually fucking did some work.  No, wait, we're not.  And it's like, yeah, I know.  I know.  You know, it's like the black tax of poor black guys pay when they go, oh, you're black.  Well, we're going to assume you're just like all the other black.  And then it's not fair.  It's not.  I understand.  And so I will always provide that that caveat, because for you guys to be to shuck that brainwashing, to shuck the trillions of dollars spent on just making your generation just the slaves that you are.  And you came out not being.  you don't have to be a Republican.  You just have to not be a leftist.  You just have to, like, not have a tattoo.  You just have to not be obese and be pretty.  You just have to make a guy a dinner and not think it's beneath you.  You just have to not hate men.  And you're the top 5% of millennials.  But it takes a lot of true independent thought to get there.  But as for the remaining 90% of your generation, I am going to so fucking violate the hell out of them.  I'm not going to do anything.  I'm merely going to point things out.  I'm merely going to compile statistics and data and then draw some very, very easy conclusions and observations from it.  Your generation, I know it's not your generation, that generation, those guys over there, Heck, that's right.  Didn't I do an honorary?  There was a millennial.  I remember we had, I still got the scrolls and the hat and everything.  There was a millennial who wanted to apply to become part of Gen X. I remember this now.  And I went to the Michael's Fabrics and I got some shiny paper and a big red X. And I made kind of like a Pope looking outfit.  And I got a scroll and I ordained him an official member of Gen X. Look that up.  Honorary member of Gen X. I think that's what it was.  So you guys could apply.  You could apply to Gen X if you have a job.  You didn't vote for Barack Obama.  You got a real degree.  You do not belong in the millennial generation.  You belong in Gen X. So if you want, I could go ahead and officially ordain you with my Pope Gen X hat, part of Gen X. Do I even have to go through this?  A recent study released on Holocaust Remembrance Day found that the knowledge of the genocide that killed 6 million Jews during World War II is not robust among American adults.  22% of millennials in the polls said they never even heard of the Holocaust.  Oh my God!  One-fifth of you have never even heard of it.  If you've never heard of the Holocaust, do you even know what state you're in?  If you had a map of the United States, are you that dumb?  Would you even know?  Hey, I'm in Alabama.  Okay, point to Alabama.  They're pointing at Montana or something like that.  The study conducted by the Conference on Jewish Materials Claims Against Germany interviewed 1,350 American adults in February.  All right, now I got a question.  Did they bias it that way to make it seem like they're victims and there's not enough awareness of the Holocaust?  Asked to identify what Auschwitz is, 41% of respondents and 66% of millennials could not come up with a correct response identifying it as a concentration camp or extermination camp.  Isn't it a nice beachside resort over in Italy?  The U.S.  Holocaust Memorial says that at least 1.3 million were deported to the camp run by Nazi Germany and occupied Poland from 1940 to 1945.  1.1 million of them were killed.  Was, oh, wait, 1.3 million.  Oh, wow.  I know there's Dachau and a couple others.  I did not know that Auschwitz had over a million people killed there.  Holy processing plant, man.  Oh, that's just horrible.  Roger's concentration camp, among many built by the Nazis during their campaign to wipe out the Jews and other groups.  Residents indicated how much more awareness of modern-day Bides against Jews.  See, this is where I'm wondering, with 68% saying anti-Semitism is present in America today.  Okay, I got another question.  Do you millennials even know what Semite is?  Do you know that it's synonymous, means Jewish?  Do you know that?  Or did they just hear, do you think there's anti-Semitism?  And all they heard was the anti-ism.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's lots of that, yeah.  I are educated.  I have a degree in sociology.  I are so smart, I have a master's in communications.  Reminds me of that bear from Bugs Bunny.  Dad, father! ",
