            "text": "So today's entire video is all for you, Mama Saint.  Get well soon.  Well, it's really nice to meet you anyway.  Oh, sorry, you just caught me.  I'm just about to start with my self-help group.  It's like Alcoholics Anonymous, but for people that don't believe in the heliocentric model.  Okay, so can you tell me your name, please?  Hello, everyone.  My name's Shahzad Mukti.  Hi, Shazwa.  That's some beautiful hair you've got.  Oh, thank you very much.  I like yours too.  It's really nice.  No, I wasn't talking to you.  It's not your turn yet.  Shazwa, tell us why you're here.  I know the Earth is a flat, motionless plane and definitely not a rotating, revolving world planet.  Okay, Shazva, I think I'm beginning to understand.  Now, I believe that this stems from a deep-rooted disbelief in the proven force of gravity.  Can you please tell me what makes you believe gravity isn't real?  Wow, that was incredible.  Del, how high can you jump?  A thousand feet.  Why does he always have to spoil it by telling lies?  What's wrong with you, man?  Sorry.  It's alright, pal.  I forgive you.  Now, Shazbar, can you tell me, what else makes you think gravity isn't real?  Hmm, right.  I understand.  Let me see if I can fix that for you.  Oh, I can do stuff like that now.  I've got a new computer.  Okay, so what else makes you think gravity is not real?  Okay, Shazwa, as I understand it, your inability to comprehend even the most simple primary school science has led you to develop a condition that I like to call droppity.  Now, it starts off simply enough with the urge to just drop something in water in an effort to explain gravity away as just density and buoyancy.  But then from there, things just escalate and you feel the need to drop something else.  And sooner or later, unfortunately, you find you can't stop.  You're out of control.  And when you realize you've got a problem and you really want to stop, you just say to yourself, just one more.  Well, I'm pleased to announce, after some intensive work and science lessons with myself, Shazvar has now cleaned himself up, he's found a new haircut, and he no longer feels the urge to drop anything.  Bollocks.  Well, I guess you win some and you lose some.  Anyway, let's see what's on Globe Denier TV. ",

            "text": "Amazing.  Now, on a more serious note, if you are somebody who's still claiming that balloons floating in the air somehow disprove gravity, then A, you're either lying and you're a troll, or B, you really are one of the vulnerable people that needs help and guiding away from nonsense like Flat Earth.  So let's put this straight.  Question one.  Why do things fall downwards?  Yeah, boys, what I mean is, if gravity doesn't exist, and it's all down to density and buoyancy, then any object I hold has a less dense medium above it than below it.  So why doesn't it fall upwards?  Or why doesn't it fall to the sides?  Okay, let me put it another way.  When objects fall, they accelerate, but they accelerate into a medium that becomes more dense.  Now, if you're claiming that density and buoyancy are the reason things fall, then surely when something falls and it moves into the denser, it should actually start to slow down, not speed up until it hits a terminal velocity.  Why is that?  Give me two seconds.  Right.  And if floating and sinking is purely due just to differences in density and nothing else, why does a ship, which floats because it's less dense than water, have some of its mass underneath the surface of the water?  Gav, what are the chances that I will ever get a sensible answer from any of you lot on any of those questions?  Totally impossible.  Like... Why am I not surprised?  Now it's time for this. ",

But sorry, I seem a bit distracted.  Can you stop playing with your balls?  Thank you.  Right.  Now, this has been a very short video.  All I can say is I will be back within the next 24 hours with a comments video.  And in that video, Paquette Word will be sitting the Conspiratard quiz.  Let's see if we can knock Daniel Pratt off the top.  Do you think he can, pal?  Yes.  That's the spirit, pal.  Now, I will see you all very, very soon.  Or even sooner if you choose to click that link in the description to learn about the Coriolis effect.  It will be boring.  but may be informative if you don't know what the Coriolis Effect is.  And for one last time, Mumma's saying, get better soon. ",
