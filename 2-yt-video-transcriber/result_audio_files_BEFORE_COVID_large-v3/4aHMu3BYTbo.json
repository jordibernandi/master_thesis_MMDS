Yeah, you know exactly what I mean.  They stab you in the back and then they ask why you're bleeding.  I don't trust words.  I trust action.  I don't care what you heard.  I'm not slacking.  My name's Allen Roberts.  This is Everyday Update Fitness.  Like, subscribe, click the notification button right over here and share my videos.  Subscribe to my second channel, Allen Roberts, and my opinion course can be linked above and below at the end in all those places.  And that's actually the channel that I was going to make a video on about this topic.  because recently some guy that's had a YouTube channel for like 10 years, got like 10,000 subscribers, with no visible or searchable qualifications came out and made a video saying that Jeff Cavaliere from Athlean-X is not a strength coach.  And now the guy is really, really, really strong, Can't show that he's actually coached anybody, trained anybody, anything like that, of any significance at least.  And if you are a professional athlete or a college-level athlete who has been a coach of this young guy, I believe his name's Alex, if he's coached you to become incredibly strong, please do announce yourself in the comments section below.  I'm sure a bunch of people want to say hi.  But he made a video stating that Jeff is not a strength coach, and I find that shit laughable.  Just like when most, you know, people with absolutely no fucking qualifications, you know, pretty much come out and say, you know, Jeff is this, Jeff is that, blah, blah, blah, all the stupid shit.  I get a kick out of it because people do know, in case you're new to the channel, that Jeff and I are friends.  I've spoken at his event, Athletics Live, which you should go to, motherfuckers.  You should go to Stanford, Connecticut, end of July.  You guys should go to that fucking thing.  Tickets are still available.  And I've been a speaker there the last two years.  And this year, both my wife and I are speaking.  Because my wife is a highly certified yoga instructor, everything like that, too.  Personal trainer, group instructor.  My wife's... Anyway.  But... So we are friends, so you'll always kind of leave it alone because people are going to assume bias, and I did basically dismantle a channel for basically copying Jeff's work and then using it as their own, what's up Vince, how the fuck you doing?  Hope things are going good, bitch.  But I wasn't going to really do a video on this for the big channel because it's laughable.  Unless the New York Mets all of a sudden come out and say Jeff Cavalier's been lying on his resume stating he was a strength coach for us and for a Major League Baseball team.  And all of the footage of him being announced as their strength coach has been doctored.  And the NCSA announces that his CSCS certification to them is completely, you know, he's lying about that shit too.  Unless those two things happen, Jeff's a fucking strength coach.  It's hilarious.  And I mean hilarious for people to say he's not.  I laughed... hysterically.  And then I watched the kid's video and the kid's either dumb or fucking, dumb or liar.  You know, he really is.  So I was going to make a video for my small channel about it.  And then James, my friend from Trended Sports Science, which if you aren't subscribed to Trended Sports Science, go to that channel when you're done watching this, motherfuckers.  Go to that channel and subscribe and watch his videos.  James is like, he's like me.  in that we're bald.  But besides that, he's much, much, much smarter, much, much, much calmer, gives much, much better information, and is also funny, probably funnier than me too.  So he's just, we're just bald.  That's how we're like.  Fuckin' whatever.  But the one thing I am that he is not is I am to be kind of blunt.  I've known for that and James is the most polite.  James made a video on this talking about how, you know, attacking AthleanX for a living.  A little play off my company to be AthleanX for a living too, motherfucker.  I see that, James.  Anyway, that's why I'm making this video.  Anyway, what's up, motherfucker?  He made that video and it was just a fucking decimation of the kid's original video, the Athletic System of Strength video.  It is a fucking total ass destruction for the kid.  It is.  James is an actual sports scientist, just so people understand.  He works with athletes.  He is very fucking qualified.  And one of the smarter motherfuckers you're going to find on YouTube, just to be honest.  It always goes to what I say.  James' channel, for right now, has like 50-some thousand subscribers.  But, you know, you don't need to be super, super, super popular to be correct.  And James has information to back up everything like that.  Fucking super smart.  Anyway, go subscribe to his channel.  Watch all his fucking videos.  When you're done watching this, motherfuckers, it'll be linked above and below.  And at the end, thank you very much.  So, I thought it would be funny.  Since he's so polite when he rips this motherfucker apart.  He's so polite.  I thought it'd be funny to do what in my mind I think the anger translation would be for what James is thinking and saying.  So here we go. ",
