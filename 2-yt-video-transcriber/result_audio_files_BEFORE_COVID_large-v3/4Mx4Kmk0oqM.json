            "text": "I don't know if you've noticed, but Christians are all over the place.  Not physically, though they are.  I mean philosophically, theologically.  There's a person who comments frequently on these videos who's certain he knows what the one true Christianity is.  Of course, millions of other Christians will disagree.  It's not just Christianity, though.  Judaism has three main branches, Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform as well.  Years ago, I bought a book called The Bible Tells Me So.  The book demonstrates how the Bible has been used to advocate a given position and its antithesis.  It does this by taking actual arguments made by Christians throughout history, advocating one position and its opposite, both based on the Bible.  pro-slavery, anti-slavery, pro-equal rights for women, anti-equal rights for women.  On the cover of the book is that great quote from Shakespeare, even the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.  From the point of view of someone who has embraced a particular side of an issue based on Scripture, those opposed will no doubt be seen as led astray by Satan himself.  or herself if you're a Mr.  Deity fan.  When atheists like myself quote scripture, believers frequently tell us that the scriptures need to be interpreted properly, suggesting we need some higher learning in order to understand things.  The problem is, in every case, I can point to a group of Christians who interpret the Bible in exactly the same way.  Are they wrong too?  Because I'm sure they'd say those opposed to their interpretation are the ones deceived by the Dark Lord.  As the book demonstrates, every interpretation of Scripture has its opponents and detractors.  Worse yet, there is no objective way to determine who's right.  The Bible itself neither suggests a need for interpretation, who exactly is allowed to do that, nor does it provide a reliable methodology which, if followed, will keep Christians on the straight and narrow.  And even if it did, I'm sure there would be some Christians who would argue that some other group of Christians aren't following directions properly.  At which point they'd both yell out heretic and begin slaughtering each other.  At least that's what they did 400 years ago.  In essence, the Bible is nothing more than a big wordy Rorschach test, revealing more about the reader than the book itself.  If it can be used to argue, as it has throughout history, each side of every issue, it's clear that the reader is simply projecting his or her biases and desires onto the text.  finding whatever one wants, heeding this verse over that for no other reason than their own subjective preferences.  And let me tell you something, some of the people doing that have black, black hearts.  It also becomes clear that even if the Bible contained the actual will of God, and there's no evidence to suggest that, people would still simply interpret it to their liking.  One can imagine the scribes who translated and copied the ancient text doing the same.  You can bet that some scribe didn't like this or that idea and simply left it out.  What does all of this mean?  Well, clearly, no one should give a shit about what the Bible says.  I'm me.  Thanks for watching.  Hi, I'm Brian Dalton.  You may know me from my role as the wacky Mr.  Deity here on YouTube.  But at the end of the day, my favorite role is that of an educator.  Like you, I'm concerned about the declining level of education in this country.  And nowhere is that more evident than among the religious.  So I'm doing something about it.  In study after study, scientists have discovered that nothing is more associated with intelligence, happiness, health, and honesty.  as You guessed it, swearing.  Which is why today I'm announcing Pollute Flicks.  Think of Pollute Flicks as a Netflix for motherfuckers who know the value of a really good asshole or cocksucker.  How are we dong this?  Doing this?  Well, first off, we're focusing all of our goddamn attention on those shitbags who need it most, the uber-religious.  We're taking some of those fucked-up Christian films from the last few years and adding swearing, cursing, obscene hand gestures, and, where inappropriate, full frontal nudity.  If Christians will just give us a fair suck of the salve, we're confident they'll be able to see how they've been getting buggered all these years by these hypocritical wankers and twats.  And if you haven't picked up on it already, yes, we're planning international versions for our friends in Great Britain and Australia.  Hell, if we can raise enough money, we're also planning our own versions of the New Fucking Testament and the Titty Suck Torah.  I shit you not.  How can you help?  Go to patreon.com forward slash Mr.  Deity.  The link is in the description below.  and become a patron, dickwads.  Even $1 per video will help us bring these ignorant fucktwits out of the darkness.  Think of how good we'll all feel when these brainwashed tightasses lighten up.  You'll be proud to say, holy jumping fucking Jesus, I was a part of that.  So help me launch Polluteflix and save this country from another goddamn God-caused dark ages.  If we don't, if we let this shitstorm continue, we all might as well bend over and pick up the soap.  And I'm talking no lubricant of any kind.  It will not be pleasant.  Polluteflix for motherfuckers who know the value of a really good asshole. ",
