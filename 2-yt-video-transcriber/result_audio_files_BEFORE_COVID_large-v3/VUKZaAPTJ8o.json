Do you think it's okay to set banners on fire?  I think people can do whatever the fuck they want.  So there's no moral right or wrong?  I think people can do whatever the fuck they want.  They can have an abortion.  They can fight five people in the night.  They can come and listen to your speech, and they can still have questions for you.  And you can set banners on fire, and that's fine.  People can do whatever the fuck they want to do.  So do you believe that there's a moral right and wrong?  I can say it one more time to the people outside.  I can do whatever the fuck they want to do.  So she doesn't believe in right or wrong.  That's actually very scary society, because there are rights and there are wrongs.  And you can't be like, I can do whatever the fuck I want to do, because that's actually a very, very scary situation.  Because if I wanted to go out and murder people or commit an act of genocide, I shouldn't have the right to do whatever the fuck I want to do.  Next question. ",
