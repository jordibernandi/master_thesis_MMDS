            "text": "Hey there internet, my name's Luxander, and today I want to talk to you about the term androgyny and the problems that it has.  It's entirely possible that most people who watch me haven't given as much thought as I have to the term androgyny or androgynous and what those words mean, both as far as the dictionary and the root of the word, and then like how it's used in culture and particularly with how we describe how trans people look.  People describe me as androgynous a lot, which means that I have a lot of experience with the term, as well as a lot of feelings about how it is applied.  I'm normally not someone who tries to argue from the dictionary definition of a word.  I don't think that's very useful.  Sometimes you are arguing about the definition of a word, which is actually a scientific term that's used in a different way, such as the word theory.  But in this case, I do want to at least try to talk about what the definition of androgyny is, so that we have an idea of where we are at to start with.  When you type in define androgynous into the Google thing, this is what it tells you.  It's an adjective meaning partly male and partly female in appearance or of indeterminate sex.  I'm gonna go ahead and treat those as two different ways to define this word, because I think that they mean two very different things.  The first part of that definition, partly male and partly female in appearance, is what I think the word should be used as.  I took an etymology class as a requirement when I was in high school, and this is one of the words that we looked at because it has andro and gyno, which is man and woman in Greek, and so this word means, etymologically, possessing qualities of maleness and femaleness.  However, I don't think that that's what people usually mean when they use the word androgynous.  I think that most of the time when people use the word androgynous, they are using that second definition, which means of indeterminate sex, which is like, I look at you and I can't tell if you're male or female or if you are a trans woman or a trans man, I can't tell where you started, I can't tell where you're at.  Gender neutral, almost, is how I would sort of translate that into a shorter little condensed thing.  I think that most of the time people say you look androgynous to mean you look functionally gender neutral, you look like I can't guess where you're at.  When people describe me as androgynous, from what I can tell, I take that to mean I am gender ambiguous, it is of indeterminate sex, it is hard to tell where I am or where I started or any of that stuff.  I think that is what people mean when they tell me that I am androgynous.  And I don't necessarily dislike the intent of that description, and here's the thing, is that I don't try to look androgynous.  So here we're kind of getting into what my sticking point is with the term androgynous.  I think that people conflate the concept of androgyny with soft mask.  People tell me that I look androgynous.  That is not what I'm going for most of the time.  What I actually try to do with my appearance is to skew masculine.  It just so happens that I still have these features, and I have this hair that I'm trying to grow, and I have a very slim build in which I don't have very much muscle stacked, and even if I did have a lot of muscle, it would be more lean, and I would still be a small, framed person.  So because of these physical things that I have very limited control over, things which are somewhat feminine about my appearance, if you take that and throw in very, very masculine clothing with no attempt to bring femininity into my presentation, and that gets labeled androgynous.  The very first time I had an issue with this where I felt like that was a word being used incorrectly to describe me or that I found it very annoying was I used to have long hair?  like all of it?  it was all.  all of it was long and I got it cut.  it was down to like here or whatever and I got it cut to being like this short and I posted a picture in one of the trans groups that I was in I don't even think I'm in that group anymore don't know which one it was and people were like oh wow so androgynous.  and I was like.  I just got a boy haircut.  Androgyny is not the point here.  Masculinity is the point here.  Androgyny is not masculinity.  I wanna go ahead and just try to draw up a couple of examples here.  in terms of my own presentation, what I think the difference is between me being a nonbinary person with a masculine presentation, which is called androgyny, versus time in my life when I have actually attempted to produce androgyny as I understand it being a mixture of maleness and femaleness.  Here's a picture from Easter, okay, so we have me with my hair in this little top knot and the top knot is arguably inherently androgynous, we'll get to that in a second, but I'm wearing a button-down shirt and cargo shorts and everything about my presentation is masculine, with the exception of perhaps my features being somewhat feminine and the top part of my hair being somewhat longer.  I don't consider that presentation to be androgynous, I consider that presentation to be masculine and I dislike it when my masculine presentation is labeled as androgyny because that's not what I'm doing.  and I don't think that we should have soft mask being what we consider to be androgyny because the second you throw in something slightly feminine, then it's feminine and no longer androgynous when androgyny is supposed to be the combination of these two things.  So for an example of that, here is a picture of me from before a concert that I went to.  I am wearing a button-down flannel that's open with a t-shirt underneath, wearing my binder, and wearing a skirt and leggings underneath the skirt.  This is definitionally androgynous because I am mixing elements of femininity and masculinity as they are defined by the culture that we live in.  I wanna jump back to the example of my hair, because I think that this is actually a perfect example of what the definition of androgyny is and how the word should be used.  Possessing both maleness and femaleness, okay?  And again, I'm using society's definitions of what masculinity and femininity are and how they can be expressed and blah blah blah.  So, my hair, okay?  I have the sides shaved.  This over here is what society considers to be masculine hair, okay?  This part, the part where I'm growing my hair out and the part where I have a ponytail, some people would say, that having a ponytail or having long hair is considered to be feminine.  Actually, again, with my intentions here, my intention is to be masculine.  Like, I like the top knot.  It reminds me of Sokka from Avatar The Last Airbender, and every time I think about it, I'm like, this is my warrior's top knot.  This is not meant to be androgynous, it just happens to be a good way for me to describe what I think androgyny is, which is that I am.  I want to grow my hair out but I can't because then I'll look like a girl.  so I'm growing out the top of my hair and I'll have a top knot because this is somewhat more masculine leaning on an androgyny scale.  I think part of the problem with the term androgyny and the concept androgyny in the society that we live in is that maleness is default and that even in our trying to break down the binary concept included in the binary concept is the idea that maleness is default, we are still unable to fully break out of this, because this, me wearing, I'm wearing a t-shirt and basketball shorts, from where I am, this presentation is masculine, and to be told that it is androgynous is really invalidating, because it just means to me that any attempts at masculinity that I endeavor on are going to be perceived as cute, almost.  Like, oh, that's soft mask, that's androgynous, that's cute, because of the fact that I, for example, don't really grow very much facial hair.  If I grew facial hair, would I suddenly not be considered androgynous unless I specifically implemented feminine aspects into my gender presentation?  And I have an issue with this also because I am very deeply insecure about some things, like about expressing femininity.  I wish I could paint my nails because I see cis boys doing it.  I don't think I can do it without that being yet another thing.  When people are tallying up boy column, girl column, they will just assume that I am a girl with painted nails as opposed to non-binary masculine person who's painting their nails.  I want to grow my hair out and I cannot.  I am unable to do so because it would compromise my comfort in most other situations.  I find it deeply frustrating to be called androgynous when all I'm trying to do is recreate some kind of soft version of masculinity.  I think people are using this word wrong, and not only are they using the word wrong, but they have it wrong in their heads.  what it means to be gender neutral.  Because soft masculinity is not gender neutrality.  I will say that I don't really have a better working terminology to describe.  If you are trying to compliment someone by saying, wow, you are of indeterminate gender, normally people would use the word androgynous, and I don't.  have a replacement word necessarily for that.  I just think that we need to re-examine how we view masculinity as default, and any amount of femininity as, oh, well, this is a deviation back to feminine, like, that's no longer gender neutral, or, you know, that's no longer androgynous, whereas I believe that to be truly androgynous is to encapsulate both femininity and masculinity simultaneously, and that a person who is attempting to present themselves as masculine as they can in their circumstances is not going to be complemented by the idea that they are androgynous.  Really, it kind of just, it's like more like a hit to their self-esteem because they'll never be masculine enough, apparently, is part of the problem.  So I don't have a replacement term.  if you are trying to compliment someone for how neutral they look, like, oh my god, you look so neutrois.  I would use, maybe I would use neutrois, because that means, it literally means neutral.  And of course, I also just want to reiterate that all of these things are me working within the structure of the society that we live in.  I don't personally consider long hair to be a girl thing or a feminine thing, but society does, so that's me working within the constraints that have been given to me and me trying to express myself relative to these outside terms.  I would absolutely love to hear your thoughts on this, especially if you are a gender non-conforming, non-binary person, like if you find that you want to be more masculine and people are calling it androgynous, or like if you are, someone whose gender expression changes over time and you mix stuff together, like, definitely let me know what your thoughts are, because I want to know if this is just a me problem, or if I'm doing the thing that I hate people do, which is get stuck on the dictionary definition, or in my case, the etymological definition of a word.  I have a lot of feelings about this, and I would appreciate the opportunity to talk about them with you in the comments, so thank you.  That's gonna be all from me today on this rant, though.
