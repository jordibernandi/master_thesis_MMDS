            "text": "Thank you so much for having me.  My name is Courtney.  I know some of you at the back can tell just by the sound of my voice that I don't have hands.  It gives me away every time.  But I was born like this, so it's fine.  I feel fine about it.  I'm having a good no arms year.  It's OK.  It's all OK.  I'm saving on scissors.  It's great.  But a lot of people ask me if I wish that I had hands.  That's the number one question I get is, do you wish I had hands?  The thing is, to be completely honest, I mostly just wish you guys didn't have hands.  That would be great for me.  If we could all just collectively struggle over a jar of peanut butter, that would be great for me.  But things are going pretty well for me.  I'm 30 years old, so, you know, I've been this way my whole life.  I can feed myself.  I can dress myself.  I do pretty much everything on my own.  But some things are a bit of a challenge, you know?  Some things are a bit tough.  Like, for example, I was late for a party recently because I put moisturizer on my arms and then spent the next 25 minutes trying to open the front door.  Okay?  I have a lot of awkward encounters with strangers, as I'm sure you can imagine, you know.  My favorite one is getting change from cashiers.  Getting change from cashiers is always a real treat for both parties, you know.  Because the thing is, when people have money to give me, they don't know where to put it, and I don't know how to receive it.  So it always becomes this awkward exchange that looks sort of like a secret handshake.  that's missing half the equation.  But I realize the thing is it's my fault.  It's sort of on me a little bit.  The reason why I say this is because I'm the one who goes to places like Tim Hortons and I buy a small black coffee and then I give them $20, OK?  That's on me, right?  That's a little bit on me because that's a lot of change coming back to you, right?  So then I was thinking, like, what's the accessible solution to this problem?  Like, how can I make this more accessible for me?  And I found a solution, OK?  I don't go to Tim Hortons anymore.  I go to Starbucks now, OK?  Right?  Because I know if I go to Starbucks and they buy a small black coffee, I give them a $20 bill, I'm not getting any change back. ",
