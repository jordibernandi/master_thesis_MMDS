            "text": "We can't actually go to another planet, but fortunately we don't need to, because we can go to regions of our own planet which are so unfamiliar that they almost might be another planet.  This is Jupiter.  It's a fantasy picture of Jupiter conceived by the astronomer Carl Sagan.  If there were life forms in Jupiter, they would be called Jovians.  So let's use the word by Jovians for creatures on this Earth that are so odd that they might almost be from another planet.  Here, for instance, is a deep-sea fish.  You would have to go on a long journey in a submarine on a diving suit to see that fish.  This is exactly the same species of fish.  The only difference is that this has just had a meal and that hasn't.  That's looking for a meal, as you can tell from its ravening jaws.  These creatures look pretty monstrous to us.  I suppose by their standards, we might be thought monstrous.  This one is another deep-sea fish.  This has a luminous lure made by bacteria, luminous bacteria, and it... uses this as a bait to lure prey into its vicinity.  It then slams its fishing rod down into the vicinity of its jaws, opens them and gulps in the prey.  A very weird, by Jovian creature.  We don't even have to go to the deep sea, as a matter of fact, to see pretty weird creatures.  I was once attending a lecture by a colleague who worked on octopuses.  And he said the fascination with octopuses is these are the Martians.  And he meant that, look at this, this creature could easily be from Mars, couldn't it?  Watch the color change.  That creature, that cuttlefish, it's not an octopus, it's a cuttlefish, is changing color at will.  Look at the waves of color falling over it.  That's not shadows falling over it from outside.  That's internally controlled by the animal, by its own nervous system.  It's registering emotion, signaling to other creatures, others of its own species.  We don't even have to go to the sea at all.  These are all insects.  They all have the same basic insect body plan which they inherited from a common insect ancestor which lived about 350 million years ago.  They all look like insects because they've inherited those attributes.  They all have a head, a thorax, an abdomen, but in this case it's enormously elongated to look like a stick.  Here, the same body is flattened out in this bug.  Again, the head, thorax, abdomen, three pairs of legs, antennae, wings.  Here, butterflies, the same basic body plan, pulled and stretched, kneaded into different shapes.  But basically, the same shape.  They've never quite shaken off their ancestral influence.  And another way to achieve the illusion of waking up on a distant planet is to shrink ourselves, to go on a different kind of journey to a much smaller scale than we're used to.  This is a dust mite.  It's the sort of thing that you've met often in the carpets of your own home, but didn't know it.  It's hugely magnified by an instrument like this, which is a scanning electron microscope.  And we can use the scanning electron microscope just as though it was a telescope pointing at some distant planet.  So strange are the sights that it shows us.  What about zooming out and seeing what this jungle really is?  Okay, let's go slowly now.  There's some curious rounded objects there.  Go further.  Two little patches of rounded objects.  Go further.  Go on.  Right, now I think what we're seeing is the head of a mosquito.  There are the compound eyes.  Lots of different facets of the compound eyes on either side.  In the middle are the sockets of the antennae.  Zoom out further.  And again, there's the whole head.  You can see the whole round head with the sockets for the antennae and the rounded compound eyes with all the different facets.  So we've been on a journey, using the scanning electron microscope, to the world of the very small.  And that's another way of capturing the strangeness of our own world. ",
