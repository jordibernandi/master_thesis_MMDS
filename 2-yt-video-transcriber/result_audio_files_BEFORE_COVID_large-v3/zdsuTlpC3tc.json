Well, it turns out that's a bit of a blind spot for him.  Which is how, in 2003, he wound up dating Captain Picard.  All aboard, and welcome to Matt Baume's Culture Cruise!  In last month's video, we took a look at the evolution of queer characters across the gay 90s, with the show Frasier offering up more LGBTQ episodes than any other sitcom until Ellen and Will & Grace.  This month, I want to take a look at Frasier's final gay episode, 2003's The Doctor is Out, in which, after years of flirting with gay cliches, Frasier finally flirts with a gay person.  By the way, thanks to everyone who makes Culture Cruise possible with a pledge of support on Patreon, folks like Robert Hare, Kevin Schlemmer, and Jack Smith.  If you're enjoying these videos, head over to patreon.com slash matt baume to check out those rewards for backers.  The Doctors Out came at the climax of a particularly turbulent time for LGBTQ folks on TV.  As I talked about in the last video, throughout the 90s, gay characters evolved from being a source of fear, to a fact of life, to being aspirational, to finally being so mainstream.  there was no one way they were depicted.  It was a huge change from one end of the decade to the other, and The Doctor Is Out features all of those different depictions, packed into a half-hour farce with a bit of a twist.  So let's set the scene.  It's 2003, season 11, and Fraser has already had episodes featuring a gay boss, a gay dream, a gay dad, and gay friends.  This episode begins with something new, a gay celebrity.  It's Alistair Burke, director of the Seattle Opera, played by Patrick Stewart.  In real life, Sir Patrick was a big deal at this time, and we'll talk about that in a minute.  For now, Frasier and Niles are simply beside themselves to have run into him.  Okay, I can't fault them for fanning out here.  I'd probably melt if I saw Patrick Stewart in the wild.  But he quickly scampers off, having set up the A-plot.  With that out of the way, the Cranes can move on to the B-plot, meeting Roz's new boyfriend, Barry.  Fraser immediately suspects that Barry is gay.  The giveaway?  He has muscles, he works in fashion, and he helps Roz pick out clothes.  This level of suspicion is a bit rich, coming less than a minute after Frasier and Niles both fell all over each other to worship an opera director.  In fairness, working in fashion had been a gay cliche on TV for decades, like on this 1965 episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show.  Although openly queer characters did pop up on TV from time to time.  in decades past, a lot of media was squeamish about openly acknowledging the existence of gays.  So on those occasions when shows or movies wanted queer characters to exist, but didn't want to actually say that they were queer, they were often coded.  And working in fashion was one of the most frequent ways to do it.  But by 2003, openly queer characters had become far more common on TV.  There was no more need for code.  Those old stereotypes were starting to come off as ridiculously old-fashioned, as Niles points out. ",

And once again, we just have to talk for a minute about what mainstream television thinks gay bars are.  On one hand, this place doesn't look all that different from my own local Seattle gay bar, but it's also called Bad Billy's and advertises a leather knight on a Tuesday who has time after work.  And I think it's a bit of a mismatch that it looks so much like the tasteful waiting room of a dentist's office.  To be fair, this show isn't the first with a curious interpretation of a gay bar.  Back in the 70s, Maude showed one that looked like somebody's living room, Murphy Brown's gay bar looks more like a men's warehouse, and Lauren Bacall discovered the world's most cavernous gay bar in the TV special, Applause.  Something crucial that all these weird TV gay bars seem to miss, which is that queer bars are primarily for queer people.  So often when these bars appear on TV, it's because straight characters have gone to infiltrate them, rather than queer characters just going to relax and unwind.  Gay bars are safe havens, and the fact that Frasier is going into a gay bar to out somebody is... not great.  Anyway, as he arrives for his manhunt, Frasier finds the place to be quite welcoming. ",

Frasier's the butt of the joke not for conforming to gay cliches, but because he's relying so heavily on gay cliches, while also being obtuse about his own.  Meanwhile, outside, Niles discovers that Barry never actually went into the bar.  He just lives nearby.  Niles tries to hide behind a magazine called Naked Guy's Review.  Boy, do I wish that was real.  And then he rushes downstairs to grab Frasier.  He has some difficulty shouting over the music.  I'm begging you, please take me home!  That's pretty direct, as pick-up lines go.  Do you think anyone noticed?  Well, yes, as it turns out.  The next day, on his call-in show... I saw you in a gay bar last night.

Aspirational gay characters were a particularly pleasant development in the 90s.  For decades, LGBTQ characters were only depicted as serial killers, or mentally ill, or tragic, or just a punchline.  How dare you judge  me?\".  But in the late 90s, TV suddenly discovered that queer people can actually be really talented and really funny.  So we started to see open depictions of queer people, who could fix all the messes straight people got themselves into.  In fact, the same year this episode of Frasier aired, Bravo launched a brand new show called Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, which was the most overt depiction, to date, of straight people who wanted to have LGBTQ folks in their lives.  Suddenly, straight TV characters wanted our help.  They wanted what we had.  And few wanted it more than Frasier. ",

Though Frasier was in its final season when this episode aired, we're seeing hints here of what's to come over the next decade.  Shows featuring queer characters whose depictions are far more rich and complex than the simple cliches of decades past, like The L Word, Torchwood, The Office, Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  This episode of Frasier came just at the start of TV offering those much more nuanced depictions.  In that way, The Doctor Is Out serves as a sort of goodbye to the old cliches that TV once clung to.  Cliches so old-fashioned, they could only be a joke.  Land ho!
