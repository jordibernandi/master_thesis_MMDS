            "text": "Nothing gives me more hope for the future than seeing my five grandchildren challenge expectations.  They see breakthroughs in technology we can't even yet imagine, but the only way they're going to get a chance to fill all that potential is if we take drastic action right now to address the climate disaster facing the nation and our world.  More severe storms and droughts?  Rising sea levels, warming temperatures, shrinking snow cover and ice sheets.  It's already happening.  And science tells us that how we act or fail to act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet.  Yet today, President Trump denies the evidence in front of his own eyes, hides climate science produced by his own administration, and actively works to roll back with progress we've already made.  It's reckless, it's irresponsible, and it is unacceptable.  So today, I'm announcing my plan for a clean energy revolution.  It outlines what we have to do to meet this challenge head on and how we're going to get there.  We're going to invest $1.7 trillion in securing our future so that by 2050, the United States will be 100% clean energy economy with net zero emissions.  And by the end of my first term, we will have an enforcement mechanism in place to make sure we stay on track to get there.  No, we're going to make record-breaking investments in research and development in zero-carbon technologies so that America is the engine of the world's clean energy economy.  exporting cutting-edge equipment stamped Made in the USA to help other nations reduce emissions and mitigate and adapt.  This initiative will create more than 10 million new good-paying jobs all across the clean economy in the United States of America.  It's an enormous opportunity.  We'll hold polluters accountable for the damage they've caused, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color.  Not only due to climate change, but the pollution they are pumping into the air that is breathed in the water of the drunk in those communities.  You know, we're not going to forget the workers either.  The workers who, through dangerous and back-breaking labor, powered our industrial rise, mined and built our arsenal of democracy, and fueled America's prosperity through the 20th century.  They've earned our thanks, our respect, and our support.  Finally, we have to bring the world along with us.  Global action requires American leadership.  But the United States only accounts for 15% of global carbon emissions.  The rest of the world has to step up as well.  So on day one, I will immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.  But that's not sufficient.  We need to dramatically accelerate our worldwide effort to meet the intensity of the challenge we face.  So I'll immediately get to work leading a diplomatic initiative to get every nation to go beyond their initial commitment to push our progress further and faster.  This is especially true for China, by far the world's largest emitter of carbon.  We will not only hold their leaders accountable for reducing carbon output at home in their country, but make sure they stop financing billions of dollars in dirty fossil fuel projects all across Asia.  And this will allow us to keep creating good-paying jobs right here at home, even as we raise our own standards.  America once again will be able to stand proudly on the world stage and challenge every other nation to follow our example and our leadership.  For more than three decades, I've led in this issue.  I wrote one of the first climate change bills ever introduced in the United States Senate.  As vice president, I oversaw the single largest investment in clean energy in our nation's history, over $90 billion.  I fought along with President Obama to double the efficiency of our cars, which would reduce our oil consumption by 12 billion barrels.  And for a clean power plant that limited carbon emissions from both existing and new power plants.  As president, I will lead America and the world, not only to confront the crisis in front of us, but to seize the opportunities it presents.  I'll use every authority available to me to drive progress.  And I will not accept half measures because making these revolutionary changes is going to take an incredible commitment at all levels.  But I am absolutely confident that's what the American people want to do.  And we can meet this challenge.  Because this is what America does best.  Solve big problems with big ideas.  That's who we are.  That's who we've been.  We're the United States of America.  And there's not a single thing we cannot do.  And the world badly needs us to do it. ",
