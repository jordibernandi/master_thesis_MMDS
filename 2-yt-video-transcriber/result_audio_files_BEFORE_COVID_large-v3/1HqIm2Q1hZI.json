            "text": "All right, so again, I got two more clips to get to here, but my God.  Cenk is so passionate, and it's because he actually cares.  It is so rare to see this out of a candidate or out of a politician, to see this kind of fight in somebody.  Now, again, the questions that Cuomo was giving Cenk here were just, I mean, they're tough questions.  But if you know, I mean, the facts and the reality behind them, then... They're not really tough questions because a lot of them are just distractions from the actual issues because his opponent in the race doesn't support the kinds of things that Cenk does like Medicare for All.  Let's go through some of them here.  So Cenk brings up how corporate campaign contributions are bribes.  I think this is a brilliant way to discuss it.  It's easily digestible for most people.  They understand this is true.  They are bribes.  I mean, why else do corporations, these massive companies, wealthy donors, why else do they give large sums of money?  It's because it's an investment and they expect a return on that investment.  And if there is no return on that investment, then they stop giving in the future.  So this is obvious to, I think, the vast majority of voters.  This question, I think, is maybe the most fair.  Actually, let me go to this question first, the purple district question.  So this is a point that's, I mean, it is amazing that this sort of narrative is never questioned.  But the moment you question it, it completely falls apart.  This idea that you have to run as a moderate in a purple district.  But ask yourself, what does moderate mean?  It means not fighting for Medicare for all.  So it means you're on the side of insurance companies.  It means not taking on climate change with a bold plan.  So it means you're on the side of fossil fuel companies.  It means not taking on Wall Street.  So it means you're on the side of big banks.  I mean, that's what moderate means.  Moderate simply means you're pro-corporate.  The average voter is not pro-corporate.  So this whole idea that voters in purple districts want a corporate candidate is just completely absurd.  The reality is most voters have only been given two corporate options, a corporate Democrat or a corporate Republican, and the only real differences have been on the social issues.  But now with someone like Cenk Uygur, you have somebody here who is not just progressive on the social issues, but also on the economic issues, actually looks out for the average person.  That is the real difference here.  This question that I was getting to earlier.  So this is a question that I actually think is a fair question.  He doesn't live in the district.  So, I mean, any other race we would question, oh, you don't live in the district.  Why are you running in this race?  In Cenk's case, I mean, he lives in the state.  He lives close to the district.  I believe his district is close to  L.A.,  but it's not L.A So, look, that's a fair question.  But what actually matters, and he brings up the point here, is do you want somebody who lives in the district but won't fight for you or somebody who lives outside the district and will fight for you?  So as Cenk said, he will move to the district if he wins the race.  And obviously, this is somebody who is going to fight for you.  So I think that's ultimately what matters here.  On the old blog posts, I mean, this question, because I know the whole history behind it, is a moot point for me.  I mean, as he said, he deleted them years and years before they were discovered by the right wing.  So the very fact that he deleted those posts like 15 years ago already shows you he didn't agree with them 15 years ago.  So them being brought up now, like this is what people have to understand.  We all grow and change and evolve.  I mean, I wasn't born with all the positions and thoughts that I have right now.  I grew and I learn and I change.  I educate myself.  We all do that.  So this idea that Cenk should have been the exact same person now as he was, what, 20 years ago is crazy.  Very, I mean, people like Bernie Sanders, who were the same person the entire time, who's been the same person for 40 years, that is incredibly rare.  So when you have someone like a Bernie Sanders, I mean, hold on to them.  Like, this is why Bernie Sanders is a leader that really nobody can compete with, because he has had these positions the entire time.  But most people aren't like that.  Most people grow, change, evolve, learn.  So that's the case here with these blog posts.  I 20 years ago and he deleted them 15 years ago.  like it doesn't matter this doesn't matter at all.  um and the young turk's name?  oh so i i haven't showed that clip yet.  so this next clip they're going to talk about the the name of the show his show the young turks uh and ultimately how that i guess could hurt him or what it means.

When I first came across the show The Young Turks, I had no idea what the hell that meant.  And I still, to this day, think it's a horrible name for a media company.  I mean... I really think that them having that name has suppressed their ability to grow more than they would have if they had a different name.  So Young Turks is a stupid name, but not because of its association with the Armenian Genocide, but because it's a dumb name.  Most people don't know the definition of it.  So most people that come across that name may just think, what is this, a show of a bunch of Turkish people?  That's how it comes off.  So it's a stupid name.  But with that said, the show has never... I mean, Anna Kasparian, an Armenian, has been a major part of the show almost the entire time it's existed.  Clearly, if you know the definition of Young Turks, then you know what the show... means and and why they they have that label why they use that name.  um and yeah he's disavowed the genocide.  i mean over and over and over.  it's.  it's crazy how much this still comes up.  i mean i'll see it on twitter occasionally.  people still attack him over it.  it's like dude.  did you see like 10 years ago when he disavowed this?  they just try to create these narratives that have never that haven't been a thing for years and years and years but they try to keep bringing it up to try and smear him or the show.  um Let's get to the last clip here, though, where this is kind of the whole point of all of this, all of these questions.

            "text": "all right that's it.  these questions these tough questions are just distractions from the actual issues the actual issues the policy issues that he would fight for compared to everybody else in the race.  now i just want to make a quick comment about the way the way cuomo was taking um jenks enthusiasm.  It almost seemed like Cuomo thought that Cenk was yelling at him, but that's just who Cenk is.  Cenk is passionate.  That's how he comes off.  But it was just funny to see Chris Cuomo be like, hey, I'm just asking the questions here.  But OK, so let's get to the issues here.  The obvious way to compare Cenk Uygur to his main rivalry or rivalry, his main opponent in this race, his main Democratic opponent in this race, Christy Smith, is to look at their websites.  So when you go to Cenk's website, he has an issues page, and it centers issues like corruption in politics, higher wages, climate change.  But when you go to Christy Smith's page, there is no issues page.  I mean, I spent time on this site looking for what she believed, and I read her Meet Christy page.  It discusses what she's done as somebody, as a state representative.  But it doesn't talk about what she actually supports and what she would fight for if she were to win the seat in Congress.  So when you have someone like this who doesn't tell you what they're about, her average contribution is $2,700, which is crazy.  I mean, the contribution limit is $2,800.  So the fact that her average is $2,700... I mean, it really shows you who she represents.  Whereas Cenk Uygur, he gets his donations from real people, from the average person, because he's going to fight for the average person.  It doesn't take corporate money.  It doesn't have private fundraisers.  So Christy Smith has the backing of the Democratic Party establishment because she's a safe bet.  She's going to play ball.  She'll play their game.  Cenk is not going to get that support.  So, I mean, even if he wins his seat, they're not going to support him.  It's going to be similar in the way that Nancy Pelosi has treated AOC and other justice Dems.  Because they are, I mean, what AOC fights for and other just Democrats fight for.  It is antithetical to what Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic establishment want because the establishment raised lots of money from corporations, listened to private interests.  Those private interests are heavily considered when creating policy.  But AOC and other Justice Democrats and Cenk Uygur, because they're only funded by the people, they don't have to answer to any private interest.  They just answer to the people, which is why they're able to publicly fight for things like Medicare for all, like canceling student debt, like the Green New Deal.  So they are not attached to anybody but the actual voters.  That is the main difference in what you would get with someone like or with Cenk Uygur compared to anybody else in this race.  I mean, look, I think it's clear.  I think the choice is obvious.  If you were in this district, not only should you be donating to Cenk if you can, but you should also be volunteering.  Because this is a race that if you have, oh my God, if you have Cenk Uygur in Congress... It will be, I'm not even sure how to describe it.  There will be a seismic shift in what is going to happen in Washington, D.C.  Because he is going to be a fighter.  I mean, not just a fighter for his district, which of course he will, but a fighter in general for people all across the country.  So you're going to have somebody who is brash, who's going to be out there, who's going to be fighting for these policies alongside politicians like AOC and Rashida Tlaib and others.  If you want to support a campaign that actually looks to change government to help people, change it for the better, change it so it's not simply answering to corporate interest, to Wall Street, to special interest, to donors, but listening to the people, then I think it's obvious that you should be supporting Cenk Uygur for Congress.
