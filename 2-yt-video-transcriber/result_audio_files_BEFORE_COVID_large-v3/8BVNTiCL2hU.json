            "text": "What's up, everybody?  It's your girl back for another video.  So, y'all, I haven't made a video in forever.  I just wanted to update everybody.  I had my baby.  She is a beautiful, lovely, 7-pound, 12-ounce bundle of joy.  I'm gonna show her in my next video.  This is my first time getting out.  I'm about to pick my husband and I up a coffee.  It is Christmas.  We're at the house with the kids.  They're, you know, playing with their presents, enjoying Christmas morning.  So I decided to make a video real quick.  Just wanted to update you all.  And, you know, I have a few minutes of peace and quiet.  And I want to tell everybody Merry Christmas.  I'm so tired of hearing happy holidays from everybody.  We're living in a time where everybody gets offended about everything.  Everybody wants to be a victim.  Everybody gets their little feelings hurt.  You got to walk on eggshells.  I am not going to say happy holidays.  Every time somebody says that to me, I say Merry Christmas.  This is America.  Merry Christmas is part of American culture.  If you don't like it, don't come here.  Simple as that.  You can't get offended at American culture.  This is America.  You know, if I went to another country, you know, moved to China or moved just anywhere else, they're not going to change their culture, their religious beliefs and, you know, different.  uh, holidays to appease me.  They're not going to change anything, you know, and it would be stupid for me to get offended if I chose to move there.  You know, Merry Christmas should not offend anyone.  If you're not Christian or religious, you should not get offended at that.  Nobody's saying it to you to offend you.  Um, but so yeah, I just want to tell everybody Merry Christmas.  I will not say Happy Holidays.  I will not Show my beautiful little angel on my next video.  I have not gotten any sleep since I had her.  It's been a week.  It's been really, really rough.  I forgot how hard it is to have a newborn, even though this is my third baby.  but she is such a joy.  I am so, so grateful that everything turned out okay.  Um, because you know, of the miscarriage that I had right before I had her, it was really bad and it was around Christmas time.  Um, it just, you know, makes me so grateful that she's here and she's healthy.  Um, but I'm sorry, I haven't made videos y'all.  It's just, I've been going through a lot.  There's a lot of things going on and, uh, But anyway, I hope y'all all having a Merry Christmas.  I hope everybody's doing well.  I love you all and I will see y'all back on my next video.  Bye. ",
