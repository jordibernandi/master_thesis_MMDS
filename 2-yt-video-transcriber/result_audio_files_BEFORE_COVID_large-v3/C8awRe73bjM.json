            "text": "Before the video begins, I just wanted to give a shout out to the men who have supported the crowdfunding campaign for my MGTOW video game.  The support is beyond anything I or the team expected, and we're only on the fourth day of funding.  We're working on getting the demo out as soon as we can.  Obviously, we don't want to rush it, and it is a pre-alpha demo, but we have received your message loud and clear.  You're ready for a MGTOW video game.  Thanks for the support, and we'll have more updates soon.  The power of MGTOW is self-evident in any man focused on utilizing the strengths of it to his advantage, but getting to that point requires the shedding of the ego and a reconstruction of one's worldview, using the undeniable truths that have been presented to you and that you have observed in your own path.  Along the way to masculine empowerment, you will lose many things that you likely held dear and that helped shape your personality, your outlook, and your ambitions.  Some days you may wish that you never found MGTOWM at all, so that you could go back to your former self and reclaim what was lost, but hopefully you snap out of that train of thought just as quickly as you entered into it, because to turn away when the going gets tough is an injustice to your future self.  the first thing you lose is the innocence that blinded you from seeing what was in front of you the whole time.  delving into the worst aspects of female nature is one thing but to examine eternal behavioral patterns that have always existed and will always exist is something that strips your naive nature and leaves you stranded in the middle of nowhere naked and alone.  there are major red flags that many modern women have developed due to the structure of our modern societies but there are just as many things that are inherently a part of them that may be able to be restrained partially but never outright removed.  understanding that yes the modern woman is a wreck and an embarrassment but women from past generations would present many of the same difficulties can put things into perspective and reveal that the struggle to preserve male sovereignty extends far beyond any social engineering decadence or corruption that we might face today.  You can never go back to sleep.  It is the great double-edged sword that you will wield to confront the world from now on.  On one hand, it is a great thing to be aware, to be conscious of your surroundings, and to continue to work to expand that understanding.  But on the other hand, because you can never go back to sleep, you can never truly rest.  sticking your head in the sand will no longer work because your head won't fit.  turning the other way and ignoring what you know to be true will only drive you mad with guilt and the insecurity that comes from knowing you aren't pushing yourself in the right direction.  the most damaging thing that i lost after finding mctow was my drive.  i had ambitions to make six figures and eventually raise a large family but after the introspection that came after finding mgtown i realized i couldn't sacrifice my youth and body slaving away for something that would be used to destroy me later.  It wasn't even so much about children, but more of building something that can be passed on after I'm gone.  Losing this ambition fundamentally changed the structure of everything.  After a while, however, I realized I hadn't lost the drive, I just had to rediscover it.  It was never gone, it had changed its form and became unrecognizable to me because I was still looking at the world with my old pair of eyes, with an outdated outlook that did not incorporate what I wanted and what would best serve my interests.  I mentally retired from that life and chose to be a teacher and live a simple life, building myself and passing on things that are more important to me than simple genes.  The drive is never truly lost, it just has to be reharnessed and redirected to serve another purpose, yours.  The next thing that falls away as you reshape yourself after finding MGTOW is the relations you have to most people.  You can learn something from every person, even if it's what not to do.  Just because someone's worldview doesn't align exactly with yours after finding MGTOWM doesn't mean they can't offer something else.  But understand that despite the majority of people being selfish and small-minded, they don't really serve themselves.  They are bound by the opinions of others, by the boundaries that are placed onto them by their culture, and never challenge that comfortable prison they live within.  The highest form of consciousness is being in direct communication and understanding with your inner self.  Deconstructing your thoughts and your desires through meditation, introspection and expression to understand yourself is something that is foreign to them, an unnecessary distraction that serves only to dismantle the world that was built for them to live within.  The most striking transformation comes from the death of romanticism with women.  Whether you choose to enjoy the MGTOW monk or bachelor lifestyle, the idealism you once had with women will be gone.  There are no more butterflies, no more daydreams and no more questions of motives because you know how they operate.  You begin to understand they really are a different species, that they approach every single situation from a different perspective based on their biology and unchangeable characteristics.  Now that they have been removed from the goal of the path, they can never amount to anything more than passing distractions.  Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?  That's what it is to be a slave.  Jesus.  Jesus. ",
