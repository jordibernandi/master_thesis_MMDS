            "text": "Let's talk for real for real about Vangirl possibly being a YouTube plant.  See, y'all done messed up now, because you've enabled me.  The cuckoo about to jump out!  Listen, I like to spend an unreasonable amount of time alone, you know, just puttering around my apartment in sweatpants with no shirt on like I'm somebody's dad.  Point is, I'm in my own head a lot of the time.  And we barely scratched the surface in my last video.  I had no idea that so many of you guys were tinfoil hat gang gang gang with me.  But a lot of you guys seem to suspect right along with me that YouTube is up to something.  There's definitely something afoot.  And it's not limited only to these potentially planted channels and personalities.  As I discussed in my last video, YouTube has failed repeatedly to establish themselves as a Netflix or Hulu caliber platform.  And I think it's only getting harder and harder for them with each failure because we as viewers are getting more and more savvy.  We're much savvier than we were 10 years ago.  For example, I would love to see the percentage of YouTube users who are power users today compared to what I know was a relatively low percentage six or so years ago.  More importantly is the expectation of the user because when you or I, when we go to YouTube for content, almost certainly our expectation of what that content should be and will be is going to be different from what it is when we go to Netflix for content.  I was chatting with you guys in the comments about this and I know for me my expectation of what I want from YouTube is completely different from what I want from.  And at this point, many, many of us are power users.  in so far as a lot of us, you know, we see through the matrix.  We don't go to the trending page to decide what we're going to watch.  We're quite judicious about what we consume and what we do not consume.  And all of those decisions are, of course, being tracked and stored.  Google, which of course owns YouTube, owns an unbelievable amount of all of our personal data at this point.  Pretty much all of it.  YouTube and Google have comprehensive psych profiles on pretty much all of us.  I know.  it's terrifying but as the old saying goes if the product is free you are the product.  this is why gmail is free this is why youtube is free this is why instagram is free and this is why facebook is free.  this is why there's a bar of entry to use even the most basic features on these platforms like liking a video or post or commenting and other things like such as by forcing people to create accounts to have access to even these basic features to engage with the content that we consume.  they're able to track our behaviors in many cases for upwards of a decade now.  And if your Gmail is also the same address you use to log into your YouTube account, forget about it.  This means that they have data on data on data on how long you watch this video and how long you watch that video, how many times they have to show you a suggestion before you actually engage with the content, what you subscribe to, what you unsubscribe from, the list goes on and on.  Fact is, Skynet, I mean Google, knows more about us than any of us really would like to think about.  And it's only learning more each day, even right now as you're watching this video, or maybe if you've already bailed on it and you haven't even heard me say this part, it's tracking all of this.  The call is coming from inside the house.  All of this information creates a fairly serious existential crisis of wondering just how much of our feeds are free will based on our choices versus conditioning based on predictive behaviors, doesn't it?  We have opted in to being stalked.  For the record, it has not escaped me that I'm using the very technology that I'm bemoaning to post this video.  I do appreciate the irony.  If nothing else, I'm a walking contradiction, a Luddite with a YouTube channel.  The greatest irony, though, is YouTube profiting from me criticizing it.  As long as this video doesn't get demonetized, which it probably will, they're making a nice cut of the AdSense.  Anyway, with a decade plus of data on all of us, I would hope that YouTube has learned something from their past blunders.  And this is why I think they've gotten more sophisticated with moving forward in their attempt to reshape the brand.  Case in point, Janelle Eliana, a.k.a.  Vangirl.  I reiterate, I 100% do not know for a fact that she's a plant.  It's just kind of fun to speculate because it's not that far-fetched.  And moreover, I truly hope that she's not a plant.  I want her to be real.  But I got my tinfoil hat on under this turban, and she's a tingling.  A lot of you guys were saying that you like Janelle Eliana.  Of course you do.  She's very likable.  But... That is the entire point.  If she is a plant, and none of us can prove that she is, it is by design that she's extremely likable.  One suspicious thing, and I touched on this last time, is her use of the term university for someone who claims to be from NorCal.  Here in the US, including in NorCal, people say go to college, not go to university.  Could this mean that they took liberties with NorCal and actually meant North of California as in Canada?  I pay very close attention to language.  Honestly, probably too much for someone who has to deal with the unyielding incoherence on the internet.  But to me, that was a tell.  Her use of uni or university dinged me.  the same way it does when I meet someone who says, I'm from New York.  As someone from Queens, I know I need to translate that immediately.  Because if someone just says, I'm from New York, that means that that person is from upstate New York.  You know, Syracuse or Buffalo or one of them.  Because no one from the boroughs says, I'm from New York.  You say, I'm from Queens, I'm from Brooklyn, I'm from the Lower East side.  Fellow New Yorkers from the boroughs, y'all better back me up on this.  98% of the time, this is true 100% of the time.  We do not say, I'm from New York.  We rep our boroughs.  I digress.  Let's talk more about how this would indeed be the perfect YouTube plant because the quirk factor is on a thousand.  She has a pet snake named Alfredo and she lives in a van.  Even the name Janelle Eliana sounds like it came straight out of a pitch meeting.  Because when I think of someone living in a van, I think of Matt Foley.  Making this the perfect reversal of expectations.  We've seen enough of the cute Gen Z white girls on YouTube who pretend that they aren't extremely wealthy.  It's time to branch out.  She's 20 years old, a great age to appeal to Gen Z rather than salty millennials who refuse to play ball with YouTube's repeated reboots.  She also mentioned being first generation and having an African dad in her interview with Philip DeFranco and conveniently has no trace of herself online whatsoever predating her come up because she claims not to have gotten a laptop until her senior year of high school, I believe.  Call me a hater if you want, but... I don't believe you.  It's all just a little too convenient.  She's also somewhat racially ambiguous because we know she has an African dad, but Africa is a continent.  Although I will concede that her race and her ethnicity do not matter.  In this country, far too much emphasis is placed on how we can classify and label people.  I only mention her being somewhat racially ambiguous because, cynical as it is to say, she's the right kind of Black girl if YouTube were to be casting the next Black star, not to be confused with Black star.  It doesn't have to matter to me personally what a person's race or ethnicity is to still be able to see quite clearly that a racially ambiguous, exotic aesthetic is prized very, very highly in social media and it sells.  Let's be real, she's thin, medium-light brown skin, and she's got a hair texture that companies have been trying to sell women with my hair texture through their custards and creams and puddings for the better part of a decade.  Best of all, her channel's success offers YouTube plausible deniability in the face of anyone who challenges them in terms of being really sincerely inclusive in terms of whom they embrace publicly.  After all, YouTube seems to have all but done away with programs like NextUp for content creators.  Seems now that they're just deciding for themselves directly who's next up, who's the next big thing, and they're seeing to it.  I mean, some of y'all were telling me in the comments that you had been subscribed to her channel without even knowing it.  i say again do not put it past them to juke the stats.  i will say though juking the stats is not a great strategy long term.  on the channel that i worked on in the original programming initiative once they stopped gifting us subscribers everything went to.  juking the stats only caused a ton of confusion once it became time to grow organically.  luckily we did manage to turn things around and even though I'm not there anymore.  The channel is still very much around.  What was the change, you ask?  How did we turn things around once juking the stats was no longer on the table?  We made the channel feel like a real place and not a corporate brand.  We made it personality-based and focused on us, the people who were actually working there, running the channel.  And it worked.  I say ish because return on investment is nearly impossible with most corporate channels.  You have an entire staff to pay.  So if you have a channel with say 2 million subscribers, that could be a ton of AdSense revenue for a one man band style channel.  but if you have an entire staff of employees to pay, you are in the red.  For some channels, juking the stats then becomes necessary indefinitely, just to be able to dupe sponsors into paying falsely inflated rates on content deals.  This is why people buy views and followers.  Or else these corporate channels wind up cutting ties, reducing staff to the bare minimum, just in the hopes of getting out of the red.  Spill, which we also talked about last time, obviously has a whole ass staff behind it.  It explains not just the quality, but also the delay in their content making it to air relative to whatever they're talking about in any given video.  Because most of the traditional drama channels are just racing to be the first to publish.  That is the name of the game in that subreddit of YouTube.  Unlike Spill, quality basically is not a concern.  This is how we wind up with a 15 minute long voiceover video where we're just staring at the same screenshot the entire time.  Somehow these channels managed to find ways to turn someone liking someone else's tweet into a 10 minute plus long video just so that the video is long enough for them to sprinkle in 5011 mid-roll ads.  But Dramageddon a few months back showed YouTube that there's a pretty penny to be made in drama videos, so why not get in on it?  And at the same time, why not elevate them?  All of this, Emma Chamberlain, Spill, Janelle Eliana, it's all obviously about money.  Even with all the unsavory, not advertiser-friendly channels like mine, YouTube is already making money hand over fist.  but there's more money to be made if YouTube looks a certain way.  After all, WorldStar is not getting the same CPM as, I don't know, Goop?  Is Goop still a thing?  And of course, the YouTube overlords want to maximize their wealth by appealing to the highest paying advertisers.  And you might be wondering, why does any of this matter?  If we like Janelle Eliana, what's the harm in her being the next Jenna Marbles or whatever?  There isn't harm per se, But influence is currency.  When we allow people and entities to have influence, we give them power.  And if a YouTube channel is indeed a plant, do we really want to surrender all of our power simply by falling in line?  I don't know the answer to that.  This is a conversation.  And at the end of the day, we should just watch what we like.  We should watch what we want to watch.  i'm just hoping that in doing so we all try to keep our eyes open.  whether it's your fave trying to sell you some you don't need in an undisclosed ad.  hint.  if it feels like it's sponsored it almost definitely is or if it's youtube selling us a whole ass channel.  in either of these cases and any others that arise let's just try to be thoughtful and not completely passive about what we watch and why we're supporting it.  That is going to do it for this Tea Talk.  See, I told y'all, y'all should have never enabled me because the tinfoil hat gang, apparently we run deep.  Thank you so much for hanging out with me and indulging me in my wild conspiracy theorizing.  And last but not least, always remember, never trust anyone with a Morphe code.  Bye-bye.  That's a nappy-headed hose there, I'm going to take that down. ",
