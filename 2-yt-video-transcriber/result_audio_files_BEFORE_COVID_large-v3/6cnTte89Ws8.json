            "text": "Hello.  Don't you dare touch that mouse.  You are right where you are supposed to be.  And that is on the Power Dynamics YouTube channel.  I'm Dr.  Claude Anderson, probably your only Black forensic historian in this nation.  Today, I got a couple of things I want to talk to you about.  First of all, to let you know that I'm here to do what's never been done, and that is to connect the dots between where Black folk are, what got them where they are, and what's been keeping them where they are.  And we're going to start by giving you the right data and the right understandings.  Now, my first commitment is something I learned years ago as a young man.  Back as a young man, I said to myself once, looking at some historical documents, that I'm going to do something to try to take care of the most beaten, enslaved, Jim Crow, maldistributed people in the world, and that is the Black people in this nation.  They've been beat up on by every generation of every ethnic group, every religious group, every cultural group, every language group.  Everybody has exploited, misused, and enriched themselves off of black folk.  So I said to myself, I got to do something.  And the first thing that I said I was going to do, when I looked around, I saw a picture of a praying black slave.  And what he was saying is that he said, I pray that one day, there shall arise among our people a warrior who would know our suffering and would be able to fight our battles.  Well, I'm here.  I might not be that warrior, but I am going to try to fight Black folks' battles.  I made a commitment to myself back in those days to say, anytime I get a chance, I'm going to try to bring some justice to those beaten, underclass, subordinated, and lynched, castrated, misused, and abused people called Black Americans.  Now, in doing that, I said, how should I go about doing it?  First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to try to get as much education as I could.  And so I was blessed.  I earned about six college degrees, everything from social, economics, to politics, to education, and to business.  And I'm very proud of those accomplishments.  Then I said, now how do I best use those things?  Oh, how do I get any blessings or return for having acquired all these different degrees?  It happened just like I anticipated and was delighted to have happen.  And that is, I got appointed, first of all, to some of the best positions a man could ever have.  In education, for instance, I got a chance to teach every grade level from the elementary school levels to high schools, to junior colleges, and to two or three universities.  And lastly, I got a chance to be appointed to be over education for the state of Florida for about seven years from 1970 to 1977.  That was a very unique appointment.  Governor Rubinasky appointed me to be over everything in education in the state of Florida.  That's from the elementary school all the way to the graduate schools in both the private sector and in the public sector.  That was very special.  And I enjoyed doing that.  And I tried to bring some justice and some better educational opportunities for Black folk and Black children in the state of Florida.  Next thing I knew, I said, now, what else am I going to get for having acquired all these different degrees?  And ironically, I was appointed to be the first Black in the history of the nation to ever be to manage a presidential election for Jimmy Carter.  I was Jimmy Carter's campaign manager in the South and in Florida.  I didn't say I was participating in a political campaign by passing out literature and knocking on doors.  I was the actual manager, a black man managing the presidential election.  Following that, I also had a chance to be the deputy. ",
