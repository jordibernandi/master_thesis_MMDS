            "text": "Black Ram 313 back at it again.  You know why?  It's because this is therapeutic, man.  Back again with another video.  Hence, another therapy session.  Today's topic and title is Why Nice Guys Always Finish Last.  Now, this is a subject that has been done repeatedly by many different YouTubers over the last decade or so even.  However, I never touched on this subject.  So now it is time to give my two cents on this subject as well.  So here we go.  One way to tell if a woman is really not into you.  One way to tell if a woman is really not attracted to you is when you hear these words.  Aww, he's such a nice guy.  Such a statement always means that she doesn't want you except for friendship.  Though saying is true, the nice guy always finish last if he finishes at all.  In the competitive race of dating, The nice guy is the slowest, being naive to female nature and naive to his own biology.  So the nice guy finishes last.  He gets the girl, yes, but only after she is tired of riding the carousel for at least minimally a decade.  He gets what little, if anything, remains of the box and of her heart.  He's the cleanup guy, the guy she doesn't respect, the guy that's being laughed at, the guy who's wifing up the single mom.  Am I talking about you?  But why is the question, does the nice guy finish last?  So here are five reasons.  As to the explanation of why the nice guy always finish last and will continue to do so, here we go.  She likes strength in a man.  And there are two types of perceived strength from my viewpoint.  A uncontrolled, immature and mostly physical strength.  Strength that is impulsive, chaotic and destructive as seen in Thuggo and Nim.  Type B controlled strength that is mostly mental, is quiet, confident and reserved.  Mature as seen in a working man.  the blue collar or the professional man.  He's in touch with his masculinity.  He's in shape and can protect himself, but he's not loud and tumultuous about it.  Now she, the succubus in particular, she is attracted to immature strength in her most valuable and fertile years.  And at this time, Thuggo is a real man.  With his exaggerated masculinity, swearing that he's tough.  And just because you can't pull your pants up, don't make you tough.  Newsflash, right?  But as the creature, the succubus, as she ages and goes toward the end of her vitality and is headed closer and closer to menopause, her desire changes.  And desires the male with mature strength.  Not because she is now mature or values him as an individual.  No, no, no.  But because she desires such a man to financially support the offspring she had with the impulsive and immature male who was unable to take care of his own kids and even take care of himself, a.k.a.  Thuggo.  So she then picks the nice guy because now she wants stability for her ready made family or produce a family with her used and worn out and damaged vag.  One thing I notice about female nature, if you just wait a while, she will tell on herself many times on dating sites along with picture.  The female will post a meme and the meme often depicts where her mind is at this point in her life.  She does not do anything objectively.  Everything for her is subjective.  So I came across a plenty of fish mean had to screenshot it.  And I think it's applicable here.  And the meme says, and I quote, this is from a succubus.  And I quote, At this age, I'm only interested in consistency, stability, respect, and loyalty.  Now that says volumes.  What were you interested in when you were younger?  Probably the opposite of consistency, stability, respect, and loyalty.  But now since she is older, She wants to cash in her chips and receive more for what is used and broken than she wanted when it was fresh and new.  Such it is with the succubus.  And she put this on the dating site because she's looking for the nice guy.  And this is what is meant when I say The nice guy finishes last.  He gets the leftover after she's been riding the carousel when she's used up.  Now she desires consistency and stability.  Where is she going to get that from?  Again, the nice guy.  So that's the nice guy is last the last of the group of guys that she dated and had relations with.  last to get the badge.  Like being the last to bathe in a standing tub of water after 50 guys have been in it.  No drainage.  The same dirty bath water to soak in.  The nice guy is the last to soak in the dirt filled bathtub.  Are you a nice guy?  You say no.  Hmm.  What is your wife's body count?  Does she have children with other men?  If a body count is high and she has a baby already before she met you, you are indeed a nice guy.  Number two, as to the reason why nice guys finish last is because the creature, the succubus is an animal.  It goes off of its base and primal instincts.  Has nor can have higher thinking.  It cannot evolve.  It does not evolve.  It will not.  What I'm saying is this.  For thousands of years, it was advantageous for her to desire and select the biggest and the strongest man she could find, especially during the age of hunters and gatherers.  The big and strong would get the best results not only in hunting for food, but in protection of the family and the tribe.  Now fast forward to the 21st century and size and muscles mean nothing.  This is the information age.  Nerds rule.  Scrunny bodies with big brains, so to speak.  Nerds rule the world.  One named Bill Gates.  One place, Silicon Valley.  Nerds who are the captains of industry can hire thousands of strong men as bodyguards and security versus a man being his own individual strong man and going at it alone.  These nice guys slash.  nerds have real power, but the succubus, its brain, hasn't evolved with the times.  The creature is in a perpetual state of adolescence mentally.  It doesn't actually possess the intelligence to appreciate the nice guy, at least at its most fertile and viable age.  In this day and age, she still believes that Pookie, who served four years for knocking over a liquor store, is strong and alpha.  This is the definition of stupidity in which she is the very embodiment of such.  Understand that being smart, educated, reliable and hardworking does nothing for her when it comes to attraction.  particularly when she's young.  Those aforementioned traits are only desirable when she's looking for a man to take care of Pookie, Ray Ray, Thuggo and Nim's babies.  Again, the nice guy who is a cleanup guy.  The creature is an animal.  Its instincts are just to mate with the most attractive guy at the time.  again the succubus is an animal nothing more.  see this creature for what it is.  number three as to the reason why nice guys finish last.  why she doesn't like the nice guy is because she knows on a deep subconscious level that she doesn't deserve.  a nice guy therefore can appreciate.  a nice guy behind the layers And gallons of makeup, the perfume, the clothing, the jewelry, the weave is a malicious, vindictive evil, calculating, arrogant and manipulative and pretentious heart.  The nice guy will not call her out on her behavior and her character.  He's afraid of her.  Yes, the nice guy is afraid of her, afraid of her disapproval.  Or worse, he fears that she just may walk out of the door and leave him behind.  Therefore, she can do whatever she wants.  The nice guy accepts this.  She has a tendency to be evil.  The succubus knows this about each other.  This is why they don't get along.  They know that there are no truly redeeming qualities in themselves, which is why females can't stand each other.  Like cats, always bickering, hence the term cat fight.  The creature is also very nasty.  I was a janitor once and I can tell you that their bathrooms are on another level of funk and disgust.  They are far from being clean, moral and good like they're often portrayed and perceived.  In her mind, the nice guy should see these things in her, thus treating her accordingly.  But since he can't see it and treat her like she really deserves, then in her mind, she sees Mr.  Nice guy as weak.  And that which is weak cannot be respected.  And that which is not respected is resented in the mind of the female.  Now the a-hole of a guy treats her like she deserves that she can feel the opposite toward the a-hole than she feels to the nice guy.  The nice guy is afraid to treat her like the thought that she is.  This is one of the reasons why she cannot truly like the nice guy.  She only uses the nice guy to clean up the mess that Pookie and them, Thuggo and them have left behind.  Clean up on aisle seven, which is her life.  Number four, as to the reason why nice guys finish last is because nice guys are simps.  Now, there is a place in her life for simps, such as being the male friend or the guy who wipes her up at 35 plus after she rode the carousel for 20 plus years or more.  She behaved as a thought, has the baggage of a thought, and should be treated as a thought.  But the nice guy cannot do that.  The nice guy instead is to be used and cheated on.  With Thuggo and discarded and taken to court in a divorce where he departs with his hard earned money.  Do you feel sorry for the nice guy?  Number five and last as to the reason why nice guys finish last, why she just is not truly attracted to the nice guy.  Is because the nice guy is predictable.  He's consistent and accommodating.  He's safe.  He's a planner as opposed to being unpredictable, aloof, volatile and impulsive.  In other words, the nice guy is boring.  She likes the emotional highs and lows.  But the nice guy just cannot do that for her.  Her nature is to be attracted to evil.  In fact, the most evil and vile of men.  The worse the guy is, the more she's attracted to him because naturally she wants to indulge in the chaos that such a man provides.  So the bad guy is good in her mind and a nice guy is bad in her mind, depending on the time in her life.  When she's young, she's having fun with the bad guy.  But she wants to get taken care of and provided for by the good guy when she's older.  It's her world.  And believe me, gentlemen, nine times out of 10, she's going to ride the carousel when she's young, thuggo and them, and then find a nice simp when she's 35 and 40.  And then you're going to debate and argue whether you should wife up the single mother, whether you should wife her up after she's ridden the carousel, if you question that.  You are the nice guy.  If you are in that situation, you are the nice guy.  So when all the nice guy is last.  Because he comes in last, he comes in after the thugs have blown out her grip.  In the badge, he comes after the three kids and two baby daddies.  He comes after she has had some diseases.  He comes after she has been in love a few times and has no emotional space left in her heart for anyone else.  And which is why she says she will always love her baby daddy.  Number one.  And number two, but mainly number one.  The nice guy comes after Keisha is 35 plus and hit the wall.  He comes after her weight has ballooned from 147 in her 20s to 197 in her 30s.  The nice guy comes when she's used up and useless.  He comes after she has ridden the carousel again for 15 or more years.  He comes when she can no longer love or serve a husband.  The nice guy has no self-respect, no self-esteem, and no value in himself.  Therefore, he gets no respect, not even from the nasty thought that he's trying to rescue.  He's the guy that always, will always, must always finish last and by last again.  I mean he wipes her after everyone else has had their turn.  When no one wants her anymore except him.  Again, are you the nice guy?  And it's no mystery.  Just look at the woman you're dealing with.  Look at the woman you're dating.  Look at the woman you're wiping up, have or is trying to wipe up.  Examine her and then you can examine if you are the nice guy.  Again, she has kids from a previous relationship.  You are the nice guy.  If you can count the bodies that she's had and you need all of your fingers and toes to do so, you are the nice guy.  If she weighs more than she did in her 20s, you are the nice guy.  If she has an attitude and believes she deserves to be waited on hand and foot and served, you are the nice guy.  If she's been in love before and in love many times, you are the nice guy.  So let it be no mystery and no doubt who the nice guy is.  The nice guy is you when you wife her up and she's undeserving.  That's the video.
