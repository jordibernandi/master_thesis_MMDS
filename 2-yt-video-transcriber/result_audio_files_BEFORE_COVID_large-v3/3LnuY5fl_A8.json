            "text": "Are fascists Nazis?  Are Nazis fascists?  Am I going to have to bleep every second word in this video?  The answer to all of those questions is a resounding yes.  Hi, my name is Aaron, this is my show ReEducation, and today we're going to be talking about the difference between Nazis and fascists, or at least one of the differences.  So, let's get into it.  Okay, so one of the main things that you have to realize when you're talking about fascism is it's kind of an umbrella term.  There are many different ways that you can institute fascism, and it's basically different in every country that's ever instituted it.  Very similar to the way capitalism is.  In every country that there is capitalism, it's instituted in a slightly different way.  Saudi Arabia is a capitalist country, along with... Denmark.  They're both capitalist countries, though they're instituted in radically different ways.  The same thing goes for fascism.  There's many different ways that you can institute it.  So the term fascism is kind of slippery and hard to identify.  But what we can say is that one key element of fascism is their relationship to nationalism.  Fascism, technically, is an ultra-nationalist authoritarian ideology.  And ultra-nationalism is very similar to traditional nationalism.  In nationalism, you typically venerate your country and think that it is or should be better than every other country.  But in ultra-nationalism, not only do you venerate your country and think that it should be better, you actively believe and enforce that it is better.  And every other country, in your opinion, is far inferior to you.  It's really interesting because this key aspect of fascism doesn't really have anything to do with race.  It has to do with geography, and actually a lot of things to do with fascism actually have to do with geography, and history, and that sort of thing.  In certain aspects of it, it can deal with race, but we'll get to that in a minute.  So, ultranationalism is essentially advanced nationalism, where not only do you promote the interests of your own nation, but you actively have disdain and xenophobia for any other nation that isn't your own, and you believe that you are superior to all of those nations.  In Fascist Italy, they had this very belief, where all peoples who were ever once in the control of the Roman Empire were superior beings, and they should all be liberated from their current captors and brought into the fascistic regime.  That was the whole idea of Italian fascism, was kind of a renaissance, a revival, a renewal of ancient Rome, if you will.  And it was all based around this twisted, morbid science known as social Darwinism.  A kind of inverted, shadow version of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, only instead of it having to do with the superiority of certain genes winning out in a long period of time.  in a biological sense, they thought survival of the fittest meant conflict in between interracial groups.  Interspecies conflict.  all of a sudden became this survival of the fittest, this idea of social Darwinism.  You have to be the strongest to survive in your social setting.  That giving way to all kinds of justifications for all sorts of unjustified hierarchies.  All of a sudden, when people were able to manipulate the system to gain more money or more power or more resources than everybody else, they were seen as being genetically superior.  Because they must be.  If they were able to use their brain power or their muscle or whatever it was to manipulate the system to get what they wanted, then clearly... they were superior to everybody else.  A whole new class of elites were born just out of this single idea.  And all of a sudden, the idea of might makes right becomes kind of the norm.  It becomes the modus operandi of fascism.  I've talked a lot about fascists here, but what about the Nazis?  Well, Nazis were kind of revolutionary in this aspect because not only were they ultra-nationalist, They were ethno-nationalist.  Not only did they believe that they needed to have a nation that was superior to all other nations, that nation was specifically made of white people.  Nazis believe in nationalism, but only white nationalism.  Not only do they believe that they're superior geographically, but they believe that they're superior racially.  Genetically, they think that their genes, their essence, their blood is inherently superior to all other beings.  And they can prove that because they have blonde hair, blue eyes, and fit that Aryan stereotype.  Anybody who fits that stereotype to a Nazi is apparently a superior being, an ubermensch.  Again, another bastardized idea, this one stolen from Friedrich Nietzsche.  The idea that there is a superior being one person or one group of people that is better than all others.  So genetically, if there's one race that happens to be superior to all other races, then inevitably they would want to have their own nation so they could finally see the full potential of their race achieved.  Thus, giving way to them wanting to have an ethno-state.  A state in which every person in that society is of the same ethnicity.  So, that's basically one of the main differences between fascists and Nazis.  Fascists venerate the state, while Nazis venerate race.  At least, that's the way I look at it.  My name is Aaron.
