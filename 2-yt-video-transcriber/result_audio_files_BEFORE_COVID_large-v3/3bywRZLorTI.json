And we're just going to let Kim Iverson, an Edomite, tear.  All right?  Because she always claims her... She even admitted that she claims an Asian ethnicity on her college applications, et cetera, to pay less and all these other things.  All the benefits that came from being a woman and a minority.  But yet her father's an Edomite.  All right, so she's Anita Mike.  You are whatever your father is, something we're trying to get these idiotic BOIs to understand, all right, who are constantly on our channels with that nonsense.  But nevertheless, we're going to let Esau's tongue fall upon themselves, all right, as they... in this this video is called secret to reveal the u.s.  has a plan to house maduro so they're pretty much admitting that they call the all the death of you.  when you think about all the death and the loss of property the animal deaths the prison riots destruction of property you know all the zoo animals were eaten eaten.  The cats and dogs were eaten.  All the destruction, rape, and all the horrible things that has happened in Venezuela over these last couple years is all the fault of Esau Edom.  Kim's people.  Let's see the description, then we'll let this video play.  This is Jeremiah 49 and 10, and it reads, But I have made Esau bare.  I have uncovered his secret places.  And he shall not be able to hide himself.  His seed is spoiled and his brethren and his neighbors and he is not.  All right.  So the bear part and he can't hide himself.  That part is here.  The spoiling and him and him not being.  that's yet to come.  But that's close his hand as well.  So without any further ado, let's let Miss Kim Iverson tell on her people. ",

I know my last video was about this, of the Washington Post.  They were able to obtain a secret recording of a meeting that Mike Pompeo held, and this was not meant to be leaked.  There was not supposed to be any press, but it was secretly recorded and it was leaked to the Washington Post.  John Hudson, the national security reporter for the Washington Post, was able to secure this.  And it is a juicy, juicy audio recording.  And if you haven't heard it, I'm going to put the link down below and you can listen to it for yourself.  But in it, Pompeo talks.  He's addressing various aspects of U.S.  foreign policy.  So, you know, it's going to be good.  And he talks about, like I mentioned in the last video, meddling in UK's election to ensure that the Labour Party's Jeremy Corbyn doesn't become the next prime minister of the UK.  or one of the future Prime Ministers?

This is Mark 3 and 25.  Adam started 23.  And he called unto them and said unto them in parables, how can Satan cast out Satan?  And if a kingdom be divided against himself, that kingdom cannot stand.  And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.  And if Satan rise up against Satan himself and be divided, he cannot stand.  But have an end.  And Esau Edom is Satan.  Remember in Isaiah 14, when it was referring to Satan, to Lucifer, it says, is this the man that made the earth to tremble and kingdoms to shake?  You know, roughly paraphrase.  Is this the man?  So this man, the Edomite man, that race of people, the house of Edom, the race of Edom is against themselves. ",

The same thing he does with our history.  Not admitting that the so-called Negroes, who were Israelites, were the ruling class people in Europe throughout the Dark Ages and the earlier part of the Renaissance, prior to the Renaissance, the medieval times.  The hiding and covering up of history that the so-called Negroes here in America primarily make up the tribe of Judah, which was the tribe that the Lord came from.

Now, I'm not sitting here saying that Maduro is this really wonderful leader.  I don't think any leader is all that great.  I'm sure every government is filled with some corrupt jerk that's at the top, you know, to some level, some more corrupt than others.  And I'm sure in Venezuela, it's not that different.
