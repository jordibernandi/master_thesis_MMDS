They take those jobs away.  And also, when they go into our school systems, you know, a third of the class doesn't speak English in already struggling school districts.  I don't think it's going to make it any better.  And there's a lot of people that do come here unvetted, too.  So it's like there's no real upside.  It is helping people, but at the end of the day, the supply of people looking for a better life is in the billions globally.  So we can't say, oh, it's global poverty, we're helping these people.  That supply of people that want help will never end.  So we have to kind of draw a line and fix the problem so we can move forward, or else we'll just keep flooding the border and flooding the system. ",
