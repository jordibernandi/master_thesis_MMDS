The problems that I have had to deal with directly felt more solvable, as if the solutions were only just out of reach, the result of a lack of resources or information.  Enter the internet, a new tool that promised to bridge the information gap.  Scientists could easily reach the public civilians would have access to a whole world of books and ideas, and people all over the world could connect in cross-cultural exchanges.  To be fair, the internet brought some of that, but that's not all it brought.  There are measles outbreaks happening in Washington State and Oregon right now that have parents furious at people who refuse to vaccinate their kids.

            "text": "Oh dear.  You see, alongside providing us with unprecedented access to information, we've also been provided with unprecedented access to misinformation.  Anybody, anywhere, can say anything and blast it out to the entire world.  As a result, it's increasingly difficult to tell truth from fiction, even for well-meaning and educated people.  This has already had dramatic effects, from the resurgence of nearly eradicated diseases to compromised democracies.  Why is this happening?  How did our relationship with reality become so miserably fraught?  And how can we, the citizens of planet Earth, uphold the truth in a post-truth era?  Here to discuss this with me is Dr.  Tom Nichols.  He's a professor at the U.S.  Naval War College, a five-time Jeopardy!  champion, and quite a Twitter socialite.  In his book, The Death of Expertise, Tom lays out a series of arguments about what's happening, which he describes as a story of ego, erosion of mass media, and college campuses that have lost the plot.  Tom requested a disclaimer that he doesn't speak for the government.  I also wanted to add that the ideas discussed here on Indirect Message are always done in the spirit of inquiry.  a good faith attempt to figure out solutions together.  And so discussion shouldn't be confused with endorsement.  I hope you enjoy our conversation.  I wanted to start off by defining our terms and really making sure we're clear about what we're talking about.  How would you define an expert?  How can we know whether or not someone's an expert in their field? ",

When you say expert, they will immediately say, oh, you just mean somebody with a PhD like you.  to which I sometimes say, okay, sure, I do.  But I also mean other kinds of people.  Look, your plumber is an expert.  People forget that expert does not just denote someone in a profession.  It's someone who has authoritative knowledge about a subject.  It's the person to whom you would turn to advice.  There is some issue of credentialing.  In some fields, it's an academic degree.  In some fields, it's a certificate.  But there's also things like peer affirmation.  You're an expert because other people who are good at this have determined that you are an expert.  You know, if you go to a doctor, why does it matter that your doctor is a board certified pediatric surgeon?  It means people in that specialty who monitor each other and submit each other to examination and review have decided to put their imprimatur on you. ",

And, you know, one thing that's important for experts to admit right up front is that there are bad experts, that there are just people who suck at this.  But here's the thing, and this is when the death of expertise problem becomes acute.  Late people think that the answer to a bad expert is to become an expert themselves in five minutes by, you know, Googling something.  The cure for bad expertise is to seek out better experts.  If you think about how a lot of the big failings among expert communities have been called out, you know, who finally understood why the space shuttle blew up that day?  Other engineers, investigators, people who understood how a space shuttle is put together.  But the other problem is this, and I think this is really a much broader problem, that we want to take advice we already agree with.  That confirmation bias is the strongest.  It's stronger than gravity.  It's stronger than a black hole.  Because people don't go to the internet for information.  They go to the internet for confirmation. ",
