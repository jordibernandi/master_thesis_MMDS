There's a window on the road, ah, Guailuo.  I'm waiting for Renyueluo.  Ah, Su, Sa, Ma, Zuo, Zuo.  .  .  Ah.  If you say that you are happy, you will be happy too.  If you say that you are happy, you will be happy too.  The sun comes out and it's hot and hot, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Thank you.  Chanting Chanting .  .  ah ah .  .  I send my little sister to the road, my friend Ah Guai Luo.  My little sister wants me to hug Ren Yi Luo.  Do you want to ask my uncle, Ah Guai Luo?  Even Sun Teng doesn't dare to say Ren Yi Luo.  Ah Su Se Ma Zuo Zuo.  My little sister sends me to the road, Ah Guai Luo You want to move around, my friend Ren Yi Luo.  This one was the first one I ever heard.  So... To me, this reminds me of something.  I actually translated this before, back in the old days, probably in 2013, but back then I didn't even have this channel, so I don't even know where the translation went.  I wrote it in a comment and I went back to the original video because it was the top voted comment for a while, but I don't know where that comment went.  You see, Google forced Google Plus on everyone.  So I think because I commented it on Google Plus while tagging the video, something happened recently the past probably four years when they stopped the Google Plus tethering.  So maybe my comment got buried or something.  but this video has the most slang out of all the ones that we've heard so some of them I unfortunately couldn't translate well so I just left it blank.  and if any of you speak those southern dialects then let me know or let the audiences know because you will help the audiences a lot now.  one last thing to note is that I lost my train of thought.  I don't even know what I was going to say.  Oh, this is what I was going to say.  So if you notice, it's just the girl in front and the guy singing.  The girl in yellow in the back just kind of dancing.  She doesn't utter a word.  It's not like you've seen these three before, right?  There's other... Videos where both the girls are singing but in this one the girl is literally dancing Kind of not even to the beat.  it almost sounds like she's just dancing or looks like she's dancing to another song.  so I found that really funny.  the fact that she never sings and She's kind of dances.  I don't know.  I mean maybe they just.  this is part of the troll.  that's part of the humor of this video.  Anyways, if you guys want more translations of these funny Yunnan folk songs, let me know.  I might do some more.  Talk to you guys soon.  And I don't know what I'm going to say.  Bye-bye. ",
