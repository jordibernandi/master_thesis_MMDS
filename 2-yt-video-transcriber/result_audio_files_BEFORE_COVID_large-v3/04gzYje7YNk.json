Now, that's a that's a reckless statement.  I don't think Trump knew what Epstein was up to at the time.  But there's a complete difference between idle talk on the one hand or even Acosta's allegedly negligent prosecution and the people who participated in the sex ring.  And here, I think one name that seems kind of conspicuously absent is Bill Clinton.  We're learning, first of all, that Clinton took a number of flights, a lot more than we thought, to Epstein's sort of sex island.  Clinton, of course, denies it, but\u2014 AMY GOODMAN.  Yeah, I'm going to get to that, Dinesh.  Right. ",

But Dinesh, The Washington Examiner reporting tonight that the flight logs reveal Clinton took 27 flights on Epstein's private jet during at least six different trips, two of which were without Secret Service agents.

And so, therefore, this is worth looking into.  So, while the media is focused on Trump and Acosta, the Clintons, who have eluded the posse for 40 years, are not even being called to account on this one.  There's a photo in social media of Ghislaine Maxwell, the kind of procurer of young women for Jeffrey Epstein.  There she is in the front row at Chelsea Clinton's wedding.  So there's a clear connection here, a documented connection.  And we'll have to find out who's lying, Clinton or the airline logs.  AMY GOODMAN? ",
