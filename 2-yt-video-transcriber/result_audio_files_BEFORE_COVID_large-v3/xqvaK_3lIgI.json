You are granted the privilege of taking up more fucking space.  I'm glad you brought up burden because the burden you're putting your body under is something you should actually do something about.  You are under burden the entire time.  Any obese person is under an unneeded amount of burden due to their own body weight.  It is just facts.  Complaining about anxiety because of your choices.  They are your choices.  Makes you feel like you don't have a place on this earth.  fucking please.  Are you kidding me?  You're in the majority.  You're in the vast majority.

I really did.  Like you'd be walking down the airline aisle and you'd be looking and there would always be that person who like you locked eyes with and you realized they were sitting next to you.  And that poor person, which normally for some reason seemed to be a person my size also, we knew we were about to like get like intimately, you know, acquainted with each other because we were going to be touching each other the whole time.  Because I am taking up more space than the seats were designed for.  And I know this.  And I knew this.  So I did whatever I could to sit sideways or whatever to make sure that the person who paid the same amount of money as me Who actually takes up less space.  I made sure I wasn't trying to take up their space because they paid the same I did.  It's not their fault that I am bigger than them, that I'm taking up more space than what is allotted to the money I paid.  So therefore, I felt like shit and I did not blame them for being upset that I was actually taking up a big portion of their space when I couldn't avoid it.  The thought concept that they're upsetting you by them being upset that you're taking up more space than they're taking up while they pay the same as you is egregiously a privilege, if you ask me.  You think because you're larger, you should be privileged to their space, to more space than them because you're larger.  That is asking for a privilege, if you ask me.  That means you think you deserve more space than them, you deserve more for the same amount of money.  It's the same thing as that crazy lady talking about the fat tax and how plus size clothes cost more because they use more material.  It's just stupid shit like that that makes people think that this is ridiculous because it is.  And you're sitting there thinking like, oh, they're making you feel uncomfortable.  Lady, if you are encroaching upon their space, you are making them feel uncomfortable. ",

So you have the privilege of having entire companies based around what you should wear.  That's an entire privilege of entire companies based around overweight and obese women.  To be real, Fit women do not have that.  They really, really don't.  It is hard.  My wife will shop for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours for a pair of jeans.  And they'll either be too long when they actually fit her waist and thighs and butt, or they'll be too short when, I mean, it's an impossible thing for her.  We will shop for hours and hours and hours for her to find nothing that actually fits her because for the most part, Since fit women are in the minority, for the most part, there is nothing for them to purchase.

Seeing as how, again, 70% of the country, 70% of both of our countries, of the UK and the United States, are overweight or obese, I'm pretty sure that everybody in there looks very similar to you.  While I personally love Dunkin' Donuts, love you, motherfucker, and coffee.  Oh, God, I love the fucking coffee.  But... I stay away from the donuts because as a former fat person, I want to make sure that I'm not fat anymore because you know why?  I like life.  I want to live for a while.  You are each sitting there eating a donut the size of your head and you're wondering why people are staring at you because you're eating a donut the size of your head.  That's not even moderation, just to be real.  You are obese.  You should not be eating donuts.  People may be looking because you are already obese.  You've eaten enough donuts.  You should try to get to a healthy lifestyle.  And two, just be clear.  If you think you get discriminated against or you get looked by that, try bringing broccoli and fish to work in a Tupperware container sometime.  Try being around a bunch of people, like just the average population trying to only order like the veggies and a protein at dinner and watch in amazement.  watch as you you know when you say no I'm not gonna have any of the breadsticks today.  when you go to Olive Garden or wherever watch the looks of the people's faces watch the look on the server's face when you're like no I'm not having that you know they'll remark on oh we're a healthy eater.  or oh you know.  oh you know You should live a little because you're already thin.  You act like you get discriminated against for eating a donut.  I'm pretty sure that that is ridiculous.  I'm pretty sure that that shit's in your head for the most part.  People may say something to you like, maybe you shouldn't.  That's because maybe you shouldn't.  Maybe you shouldn't.  But I can tell you this right now.  When you try to eat healthy, it is, first of all, way harder because most menus are not focused around healthy eating.  But two, people look at you a lot more crazy in today's society than if you eat a cheeseburger.  If you eat a cheeseburger, normal.  Most people eat those weekly.  If you eat fish and broccoli, there must be something wrong.  Are you training for something?  Did you get some bad test results?  No, motherfucker, I just want to be healthy.  You know, like I'm an amazement at how, again, a person that does something that the majority of people do, like in any office right now, if you're in an office right now watching this, I guarantee you there's some sort of Danish or donut somewhere in that office.  If you have an office full of people, somebody thought to bring them.  It's totally the normal. ",

You do not need to post pictures to Instagram if you do not like the results.  You don't.  You absolutely do not.  You do not need to subject yourself to that.  That is a choice.  Again, just like how much you overeat.  A complete and total choice.  You do not get the right to bitch about your own choices.  You're being held accountable for your own choices.  That's actually what we call adulting.  And since you are an adult, even though you're one that apparently does not want to take responsibility for their own actions in life... Unfortunately, that's not how life works.  I'm unfortunately the one apparently to have to inform you and the rest of you obese or overweight people out there that think that for some reason because a person takes care of themselves, watches what they eat, works out, there's some sort of privilege connected with that.  That is not a privilege.  A privilege is something that's given.  When you work out to be healthy and take care of your own weight and take care of your own health and take care of your physicality, That is earned. ",

That is something you earn.  Just like the person that is thin earns it.  It truly is ridiculous.  The two differences, the difference is that a thin person saying you're unhealthy can say that.  You know why?  Facts.  I mean, it is just scientific proven fact that being overweight and obese is unhealthy for you.  It is just fact.  It's physics and fact.  Just the same way as being dramatically underweight.  is unhealthy for you.  it is just fact.  people i mean we are.  we live in a society where we just want to look past this.  i say this all the time and i truly mean this.  and if you are watching my video and if you are upset by me picking on this woman which i am not doing i am just stating facts I would rather hurt somebody's feelings by telling them the truth than watch them die by telling them a lie.  And that's just my two cents on the matter.  My name's Alan Roberts.  Hit me up on Instagram at EveryDamnDayFitness.  Hit me up on Twitter at EveryDamnDayFitness.
