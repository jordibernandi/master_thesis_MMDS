            "text": "I don't want to follow that.  So I'm here to talk a little bit about the law and about how the organization that I'm a part of, which is Women's Liberation Front, has been engaging in some aspects both in the courts, in litigation, as well as on the legislative side.  And I will also just say, in addition to being a member of the Women's Liberation Front, which is a far left radical feminist organization, I'm also a member of Hands Across the Aisle, which is which is a bipartisan coalition of women who disagree, as Ryan said earlier, profoundly on many issues.  And we set those aside because we have many shared concerns about the impacts of gender identity ideology, specifically for women and girls.  So going back to May 2016, going back further, we have, oh, let me.  So let me also say, Most people in the room probably know there's a law on the books called Title IX, which is Title IX of the Civil Rights Act.  And its intention specifically is to protect women and girls in the educational arena because women and girls had been excluded from and discriminated against within the educational arena for so long.  So feminists and other women fought very hard to get Title IX enacted into law in 1972.  And it is specifically to protect women and girls.  And it says that in the educational arena, There can be no discrimination on the basis of sex.  It specifically uses that word.  And Title IX accompanies some implementing regulations that say that even though the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, it is appropriate for institutions that receive federal funding to have sex-segregated spaces like bathrooms and locker rooms.  So sex-segregated spaces are specifically allowed under Title IX and its implementing regulations.  OK, so fast forward to May 2016.  Then President Obama issued what was called a guidance letter to institutions that received Title IX funding.  And what that guidance said was that institutions that receive federal funding under Title IX were supposed to interpret the word sex in Title IX to mean gender identity.  The Obama administration did this with no notice in common.  There was no opportunity for the public to respond.  And what that guidance effectively would have done is obliterated the regulations that allow for sex-segregated spaces.  So the Women's Liberation Front sued.  We filed a lawsuit in New Mexico called the Women's Liberation Front versus the United States of America.  And we were well prepared to proceed with that lawsuit.  And we essentially made two arguments.  One is that the Obama administration's failure to get any public input into this change constituted a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act.  And further, we argued that interpreting the word sex to mean gender identity for Title IX purposes was really, really bad for women and girls in institutions that received federal funding.  Those were our arguments.  The current administration has withdrawn that guidance.  And so as a result of the withdrawal of that guidance, our case was dismissed with our permission.  We understood our case just became moot with the guidance not in place.  However, Schools across the country are very, very confused because even though they understand that that guidance is no longer in place, there's still a lot of evolving questions about how schools are supposed to deal with claims of discrimination brought by trans-identified students.  And so what we're seeing is across the country, some trans-identified students are suing their schools and their school boards and their school districts.  And this litigation is sort of percolating up through the courts.  And we don't have a definitive word from the Supreme Court yet.  Even though our lawsuit was dismissed, Women's Liberation Front has continued to engage in litigation efforts by filing front of the court briefs.  We did that in the case that some of you may have heard of called Gloucester.  It's a case in Virginia.  that's in federal court.  We've done it in a few state court cases.  And we did it in this case.  This is called Boyertown, Boyertown versus Sorry, it's called Joel Doe versus Boyertown Area School District.  So in this case, a group of students actually sued their school arguing the opposite.  So in most of the cases that we see, it's a trans-identified school suing, trans-identified students suing their school when the school has not allowed the student access to opposite sex spaces.  Boyertown is different.  In Boyertown, a group of students who want sex segregated spaces sued their school because this young woman walked into the girls' room and there was a boy.  And she didn't like that.  She was concerned about that for her own safety.  And she was concerned about that for the safety of her sister and other girls in the school.  And so she decided she wanted to sue.  She's incredibly brave.  Her name is Alexis Lightcap.  And of the students who schooled the Boyertown School, Alexis is the only one with the bravery to use her name publicly.  And she's written about this in local media.  And she's fantastic.  Why is this such a concern?  So I get this question from my liberal friends and family all the time.  They think I'm crazy.  They're like, why do you care if somebody wants to identify as the opposite gender?  Of course, they can never explain what they mean by identify as the opposite gender.  And even that formulation totally conflates the words sex and gender, which I think is inappropriate and illogical.  But my liberal friends and family are always asking me, why do you care?  But the reason that I care is really, first of all and foremost, because of the parents whose stories Jennifer read, who are struggling so hard with this in their own families.  But I also really care because if sex is construed to mean gender identity, what that means is that nearly all sex segregated spaces, colleges, sports, dormitories, and women's rights in general will utterly disappear.  They will completely disappear.  And that is true whether the Supreme Court decides that sex means gender identity, which it might.  We hope it won't.  Boyertown may go before the Supreme Court.  We filed an amicus brief in support of the petition for certiorari.  And we're hoping that the Supreme Court will take it up in this case, in part because Alexis is so brave.  And she is standing firm for women's rights, privacy, and safety.  But whether the Supreme Court decides that sex means gender identity or the legislature decides that sex means gender identity, that is an unmitigated disaster for women and girls.  It is horrifying.  It means effectively that women and girls will no longer exist as a coherent category worthy of civil rights protection, and that is an absolute disaster for us.  Okay, so the court might decide that.  We hope the court will decide that sex means what most of us think it means, which is how Julia defined it.  We're also looking at the legislature, where there's a bill pending before both houses of Congress called the Equality Act.  We think that is a problem because we think equality is a very good thing.  Who would be against equality?  Everybody likes equality.  So this very innocuous sounding bill would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the legacy of Dr.  King.  It would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include gender identity as a legally protected category for civil rights purposes in places of public accommodation.  This would utterly obliterate female-only spaces throughout society.  The Equality Act would also require institutions that receive federal funding, which is many institutions in this country, it would require them to consider sex to mean gender identity for all purposes.  So the Equality Act, which sounds all well and good, is an unmitigated disaster for women and girls.  And the thing is, it is not possible to both enshrine gender identity in civil rights law and protect women and girls as a distinct legal category at the same time.  It's just not possible.  So with the Equality Act, though, Democrats have largely embraced it.  I think because they're well-intentioned and they support equality.  Equality is a good thing.  But I really don't think that Democrats in Congress have fully explored the potential consequences of what this law would mean if enacted.  And I hope that they will.  Okay, so finally, this is not about the law.  This is more about really the intellectual bankruptcy of gender identity ideology and the importance of language.  No one really knows what these words mean.  I have never gotten a definition of gender identity that is not either completely circular.  The Equality Act essentially defines gender identity as the gender that you identify with.  That's completely and utterly circular.  And it tells us nothing about what it means.  Or other definitions of gender identity rely on regressive, outdated stereotypes, sex-based stereotypes that have no place in our society.  from a feminist perspective.  People will say, a man who quote unquote identifies as a woman will say he does so because he's nurturing and compassionate and he likes to wear dresses.  That's absurd.  And frankly, it's insulting to women who have fought hard to get into the workplace, to wear what we want, to look how we want to look, to not wear makeup if we don't want to wear makeup.  It is incredibly insulting to say that a woman is someone who wears makeup and dresses.  Yet a lot of people on my side of the aisle will define gender identity in that way.  So essentially, gender identity is just utterly intellectually bankrupt.  It really doesn't have any meaning.  And we should not be basing civil rights laws on concepts that have no coherent meaning.  Feminists have fought really hard for our rights to vote, to serve on juries, to have sex-segregated spaces, and we're not giving them up easily. ",
