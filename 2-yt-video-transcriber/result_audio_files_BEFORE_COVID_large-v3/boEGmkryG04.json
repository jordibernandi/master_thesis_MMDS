            "text": "Hey everybody.  I flew into Washington, D.C.  on a red-eye with 108 8th graders last night, but I was able to download and watch Logan Paul's video, Flat Earth to the Edge and Back, on the flight, and I thought I'd take a couple minutes to give you my thoughts.  But first off, let's see a show of hands.  how many of you out there actually thought Logan Paul was a flat earther.  Come on, be honest.  Yeah.  Well, as predicted, Logan Paul's 50-minute documentary was released yesterday, and lo and behold, it was a 100% fabricated journey of self-discovery, with the only genuine moments being the interactions with actual flat earthers.  And I have to say, well done, Logan Paul.  Look, Man, I don't know your work.  I'm not in your target demographic.  You are known as a kid's entertainer that does tremendously stupid things, but obviously you are not stupid.  You played these globe deniers like a fiddle and once again made them look foolish.  And for that, I thank you.  Now, to be honest, the video itself is mediocre.  Though its production is high, it looks really slick, it was well-structured and edited quite well.  The writing and acting, however, is sub-par.  Five minutes in and nobody is buying that this is real.  People just don't talk like that.  And so, in that way, it was meh.  But knowing the context in which this was created made this very entertaining for me.  From start to finish, this was Logan Paul and his crew laughing at the concept of being a Flat Earther and becoming a Flat Earther.  His friend Mike just randomly drops some Flat Earth nonsense, like with no foreplay or anything, and when Paul doesn't buy into it, Mike immediately... Spoilers ahead.  This isn't Avengers Endgame, so I've got no problem spoiling this thing.  So Mike goes into a globe-breaking, or shall I say, globe-busting rampage in the middle of the night.  And then he tells a story about growing up in Antarctica and there being restricted areas because of, you know, the Antarctic Treaty, and how one day he saw his little friend fall off the edge of the earth.  As he tries to convince Logan, there are a number of little gems, from the Flat Earth shrine that Mike had hidden behind a bookshelf that looked like the walls and the background of about a third of every Flat Earthers video out there, to his taking a spirit level on a plane and holding it up to the window to test the horizon, to these stupid beach ball references, to all the parroting of the Flat Earth talking points with a straight face while sprinkling in their own original nonsense here and there.  And then what really converts Logan Paul?  The attention of a girl.  Just the personification of the flat earther's need for attention, affection, and human contact.  And then just toward the end, his buddy Mike says, it was all a joke, but Logan is just so gullible that he fell for the whole thing.  And Logan feels like an idiot, and then he ends up discarding the flat earth and becomes a no-earther.  Damn.  Separated from the context of the moment, this video wouldn't really hold up.  But right now, funny shit.  Just another case of Flat Earthers ending up with egg on their face.  A lot of Globe Deniers started hedging their bets with him because they didn't want to get burned, but you could tell they were holding out hope.  Especially you Globe Deniers that commented on my other Logan Paul videos.  You thought you had one.  But alas, always the bridesmaid.  But hey, as I've said, just the fact that Logan Paul is talking Flat Earth will help it trend higher and get you more attention.  And that's all you really want.  Right?  That's my job!  That's what I do!  I don't lose!  I win!  I win!  Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?  Maybe you came by congratulating him on his victory. ",
