            "text": "Thank you, Jesus.  Jesus is coming soon.  Sooner than most people think.  I don't see how you can look at everything that is going on in the world and not see that we're living in a time where you probably should be praying harder than you ever prayed before.  I don't see how you can look at the wickedness in the world and think that it's time to be a casual Christian.  Casual Christians will become casualties.  I don't see how you can look at what's happening in the political world.  What's happening with Christians going to court?  What's happening with all these different groups that are rising up and think that, oh, we're going to be fine.  No, there's a collision that's coming.  I've been talking about it for a while, but, you know, this LGBTQ thing, you know, you want to say they came out the closet.  They're not going back.  They're looking to gain ground, gain territory, protesting in Chick-fil-A, taking Christians to court.  It just hasn't hit you yet.  I've seen an article today where they say couples are having babies just to have abortions.  I saw a video the other day where people, females were singing on a bus about abortion like they were in church.  You see kids, five years old, six years old, being confused.  Oh, dressed like a boy, dressed like a girl.  Toys being made, a Barbie doll that is gender neutral.  You can make it be whatever you want it to be.  No, you're what God says you are.  I don't see how a Christian could look at any, see, but this is what most Christians are doing.  I don't wanna hear it, don't talk about it, because we're so comfortable.  Are you going to be like the woman, the virgins who had the oil burning, the lamp ready?  Are you going to be one of those people?  I don't want to hear it, Brother Marcus.  I don't want to talk about it.  Whether you want to admit it or not, there is stuff that is happening.  There's a war that is going on.  There's a war for territory.  There's always been a war for your soul, but it's going to come to your doorstep.  And I'm here to tell you, as I feel the Holy Ghost just going through my body right now, Jesus is coming soon.  But before he comes.  This earth is going to be shaken with the power of God.  The Bible says that this earth is groaning.  It's desperate for the sons of God to stand up, the daughters of God to stand up and manifest.  God is raising up some people who are going to walk in real power and real authority.  And you know what?  People say, oh, you're too radical.  You're too crazy.  Okay.  We'll see when the legislation.  Oh, don't get involved in the politics.  Okay.  We'll see when the laws start getting passed down.  And it affects your job.  It affects your kids at the daycare.  Do you know that there's a daycare?  I think it's here in Chicago where they said, look, we don't want you to call them boys or girls anymore.  No, no.  Call my son a boy because that's what he is.  Don't confuse my kids.  Yeah, but you don't think it affects you.  Everything that you see happening, the Bible says when you see these things happening, look to the sky for your redemption, draweth nigh.  It doesn't say to do this, oh Marcus, I don't want to talk about it, brother Marcus.  I don't want to see it, don't show it to me.  No, it says when you see these things happening, look to the sky for your redemption, draweth nigh.  You say, well, brother Marcus, they've been saying Jesus is coming forever.  But it says one day to him is like a thousand years.  He sits outside of time and space.  They said, Brother Marcus, thousands of years have passed.  It might have been only a day to him.  This is why he says, lean not to your own understanding.  But before he comes.  I'm telling you, he's about to raise up some people that are bold, that are unashamed.  They're going to walk in book of Acts power.  They're going to be walking this earth like Elijah and Elisha coming against the Jezebels, coming against the Ahabs.  Man, I feel the Holy Ghost.  It says, these signs shall follow them that believe.  They'll speak with new tongues.  They'll cast out devils.  But in church, we just want to hear a motivational message.  It doesn't say they might follow.  It doesn't say it will follow some of them.  It says these signs shall.  We about to start casting out devils.  It's going to be the norm to see it.  It happens in Africa.  It happens other places.  People are getting healed other places, but here in America, we're too comfortable.  We want to pick and choose what we hear about.  We want to pick and choose what parts of the Bible that we want to apply.  Christians shouldn't be involved in politics.  That's the biggest lie of the devil to deceive the church.  That's what the devil wants you to do.  The Bible says be not ignorant of Satan's devices.  He wants you to do this while he's making moves so that he can hit you with the surprise and you're not ready and a casual Christian will be a casualty.  Because you know what's going to happen?  It's going to surprise you and you're going to get in your feelings about it.  And instead of walking by faith, you're going to walk by sight.  You're going to walk by what you feel.  The Bible says that Satan comes as an angel of light.  How can you not see it?  How can you look at what's going on in the world and not see it?  I'm going to tell you why.  Because most people, they don't want to see it.  Oh, Jesus, help them.  How can you not see that?  there is a group of people, and I'm not getting political, there's a group of people, the Bible says the spirit of the Antichrist is already moving about the earth.  It's already moving about the earth.  Brother Marcus, what is the spirit of the Antichrist?  Anything that comes against God.  So if God said a man is a man and a woman is a woman and a marriage is between a man and a woman, anything that comes against that is the spirit of the Antichrist.  If the Bible says that I knew you in the womb, I formed you in the womb, and people say we're going to kill you in the womb, that's the spirit of the Antichrist.  But we vote for it.  We support it in ignorance.  We say, oh, well, who are we going to choose?  We don't really have a good option.  Let me tell you something.  If it was clear cut, if it was black and white, then you wouldn't have to walk by the spirit.  Many Christians are going to be deceived because they're not walking by the Spirit, because they don't fast, because they don't pray, because they don't study to show themselves approved.  They don't spend no personal time with God.  Everything they know about Christianity is what they heard from somebody else behind the pulpit.  Everything that they know about Christianity is what somebody else told them.  A Facebook post, something.  But what do you know for yourself?  When is the last time God gave you a revelation?  The same spirit that raised Christ from the dead that is in me is in you.  Is it operating?  Violence, crime, young people who have lost natural affections.  The Bible talks about this in Timothy.  These young people will kill you and not feel bad.  Beat up an elder and not feel bad.  Fight a teacher.  Don't respect teachers.  Don't respect police.  Don't respect anyone.  Everything over sexualized.  Can't even go to a store and find something modest for your daughters to wear.  Then check this out the other day.  Free the nipple movement.  Women want to walk around topless.  You don't need to go to the strip club no more.  Right?  Because they're going to show you for free.  All of this stuff is the spirit of the Antichrist, which is preparing the stage for the Antichrist to come out.  If you don't see it is because you don't want to see it.  Everything is there for everything the Bible prophesied about to happen to happen.  We are so close.  Why would you play with God?  Why wouldn't you get a serious prayer life?  Why won't you start fasting?  Why won't you start seeking him for real?  This is not the time to play with God.  This is not the time to be ignorant.  This is not the time to just walk around with whatever you feel.  I feel, I feel.  God is looking for.  somebody says, look, what I might ask you to do is gonna do the opposite of what you feel.  Ah, what a sad day it's gonna be.  The Bible says that a fool says in his heart, there is no God.  God is the realest thing, man.  The realest thing.  Can't nobody tell me that God isn't real.  I sit in these classes.  They talk about evolution.  They talk about, you know, oh, the earth started with this big bang and all these asteroids, right?  Ball of fire and the asteroids just hit the earth.  Watch this.  The asteroids hit the earth and somehow they cooled down and somehow the carbon and water, they just begin to multiply and create life.  Let me ask you something.  Where did those asteroids come from?  for these people who claim to know it all, who don't believe in God?  The asteroids that you're saying hit the earth, where did that come from?  The carbon and water that you said was there, where did that come from?  You can tell me, oh, you're 100% sure that this is where the earth started?  I feel the Holy Ghost, man.  How is it that the earth is the perfect distance from the sun that we don't burn up and we don't freeze?  How is it that the earth just so happens to have water that we need to survive and oxygen that we need to survive?  Oh my goodness.  How is it that we can reproduce?  How is it that we have a moral compass and you know what's right and wrong?  How is it that we have emotions?  Oh, God is real.  And he is coming.  Don't let this world water you down.  I know the world is saying one thing, but what does the word of God say?  God is looking for somebody that he wants to use to walk in real power, to walk in real authority.  Jesus said, you see these things I've done?  You will do greater.  Oh, help us, Lord.  You know what the problem is?  Instead of looking at what the word of God says and following that, we want to follow culture.  We want to follow skin color.  We want to follow what's popular.  We've got all these watered down gummy bear churches in America.  And the Lord is not pleased.  He's looking for somebody.  He's looking for somebody who's going to be the real deal, my brothers and sisters.  He's coming soon, and I hope that you're ready.  There's a war going on.  You can ignore it.  You can act like you don't see it.  But there's a war going on.  You better wake up.  You better pay attention.  You better find your place on the battlefield.  Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand.  It's at hand.  And tomorrow's not promised to any of us.  Don't be deceived by what's going on.  Don't be the one that you follow something because it's a good idea, but it's not a God idea.  Just remember this, the devil is a master deceiver.  He's been doing it for a long time.  He knows how to come looking like the right one.  He knows how to come looking like justice and the solution and the answer.  You better walk by the spirit. ",
