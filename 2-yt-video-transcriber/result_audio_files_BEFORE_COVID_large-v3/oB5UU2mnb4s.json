            "text": "The Book of Sirach, Chapter 5.  Don't rely on your wealth or say, I have everything I need.  Don't count on your mind or strength to be able to pursue your desires.  Don't say, No one is my master.  YAH will certainly punish you.  Don't say, I have sinned, but nothing has ever happened to me just because y'all hasn't done anything to you so far.  Don't be so overconfident about y'all's forgiveness that you pile one sin on top of another.  Don't say he has so much compassion that he will forgive my many sins.  Since both mercy and anger come from him, sinners will feel the weight of his anger.  Don't hesitate to return to Yah.  Don't postpone your return for another day or else Yah's anger will suddenly strike you.  On the day you are punished, you will be destroyed.  Don't rely on money gained dishonestly because it won't help you in difficult times.  Don't winnow every time the wind blows or follow every path you see.  This is what two-faced sinners do.  Stand firm on what you know and be consistent in what you say.  Be quick to listen, but slow to answer.  If you know what to say, then answer your neighbor.  But if you don't, then keep your mouth shut.  Both honor and disgrace come from talking.  A big mouth can get a person into trouble.  Don't be accused of being a gossip or use words to trap people.  A thief will suffer shame but a two-faced person will be severely condemned.  Don't say anything that hurts a lot or a little. ",
