            "text": "Hey everyone, I'm Diana Davison, advocate for the falsely accused and wrongfully convicted.  I'm going to talk about an article I just wrote for the Post Millennial, and I'll put a link below so that you can read the whole thing.  The basics are this.  Just when you think things can't get any crazier in the courtrooms of Canada, it happens.  First of all, I want to give a shout out to Clary Jackson for bringing this case to my attention.  She has an excellent YouTube channel and you should check it out.  I'll also put that link below.  So the case in question is called R versus Goldfinch.  For my American audience, the R stands for the freaking queen, Regina.  Yes, I know I pronounced that wrongly.  And our Supreme Court is being asked to do a few really ridiculous things.  Now I say ridiculous, but of course that's just my humble submission, as would be said in court.  So the first stupid thing, we're being told that a person accused of sexual assault should not be allowed to tell the judge or jury if there was an ongoing sexual relationship at the time of the incident.  Indeed, the prosecutor in this case suggested that we should call it Friends with Sleepovers instead of Friends with Benefits.  Second stupid thing, the Attorney General of Ontario said that witnesses should not be allowed to testify in their own words.  By that, I mean they are saying that the prosecutor should put words into the mouth of the complainant.  This is legally called leading the witness, and it's normally frowned upon.  But they want to do that in order to avoid having the accuser say something inconvenient.  By that, the AGO means, for God's sake, don't let her say something truthful that allows the accused to cross-examine her on it.  This is the same reasoning behind the restraining of police officers and police being told not to ask too many questions when someone reports a sexual assault.  Because the more the person says about the alleged event, the more likely it is that he or she is going to say something that screws up their credibility.  Now, I want to be clear that I do understand, as we all should, that sexual assault happens.  And it's a terrible crime with complex problems when it comes to evidence.  But what the hell is going on here?  What is the actual point of having someone testify in court when all they're allowed to do is act like a puppet for what the prosecutor scripted?  If the prosecutor and defense lawyer are going to predetermine the contents of witness testimony, why the hell do we even need a trial?  So that's my question of the week.  How much more stupid do we have to get before we can all agree that our legal system has gone to hell?  Donate to the Lighthouse Project.  Links are below. ",
