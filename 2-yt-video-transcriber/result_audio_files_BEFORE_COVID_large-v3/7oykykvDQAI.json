And when Watson chirps for a while and spits on the corporal, corporal decides to knock out Watson.  You can see for yourself. ",

            "text": "Okay, what's my take on this?  I'm just going to try to break this down for you real quick, make it edutainment.  Okay, here we go.  First, off-duty gigs.  I don't personally have this at any departments that I've worked for, but it is extremely common all over the country to where private businesses in a city, in a jurisdiction, will negotiate with the police department in the city to have uniformed officers present at their establishment or for their event so that, you know, Peace is maintained and there's a presence there to deter criminal activity at their establishment or their event.  That's what Ostman was doing.  He was working at this bar.  Now, so they're not technically on duty while they're doing this, answering police calls and all that stuff.  However, they still have to follow the policies and procedures of the department.  They still are representing the police department that they have the uniform on for.  Second thing, this is important.  I'm getting to what I think about this particular situation, but there's a couple of lessons to learn in this.  Just because someone's in handcuffs doesn't make them no longer dangerous by default.  I can break these cuffs.  You can't break those cuffs.  Okay, you may stumble upon a video or you may actually stumble upon seeing cops struggling with someone who's already in handcuffs.  And your thought is, he's already in handcuffs.  Why are they still fighting with them?  Why are they still doing that to him or her or Zur?  The reason is because they can bite.  Thank you.  They can kick.  They can still reach in a lot of times, depending on how flexible they are.  And maybe they have a weapon.  Maybe they're trying to get to a weapon.  Maybe they're trying to get to somebody else's weapon.  There's a lot of factors that just because someone is in handcuffs doesn't make them not dangerous.  Spitting.  It's an assault, at least in Michigan.  It's definitely an assault to spit at someone.  Not only is it disgusting, but the reason it is potentially... An assault is because it's bodily fluid that could contain disease, okay?  If you got blood in your mouth, especially from barf bite, and you're spitting, it gets in my eyes, my mouth, or whatever else, that's disgusting and potentially dangerous, potentially deadly, depending on what's in there.  So it's a problem to spit on people.  At the very least, it's frowned upon.  And when you put these two things together, I mean, I've had people spit on me at work or try to spit at me.  at me or on me, and they haven't been handcuffed, and in that case, I would take them down.  Get down, get down.  I would defend myself in some capacity from that happening again, and in the process of doing that, I might take them down, maybe they hit their head, maybe they knock themselves out or they get knocked out as a result, or a struggle ensues, I'm injured, they're injured.  So injury can happen in use of force that escalates or results from spitting.  So that's important to know as a generality.  Now, this specific thing, I believe this officer was out of line and allowed the bar fighter that has detained Mr.  Watson to get under his skin after he taunts him, like you saw in the video, and I think he just got sick of it after a while, and he gets spit in the face, which is quite an affront.  You can be taken back when you get spit right in the face.  And he goes over the line, however, in this case.  Why do I think he went over the line?  Because ",
