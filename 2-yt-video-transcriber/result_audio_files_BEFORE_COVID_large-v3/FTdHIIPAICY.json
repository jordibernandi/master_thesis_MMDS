            "text": "everybody.  so owen and callie are getting to know.  you getting to know all about you.  it's like owen knows anything in the pen is off limits so he might want to deal with a rabbit otherwise like.  but he knows callie is in the pen so she's off limits.  owen is a very smart cat.  you're an amazing boy.  owen let me tell you oh no cuddles stop it cuddles retreat retreat.  it's like fine hey callie mama got your back.  it's like thanks mama.  Bunny nose close up.  Bunny nose close up.  And there's Owen overseeing the operations.  You're like the mayor.  You're like Jake's right-hand man around here.  Say I help maintain law and order amongst the folk.  Callie's very curious about Owen and Owen's very curious about Callie.  But thank God, Owen, like when it's in a pen, He's fine with it.  It's amazing.  He's an amazing cat.  You really is.  And you're so pretty.  You're going to grow in your winter coat soon.  You're going to look like Simba.  Hi, cat.  Oh, your bunny ears are up.  Oh, those big ears.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  She is one of the sweetest rabbits I have ever come across.  I kid you not.  She has such a sweet disposition.  So if I can take in a male... As a companion for her, I will because the pen is enormous and it can accommodate.  This is like a mansion for Callie, this pen.  Seriously, she already found herself a nice little burrow.  She's already made herself a nest, right?  Oh, there she goes.  Nope, I'm back.  Chomping on the hay, nice soft hay.  Up in here, Rowan, come on.  You want to get out?  He's like, thank you.  I come to visit you again, auntie, very soon.  Bye, Owen.  Owen and Noble the pig are good friends.  So yes, everybody else is kind of just, I'm filling up the pools.  Hi, Faith.  Look who I let out of the pen.  The mayor himself.  He'll be coming in soon.  Jake.  The mayor himself.  So he's out of the pen for a few minutes, and I'm changing all the water balls out there, digging up the whole area.  They're having a blast digging everything up, eating every last bit of greens they're eating, which is fine because this is the area, this square, that I allow all sorts of vegetation to grow for these guys.  So anyway, that's about it.  Up there is little... Snowball.  Snowball, Bentley gave you a funky hairdo.  We gotta do something about this girlfriend.  Oh my gosh, you look like Carrot Top.  You look like Carrot Top.  She's like, oh my gosh, do I?  Do I really?  And there's Cuddles.  Cuddles is on the hunt for flies.  She lives to hunt flies.  So, don't you dare go near the bunny.  Hello, Callie.  Hello.  Do you want some food?  Want me to get you some food?  So everyone can see you?  This is where I put all of her greens, her food.  My gosh, she ate.  I have a tomato plant.  She loves the leaves in the tomato plant.  Here we go.  Oh, for you.  You want some now?  No?  No?  No, she's busy foraging in the hay.  I'll just put it over by her nest.  Here's her nest.  She's under this board.  She's making a nest.  So I keep giving her hay to make the nest.  And then she's got a rabbit food.  I have it inside too, but I put some out here for her.  And all sorts of veggies.  So she's got it made here.  Callie.  You got it made, girlfriend.  Bunny tail close up.  Bunny tail close up.  Cuddles, I expect you to behave yourself.  Good girl.  Good girl.  Cowie is not doing anything to you, are you?  Say, I'm totally innocent, Mom.  Okay, everyone.  Have a wonderful day.  Say bye, Cowie. ",
