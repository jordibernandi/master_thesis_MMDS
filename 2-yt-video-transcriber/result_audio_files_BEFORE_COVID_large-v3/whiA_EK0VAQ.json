            "text": "What's up, everyone?  It's Ohan, and this week on Transtastic, we're doing reintroductions.  Allow me to reintroduce myself as Ohan from Transtastic circa 2016.  I don't know.  Check the archives.  Let's go back.  Wednesday's my birthday.  I'll be 28.  One of the reasons why I kind of fell off the YouTube, uh, posting train as I thought, like, do 28 year olds post to YouTube?  Like, is that a thing they do?  I feel like I'm a bit older, which is somewhat ridiculous to say, but older in the sense of YouTube transness, you know?  And honestly, Luke, I didn't even know, I didn't even know Luke was 22.  Just watch his intro video.  I was like, surely this man is 25.  But no, so I feel like a little bit old to be here.  Thank you for having me.  As far as what do I do?  I mean, without giving you too much creepy info about myself, I live in Brooklyn, New York.  I live here because I work here.  I somehow found myself in the field of video post-production, kind of unintentional, just meandered towards that.  And I think I've been doing that for six years now.  And I mean, not to sound cocky, but I've become good at it.  And I think that's the only reason why I'm doing it is because it's just like the skills that I have.  It's not something that I feel particularly close to.  Most of my colleagues have intentionally studied film and ended up where I go every day intentionally.  I didn't.  And so I do feel a little out of place.  I don't feel like it feeds my soul in any way.  It's kind of just something I show up and get done, go home and then fantasize about like being a dog trainer for the rest of my life and like owning a pit bull rescue in upstate New York and Chihuahua.  So those are my dreams.  I love dogs.  Don't have one.  So it's very exciting.  Thanks for sticking around for that.  I have to check on the time because I'm making pasta because I am an ambitious adult.  I'm a musician.  That does feed my soul.  So I play piano, guitar, drums, which is a newer one for me, but super fun.  I'm excited to get back in the YouTube community.  I'm pretty active on Instagram.  It's like really weird.  I feel like I live most of my life.  I'm not, what am I trying to say?  I'm not as out as I used to be.  Like in 2016 or 2015, it was like early on in my transition, one year-ish.  so and so everything was like super exciting and new and now I'm kind of in a place where like I pretty much move through the world as a man.  most of the time you know except for the occasional like sees the long hair from behind misgendering or like at the doctor.  but other than that it's like pretty just not as much a part of my life as it was.  the way that I found to be visible is through being engaged online and so for me that's Instagram And now hoping to get back into YouTube.  I don't really know.  I'm trying to start off small.  My 2019 New Year's resolution is to do less.  Do less 2019.  And so I don't know that I'm going to be posting every week.  I'm going to start with once a month.  See how that goes.  In terms of my transition, if anyone cares.  I mean, this is called Transtastic.  It's somewhat relevant.  I started testosterone in 2015, I think.  15?  Yeah.  Yeah.  2015.  I'm approaching my four years on T on April 24th or 5th.  That's been a while.  I had top surgery in 2016.  Didn't go so well massive understatement.  Check out my personal channel if you are interested.  I ended up getting a revision which was basically like a surgery do-over in 2017.  I'm content enough Like obviously bummed and wish that didn't happen, but given the circumstance, I'm happy with the outcome.  I'm interested in pursuing bottom surgery, but honestly It's a lot to emotionally process.  It's a lot to financially process.  It's just a stressful thing.  I'm stressed.  I like the gym.  I've turned into kind of a beef head.  Is that a phrase?  Yeah, I just find that weightlifting really helps my mental health more than anything, and so I'm trying to get muscles.  I don't really know where else this is going, but I suppose that's the whole point of this reintroduction is to just say, hey, we're here, we're posting, drop us comments, topic suggestions, whatever you want.  That's what we're here for.  That's why I'm engaging.  My pasta's boiling.  I can hear it.  So I'm going to go.  Thanks for allowing me to reintroduce myself.  And I'll catch you next time.  Bye. ",
