This probably looks really cool at night.  It's kind of rad.  Anyway, you might notice me shaking a little bit today.  I did so much.  I lifted so much yesterday that my muscles are dead.  I did chest and triceps at the same time, and I'm just dying.  Even my neck feels weird.  I did drop my resting heart rate about 10 beats in the last six weeks from doing cardio like every day.  I don't know how that progress will be forever, but it's pretty cool.  I'm sure eventually there will be like a plateau or something.  Huh.  See if I can see anything from this alley.  When I go back over to the better view.  Those are some really serious security cameras.  Or just some random industrial company.  Like, those are pretty gnarly.  Like, telco setups right there.  We're like, thanks.  I think they call those bullet cams.  Wait, bullet cams only face one way.  Usually, so somebody might have, that's weird.  Usually cameras that look like that, they're very narrow and focused.  Usually they don't turn.  Unless you're looking a long distance and you need like, three points to zoom in on that are all like a quarter of a mile away from each other, but... Whatever that camera's focused on, when it turns left, it's going to be looking at like the next building.  That's really weird.  Hold on.  I guess it works for them.  It's like just a bunch of tubes.  is what it looks like to me.  Nothing exciting.  there.  Some guy just started staring at me.  That could be an issue.  We'll see.  I think both these companies are basically the same.  Same company.  That's what I think.  Oh, they're tarring the roof or something.  That smells horrible.  That's a great song.  That Spotify radio thing is going crazy.  It's Shimon and Andy C, Body Rock Orient Express.  Whoever Andy C is, he does some good, like, drum and bass.  Kind of like the old pendulum, before they got all commercialized and weird.  All right, I like that walker line.  Maybe we just smoke break.  He's still walking back.  He's curious.  Building across the way.  I'm the owner of the building across the way.  Okay, cool.  Good for you.  Okay.  Congratulations. ",

And I'm playing detective.  Oh my God, that's hilarious.  So that's Blaine.  Now we're going to get all their info.  Sorry about that, I tripped on the crack on the sidewalk.  So this is Blaine.  Expositions, Exhibits and Exhibits, 114 South Berry Street.  And all I, you guys saw the video.  I aimed in their general direction three or four times.  Tried to be as nice as I could, but those guys are idiots, geez.  When the guy first came up to me, that was fine.  We talked.  We chatted.  I acknowledged his interest.  But, of course, if you don't bow down and give them exact reasons why you're doing what you're doing, they turn into Bruce Willis.  I hope Bruce Willis doesn't ever sue me or anything.  I think it's kind of hilarious, though.  Well, anyway, we saw Die Hard a few days ago.  like for the 18th time and i loved it so much.  kudos to bruce willis.  but why on earth is it my problem or my fault that you've got homeless people messing with your stuff over there first?  you have homeless people.  you've got no freaking fence over here.  you've got train tracks that go directly up to your building and you've got a door that's open.  you can see it from here.  that's why you've got a homeless problem.  it's not because of some guy across 150 feet away with the camera.
