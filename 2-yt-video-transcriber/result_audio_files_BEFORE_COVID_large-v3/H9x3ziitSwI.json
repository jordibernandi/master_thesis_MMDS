I mean, the Canadian system is administered at the province level.  So the province is sort of like the market.  Instead of having all these sub-markets attached to individual for-profit insurers at the provincial level, I that's how it's organized the UK has the National Health Service where they're actually.  they don't actually run the health care facilities but they're the ones who are contracting them.  so it's sort of like that.  the health care facility still a is its own entity.  it's not that you're going and the government is the employer of the doctor so to speak but their contracting with the health care facilities.  but the point I wanna make is that There are criticisms of all of these systems, but they're different ones.  So when we say the British and Canadian systems aren't that good.  Right.  Let's figure out in what ways each is not that good because they're different ways. ",

We're getting to this like Vox thing that's happening with Steven Crowder right now.  Are you responsible for the reaction to what you post?  Because if you look at what Steven Crowder said, for people who don't know the story, Steven Crowder got into it with this guy who is a writer for Vox, who is \u2013 he's gay.  His Twitter handle is Gaywonk.  Carlos Maza.  Yeah, so it's not that he's hiding that he's gay.  He talks about it all the time.  He's kind of effeminate.  And Steven Crowder mocked that, and he mocked that in these videos where he was \u2013 criticizing carlos's position on antifa specifically what i saw and in in doing that he called him uh this queer mexican this like and he's doing it in a ribbing way he's doing in a Tweets that came his way and apparently he got docked.  So people got his phone and they were saying debate Steven Crowder.  He was getting all these text messages in and all this hateful stuff that was coming his way.  So the question is Who is responsible for that hateful stuff?  If Steven Crowder calls him queer is What is queer? ",
