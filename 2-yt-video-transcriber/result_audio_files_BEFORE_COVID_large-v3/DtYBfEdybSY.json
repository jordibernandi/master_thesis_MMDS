You're an entitled little coward playing political dress up and hiding behind armed security while you tell the rest of us to get rid of our most effective means of protection.  However, that's not even the worst of it.  What's worse than Beto engaging in what in my mind amounts to premeditated treason is the fact that Beto was simply saying out loud what everyone else on that stage agrees with.  They were either too smart to say it or too afraid to say it.  But think about it.  Nobody checked Beto when he said this tomfoolery.  They just sat there twiddling their thumbs.  But make no mistake, they all agree with him.  Beto is just the idiot desperate enough to say it out loud in hopes of reenergizing his campaign with the extreme left.  All the other candidates talked around the issue and danced and shimmied because they all know if you want to boil a frog to death, you can't just put it in boiling water.  It'll just hop out.  If you reenergize really want to boil the frog to death, you put it in cool water and turn the heat up a little bit at a time.  A little bit of common sense gun control here, a little bit of reasonable gun law there, a sprinkle of some universal background checks, a dose of assault weapon ban, and before you know it, the entire Constitution is on fire.  The people are running around like a bunch of morons trying to figure out why they don't have any constitutional rights anymore.  I mean, we only wanted to get rid of the second one.  Yeah, you looney tunes.  The second one is the one that was protecting the rest of them.  But no, you let this fraction of a man stand up on an American debate stage and brag about violating the entire Bill of Rights.  And this was your response. ",
