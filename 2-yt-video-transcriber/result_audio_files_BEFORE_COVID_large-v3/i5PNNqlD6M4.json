The Seaway connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, For part of the year, it's frozen over.  Because of the waterway's unique challenges, the U.S.  Coast Guard requires commercial pilots of international ships on the St.  Lawrence and Lake Ontario to acquire a license proving their mastery of the seaway.  Captain Hite was well on his way to getting his license. ",

The job pays well, around $350,000 a year.  And a big reason why it's so lucrative is because the Association and the Coast Guard limit the pool of licensed pilots.  The fewer available, the more each pilot makes.  And what reason did the Association give for their rejection of Captain Hite?  He used some salty language. ",
