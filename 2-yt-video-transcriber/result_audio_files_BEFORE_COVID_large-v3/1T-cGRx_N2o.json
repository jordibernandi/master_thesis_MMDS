            "text": "Thank you.  Also, I'm personally a poet.  So, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What?  I got your name and badge number?  You just interacted with me, sir.  Chapter 41, Section 98D, I believe it is.  Sir, you don't want to look at me now?  See that, guys?  You got to know your laws.  Yeah, good.  He wants to wave at me being that way, and then he doesn't want to tell me who he is.  When he doesn't know, I have a really, really good tune.  Look at his car, at least, car number.  Thank you.  I just heard the call over here.  He was slumped over in his car.  I don't know if they got permission to search his car because I don't think sleeping in your car is illegal.  So I don't know why they're searching his car and having him do a field sobriety test.  He wasn't driving.  Officer Regan, thank you, sir.  Oh, let me get your badge number, too.  Yeah, I got an 83-time zoom, so you can't get away from it.  Yeah?  Oh, you don't have a badge number on there.  It's all right, I got your car number, too.  It's fine.  I'll be filing a formal complaint.  Yeah, I know.  You know that's a law to actually identify yourself, right, sir?  Do you know that?  You didn't answer me.  Oh, okay.  That's a good public servant.  That's great.  Really good interacting with the public.  You guys wonder why you have a bad name, right?  You really have a bad name, huh?  Really wonder.  Exactly, exactly.  No, he doesn't have to.  Freedom of speech, guys.  Freedom of speech.  I know.  Alright, see, here we go.  Here we go.  You're not impeding anything, guys.  You're harassing these teens?  Did they complain about them, sir?  Did they complain about them?  Are they saying anything to them or just you?  See you guys?  Record everything.  You guys have phones?  Record it all.  Record it all.  There you go.  Pull out your phone.  Record it.  Get his name, badge number, all that stuff.  Officer Regan.  I'm going to be out here making accountability for all you guys.  And I'm going to let all these youth know what their rights are and what they can and cannot do.  Because you guys do not.  28.  Officer region.  Yeah, you don't have a badge number on there, huh?  Why don't you guys have badge numbers?  You trying to intimidate me or something?  This is Salem Police, guys.  This is what you're gonna expect when you come to Salem.  Trying to intimidate?  That's just a comfortable way.  they, uh, put their hands on their belt.  It's not to intimidate.  What, do you got gang tattoos?  Yeah, I know.  You're going to do it now?  Before you do that, it's going to be public record.  I can FOIA request it.  Before you do that, if that's personal, I can get you a phone.  You think I can't?  It's public record.  You're on duty, right, sir?  Go ahead.  Record.  I'm going to FOIA request your phone.  I know my laws, bro.  Yeah, good.  You guys don't like us type of citizens.  Yeah, so you put it right away.  You don't want her to quote me.  Oh, okay, he's got the blue flag, too.  Thank you.  Look under Mass Accountability on YouTube.  Yeah, yeah.  Desert Highway Watch or whatever it is.  Yeah.  Don't watch mainstream.  Watch people like us on YouTube.  Yeah.  Mass Accountability.  I recorded a cop choking a person out 10 years ago.  Yeah, the CF, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're overstepping their boundaries, and that's why people like me are getting out there and doing this, so they don't mess with our rights.  What's that?  Yeah.  What's that?  Yeah, I know, you can't get in trouble for sleeping in your car if you're sleeping either.  Well, I'm listening to their walkie on here.  They just said he was slumped over in the front seat.  That could be sleeping.  You can't get in trouble for sleeping in your car.  He's doing the field sobriety test because he feels threatened because these thugs have weapons and everything.  That's what I'm saying.  They've been scared of this camera all day.  I've been down at the movie set and all that.  Yeah, mass accountability.  Look it up.  My first video went 16,000 views.  It went on Channel 4, 5, 7, Fox, all that.  Bad Salem Cops, it's called.  Yeah.  And they can't kick you off this property unless they actually complain about you.  And they can't go inside and ask them to complain, yeah.  Exactly.  It's private property, so they can ask you to leave, but the cops can't just ask you to leave.  Yeah, see this guy knows his stuff too.  I'm hoping I just saved this dude from getting arrested.  Officer Regan doesn't like me one bit.  Yeah, it's not law.  Unlike Officer Regan that broke the law and didn't tell me his name or badge number.  See?  Beat them with the law, guys.  That's it.  He's over here telling you guys not to listen to him when he just kicked you guys out of here illegally.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, I got him suspended for two weeks.  First video I ever did, got a cop suspended for two weeks.  Bad Salem cop.  Look it up.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let's see if it's open.  Not open.  Not an open container.  Oh, he looks frustrated.  They can't get him on anything.  That happened to me when I saw you.  The one that fell in.  Yeah.  No, I can't.  I'm not supposed to, but I did my first time I ever did it.  If I wish I knew, I didn't know my laws back then, I could have sued the shit out of the city.  I could have, big time.  My video got me off my charges, the other kids off the charges, and then the cops suspended.  So that's why it's very important.  Always film the police.  Photography is not a crime.  Yeah, I know.  I don't have my iPhone.  Always strap the GoPros.  Take out your cell phone.  Take your cell phone and just start recording.  I had a lady.  I had three people go to the police station that day.  that happened.  I had a concussion that day.  Oh, really?  There were three people that saw the cop take the bike and they went to this station.  Good.  Good.  That's what we got to do as the public.  We got to stick up for each other because they complain.  it's like a war against us versus them.  But, I mean, look at the attitude we get.  They're literally wearing a costume.  These guys, literally, they're wearing a costume and they're welfare recipients.  They get Massachusetts state checks.  They get government checks.  Yeah, they get government checks just like a welfare recipient because that's what they are.  Yeah, you wear a costume, like, what do kids wear on Halloween?  Little costumes, just like this.  600 bucks.  No, not for what it can do.  It can zoom away from seven miles.  83 times zoom.  No, we got a sergeant.  Sergeant on scene.  How you doing, Sarge?  Good.  Can I get your name and badge number real quick?  Awesome, man.  Appreciate it.  Officer Regan, you hear that?  Sarge is perfect.  Professional.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why you're still a deputy.  You like that one, right?  Look at that.  Let's get the smile.  You like that one.  Oh, a patrolman.  Sorry.  A patrolman.  Oh, we don't have sheriffs here in Massachusetts?  Essex County?  No?  Meatball?  More steroids. ",
