            "text": "six reasons you should never stack slabs or never buy a slab in the first place.  the fact that they can fall over is not one of them but they can fall over if you stack them.  we're going to talk about six reasons why you should never ever buy a slab coin.  first off if you do want to see a bunch of slab coins or raw coins or bullion or whatever Come over here to CoinZip, look up Greenhill's Classic Stampin' Coin Show, hit directions, and be there Sunday.  This video was inspired by true events that happened on YouTube.  And one of them is Silver Seeker's video on top five reasons to buy slab certified coins.  And that is what we're talking about.  Slab coins are certified coins.  They're encapsulated by NGC, PCGS, Annex, or ICG, NCS, which is NGC's Conservation, Those are the companies that are currently respected and hold the market value.  Now, the first reason, or number six, I should say, that you should not buy slab coins is because you don't like slab coins.  Just don't buy them.  If you don't like them, don't buy them.  I prefer coins in slabs, especially whenever they're really nice BU coins or they've been took out of a mint set or a proof set or key date coins.  I like them authenticated, protected, and then of value.  And when they bicker about the grade inconsistencies we see sometimes, you're always going to have inconsistencies as long as you have human beings grading coins.  That's the given.  Probably a 5% problem with grades that aren't exactly what the coin looks like, the same grade.  But the point of it is that I would rather have a coin in a slab than a coin in like a Whitman album.  Silver Eagles, for instance, any type of coin like that, I see them toning in these Whitman albums all the time.  Typically, in a slab, A coin will not tone.  I know of PCI toning, but in a NGC, PCGS lab, they typically won't unless they're subjected to heat and humidity, moisture, storage problems at first.  Also, the coins might have been dipped and not properly rinsed before they were put in the holder.  They could have been improperly handled.  They could have been breathed on, sneezed on, and then once they were put in there, they still have some gas, some atmosphere inside, some molecules, and they'll still react to something that was on the surface before it was slapped.  But if I had my choices, I'd just have the coin slapped.  I like raw coins.  You know, I'm kind of 50-50.  I like my slapped coins too.  And for business, I like the idea of being able to send a coin off and maybe get that grade.  You know, I've done it a few times.  So it helps to make a little bit more money in this business.  And number five on my list is a badly damaged or scratched holder.  I've seen it so many times.  Holders that's got gouges in them.  You know, obviously you can use slab renew, something like that, to repair it a little bit or maybe use something that shines headlights, you know, that repairs headlights, the lenses on a headlight, things like that.  But otherwise, I just kind of avoid it.  They've been mishandled.  They need to be re-holdered if they're even worth re-holdering.  And that leads me to number four, which is very important.  You don't want a slab that is so damaged that it looks tampered with.  I've seen, I did a video not too long ago on... a coin that was actually switched.  The coin was switched out.  The coin was a problem coin.  It was artificially toned and I noticed that the slab was broke open.  You can't see it here in this picture, but obviously there was damage to that slab and a coin can be switched out.  So you definitely want to watch out for that.  Look at the seams and things like that.  Make sure you don't buy a coin that's been switched out or a slab that is so damaged that you could tell it's been tampered with.  And then that leads me to number three.  And I think we've all seen this.  That coin shows somebody has a sticker over top of their grade and they think it's a higher grade and they got the next grade price on it.  So basically someone sends in a 65 and they think it's a 66.  They try to sell it for 66 money or a coin that didn't make dimple or proof-like and they still think it's proof-like or dimple.  They still try to sell that coin for that price, the higher price.  You want to avoid that.  Just don't do deals with that because the coin just, if it was misgraded, they just need to resubmit it.  If it's not worth it to them, that's fine.  Now I get it, between you and that seller, if you think it's dimple too and you want to pay that price, that's fine.  I recommend avoiding that.  Next, number two reason to avoid buying slab coins is if it's in a fake grading company, an alphabet grading company.  We see them all the time on eBay.  It used to be a worse problem than it is now because they were allowed to put the names in there.  It's been a little bit of a crackdown, but I have lists of all the companies that that are legit here too, but also have a lot of them that are not.  I mean, AccuGrade.  at one time, people liked, but you can, you're going to have to buy the coin here.  But don't think that if you buy one of these AGS or one of these cheap, you know, I see a lot of people ask me about AACGS coins.  You know, they're just companies that are grading their own coins.  You know, Blanchard at one time, they didn't seem to be accurately graded.  They were just a company though.  They weren't a grading service.  They guaranteed their grades and And offered the services for you to submit coins and things like that.  So you've got to watch out for the fake grading companies.  And folks, this leads me to the number one reason you should never buy a slab coin.  And that is fake PCGS NGC annex holders.  Right here.  Chinese starter kit.  Can you imagine that?  I've actually had emails saying I can make any slab you want, any coin in it you want.  You know, they're taking orders for this.  I mean, they'll go out and make your coin.  Let's say you want a real rare 1893S, and they'll stick it in a fake PCGS slot for you with a real serial number.  You know, so it's very important to watch out what you're buying.  You don't want to buy a fake holder.  Definitely, Silver Seeker covered some new technology in some of his videos in his last video that will help with this as far as the chip is concerned and entering serial numbers, so it's a good thing.  Good thing that he covered that information.  I recommend going over and watching his video next.  I'll actually put a link to his video down in my description down here.  So anyways, there you go.  There's the five top reasons why you should never buy slab coins.  Coins that have been graded, obviously.  And there's always going to be controversy over.  I like slab coins and I like raw coins, ungraded coins.  I don't like slabs and back and forth and you can argue the points back and and say, you know, the grading companies are market grading, grading companies are buddy system, and you can think of all kinds of reasons not to put coins in slabs, and you can think of all kinds of reasons to put coins in slabs, but I'm here to tell you this.  PCGS and NGC and all these companies have been in business since the 80s, okay?  And you would think that if there were some type of market grading going on, or if there was some type of switching out of coins going on, or if there was some type of buddy system or anything like that going on, that there would be a whistleblower.  Even the government has whistleblowers.  People whistleblow even on penalty of being threatened, okay?  So that stands to reason, and they're still in business, that these companies handle the most rare coins known.  I mean, they're in their holders, they're in the Smithsonian, they're in top-end collections, and they're coming up on auction all the time.  Nobody's trying to go out of business by being a crooked grading service.  You know, grading consistency is there.  It needs to be fixed.  I get that.  But all this other junk, you know, you can't prove it.  Take them to court, get your attorney, spend the money.  If you think you got a case and just do it.  You know, I obviously think that the grading system needs to be fixed.  We need a standard, needs to catch up with technology.  But the real problem with the grading services or slab coins is not the grading companies themselves.  It's what people do to grading holders.  and the creation of fake grading holders and sellers grading their own coins.  That's where you stay away from slab coins.  Don't stack your slabs.  Don't get slabs.  Don't do all this unless you know you're buying authentic and non-tampered with slab coins.  My name is Daniel.  I'm a coin dealer, and I approve of this message.
