            "text": "The Holocaust brings in much discourse and also much discord.  Despite failing numerous times to produce the actual evidence that 6 million Jews died in horrific circumstances during World War II, as several global researchers have discovered, one life lost is important and I want to make that clear.  It's about the numbers and in comparison to others.  It bothers me when any person loses their life.  But this goes beyond that narrative because it sets the stage for what followed.  But here are some of the figures that dwarf at this point.  alleged six million figure.  that's been profit since world war ii despite the fact that same figure came up 146 times between 1889 and 1946. germany lost seven to nine million of its people.  china lost 20 million with some estimates actually that china lost nearer to 50 million.  Russia lost 24 million people during World War II.  And even the small country known as the Dutch East Indies lost 3 to 4 million people.  Poland lost 5.6 million, some of which were Polish Jews.  The Philippines lost a million people.  And even the small country of Romania lost 833,000 which is only 35,000 less than the total American and British people who died of 450,000 and 418,000 respectively.  25 million people were battle wounded in World War II.  15 million battle deaths and a staggering 45 million civilian deaths.  and yet all we hear about is one group of people's deaths 70 years later who didn't even have a country back then until Britain stole the land of Palestinians and gave it to them.  not to be nice to the Jewish people or some fake biblical prophecy oh no it was to establish a military base for a future hostile takeover of the Middle East lands and resources.  And the sooner the world, including the Jewish people, wake up to that reality, the world will always be on the edge of hostility and we will continue to be railroaded into not questioning the Holocaust or make rules denying the public from criticizing anything related to Israel, which is what took place this week.  There's an old saying, the truth never fears investigation.  That saying has to apply to all me things. ",
