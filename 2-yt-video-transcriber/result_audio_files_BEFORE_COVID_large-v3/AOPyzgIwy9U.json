But what does it actually mean?  How does it relate to politicians, and especially Donald Trump, who it's often invoked in reference to?  Joining us now to break down the concept is David Dunning, social psychologist and professor of psychology at the University of Michigan.  David Dunning, welcome to the show. ",

Scratch that.  They actually can't know they're experts or they can't know the shortcomings or the incompetencies that they may possess.  That's what it is in its short form.  The key in the way in which people tend to get it wrong is they tend to think that this is a phenomenon that basically inflicts other people and it's all about them and how they get it wrong.  But actually the key thing to keep in mind is this is a phenomenon that sooner or later hits all of us.  It's really about us.  and our own incompetencies and our own shortcomings. ",

In terms of politics though, it is most often invoked in my experience and by me in reference to Donald Trump.

And I don't think such a person really exists.  The person who's more expert than everybody else and everything just can't possibly be.

But that's also true for spotting lack of expertise.  That is, to be able to tell when a person has a shortcoming or to tell when a person might be getting something wrong, well, you need the expertise to be able to judge that, the true expertise to judge that.  Now, if you lack that expertise, it means that you lack the very knowledge you need in order to identify shortcomings.  And that's true not only in judgments of other people, but it's also true of the self.  So ultimately what that means is people who lack knowledge lack the knowledge to realize they lack the knowledge. ",

That is, you give people a test or you give people a task to do, ask them how well they think they're doing on it, and then you show them how well they're actually doing on it.  And often what you find is people can very easily recognize all of a sudden at that moment what they don't know.  So, for example... So one common exercise that can be done in the laboratory is if you ask people how a helicopter works or how a ballpoint pen works, they'll go, yeah, sure, I absolutely know how that works.  And then you say, okay, show me in detail how a helicopter works.  And also, by the way, include the detail about how a helicopter moves forward.  And people suddenly realize there are holes in their knowledge that they weren't aware of before.  So there are things that you can do, but one of the things that you can do for yourself is often if \u2013 if a question is important enough, do spend some time thinking about how you might be wrong.  Often you begin to realize cautions or questions that you wouldn't have been otherwise aware of. ",

It seems like One of the things that you gain through experience in a topic is factual knowledge about it.  Particularly in politics, people seem to have a difficulty in differentiating between opinions that they hold strongly and things that are objectively true, which might be another psychological problem with humanity that's sort of inherent to it.  Is that a part of this problem that people have a difficulty in understanding what is and is not actually a fact? ",

And in fact, what we find in our own work is that if you ask Democrats or Republicans factual questions, not only... Opinion questions and factual questions still differ quite widely in terms of what they construe as facts in the ground when it comes to economics, politics, or the social scene in America.  So, for example, during the Obama administration, a majority of Republicans will say the stock market went down.  A majority of Democrats will say it went up.  What happened to the poverty rate the first two years of the Obama administration?  Republicans will say it went up.  Democrats will say it went down.  Now, the truth for one of those questions favors the Democrats.  The truth for the other question favors Republicans.  But Republicans and Democrats tend to come to factual beliefs that only favor themselves. ",

It makes you realize what a walking primate you are, I guess, that we still have these issues.  So I want to ask you another question.  I assume a little bit of this is going to be probably not as grounded in your research, but I am curious about some of the implications.  I wonder, politicians and members of the media \u2013 Consciously or unconsciously, I wonder if people in positions of authority and influence are becoming a little bit more savvy about exploiting some of these psychological issues and gaps to advance their agenda, whether political or a narrative that they're pushing.

I think with the Internet and with the high speed and the high availability of news, it's just much more visible.  That is, we see a lot of other people falling prey to it.  The only question is we don't see ourselves falling prey to it, and that's the next step that we have to achieve somehow. ",

I don't think so.  I couldn't make anything.  A microwave is effectively magic to me.  He brought up helicopters and ballpoint pens.
