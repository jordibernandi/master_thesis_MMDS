            "text": "Twister Christian, today I'm going to discuss some things about what to do after the Dinar Revalues.  All right, now this video, I thought I was going to be able to do it within 20 minutes, but there's many, many things that have to be discussed.  So there's probably going to be a part one, part two, part three, and there's also going to be some other videos that will come off of this, you know, or from this.  So before we get into that, I thank you guys for your support on Patreon and PayPal and I saw some of you guys have signed up over the weekend and that you've also given on PayPal, too, as well.  That is much appreciated, especially since now I have left one of my jobs and I can concentrate more on this.  I did a lot of research and just a lot of talking to different people and things like that.  So if you get a chance, go ahead and sign up with the Patreon or you could do PayPal.  Either way is fine.  That way we can go ahead and continue doing this.  Month to month, we're going to have a lot of a lot of things come out because it's going to be very important that when we go over to this new financial system.  Right.  You don't want to pay attention to what people are saying in the chat rooms and a lot of other stuff because there's going to be a lot of people out there trying to deceive you.  So let's get into the things.  It's 15 main things, but it's kind of.  it's going to be actually more than that.  So it's going to kind of branch off.  Let's just say this.  You wake up.  They've made the announcement on television that the Iraq dinar has changed in value.  Right.  You've just woken up.  You just heard it on the news.  And what do you do next?  Well, the first thing is, is don't panic.  Right.  Some people will panic because they're going to be afraid of what to do next.  You know, I know I'll be.  I'll just be on my knees praising and thanking God for everything.  But one of the things you don't want to do is go into a panic mode.  Right.  It's going to be very important that you need to keep your emotions in check.  A lot of people who have they've made promises, they've said that what they're going to do when they get the money.  But once you have the money in your hands, it's a totally different story.  Right.  Don't get overexcited to as well because you're going to go to the bank.  You don't want to do any kind of overspending because right.  We talked about the other investment opportunities that come from this.  So when it happens, there's going to be a lot of information on the news.  There's going to be a lot of information on the Internet.  And one of the things that you don't want to do is you don't want to post any information on Facebook or social media.  Some of you, you've been sharing for a while.  I've shared about the coming financial system change.  about Iraq changing their value.  And we know that's going to happen because they've said it over and over and over again.  Between Benny and Johnny from Currency365 and myself, we've all showed you articles over the last five years about them changing the value to a higher rate.  All right, now the next thing that you do not want to do, like I said, don't post on social media anything because you don't want people who... did take advantage the opportunity to invest.  now that they know that you have and it's changing value you gonna have people looking for you family friends.  they're gonna be calling you and they're gonna and I in this happens because you have.  you gotta compare this to when people come in the instant wealth or when they win the lottery system.  alright.  now the next thing to do is do not download anything on your computer.  if you're in a chat room in a dinar chat room do not download anything because there are people waiting in those chat rooms and they're going to say here here's a list of 800 numbers right here's a list of banks that you can go to.  do not download anything right.  i would even advise not even to go into the dinar chat rooms because what's going to happen is is that just like any normal exchange if you go to another country now and you need to order currency from your bank you just go in there.  you you know you give your exchange your us dollars and whether they have to order it or whether they have to or they have it on hand then they exchange it for you right there.  you get on your plane and you go and a lot of airports have ex have exchanges already.  i don't think it's going to be some Big major thing.  Banks might have certain procedures when this occurs because the amount of money that's going to be coming in.  So that's going to be very, very important that you just follow the procedures, what your bank is telling you.  Don't sign NDAs when you go into exchange.  Right now, the next thing is, is that you need to change all of your passwords on the day of change all of your passwords online.  to your emails, anything that's linked to your financial information.  You need to change your password.  You need to change your password to get into your computer.  You need to change all of your passwords.  And I say this because the next thing that you're going to do after you've actually done your exchange and you have the money is you're going to buy new computer, new iPad, new phone, For those of you who will be able to afford, I'm sure everybody who's invested is going to be able to do that.  The reason why is because when you set up your new computer system and you log in, you're going to change your password again on your new computer system setup.  It's going to be very important that you change everything because, as you know, there have been a lot of hacks with a lot of different companies, credit companies, and everything else.  So it's going to be very important that you change all your passwords.  That's why I don't recommend you going into any dinar chat rooms, going in there and seeing what people are saying and everything else, because there's going to be a temptation to do those things.  Right.  And whatever you do, do not call an 800 number.  I'm going to keep saying that.  So most definitely you're going to change your passwords when this happens.  All right.  Because when you go on, when you go on the new computer, when you go on your very brand new computer system, right what you.  the next thing that you're going to want to do is is you're going to want to purchase an encrypted email system like I just pulled the article out and says the seven most secure email systems and security measures they practice.  you know.  so one of the things is that you're going to want to do is change over your financial emails anything that's attached to like your banking and and all that you're going to want to switch it over to in a to an encrypted emails Service.  right and I'm not gonna tell you which one to go to because I have.  I need to research a lot of these email services Right just to make sure that hey, these are the ones that we're gonna go with, you know I could recommend two or three when that time comes.  But because you're good because under your new computer system When you after you've already changed your emails, you're gonna log in on your new email system.  I mean you're gonna log in on your new computer and your new iPad and your new phone and And then say, for instance, your bank, your bank is maybe with a Gmail or a hotmail or a different kind of mail, right?  You're going to want to switch that over to an encrypted email service.  And you want to make sure that when, after you do your exchange, that you set up all of your alert systems for every purchase.  That means that means, uh, when you have automatic things coming out of your account, every time you spend.  If you have an additional card for a family member like your wife or husband or son or daughter, you're going to want to make sure that you get every single purchase.  And trust me, it happens.  You know, your your card can be cloned.  And that's one of the things, though, when you do when you do exchange for me, I'm going to get a whole new bank account.  Right.  I'm going to take some and put it in my old bank, my old checking account.  Right.  So I can go out and buy my computer system.  I can go out and get some of the things that I need.  But I'm going to get set up a new checking account and a new savings account automatically.  So it's very important even before you go even into the bank that you one that you change all your passwords to everything.  that is very important.  Right.  Your stock, your your your like if you have Robin Hood or TD Ameritrade, your banks.  You want to change all your email system.  You want to change all your emails to a different encrypted service.  And of course, once it has hit, one of the things you don't want to do is call any 800 number provided in any chat room or anything.  I'm going to keep saying that.  Because there is going to be, when the new financial system takes place, see, it's very easy.  A lot of people in a lot of other countries, including here in the United States, there's a lot of people that are going to try to take advantage.  And don't answer any telephone calls saying, hey, send us your dinars, send us your currency.  Don't do anything like that at all whatsoever.  Because there will be people, because we have given out, especially those who have been invested for a long time, you've done email alerts, you've done text alerts on when the new financial system takes place, that you're going to receive that text or you're going to receive that email.  That means they already have your information.  So say, for instance, some of these chat rooms or sites that are set up for people to come in and discuss what's going on with the new financial system in the IRAC, they have all of your information there.  They have your email.  They have your telephone number.  All right.  So you definitely are not going to be answering any phone calls.  You're not going to be giving away any information when this all takes place.  Now, we haven't got to the main part of what to do as far as at your exchange and after your exchange.  All right.  Because these are things that I think that you're going to need to do beforehand.  I mean, as soon as as soon as the.  dinar revalue takes place because when you wake up in the morning it's gonna be like boom right you're gonna be.  you're gonna be excited.  uh some people are gonna panic right?  some people are gonna call the 800 numbers like idiots but like i said let's just go over those things again right?  so the first thing you do you're not gonna panic you're not gonna.  you're not gonna get overexcited.  you need to stay calm and you stay cool and collected because you're gonna need to think Don't post on Facebook.  Whatever you do, don't post what's happened on Facebook.  Because some of you have thousands of friends, a few hundred friends.  You've told a lot of people about it.  Family, friends, neighbors, whatever the case.  You need to keep it.  What you've done, I'm going to download.  And if I were you, I would probably go back and delete some of those posts that you've made in the past.  Because some people are going to remember.  Then the next thing you're going to do is not call any 800 numbers.  I wouldn't recommend going into any chat rooms.  I wouldn't download anything that anybody puts up.  Here's the 800 numbers.  Here's the list of the 800 numbers.  Boom, you just downloaded something.  See, now you just downloaded something to your computer system.  You don't know if that has viruses attached to that.  And whatever you do, whatever email alerts that you get in your email.  Right.  That's why we're going to be switching everything over.  Do not even open it.  I'm just telling you.  Do not even open it, because once you you know, you open up the email and, you know, like I said, these people have your email address.  So when this takes place.  You're going to be getting a lot of emails because your emails, your emails been out there.  You've joined different chat rooms.  You don't.  you've joined different groups.  Do not even open up any emails that say, you know, from dinar or whatever.  Don't do it because you're trying to protect your investment and there are going to be people out there trying to get it right.  Then before you even go to the bank, you're going to change all your passwords.  You're going to write them down.  Even if you use the same password for all of your changes, I'm just saying this because when you change over to the new system, when you change your email address to all your financial information, you're going to change your passwords again.  After you're on your new computer system, your new iPad system, on your new everything, you're going to change it again.  So we've gone over the first part of this.  Like I said, guys, this is when I started writing all this stuff down.  And there's just a lot of security things that you're going to have to do.  And those are the security things that you're going to do before.  Right.  And so another thing is and hopefully you've already done this.  You need to make sure which banks will do the exchange.  Now, when it does happen, you need to call the bank.  You need to call your.  you need to call your local bank.  That you're banking with.  If you don't bank with a bank.  That doesn't do foreign currency.  You need to contact your bank first.  And find out which banks do.  Right.  Because some people live in big towns.  Some people live in small towns.  Some of you are going to have to travel.  Right.  And we're going to get into all that in the next.  And all these videos that are coming this week.  We're going to get into that.  Because it's going to be very important that you protect what you have.  Don't be surprised if there are going to be people at the banks.  you know, trying to do whatever they can.  They know people are going to be going in and exchanging.  So you got to be very careful.  So these are some, these are just some of the things that you're going to have to do before you go into your bank.  All right.  So we look, do not call 800 numbers.  Don't go to the chat rooms.  Don't download anything in your email or in chat rooms, right?  You're going to change your, are you going to change all of your passwords?  Every single one of them, Right now, you some of you have a lot of, you know, different websites and stuff like that that you might go to.  that have nothing to do with financial whatever.  But you're going to.  you're going to change all that your Facebook password, any social media.  You want to change all your passwords on the same day that it happens.  All right.  So so that way you can prepare yourself that after you go to the bank to exchange.  That you're going to buy, you know, your your desktop, your laptop, your iPad, your phone.  Because I'm going to recommend that everybody does get a new phone with a new telephone number.  All right.  So those are going to be some of the.  that's going to be the next thing that I discuss in tomorrow's video about.  I'm just going to keep going down the list about what to do after your purchase or during.  Well, first of all, during your purchase or when you're on your way to the bank.  And then what you're going to do after you've got all you've exchanged all your dinars and there is sitting in the bank.  And then we'll go from there because I don't think that you guys should use your same checking account and your same savings account.  There's going to be some other things that you're going to need to do by putting money, maybe putting some aside in a CD.  Just just in case in an untouchable account that you can't touch for a year, just in case you decide to overspend.  That way you still have something left over.  Alright, so tomorrow we're going to go over what to do when you're at the bank, right, and what to do after you've left the bank.  And then the next couple videos we're going to be doing is we're going to be doing some other security things too as well.  Because once you decide what you're going to do, you know, if you're going to move, how you're going to settle your family and friends, your church, how to give.  There's going to be all those different things that you're going to need to consider because things change.  Once you get the money in your hands, things change, right?  We've made a lot of promises, and that's another thing.  Stop making promises to anybody what you're going to do when this thing takes off.  So with that, we're at the end of part one, and tomorrow we're going to do part two.  All right, thank you guys for listening.  Check out part two tomorrow.  Twisted Christian out. ",
