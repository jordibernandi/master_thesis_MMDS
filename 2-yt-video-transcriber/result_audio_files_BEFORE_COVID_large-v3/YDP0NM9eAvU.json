One thing that always bugs me about these conversations, however, is the way in which the butchering of the civilian Midianite captives and the rape of the virgin girls is always left out.  Like, they never include that.  I wonder if that's because it's too hard to bullshit away with the pretense that this is all about warfare rather than genocide.  But I guess we'll find out.

Fact is, no historian has ever supplied evidence that said people were in Egypt at that time, or that any of the subsequent claims have merit.

First, we must understand that there is a standard of justice.  Otherwise, everything is simply relative to a certain place, time, and event.  The Bible declares that God is a merciful, loving, and perfectly just God.  He would never commit an unjust or brutal act.  It's against his very nature as a God of love.  However, God's holiness and his justice does require that those who do perpetrate evil will be punished.  So when God does enact judgment, it's for a good reason. ",

Mr.  Jim\u00e9nez, what you've brought forward as evidence that the God of the Bible as written is not a monster is the very assertion you are in want of evidence to defend.  I mean, could you imagine trying this in court, attempting to define, not show, but define the defendant as a law-abiding citizen and thus conclude that the evidence to the contrary may be ignored?  That wouldn't stand up in court, so why would it work for God?  I expect better, quite literally, from an all-knowing, all-powerful being. ",

            "text": "The second step of interpretation is to understand just how evil and corrupt these tribes or these enemies of Israel were in the ancient Near East.  The Canaanites, for example, were incestuous people.  Many believed that their god Baal wanted them to rape people as a form of worship.  They also sacrificed the children to Moloch and fire.  And when you take a closer look into the culture of the Amalekites, What you find is a group of murderous people who refused for 400 years.  Think about that, 400 years.  They chose not to repent and they continued down the path feeding off of their grotesque sins.  Many of these cultures that God permitted to be destroyed were so completely corrupt that there was no hope for the next generation. ",

            "text": "So let's just get this straight.  Your God's solution for a society in which you assert without basis, I must add, performed ritualised rape and child sacrifice was to butcher every male child and rape every virgin girl with God's blessing.  Because that's what happened to the aforementioned Midianites.  The civilians, mostly women, infant boys and virgin girls, were successfully captured during the battle.  To stress, these people were non-combatant civilians taken as the spoils of war.  So what does Moses do?  He orders every non-Virgin girl along with every infant boy to be slaughtered in captivity, to be butchered, before he then goes on to tell his men that they may take and rape the Virgin girls as a reward for their services to the God you are defending.  And this rape at captives is such a large part of Hebrew and Israelite society that Deuteronomy lays down the law about how one may go about raping said captive Virgin girls.  Remember, said virgin girls are the only ones typically spared.  Why?  Well, it's all part of genocide for the Hebrews.  You see, the Hebrews believed that only the father side was inherited.  Therefore, to kill a people, you only needed to kill all the men and the women who were not virgins in case they'd just conceived before they were captured.  Can you say hypocrite?  Also, the claim that nobody could be spared sort of fucks over your God in another way, since any argument that God couldn't have resolved the issue without violating their free will that sort of goes out the window.  If these people couldn't be saved, period, where's the free will in that?  Well done in shooting yourself in the foot there. ",

And it has to do with the level of hyperbole that is occasionally used in some Old Testament passages of warfare.  Phrases like, utterly destroyer, wipe out everyone, or the land was completely destroyed.  These are not to be taken literally.  It's like a form of speech, like a figure of graphic speech that carries on a level of exaggeration to describe military conquest.  Just like, you know, when you think of a team that says they slaughtered their opponent or they smoked them or we destroyed or we annihilated them.  We know that they're not to be taken literally. ",

Also, what does the claim that this style of exaggeration was used suggest?  For one, it tells us that clearly, God cannot be all-powerful.  for you see, an all-powerful God would not require exaggeration.  Why have stars appear like twinkling diamonds when you could have twinkling diamonds with all the same attributes of stars?  And the fact that the Hebrews could verbally one-up God, that shows a limit to God's power.  It also tells us what said God thinks is an impressive boast of their power, something that is equally fucked up when we acknowledge the fact that we're talking about an apparently perfect entity. ",

Yet, of course, you don't hear a lot of people, especially the new atheist people, complaining about that.  I mean, if you think about it, what kind of God would he be if he abandoned his promises to Israel and he allowed these wicked people to kill them off?  My friends, what we actually see in the pages of scripture is a God using his people Israel as a model of his great love and showing great mercy to the nations who were flaunting their incestuous and sick, twisted, murderous behavior.  And yet after periods of time, this ample time to repent, they chose to refuse and reject God.  And tragically, that's when God's righteous judgment did fall upon them. ",

Even the Bible acknowledges the fact that Moses and the Hebrews were the invading force according to the story it tells.  They're the ones who were invaded on their path from Egypt, partaking in what can only be described as ethnic cleansing of indigenous populations settled in that region.  It was the promised land, not the land we currently have.  The fact that said people use God or His promise as a justification for their genocide doesn't suddenly stop said act from being atrocious.  That's a basic principle you don't seem capable of comprehending.  Simply asserting God or God's promise doesn't magic away the problem being discussed.  quite the opposite.  God could have made it so that nobody settled in that region whilst the Hebrews were away.  They could have done so either directly or indirectly.  In popular media involving magic, there are often spells which make people walk in the opposite direction.  God could have enacted such barriers, or failing to do that, why not dry up every water source in that area?  People require water to live.  No water, no people.  Nobody would settle in such a place, and God could have dried things up slow enough that anyone there prior to that point moved out of said land out of necessity in search of new pastures.  Then when Moses and the Hebrews arrive there, bring back the rains.  I mean, it worked for Paul Atreides in that campus-fucked Dune movie, so why not Moses?  Are the imaginative powers of David Lynch so much more powerful than Those Are Your God?  I'm sorry, but that's a simple fucking solution that would allow God to avoid the genocide and conquest rape.  Another one which is based on one of God's powers in the official canon?  would be closing the womb of every woman in that region a good three to four generations prior to Exodus.  We know God can do so since we see this in Genesis chapter 30 with Jacob and the drooling vaginas.  So yeah, your video amounts to a big place of nothing.  But what do you guys think?  Is there any context, real or hypothetical, in which genocide or rape can be considered just?  What do you think about my proposed solutions to avoid bloodshed, reasonable or unreasonable?
