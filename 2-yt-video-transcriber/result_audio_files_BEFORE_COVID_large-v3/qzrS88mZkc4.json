            "text": "Turns out it's worth $50 million.  That was opposition leader Andrew Scheer in the House questioning why, yet again, the Liberal government is handing out your hard-earned tax dollars to corporate welfare.  First, it was loblaws for some refrigerators.  Priceless.  And it was Canadian tire for a few million dollars for their electric cars.  Priceless.  And then it was Blackberry, who didn't even ask for the money, still got $40 million.  Crisis.  So they got it.  They didn't even need it.  Didn't ask for it.  Well, here, let's add another one to the list.  MasterCard, a multi-billion dollar credit card company.  The Trudeau government handed out $50 million of your money to them.  And here was what the prime minister had to say in response to that.  Everything this government does is focused on growing the middle class and helping people working hard to join it, like the tax cut we're moving forward with.  that is putting more money in the pockets of 20 million Canadians and lifting close to a million people off of the federal tax roll.  These are the kinds of things that make a difference in people's lives.  Yet another one of Justin Trudeau's original responses.  Nothing but baffle gag and who knows what the heck that even meant.  Here's the bottom line.  Corporate welfare, it doesn't work.  Time after time after time.  When the government gets itself involved in the market, usually those companies end up failing.  Except in this instance.  MasterCard, who is supposedly opening up a shop in Vancouver, why on earth they would need $50 million of our hard-earned money is still a giant question mark, especially when Canadians are struggling to meet their rents, struggling to pay their bills, and frankly, struggling to pay off the very credit cards that we just gave $50 million to.  And again, the Leader of the Opposition made some excellent points when it came to questioning the government about their priorities. ",
