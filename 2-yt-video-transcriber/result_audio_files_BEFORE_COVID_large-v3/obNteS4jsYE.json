            "text": "Hello ladies and gentlemen.  Today is the 10th of December 2019.  I'm Roy Potter.  Welcome.  I find it necessary to put this up now because if you'll recall, this is not a live stream.  I'm recording this so I can make sure that I get it up and that there are no interruptions in the transmission while you watch it.  So you'll have to pardon me for that.  I'll just say hold off.  Okay, so what have I got going here?  Well, The fact of the matter is that I said if Trump does not have people arrested this week, that in effect this is over with, that this entire thing is being done to placate us and to keep us from seeing results and to hold off until whatever else they're putting together for our demise occurs.  Well, so reviewing a... the interview that Barr had with NBC News.  I want to play you something, okay?  So here we go.  Just listen to this.  It's about a minute and a half, and I want you to pay attention to what he says about how long it's going to be before Durham has something occur.  Here we go. ",

We have to be careful about the way we collect evidence and we have to make sure that we have enough evidence to justify our actions, and we're not going to cut corners in that respect.  There are some people who think this thing is going to drop in a few weeks.  That's not the case.  I see this perhaps reaching an important watershed perhaps in the late spring, early summer. ",

Ladies and gentlemen, we're being played.  We're being played by everyone.  I told you that if there weren't any arrests this week, am I rushing things?  Look, I've been involved in investigations before.  If the government wants somebody, they come and they get them.  You're telling me that Durham and any actions from the Justice Department against these coup plotters at all Nothing will be seen before spring or summer.  Ladies and gentlemen, could this be that they're just trying to convince those who they're investigating that they're not going to come after them right away to put them off guard?  What are you people all thinking?  Oh, this is just another trick?  Then there are those who are going to say, Roy, these things take time.  I'm going to tell you something, okay?  I just said it.  These investigations have been done by judicial watch.  The evidence is all there.  No, there is no excuse for Barr and Durham to wait till spring or summer.  And if Trump lets them get away with it, I'm sorry, but he has done us a great disservice.  Go back and look at that.  I told you again, I said, if there are no arrests this week, nothing is coming down the pike that is going to save what's left of this wretched, disgusting, debased, corrupt, criminal government.  Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.  I don't even know if I'm going to come back on ever.  if you can't see the writing on the wall now what good is it for me to be up here talking about it?  okay that's all i have for you.  this is a disaster beyond the pale.  I might see again.  I might not.  You know how I am.  I'll probably recant because I'll get Nancy Morgan Hart and G.G.  Sims on me saying, Roy, you can't give up.  You've got to keep with it.  But when we have a president and an attorney general that is playing this game This is the most disgusting, despicable thing I've seen since Hillary Clinton, and it might be worse.  Okay, until next time, I'm just going to play this out, okay?  Until next time. ",
