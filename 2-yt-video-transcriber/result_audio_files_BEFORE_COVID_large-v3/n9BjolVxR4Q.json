My dad wasn't a consistent presence in my life growing up, and that was difficult because I had to learn how to be a man by observing other men in my life, some of whom weren't always the best role models.  And then I became a dad myself, and I wanted to become a good example of what I thought a good dad should be.  And now I'm much more vulnerable and engaged in my daughter's life.  But I'm definitely not alone in this.  I know a lot of men that are changing the narrative and exploring different ideas of what it truly means to be a dad.  I'm Jason Rosario, and this is Dear Men.

Kids are good, good kids.  I taught them the good and the bad of life.  I have one son who is young and is grappling with his own gender identity, which has been rather challenging and enlightening as well.  It enlightened me of my own sense of who I am and, you know, it's, you know, we've had some interesting moments, definitely.  I have a 10-year-old son.

And so now, like looking at these two little boys, Not to say that it wasn't really tough to go through that five years, but I couldn't imagine being anyone else but them.  They're just the light of our world, the light of our life.  I didn't know I had another chamber of love in my heart, you know, because for me, my love all went to Scott and then the passions and what I love and my career and my life and my friends and my family.  But they unlocked this ridiculous type of love.  that's undescribable.  And that's the joy.  The most important thing I can say for whether you're a single parent out there or you are raising your child with someone else is if you're a single parent, the more you stay connected to yourself and the happier you are, that's where the child is going to get their happiness from.
