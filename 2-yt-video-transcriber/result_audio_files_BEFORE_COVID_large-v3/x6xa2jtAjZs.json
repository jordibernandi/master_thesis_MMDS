            "text": "The illegal immigrant who murdered Kate Steinle has the charge of being a felon in possession of a gun.  The last remaining conviction against him overturned.  The state of California claims to crack down on guns except when they are in the hands of illegal immigrants who murder Americans.  Un-freakin'-believable.  It's time for First Thoughts.  Jose Ennis Garcia Zarate, the illegal immigrant deported five times and facing deportation at the time he murdered 32-year-old Kate Steinle, had his last remaining conviction overturned by a California appeals court last week.  The Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District ruled Jose Zarate didn't get a fair trial when he, a felon, was convicted of possessing a gun.  Of all the illegal immigrant coddling nonsense that comes out of this messed up state, that right there is the biggest load of BS I have ever heard.  You know who didn't get a fair trial?  Kate Steinle.  Kate Steinle will be permanently separated from her family all because an illegal immigrant with several deportations and no right to be here was in San Francisco on July 1st, 2015.  Zarate was acquitted of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, and assault with a semi-automatic firearm.  The only conviction he faced was being a felon in possession of a firearm, and now that has been overturned.  Where is the justice for Kate Steinle, for her family, for the American people and legal immigrants who obey the laws and do our best to live in a state that prioritizes helping, shielding, and rewarding felons?  illegal immigrants, and illegal immigrant felons over protecting and serving Americans and legal residents.  This is an absolute abomination and a slap in the face to us all.  And I don't care how liberal you are, even Democrats have to look at this miscarriage of justice and feel ashamed.  Our Democratic leadership needs to answer for this.  The illegal immigrant who murdered Kate Steinle might be off scot-free, but our Democratic leaders and sanctuary state advocates have blood on their hands.  What an embarrassment to California. ",
