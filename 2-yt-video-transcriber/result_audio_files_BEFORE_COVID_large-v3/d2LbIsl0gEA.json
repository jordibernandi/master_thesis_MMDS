Fine, I'll just mock you relentlessly for the next 10-20 minutes, but first I'm going to tell you about the experiment I'm doing.  So then you've got no excuse not to debate me.  On July 27th, me and Scientific American contributing editor George Musser will be doing a worldwide collaborative science experiment as people all over the earth repeat Eratosthenes' experiment at solar noon and measure the angle of a shadow cast by the sun with a stick.  I'll be live streaming the entire day to collect data in real time and programming the data points onto a globe model and a flat model.  Then I'll be able to determine if the Sun is small and local or far away.  If the Earth is flat then this experiment will show it.  So I invite everyone including flat earthers to get involved and add their data points to the experiment.  I need as many people as possible doing the experiment, recording, live streaming, posting to twitter facebook instagram and anything else.  if you want to get involved in any way then email me at fight the flat earth at gmail.com and i'll get back to everyone within the next week and organize groups etc.  but for now let's listen to danny boy say some stupid stuff.  then i can tell you why he's wrong and how much of a dumbass he is.  well guys you know the drill by now.

He was shown a mountain of evidence both times and still thinks we live on a magic frisbee created by some beardy bloke in the sky.  it's pointless.  Fine alright.  So, what is weight?  Well, weight is mass times the gravitational acceleration.  What?  No, no, I don't mean the swirling vortex energy ether, whatever the fuck that is.  Just shut up and at least pretend you're paying attention, Mr.  Pratt.  The gravitational acceleration on Earth is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared.  This is referred to as 1g, meaning your weight on Earth is your mass times 1g.  On the moon, the gravity is approximately 0.16g, or 16% of Earth's gravity.  So that means on the moon, you would weigh your mass times 0.16g.  which is 1.6 meters per second squared.  What, Mr.  Pratt?  Well, maybe if you took off that stupid hat, you could hear me.

Because the air has a gradient even over the length of this balloon.  that means that there is more of a force from the air pressure acting on the bottom of the balloon than at the top.  And as the balloon is lighter than air that pushes it up.  But this whole process is dependent on gravity pulling down the air.  The same thing applies to everything that's lighter than air.
