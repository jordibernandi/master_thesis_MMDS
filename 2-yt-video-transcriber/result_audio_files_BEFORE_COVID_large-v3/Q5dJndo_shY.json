And this is the claim that the Bible makes repeatedly, that time is a beginning and that God was the one that created both space and time.  And if God is not subject to linear time, then he need not have a beginning or an ending.  Now, I think the way you can understand that, the Bible also claims in Psalm 90 that God can arbitrarily compress time and expand time.  A day of the Lord is like a thousand years.  A thousand years is like a day.  A thousand years is like three hours in the night.  And that's mathematically only possible for a being or an entity who can operate in at least the equivalent of two dimensions of time.  So one of the things I've done in Beyond the Cosmos is give you diagrams showing, have you got access to two dimensions of time?  You can arbitrarily compress or expand time along a single dimension of time. ",

Mathematically, that minimally applies, that God's got access to the equivalent of two dimensions of time.  And we now have the physics that proves that time actually does have a beginning that is created.  And so it explained to both my sons when they asked that question when they were three and a half, and to Lewis Walpark, who was the chairman of the biology department at one time in Imperial College, if you got two dimensions of time, you could have God operating on a timeline over here, infinitely long, that never crosses or touches the timeline of our universe over here.  As such, he would have no beginning, no ending, and it would be uncreated.  Now, of all the world's holy books, the Bible is the only one that says of God, no beginning, no ending, uncreated, the master of time, the author, and the creator of time. ",

They accept the Old and New Testament and they add additional material.  And the part that they take, the Old and New Testament, is consistent with this idea that God is no beginning, no ending, and that he is the author and master of time.  But if you look at the non-biblical religions, it's God or gods working within time.  The gods are subject to time rather than over time and the creator of time.
