            "text": "Think about the average guy's experience throughout a relationship.  From the very get-go, most men say yes to everything she asks for.  We actually feel good about doing anything she asks for because it puts a spring in our step to do something kind for someone else, to put a smile on their face.  Where it's not for us, it's for the other person.  And as a result, we feel good about doing some sort of kindness, even if we're not directly the beneficiary of that kindness.  The result of doing the act gives us fulfillment and happiness.  Ask her out, go to dinner, pay for dinner, trips, romantic movies, picnics with stupid blankets on the grass.  Anything she asks for, anything that might seem childish to us or a little bit like we're playing in a dollhouse with a little girl, we'll do it because it makes her happy.  For the most part, guys really don't care too much what is asked of them as long as it's not too ridiculous.  It doesn't matter how mature or immature it is or it seems to a guy.  So a man generally says yes to every need.  a woman asks of him.  So she seems to have all the needs in a relationship and a man generally doesn't.  He just fulfills her needs.  But here's the important thing, gentlemen.  Try having needs of your own and see what she says and how she reacts.  It's something I don't hear and I haven't heard anyone talk about.  I don't know if it's because generally men are ashamed for being needy.  You'll hear women say, I don't like needy men.  But to me, it's always seemed like a covert tactic.  Why can you have every need in the relationship and it's relentless?  And if I don't say yes to every one of your frivolous needs, then somehow it's not a healthy relationship.  But the moment I ask for something, the moment I have needs, it's somehow seen as feminine.  Now, I know men are self-sufficient, so they don't like asking for help.  But this covert tactic in regards to modern relationships, especially where you can't ask anything of a woman because it's seen as needy at best or dominating and patriarchal and offensive at worst, I think it's a really sleazy tactic.  guys need to see.  Try having your own needs.  Ask her to do something for you and see how she reacts.  See if she pauses and starts making up excuses like, I'm tired or I don't feel like, I don't really feel like doing that.  Why should I?  The why's come out.  Whenever you heard a man ask why, he has to go to a picnic or a romantic movie.  He does it because he knows she likes it.  It'll make her happy.  He wants to do something nice for the person he cares about.  But notice the resistance you get when you ask a woman for something, when you have needs.  I'm not talking about being wimpy.  acting like a little boy or a child.  I'm just saying, simply as another human being, a man, saying, I'd like you to do this, or this would really make me happy.  Can you go and pick this up for me?  Go out of your way.  Not on her way to see you or to get something for you that's on her way.  Actually, ask her to go out of her way to do something for you where she does not benefit.  This touches on one of my previous videos where it relates to Brie Folt's law where if she doesn't benefit, she's not interested.  And I think this speaks to this topic I'm speaking about.  She's not interested in benefiting you if she doesn't benefit first.  It's not the same with men.  We can enjoy doing the task in and of itself.  making someone feel good, of being kind.  See if she can reciprocate that.  See how quote-unquote loving she is.  See how quote-unquote caring and understanding and loving the opposite sex really is, especially when it's got to do with ostensibly the most important, deepest relationship she should have in her life, you.  Try having needs, gentlemen, where it has nothing to do with her.  It's happened in my life in the past.  And it was so stark and it made me think, why when you ask a woman to do something simply for you, she resists with, oh, that's not something I'm comfortable with.  That's not me.  And it's not anything that's against her values or ethics.  She just refuses to do it because it doesn't benefit her.  It's only going to benefit you.  She doesn't care about feeling good where she does kindness to somebody she knows.  A lot of women will be kind to things that don't really matter.  And a lot of times I think it's an ego trip.  You know, a lot of them will want to save the whales.  They go overboard with the environment.  They'll sponsor children from another country.  They'll always worry about some other place on the other side of the planet.  But take a look at how they treat their father, their spouse.  It's very different.  The most important thing is how you treat the people, the tactile people in your life that are part of your real world.  virtue signaling about loving the entire world is bs.  see if they can be kind to somebody in their own life their immediate life that they can affect directly like you.  see how they treat their fathers their family members how they treat their boyfriends.  if they're kind when people virtue signal about being kind to absolute strangers and ideals that are on the other side of the planet i would be suspicious.  see how kind she can be where she doesn't benefit other than showing kindness for somebody else because it's the right thing to do and she wants to enact a kind gesture and the reward of doing it seemingly selflessly is the reward in and of itself.  I noticed this in my past where you'd go to a gathering or a group of friends and the girlfriend I'm with, I tell her, look, Joe at the gathering, I just need to tell you, he's sensitive about a certain issue.  Don't talk about it.  And then she'll be resistant and say, well, I'll talk about whatever I want.  That's not me.  Why should I?  Or when we go to this person's house, their custom is that you need to bow to them.  That's the way it is.  I don't bow.  That's not me.  I'm not being authentic.  That's not the way I was raised.  And my response was, I don't care what you want to do in your private life.  That's fine.  In another person's home, in another person's set of rules, when I'm telling you that it's for me, I care about this.  I care about my friends.  And you are part of my life.  And you need to abide by that.  And you don't care.  It's saying you don't care about me.  I don't care what you want.  Do it for me.  I don't want to raise my voice.  But if you refuse to just be kind towards somebody else where you have no benefit other than being humble and being kind, then that to me says a lot.  So yes, gentlemen.  We're very used to being kind right off the bat when we start going out with women, when we're in the romantic phase especially.  Some women will cover this up to a larger degree if they like you a lot.  They'll say all the right things to sort of keep the relationship going.  But when that honeymoon period fades and the real person comes out, do not overlook or be ashamed to call out the behavior of not wanting to be kind to you when you quite fairly are just asking them to do something.  Have some needs, gentlemen.  And I know guys on autopilot don't because it's seen as shameful because guys are generally self-sufficient.  They don't like to ask for help.  They like to figure things out for themselves.  There's an actual intellectual reflex and interest to do that automatically.  It's not really something we hold back because we're scared.  But especially today, when women do precious little and expect 10 times more than our ancestors, I would suggest consciously asking her to reciprocate in giving.  Have some needs, ask her to do things for you.  that you could probably do for yourself, but to see how she responds.  See how naturally kind she is and automatically happy she is to get up and do whatever you've asked.  And similarly you.  But I guess most guys automatically do almost anything a woman wants of them, especially if we like them.  But even the women that like us seem to resist doing anything where they don't benefit.  have some needs, ask them to do something where they don't benefit and see the result and reveal if there's actual love there, if there's a decent personality, if there's someone with empathy and sympathy.  I think it's really important to think about and more men should tattoo that into their brain.  Because with friends and all of our other familial and personal important relationships, that is there.  A very easy and comfortable reciprocity.  That reciprocity with women is not there.  It's Machiavellian at best and it's blind with men at worst.  Do yourself a favor.  Have some needs.  Don't be a wimp.  Have some needs and see if she'll be kind to you.  Because at the end of the day, that's what the relationship should be.  Supportive, kind.  It goes for any intimate relationship.  Anyway, something to think about.  Have some needs, gentlemen.  Test it out.  Most men go around believing that their women love them, especially for the scientifically inclined guys.  Test it out.  Ask her for something.  See how much Pumpkin really loves you.  See how much she really cares.  See how fragile she really is.  Most of you will be surprised.  Anyway, something to think about.  I'll talk to you later.
