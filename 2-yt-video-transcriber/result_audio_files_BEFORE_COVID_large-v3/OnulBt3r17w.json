            "text": "You have never looked in the mirror and actually seen yourself.  And that's why you don't have no love for you because you don't know nothing that a black man ever did that's worthy of respect or honor.  Much less to dare to say that a black man is God.  That blows your mind totally out because every black man you've ever seen has been nothing.  And even if he does something, your mind has been trained to suspect what he does.  So even when he does something of value, you say that nigga ain't doing nothing.  You've heard it said if a black man is selling oil and a white man is selling oil, we always think that the white man's oil heats better.  If a black man is selling ice and a white man is selling ice, the white man's ice is colder.  I mean, we actually think that black folk cannot do anything.  well.  Alright, that's a stage of death.  Now, here comes Master Farad Muhammad.  Now, the honorable Elijah Muhammad said that Master Farad Muhammad's father was Allah before him.  What does Allah mean?  The Quran opens up saying, I, Allah, am the best knower.  Well, the one who is the best knower is Allah.  See?  Now, look.  There's no force, there's no force that you know.  that says it is the best knower, though knowledge is the supreme force.  Is that right?  But knowledge has to be contained in something.  Spirits don't walk around talking and conveying knowledge.  It's a mind that contains knowledge and man is the supreme life in the universe.  And he's formed right after God himself.  This is why the Quran says, Islam is not your religion, it is your nature.  It is the nature of God and the nature in which God created man.  He gives you his same nature.  Well, if you've got his same nature, then you and him is the same.  So you're not a child of God, you are God, a descendant of the Creator himself.  Now let's look at this.  All right.  Now it's time to get you.  The time has come.  All these prophets have been talking about God will come.  There ain't no prophet that said God is present.  They said God will come.  Moses kept saying, and when he come.  Noah said, and when he come.  Lot said, and when he comes, and even Jesus said, and when he comes, the spirit of truth, he will guide you into all truth.  Jesus wasn't talking about himself.  He was talking about somebody that he recognizes greater than himself.  David, the great prophet of Israel.  Looking down in the wheel of time saw the master prophet.  This is why when you call the honorable Elijah Muhammad a messenger, that's the cheapest title you could give him Because he's not just a messenger.  He's the master of all prophets.  He masters what they taught.  They were in darkness.  They reveal words of light, but they themselves didn't understand the depth of what God had given them.  But the one who comes in the last day don't come as a prophet.  He comes with God.  Excuse me.  Everything white started running, you know, when truth comes.  All right.  Now, we're going to finish this quickly.  Master Farad Muhammad, he's not on the scene.  But it is written that God would come after the sheep that was lost.  God would come after you.  Now, he wouldn't send no prophet.  He would come himself.  The book says, in that day when God comes.  This is the Bible.  Every eye shall see him.  Every tongue shall be made to confess how you gonna see something what you can't see What do you mean?  and on in that day when you see him you will be like him and he will be like you.  What are you talking about?  That's in the Bible.  See as long as you don't see God as Yourself You won't call out of yourself your capabilities.  But as long as you think that the master of the universe is some spirit out there, you will never see yourself with the capabilities and possibilities of mastering the very forces of the heavens and the earth.  But you are the natural master of the forces of the universe.  But you're going to have to grow into that now.  All right.  Now here comes... God talking, it's time to go after the sheep that is lost.  Where are they lost?  They're lost in the West, among wolves.  Who lives in the West?  The Caucasian.  Well, anything that's jet black, if he come into that house, they'll spot him immediately.  So the old Christians said, prepare me a body that I may go down.  Brother, this is beautiful wisdom if you understand it.  Here's a man coming that's going to judge two people.  The white man and the black man.  He's got to judge them so he's got to have the nature of both in order to deal with both.  So in order to produce one that can get among the devils, Brother this is something powerful.  Now I'm just going to give you the example.  in order to produce one that can get among the devil He's got to find the right earth to plant his seed in.  Look there's all kind of products that a farmer can produce.  You just got to know the nature quality of the earth and and the nature and quality of your seed and what you want to produce, then you find the right earth for your seed.  One thing that we have never been taught, as the Honorable Elijah Muhammad mentions it in the book on knowledge of self, the white man never wanted to teach black people the science of mating.  We just lay down and have children and luck up on geniuses because we're so great.  Wise men study themselves, know themselves.  They say, well, I know the multiplier.  Now let me study what product I want.  And if I want to produce this product, then if I am the multiplier and I know what I am, then what is the multiplicand?  Where will I find what I'm looking for to make my product?  For instance, If I know that I am a 4, and I want to produce an 8, then I've got to find a 2 to multiply with to produce the 8.  This is called the product.  This is called the multiplier.  This is called the multiplication.  Is that right?  All right.  Well, it's the same way that mathematics is in life.  If I know what I possess, my characteristics, my qualities, but I know what I need, then I set my sight to look for the woman that has what I'm looking for so that when I multiply with her, I'll get the product that I'm after.  The wise father of Master Farad Muhammad was after a product that could get in among the devil.  And the scriptures say this of him.  They said he came in sinful flesh.  to condemn sin in the flesh.  Oh, this is heavy stuff.  Now look, Master Farad Muhammad, yes, a man, born February 26, 1877.  He's not the originator of the heavens and the earth.  No, he wasn't here then.  But he's from that same line.  But his knowledge... It's so great that it supersedes the wisdom even of his father.  Now listen to this.  He was so wise, so says the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, the man pictured and extracted the language of the people on Mars.  He spoke the language of the birds.  Talked to the wild beasts, man.  He knew the language of the human families.  I mean, he listened to you.  think.  Know your thoughts.  That ain't no heavy thing when you understand that's minor stuff.  But the heaviest thing is to control the universe and master its laws and make the universe bow to his will.  That's the kind of power that he has.  Now he comes to North America, as the scriptures say, he came alone.  And the books say he would measure the earth.  Measure it.  and tell its measurement.  And when he came, he shocked to us of a rise of questions.  What is the square mileage of the earth?  How much is the land?  How much is the water?  He's running it.  And he gives the answer.  196,940,000 square miles.  That's the square miles of the earth.  The water is 139,685,000 square miles and the land is 57,255,000 square miles.  He started running the circumference, the diameter, and the distance between the planets.  He's telling the honorable Elijah Muhammad, look man, I'm the master of this.  And I'm going to make you the master of this.  So I'm going to give you a flag that shows a master.  I don't want you to have no little jive stars and stripes.  I don't want you to have no little jive rag around you.  I'm giving you a flag that shows a master.  I'm giving you the sun, the moon, and the star.  And the only man that's qualified to wear that flag is a master.  And you got to master the law that governs the universe in order to be qualified to wear the flag of the universe.  But I'm going to give you that because I'm a master and I'm going to make you a master.  But before I make you a master, I got to make one man among you a master.  Because I'm half original now.  I got a white looking face though my father's a jet black man.  But I'm coming to put a black head on a black body because I'm not to be the head of that body.  I am to be the head of the head of that body but I'm not to be the head of that body.  Therefore I search among the lost found to find me one man worthy.  And he found a little Georgia born black man that only went to the third grade of school and he taught him three and one half years and went away.  Now to prove that he's God, he leaves a man that ain't went to school.  And the man confounds the scholars with what his teacher taught him.  Look here now.  To prove, look here.  See?  To prove that he's God, he tells little Georgia-born Elijah what was on Mars and what is on the moon and the nature of the moon and how the moon got to be the moon.  And the Honorable Elijah Muhammad revealed it.  and why did he go up and bear witness?  Elijah Wright.  He is a little Georgia-born man telling you what was coming down the pike.  We couldn't even see the pike, much less what was coming.  And every word that Elijah spoke is right on it.  Who taught him?  but a master?  See?  Now those who say that Master Farad Muhammad is not God, then who are you worshipping?  You say, I worship the true God, Allah.  Well then what has your God taught you?  that is superior to what that man taught Elijah?  How come your scholars can't handle the followers of Elijah?  How come the world couldn't deal with that man Elijah?  How come the white man, who is a vicious beast, brother, God raised up a little lamb in the midst of a beast and the beast couldn't eat Elijah?  Who was the God shutting that man's mouth and opening the mouth of Elijah?  We don't carry no guns.  We were taught by Master Farad Muhammad through the messenger, don't even care so much as a penknife.  And they have attacked us and we've taken their weapons and killed them with their own weapons.  What God has been with us.  And to prove that God is still with us, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad has left, but he left his word with us.  Now we take the same word and go right back to what the white man tore down with hypocrites among us.  And we are building it back up, defying the world.  God is present.  And you're going to see it more and more when the devil starts attacking in the future.  You'll see that they won't be able to do nothing with Elijah Muhammad nor his followers.  No, there's a God.  He's present.  And he's got power.  Now he teaches the messenger.  And he puts the messenger in power over the devil.  The messenger sit right over him, 4847 South Woodlawn.  He wouldn't go to no devil.  The governor called him.  Mr.  Mohammed, we'd like to speak to you.  Say, you may come.  The president called him.  Mr.  Mohammed, we'd like you to be at our inauguration.  Not me.  I don't go to the White House.  You come here.  God's man.  He sat there with architects.  Architects telling him, I studied architecture.  I'm an architect.  He said, yes, but I'm the messenger of Allah.  You do it the way I tell you it should be done.  I know what you know not and what you know.  The man, I tell you, that man Elijah Muhammad, oh, brother, the greatest black man that ever came among us.  And to prove that you're God, Elijah Muhammad was made of God right in the midst of us.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, brother.  And he's going to prove that you're God.  He's going to make one out of you in spite of yourself. ",
