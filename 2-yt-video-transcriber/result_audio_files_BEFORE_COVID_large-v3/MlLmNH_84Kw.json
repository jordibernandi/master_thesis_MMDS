Back in the 1980s, a very smart friend of mine, so smart, he was actually the one who came up with the concept for the anti-matter matter engine that Gene Roddenberry bought from him and was the catalyst for creating the engine of the USS Enterprise.  Anyways, we were doing research on cell phones.  This is, again, back in the early 1980s.  And we discovered that putting this microwave radiation next to your head was not a very good idea.  And we sat down with each other and we decided, is this something we want to do?  Do we want to go, is this going to be our cause celeb?  And I said to him, I'm a nobody.  You're a nobody.  Nobody's going to listen to us, but we're going to paint really large targets on our back.  And so we decided that was not going to be our battle to inform people about the dangers of putting these microwave generators next to people's brains.  But the situation with the 5G is these are very disruptive frequencies to life.  These are the same frequencies that are used for behavioral control by the military.  And there hasn't been any risk assessment or environmental impacts on this.  And you're going, WTF?  Why not?  This could be really dangerous.  But, you know, we live in a society where money talks.

She's like, they did an experiment of giving the plant microwaved water for a week and watch it die.  So the water's already dead when they chemically process it.
