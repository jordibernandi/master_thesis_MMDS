            "text": "Well hello folks, this is where the altar dedication took place a couple of months ago, Hanukkah.  Just coming back to the same site.  Someone said they left a cube and I have seen a picture on the internet of the cube that was left here.  But I can't see... I can't see where it is, you know.  Maybe someone has... Ah, here it is!  Look at this.  Unbelievable.  They did leave a cube, just one cube here from the altar that they used in that dedication at the last day of Hanukkah.  They did leave a perfect cube there.  Strange.  And do you remember that Georgia Guidestones thing where they took the cube and smashed it?  I do remember that.  Okay, so we're up on the side of the wall now.  I'm just going to show you this area where this Third Temple altar ritual took place, which was just down there.  So we're up on this side now.  We've got the remains of what people believe is a Roman pillar here.  These walls are obviously Ottoman era walls.  But what's interesting is that there's many Christian archaeologists who actually believe that this, you see those two, the two remains of the gate there, that this is the area where Pilate would have stood.  We've got some old bedrock steps going into the wall there, which I'll show you in a second.  This is all bedrock.  and potentially the beamer seat of judgment seat here.  where you know in this area is where many believe that Jesus was led and the crowd.  of course.  here we've got the Herodian remains of the walls just outside here which those two there and there's.  you know there's steps there with them that this is actually the area the gate of the city where Jesus would have been led when the crowd shouted crucify him.  I'm just kind of relaying to you what others have theorized and discovered, but it's pretty interesting that this is the area that they did the The altar, you know, I don't believe that they did that intentionally with the altar that this is, you know, because the police gave them the place to do this at the last minute.  So it wasn't necessarily intentional because, you know, these people don't believe in Jesus.  the Sanhedrin, etc.  So, you know, it's not necessarily an intentional thing.  But, yeah, it's just interesting, isn't it, for symbolic purposes.  You see the steps still remaining and that part of the Herodian wall still remaining.  And this is the Ottoman Empire wall.  This is the Herodian era cut into the bedrock, the steps there.  And there's the cube that they've left behind from the Third Temple altar.  This is the place where they did the Third Temple altar, lamb's leg, roasting the lamb's leg.  And of course, this is potentially between these gates.  You see the steps here, steps going up.  They are from that era, 2000 years.  Going up to this, where the gate would have been, potentially this would be the area outside the gate where the scripture says the pilot came out and the crowd didn't want to defile themselves at Passover.  So they, you know, were outside.  So those whole scenes in the gospels, where they shout to crucify him to Jesus.  It makes a lot of sense.  And so I just wanted to share that with you as what some believe, some archeologists believe is the area where all those things happened.  You can see all the remains, steps, the steps, the steps going into this gate.  Okay, so this is directly the other side of the wall to where we just were, showing where the altar dedication was and the gate from the time of Herod 2,000 years ago.  And this is the other side, directly the other side.  According to experts, if you read, this is the location where the palace was.  where Herod's palace was built by Herod and used by the Roman prefects in the years after.  Huge palace stretching this whole vast area, stretching all the way along here.  Of course, this palace has been completely destroyed in the years following the time of Jesus, during the time of Romans, 70 AD, the rebellion, the revolt.  another building built on here apparently by the Knights Templars, but that has also since gone.  So no sign of these anymore, but you can see the huge vast area where this palace would have stood and its relation to where that ancient gate was discovered.  all of this is uh dirt which has been thrown over from the other side of the wall which was originally blocking the gate.  that's now been discovered.  see all these things being discovered.  even Pontius Pilate himself there were.  they doubted that he was even a prefect called Pontius Pilate and then in recent years they discovered two pieces of clear evidence from that era.  so Yeah, so many things being discovered in our time is pretty exciting.  So yeah, just wanted to share that with you, just to give you a bit of context of where this all happened and maybe the spiritual significance, not to accuse anyone of doing that on purpose, but just the symbolism, the spiritual significance of this area.  So yeah, apparently they want to try again on Passover in April this year to get even closer to the Temple Mount.  But yeah, strange stuff, a fringe group, but strange stuff when you look at it through eyes to see exactly what's going on in the prophecy of the days we live in and how Christ is the center.  He is the one truth.  We just walk around here with my friend and talking about this, that Jesus is everything.  So turn to Jesus.  It is all about Jesus.  Turn to him in a living relationship.  Anyway, we know God is in control and we know we have an enemy who seeks to steal, kill and destroy.  Please pray that the Jewish people would come to know Jesus Christ as the Lord and Saviour.  There is a real spiritual battle as part of this, as I'm sure you're aware.  So just showing you here today, God bless you and keep walking as a disciple of Jesus. ",
