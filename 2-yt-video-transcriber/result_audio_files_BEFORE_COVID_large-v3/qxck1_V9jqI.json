I mean, he's done a bunch of stuff.  He gives talks.  He is an ex-Jehovah's Witness, and he's written about his experiences.  And he's also a fan of street epistemology as well.  And I recently reached out to him and thought he would be a great friend.  fit for our show.  so lloyd welcome to truth one and thanks so much for joining us at 2 a.m in the morning. ",

I disassociated in 2013 after going through quite a lengthy period of introspection and research and realizing I basically no longer believed.

And even if they are bothering you, they're usually very polite and kind and friendly.  So you don't like to think of such friendly people representing an organisation that's guilty of so many terrible things.  But I think that we're also just frankly living at the wrong point in history.  I think that there's far too much credence given, not credence, but there's far too much leeway given to religion in general so that organizations are able to get away with a great deal if they can just persuade people that they are religions.  So yeah, we're just living at the wrong point in history and hopefully future generations will figure out a way of holding religions to account without trampling people's freedoms of thought and conscience.

I knew they didn't celebrate birthdays and like Michael Jackson was one.  Like I think those were \u2013 I think that summed up like my facts about Jehovah's Witnesses.  And I knew that they went like door to door, but I had never actually had really any encounters with that where I grew up.  So that was kind of just like a cultural fact that I knew, but that, you know, didn't really personally apply to me.  And, you know, the more that I looked into it, I mean, really, it was voices like yours, voices like Telltale Atheist that kind of told me a lot more about what exactly, you know, the Watchtower Society is doing and what they continue, you know, have done and are continuing to do.  The history of that organization, by the way, really, really, really crazy if you understand it like in retrospect.  I think maybe at the time if you \u2013 before \u2013 and I'm talking specifically about the number of prophecies that have been made, the way that the organization has talked about specific social issues and stuff.  It's easy for me as an outsider to kind of look at that and say, wow, this is kind of ridiculous.  But \u2013 I never grew up in that kind of world.

And when you are a child and your parents are telling you, hey, Armageddon's coming very, very soon.  And if you're not a follower of this religion, you're going to be among those who are slaughtered.  so all of your school friends are going to die unless you can persuade them when you go to school that they need to join the religion as well.  so if your parents are telling you that who are you to doubt them you just assume that your parents are right and they have a good grasp on reality.  um it's only when you kind of get a bit older and perhaps there are events change in your life.  i mean in my own case i moved to a different country.  I moved to Croatia where I'm broadcasting from indeed.  And because I was no longer attending meetings, regular weekly meetings in my own language, the meetings were suddenly in Croatian and I couldn't understand what was being said.  It was like I'd hit a reset button because this constant flow of indoctrination had been interrupted and it just gave me the breathing space to think, hang on, what do I think?  What are my beliefs?  And that was what helped me to kind of reboot and figure out that I'd been in a cult for a couple of decades.  But it's not that simple.  for a lot of Jehovah's Witnesses.

So I would never just walk up to a Jehovah's Witness and say, you're in a cult, because there are far more productive ways of engaging with them.  But yes, I do consider Jehovah's Witnesses to be a cult.  But then my own view as an atheist is that virtually all religions are cults.  I see it as a spectrum.  So at the extreme end, you have groups like ISIS, and these are extreme cults.  And then at the other end of the spectrum, you have soft cults.  And it's conceivable to me that you could have a group that has very benevolent teachings that teaches, for example, that everyone should just love each other and be tolerant of each other.  But if they are in the business of lying to children and indoctrinating children with things that aren't true, they're still doing humanity a disservice.  So they're still a cult of a sort.  So I think all religions to some degree are guilty of that.  So that's why I think all religions are cults.

But I do certainly try and reach out to current and former Jehovah's Witnesses.  and i lose track of the amount of times that someone will email me and say i left the organization years or decades ago and only now through watching your videos have i finally stopped fearing armageddon.  so that's how profoundly these teachings can affect someone.  even after you've left You're still going to bed each night thinking, you know, if Armageddon comes during the night, I'm toast because I'm transgressing one of the myriad things that I'm not supposed to do if I accept Jehovah's Witness teachings.  So these are beliefs that really affect people in profound ways.  It's not unheard of for people to commit suicide, for example, especially if they've been disfellowshipped and they're being shunned by their family.
