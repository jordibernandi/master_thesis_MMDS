I'd like to start with the scripture.  jump right into it and the first scripture is Isaiah, no not Isaiah, but Ezekiel 36 and 5.  Therefore thus saith Jehovah power, surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with all the joy of their hearts with despiteful minds to cast it out for a prey.  Prophesied therefore concerning the land of Israel and saying to the mountains and to the hills and the rivers and the valleys Thus saith your power behold I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathen.  Therefore thus saith your power I have lifted up my hands.  Surely the heathen that are about you They shall bear their shame And the shame of the truth coming out about Netanyahu, about Donald Trump, about these Edomites, these Idomians, which is the Greek way of saying Edom, which are the red Hebrew Edomites, which are the people that you're looking at upon the screen.  The Bible prophesied that the Edomites would... will appoint the Holy Land into their possession, and they have.  And now they claim to be the people of the Lord. ",

Now, the myth that we're told about this, or the story, I should say, that we're told about the 1967 war is that once again, Israel was attacked by three massive armies intending to destroy it.  And once again, miraculously, we, the Israelis, prevailed.  My father says this, and several of the other generals say this, in their attempt to convince the cabinet to start the war.  And that is that the Egyptian army is not prepared for war, and therefore we must attack now.  In fact, they said the Egyptian army needs at least a year and a half to two years before it will be prepared for war.  So we have a tremendous opportunity now to once again, this will be the third time, to destroy the Egyptian army.  Not only are they not talking about an existential threat, they're not talking about any threat.  They're talking about an opportunity, a military opportunity to once again defeat the Egyptian army.  The generals, of course, won the day.  The government gave them the okay to start a preemptive strike against Egypt.  The Egyptian army was decimated in a couple of days.  The Sinai Peninsula was conquered once again.  The Gaza Strip was conquered.  And the generals wanted more.  They wanted the West Bank and they'd wanted the Golan Heights for a long time too because it's high up above the Galilee and it's, you know, there's lots of water there.  And they took that as well.  The Israeli army defeated and destroyed three Arab armies, conquered the West Bank, the Golan Heights, the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, killed over 15,000 Arab soldiers at a loss of 700 soldiers to the Israeli army.  And all this was done in six days as Arab armies were attacking them.  So again, the myth fizzles away once you actually take a look at the facts. ",

That was the president of Egypt at the time.  This is Joel.  The third chapter, verse six.  The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem.  ye have sold unto the Grecians that ye may remove them far from their border.  That's talking about the transatlantic slave trade when both, which started with the Northern Kingdom, the so-called Hispanics and Native Americans, and finished with the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, which were mostly refugee in the west coast of Africa at that time.  Behold, I will raise them up out of the place where ye have sold them and return your recompense upon your head.  And that's what you're witnessing on the highways and byways in Babylon and around the world as the camps Of GMS that are sprung up around the world and the other Israelite camps that are that are springing up are professing the fact that the Negro, Latino, Native American are indeed the true people of the Lord.  Note that there are also many, many, many heathens professing this truth this day as well.  This is biblical prophecy happening right before your face.  Verse eight.  And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabians, to a people far off, for you how I have spoken it.  So at the end, the Edomites and all the heathens that helped them will be sold into slavery.  Thus saith the Lord.  You can reference Revelation 2 and 26.  And you could also reference... Psalms, the second chapter, like verses one through eight.  For that fact. ",

Today around 50,000 people live in the Golan with Israeli Jewish settlers making up nearly half.  The rest are Syrian Druze who have largely resisted obtaining Israeli citizenship and have maintained a strong connection to Syria for decades.  In 1973, Syria attempted to liberate the Golan Heights through force, but the betrayal of the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat has foiled the operation.  In 1981, Tel Aviv passed a law that extended Israeli laws, jurisdiction, and administration to the Golan Heights, which means de facto annexation of the Syrian territory. ",

The successive American administrations also refer to the Golan Heights by occupied land, but Mr.  Trump wants to change this situation in favor of Benjamin Netanyahu before the embattled leaders bid for a fifth term in hotly contested elections scheduled for April 9.  A big oil deposit has been found in the occupied Golan Heights, with enough reserves to last Israel for decades.  This potential production may reach billions of barrels while Israel consumes 270,000 barrels per day.  The American Genie Energy Company pursued the illegal oil exploration project in the occupied Golan Heights. ",

You don't have to dig too far to find out how this genie clawed out of its oil barrel.  First, the reason it violates international law.  Genie oil has been granted permits to drill in Syria, not by Syria, but by Israel.  That's because they're going to dig in the region of Syria known as the Golan Heights, which is occupied by the Israelis now.  That occupation itself violates international law, and the drilling specifically violates the annex to the Fourth Geneva Convention.  So Israel's right to dig there is hotly contested, and yet that's exactly what's happening with genie oil.  Now for the reasons they're getting away with it.  Heading up the effort is a man named Efi Eitim.  He's a former Israeli military commander who has said in an actual speech, we cannot be with all these Arabs and we cannot give up the land because we have already seen what they do there.  Some of them may be able to stay under certain conditions, but most of them will have to go.  So this anti-Arab Israeli is heading the charge for genie oil to drill in Syria.  He makes for a powerful force to drive the drilling forward, but his cohorts are even more powerful.  Because Genie Oil investors include none other than Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch, Lord Jacob Rothschild, ex-CIA Director James Woolsey, ex-Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers, ex-Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson, and other ex-members of American government.  They are all invested in genie oil and they all stand to profit big time for drilling in the already ravaged Syria. ",
