Now, if you look here on Melissa Rivers' latest post, the top comment is someone saying that, quote, I'm convinced Obama had Joan killed for speaking the truth.  Now, obviously, we all know that.  I've gone over it a few times.  Joan Rivers tells TMZ that Michelle is a transgender, that everyone knows it, and she's definitely not kidding.  Literally a few weeks later, she dies getting a routine surgery.  That's pretty straightforward.  You don't have to be a detective to figure that one out.  You don't have to be a detective either to figure out that this is a man.  But nevertheless, that's something that anybody in the know would never dare say.  And Joan Rivers, like always, just has no filter, and she said it.  Like I said, this has been all more than covered.  We all know about this.  This is nothing new.  Comments like this are nothing new.  But what makes this one interesting is that Melissa Rivers herself liked it.  And don't forget that Melissa Rivers also opened a wrongful death suit after this and said that her death was 100% preventable.  Now, if you remember, QAnon had stated that Trump was approached to run for president and spearhead this takedown of the deep state.  Now, it had just come out that Obama had been spying on the Republicans and potential opponents going back at least as far as 2012.  Maybe taking out Joan Rivers served another purpose.  Maybe they were afraid of any possible positive support for Trump coming from Hollywood.  And if you remember... 2015 to 2017. an awful lot of celebrities died all pretty much at the same time especially the end of 2015. into the beginning of 2016 where we go one we go all. ",
