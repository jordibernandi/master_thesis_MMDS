And the part that we had selected to talk about was how we can do more for Jehovah, you know, expanding our service to Jehovah.  And one of the things that I was going to try to work into the talk was, was the part that deals with, that the society mentioned just a few weeks ago, about how the friends can give their frequent flyer miles, their travel miles.

And to be honest with you, that's what we see taking place.  The watchtower is going to use one of those three tools.  In this case, they're going to use two of them, obligation and guilt.  Oftentimes when the society makes what is called suggestions, these suggestions in the culture of Jehovah's Witnesses oftentimes will become the de facto rule.  For example, you have a witness that has a lot of miles and he's in a car group.  And he's talking about using his miles to go on vacation.  You can rest assured that there is going to be a Jehovah's Witness who's going to ask him, why don't you give them to the society?  And so witnesses will become feeling obligated.  And if they don't, they feel guilty.  And this is one of the techniques that the society has used so well.  When the society uses a lot of buzzwords, loaded languages, such as mature Christians, When I was growing up as a kid, one of the things that I often would hear is they would use the phrase mature youths, mature youths.  And so you will hear the phrase such as mature youth.  They know how to view higher education.  Well, what does that really mean?  Well, we know what that really means.  A mature youth is one who will not go to college.  And so we often see the society will use these buzzwords.  They'll set up a scenario.  Then they will explain what the criteria is.  And then they'll say that you need to meet the standard.  And so this is really just another opportunity that the society can use their obligation and their fear because now it's been held at meetings.  It's going to be talked about by the circuit overseer.  Elders will put it into their talks.  And so once again, the friends will be beat to death.  So for those who have frequent flyer miles and they don't give them to the society, you can rest assured nobody is going to commend them for keeping their frequent flyer miles. ",

            "text": "And it's like for me, like when we did the skit and we were supposed to be going to Hawaii in our skit.  And so then of course you got to set the example because you're the elder in the congregation and you're the regular pioneer.  So if you're giving this talk to the congregation and then now people hear about you going to Hawaii and you're using your mileage, then they're going to look at you and think, well, you're not setting the example.  And then it gets all misconstrued because in the JW broadcast meeting, They were saying that it's the miles that you're not going to use.  Eventually that becomes the mileage that you should just be donating because they're asking for it.  Then they begin to compare you to people in other countries.  They can't afford this, they can't afford that.  And I remember back in the 80s, There was this talk that was circulating and this brother was talking about the people in Western countries.  And he said, you guys got your washing machines and your drying machines.  And he was giving this talk and he was trying to make people feel guilty because in other countries they could afford to buy these machines to wash the clothes.  So then he was kind of like comparing that to people in other countries and how they didn't have these things and how we didn't appreciate spiritual things because we had all of these modern conveniences.  And so it just went downhill from there.  Everybody listening to this video knows this is true because the next thing you have happening is your spirituality is now being called into question whether or not you are giving away these rewards.  And so it becomes the culture.  People begin to look at you funny.  You're not doing this.  You're not doing that.  You already have all of these things, extra things you already don't need.  It's just crazy, crazy, crazy. ",
