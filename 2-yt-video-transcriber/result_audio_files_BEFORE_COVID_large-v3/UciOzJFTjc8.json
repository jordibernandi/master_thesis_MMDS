But your position, you just said, is that there's no real distinction between the two.  It doesn't really matter.  Enslaved Palestine, free Palestine, you know God, Josh.  You know Him.  You do.  You know them, you turned away from them, and now you've grabbed a hold of stuff that's not going to help you.  It's not helping you, Josh.  I believe that deep down you know the God that I'm talking about.  You feel this passionate about this issue of free Palestine because you're in the image of God and you know that it's wrong to oppress other image bearers of God.  You haven't been able to shake your Christianity loose completely.  Of course not.  But you never knew Christ truly to begin with, and that's why we're here today.  It's not to win debates.  It's not to fight with you.  It's to tell you this.  Listen, the message of Jesus isn't what you thought, Josh.  It wasn't about you somehow knowing about this guy named Jesus who did these things and you're going to be a better person to climb your way to him.  It's that he came to save sinners.  He is holy.  And you said something in the beginning, Josh.  I'll just say this last thing.  I don't want to dominate the conversation, but you said, The idea of, hell, I can't accept the idea of eternal punishment.  But think about two things.  One, is you already gave up moral judgments.  You said it doesn't matter.  So there is nothing wrong with someone spending eternity punished.  Because there is no moral judgments. ",

I think better than you think He is.  But He's also just, and He's holy, and we are sinners.  And we've offended Him, and we hate Him.  We run away from Him, we construct these complicated worldviews that are just a mess, and we don't want in the knowledge of God.  And so that, we don't know how holy God is.  So when we hear of His eternal punishment, we think that seems excessive, but that just shows that we don't understand His holiness and the gravity of our sin.  And that's what you need to know.  The message of Jesus is about the love and justice of God.  He satisfies what we deserve for our sins, and He gives us a righteousness that we don't deserve.  And it's a gift, Josh.  The call of the gospel is to turn from your sin, to trust in Him, to be saved now.  I don't want you to think, Josh, that it was about climbing to Jesus for salvation.  That wasn't it.  But Josh, I want you to know Him.  And I believe from the moment you walked up here, You came up, and I so appreciated that you did, man.  Because you came up and you actually acted like something matters in this world.  And I respect that.  But I just want you to consider this.  You've grabbed a hold of a position now where nothing does matter.  But you didn't act like that.  And you're not acting like it, Josh, with this t-shirt.  You can know Christ, Josh.  Can I give you my number?  No, thank you.  Okay.  Well, I'm Jeff. ",
