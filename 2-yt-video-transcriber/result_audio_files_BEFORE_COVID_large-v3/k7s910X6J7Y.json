And what I'd like to visit with you today on is this... request from the administration and also from Dan Coats, the Director of National Security, who's on his way out, but also supported by the President, obviously, and that is to reauthorize NSA spying funds.  Well, this seems to be so strange.  I know you know this issue, but, you know, this has been a big deal.  You know, even when I was still back in Congress, that was when, of course, the Patriot Act was passed over to my strong objection.  But buried in that was the ability to spy on American people.  And the revelation to what they were doing and how they were abusing it was made by Ed Snowden, who became a hero for anybody who cared about civil liberties in our Constitution.  And this was a big deal, and it was a political deal.  And as you recall so clearly, they... They went back to work, you know, to redo it, fix it.  We've been exposed, so we're going to do something.  And that was dangerous because they made it worse.  So they took the Patriot Act and turned it into the Freedom Act and the Freedom Act.  And things have actually gotten worse.  That's to expire, as I understand, at the end of this year.  And as you well know, It's not very effective except for the damage it does.  You know, it's not good in trying to protect anybody.  So it is an important issue, but for a lot of people it's esoteric.  But for anybody who cares about personal liberty and the Fourth Amendment ought to be very concerned about what's going on. ",

And as you say, when Ed Snowden blew the whistle on the fact that it was the government considering us the terrorists and spying on all of our stuff, and Americans did get up in arms for a brief period.  In fact, they got so up in arms that it frightened the deep establishment, and that's why they reacted.  But, you know, the first cue, Dr.  Paul, that something was wrong here is when the same guy who wrote the Patriot Act, Sensenbrenner, wrote the Freedom Act.  So, I mean, that was a bit of a clue.  But as you point out, the Patriot Act, what Snowden showed is that the NSA and the U.S.  government was doing terrible, illegal things, stealing our information, spying on us.  And what did the Freedom Act do?  But it made it legal for them to do it.  And they always do the same thing.  They say, oh, it's going to sunset.  Don't worry.  It's just temporary, just temporary.  But whenever it gets close and they start blowing the panic button, you know, pushing the panic button. ",

If they're talking about freedom, actually, it should be named the Tyranny Act, a bold step toward tyranny.  That's what they're doing.  uh but the amazing thing to me is uh even coats admitted you know there's too expensive.  it's not very efficient but just in case someday we need this we want it on on the books and it's uh so absurd.  and and uh it's amazing that they can sell it with such lousy pr.  but they do and it looks like uh it'll probably get uh passed who knows.  but uh i hope a few people wake up and say hey Don't renew this.  Don't reauthorize it.  We should get rid of it and make a strong statement of why it shouldn't even exist. ",

They say even though we don't need it, even though they've been caught collecting hundreds of millions of more records than they're allowed to, because they can't control this beach that they created.  Even when all that happens, even though, you know, a lot of people that follow this closely say they're not even using the Freedom Act.  They're using something, I think it was under Reagan, an executive order to collect this stuff.  They don't even need it.  But they still want to have that veneer of legality.

They always want a confession.  And then that makes it a confess to it.  We can do it.  And they buy into that.  But the other part of what the administration is asking for is this is just not a delay.  It's not tinkering.  They want it permanent.  They're getting tired of asking for this to come up every time.  Maybe the Congress will get tired of it.  But the other point is they're going to use some law someplace, and they'll still do it because it is a lawless government.  It's a lawless society.  Of course, it's been going on.  And if you approach anything we have done in Washington for the last 50 or 100 years, technically, where is the authority?  Where is it in Article I, Section 8. that said, this is what you guys are allowed to do?  It's not there yet.  And the questions aren't asked, and they tinker around these edges.  And I just really get annoyed about the imperial presidency, you know, that the executive orders can be written.  They can go to war without permission, and Congress rolls over.  And, of course, because we have an empire, we have too many other countries that are willing to roll over for us and, you know, to permit us to pursue our total control of the world through finances.  And we hear on a daily basis how the sanctions are backfiring and all the problems going on in the Middle East.  But it doesn't seem, though, that all of a sudden we're going to have wisdom seep into the Congress and they're going to do the right thing.  But I still think it's very important for us and anybody that views our program to spread the message the best they can.  Try to get people.  Figure out a way you can reach people.  That is still... You know, the only thing that is available to it used to be that it was automatic with the internet, but even that has some shortcomings.  So the one-on-one using people's email lists and all, it's still permissible.  It's still, you know, there's still a way to pass a message around.  And that's the way it's been throughout history.  So I hope this stirs some people up and I hope people reach, you know, can reach out to their friends and neighbors and family.  And, you know, this is pretty serious, you know, and I don't think I don't think the American people are quite worried about it because it just happens, you know.  And I sense the whole feeling, Daniel, of what it is like, you know, what can we do to stop it?  But I still believe strongly it's information and understanding that we have to continue with. ",

But, you know, this whole this whole coach letter, you know, this is the one of the last things he did before leaving.  But the whole Dan Coats letter to Congress, it kind of reminds me almost of what they did on the budget.  Dr.  Paul, they said, we're tired of coming back to increase the spending limits.  Let's just get rid of the whole thing.  And that's the tool.  That's the tool they used to twist arms.  You remember back during the October 2001 debate on the Patriot Act, there were some people on the fence.  And what they used to twist their arms is, hey, don't worry, this is a crisis situation.  These are temporary.  They're going to sunset.  We have to temporarily suspend our civil liberties.  And that was the promise.  And now they don't even have that fig leaf.  They just say, make it permanent.  Get rid of spending caps.  Get rid of our civil liberties.  But I just want to point out that there are four aspects of the so-called Freedom Act that they want to make permanent.  First of all is the NSA's intercept of our phone calls and texts, which in 2017 collected half a billion records.  The second is a provision allowing the NSA to go to court to get business records for those it suspects for national security reasons.  The third is the wiretap lone wolf, which is where they can wiretap people who aren't connected to any foreign governments.  And the last one, the fourth one, is to continue wiretapping someone if they get a different phone.  So these are the things that are all supposed to sunset in December.  And these are the things that Dan Coats tells Congress we want to make permanent.  You know, it's all done in the name of fighting terrorism.  So we're probably going to start hearing a lot more about terrorism if Americans get stirred up about this. ",

I hope we're able to keep up with this and inform our viewers and listeners about what's happening and encourage everybody to do what they can to spread this message.  And that means, you know, occasionally if you happen to know a member of Congress, grab them and pack to them and let them know.  Because quite frankly... The members that I knew so often, you know, they were working in their office.  They're talking to constituents and who knows who, and then they walk to the floor and they don't even know what the bill is.  And they have to walk over and ask the manager of the bill.  And they look at a pad of paper and they say, what is this bill?  What are we working on?  Oh, who supports this bill?  And then they look at a list.  So they're, they're not up to date.  And, and I know it's frustrating to think you're one, one, one vote, one person.  But no, they will pay attention if a person is credible and if there's more than one person.  And I think that's the difference.  And there can be some changes, but it's very, very tedious.  But it all goes back to one thing, and that is the education and understanding of the electorate on what do they really want.  And unfortunately, we still have an electorate which includes those in the military industrial complex that they've adopted this philosophy that deficits don't matter.  You can print money if you need it.  And the Constitution is a document we don't have to worry about.  And we have a moral responsibility to take care of the people who are in need.  And we have a moral responsibility to police the world.  And they believe this.  So it's a pretty hard thing.  But we need to curtail their activities. ",
