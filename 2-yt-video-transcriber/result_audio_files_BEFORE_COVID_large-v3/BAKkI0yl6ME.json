As of 2016, the Sackler family has a net worth totaling $14 billion.  The Sackler family is behind the blockbuster painkiller drug Oxycontin.  The Sacklers push this highly addictive drug through their pharmaceutical company, Purdue, and rake in $3 billion in profit every year.  It is well documented that OxyContin is one of the major reasons behind the devastating opioid epidemic.  While the Sackler family has made billions of dollars creating, feeding, and worsening people's addictions, they go out of their way to change the narrative and instead focus attention on their philanthropic efforts in the arts, education, and sciences, like donations to fund the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard.  and funding a wing in the new york metropolitan museum of art and they even had an asteroid named after them by the leyden observatory.  don't get me wrong this family isn't all about charity and definitely enjoys a lavish lifestyle.  dame theresa sackler a board member of purdue owns a forty five million dollar upper east side apartment in new york.  beverly sackler another member of purdue owns a waterfront estate in greenwich connecticut worth an estimated fifteen million dollars.  david sackler son of oxycontin creator richard sackler purchased a twenty two point five million dollar bell air mansion in cash.  As much as the Sacklers want to build their image around philanthropic efforts, the victims and their families can never forget the losses they've experienced at the hands of the Sacklers' greed. ",
