It's important to remember that the Democrats vowed to impeach President Trump literally just minutes after he was inaugurated as president on January 20th, 2017.  As the Washington Post admits, the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.  Democrats are getting so desperate after the impeachment day dud that some are resorting to the old Trump rallies are empty line and posting images of the exits where the fire marshals require that there be plenty of open space.  But this is what it actually looked like inside the rally as usual, completely packed to the rafters with thousands and thousands of people waiting outside for hours in sub-zero temperatures to be there.  And if you haven't listened to the Democrats complain enough this week, there's another debate tonight, which will probably be the lowest rated in history because I'm pretty sure the entire country has heard enough of them for this year.
