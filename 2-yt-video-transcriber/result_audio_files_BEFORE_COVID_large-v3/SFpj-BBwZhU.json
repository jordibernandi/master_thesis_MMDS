So let's dissect it and see if she's right.  Let's get into it.  For those of you who might not be familiar, The Atheist Experience is a live call-in show that's run by the ACA, or the Atheist Community of Austin.  I've seen every single episode, up to a certain point.  They used to be on Public Access TV every Sunday, but Public Access has been dying out for years, so eventually they fully switched over to YouTube.  I kinda dropped off when they did the switch.  But I know Matt Dillahunty, one of the hosts and the current president of the ACA, and I asked if he was okay with me covering this call on my channel.  He approved.  So let's take a look and see what kind of proof this Jehovah's Witness has. ",

            "text": "Okay, let's start here.  Matt and Don are correct.  Blood transfusions are banned for Jehovah's Witnesses, and it's mainly based off of a verse in the Old Testament that talks about eating blood.  I looked up the word in the interlinear version of the Bible.  It doesn't say anything about using blood products in any way.  It doesn't mention using it for medical purposes.  Granted, they didn't have hypodermic needles 5,000 years ago, but they did have doctors, and naturally those doctors would deal with blood sometimes.  They didn't reference blood in a medical context at all in the verses Jehovah's Witnesses talk about.  The word used specifically translates to eat.  You can't eat blood, and when it says eat, it specifically means consuming through your mouth and into your stomach.  That's what it's talking about.  And the fact that they ban it for medical purposes is even more ridiculous when you consider the fact that they're de facto demanding human sacrifices.  God only ever demanded a human sacrifice three times in the Bible.  Once with Jephthah, when he said he would sacrifice the first thing to come out of his house when he got home from war, if God helped him win it.  And that thing happened to be his daughter.  Once when God demanded Abraham sacrifice his son Isaac, but then he put a stop to it, so I guess it doesn't technically count.  And finally, the third instance is when he had Jesus sacrificed.  Every other type of sacrifice to God was animals or other various things.  Never people.  So when Jehovah's Witnesses demand human sacrifice in the form of martyring yourself, rather than taking a blood transfusion, just remember, it isn't biblical.  You aren't sacrificing yourself to God.  You're sacrificing yourself to the Watchtower Society.  And I just wanted to touch on what Don said about the hundreds of end times predictions Jehovah's Witnesses make.  We're gonna get into it more in a minute, but I did an entire video on the many end-of-the-world predictions they've made.  Their most significant predictions happened in the late 1800s, in 1913, and then 1914, in 1925, and in 1975.  The 1975 one is pretty important because it was fairly recently, and they went as far as to retroactively change the content of their literature to make it seem less serious than it was.  They even had a phrase, Stay Alive to 75.  If you're on your deathbed, just make it a little longer.  One more day, one more week, one more month.  Stay alive to 75, and you'll never have to die.  Lots of people left after that.  My parents joined in the late 70s, early 80s, so they didn't see it take place, but my mom did tell me about it when I was young.  She said the Watchtower Society never claimed it was coming, but some people in the religion thought so.  So the members were to blame, not the society.  Of course, that's completely untrue.  It was all over their literature.  It was in their public talks.  It was everywhere.  Just to give a quick explanation of why they thought 1975 was going to be the end.  The reason is because they calculated it to be about 6,000 years after the world was created.  And everybody knows that God works in sevens.  So they believed that they were at the start of the 7,000th year.  More Bible numerology.  They're famous for that.  And yeah, that is what we called it when I was younger, by the way.  The society.  Sounds pretty ominous looking back on it. ",

Now we know that 1914 wasn't the end of the world, it was just the beginning of the next phase of the end of the world.  They try to fit events into their narrative by saying that it makes sense that 1914 was the beginning of the end because World War I started in October 1914.

            "text": "Nope, that is completely incorrect.  All of it.  Let me clarify the doctrine and then we'll poke some holes in it.  This is based on Bible math that people have been calculating for centuries.  The Millerite movement in the 1800s really picked this up and ran with it.  There's a verse in the book of Daniel that talks about Nebuchadnezzar losing his mind and living like a cow, grazing off the land and whatnots for seven times.  The Bible doesn't go beyond that.  That's all it has to say about it.  But Jehovah's Witnesses read an extra special meaning into that, claiming that God revealed some special information to them.  claiming that the prophecy Daniel described about Nebuchadnezzar represents another prophecy that the Bible never mentions.  So they're basically making up this whole thing on the spot and claiming God told it to them.  They say that Nebuchadnezzar's fall represents the end of the world too.  Remember, the Bible said Nebuchadnezzar would lose his mind for seven times.  So how long is seven times?  Well, Revelation 11 describes three and a half times as 1,260 days.  So 1,260 days times two is 2,520 days.  Still not sure how they arrive at 1914?  Give it a minute.  It gets real convoluted.  The next verse they use is Numbers 14.33.  It says, \"...and your children shall wander in the wilderness for forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the  wilderness.\".  After the number of days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities even forty years.  So there you have it.  A day for a year.  The Bible says it.  Although it's completely out of context.  Doesn't matter.  It's said, so Jehovah's Witnesses are going to use it.  That puts them up to 2,520 years instead of days.  Now they have to find a point from which to start counting.  Back when they adopted this Bible math, Jehovah's Witnesses decided to start counting from the fall of Jerusalem, which they believed to be in 606-607 BCE.  Add 2,520 years to 607 BCE, accounting for the fact that there's no year zero.  It just went from 1 BCE to 1 CE, and it puts you at 1914.  Except that's not when Jerusalem fell.  It fell in 587 BCE, not 607 BCE.  We found out later by unearthing tons of cuneiform tablets.  The Babylonians were impeccable record keepers.  They kept so many receipts and records that some may say it was too much.  We know more about that time in history than almost any other because of their record keeping.  we can say without a shadow of a doubt that Jerusalem fell in 587, not 607, 20 years later.  So there you go.  I just debunked the entire prophecy.  Let's continue listening. ",

Even if the Bible actually made the prediction, point blank, that the end would start exactly 1914 years after Jesus' birth, I still wouldn't have a legitimate reason to believe it.  But that isn't what happened.  The Bible doesn't even mention this math.

It reaffirms everything they believed about the world, and about their prophecies, about how they're going to be persecuted in the end times.  In fact, that's why she's bringing it up in the first place.  She used it as proof that the end is here, because it says Jehovah's Witnesses will be persecuted.  Banning religions isn't helpful at all.  It just adds fuel to the fire.  The next clip is kind of unrelated to the subject, but I wanted to include it anyways, because I feel like it's important. ",

It's mutilation.  And it was originally started by the guy who invented cornflakes.  His name was Kellogg.  In fact, he was a Seventh Day Adventist.  He invented cornflakes, an extremely bland cereal, to try to kill people's sex drive.  He also started circumcision in the U.S.  for the same reason.  Before circumcision really caught on, he tried to start a different trend.  He'd have doctors stitch a silver wire on so that if the person became interested, it would start tearing through skin.  Never mind the fact that it happens naturally at night and there's nothing you can do to stop it.  Never mind the fact that it happens 12 times a day on average for any reason or no reason at all.  This will be incentive to prevent people from thinking bad thoughts.  It's horrific and evil and it should be done away with.  There's no legitimate reason for it.

Don't walk into an oppositional situation.  These people are literally being controlled by Satan.  It's really not often you get a glimpse into the mindset like this.  So I really appreciate Matt letting me cover this on my channel, and I respect the hell out of Matt and Don for what they're doing.  I absolutely love this show.  I think it adds so much value to the community.  So again, thanks to both Matt and Don, and everybody at the ACA.  You guys did a great job addressing this person's claims.  Hopefully we can get to see more of this from the Atheist Experience.  Anyways, I linked the original clip in the description if you guys want to give it a watch.  I think it's worth it.  Okay, that's all I've got for you.  If you like what I do and you want to make sure I can continue to do it, you can support me in a few ways.  First, you can support me on Patreon.  That's probably the best way.  But if you want to get something back for your support, you can check out my Teespring.  I'm trying to make a shirt design for every cult I've covered.  I haven't gotten every one, but I'm working on it.  So check it out and see if your cult is up there.  Second, you can support me by checking out my game shop.  I sell controller, cartridge, and game box stands for every system from the original Nintendo and Sega Game Gear to the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.  So give that a look too.  And finally, if you want to support me in some way other than monetarily, you can check out my other YouTube channels.  I have a retro game channel where I answer questions like, why does Shy Guy have a mask, and why are CRT TVs the best way to play retro games?  I also have the podcast where I talk about stuff I don't feel I can say on a monetized channel.  And finally, I have my main channel, where I talk about cults.  I wish I didn't have to worry about dancing around subjects carefully in the first place, but I chose to do this as a full-time job, so unfortunately, I rely on YouTube's AdSense.  and on the support of patrons to continue doing the work I do.  Anyways, check me out in all those places if you haven't already.  Thanks for listening, guys. ",
