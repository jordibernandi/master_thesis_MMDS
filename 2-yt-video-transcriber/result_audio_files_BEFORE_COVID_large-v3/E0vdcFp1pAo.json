            "text": "Jeremy Clarkson has written an amazing tweet.  It's only five words long, but does it pack a punch?  So let's see what our old friend Sadiq Khan has been up to, shall we?  Last time we looked, London was a complete mess.  So has anything improved for 2019?  Well, knife crime increased by 52% since Khan became mayor.  Residential burglaries are up by 37%.  Robberies are up by 59%.  There were 135 murders in 2018.  That's a 26% increase since 2016.  There have been over 50 murders already in 2019 as of the 7th of June.  This is the highest homicide rate in over a decade for London.  Kahn was given a budget to build 116,000 affordable new homes.  He has only started construction on 30% of them.  He has wasted \u00a383 million including \u00a3400,000 on a beach party and \u00a310 million for police officers that take a test to assign their personality a colour.  He pays a PR firm \u00a313 million a year using public finances.  He has cost the TfL 640 million pounds by freezing fares so they are not keeping up with inflation.  Meanwhile TfL employee costs have increased from 4.9 million pounds to 10.8 million pounds since he took over as mayor.  He's also failed to reduce the cost of bus travel as he promised.  On the subject of his promises, he still failed to plant 2 million trees as promised.  He's failed to set up his own energy company as promised.  He's failed to end strike action as promised.  So what the hell has Sadiq Khan been doing?  Well, exactly as he was last year, just getting into the fights with Donald Trump and John Cleese, virtue signalling and virtue signalling and virtue signalling.  There is a petition calling for Sadiq Khan to be fired as mayor of London.  I have included it in the show notes.  If you're in the area, I encourage you to sign the petition.  This man is a disgrace and he needs to get out.  Now get out. ",
