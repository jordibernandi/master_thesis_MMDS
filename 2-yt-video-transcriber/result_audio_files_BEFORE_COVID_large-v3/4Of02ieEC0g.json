We don't know what came before that.  It appears that we can't know what came before that.  And in fact, we don't even know if there was such a thing as before that.  Maybe there was, maybe there wasn't.  We don't know.  Some cosmological models have eternal time, an infinite past, with the Big Bang simply being a transition from one state to another.  While other cosmological models have the universe and time itself beginning with a quantum nucleation event that marks the beginning of the expansion, if you will.  And the term beginning is not necessarily appropriate.  It gets really weird when you're starting to talk about the beginning of time.  because there was nothing before that, so how did it begin?  Time has always been going on.  It gets really weird, the terminology becomes very weird.
