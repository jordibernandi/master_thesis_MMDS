Let's do an example.  I'm a single mom.  I'm by the side of the road.  My car is broken down.  I need money right now.  I pick up my cell phone.  I go to Speedy Cash, an online lender.  I'm in California.  I have to get to work.  I have to have the cash to fix my car to get to work.  I can barely read the little disclosure on my phone.  The cost at Speedy Cash is, you may wanna write this down, $10 per $100 borrowed.  I need $200 to fix my car.  The origination fee is $20.  The term of the loan is two weeks, typical for when I get paid.  What is the APR?  And if you'd like a calculator, we have one for you. ",
