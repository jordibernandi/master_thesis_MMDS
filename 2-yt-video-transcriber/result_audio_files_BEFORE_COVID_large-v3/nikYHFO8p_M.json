In England and Australia, it's certainly not considered a cuss word.  If anything, but should be a bad word because it has four letters and its only meaning is rear end.  But I hear believers say but all the time, unapologetically, as they're talking about their brand new skinny jeans or where they're going to sit in congregation.  But has no alternative definitions for one to ponder and give the speaker any kind of coverage from assault.  And assault does come.  If you call anybody buttface, everybody knows what you mean.  There is no ambiguity with it whatsoever.  but not so with ass, Genesis 16, 12.  Ishmael, and he shall be a wild ass among men.  His hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him, and he shall dwell against all  his.\".  The spiritual reality that I was hoping to communicate to you all is to see that too many of you are offended with me that you failed to grasp the French word double entendre, hence my employment of the phrase during my video on Shabbat.  Excuse my French.  Can you not see that the calendar cowboys are producing Ishmaels, not Isaacs?  They're producing works of the flesh that are soulish to the core.  Their calendars cannot produce faith.  Faith is an Isaac, but Ishmael is trying to produce a soulish work.  And once exposed, Ishmael's hand shall be turned against men, and he'd love to employ your hand in his support against me too.  You see, I'm a big believer in context.  And if I were worried about getting punished for saying arse, I wouldn't have said it, but I did.  Maybe next time I'll use my Surrey accent better and say arse and pretend I'm a pirate.  You can get away with almost anything if you pretend you're a pirate, but apparently you can't get away with much if you try to expose the agenda of Ishmael.  Lighten up, everybody.  Ishmael is an arse and he pulled his calendar out of his arse.  Am I talking saddlebags or am I talking like a pirate?  Well, that really depends on whether you're in the camp of Ishmael or whether you're in the camp of Isaac.  Are you producing Ishmael's or are you producing Isaac's? ",
