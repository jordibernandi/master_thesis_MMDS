And then for whatever reason, it's all being blamed on the individual.  Really, we have a systemic transformation of our economy.  And schools that don't really meet the needs of a lot of boys in particular, because they emphasize conformity and rigidity, And at that age, like a lot of boys, you know, like aren't really well designed for that in the same way that young girls are, frankly.  And so we need to start addressing these issues from the ground up.  Hey, how are you?  And it starts, I mean, to me, it's beyond our schools at this point because there are so many young men, almost one out of, five prime working age American men is out of the workforce.  And again, it all gets laid at their feet like it's all their fault.  But in my mind, it's structural.  And it's giving rise to all of these dysfunctions in families, in communities.  There are a lot of men that feel like they're not going to ever get married, have a family, have a stable career, and everything else.  And for whatever reason, we're ignoring what strikes me as a real crisis. ",
