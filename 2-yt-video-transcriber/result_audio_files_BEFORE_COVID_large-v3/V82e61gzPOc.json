            "text": "One out of every six Americans currently owes money on a federal student loan.  Recent college graduates are leaving school with an average of $38,000 worth of debt.  In total, 46 million Americans owe about $1.6 trillion in student loans.  To put that in perspective, in the year 2000, the total amount of student loan debt in the United States was less than $100 billion.  It's important to understand that student loans aren't like other types of loans.  For example, if you declare bankruptcy, you can get most types of loans canceled and forgiven.  This is not the case with student loans.  You cannot get rid of your student loan by declaring bankruptcy.  Basically, the only two ways to get rid of student loans is to either pay them off or to die.  You could also flee the country and never return, or you could fake your own death, but to put it mildly, there are some drawbacks to those options.  Now, before you start looking into flights to New Zealand, let's try to fully understand the problem and see how we got here.  Studies show that student loan debt is holding people back from buying homes, investing in businesses and starting families.  This is especially true with millennials, who would rather live in a tiny home or a van down by the river than take out a home mortgage and saddle themselves with even more debt.  In short, the student debt crisis is creating a stagnant economy and is holding people back from fulfilling the American dream.  So, how did we get here?  Over the last few decades, several factors have combined to create a perfect storm of problems.  One, funding for higher education has been decreasing over time, and this has pushed colleges and universities to increase their costs dramatically to make up the difference.  Two, the Great Recession of 2008 made it hard for people to find jobs, and many people decided to go back to school to make themselves more attractive to employers.  And three, in the US, over the past 40 to 50 years, we have overemphasized college as the best path for everyone, and we've underemphasized trade schools and vocational training.  This is how we end up with baristas with PhD-level education.  So what's the solution?  Economic studies show that canceling all student loan debt would basically amount to a giant economic stimulus package that would help close the wealth gap, generate about 1.5 million jobs every year, and bring in about 1 trillion dollars in gross domestic product over the first 10 years.  People would buy houses, start families, spend money on vacations, and launch new small businesses.  What's interesting is that even though most people associate this idea with the liberal wing of American politics, there's unexpected bipartisan support for it.  Wayne Johnson, the Trump-appointed official who was in charge of overseeing the entirety of our federal student debt, is not only calling for the cancellation of most student loan debt, he's proposing a $50,000 tax credit for people who've already paid off their federal loans.  The student loan debt crisis is a uniquely American problem.  No other developed country in the world struggles with this, mainly because other countries have chosen to reinvest in their society by making higher education free or very low cost.  Because of this, most American plans to cancel student debt are paired with a plan to make colleges and universities tuition free.  We all reap the benefits of having a smarter society unencumbered by crushing economic debt.  Hey, if we could bail out the banks after they crash the entire global economy, we can certainly bail out the American workers.  Peace. ",
