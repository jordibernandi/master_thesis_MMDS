            "text": "Hello, I'm here on the hot couch and that means that it's time for me to answer all of your most burning Preguntas.  That's right, it's the 10k subscriber special.  Well, I actually have like 12,000 now, so that's cool, I guess.  Anyway, let's start.  So this first question is the most important one.  It's the one that I get the most.  It's basically, will you make a video on X topic?  Please make a video on this.  When will you talk about this?  Hey man, I can help you to make a video on this.  All that sort of thing.  While I appreciate the enthusiasm, like I never imagined that so many people would care so much about what I have to say about things, I don't think I'm ever really going to be taking suggestions for videos like that.  Firstly, it actually takes a lot of time to make most of my videos, like the longer ones that are more than 20 minutes or so, those take about two weeks between writing the script, researching, filming, setting everything up to film as well, then editing, rendering, getting it out there, all the promotion that I need to do, stuff like that.  So for me to at least be able to enjoy the work that I'm doing, I need to be making videos about topics that I want to make videos on.  And I really have no shortage of ideas myself or things that I'd like to create.  There's also another important thing which is that I don't know everything about everything, you know?  A lot of the time, people are just asking me to cover topics that they probably already know more about than what I do.  I'm not the right person to make a video on everything.  Again, I do appreciate a lot that people like my content so much and they want to see my opinion on all these different topics.  That's just not really how I do things.  I like to stick to topics where I feel like I already have at least, you know, a fairly solid grounding or where I can put out like a hot, hot take really quickly.  In many respects, the only difference between me and you is that I have the time and the equipment and the kind of technical knowledge needed to make videos like this.  And I feel like people are kind of trying to project their knowledge and their interests onto me, and I'm just not the right person for that, guys.  Sorry.  So, question number two.  Why did you move to Argentina?  Well, first, I studied Spanish in university, and I always wanted to move somewhere in Latin America while studying Spanish.  It was kind of... planned, I guess.  Second, I watch a lot of Argentine cinema and I really like the look of the country just in that sort of idealized cinematic lens, I guess.  And I ended up coming here last year on a student exchange to finish the last semester of my degree.  And well, after that was done, I went home for a little bit more and then I decided to come back and stay.  So yeah, here I am.  I like it, I guess.  So next question, this is a good one.  Where do you find reliable sources in journalism?  Are there any media outlets that you can recommend?  So I mostly stick to mainstream news sources that kind of report what happened and when, and I use these to draw my own conclusions.  That means that I avoid opinion.  I mostly just stick to the news cycle.  And yeah, the news cycle is still very biased.  But depending on how you look at it, you can definitely sift through the crap and get to the good stuff and actually form an informed opinion of what's going on yourself.  Now, that might sound difficult, and maybe it is, but I don't really know how I got to this point.  I just kind of read the news for years and years and years, kept up on politics and stuff like that.  So it's not something that I tried to do.  It's just something that I learned how to do myself in practice.  But I guess for the outlets I look at, I mostly read El Pais in Spanish and the BBC in English.  Again, these are very biased, neoliberal sort of outlets.  But the sad fact is there just isn't any left-leaning sort of breaking news people who cover everything.  So we have to work with what we've got and just make sure that when we read it that we remember the conclusions that they're trying to lead us towards and avoid them.  Favorite empanada.  Well, I don't have a specific flavor, but in the city of Buenos Aires, there is a tiny little bakery called El Secreto de la Ni\u00f1a del Oro.  It's on Avenida Santa Fe in Palermo.  It's a small little bakery, but they have the best beef, I guess, carne empanada in the world.  That is my favorite empanada.  Everyone should try it.  It's incredible.  If you go there, say hi to Fernando for me.  What type of leftist would you describe yourself as?  No comment.  What are your favorite novels?  First, Janet Winterson, The Passion.  I love that book.  I'm not quite sure why.  It's also really short, so I highly recommend it if you're looking for a kind of short book to read.  And my next two are really stereotypical and boring.  Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky and Portrait by James Joyce.  What topics would you not touch over a 10-foot pole?  Well, I'm not very interested in North Korea and basically anything that I don't really know too much about.  So that's a lot of topics, I can't really list them.  What is your opinion on more controversial leftists such as Walsh?  Well, my opinion is that there's probably a reason that all of these like really abrasive, shouty white men have a background in gaming.  I don't believe that these people are genuinely interested in the anti-wokeskulled sort of thing because that's really what they believe is best for the left.  I think it's just a part of their personality that they picked up from gaming and they aren't willing to change, so they're trying to make everyone else change to be more like them.  It's a very selfish sort of mentality and definitely not what we need.  And I also think that Vaush in particular is kind of ridiculous because in the grand scheme of things, He's a guy running a niche stream on the internet who's not having any sort of meaningful influence on anything.  And he seems to believe that he's the uniter of the left, the coalition builder, when really he's a guy at home entertaining people.  That's what we're doing.  BreadTube is not a revolution, it's a consumer demographic.  I make these videos because I enjoy doing it.  I don't do it because I believe myself to be some sort of leader of a movement.  It would be nice if they had the additional effect of pushing people further left, or just educating people in general.  But I don't see myself as the sort of important savior, thought leader, like people like Vosch do.  And I think it's really unhealthy that they think that.  I think it's very egotistical.  And I think that's really more of the gamer mentality seeping in.  Because generally, people who take online gaming seriously are incredibly egotistical and toxic.  And he's definitely an example of that.  Since you're Aussie as well, would you ever do a debate or collaboration with, say, friendly Geordies?  No, FriendlyGeordie is not a good person.  He's extremely transphobic.  He's a Labor Party shill.  He has been for a very long time.  Just look at how little he's criticized Labor after the election.  Labor has turned into Liberal Party lite, facilitating the Liberals in every single little thing they do, just providing minor token opposition here and there.  And he's not talking about it basically at all.  The only reason that he gets a pass from the Australian left is because the Australian left doesn't have these sorts of like YouTube personalities to follow.  So everyone latches onto him because he's the only one there and everyone just pretends that he's like some sort of radical leftist, when really he's just an obnoxious Labor Party centrist.  He works to delegitimize anyone further left than Labor, such as the Greens.  You know, I'm just not really down with that.  While I think that he does do a good job of shitting on the Liberal Party, there's more to Australian politics than that.  Moving the Labor Party further left is extremely important and he's just not interested in doing that.  He'll shill for them no matter what they do.  What are your favourite films?  Good question.  Not one that I really think about that much.  Favourite Hollywood sort of film I think would be The Prestige.  I think it's like the only twist film that ever really tricked me.  And also it has David Bowie.  I do like a lot of Argentine films and a lot of films from Spain as well.  My favourite Spanish film is probably Mondays in the Sun .  Amazing film starring a lot of huge names that became really famous later like Javier Bardem.  My favorite Argentine films?  Well, oof, tough question.  There are a lot.  There's the obvious ones, I feel, like, The Secret in Their Eyes, Nine Queens, you know, basically, La Cargar\u00edn.  But there's also less known ones I like, like Minimal Stories, Historias Minimas, which is a film filmed in Patagonia, and everyone in it is not, like, a professional actor.  They're just random people that they found there to basically play themselves.  And it turned out incredible.  Another one that I watched recently is called The Snatch Thief in English.  It's about a motorcycle thief who regrets something that he does.  And well, I really liked it.  I don't know.  I like tons of Argentine cinema.  I could really go on for hours, but that's just a taste of it.  What are your thoughts on the gray zone and that type of journalism?  This is a great question.  It's something that I thought about making a video on, but... I don't know, not yet.  Maybe eventually when I get around to it.  I have a lot more topics that I want to do before that.  But I feel like the gray zone and other outlets like them are very much just contrarian journalism.  Like they will take whatever position is the opposite to the US government.  No matter what, they just have no limits.  They supported Assad, they denied basically every little thing that he did.  I've seen some of their journalists defending China and specifically Uyghur concentration camps on Twitter.  Their Venezuela reporting was incredibly dishonest.  Like, for example, there was one segment they filmed where Max Blumenfall, I believe, went to a subsidized market in Caracas.  And he's like, oh, look how cheap all these things are.  Look how cheap they are.  There's no crisis here.  There's no such thing as a crisis in Venezuela.  But, you know, he provided no context for those prices.  Like, how much money do people actually earn?  And most of the products, like something as simple as a bag of rice or a tube of toothpaste, costs more than what the average Venezuelan earns in a day.  So yeah, there's a big problem with the grey zone, I think.  There's a bit of an adventure journalism sort of element to it.  Like, you know, it's rich white guys going to countries with big problems and acting like everything is perfectly fine just because the USA is opposed to them.  Now, of course, you should be reading the mainstream media with a whole lot of skepticism, but the Grey Zone and other outlets like them are basically just the opposite extreme.  And because of that, they should be read with just as much skepticism as the mainstream media is.  That said, they definitely have done some actual good investigations, so credit to them for that.  Next question.  Are there any prominent similarities or differences between cultural attitudes towards indigenous peoples in Australia and Argentina?  Well, I do feel like there are a lot of differences in that.  mostly in Argentina, people just ignore the fact that indigenous people exist or existed Whereas in Australia, people tend to be a lot more openly racist against them And very often, it seems like some Australians love to hate Indigenous people, whereas in Argentina, if you asked most people about them, they would just be like, I don't know anything, sorry.  That said, on the occasions where Indigenous Argentines do sort of make the news, people get quite pissed off.  If someone is a Mapuche who's sort of white passing, they're gonna try and say that this guy is not a real Mapuche, even though, you know, who is some random white Argentine to judge?  They believe that to be Indigenous, you need to like literally like live in a hut in the jungle or something.  Whereas in Australia, you know, it's a lot more fluid.  Like people who are white passing and live in cities and stuff, no one with a brain is going to deny that they're indigenous.  But there are a lot of Australians with no brain.  But Argentina is definitely in the midst of a cultural shift where it's moving more towards the Americas and maybe a little bit more away from its more European sort of traditions.  So that's interesting.  Will be interesting to watch a special in the next 10, 20 years or so, how that changes things.  Favorite Argentine writer slash thinker.  I haven't read many Argentine authors, to be honest, but thinker, someone modern, Elizabeth Helene, a sociologist, look her up.  Great work on memory.  I'm actually going to be citing her in a future video of mine, so look out for that.  Next question, opinions on Rojava.  Well, I've read a bit about the democratic and federalist ideology of Abdullah \u00d6calan.  Apparently Turks don't like him, so if you're a Turk, I apologize.  And I understand that this is what they're implementing in Rojava, or at least what they're trying to implement.  And yeah, I don't know, it seems good to me, seems fine, very inclusive of women, stuff like that.  Much, much closer to socialism than most systems that are implemented around the world today.  So yeah, I definitely support them against basically everyone around them.  And I hope that they somehow manage to survive and prosper.  And the final question, probably the best one, thoughts on Stalin's USSR slash Mao's China.  Well, my thoughts are that things that Stalin and Mao did objectively improved the living standards of tens of millions of people, hundreds of millions of people, but they also committed terrible atrocities, made lots of mistakes that resulted in tons of people suffering and dying, and their models certainly are not anywhere near my ideals.  That said, both China and the USSR, especially in terms of their ability to provide their population with their material needs and a decent standard of living, were nowhere near as bad as that presented in Western propaganda, and that's something that we need to remember.  And also, there's the whole thing where Stalin's USSR basically defeated the Nazis single-handedly.  So yeah, there were certainly good things, and also some really, really bad things.  But overall, going forward, I hope that we learn from their mistakes rather than repeating them.  So yeah, I guess that's the Q&A done for now.  Thank you guys so much for supporting me.  I never thought that I would have 10k subscribers so fast, or 12,000 as it is now.  And just to let you guys know what I'm working on, I'm currently working on a response to Knowing Better's Columbus video, which was a terrible denialist whitewash, and I feel like it merits a response.  The script for that is finished.  It's 12,000 words.  It's going to be about a two-hour long video, maybe an hour and a half.  And I'm hoping that I can finish it before November 30th.  I haven't filmed it yet, so that's kind of going to be difficult.  But yeah, there's basically nowhere it's going to happen, so probably next week or the week after that.  Then after that, I'm going to do an Argentine history video slash film critique.  which I'm keeping on the download right now, very super secret.  Maybe you guys will like it, maybe not, we'll see.  Then yeah, I'm just gonna take the ideas and the desire to create as it comes and make whatever I want.  So yeah, that's it.  Thank you guys so much for all of your support.  I really value it so, so much.  And if you like my content and you have the money to burn, please consider supporting me on Patreon.  It really, really helps.  I couldn't survive without it right now.  There were a lot more questions in this, but I didn't really have a great answer to a lot of them, so sorry about that if I didn't get to your question.  It's not because I hate you, it's just because I didn't really know what to say.  So yeah, share my stuff around.  if you like it, tell your friends, whatever.  Bye guys!  Special thanks to my $10 plus patrons.  Thanks all.  Bye. ",
