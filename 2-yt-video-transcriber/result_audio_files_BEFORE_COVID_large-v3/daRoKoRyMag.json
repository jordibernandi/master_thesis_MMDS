            "text": "Hello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Bright.  Today on this episode of the Unboxing Authority, I am going to show you how to completely disable and if you want to remove Google Assistant, Google Search from your phone to where it won't work at all.  And then in the next video, I'm going to show you how to completely remove the search thing from your home screen and replace it with this home screen so that you don't ever have to deal with Google Search again if you don't want to.  Okay, so for the purposes of this tutorial, I have re-enabled OK Google and Search Google and all that on my phone.  As you see, the Google Assistant, as you can see, is working.  So we're using the stock everything on Android right now just to show you how to disable this.  If all you wanna do is disable this, okay, there's a few things you can do, but keep in mind that none of the stuff that they tell you in the normal tutorials works.  We're not gonna have to root the phone, we're not gonna have to do anything, but we're gonna completely disable this search bar if that's what you wanna do.  So I'm gonna show you how to do everything.  So first, we'll go ahead and say, let's go to Settings, and we're gonna go to our Google Settings.  Where they at?  Here we go.  And we're gonna find our Google Assistant.  There it is.  It's normally not in the list on my phone because I have it completely disabled.  I'll show you how to do that.  So we are going to want to go to Settings.  And it's mad because I'm not connected to the internet.  So hit Settings.  And now, all these settings are online, I found out.  They're not on your phone.  So we go over to the Assistant tab.  We scroll all the way down.  We see Phone.  Now, right now it says it's enabled.  We're gonna disable it.  This won't do anything, okay?  It's still gonna work.  So we'll get around all that.  So let's see, we're just gonna go back to home.  Sorry, I have different launchers installed.  So see how it says.  you can still say, okay, Google, disabled it but it's still working.  this is why we're doing this video.  so what we're going to do now is completely disabled that.  so it's no longer listening to us.  so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go to apps and I haven't found any other tutorial online that shows you how to do this just so you know.  so now we're going to go to Google and before we disable it we're going to go down to the permissions.  So permissions is right there.  We're going to turn off all permissions.  Oops, we have to hit deny anyway on each one I think.  And what this is going to do is it's going to disable Google Assistant from having any access to the microphone, GPS, SMS, anything in the phone in case somehow the app becomes alive again.  Now what we're going to do is we're going to force stop.  but we're gonna disable the app, okay?  And this is kinda cool.  So now that we forced stop and disabled the app, okay, here's what's gonna happen next. ",
