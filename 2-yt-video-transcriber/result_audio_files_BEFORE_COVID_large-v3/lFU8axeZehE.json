            "text": "The whole idea of us going back to see the slave castles we were sold from as if this is some journey home when in reality it's more of just seeing where people sold us from.  And I want to talk about it today and get real and get clear and get honest.  Let's talk.  So recently I was shown some pictures today of none other than Boyce Watkins all on Instagram showing himself in some kind of African gown talking about he meeting the King of Ghana and really just showing that he don't understand American history and he don't understand the history of the Transatlantic slave trade.  Just less than a few weeks ago, he was talking about how he wanted to be part of ADOS.  This shows why he's not anchored in lineage to the point where he understands none of that makes any sense.  So we see this thing, this narrative, where you're going to recreate the context of what really happened as if it was just some white... colonialists and they set up the slave castles and we were stolen from Africa when in reality this was a multi-hundred year institution that many many West Africans took part in.  I think we gotta get honest and you know the New Yorker came out with a piece about Nigerians and this is all up and down the west coast of Africa.  since this article my great-grandfather the Nigerian slave trader detailed one of the first times we saw it in a major magazine the reality of how intimate the slave experience was for West African slave traders.  This young woman talks about how her great-grandfather was buried with six slaves that were still alive as tribute.  This is not a long time ago.  How there was pride at the funeral from him being a slave trader.  I think none of this none of us really want to deal with the context of what really happened.  so now we're setting up this whole false narrative as if we're going home to people that we were stolen from versus people that sold us and we need to get real with it and talk about it.  so The other thing that we see with Boyce Watkins is you see this attempt to undermine and be slick and passive-aggressive about everything that's going on with ADOS.  You know, American Decision Slavery is essentially a movement demanding reparations and a black agenda focused on ADOS, but not just for ADOS, for black Americans.  But I think in a lot of ways, we've upset the apple cart, not only with the Democrats, not only with the NAACP, but also with black YouTube.  And in a sense, what you see is this attempt to redefine black empowerment in a way that is so fantastical that it re-anchors itself in fantasy that you can't see.  It's still just fantasy.  What do I mean?  So you see Boyce Watkins on a video talking about he getting land in Ghana.  You see Boyce Watkins in Ghana talking about he building trade relationships.  What are you talking about, brother?  You don't trade nothing.  You ain't trade nothing with no Ghana.  You see Boyce Watkins in Ghana trying to make slick statements about what we're doing here versus there to kind of elevate.  In contrast, without full context of what's going on, ADOS, American Decisions of Slavery, created a national discussion around reparations, has caused Democratic candidates to focus on and have to deal with black agenda items.  I know this for a fact.  So I don't know what Boyce is doing, but we doing politics.  You know, one of these things was.  one thing I'm reminded of during my most recent trip to Africa is that we don't have to sit around the U.S.  and complain about racism all day.  There's a great big world out there who loves us.  I don't think this man really understands that Africa is not a place.  Nor do I think he understands where he just visited.  But I'm going to say it straight.  You know, Reuters did an article, and I'm going to read some of it into the record.  One of the lines is, many rulers of West African empires, such as the Ashanti Kingdom, whose descendants still live in this part of modern day Ghana, also profited, selling captured slaves in exchange for guns, cloth, alcohol, and other Western manufactured goods.  So you don't know how likely it is that the tribe leader, that the businessman that you're meeting comes from a lineage of slave trading and now is masking that in tourism to get you to see the place that he sold your family from.  And you gonna dress in a gown that you would never wear here, that you were never raised on to make you feel empowered.  None of that makes sense from Boyce.  None of that makes sense from anyone else.  We saw the same thing from the Congressional Black Caucus.  They went there and dressed up in kente cloth.  Understand this is all while we're talking about a national reparations discussion here that they're trying to avoid.  The Black Caucus takes Pelosi down there, takes these pictures.  We don't need no pictures in Ghana.  We don't need nothing from Ghana but an apology and a piece in on reparations.  We don't need you in Afghanistan.  We need you here in the American ghettos that ADOS people are suffering in today.  I want to read part of an article from the CBC website.  This is the words of Karen Bass.  Karen Bass is the head of the CBC.  We absolutely accomplished what we set out to, said Congresswoman Karen Bass of a recent trip to Ghana with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and 13 members of the CBC Congressional Black Caucus.  One was to go back to the origins of slavery, but it was also to renew our ties with the nation of Ghana, dubbing it the year of return.  Well, the fundamental problem with all of this is that it doesn't deal with the fact, one, that we all don't come from Ghana, but more importantly too, these people largely were part of an institution of slavery that traded us into the transatlantic slave trade.  And number three, they're not talking about us becoming part of the actual infrastructure of Ghana, getting dual citizenship.  They're talking about us as tourists, whether people understand it or not.  I'm not here to talk about conjecture or ask them about dual citizenship.  Ask them about privilege and access.  Ask them about advantage in Ghana because they owe that to us.  Ask them about reparation.  See, those are the questions that need to be asked, not whether they can take us on a 10-day overpriced tour of some slave castles.  Now, I'm not faulting Boyce Lockins or the CBC for going over there, but I am faulting those people from a leadership standpoint of selling this to black folks that we know don't have the wealth to go over there.  The middle black family in America is worth $1,700.  Only a few percentile blacks even break a million dollars.  We know only 5% have more than $350,000.  So you'll have this boomer class of blacks that want to go back there and spend money that they should be saving saving for inheritance for the millennial children to go see the castles in Africa.  but none of this makes any sense because all it is is fantastical self-empowerment masked masking a legacy of slavery a legacy of repair that needs to be done here in America.  Adolf's here to do the politics though.  so I'm looking at this thing and I can't help but read some of this article called Ghana cashes in on slave heritage tourism.  In a clearing at the turn-off to Assen-Maso, a billboard depicts two African slaves in loincloths, their arms and legs in chains.  Beside them are the words, never again.  This is Slave River, where captured Ghanaians submitted to a final bath before being shipped across the Atlantic into slavery centuries ago.  never to return to the land of their birth.  Today, it is a place of somber homecoming for the descendants of those who spent their lives at someone else's property.  The popularity of the site has swelled this year.  400 years after the trade in Africans to the English colonies of America began, this month's anniversary of the first Africans to arrive in Virginia has caused a rush of interest in ancestral tourism, with people from the United States, the Caribbean, and Europe seeking their roots in West Africa.  Ten years ago, no one went to the Slave River, but this year has been massive, said Rossi Butler, who runs a company called Butler Tours.  She said business has nearly doubled this year, which has been touted as the year of return for the African.  The increase in tourism has been an economic boom for Ghana.  I have no idea.  how we got here.  I don't think everybody understands how crazy this is.  Over my shoulder is Ali.  Ali had a strong tie with parts of Africa, but understand this was a different era.  That was an era where we didn't have, where we had people standing up to capitalism, standing up to Western powers, We had a different Africa that was looking to change itself.  This Africa is looking to be part of capitalism.  This Africa includes major countries that are selling themselves to China and the U.S.  and the like.  But none of it deals with the fact that this Africa still didn't deal with reconciling its soul.  And I'm particularly talking about these West African countries.  For me, I'm looking at this thing, and I look at the Ghana, Caches, and Oslake heritage tourism, and it brings me to an analysis where I've got to start looking at this thing and say, are they hustling ADOS?  Are they hustling black folks in the Caribbean?  Are they just hustling?  And when I look at this thing, I can't help but see a hustle being formed.  So what do you mean, Tone?  What are you saying?  How are they hustling us?  You know Tone Breeze, you daddy, let's talk.  So when you look at this thing, some of the packages are like 10 day tours with eight nights of sleep because of the flight and everything else.  Understand that they'll have seven dinners in it and then essentially just give you buffet breakfast.  Now, the price point starts at $5,000, but most of them are ranging like $7,500.  Again, middle black family worth $1,700 together, when you take out depreciating assets.  Eight dollars liquid in Boston, a few hundred dollars liquid in  L.A.,  eleven dollars liquid in Miami, but we're going to spend $7,500 to go see the slaves' castles.  But okay, we're going to just leave that there.  So I looked at one of the sites to give you some context in it.  It's this site where it has.  the return of the African diaspora continues.  And what it says is book your trip for a 10 day tour for $4700 to start.  So we just gonna round it at a five, but that's the lowest trip.  It was eight nights.  This is the problem.  The problem is when you actually go and break this thing down, it's a hustle going on.  And I'm just going to call it like I see it.  Labadia Beach Hotel is what they were talking about.  They're going to give you eight nights at the Labadia Beach Hotel.  They're going to give you some tours and they're going to give you a flight.  Well, when you look at the Labadia Beach Hotels, it's $200 a night, oftentimes $170.  If you come in as a group, you probably can get it at $150 or even less.  Let's just use the highest price, the price for a single person getting a room, $200.  Well, eight nights is $1,600.  All right, so the room's $1,600.  Flights can be found round-tripped from the U.S.  to Ghana for $700.  So $700 plus $1,600, where we at?  $2,300?  How is it that you're charging me $5,000 for something that is $2,300?  Even if we add in $500 for tour, we're still at $2,800.  I don't understand how people that are supposed to be paying us reparations are charging us a $2,000, $3,000 premium to go see this place that our families were sold from.  This is what Boyce is part of.  This is what the CBC was trying to sell.  It is a giant tourism push.  It is not about dealing with the fact that we were enslaved, that we were sold into slavery, that we were buried alive as slaves, that our families were locked out, that our families were locked under, that our families were sent here to die.  For a lot of people this is hard to digest because I know for a long time you've built your identity out of an African you've never seen before.  But what I'm saying to you today is that your home is here.  Come be part of ADOS.  Come be part of American Decisions of Slavery.  You find us in front of the DNC at the debates.  You find us in front of the Supreme Court steps.  You find us doing politics so your son, your daughter, your grandma, your sister can have a better life here in America. ",
