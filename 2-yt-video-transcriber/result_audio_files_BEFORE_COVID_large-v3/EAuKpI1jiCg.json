It's the bypass BP51 system on here.  Has the bypass struts in the front and the bypass shocks in the rear.  New coils in the back as well.  Gives a real nice stable ride.  A lot of good write-ups on this particular system on here.  Customer really likes it.  Running some VF Goodrich KO2s, 275-60 R20s.  Give a nice stance on this vehicle.  It doesn't stick out too far on these particular rims, which is good for Hawaii.  Our laws over here are kind of funky in that respect.  It's also got some front and rear grill guard and a bumper protection in the back and some nice rock sliders in the side to protect the side as well.  Any questions or comments about this build or any other build, just get a hold of us.  We'll get back to you, and thanks for watching. ",
