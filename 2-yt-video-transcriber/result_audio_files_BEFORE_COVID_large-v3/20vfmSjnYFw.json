But before we jump right into today's train wreck of a video, I just want to briefly say that I have revamped my merch store to include clothes for fall and winter.  It is getting freezing, not really in  L.A.,  if I'm being honest.  Everything's kind of on fire here.  Heavenly Father, please help us.  But I know that where many of you guys are, it is freezing, and I realized I didn't really have any hoodies, so that has been fixed.  As always, the link is in the description to my merch store, and I love you guys so much for shopping at it.  But let's get right into the video.  So we're going to be talking about this very... interesting individual named Rachel McKinnon.  Rachel McKinnon is a trans woman, also an athlete, a cyclist.  So sports and trans people are always a very tricky topic, especially when you consider the fact that a lot of the sort of trans athletes we see in the headlines lately are literally all like 30, 40 years old, started hormones at 30, 40 years old, have Decades of male puberty and male hormones to set them at an advantage, you know for some reason it never seems like any trans athletes that actually transitioned young.  I Couldn't tell you why.  no, listen, I really don't know a lot about sports.  It's never really been my thing, but I am naturally just sort of innately an amazing athlete.  I know a lot of you guys were completely blown away by my Instagram video.  I recently put up and Thank you.  know that's just tuesday now.  rachel mckinnon recently crushed like just destroyed all the women in her competition which is the women's world championship for cycling honestly never heard of it.  you guys know i'm not the one to know anything about sports though not out there.  i mean whoever could have guessed someone who's biologically male would just destroy their female competition.  i mean could it be that there's a biological advantage?  Could it be that we're completely ignoring that biological advantage for the sake of being woke and completely disregarding the women who worked their entire lives to try to win a championship just to be beaten by this person?  Okay, glad we're on the same page.  Now, it wasn't enough for Rachel to completely shatter her competition.  She had to then gloat about it and say that the only people that have an issue with it are losers.  Very testosterone-y thing to say, if I'm being honest.  Here's Rachel being interviewed by Sky News. ",

You can see it in plain sight.  You can't deny it when you're looking at it.  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.  Okay, so just for curious purposes, I went to go to Rachel's Twitter and she has me blocked.  I have never interacted with this person, never spoken about this person and I'm blocked.  I think she knew what was coming.  I think she knew she was gonna make it onto my channel.

This person, again, just shattered records.  It's almost comedy how these trans women compete and they're not losing, not even second place, not third place, not mid-range.  They're all winning by far.  I'm sorry, but all you have to do is look at these people.  Does this look like someone who should compete against women?  Regardless of if you consider trans women women or men or something in between or whatever.  It's clear just by seeing it.  Are people going insane?  But on the real, like I said before, when it comes to trans athletes, they benefit from years of testosterone being in their body.  And yes, when you go on hormones, certain things do change.  Your body composition does change, absolutely.  I started getting way more fat in my hips and my legs and my upper body.  I did become weaker after going on hormones.  But there are certain things that are irreversible that are absolute advantages when it comes to sports.  Height, for example.  I naturally am kind of short.  I'm 5'5\", but from the looks of it, These people are not 5'5\".  Bone density, thickness, hand size, wrist size, arm size, all of that develops and then you can't reverse it.  It will always be an advantage.  Especially when it comes to deadlifting.  Like, are we just all going crazy?  Like, I... I don't understand how this isn't just obvious to people.  I really don't.  I can really only imagine the frustration of women competing against these trans women.  I mean, in a lot of the cases, it's just not even a close call in terms of fairness.  So I think we should all be invested in sort of regaining reality and perspective on this issue because it's really embarrassing personally for me as a trans person.  Just saying.  And it's actually not fair at all.  But that is it for this video, you guys.  Don't exit.  Because I'm going to remind you to hit the subscribe button if you haven't.  I know this is the second, third, fourth video you've watched of me and you haven't hit that button yet.  I would really appreciate it if you did.  Please do it.  And hit the bell.  Follow my socials because half the time YouTube will not notify you of a new upload unless you're following my Twitter and my Instagram.  Check out that new merch I mentioned early in the video and I will see you in the next one.  Bye guys!  Thank you. ",
