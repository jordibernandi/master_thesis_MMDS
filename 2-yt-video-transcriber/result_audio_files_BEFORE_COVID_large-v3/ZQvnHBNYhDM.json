It says, to liberate children from the traditional roles of boy and girl.  It's to amplify the discussion about a humanistic education which is gender-free.  She rolled out this new fashion line, and it's in conjunction with an Israeli fashion line, with this very bizarre ad.  She walks into a maternity ward, blows glitter around the room.  All the boys are in blue, the girls are in pink.  Not after she does her magic.  And then in one of the bassinets, this big voodoo doll appears.  It's a very strange line.  See it on the right hand side of your screen?  See it?  Ew.  OK.  Why is that enticing for a clothing?  Let me show you the bizarre fashions, OK?  These are gender neutral, but they're very dark.  There are skulls in the collection.  Why would you put babies in skulls?  I don't know.  Bones.  Planned Parenthood.  There's this all-seeing eye.  that's, you know, a big thing with... Is that kind of the Antifa child?  Secret group.  What was that?  Bizarre.  And this group, this NuNuNuNu, they have demonic designs with horn hoodies for kids.  I thought it was Halloween.  Very dark.  Look at this.  This is from their Instagram page.  That looks like something out of the Wizard of Oz when the lollipop kids... It's really sick.  Well... Celine Dion and the founders of this brand explained themselves in a CNN interview.  Watch this. ",

But they admitted what their goals are.  A new order.  They want a new order.  They want to affect the culture, change the way people... Her heart may go on.  Her sails are going to go the way of the Titanic.  Who are the helping hands organizations, Raymond, do you think?  Oh, this is a tease.  You're moving on.  I'm moving on from you.  Wait a minute.
