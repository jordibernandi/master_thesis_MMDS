I sent letters to each of you last week to learn more about how you make your money and what recourse tenants and taxpayers have if you fail to uphold your side of the bargain.  Your agreements are not transparent.  They're not publicly available, but basically you make your money in two ways, management fees and distributions based on performance.  So you all stressed in your written testimony that your management fee is partially based on resident satisfaction and quality of service.  So I just want to unpack this.  Mr.  Williams, I'll use you for the example.  Say there's mice and mold in all of your units and the tenants are unhappy.  Do you still get paid a base fee? ",

I look at your annual reports, and what I see is that all in, about 3% of the taxpayer-funded rent that you collect from service members goes straight into your pocket, even if the homes are disgusting.  And usually that number is closer to 5%.  So I just want to understand, I'll try to do this as quickly as I can, what that adds up to in dollars.  And I sent you a letter to ask you this, so I'm sure everyone has the number ready.
