            "text": "Some of you may not know who Nick Fuentes is.  Nick Fuentes is a \u2013 I'm not even going to say a crypto-Nazi because the crypto is gone.  He masks off all the way.  He is a full-on fascist who is a YouTuber.  He was originally a Twitch streamer, and that's why there's some history between Nick Fuentes.  There's some actual \u2013 Destiny's got a couple of debates with him, which, as Destiny is one to do, completely mops the floor with him, as Destiny does really well with anyone who's on the alt-right.  Uh, there's some conversations.  he's even on a couple of podcasts with, uh, Hassan and destiny and train wax.  I think he even has one with him.  Uh, regardless, Nick Fuentes is an absolute piece of shit.  And now he's been relegated to the platforms that will still have them.  Of course, those being D live, the streaming platform for libertarians and YouTube, the platform that seems to have a big problem with cleansing the Nazis within, uh, Also, Twitter.  Twitter seems to have a pretty big problem with that as well.  And if you're wondering, is that actually a problem on Twitter?  Well, for a very long time, Richard Spencer was a blue checkmark member, and Richard Spencer is still on the platform.  I mean, I don't know what Richard Spencer has to do to actually get to be recognized as, you know, the full-on white nationalist that he is.  But Nick Fuentes is on there too.  Nick Fuentes went from having, I think, something around 17,000 Twitter followers to an astounding 20,000 to now 70,000 Twitter followers.  And the big reason happens to be is that he has started a war with the right, particularly with Charlie Kirk.  Now, hold on.  I know what you're thinking.  And I'm with you.  I'm totally with you.  You'll love to see it.  In fact, it's been nothing but absolutely hilarious.  We've all seen the memes, right?  I'm sure anyone realized not too long ago that Donald Trump Jr.  has a book tour going on for his book, which is just so cleverly titled Triggered.  And what exactly happened at that event?  Sorry, that's going to be horrifically loud.  We're willing to listen.  We're willing to listen.  See what I mean?  And that is the problem.  And the reason oftentimes it doesn't make sense to do the Q&A is not because we're not willing to talk about the questions, because we do.  It's because people hijack it with nonsense looking to go for some sort of soundbite.  You have people spreading nonsense, spreading hate to try to take over that room.  No, it's because you're not making your parents proud by being rude and disruptive and discourteous.  We are happy to answer a question.  Respect the people around you so that they can hear.  Okay, pause it.  First thing to note here is can Turning Point USA not afford a microphone or a PA system or what exactly is going on here?  How did this happen?  Charlie Kirk, come on.  You spend so much money on cranial surgery that you can't even afford a decent microphone PA system for your platform.  I mean, that's just egregious.  But a lot of people are probably wondering who exactly is screaming and yelling at them.  I, at the time, thought it was probably, I don't know, Liberals or Not progressives, SOCDEMs, leftists, but no, this is the Nick Fuentes army who have been sent by Nick Fuentes to start yelling at what they consider not to be true Republicans.  They're not the true conservatives, after all.  The true conservatives are the ones who actually do not believe \u2013 in the Zionist conspiracy theory that we should actually be giving aid to Israel and other things like that.  And I'm not going to go too deep down that rabbit hole because I'm sure it's going to be TOSC all over the place.  But I will say this.  At the time, I was so excited because I was like, what?  Is this the alt-right fighting the right?  Can this possibly be true?  And sure enough, it was.  You don't play by the same rules.  Let me tell you something.  I bet you engage and go on online dating because you're impressing no one here to get a date in person. ",

            "text": "And, you know, I made a tongue-in-cheek tweet about this.  where it's like, you know, the left cannibalizes itself so often that I'm surprised we weren't reveling more in this because we're so used to it, right?  In fact, we probably just thought this was business as usual, you know.  It's just another Monday, you know.  But then things got worse.  They continued to progress, if you will.  Then this happened again out of Charlie Kirk, one of his other Turning Point USA things.  where he actually had a panel and he started talking about how Nick Fuentes is an alt-writer, how we shouldn't be enabling members of this ilk, shall we say, and that backfired as well.  A whole bunch of people started screaming at Charlie Kirk to the point that Charlie Kirk had to actually expand his cranium to the point that it became a balloon and he actually levitated out of that environment.  This is all true, 100% fact.  Now, Again, I was curious what exactly is going on.  Trump's son being harassed from the right seemed surprising, but the heckling represented a new height for a growing movement that's been seeded by Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist upstart who's been taking advantage of major tech platforms to gain prominence.  The increasingly prominent racist had been feuding with Charlie Kirk, Donald  Jr.'s  friend and a founder of Turning Point USA, an organization for young conservatives with chapters at colleges nationwide.  Now, I'm not one to really turn to Mother Jones, and here's one of the reasons.  There's a big journalistic error already happening at the start of this article, because if you're going to be talking about prominent racists, you should be still including people like Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA in that terminology.  But, you know, I digress.  But I hope he still doesn't have a blue checkmark.  Is that true?  Oh, I need to know.  I need to know.  Does he still have a blue checkmark?  If so, that is just going to depress me to no end.  Okay.  Two-parter.  First part.  What the fuck?  what the fuck Twitter?  What are you doing?  I didn't know I was blocked.  I didn't know I was blocked.  Wow.  Wow.  That's, this is, this is terrible news.  Great news.  Uh, thank you, Nick.  I've never interacted with you once.  I've never done anything even remotely related to you.  I, I've never tweeted at you.  I've never retweeted you.  I barely knew you existed up until like maybe three weeks ago.  So, uh, Ladies and gentlemen, guys, gals, and impals, we did it.  We did it.  I don't know how.  I mean, I can add him to my Mega Man collection of enemies.  He's one of the squares that we've been blocked by.  But wow, fantastic.  You know what?  If we're going to talk about Nick, we should probably do this with the right motif.  Give me a second here.  The fertility rates.  We need you to be making more beautiful white Christian babies.  Enough is enough.  You know what the problem is?  All the Muslims coming into Europe.  Quote, verbatim, Nick Fuentes.  Here's another.  For an introduction to Fuentes' political beliefs centered around Marxist infiltration.  So that's a term you may have heard.  It's similar to cultural Marxism, except it's a little bit more extreme.  But of course, if you want to talk about cultural Marxism, they usually go hand in hand when it comes to Jewish conspiracy theories.  So you will find some common ground in what we're about to talk about.  My timely birth in 1998 allowed me to watch on the nightly news.  the spoils of the American experiment squandered for one final time before the dying gasp of a once exceptional people as the free world and economic abundance of Ronald Reagan was inherited by the lizard people, the last soul in the last wave of the lost republic, a terror state, a cold war, a billion people saying that they own the ocean, more dollars in debt than atoms in the universe, Seth rogan boys are girls and girls are boys.  facts are racist feminism infanticide as the right so you know totally having a normal one.

When I was a young lad, when I was growing up, when I was your age.  you actually had to go on poll.  You actually had to go on R the Donald to get red-pilled.  It was a long and slow and gradual process where you started out with Milo Yiannopoulos, or you start out with Ben Shapiro, and you work your way up from Gavin, you get red-pilled on the woman question from Roosh, and you get red-pilled on everything else, and then you basically get an understanding.  You don't really even need that anymore.  If you're base Generation Z... you can kind of just look around and say, oh yeah, this is what's happening.  They hate us.  They're trying to replace us.  They're trying to make us gay women.  And that's basically the program.  Well, how did you get red-pilled?  Well, I walked outside today and I watched television or whatever, right? ",

            "text": "There's some things to pick apart here.  And I know this is going to be me throwing stones because at the time I'm recording this in a Dota 2 internet cafe in Peru and I'm illuminated entirely by the light that's coming off the screen right now.  So I probably look like a bit of a goblin myself.  But that being said, this is his actual professional set.  And I believe this was filmed during Halloween.  I mean, the only tip off is the pumpkin in the corner because they didn't even have the time or the effort to actually make it look like, okay, first off, the placement of the pumpkin, strange, awkward.  Why do you have it off into the corner?  You couldn't add anything else.  I mean, you couldn't add codwebs, plastic spiders, a single backdrop, maybe anything else to indicate.  I mean, I just don't understand.  Why would you do such a half measure?  Why would it be like, okay, we need to indicate somehow that this is the holiday, so we need to put a pumpkin in there.  Okay, fine.  Let's put it very, very awkwardly off into the corner.  It's not going to make any sense.  It's going to break up any kind of symmetry or cinematography that we're trying to achieve.  But sure, we'll have that off into the corner.  And then, yeah, business as usual.  His actual set \u2013 and anyone who has had the displeasure of watching his actual YouTube broadcasts will see that the whole thing is filmed in something like 18 frames per second.  It's very, very low budget.  But again \u2013 He's filling a gap and he's filling a very, very huge \u2013.  well, I mean this is a monstrous gap that has been left open by a whole bunch of different individuals.  We no longer have people like Milo Yiannopoulos.  We no longer have people who are basically speaking towards individuals looking for a combination of both white nationalism and red pilling simultaneously.  People who are going to be anti-feminist will at the same time talk to you about the problem that's occurring.  And again, Nick Fuentes, he would be a relatively small note, something that we would never have to talk about, but now is on the rise.  And he's on the rise both in the amount of YouTube subscribers and views that he's getting, the amount of money he's generating through super chats, the enormous explosion of fame that he's had on Twitter to the point that he's gotten a blue checkmark, which is still there, and over 70,000 subscribers.  And by the way, thanks for blocking us, Nick.  I had no idea we even knew each other.  But anyways, you watch any kind of video.  Let's say it's just Lego building blocks, all right?  So you want to watch a video on Lego blocks or Lego animations.  You do that, and then all of a sudden, the right side of your YouTube feed is filled up with a whole bunch of videos you have no interest in, or maybe you didn't think you had interest in, such as usually Jordan Peterson owning college campuses, Ben Shapiro owning college campuses, college campuses owning Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson while owning a college campus.  It's a giant cycle in a circle, and you're probably wondering why all this happens.  This has a lot to do with the algorithm, the algorithms and the way that YouTube works.  It also has to do with what is called the alternative influence network and how these individuals connect to one another.  So, We pointed this out.  Originally, we made a video on Joe Rogan.  We started with Joe Rogan.  So say you're a fan of Joe Rogan, and that's not a horrific thing in and of itself.  You start watching his show.  You watch some of the Joe Rogan experience.  You enjoy a couple of the episodes.  You might watch it because you're into the UFC.  You have no interest in politics, and you get introduced to a new character.  That would be Mr.  Dave Rubin because he has Dave Rubin on every now and then.  You watch Dave Rubin, and you're like, okay, I'm going to start watching Dave Rubin now.  So you've moved one step further.  You've gone from Joe Rogan to Dave Rubin.  Dave Rubin then has on Stefan Molyneux.  And you're like, okay, well, I've got this individual who's talking to Dave Rubin about the differences in brain weights between white and black individuals and how their brains actually weigh different.  They're different sizes.  That sounds a little strange, but okay.  He seems like he's got some kind of a performative theatrical element to him.  I'm interested.  I'm going to watch more Stephen Molyneux.  Then once you watch Stephen Molyneux, you're watching Jared Taylor.  And once you've watched Jared Taylor, unfortunately, you've gone too far.  Because once you're watching Jared Taylor, you're only a couple steps away from watching Richard Spencer.  And this is how this chart was basically a way of showing how they're all interconnected.  So Faraday Speaks was indoctrinated, if anyone doesn't already know this, he was indoctrinated into the alt-light.  Not the alt-right, but the alt-light.  So he went down the pipeline.  He started out by watching a whole bunch of different figures.  ones that were relatively benign, but he cites a few of them, one of them being Stephen Molyneux, and then Stephen Molyneux obviously introduced him to Jared Taylor, who then, of course, introduced him to a huge amount of people.  One of the most influential people he said to him was Lauren Southern, and what he believed Lauren Southern to be explaining to him, at least prophesying to him, he was also a little bit in love with her at the same time, but he thought Lauren Southern was completely right about the Great Replacement.  That is, of course, the conspiracy theory that white people are being bred out of existence.  Because of that, fairly speaks started to get fed information through this pipeline.  It got to the point where he was actually a full-blown alt-lighter.  And the only thing that took him out of it, well, it was twofold.  One was, of course, the New Zealand shooting, which was kind of the catalyst.  This was like the big come-to-Jesus moment for him.  This was the revelation moment for him.  But the biggest things that took him out of it were figures like Destiny, Vosh, and ContraPoints.  I mean, I guess I could have drawn ContraPoints, but I shouldn't have even attempted because I... I clearly have no artistic skill whatsoever when it comes to this.  So this is \u2013 I would not do the beauty of ContraPoints any justice.  But anyways, it was through speaking to people \u2013 well, actually, it was through watching people like Destiny and Vosh debate figures like Lauren Southern, for example, and absolutely eviscerating them.  And I know they're not real debates.  I know in the marketplace of ideas, these things aren't true.  But it was through that process that Faraday Speaks finally started to realize, wow, these ideas aren't real.  They don't hold up to scrutiny.  And that was really important.  Now, how can I demonstrate that through this graph?  I hadn't thought that far ahead.  I was hoping the visual medium would help everybody.  I mean, let's try.  YouTube goes into his brain like that.  But then Destiny did the talky talk.  And then that kind of did this.  And Vosh did the talky talk.  I kind of did that.  And then I got this here.  These did this thing through the science sphere.  Um... And thanks to that, it had the desired effect, which was to give him new phoenix wings.  And then that helped with the powers and increased the timeline pipeline, which then gave rise to the happies.  And then the most important thing we should be doing here.  It's science.  All right, wow.  Does everyone understand?  Does it make perfect sense?  Yeah.  I mean, I've never thought of this before, but I think I should probably be giving lectures at a university level. ",
