We have many guests on who cite the risk for the global monetary system, the fiat currency regime, and suggest to follow their lead and own precious metals in some way.  shape or form.  Listeners know that I personally have converted 24 months worth of living expenses into physical gold and silver.  Basically, I took my family unit's burn rate per month and just multiplied by 24 and converted that half into gold, half into silver in terms of the dollar amounts.  And I know that you advocate owning precious metals as well.  I wanna ask you though, what are your chief reasons for owning metals?  And do you have a strategy or routine for purchases that people can easily follow? ",

We point you to various literature out there in the market.  you know, my general view is this.  When you look at the historical performance of gold, and we talked earlier, we'll give your listeners a PowerPoint deck and a presentation.  I gave where I walk people through this.  You look at the historical performance of gold.  since year 2000, it's the second best performing asset class behind real estate.  You look at how it performs when in tough economical times, it tends to perform inversely to the equities markets.  And you look at it kind of, From a portfolio standpoint, you'd be silly not to have it in your portfolio.  To what degree you should own gold really depends on your circumstance.  Many analysts recommend 5% to 10%.  I've seen others with higher.  I've seen some with a little bit lower.  It really depends on your situation and your net worth.  And you say, well, gosh, the numbers are great.  They say you should own gold.  But what are the dynamics?  Some people want to buy gold only when they think, by the way, is the wrong way to approach gold.  You approach gold and silver as a long-term investment, not something you jive into and then get out of in three months.  It's just not the kind of equities.  It's not like equities.  It's not the kind of product that we're dealing with here.  But when you look at the landscape, you look at interest rates, you look at the value of the dollar, you look at the overvaluation of the equities market, it tends to say, and many analysts in what they're writing, tends to be a positive future for gold and silver right now.  for people to wanna get into.

I want to ask you, Ken, you are an expert on various products.  and storage solutions and anything else that has to do with the actual physical bullion industry if you if someone has never bought coins never bought bars or any of that what would be the first logical step or logical product to get introduced to?

            "text": "well look you know it's a great question.  you know you can own gold.  in our opinion you can go three ways you can own physical you can own it through etf or you can own digital.  We're the largest physical seller of precious metals in the U.S We do about a billion dollars a year, north of $10 billion in our lifetime sales.  We do over 500,000 orders a week.  I mean, excuse me, a week, I wish, a year.  And what we generally deal with is core volume.  So when I talk to individuals about what's the right product for them, I kind of walk through things like spreads and a spread.  is the difference between the premium you're paying for it and the premium you can get for it when you go to sell it.  And I think spreads are a way to really focus your attention to the right products.  What tends to silver to core bullion players are the sovereign coins, the gold eagles, the gold maples, or the silver eagles and silver maples, and then also core or bar products.  So one ounce gold bars are very popular as well as silver rounds and one ounce and 10 ounce silver bars.  Um, some people think, Hey, I need to go buy kilos or a hundred ounce silver bars.  And what I always advise people is it's not bad.  You get the lowest cost per ounce over spot, but you're going to pay for it a little bit on the back end.  Cause when you go to sell it, uh, those kinds of products don't sell at the same volume level.  So you take a little bit of a haircut on the back end when you go to sell it.  So I try to focus if I'm silver, 10 ounce, one ounce, uh, sovereign or bars.  on the gold side, I focus primarily on sovereign coins and a one ounce gold bar I think is, is the way to go. ",

            "text": "You know, it's a great question.  Obviously, we just had a Cyber Monday deal where we made any quantity pricing.  So you could you can come in with a thousand bucks and be like you have one hundred thousand bucks on our site, because what you tend to see is pricing gets better as you do more volume in our industry.  But not really.  When I look at it, it's really about the way the markets trend.  You tend to see metal prices trend upward and downward during certain times.  I think one of the things we tend to see is precious metal prices tend to decline in the summer months.  I'll always say September, October to be a good time to start to get into metal, me personally.  But I've also, I'm a big believer in buying metal as you go.  So dollar cost averaging and not trying to time the market.  It's just really, really hard to do.  So if you go in with a kind of mentality that I'm going to put in, you know, a certain dollar amount in the middle every week or every month, I think you're going to come out ahead long term with that approach and trying to time everything and trying to get the best deal.

And what are some of the options that people have?  you know, some people are afraid of confiscation, for example, in the U S or they just want some geographical diversification.  In other words, they're American, but they want to have some, uh, real estate offshore or banks accounts offshore, or just precious metals offshore.  Um, what are some of the good ones, the reputable, you know, talk a little bit about, uh, that angle of it. ",

            "text": "Yeah.  Look, we, we tend to focus on the U S market.  Uh, we store people's metal with Brinks, uh, today.  So we have a product called Citadel where you can buy your metal, buy your gold eagles, your silver maples, whatever.  And then we ship that product to a Brinks vault here in the US and we charge a storage fee.  That business does fairly well.  The majority of our business, you can imagine, is shipping to people's homes.  But for those that do want to store and don't want the risk of having metal in their home, I think storage is a great option.  I'm not a huge fan of moving metals offshore for a number of reasons.  Logistics cost is one of those.  And I also think the regulatory environment of the U.S.  tends to be more favorable to owners of precious metals than they are in other parts of the world.  And that can be debated, by the way.  I'm not the expert on Switzerland's policies and how they deal with storage.  What I can tell you is the expenses tend to be higher in other parts of the world.  I mean, we're actually working on a product right now where we're going to be able to sell physical metal in Switzerland.  And those storage expenses we're finding are 30, 40% higher than what I pay in the U.S.  as a byproduct of us trying to get that set up.  So there are companies out there that offer metal around the world.  And I welcome people to do the research.  We at Atmex generally focus here on storing it in the U.S.  today.  at least on the physical metal where you buy a specific product and you store it.  I'd like to take a quick moment.  We have launched a digital product.  It's called OneGold, O-N-E-G-O-L-D.com.  It's a very, very impressive product.  Today, it offers you the ability to hold your metal at the Royal Canadian Mint.  Or here in the  U.S.,  we're working on options in the U.K.  and Switzerland, as I just mentioned.  So there may be opportunities for those that want to hold their metal offshore and still have title.  Very important.  Still have title to the metal.  You can do that with our digital offering at OneGold.com. ",
