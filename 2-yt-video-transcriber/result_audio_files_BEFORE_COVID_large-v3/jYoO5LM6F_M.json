            "text": "good afternoon.  i'm karen hudis.  i'm the producer of this video which we're now doing instead of in dctv's offices because they're under construction.  instead we're shooting this in my home office.  i've got a backdrop which you may have seen in other videos and we're going to be talking about the series which I used to call the Network of Global Corporate Control, but that's a mouthful, so we're just going to call it the Black Nobility, since that is who's behind this network that we've been talking about.  And I'm delighted to be back with you.  You understand that the last video that we filmed live was on December 3rd, And after that, I was in the hospital.  And some of you picked up on the fact that I didn't sound so good.  I was going to do a patch so that you could compare the way I was to the way I am now.  But all you have to do is go back and look at the video on December 3rd and you'll see that I've largely recovered and this was a lot of hard work.  I was in the hospital for a couple of weeks and then I was in a rehab place and I've been tweeting about my experience there.  I'll tell you in a nutshell those people were totally corrupt and The people that rated them as number one rehab center, that was Newsweek, they're owned by the same people and that was not a number one rehab place at all.  They ended up stealing my telephone directory.  They stole all of my papers, including the paper that proved that they had forged my signature on the contract there.  Anyway, I was booted out of there, and what they did then, and I don't want to bore you, but it was personally very destructive.  They reported me as missing to the police, and then the police called me up that night, and I said, I'm not missing.  I'm perfectly fine.  And four hours after that, the police went and banged on my cousins' doors like Gestapo, which is what my cousins, how they experienced this.  So it was just totally outrageous.  They did that to alienate my cousins, but fortunately my cousins are wonderful people and they're more like brothers to me.  And so anyway, that's what I was doing in the last month instead of my videos.  But now you see I'm doing videos.  I'm doing them under private production.  And I wanted to make sure that the people that see my videos know that I'm fine.  Because some of them were very concerned.  I saw in the comments section that they were concerned.  So this is to update you.  And also, I just... very grateful for your prayers because they're very important to me and i i realize that it's because of the support that i'm getting that i'm able to carry on and it's very very meaningful.  i'm going to skip skip ahead a little bit to tell you that uh one of the things that i've learned is uh who we are were a lot different than most people think because all of the universities, the way their tenure system works is that any professor that's going to tell you what's true has not been given tenure.  They're all in cahoots.  with what I call the black nobility.  And most people don't realize just how duped they've been.  And fortunately, I've been doing this series now for almost five years, and there are enough of us who are working together to have changed the reality that we live under.  And the reason why I said we have to know who we are, we also have to know a little bit about what the real physics is because what's taught in the schools is just misleading.  The real physics is that once a group of people And we can't say exactly how many of us we have to be, but once a group of people understand that something is true, it becomes manifest in reality.  And this was actually learned by some Japanese scientists who, they call it the hundred monkey effect.  And that is that once enough monkeys understand something, and in the case of the Japanese scientists, it was washing sweet potatoes in the sea.  Once enough monkeys have reached critical mass, then the understanding, the knowledge, jumps over islands.  And the reason why that is, is because you don't realize how we think.  The way we think is that our brains are modems and we interact with a central processing unit that all of us are thinking with.  So the real work in the brains is going on in a different place.  And that's how the military have succeeded in hypnotizing many people because they're interfering with the transmissions.  They use supercomputers and the number of people that are hypnotized, it's usually 80%.  Fortunately, I'm not that sensitive to that.  It's called mind control technology.  I'm not that sensitive to it.  Although the way to make sure that you are not picked on is if you talk to two or three friends who know you very well and you can speak to probably thirty people before you find those two or three friends.  anyway if you talk to them and they know you very well they'll see when you're not acting yourself and they'll tell you about that and what you're going to realize.  it's very hard for people to understand when they're not themselves because for all practical purposes, they think that they're not hypnotized, whereas they really are using this mind control technology.  So the number of people that can operate the supercomputers that are harnessing this mind control technology is limited and they're not going to pick on people whose friends are telling them that they're not themselves.  They just don't want to waste their time.  So that's how you get your protection.  And enough of us understand this.  And although I'm... very frequently subjected to the mind control technology, I've gotten used to it.  I've gotten used to operating independently.  Although there are times that I'm susceptible, just like anybody else, and then people around me will let me know that I'm not acting myself.  And so that's what you need to do.  And once you've done that, there are enough of us that understand what the reality is.  We understand how we've been duped.  And once that happens, it's a game changer.  And all of the people who are thinking through that central processing unit their reality is different because it's become manifest.  And so this might sound a little bit extreme, but it's actually the case.  We are now in a different reality.  We're in a different reality because enough of us understand what the reality is.  What is the reality?  It's that we've been duped by the paper money system.  And that paper money system is really a huge scam because the central bankers who issue currency, they know that it's not real money.  Real money is gold and silver, and it's been that way for thousands of years.  And if you look at the earliest time when dollars were issued, in 1973, that's when we went off the gold standard.  now i'm not talking about the gold standard.  the gold standard is something which says you take your paper money and you then can go back and get gold.  well that's not what we're doing.  what we're going to do is we're going to take gold and we're going to press it very thin and we're going to put it in an envelope and the amount of gold in that envelope is going to be equivalent to the face amount of the bill.  This envelope is called Aurum and we've been in touch with a company that manufactures this and the technology is there.  So that's going to make it very difficult for the central bankers who do not have this gold.  We're the ones who have the gold.  And who's we?  Well, there's a great hero called Jose Rizal, He came from the Philippines.  His lawyer was Ferdinand Marcos and he rose up through the ranks in the Vatican and he became something called the Black Pope.  That's the superior general of the Jesuits and he was very powerful.  and at the end of World War II, He took the gold that had been hoarded in the Vatican and he shipped it off to Singapore and he stamped it and he put it in a trust for all of humanity.  He called that trust the proclamation and declaration of the gift of love.  And that gold was in a trust fund in the World Bank for 50 years.  And the reason why it was kept for 50 years is because there's something called the statute of limitations.  This is an ancient Roman concept.  And what it says is that after 50 years, if you have a claim and you haven't succeeded in proving your claim, it's fallen apart because there's no way that you can have good testimony about the reality.  Now, this is not just limited to a court.  And so what Ferdinand Marcos and Jose Rizal did was they put the world's wealth, it's not just gold, it's platinum, it's silver, it's precious metals, it's artworks.  They put all of these treasures, the world's wealth, in a trust fund and then they created the World Bank.  And the idea was after 50 years, we would then we meaning all of the people on this planet, we would then inherit this wealth.  Well, the 50 years passed, And now all of the crooks that are claiming that that gold is theirs, it's been 50 years, and they haven't succeeded in making their claim, so the claim is now falling apart.  And you'll see in correspondence that I've written and that I've posted on the social media, you'll see who some of these crooks were.  And you'll understand that after a while, I've just gotten very brusque with them.  And I said, look, this is an old claim and it's no longer valid.  So that's where we are.  This was done.  Fernando Marcos and Jose Rizal were geniuses.  This was done so that we would have this world's wealth Free and clear of any claims.  There could be no fighting over it because it's clear after 50 years.  this belongs to the trust.  And the trust, what's going to happen with the trust?  That's a very good question.  I'll tell you what's going to happen to the trust.  We are going to work together.  and we're going to eliminate the paper currency corruption because it's very easy to see how the bankers have been corrupting everybody.  Money is not paper.  And when the bankers print money, sometimes they just use it as an entry in a digital account.  When they print money, they get to keep the difference between the face amount of the bill and what it costs them.  In some cases, it costs them nothing.  So they're then taking this paper currency and they're buying real things with it.  That's corruption.  And then they're bribing people.  with that paper money.  Well, if the paper money is no longer valuable because people know that gold is the real money, their corruption falls away.  And all of the people who are depending on the central banks to bribe them. ",
