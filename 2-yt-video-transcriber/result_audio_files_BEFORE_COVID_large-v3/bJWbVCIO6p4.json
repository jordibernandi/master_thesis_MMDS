Chemical affinity is important.  It's an electrical transport.  Chemical affinity.  The body could only accept what it is made of, not something new or alien to it.  Last question.  Your Honor, is it a fact that the father of medicine, Mr.  Hippocrates, the man that established the principle of medical science today, cured every disease known to man?
