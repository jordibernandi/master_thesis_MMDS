They claimed to be on burglary patrol whatever that means.  judging by this it's where you accuse the first person you see of being a burglar.  When I was sent this video, I was the subject of it to complain.  He was fearful of doing so, lest the police try to extract revenge on him.  Given the aggressive and lawless way the police behave in this video, it's understandable.  I find it amazing that officers such as these pair, who clearly harbour a spiteful malice toward the public, are ever allowed to become police officers, let alone be promoted to sergeant.  they are the antipathy of everything the police code of ethics expects from their officers.  if you ever want to make a complaint against the police the code of ethics is a good place to start as any breach of its conditions are grounds for disciplinary action.  take for instance the behaviour of this woman who hounds this teenager into talking to them against his will.  i will act with self-control and tolerance treating members of the public and colleagues with respect and courtesy.  as we all know it's the police's job to enforce the law not act within it.  hence why this woman thinks she can ride her bike along the pavement while she harasses her victim or behave in a manner whether on or off duty which does not bring discredit on the police service or undermine public confidence in policing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where do you live then?  Not going to answer.  Right.  Don't feel like it.  Right, so that makes me think you've got something to hide then. ",

To add insult to injury, once the camera was switched off, these officers conducted a malicious search of this lad, something the police routinely do as a means to supplement their dented egos.  Well, I checked the level of crime in that particular street on the public database and I couldn't find a single instance of burglary there in 12 months.  I can only assume that they cycled away from the target area in case they met some proper burglars.  Which leads me to my next question.  Do you think the police treat genuine criminals with the contempt and disdain they treat this lad?  Not a bit of it.  To underscore that point, I've compiled a playlist on my account entitled Getting Away With It, which goes to show how afraid the police are of challenging genuine criminals and those who act like thugs toward them.
