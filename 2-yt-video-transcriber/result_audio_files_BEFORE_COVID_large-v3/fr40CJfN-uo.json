            "text": "Hey everybody, John the Editor here.  And I have two things to talk about today.  Two different articles, both of which are equally ridiculous.  One is talking about lowering the standards for female engineering students, and the other is talking about the backlash against the MeToo movement.  Let's talk about the engineering requirements first.  The University of Technology, Sydney, Australia, like many other tech schools, is trying to get more female students in their STEM programs.  And in order to accomplish this, they have lowered Or they've announced that they've lowered the entry requirements for female students, not for all students, just for female students, to try to pump up the entry class of female engineering students.  Now they call this anti-discrimination, although when you change the requirements and have different standards for two different groups, that sounds like discrimination to me.  Although I am not going to press on the point that this puts male and female students on an uneven playing field when they're competing for seats in an engineering program.  Life isn't fair and you can go cry in your ramen bowl if you don't like it.  I think there's a deeper and more long-reaching consequence here, and that is that If you lower the standards for female students to get into an engineering program, and you keep the standards where they are for male students, you're basically creating a school that produces two different qualities of graduating engineers.  Now, one of the things that the director of IT for this school says is, quote, we are not taking in under-performance students or doing tokenism here.  Well, that's wrong.  That's in fact precisely and exactly what they're doing.  But she goes on to say that nobody's getting a free pass, they all have to do the degree requirements and the internships.  Okay, well maybe once in the program they all have to compete on an even playing field, but does anybody really think that that's going to hold true if we looked more closely at this?  No, no.  And even if they do in fact compete within this program on an even playing field, companies hiring the students out of this particular school aerospace companies engineering firms infrastructure companies that that need engineers they're going to see this differential entry requirement for female and male engineering students and they're going to analyze that and quite correctly guess that the male students are a better quality of student.  and what follows is the graduating male engineers are superior engineers not because male engineers are superior to females but because you created two different filters and one filters out only the best that get in and one filters out a lesser quality.  you know filter sorry filters in a lesser quality of student.  That means that companies are going to want to hire male students more than female students out of this school, which is going to influence their salaries, which is going to just be more and more fuel for the endless whining of female oppressing inequality.  So I don't think this does anybody any favors.  It certainly does these female students no favors whatsoever.  It creates, if there was ever a perception that women were getting in on a token system not based on merit, and graduating from an engineering school based on tokenism rather than based on merit, well, now we have actual, tactile, measurable, obvious proof that that is happening.  and companies hiring engineers are going to want to hire male engineers more than female ones, and that's going to be reflected in their salaries.  Yeah, great for women.  Yeah, that's sarcasm, by the way.  Now, the second thing I want to talk about is there's another article in The Guardian, again, more ridiculous nonsense, about supposed backlash to the Me Too movement.  Now, I'm not going to read very much of this article.  I'm just going to read you a couple of the headlines.  Men now avoiding women at work, another sign we are being punished for MeToo.  Punished.  This is beyond absurd.  And this is written by someone named Arwa Madawi.  And, I mean, she doesn't look like an idiot, but she sort of writes an article like she's an idiot.  And I have to wonder, backlash against the MeToo movement.  That's the theme here.  Does this author, and presumably her editor and her publisher at The Guardian, are they really this level of idiot ding-dong, or is this trolling?  Like, are these the two choices?  That this woman actually, and her editor, and her publisher, that they all completely fail to understand the purpose of the Mike Pence rule, or however you want to call it, Or are they writing this article knowing that they're lying as a kind of a troll, as a goad, as a public taunt?  I can't tell.  But it occurred to me that there's a third possibility.  Now one of the subheadings says, a new study has found that United States men appear to be following Mike Pence's lead.  Maybe they're angry that Me Too ever happened.  It's yet another form of victim blaming, another way to quietly put women back in their place.  The ridiculous absurdity here boggles my mind.  It's jaw-dropping.  And I feel like I have to explain something that should be obvious to everybody.  Even ridiculous ding-dongs should understand this.  But apparently I have to explain this.  So if all of this is super obvious and boring, I apologize.  You're free to turn this off.  What the hell is going on here?  Now before I try to explain what I think is going on, I'm going to have to tell a little story to provide context.  And this is something that happened to me when I was in elementary school.  I was like eight or nine years old, or possibly ten, but I think nine.  And I was very young.  A boy in one of my classes who was a bit of an outcast, a bit of an outsider to our circle of friends, had been accused by a handful of the popular girls in our class of some kind of misbehavior.  Nothing like criminal or anything serious.  It was like child misbehavior, like he called some girl a mean name or he... pushed some girl or done something to invoke the wrath of the popular girls.  Now, whether he had done this or not was never clear to anybody, and it seemed that the story was a bit kind of hinky.  It seemed questionable.  And the result was that the popular boys in the circle of friends that I was in were and we're targeting this kid.  they were the at the at the elementary school that i was going to.  this kid was marked for a beating.  he was going to have a group of boys bigger more athletic popular boys corner him somewhere and lady age nine level beating on him.  now i knew that this sort of a a gang up and being happened with relative frequency because i've been uh... targeted for something like this before night taking my lumps.  I knew this wasn't just rumor, it wasn't just talk.  Something was going to happen to this kid at the hands of a group of male white knight popular boys at the behest of an accusation from one or a handful of girls.  And what the kid had done to do this was never actually, I don't actually remember what it was, and it wasn't clear to me that it was a real accusation.  So I was having a conversation with a boy in my class, the same age as me, but he was one of the big athletic kids.  And I said to him, what if Chris, I think it was a Chris who was being targeted, what if Chris didn't do it?  Like, what if the accusation is false?  And I can't remember the precise wording of how I asked this, but you get the idea.  And the answer I got from this bigger, more popular kid was, doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter if the accusation is false.  It was not a material fact whether the accusation was real.  That was just, like, he didn't have to think about it.  It just came back right away, doesn't matter.  And there's a reason I'm telling this story.  That's how justice has worked all over the world before we had a court system.  The role of the court system in Western civilization is so that vigilante retributive violence is not how human beings resolve their differences and their grievances.  We, when we have a serious offense, a serious grievance, we in Western civilization have devised this social and legal custom that we go through this formalized process called the courts.  which weigh evidence, which look at testimony, which look at all kinds of stuff.  We have forensics, we have DNA, we have video camera surveillance, we have judges that weigh your evidence, we have an adversarial legal system where you have a legal defense team and a prosecutor.  And this cumbersome, difficult, slow-moving system, which very often doesn't provide a result that anybody is very happy with and beats everybody up who goes through it, This serves the purpose in our culture so that when there is a grievance, it is not resolved through vigilante action, retributive violence or retributive killing, which can then spiral into tit-for-tat that goes on for generations.  And I've seen the tit-for-tat happening for generations in places where we don't have a culture of an established, entrenched legal system.  Tribal wars.  involving the killing of entire villages by other villages over ancestral grievances.  like somebody's great-great-grandfather stole some goats from somebody else and a few people are killed each weekend in a war that lasts for three generations in places like Papua New Guinea.  It's really bad.  Western civilization found a way to not have that happen.  And the way we have is the courts, which is cumbersome and slow-moving and expensive, and nobody is very satisfied by the courts.  But the reason we have it is to prevent the social need for vigilante dealing with grievance.  Now, what the MeToo movement has done effectively is get rid of the courts.  We have gone back to a vigilante system of justice.  Grievances, particularly sexual grievances, whether they are real or not, many of them are not real.  I've said before that MeToo is a false accusation movement.  It certainly facilitates and enables false accusations.  although some of the accusations may or may not be true we don't know because we don't weigh evidence anymore.  we now deal with it through vigilante action through social media and in some cases vigilante action in person so having no longer since we no longer have that trust in our society that a serious grievance is going to go through this slow, deliberate, methodological, and evidence-based procedure that we call the courts, we've gone back to the vigilante way of doing things, we no longer have trust between social classes, particularly men and women.  If there's a grievance, we don't trust anymore that it will be resolved through evidence.  Which means that you're not safe.  If there's an accusation, you're going to be targeted for vigilante justice.  Whether it's the form of a beating, as in the story that happened that I told you about when I was in elementary school.  That was a vigilante beating that that kid probably got.  I don't know if the beating ever took place.  I know that beatings like that did take place because some of them landed on me.  But we no longer have faith in our court system that that's where our grievances are going to be resolved with evidence.  So innocence is actually no defense anymore.  That's why men are following the Mike Pence rule.  It's not punishment against women.  Women or feminists... through the MeToo movement have got rid of the mechanism that allows us to trust each other, that allows us to cooperate and to resolve grievances in a formal, non-violent way.  That is no longer there, which means that the basis for social cooperation between men and women is also gone.  I don't know if I can explain it any better than this without being long-winded and amazingly repetitive and boring.  So to the writer of that article claiming that this is putting women back in their place, how absurd.  No.  The Mike Pence rule is men now following the rules of conduct of society as those rules are laid down by the MeToo movement.  It is not rejection of MeToo.  It is exact conformity.  It is precise conformity.  Mike Pence's rule, practiced in all its variations, is precisely conforming to the rules of society as they have been changed successfully by the MeToo movement.  I hope that makes sense.  I hope the feminists get it.  I don't want to have to explain this again.  Anyway, thanks very much for listening, and as always, have a lovely, lovely day. ",
