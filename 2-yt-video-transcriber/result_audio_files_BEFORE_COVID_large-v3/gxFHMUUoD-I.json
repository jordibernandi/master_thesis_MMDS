            "text": "I did not know who Owen Benjamin was until just a few weeks ago.  Someone commented on a video of mine on YouTube where I was debunking some myths about the Talmud and said, you should interact with Owen Benjamin.  Then I found out how well known he was, how big he was on YouTube, found out a bit more about his background, which made it all the more distressing to see him drinking this anti-Semitic Jew-hating Kool-Aid.  You know, the idea that the Jews own all the gold and the Jews own everything.  You ever see Fiddler on the Roof?  Do you know how much of Jewish history has been marked by extreme poverty and suffering?  Do you know how many times in Jewish history that Jews have been confined to ghettos by Muslims and professing Christians?  Do you know how many countries from which Jews have been expelled?  You learn history in America.  in 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.  If you learn it in a Jewish context, you learn that all non-baptized Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492.  And that's one of dozens of places, countries, locations from which Jews have been expelled over the ages.  Do you know that over 20% of Israelis live under the poverty line today.  So this idea, Jews own all, Jews control everything, they own all the money, it's just another anti-Semitic libel.  But Owen Benjamin has become completely unhinged.  Just listen to some of what he's saying now about the Jewish people. ",

            "text": "People forget that the Jews killed Jesus and then they burned down their own temple.  Modern Judaism started almost 100 years after Christianity, after the death of Christ.  That's a fact because they were defined by the rejection of Christ.  So, you know, there's that.  There's Hebrews.  There was like the Jews that didn't accept.  Christ started a whole new thing.  That was what that is.  It's an absolutely new religion.  It's younger than Christianity.  They killed him.  In the Talmud, they brag about it.  People are like, oh, no.  Oh, and if you think that they have to tell the truth, you have to understand that in the Talmud, the Jews say, let me quote it, Jews may use lies to circumvent a Gentile.  That's in Baba Kama, 113a.  So when people say, yeah, but the Jews said that they're not excited about the killing christ there's literally parts of the talmud where they're like yeah he's in a lake of fire that they they're like oh no he's the product of pantera who raped mary a roman soldier and they call mary a whore.  that's in the talmud.  ben shapiro's like oh the talmud's great.  it's great great book real jewy it's awesome guys it's.  and i'll dude i'll flip i'll flip in their little coin counting tables.  so you're supposed to do.  jesus gave us a blueprint.  flip the you flip it you're probably.  oh jesus was a pacifist that he was flipping tables being like you can count your coins now jews fact fact.

            "text": "i want to encourage prager you Dave Rubin, Steven Crowder, those who've worked with Owen Benjamin in the past, you may be trying to reach out to him privately.  You may be concerned about his mental or emotional state, but I want to encourage you to publicly separate yourselves from his comments.  and to denounce what he's saying in the clearest possible terms, because this stuff gets very dangerous.  This type of rhetoric, especially with him saying, well, Jesus flipped the money table.  So yeah, in other words, you get violent.  Get violent against people.  Get violent against these Jews.  That's what he is espousing, and that's what we must warn people against.  The audacity of Owen Benjamin.  quoting the New Testament or referring to the New Testament, he said, well, the Jews killed Jesus.  Well, what's God's perspective, first and foremost, that God loved the world so much he gave his one and only Son?  God gave his son to die for our sins.  Jesus said, no one takes my life.  I lay it down freely.  And the Jewish nation was hailing Jesus as Messiah when Jewish leaders, and some corrupt ones in particular, turned him over to the Romans to be crucified.  So yes, Jewish leaders were complicit in the death of Jesus.  That's true.  And yes, the Romans crucified him, that's true.  But more importantly, he died for all of our sins to try to incite hatred against the Jews as guilty of deicide, killing God, the Jews killed Jesus.  That has been done to cause the bloodshed of hundreds of thousands, if not millions and millions of Jews in Jewish history.  And those kinds of lies prepared the soil out of which the Holocaust was birthed in Europe.  That's reality.  As for the Talmud, listen, I am a Jewish follower of Jesus.  I am not a traditional Jew.  I am not a Talmudic Jew.  I take issue with Talmudic authority.  I take issue with aspects of Talmudic logic and reasoning that to me would go against hearing the voice of God and be open to the truths of the New Testament.  So I am not a traditional Jew defending the Talmud, but I hate lies.  I hate misinformation.  So tell you what, the Talmud is accessible online.  There are websites where you can read and study it yourself.  Go and read Bava Kama 113a.  Just go and study it.  First thing, you won't even understand what it's talking about.  It's primarily laws and traditions, millions of words, very, very difficult to follow and understand.  But don't think that it's just saying, oh yeah, Jews are allowed to lie to Gentiles all the time.  Go ahead and study the text for yourself and see what you find out.  You know, I was reading one text where it said, look, do you know that it's in the Talmud that if you have sex with a girl before she's three, it's nothing?  Did you know that?  No, that's not what the Talmud said.  The Talmud is talking about whether a girl who was sexually abused before she was three years old should still be considered a virgin when she gets married.  And the Talmud said, yes, she should.  In other words, this was nothing she was responsible for.  It's not a sexual act she participated in or anything like that.  She should still be considered a virgin.  This is something that happened to her.  It should be looked at as something evil and terrible, but accidental in her regard.  No, it's not sanctioning having sex with kids three years old and younger, but that's what people do with the Talmud.  And look, there is Jewish responsibility for rejecting Jesus, and the New Testament authors are plain about that, and I'm plain about it, and I say it's a terrible sin we committed, and I call on our people to turn from it.  But the fact is, through history, it's been the professing church that has sinned against Jewish people.  Look, why do you think some of these harsh statements, and they're very few in the midst of millions of words, very few.  Why do you think some of these harsh statements are there?  Why do you think there's a backhanded reference to Jesus burning in hell or Mary being a harlot?  If you reject the idea that she conceived virginally and her husband wasn't with her, then you're going to say she was immoral.  And followers of Jesus say those who reject Jesus will burn in hell.  So you have Jews who were persecuted by Christians and maligned by Christians and expelled by Christians, and they came up with their own junk in response.  It's bad.  But the idea that the Talmud is this anti-Christian, you study the volumes, Christianity is not an issue in it.  It's not a focus on it.  It's about Jewish law, Jewish tradition.  And in the midst of it, a lot of beauty, a lot of wisdom, a lot of amazing stories and edifying tales as well.  The idea that Judaism is a new religion invented after Christianity, and it is defined by rejecting Jesus, The ones that are the founders of what we would call Judaism today, the rabbis, they are the heirs of the Pharisees.  And the Pharisees have their roots to 100, 200 years before the time of Jesus as they were developing their traditions and synagogues and things like that.  And as they developed and as they grew, that became what we know as traditional Judaism today.  The idea that Judaism is primarily based on rejecting Jesus that Judaism is primarily defined by rejecting Jesus is a complete misunderstanding of the Jewish faith.  So look, maybe, Owen Benjamin, maybe you'll watch this video.  Here I am, a Jewish follower of Jesus, a man often rejected by my own people, a man who rejects Talmudic authority and rejects the authority of the rabbis in rejecting Jesus as Messiah.  And I'm telling you, you're wrong.  I'm telling you, you've drunk the anti-Semitic Kool-Aid.  I'm telling you, you're spreading things today that are going to result in hatred and that could result in even more and worse than that.  And I don't know what caused you to espouse these views, what happened.  I mean, the... I don't know what you'll be saying next, but, you know, stuff, you know, blaming Israel or Zionists and connecting them to every evil in the world today.  I've seen some quotes that are really terribly disturbing.  And the fact is, anti-Semites through the ages have drunk the same Kool-Aid and believed the same lies.  And now it's being spread on the Internet and others are drinking the Kool-Aid and believing it's nonsense.  It's false.  Bottom line, Jews are like everybody else.  A lot of good qualities, a lot of bad qualities.  And because of some of our history and God's hand on our lives, we can be very influential for good or bad.  But that's the reality.  And if you'll study the Talmud, if you'll take the time to learn and study Talmud, you'll find that 99.9% of all the lies and junk said about it are just that, lies and junk.  So you want to follow the example of Jesus.  Let's follow truth.  Let's follow love your neighbor as yourself.  And let us not participate in spreading lies against the Jewish people.  I say this not so much as a lover of Israel, but as a lover of truth.  And once more, once more, I encourage you.  encourage you, if you've been a follower of Owen Benjamin, step back and say, I denounce the hatred that he is espousing.  And let's pray for him, because something is wrong. ",
