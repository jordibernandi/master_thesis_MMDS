            "text": "She's still back.  They're not going to address it there either.  When you get sentenced to date, I can file a motion to get it addressed.  Okay?  So just remind me to file that motion, and then we'll go before the judge that he gets sentenced to, and then he's going to determine that they take it off.  Okay?  Yes, I'm right here.  So when we go on this date, we're going to be given a new date for our judge.  Then I can file a motion.  And the judge will decide if he's going to take it.  I'll see you.  Don't worry.  So we have one of two judges.  You're a clown.  Right there, bitch.  That judge is going to ultimately decide if you can get it off him.  Public servant.  Public servant, shut your mouth.  Out of your oath.  Out of your oath.  Either one of you guys got a complaint, go downstairs your father.  I don't need your crap.  Leave out.  Go father.  Go father.  Go father.  What are you yelling for?  What are you yelling for?  What are you yelling for?  Look at your gun.  Look at your gun.  Look at your gun, buddy.  I haven't got you on camera assaulting people.  Salt.  Spitting on people.  Spitting on people.  Spitting on people.  Get out of here.  Mr.  Clifton.  You probably want to recant that statement.  You want to recant that statement?  Public service.  Public service.  Fucking pigs.  Black mass oppressing civil rights?  Shame on you.  Martin Luther King will punch his face.  Martin Luther King is ashamed of you, sir.  Martin Luther King is ashamed of you, sir.  Okay, time out.  Martin Luther King is ashamed of you, sir.  Martin Luther King is ashamed of you.  Yes, boss.  Yes, boss.  Yes, boss.  Right away, boss.  Right away, boss.  Right away, boss.  Go ahead and sit, boss.  I'm the boss.  The response by one of the janitors was,  Mr.,  you're a public servant.  Please know your role.  And so he didn't mind that.  He told, get out.  And it escalated further.  Mr.  Clifton came out to the board.  You're dismissed.  As you were, Marshal, as you were.  And he goes, it's on the radio, and he goes, called in the alert for an officer being assaulted.  That's not true.  He just lied on the audio.  There's seven or ten witnesses here that, unless Marshal Clifton was in fear for his life, where there's no need for him to be in fear, he was not battered, nor was he in any position to be assaulted.  What had happened was he had conduct of becoming of a Marshal.  He's violating the policy and procedure that's related to him.  I take offense to that, man.  Yeah.  I have mental problems, bro.  Yo, you're in trouble for that one, dude.  Hey, back up.  Back up.  I'm not backing up.  You're backing up.  You guys back up.  Don't push me.  Don't push me.  Yo, boys, take that blue light flag off your shirt.  Hey, what flag does that represent?  You said retarded, man.  What flag does that represent?  That doesn't represent America.  Hey, dude, you calling people retarded, man?  Yo, that is not an American flag, Wilson.  Hey, your partner right here just called him retarded, bro.  Your partner right here just called him retarded.  This guy is calling people retarded, dude?  Yeah, we got this guy right here calling people retarded.  This is a business?  This is a courthouse?  You're adults?  Act like adults.  You're retarded.  Fuck you.  You should definitely put a complaint into that.  You call somebody retarded, that is an assault.  That is definitely not a... Yes, calling somebody retarded is a hate crime, actually.  Well, you're right.  Calling him retarded, man.  Wow.  carry a knife unless it was secured.  Because that thing is the most deadly thing you have on you.  You have a level three holster on your firearm, but you don't have a level three holster on your knife.  That knife will kill you quicker than anything else you have on you.  So unless you use that knife on a daily basis, stop carrying it.  Unless your intention is to have a throw down device, if you cut cheese, wood, rope, or anything like that, if your agency wants you to have a knife, put it on a holster.  So don't carry that, man.  That's bad news to have a knife on you.  Because in cases I investigate about use of force and somehow a knife comes up, How come the only person's DNA on the knife is the officer's?  It's always a question.  So do you guys want to follow?  Yes, those individuals want to follow.  Let's go down.  Can we go down to the lobby?  Absolutely.  He's appearing now, the actual guy with the legitimate complaint against that marshal.  He's currently appearing right now.  I'm the one that started this.  I don't know what to think.  He just asked a question.  See that sign right there?  How come that guy gets the two gum in there?  That would be a question for their supervisor, sir.  I'm not his supervisor, so I can't answer that question for you.  All I can do is just try and settle down this scene a little bit and then get you guys somewhere where you can make that complaint, and hopefully somebody can answer that question for you.  I'm not going to answer a question.  and give you the wrong information, right?  Because then that makes me a liar.  So I'm not going to lie to you and tell you, well, it's this or it's that.  I appreciate that.  I think that you guys only apply the rules to us, and you don't really give a shit about what's happening.  No, I'm going to say he's actually doing his part.  He's actually giving us an avenue complaint.  So he's identified that he has no supervising capacity over that individual.  He's now identified the avenue that we can go up the chain of command.  So we're going to go up the chain of command.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  This display that we had here after a core form was given, they continue to respond and attempt to escalate.  Those are bad news.  Yeah.  That's why they're here and not on the street.  I work for the judicial district court, which means that we have the security.  I'm telling you, Roger's some suckers today, right?  We didn't do anything to threaten security.  No, sir.  They expressed their concern.  I'm not... Like I said, I'm here just to try and see what I can do to resolve the situation.  You gentlemen have a complaint you want to make?  Yes, sir.  I'm going to help you do that.  My name is Sergeant Mark Vogel.  Yeah, absolutely.  You've got to identify all those marshals that responded and acted.  the way they did that one that called phil retarded.  yeah this is retarded.  no he said you're retarded And there's people that want to do a good job.  And there's people who look the other way.  These guys are looking for the guys who want to do it.  Thank you.  I'm ashamed of you.  I'm not even happy about it.  He's like, get out.  You got it on video, right?  Hey guys, so Yo, there ain't no punks inside this building today.  They thought they were just gonna freaking run up on us and do whatever they felt like doing.  It wasn't gonna happen like that today.  We'll stand our ground.  100%.  I got all of it, bro.  I got all of it.  He's talking to you like this and he goes, get outside.  How dare you don't sleep with me?  You shouldn't know that.  You got a knife.  You got a knife, sir.  You threw me out because after you told me about the gum, I said, I mean, it's just, I'm the boss.  I was like, you might exactly need something.  And I was like, no.  Yeah.  I guess we should all... Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Felipe.  Felipe.  Oh, yeah.  Unless there's a mutual agreement or a memorandum of understanding.  Sometimes I have vocal claims.  It depends.  I'm not aware of that.  Face to face with that dude.  Yeah, he was coming up for me.  No.  He's going to be calling for me, baby.  He's already called for me.  I don't know. ",
