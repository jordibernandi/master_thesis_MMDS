            "text": "So let's go to the Green New Deal.  We have a new person running for president.  Her name is Senator Amy Klobuchar.  And Ms.  Klobuchar is down with the New Deal.  She says it's a bold plan and she's going to get on board.  I don't know much about her.  She's a very liberal woman.  Al Franken's friend in Minnesota before he got booted.  Doesn't have a chance.  But remember, you know, these people can get famous.  They're all the campaign money that if you donate to them, they get to keep it.  Even if they drop out, they can write a book.  They can do speeches.  So there's upside.  Elizabeth Warren, she's a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal.  Cory Booker's another co-sponsor.  Kirsten Gillibrand, another senator from New York, co-sponsor of the Green New Deal.  On and on and on and on.  They're all... on board with the Green New Deal.  So I don't want to get into the specifics because your head will blow up.  But what this is, is a giant power grab for the federal government.  All right.  So I wrote the message of the day.  And this is why Joe Biden hasn't declared yet.  He knows this is insane.  He was vice president for eight years and then a senator for decades before that.  He knows that if you guarantee everybody a job, federal job, not private job, federal job, you give everybody a free college education, you change the entire economy, into a green situation, fossil fuels are gone, all right?  If you take private property to pay for this, remember we have a $23 trillion debt, and to do all the Green New Deal stuff, another $50 trillion, all right?  So you can't collapse the whole economy right away.  So Biden knows that.  But if Biden came out against the Green New Deal, he would be lynched by the Twitter mob.  So he can't.  So he didn't say anything.  But if he declares his candidacy, then the first question is going to be, do you like the Green New Deal?  So read the message of the day.  But what this is all about is allowing the federal government to run everything.  To run the economy, because corporations would be taxed to here and they'd all move overseas.  Wealthy people would move overseas.  I certainly would.  If there was a Green New Deal here and they're going to take my stuff, my assets, I'm gone.  All right?  I'll go to Ireland or the Bahamas or someplace.  I'm gone.  Okay?  And I'm not alone.  I have a lot of company in Dublin.  A lot of people there.  Okay, so the government will run the economy.  The government will run the health care system.  You say goodbye to your doctor.  Bye, Dr.  Welby.  Thanks for stopping by.  He's gone.  The government is going to tell you what services you can and can't get.  And if you need an operation, you're going to get on a long line like they do in Canada.  A long line.  It's going to take a while.  And then the government is going to tell you, well, this is a surgeon.  And the surgeon can do this, but he can't do that.  So economy, okay, healthcare, education, okay, it's free, but the government's going to then say, who teaches?  We got O'Reilly in there.  He's not teaching.  We're not giving him a job.  No, because we're paying.  And we always want people to reflect that.  It is a totalitarian seizure of power.  That's what the Green New Deal is.  The government dictates every part of our lives, everything.  So if you want, you can still get to Cuba.  All right, they have cruises that go there.  It's harder.  I was there, as you know.  You should go.  And you should see.  What happens when the government controls every part of people's lives?  It's 90 miles away from Miami.  You get down to Keys, have a nice time, and then whip over from Port Everglades to Havana for a couple of days.  Now they're going to follow you, and I've got to let you run around, but you'll see.  You'll see.  So when you present that to the Green New Deal Democratic Party, remember the whole party is invested in this now.  There aren't any dissenters because, as I said, the Twitter mob will destroy them.  No dissent.  Now, Pelosi doesn't like it.  She's, but running for president?  Not one of them.  I mean, Bloomberg, but he's not really a Democrat.  So know what this is.  They say socialism, but that doesn't really do it.  It's totalitarianism.  And if you don't like it, you go to prison.  So if I say I'm not paying 70% of my assets to the federal government, I'm in cuffs.  I'm gone.  I gotta pay it.  If I'm here, if I live here.  Do you know how many people are leaving New York State to go to Florida and North Carolina?  So many that there was a shortfall of $3.2 billion in tax receipts in Albany.  Wealthy people, particularly those who are retiring, ain't going.  Because it's crazy, and they know what Cuomo's capable of doing.  So this is what's going to be on a national level. ",
