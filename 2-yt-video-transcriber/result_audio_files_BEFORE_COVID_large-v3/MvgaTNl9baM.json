            "text": "What's up everybody?  It's your girl back for another video.  So this video was requested.  Someone wanted to know what is my opinion about what happened with Michonne Lynch.  about a week ago, the Seattle Hawks running back.  Now, for those of you that are not familiar with the story, a little bit of background.  So about a week ago, Sean Lynch was running his football camp, and he was in the middle of training.  A couple of little boys weren't doing what they were supposed to be doing.  They were acting up.  So he told them, get the fuck off my field, go run some laps, and come back when you're ready to do what you're supposed to do.  Now, instead of doing that, the little boys apparently started crying and running to their moms.  okay moms got really offended pissed off.  sean lynch trying to be a gentleman goes up to him.  um you know my apologies no disrespect i did tell them that i want them to be serious be responsible i'm trying to teach not only responsibility but accountability and that their actions have consequences.  so yes i did tell them that.  um That's just how I run my camp.  And they got highly offended.  So he said, again, no disrespect, but is there a man that I can talk to?  You know, husband, the child's father.  Woman got highly offended that he dare imply that she have a husband or the father of her child with her.  So another woman butts in, another mother, all pissed off and angry.  And he tells her, excuse me, ma'am, is there a man with you that I can speak to?  Is there a man anywhere with any of you that I can speak to?  All of these women took their children out of the football camp and they ran to TMZ.  TMZ did a story, of course, they're liberal and they're calling him a sexist, a misogynist pig, a sexist, and even some calling him racist now.  So this is my opinion about the story.  First and foremost, if we have 9, 10, 11, 12 year old boys that are crying because they heard the F word, we have a serious problem.  You know, the women, the single mothers in this incident were upset because he was cursing and that he asked to speak to a man, the father or the husband of these women.  And this is the thing, I bet you any money, all of these little boys have a cell phone, a social media account.  listening to all this dirty ass music that they got kids listening to nowadays with all this cursing and this vulgar shit.  and you know the the shit that they hear on these video games that they playing.  you know liberals love to say oh my god you're cursing in front the kids the poor little kids.  but yet they create the most violent video games the most um vulgar movies, TV shows, and music.  So don't even give me that crap.  We got a big problem if they crying over hearing some damn cuss words.  And I bet you their mama curses in front of them.  The next thing is there is nothing wrong with him asking to speak to a man.  If that was me there, I would have had no problem with him talking to my husband.  But you know what?  I wouldn't have argued with the man in the first place.  If my son did something wrong and came running to me, I would have told him, Get your ass back out there on that field and do what he told you to do.  Because I teach my children that their actions have consequences.  Real life, the real world has consequences.  And you need to teach your children and instill in them responsibility, accountability, and that real life has consequences.  All children are not winners.  You don't just grow up and have things thrown in your lap and get everything for free.  You have to go out there and work very hard to have what you have and to be successful.  It takes work.  It's not free.  It's not something that you deserve to have unless you earn it and work for it.  OK, so these women are not doing their sons any favors by trying to tell this professional, successful football star how to run his football camp.  If they knew so much about football and how to play and how to make their son successful, then they could have trained them, their sons themselves.  But I bet you they don't.  Bet you they don't even know how to, you know, because they don't chase their man off or slept with some man that they hardly knew or the man just couldn't deal with their mouth anymore and left them.  So the next thing is, it's just a sad state of affairs that we're living in a time where it's offensive to ask a woman if you could speak to her husband.  You know, even if she doesn't have a husband, why is that so offensive?  You know, it's like it's offensive nowadays, the notion of a husband.  Man, woman, child.  That's offensive.  It's offensive to say that now.  You know, that's absolutely absurd to me.  It's so unnatural.  You know, it's natural to have man, woman, child.  You know, but this is the left we're talking about.  The left, their mantra is to call anyone that doesn't agree with them at any time a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a bigot, a neo-Nazi, a xenophobe.  That's their mantra.  That's what they resort to.  They hate facts.  And anytime you have a disagreement with anyone that is liberal or the left in general, that's what they do.  You know, oh, well, you must be racist if you don't agree with me.  You're sexist, too.  And on top of it all, you're homophobic.  So.  I don't think Sean Lynch is sexist at all.  I don't see anything wrong with what he did.  This man is a professional football player.  He's making millions of dollars.  You know, he might have went to college on a football scholarship, but damn it, if there's one thing he knows how to do and he does it well, it's run with that damn football.  And these women are trying to tell him how to run his camp.  And they're offended that he wanted to speak to the father of these young boys.  You know, that's a damn shame that that's the kind of time that we're living in.  It really is.  It's sad.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Again, if that was me, I would have had no problem with him.  You know, the two men... working it out about the boys.  you know that's the way it should be.  so that's my opinion on the story.  let me know below what do you think about the story?  you think mashaun lynch is a sexist for asking to speak to the fathers of these young boys or the husband of these women?  um you know do you think it was wrong that he was cursing?  do you think you know what is your opinion about the story?  and like the video?  if you did subscribe if you want to hear more and i'll see y'all back on my next video bye.
