And it's especially hard in this economy.  And guess what?  Many women say they are finding it very hard to find a man who makes as much as they do.  A study by Cornell University found that the country's declining marriage rate is due to the lack of financially eligible bachelors.  Women are actually outpacing men with education, and this is changing the age-old mentality that men are the breadwinners.  In turn, the gig or small gigs economy and lack of good jobs out there have left the ladies single and disgruntled.  And researchers say they are seeing a trend of women dating down. ",

But you have to contextualize that because women don't want to date down, not just financially, but in other ways.  Women want to date men who are taller than them.  Women want to date men who are their age or older.  And women generally date men who have their income level or above.  That is a fact.  And what we like.  And it's not me saying this. ",

So you put your heel on the back end of the shoe and you feel it and you start dragging your foot like bro.  Yeah, you got your purse.  Yeah You start dragging.  All right, stop following me.  What the?  if you only date people at your level or above and if men are only used to dating women who are beneath them in terms of income level you are inherently making your field of play really small.  the opportunities that you're going to have are going to be limited.  let me put it this way right if If there are 100 women who make $50,000, and there are 100 men who make $50,000, right?  If these 100 men only date women beneath their income level, they're not gonna look hitch, right?  So you're gonna have to look at the income level above, generally speaking, okay?  And so if you are trying to date men who make, let's say, 80K, right, but there's only 50 of them, and there's 100 women here making 50K, then yeah, there's going to only be 50 men for those 100 women.  And here's the worst part.  Those 50 men don't necessarily want to date you.  They may want to date women who are making 10K or 20K.  They don't give a fuck because they're not looking at income level when they choose their partner.  And so if you're only dating men who are above you or at your level, you are severely limiting the potential partners that you may have based only on how much money they make and how much they can bring.  And I don't want anyone in the comments... to say that financial security is not really important.  Because 70 to 91% of all divorces come and are initiated by women.  And majority of those divorces are done for financial reasons, for financial security.  A lot of people are finding it hard to date.  And I'm like, if it is hard for you, why would you make it extra difficult by adding these extra barriers to you finding a partner? ",
