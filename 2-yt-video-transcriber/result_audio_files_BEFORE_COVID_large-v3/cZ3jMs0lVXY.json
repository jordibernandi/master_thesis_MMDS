Now it's no surprise, it's no news to you that the Avengers cast all love Brie Larson, the savior, the new face of Marvel.  And there has been a huge press junket going on recently where most of the Avengers are touring around one or two of the original cast along with Brie Larson, which I'm sure is on purpose so that they're ushering in the new face of Marvel, totally makes sense and i understand every reason why they're doing it.  but out of this press tour has come some absolutely merciless merciless ribbing.  some of it seems good-natured while other parts of it seem like there's a general disdain for uh brie larson.  so let's see let's do a little.  greatest hits of all the great roasts in just the past few days.  And also we're going to talk about Brie Larson's little who-want-to-lie about doing all her own stunts. ",

Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe they're more bad at the situation where it's really like the end of their time and they're being passed up.  Not only is the torch being passed, but it's being passed to basically the most OP superhero of all time.  And they're just, it's, it's in their mind.  It might be bad enough that they're basically done in these roles, but now also they're not even the most powerful, you know, Captain Marvel's just stronger, better, faster than all of them at everything that, Maybe there's a little bit of that.  They're a little sick of all the Captain Marvel hype.  These, I think, would be natural emotions, natural reactions to this.

            "text": "Wow.  Well, now that's an interesting statement to make, Brie Larson.  See, I think I wonder if now you're giving Hemsworth the business about not doing his own stunts.  He has a stunt double.  But if you're watching this video now, there is clear photographic evidence of Brie Larson's stunt doubles.  So was this double just on the set?  for moral support?  Or did you have a stunt double and did you lie about doing all of your stunts?  See, only one of those two can be true.  And who can forget the fact that Brie Larson's own butt Had to have a stunt double.  And they give some other body sides.  You've got to have a head shot, full body shot, and a full body shot of your backside wearing all black.  Please put body double in the subject line.  Now, in an act of fairness and accuracy, we do have to state that the cult does not directly say that the double will be for Brie Larson as it could be for Scarlett Johansson, unlikely, who plays Black Widow in the film.  But while we're still in the speculation of the story, we speculate.  Why might she need a butt double?  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, you're going to have to really wonder why she might have a butt double.  I'm not butt shaming her.  I'm just saying, hey... You know, even your butt isn't real in the film.  That doesn't seem very woke.  And if you're going to give other Avengers the business for not doing all their stunts, well, you better hope that pictures of your stunt double don't pop out like they already did.  But the question to you, which is your favorite low-key Avengers roast of Brie Larson?  Do you think that the feeling is real, that they really don't like her?  Because I think I could definitely understand.  There may be a certain degree of this that isn't even Bree's fault, that they're just like, yo, this is our thing.  It's been our thing forever.  And now we've got to pass it off to somebody else who's being anointed, who didn't have to earn their way like we did.  in as stand-ons or or side casts in films earning eventually your own feature films.  i could definitely understand feeling that way.  uh you've got you know you've got someone coming in who quote unquote hasn't earned it not to say that she's not a award-winning actress but that she hasn't earned her keep in the marvel universe like most everyone else has.  do you think that the the vitriol is real or do you think they're just ribbing her?  because in some of the cuts it seems like they're just kind of busting her chops a little bit?  but some of the other cuts particularly with chris hemsworth it seems like a little bit more savagery there.  like he doesn't like this woman.  but i know you'll never actually get a real answer from any of these people in public because that's just not what you do same thing like.  if you think about a sports team Not everybody on a baseball team likes each other, but they're not going to go out public and say, hey, I don't like this guy or gal or whatever the case may be.  But that's my top five or six Avengers low-key roasts of Brie Larson.  I hope you enjoyed it.  I hope that you do enjoy Marvel Endgame.  I hope it's everything you wished it would be.  I, for one, am not going to spend three hours in the theater to see that movie, but perhaps I shall watch it when it comes out on DVD.  I hope you enjoyed this video.  We'll talk to you again real soon. ",
