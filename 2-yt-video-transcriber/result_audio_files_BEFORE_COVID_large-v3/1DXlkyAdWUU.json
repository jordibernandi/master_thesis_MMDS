            "text": "What's up, heathens?  How ya doin'?  I'm John Gleeson, the Godless Engineer, and I spent my entire life as a Christian.  Until one day, one of my closest friends challenged my faith in the Christian God.  He told me that you have to believe everything in the Bible, or else you're not a real Christian.  I had never considered the idea that I wasn't a Christian, because there was no way that I could believe all of the fantastical things that were in the Bible.  I always felt like that was the only option available to me, until I started considering what I actually believed.  At the end of that journey, I realized that I was an atheist.  Since then, I have dedicated my free time to learning why all of these apologists that we see everywhere nowadays are simply wrong when they talk about history, science, politics, and even their own religion.  I started my YouTube channel to help people just like me find community outside of religion, as well as learn why people are just simply wrong when they say things like evolution is a lie or atheists don't exist.  I wanted to inspire fellow atheists as well as other religious people to stand up and use their voice against the false information that's being regurgitated on social media.  We discuss all of these topics five times a week to help you find that community as well as teach you some things that you may not know.  If you want to know why these apologist talking points are wrong about religion, atheism, history, and politics, then I invite you to subscribe to learn with me. ",
