Thank you very much.  Instagram is the place where fitness goes to fucking die for many, many, many reasons.  And I'm going to get into that a little bit today, not just from the idiot that I showed in the very beginning from Gymshark Train.  There's several things that are always very true about Gymshark Train.  Getting your training advice from Gymshark Train is like getting your antibiotics from a dealer on the street corner.  Most of the time it is not going to work and it is stupid as fuck and chances are you're going to be left pretty physically fucked up.  I don't know what the fuck he was doing.  I think he was trying to emulate something else he saw on Instagram and did that whole thing that Instagram does.  Let's make it harder.  Let's make it better.  Like even ESPN showed this shit.  Shout out to the older dude in the back just nailing free throws.  Just nailing free throws, waiting to hear that dude pile drive himself from 20 feet in the air straight down into the ground so his spine goes through his fucking ass.  I mean, that's just stupid shit.  Stupid shit.  That's on ESPN.  And I understand they're like, it's just a trick and all that, but it's on Instagram.  It's dangerous as fuck and it's on Instagram.  Just like the dude at the very beginning.  Even when it's not dangerous as fuck, you got people doing shit just to sell shit.  Just like, here's Alexia Clark just selling bands. ",

            "text": "The over-complication of exercises just to sell bands.  Here's reality.  Just squat.  Women, just squat.  There's no need to hook yourself and wrap a band around you 25 times and put it onto a barbell and push it.  Just squat.  Just squat.  I mean, she is using up a squat rack and a bench to do something she could do standing with a bandwagon around her legs, too.  Like, I would be so pissed if I was in that gym and I wanted to squat and she's in there doing that shit.  I mean, I don't care that, you know, she's like 99% made of plastic.  I still really would just want to squat, you know?  Those things are all ridiculous.  They're horrible, horrible, horrible examples of what is dangerous and on Instagram everywhere and what is just useless and on Instagram everywhere.  I do not understand what Instagram is doing, but I did want to point out emerging trend.  Instagram has going on.  And this is not necessarily directed at any of the particular people that I'm about to show or have been showing in this video, but this is just a serious problem.  Instagram is now taking down photos Of people, like transformation photos.  I don't even believe Meg Squats had a picture of her in a bikini taken down.  Just in a bikini.  From the picture I saw, it wasn't even anything crazy.  Like, just her standing there in a bikini got taken down.  And this young lady had her transformation photo taken down.  Listed as self-harm.  Like, her losing weight to get to a healthy weight was flagged and taken down as self-harm.  That is taken down as self-harm.  But this... ",

A very, very small population, a very, very small percentage of the population is actually fit, is actually even into fitness at all, is actually into being healthy.  So we have 70% of the population is overweight or obese.  There's a bunch of people that are of a healthy weight but are not healthy because they don't actually take care of themselves.  They eat like crap.  They just eat crap at a level of caloric maintenance and stay at what would be called a healthy body weight even though they feed themselves crap.  So they're probably undernourished and they don't have good body composition.  They're not looking out for their long-term health.  there's a very small percentage of the people a very small percentage of the population that actually gives a about their health right now.  and yet those people those people that give a about their health in some way now it's like certain social media outlets are trying to silence them.  That is extremely fucked up and it's a very dangerous narrative.  When you can show a morbidly obese woman jamming cake into her face and popularize it to the point where it has close to almost, it's on the way to get a million views.  A million people viewing that.  That is a dangerous narrative all itself.  But then when you're going to silence a very positive thing of a woman going from an unhealthy body weight to a healthy body weight.  She is not over thin.  She is not too thin.  She works out.  If they would have bothered checking out the rest of her profile.  She did it for her health.  and they take that down as self-harm, but they will show people eating copious amounts of food and doing dangerous ass exercises, that shit gets to stay up.  In my opinion, of course, Instagram needs to do something about this.  Watching a morbidly obese person eat copious amounts of food, that's self-harm.  That is the equivalent to watching an alcoholic drink a lot of alcohol.  That really is.  That is the same thing.  It really, really, really is.  Watching a morbidly obese person eat... tons of food especially low calorically.  that like low nutritionally valued food is self-harm.  it truly is especially in the grandeur of it's not taken as a serious thing.  in reality when somebody is 350 400 pounds they have a serious physical problem.  they are going to be damaging themselves if they are 5 5 and over 300 pounds.  as tess holiday is and many other people that i see on instagram doing like this.  That is a dangerous narrative to be showing them eating copious amounts of food just for the sake of eating.  She is sitting, in that video, she is sitting with a cake, a whole cake on her lap.  Eating.  Eating it from the middle.  Like a savage.  I don't know why.  Every time I see that video, that bothers me that she eats it from the middle.  I don't know why.  But that is self-harm.  It just absolutely is.  There's no way, two ways around that.  Watching somebody go to a healthy weight, if they're underweight and moving, like, are we going to have Eugenia Cooney?  When she shows a skinny picture and then an after picture of her at a healthier weight, is that going to get taken down as self-harm?  Because going from the skinny weight to a healthy weight for her is very healthy.  That is actually helping herself.  That is actually getting help.  That is not self-harm at all.  But showing somebody go from being overweight or obese to a healthy weight is self-harm somehow.  Instagram, I understand, is a business.  I totally get it.  And I understand that they're going to pander to certain audiences.  But this type of pandering to the point where it can't even be seen that a person is actually being healthy, we're actually trying to silence the healthy example, is a very dangerous narrative.  in my two cents.  Of course, my name is Alan Roberts.  Hit me up on Instagram at EverydayFitness.  Hit me up on Twitter at EverydayFitness.  I'm also on Facebook at EverydayFitness.  And I'm on the internet at EverydayFitness.net.  Goddamn. ",
