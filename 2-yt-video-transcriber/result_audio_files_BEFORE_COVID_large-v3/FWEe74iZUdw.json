            "text": "Hello, this is your sister Karen Gillanin, Jesus Christ doesn't move.  Just with this quick update, hi guys this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  sorry let me just get this camera perfect.  yeah that's better.  sorry this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  guys I'm coming to you.  this is not a revelation it is not a vision and it is not a dream.  I wanted to share this with you from a very long time but I didn't get time to do it.  but now I'm getting the time to record this video.  so basically The Lord showed me something.  I think it's the year 2016 or 17.  I will leave the correct year at the end of this video.  But the Lord showed me something either in 2016 or 17 March.  And this is when Barack and Michelle visited Cuba.  And I was at home and just fellowshipping with some of my brothers and sisters on Facebook.  And the Lord said to me, turn the TV on.  So I decided to turn the television on.  And when I turned the TV on, ladies and gentlemen, the Lord said, turn to BBC News.  And I did exactly as the Lord told me.  I was just in time to see Barack and Michelle going up the plane and standing on the platform waving.  to the people.  and ladies and gentlemen as Michelle did not turn around I don't think but Barack turned around.  and as he turned around ladies and gentlemen I could not believe who I was looking at.  I was absolutely shell-shocked.  it did not look like Barack Obama at all.  it was like almost You were morphing.  That's all I could put it that the camera caught.  And I paused the TV because at the time I had paused and rewind television.  and I paused the television, the TV and rewind it back to when, uh, he was going on the plane.  Cause I thought, okay, maybe my eyes was fooling me.  And I rewind it back to when he was going up the staircase on the plane.  And I did that.  And then he turned around, uh, and wave goodbye.  And it's exactly the same image that I saw.  And I paused it again and I took a photograph and took the photograph.  I didn't even go close to the TV because the aura and the entity that was coming from this man was incredible evil.  And so I took the photograph and I just turned the TV back off.  And my brothers and sisters that I was fellowshipping with, I sent them the photo and I said, can you see any change in Obama?  And they said to me, no, they can't see any change.  And I just found it really, really strange.  So I went back into my gallery and pull up the photograph.  And ladies and gentlemen, the image.  that I saw on the TV that that was the same image on the photograph.  and would you believe me that over the course of about two weeks the photograph kept changing.  the photograph kept changing it would just keep it just kept on morphing even though what took the photo two weeks ago?  and so I will leave some of the photos at the end of this video.  because what i've done?  i took one single photograph and then obviously i zoomed in to see what was going on and it was changing.  and you can see his teeth changing his hands.  uh the palm of his hands has no line.  uh you know that we as human beings we all have lines in the palm of our hands.  he had no lines in his hands And there's some scaling on his skin and all sorts.  But I'll let you be the judge.  I'm just going to leave the photographs and then you can have a little look and see what you think.  But I just wanted to show that, you know, a lot of people talk about shape shifting.  Is it real or is it not real?  From this photo, 100% shape shifting.  It is a real thing.  And, you know, as Christ is coming back, and his return is close we're going to see some things ladies and gentlemen.  so it's best to be it's not best to be but you must be you must be spiritually armored and spiritually prepared.  so i just wanted to come to you and share these photographs with you that i took and pinched and zoom in and obviously screenshot and i will leave them at the end of this video.  so god eternally bless you.  i love you all and i see you soon someday In glory, in Jesus' precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen.  Thank you. ",
