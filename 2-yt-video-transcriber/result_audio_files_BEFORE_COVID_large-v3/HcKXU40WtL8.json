            "text": "I am perplexed by this poll for two reasons.  First, either the people of Iowa are schizophrenic or they just aren't convinced.  They remain skeptical.  And I don't think the people of Iowa are schizophrenic, although they do have two horrifying GOP senators as their senators.  But that's a separate conversation for a separate day.  This poll is not an outlier.  This is, in fact, as Fernand said, the gold standard.  This is it.  When it came out last night at 7 o'clock or whatever time it came out, Eastern Time, I looked at it and went, no way in hell is this right.  But it has to be right because it's Des Moines, right?  It's the Des Moines Register and CNN.  And so, I mean, I just don't see this.  I think a lot can change between now and the day of those caucuses.  These numbers, they tell me something at 30,000 feet.  They tell me nothing on the ground in Des Moines or Dubuque or anywhere else.  That's my takeaway from it. ",

            "text": "So what you just heard there was Jimmy Williams on Joy Reid's MSNBC show.  And why this clip is important is that it shows just how speechless Bernie Sanders' surge is rendering much of the mainstream media.  If you listen to this clip, sure, Jimmy Williams says plenty of words, but he doesn't actually say a single damn thing.  All he's trying to say is he's skeptical about the poll.  But in the same breath, he acknowledges that this poll is one of the best in the country, one of the best in Iowa.  It's a fantastic predictor of who wins Iowa and often who wins the entire primary process.  And there's no real way to dispute the quality and and accuracy of this particular poll.  And so all he can say is that it doesn't really say much, that it doesn't really jive with the previous polls because it shows a rather large increase for Bernie Sanders and a big decline for Pete Buttigieg.  And all he can muster is that something feels wrong with this poll, guys.  And there's no pushback there, and of course there's no pushback, because Joy Reid and much of MSNBC has consistently tried to downplay or ignore or attack Bernie Sanders during this entire primary process.  like most of mainstream media.  Joy Reid in particular has always sort of been a harsh, I would say often unfair critic of Bernie Sanders, and there's no way that on her show they would be giving an open, clear, hey, things are going pretty well for Bernie Sanders, contest isn't over yet, but the Des Moines Register poll is a great poll.  Jimmy Williams isn't going to be saying that on Joy Reid's show.  And this shows... A good example of what we're going to see more and more and more as Bernie Sanders' surge continues to be reflected in the polling data.  Not just in Iowa, but in the other early states, and as I noted on this channel a couple days ago, in national polling as well.  where it's at least a two-horse race between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden in many polls.  And in some of those polls, Bernie Sanders has the lead over Joe Biden.  They're close races, but Bernie Sanders is edging Joe Biden in some pretty reputable national polls from firms like Ipsos Reuters.  And I think that's really important.  And you're going to see the mainstream media try to find some way of discounting this evidence.  When the polls have Biden or Buttigieg and even Warren doing well, the polls are more likely to be accepted.  But when Bernie Sanders is doing well, the polls are ignored or Bernie Sanders isn't mentioned in the coverage or here.  when he can't be ignored because he's leading or All they can say is, oh, something doesn't feel right about this poll.  I guess this tells us something theoretically, but the on-the-ground data must be different.  And this doesn't make sense from what I know about Iowa and Iowa politics, because at the end of the day, there's two choices.  They can either trash the quality of this poll, and this poll's reputation is beyond reproach, or they can just try to make stuff up.  And in this case, they've tried the latter.  And all of this shows... that they really have nothing to counter Bernie with right now.  The man is leading in fundraising by quite a bit and not from big donors, but from individual Americans, which means he's not only getting the most donations and he's not only getting the most money, but he's getting the most individual donors.  And those individual donors are all Americans with a vote.  One person cutting you a check in a wine cave is just one vote.  But tens and tens of thousands of working class teachers and service workers and Walmart workers giving what they can when they can.  Those are all potential voters.  That's a great sign for Bernie.  Bernie Sanders in the polling is doing better and better and better.  He's not leading in every poll.  He's not winning in every poll.  Joe Biden's still polling very well.  But Bernie Sanders is clearly competitive to win this thing.  And as we've seen, the electability argument is sort of Joe Biden's last barrier.  But even there, Bernie Sanders, in addition to Joe Biden, polls consistently well in hypothetical matchups against Donald Trump nationally and in some pretty important swing states.  And when you add all of that together, all of the actual arguments against Bernie Sanders, he can't win.  He can't compete with the billionaire-backed candidates in fundraising.  He can't beat Trump.  The polling doesn't look good.  Warren's passing him.  All of these arguments we've heard over the past year.  They're falling one by one by one by one.  And so the MSNBC crowd, the mainstream media crowd has their traditional attacks on Bernie Sanders.  The quote unquote, he's too extreme argument, even though it's becoming very clear that extreme candidates don't often lead in national polling and in key state polling and in fundraising and win general election hypothetical matchup polls.  But they're still try that.  But the other thing they have is just saying, well, none of this makes sense.  None of this makes sense.  We're just going to stick our head in the sand.  We're going to stick our fingers in our ear.  And we're just going to ignore the fact that Bernie Sanders is one of the strongest candidates in this contest.  And Bernie Sanders is undisputably the one with the biggest momentum right now.  They are losing it.  I've noted this in my previous video.  Donald Trump and the Republicans are losing it because they're trying to attack Bernie Sanders.  But the attacks that worked for Trump and the Republicans against Clinton and would work against a Democratic nominee like Joe Biden.  aren't going to work on Bernie Sanders.  The right-wing populist attacks won't work on Bernie Sanders.  So everyone's getting really desperate.  And that's a great sign for Bernie, his team, and his millions of supporters across the country and indeed around the world.  So I want people to see this clip and understand that despite the fact That it's kind of infuriating to watch a politics expert say nothing because he can't say anything that fits his worldview and the worldview of his host.  But what it does show is that we're winning.  That the left is winning.  That Bernie Sanders is winning.  That democratic socialism is winning.  And that they have nothing to say about it.  So let's use this as a momentum booster.  Share this clip around for an example of how Bernie Sanders is rendering the mainstream media speechless.  and let's keep pushing. ",
