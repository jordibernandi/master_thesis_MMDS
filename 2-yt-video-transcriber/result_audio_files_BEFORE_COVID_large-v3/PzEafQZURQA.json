But it's Cenk Uygur who's running for California 25, 25th district in California.  He's running for that seat.  And he goes on this radio show called The Talk of Santa Clarita.  Santa Clarita is inside of California's 25th.  And this is a guy who seems to be a more centrist leaning guy.  He is Christy Smith's buddy.  And he's had her on a couple times.  And it's cool that he's having Cenk on, of course.  That is very cool.  And it's going to get a little bit testy.  It's going to get a little tense here.  It's very interesting.  and uh jank is gonna kind of you know go off.  they're gonna kind of go off on each other a little bit.  so the question here is you know a lot of people have been saying jank is a carpetbagger uh even though he lives like 20 to 25 minutes away which is hilarious.  so he's gonna respond to those allegations and he's gonna respond to that criticism.

So what does that mean?  Like I've seen Republicans, they try to make out Bernie to seem like this ultra rich guy so that we can stop talking about Medicare for all, wealth inequality, free college, minimum wage,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.  They don't want to talk about any of that.  So they figure out a way to skirt the issue.  They do the same thing.  What these corporate Democrats have been doing, Christy Smith and her ilk have been doing, what they've been doing is they've been trying to basically shield this entire thing through these old video clips out of context, video clips of jank.  another one now is the whole carpetbagger thing and it's clear as jenk explains there.  he's obviously taking this very seriously.  he's obviously done his homework for the district.  he's not a clown like papadopoulos is okay.  he's not just in this to mess around.  and if you don't know like i've actually seen video you can look it up.  there's video of him doing like events at like coffee shops.  i saw like one of his you know uh where he just went.  he just spoke to people in california twenty five in a uh... coffee shop you know.  and he post twitter pictures of meeting up with voters and you know talking to them and things like that so clearly.  he's a serious person but you should really make a decision based on who it is you agree with the most okay.  if you believe in medicare for all in your a progressive and you know don't like corruption why did corruption out money?  you know money in politics out of our system?  Why on earth would you vote for Christy Smith?  That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  And so to me, that whole thing is ridiculous.  And it's super ridiculous because she's literally, he is literally 20 to 25 minutes away from the district currently.  So you're talking about like a 20, 25 minute drive from the district.  Do you know how short that is of a drive from the district?  That's an absolute joke.  Such a joke of an argument.  And I found it hilarious that the guy sort of brings up the whole Katie Hill and, you know, her handpicking her and all this stuff as if that's a good thing, as if that's legit.  Like, this is disgusting.  This totally just destroys the idea of democracy.  I mean, if you just listen to that beginning part, Sounds like a monarchy to me.  It sounds like, oh yeah, you just handpick your successors.  There's no real democratic voting process.  Whoever's next in line in the state assembly line, that's who's next up.  They're coronated.  They're given the crown.  And they're crowned to be representative.  Okay?  which is disgusting.  we should be you know a democratic system and i've seen this so much with corporate democrats people who are neoliberals thinking that it's all just this coronation of the next candidate.  no it's a primary and you have to win the election by winning over the voters.  that's what you have to do and i find it hilarious that this is just like a mind-blowing thing.  but so many people like if you remember hillary clinton the goddess of these corporate democrats probably the goddess of you know maybe even christie smith i don't know.  But, you know, she became a senator in New York.  She never lived there a day in her life.  And at the time, she was called a carpetbagger by some folks.  So, you know, it's just this bullshit thing just to, again, not talk about the issues once again, man.  So I recommend watching the rest of this.  I might maybe do some more segments on this long talk.  But Cenk absolutely bulldozed this guy. ",
