            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to Moon Ride.  Today we're going to take a look at that whistleblower complaint.  I have to tell you, I find this to be one very intriguing story.  I just have a kind of gut feeling that it is really, really, really important.  And that this is one major blow to the Trump administration.  But I could be wrong.  This is just a personal opinion.  Let's check in with Spirit.  And maybe we can also find out if this has some specific meaning.  I'd like to know what it's about first.  But let's see.  What the man in the moon tells us.  So Spirit, what's going on with this whistleblower complaint?  Hmm.  I kind of see a parchment, and I see almost like the old paper-type parchment, and somebody's writing.  What is William Barr doing there?  Huh.  And maybe it's just because Barr's the major force behind stopping it.  I don't know what Barr's doing here in this image.  Spirit, what's Barr doing here?  Sneaky.  That's what he's doing.  He's being sneaky.  He's having trouble with this one.  He's having trouble fielding this one for Donald Trump.  Again, I don't know the different agencies and who reports what on a personal level, but I do see Barr somehow involved.  Man, is Trump worried about this one?  I usually see Trump being kind of angry and choleric.  This time he just looks really red-faced, almost as if he's embarrassed.  And I think this is very funny because one thing you'll notice about Trump and Trump supporters is You simply cannot embarrass them.  No matter how bad the material is, how traitorous it is, they never get embarrassed.  They're never shamed.  So, Spirit, why is Trump's face so red?  Because he is a bit helpless.  He's not going to be able to stop this one.  Spirit, what did it involve?  What did he do?  Who is he talking to?  Hmm.  It seems like he's, I get Russia and Turkey, and I wonder if it's Russia involved in Turkey or something like this.  So, Spirit, again, who was he speaking to directly?  I do get it that it's Putin.  That it may involve another country.  Spirit, what was he talking about with Putin?  Hmm.  I do think Ukraine is involved.  And I see Putin just laughing and laughing because Trump is so stupid that he's given this information away.  He's on recording.  I mean, he gave Putin all the information that Putin needs to blackmail and embarrass Trump if he wants to.  So Putin's got all the power here.  What else can we know about this?  I think he promised.  I just see his hand, what looks like Ukraine.  And he seems to be like stopping it and saying, we won't go further.  You know, we'll alleviate this for you.  Don't worry about it.  It's all good.  I get that it really is a question of giving away power to Putin, and Putin could now embarrass and or blackmail Trump just by revealing what he said on those calls.  You notice that Trump already said, why would I be so stupid as to blab like that?  Of course I know everybody's listening to me.  Whenever you hear Trump, always think the opposite.  Of course he's that stupid.  We've seen him be that stupid about every five minutes.  This is a guy who went and told Lester Holt he was obstructing justice.  Duh, he's that dumb, of course.  But always notice that Trump, it's the opposite.  If he tells you he's not doing something, that's because he is.  If he tells you the Democrats are doing something, that's because he's doing it.  Okay, so can we know any more about this?  It's really bad.  That's just like a feeling that I get.  It's really bad.  I see ships.  It involves ships.  I think that maybe has something to do with the shipping lanes.  It's funny because I kind of see these old ships, these old boats.  And I know that, I don't know everything about geography, but I know that Russia really doesn't have that much access to water.  Maybe there's some access near the North Sea or something.  It kind of has this feeling of boats in the North Sea and destroying them or sinking.  Okay, now I'm seeing a submarine.  I feel like I'm in the submarine.  And I'm looking, and I'm looking, maybe I'm looking at Ukraine.  Again, I don't even know if Ukraine's on the water.  But I seem to be in a submarine, and I seem to be looking at a city.  And I get a feeling like I'm spying.  And again, Putin's face comes up.  So I think it has to do with Putin spying on others, on other countries.  And again, Putin just laughs and laughs and laughs.  Now, one thing you just notice in your normal political day, every single thing that Trump has done has benefited Putin.  Even the kind of, you know, fight with Iran.  That's just made billions for Putin.  Oil prices are going to go up in his country.  It's going to be great for him.  It's great for his power.  Everything Trump does is great for Putin's power.  It's never the opposite.  Now, I know that there are some sanctions, but Trump really didn't want those sanctions.  Does this have to do with those sanctions?  Does this have something to do with the sanctions?  Yeah, maybe when shipping, I'm just thinking of the money and goods.  Is that what we mean?  Again, it kind of has to do with sanctions.  That's not the only thing, but it has something to do with sanctions.  Boats, I'm getting lots of boats.  Now I'm getting a rowboat.  Okay.  Ah, hmm, this is interesting.  So there's a rowboat, and there's Putin, and there's Trump in the boat.  And then there's one person that's almost like an outline.  I don't see who that person is.  I think I don't know who that person is.  And I think most people don't.  It's not a famous person, perhaps.  But it's almost like a ghost.  It's almost like this third person in between the two of them.  Hmm.  Uh, spirit, can you show me something that definitely shows me it is Russia and Putin?  Yeah, I'm getting a bear.  Okay.  That's gotta be Russia.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm getting Siberia.  Lots of, lots of snow.  Um, I, I'm pretty sure this is, um, this is Russia.  So, uh, what will be the consequences of this?  Wow, really humiliation for Trump.  This'll be very hard for the Republicans to justify.  I get Trump being interrogated and it's almost like the, um, Those, um, Senate hearings.  I don't think it's an open hearing and I don't even necessarily know if it's a real hearing, but it's like a hearing with, uh, Republicans really, really given it to him.  I think behind the scenes, Republicans are a freaking out and B he's starting to lose them because national security is national security.  They know what's at stake here.  Yeah, this is one of those things.  they might turn on him.  The Republicans might turn on Trump because it's that bad.  It is that hard to justify.  Man, are they angry.  And it's kind of like they just reached a certain threshold.  And they're like no longer intimidated by him.  And they've just gotten to this point where, you know, he is just becoming a liability.  And they finally lose it.  Lindsey Graham was willing to, you know, suck up to Trump only so much.  So as he sucks up to Trump, he is... He's finally done.  It's like this thing is making him so angry.  It's so problematic for his own reelection.  because let's face it, most of these guys care nothing about our nation.  They care only about their reelection and power.  And Lindsey Graham is just, you know, it's funny because I see him behind a chain link fence.  Oh, and now he's finally climbing over the fence.  Believe me, it's a funny image to imagine.  Lindsey Graham climbing anything, but, um, he's climbed over this fence and he's just like, you know, you're no longer protected Donald.  It's like almost like a zombie, you know, it's like, I'm going to kill you, Donald.  I think he finally lost it.  It's finally, I think this might be the thing.  And I kind of had this feeling all day that this really is where Trump finally went too far.  You notice that Moscow Mitch just did institute some protections for our election.  So it worked.  Just giving him the name Moscow Mitch, it worked.  It caused action on his part.  It caused his embarrassment.  It showed the failures of the Republican Party to do anything.  And he corrected it.  So we do have the power.  to eventually embarrass them.  It seems like they're kind of Teflon, but it's not impossible to embarrass them.  And you know what?  the third person, it might not be Turkey, it might be Saudi Arabia.  I just wonder if there's something going on with Russia, Saudi Arabia,  U.S.,  It might also involve just that invisible person, whoever that person is.  It could just be a random... Maybe that person who is the person who is telling the story, you know, the muckraker, what do you call him?  Sorry, sometimes when I do this, words don't come to mind.  But he's the guy who's telling everybody about the problem.  All right, so spirit is our... Is this going to have any significance?  Okay.  Sometimes Spirit does this, which is like, enough, Dave, stop asking.  But this time, Spirit's kind of going like this.  It's funny, because what does that mean?  It is like a house?  Oh, okay.  If you think of our government as like a house, or even if you think of the Senate as like a house, it's almost like the house is collapsing.  I just think of... Lincoln, a house divided cannot stand.  And when I'm seeing this house, I'm seeing a sort of collapsing of the house.  It's like the Senate, it's almost like it's on fire and people are running out of it, like fleeing, like, oh my God, you know, and they're like, like, You know, when you're in that sort of situation where you're fleeing and you'll do anything to get away.  It's like your body starts running and you'll, you know, you'll do anything.  You'll run through fire to get away from the fire.  You know what I mean?  That's the kind of feeling I have when I look at these images.  I just, it's like everybody's scattering out of the Senate.  And I see, you know, Republicans there like looking like freaked out.  Something really is up.  You know how these buildings have these columns, these white pillars?  They're collapsing.  Things are falling in.  It is not a good scene.  Now again, I'd like to point out to everybody, this is not literal.  I don't literally think that the Senate will be attacked or anything like that.  I think it is a symbolic crushing of the Senate, specifically the Republican Party, because Now Nancy Pelosi's there going, I told you so.  She doesn't look scared.  She's like, yep, warned you guys, told you.  And again, you've got to give some credit to Nancy.  I'm all for impeachment, but she seems to have been right.  Just let Trump be Trump and he will hang himself.  And, you know, make sure that the Republicans don't take the Senate.  That's exactly what's happening.  All these guys are going to have to stand in for their constituency and they're all going to raise their hands.  Somebody's going to ask that question.  How could you let a whistleblower is the word.  How could you deny the words of the whistleblower?  You know, this is about national security.  How could you support that?  There will be one intelligent person at the convention who's asking these questions when they go to meet their constituents.  Don't underestimate what this means.  It really is very much a turning point in these events.  Don't forget that Mueller, it all seemed like, well, somewhat ambiguous.  Mueller told us what was really going on.  40% of the people didn't care.  well, 40% of the people don't care and their senators won't act.  There's nothing you can do.  I know a lot of people are criticizing the Democratic Party, but there literally is, if you ask for a subpoena and the person just refuses to answer the subpoena and nobody punishes them, what do you do?  Our system of government was not created for treasonous characters within the Supreme Court and the Senate.  It just... It's just not built that way.  Nobody anticipated that many people would act in such a treasonous fashion and refuse to conform to the laws that our Constitution created.  So it's an incredibly difficult process and it's left us all in this weird, ambiguous, we know what's wrong and there's nothing we can do.  What do we do?  Well, let's try to do something, but we can't.  It won't matter.  It's this weird feeling of frustration.  But you know what?  It ain't over till it's over.  And long ago, when I saw the Miller Report, I kind of found that there's some things that are kind of being held in reserve.  And what's happening now?  We're underscoring that Trump is again committing treason.  It looks to me like with Russia again, doing the same thing.  So it's again proving that all those things in the Miller Report were true.  And there is a practical reality to it.  It's not just like, oh, well, we won the election.  Ha ha.  It's, oh my God, he could do really bad things right now.  A president is not trustworthy.  Is there anything we all want to lend the people?  Look, sometimes destruction has to happen.  so that there is recreation.  And it's really stressful to watch the destruction because you don't know what's going to happen and you can't control it and you don't know where it's going to end.  Do your best to be calm in these situations and just see them for what they are.  Don't hyperbolize.  Don't make them worse.  This is probably a good thing that this terrible events will happen and then it will, you know, cause a really big change in the consciousness of American people.  This will be very bad for the Republican party.  I think this will, I think this is actually maybe it because I'm seeing a split.  It looks like the Senate and this is the thing that'll move it towards the Dems.  This is it.  That's the, that's the feeling that I get when I see this image of, you know, America kind of becoming more blue.  That also appears the Senate becoming more blue.  And I'll just tell you because it's kind of interesting that as I see the Senate, it's like it's not divided into straight lines.  It's almost like the blue line is, the line is crossways.  I wonder what that means.  I don't necessarily know what that means.  But maybe it's just a potential.  Like it might be a little bit dim or it might be a lot dim.  Why is it at an angle?  Okay, he's kind of saying you're right, I think.  Am I right about the, ah, okay.  It is the shift.  So we went from like maybe a split Senate to now a Dem Senate.  I'm getting four.  So I don't know if the rate, the number is going to shift four and become, I think right now we're down 2.2 senators compared to the Republicans.  I don't know if it's going to move to two points pro-Dems or it's going to be four more Dems than the Republicans have.  So I guess that would be 54-46 for the Dems.  I get four.  Again, this might look like destruction.  But take heart.  This is a new era.  This is when we're really, really making a big shift here in the reality.  These guys are exposing themselves for what they are and many layers of the government.  They have essentially committed treason and done a number of illegal acts that they will not be able to get rid of.  You know, it's almost like a dam.  Trump has been able to stop all of the subpoenas, every inquiry, tax returns, all this stuff.  This is the one that bursts the dam.  And if we find these things out about Trump, then there'll be stronger force to reveal his tax returns.  because it might be that his tax returns reveal some connection to this.  It's really like a dam is bursting.  And just watch.  Just watch as it happens.  In some sense, it might be very satisfying to watch this dam sort of burst in the Democrats' favor.  And I would say in America's favor.  Thanks for watching. ",
