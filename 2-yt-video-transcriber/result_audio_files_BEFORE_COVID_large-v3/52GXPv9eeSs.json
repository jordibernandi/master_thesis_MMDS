Biblical Christianity has taught us this good news, that Jesus died to pay the penalty for our sins.  The righteousness of Christ has been imputed to us.  We are given the legal status of being righteous before God, even though we are not righteous.  This new doctrine flips the gospel upside down and teaches us that we are literally righteous, and then we must do certain things to maintain our state of righteousness. ",

If you are burdened by this teaching, you are not alone.  Those of you who claim to be 100% radically in love with God can ignore this video.  Now for everyone else, here's the really good news.  There are no 100% super Christians.  For whatever reason, Todd White is not telling you the truth.  This should not surprise anyone because he pretends to lengthen people's legs and he makes up stories to make himself sound amazing.  He's a master of the humble brag.  This has been proven from his own videos.  The last thing that Christians should be doing is pretending to be 100% righteous super-Christians.  A real man of God says stuff like this, Galatians 6.14.  But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.  By grace you have been saved.  And raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing.  It is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.  Ephesians 2, 4-9.  If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more.  Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews.  As to the law, a Pharisee.  As to zeal, a persecutor of the church.  As to righteousness under the law, blameless.  But whatever gain I had, I count it as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.  For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I might gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ.  Philippians 3, 4-9. ",

Wretched man that I am!  Who will deliver me from this body of death?  Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  So then I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.  Romans 7, 21 to 25.  This has been a Messed Up Church production.
