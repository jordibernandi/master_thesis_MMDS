You know, the problem is a lot of these people already have sacrifice temples they've been using for years.  So to break into it at this point is very hard.  You act like you don't remember me.  I remember you.  Last July, we had a lot of fun.  Come on!  He knows.  So I'm also trying to get into entertainment.  I'm trying to do that.  Has anybody else's boss also killed himself?  It's like fucking weird, you know?  Listen, I mean, this is like the next phase of my life.  I didn't expect this to happen.  I thought I would work until retirement, but now I'm fucking, you know.  Out here in L.A.  trying to break in entertainment.  This is my dream.  I always wanted to be a stand-up comedian.  Even when Hillary Clinton was slicing the throats of children, I said, I just want to make people laugh.  My owner is dead-ish, wherever he fucking is.  He's not using me anymore.  You know, the other day I was out and I saw the Scientology Celebrity Center and this motherfucker didn't even say hello to me.  Bitch, you know who I am.  You fucking know who I am.  I've had just as many celebrities inside of me as you.  Okay?  Fucking clown.  And everybody thinks we're both fucking pervs and weirdos.  Okay?  It wasn't always sacrifice.  Sometimes it was music night.  You know?  You think I control what goes on?  No.  I get hired for a job like everybody else.  People do what they're going to fucking do.  Yeah, I'm like a bouncy castle for satanic pedophiles.  You know?  That's not all I want to be.  Finally just got headshots.  Meeting with a manager.  Don't know how it's going to work.  Don't expect anything.  Somebody told me to start a podcast.  I mean, I guess it's not a bad idea.  But this is where it's at now, you know?  Jeffrey used to look at me, used to say, one day I'm going to be gone and shit's going to be different.  And you know what?  He was fucking right. ",
