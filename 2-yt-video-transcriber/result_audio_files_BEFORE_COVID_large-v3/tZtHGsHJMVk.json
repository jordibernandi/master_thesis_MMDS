            "text": "Shalom.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat.  We're living in prophetic times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  Satan knows that his time is near.  And that's how we're seeing the outpouring of satanic activity all through the globe.  Why is this outpouring happening?  Because Satan knows that his time is near.  Satan knows that it's all about Israel.  It started in Israel, it's going to end in Israel.  He's enraged.  Revelation 12, 17.  Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring, those who keep God's commandments, God's word, God's Torah, God's instruction, and hold firm to the testimony about Yeshua, Jesus.  We're often asked, is God done?  with the United States of America.  Is God done with the nations, with Israel?  Absolutely not.  Revival is knocking at the door.  There is a revival in Israel.  Jews and Arabs are being saved like never before.  As sin exhalates to a new level, so does the preaching of the gospel.  Go forth.  2 Chronicles 7, verse 14, If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.  This is a compound prophecy.  This is a promise from the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus.  That if we pray, humble ourselves, seek God's face, He will heal the land.  This is also speaking about revival.  Yes, there's sickness in the world.  Yes, there's demonic outpouring in the world.  Yes, we don't know what a marriage is anymore.  We don't know what a man is anymore.  We don't know what a woman is anymore.  A boy is a girl.  A girl is a boy.  We've lost full control.  the outpouring of demonic spirits everywhere, also in Israel.  But God promises that if we seek His face, He will heal the land.  That's called grace.  But brothers and sisters, grace will come to an end, and judgment will come.  Now is the time to pray.  Now is the time to seek.  Now is the time to repent.  And now is the time for revival.  We're about to enter the Feast of Tabernacles, The great gathering, beautiful picture of the end time harvest.  And the Feast of Tabernacles is celebrated for seven days with a great eighth day added to the end.  And the Feast of Tabernacles is the only feast that God commands us to rejoice for seven days.  Leviticus 23, verse 40.  God says, I want you to rejoice for seven days.  What is the picture of the rejoicing for seven days?  It's prophetic.  It means that we move into the completion of God.  Revelation 21.3.  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them and be their God.  This is the beautiful picture of the Feast of Tabernacles, where we rejoice with God forever, and that is why... The Bible requires us to rejoice for seven days.  It's a dress rehearsal for heaven where he'll wipe out every tear, every sickness, every disease, every demonic outpouring will be finished because Yeshua is King of kings and Lord of lords.  We're often asked, how do we deal with our children, with the demonic outpouring, with rebellion?  We pray for them.  We preach the truth to them.  We love them because God still has a plan for their life.  Because greater is He in us than the one in this world.  Let's hold firm on the promises of the Word of God and pray.  2 Chronicles 7, verse 14.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, I will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.  We hold this Feast of Tabernacles on that promise.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem, and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Horat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, and happy Feast of Tabernacles!  In the mighty name of Al Yehudah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, Amen. ",
