            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we return to talking about the cast of the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe comic book movie, Avengers Endgame.  Particularly, we're going to talk more about how it seems like a lot of the cast is not a big fan of Brie Larson, aka the actress playing Captain Marvel.  Last time we went over her in some of her interviews, where Chris Hemsworth, the actor who plays Thor, well, he was clearly not liking how cocky, arrogant, and self-centered Larson was being.  That's why Chris started calling her out in the interview, trying to put Brie Larson back in her place.  Which is probably the kid.  First, she was saying how her character is the strongest of all, which Hemsworth quickly rebuked, as he should.  His character is, in fact, much stronger.  And then, later, Larson even tried to brag about doing her own stunts in the movies.  Chris eventually called her on this, too, saying, what?  Do you think you're Tom Cruise or something?  Tom Cruise, of course, is another actor who is known for doing his own stunts.  a feat which he pushes himself to do to make his movies more realistic and exciting.  Larson, on the other hand, does it so she can brag about it, and so she could try and look cool and better than everyone else in interviews like this, even though her self-done stunts really don't add much to the kinds of movies she's in.  Furthermore, since this Chris and Brie interview started trending, Some people have been pointing out the fact that Larson's claim isn't even entirely true.  Here you can see she clearly has a stunt double in this picture.  So I don't know if it was just for one shot or scene or something, but obviously she's not doing all of her own stunts.  Not if we can so easily find pics of her with stunt doubles around.  It's also worth noting that there were rumors back in January that Marvel had to hire a butt double for Brie, because she has a flat ass.  I covered that part of her story in my first Captain Marvel video back then, and while it's not a stunt double per se, it's still pretty interesting and also kind of hilarious.  But it wasn't just Chris Hemsworth who was giving Brie Larson a pushback.  War Machine actor Don Cheadle was also in the room during that same interview, and he also threw some shade at Brie at that time too.  As you can see from this clip we went over before, Don was not into Brie touching him and asking for encouragement at the time.  Let's go ahead and take a look at this clip again real quick so you know what I'm talking about. ",

And what this all says to me is, like what I said in our last Avengers video, Brie Larson must have really been getting on these guys' nerves because this kind of resentment means a lot, especially coming from them, Chris Hemsworth and Don Cheadle, two very likable guys who seem to get along with everyone, but apparently, that's not the case with the very unlikable Brie Larson.  But that's only the beginning, guys.  We've got loads of more Brie Larson cringe to go over today, including a very awkward Audi commercial she did in character as Captain Marvel.  But before we get to that, let's talk about yet another Avengers actor who appears as if they can't stand Brie Larson.  Recently, another interview of hers went viral, and this time it was her with Jeremy Renner, the actor who plays Hawkeye, the bow and arrow shooting Avenger.  And well, just like with Hemsworth and Cheadle, Jeremy Renner also appears to not be a big fan of Brie Larson.  So, Let's go ahead and take a look at that interview now so you guys can see what I'm talking about. ",

If you did, you would stop acting like a self-centered narcissist who thinks they're better than everyone.  And I think it's time to fire your fashion designer too, girl.  Damn.  Just look at this big and silly blouse she's wearing here.  Reminds me of that Puffy Shirt episode of Seinfeld.  The one where he wears this ridiculous shirt in a TV interview or something, and he gets ragged on for it.  Looks like a shirt a pirate would wear or something.  Not a good look, Brie, and this isn't a one-time screw-up for her either.  Back to that last interview with Thor again for a second, and you can see she's wearing this pantsuit thing that makes her look like a nanny or a lawyer or something.  And then there's another interview here by herself where she looks even worse.  Just look at how hideous that studded leather jacket is on her.  Yikes.  But back to the interview with Jeremy Renner now.  Before we move on, let's keep an eye on the body language here.  Brie is open and she keeps looking over to Renner for encouragement, but... Jeremy is not having it.  He's turned away, looking off to the side, and he also will not look over to Brie at all.  So, yeah, this first 30 seconds says a lot already, and we're only getting started. ",

Renner just said he doesn't want to use his celebrity status as a platform for other issues and, of course, we all know Brie Larson does just that.  And not only that, but Brie started pushing her anti-white male SJW bullshit right away, the first chance she had to do it, which came when she was cast as Captain Marvel and the press started coming out for it earlier this year.  Jeremy Renner, on the other hand, he's been part of the MCU since Thor came out in 2011.  And over the last nine years, he's never done anything political or stupid like Brie Larson.  And that's why we all still love the guy.  Jeremy's great.  And also, this is why we hate Brie Larson so much. ",

            "text": "Absolutely.  Yeah, you can really see the difference in priorities here now.  Brie answered the question talking all about herself, her mistakes, and how she grows and improves from them.  Stupid platitudes like that.  Basically, Brie's humble bragging, saying she's not perfect, she's a human who makes mistakes and then learns from them.  And this to me sounds fake, like probably.  Brie does actually think of herself as perfect and not making many mistakes.  She just says otherwise to try and sound humble, but now it's coming across as the opposite.  Jeremy Renner, on the other hand, doesn't make his answer about him at all.  He says he doesn't want to use his fame as a platform for personal interests, like what Larson does.  And also, Renner makes this about the audience, particularly the kids who watch and enjoy his movies.  It's not about him.  It's about them and us.  Cool.  And frankly, this is how actors should be.  They need to step back and recognize that the audience and the people who support them They're the ones who matter in this industry, perhaps more than in many others.  But Brie is too self-centered to realize this, so she continues to make it all about her, as we can see.  And also, she even has the lady balls to insult and belittle parts of her audience, like when she bashes men and white people, like what we've seen before. ",

            "text": "Now's a good time for me to admit this, too.  Despite all this drama with Captain Marvel and Brie Larson and silly interviews and stuff, I, too, cannot wait to see Avengers Endgame this weekend.  I literally can't be any more excited for this movie.  I love all the Marvel movies, even including Captain Marvel itself.  It wasn't my favorite, sure, but it was good and watchable, and it expanded the universe somewhat, adding some new characters even.  And I would have liked it a lot more if it wasn't filled with SJW feminist bullshit, but that stuff was pretty subtle and nothing that would ruin the whole movie.  Brie Larson's shitty public persona almost did ruin it, though.  She leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth, that's for sure.  And clearly, as we've seen in video after video, Brie is not very good at these press interviews.  I know she's trying, but every time she opens her mouth, she seems to make things worse.  I'm surprised they keep letting her run her mouth like this.  Marvel should keep her away from interviews or something.  And well, there you have it.  That about wraps up yet another awkward and cringy interview for Brie Larson.  You know you're doing something wrong when three great, likeable guys like Hemsworth, Cheadle, and Renner all don't appear to like you.  And this is all happening in public interviews too.  It's not like they're acting catty behind the scenes or in their private lives.  This was all on camera and the Avenger guys were so pissed at Brie and her arrogant ways that they had to throw all this shade on her.  Finally, before we go today, let's get to that Audi commercial I mentioned before.  It's not uncommon for movies to have promotions and product tie-ins like this, so Avengers Endgame having one isn't completely surprising.  What is interesting is they went with Captain Marvel as the hero for their ad when they had so many other better choices.  Iron Man probably wouldn't do it, but I'll bet Thor or Hulk would have been down.  Or you could get Scarlett Johansson if you really want a hot chick to do it, but no.  Now we're getting more Captain Marvel, a character no one likes and a character no one asked for in the first place.  But come to think of it, I do think I know why Audie chose her though.  We've actually covered ads from this company before because Audie, much like Brie Larson, they both love getting woke and virtue signaling, as you'll soon see.  So without further ado, let's go ahead and check out the commercial. ",

But actually, I think they could have used a guy in here because these chicks may be trying to crack jokes, but they're certainly not funny.  I guess the premise is this other chick is trying to get Captain Marvel up to date and caught up with modern times or something.  Since, you know, her movie took place in the 90s and Captain Marvel hasn't been back to Earth since then.  But I never really liked that premise in the first place.  The whole point seems to be that the Avengers lost to Thanos in the last movie, Infinity War.  So now Captain Marvel is coming back to save the day.  Like some kind of feminist SJW messiah or something.  And needless to say... I'm not a fan of that at all.  Really, I'd rather see the remaining Avengers come together and save the day with some kind of new idea or teamwork thing.  Sure, bringing in some new characters to help out is cool, but the way they frame it as Captain Marvel saving them all is totally bogus.  And I actually think the movie might not play out that way.  Many have suggested it would be like that, but I predict that once we see it all play out, Captain Marvel might just be a small part of the bigger picture.  Really, I trust the Russo brothers directing Endgame, and I'm pretty sure they know better than to do something that will mess it up. ",

And why is this ad?  two and a half minutes anyway?  I thought commercials were supposed to be 30 seconds or a minute even.  Whatever.  I think you guys get the point here though.  Audi wanted to make yet another woke ad.  So they got two woke actors.  to do it.  Eventually, the other lady shows Captain Marvel her new car, which is an all-electric Audi.  It still needs time to charge though, so Captain Marvel just shoots her laser hands at the car and boom, it's charged and ready to go.  They kind of stole that bit from Shazam though, if you think about it.  I'm pretty sure that Shazam trailer where he shoots lightning at people's phones to charge them, well that came out months ago, if I remember right.  So it looks like Captain Marvel is not only stealing Shazam's name, Shazam used to be called Captain Marvel himself too, before there were copyright issues, but that and also, Brie Larson's Captain Marvel is also stealing a direct joke from the Shazam movie too.  Well done, guys.  In the end, like I said before, I'm still really pumped to see Avengers Endgame, despite all of Captain Marvel's silly SJW and cringy antics.  And while it's not clear yet what sort of role she will play in the new movie, what is very apparent and obvious is that a lot of the Avengers cast, well, they don't really like Brie Larson very much at all.  And that says a lot coming from the three actors we went over today.  Three of my favorite Marvel actors, in fact.  And them hating on.  Larson also reminds me of a Justin Bieber song called Love Yourself.  In that song, there's a lyric that says, my mama don't like you and she likes everyone.  And well, that's kind of how I feel about the cast of the Avengers hating on Larson.  They don't like you, Brie, and they like everyone.  So that really says a lot about you and your attitude.  What do you guys think?  Could even more of the Avengers cast hate Brie Larson if we saw them in other interviews?  What is it that makes her so unlikable to you?  And will you guys be seeing Avengers Endgame this weekend?  I know I'm going to see it.  I already got my tickets.  And if you guys want, I can make more videos about the movie too.  Perhaps another hot take movie review as well.  So if that's what you like, hit that like button and we'll make more.  Let's see if we can get say 5,000 likes and then I'll make a follow up to this video.  Until then though, thanks for watching.  No Bullshit.
