And now we have this fucking crazy threat going on south of fucking the border.  I really think that they probably need to reevaluate doing any business with Mexico until Mexico unfucks itself.  Hello, everybody.  Terrence Popp here with another episode of Live from the Lair.  Alright, what are we going to talk about today?  Oh, that's right.  Got a couple questions in regards to all the bullshit that's going down in Mexico with the drug cartels and the family that just got whacked and the big shootout they had.  Alright, so this is my take on it.  I talked to some people that I know.  who are in the know, and what they're reporting to me is not good.  Now, I cannot, I mean, I haven't been laid on, I'm not in on the circle of any of the fucking super secret squirrel shits.  This is all just, you know, one soldier talking to another soldier and shit like that.  See, in the 80s, we started off with the war on drugs.  It started pretty much down in South America, you know, and it wound up, you know, in Colombia, you know, Bolivia, Brazil, Honduras.  Panama was a real big trafficker in there.  That's one of the main reasons why we jumped into Panama and, you know, fucked up that Noriega, that asshat, the pineapple-faced motherfucker that he is.  And over the past 50 years, we've watched this fucking craziness that's going on down there, or that was going down in just South America slowly march its way up towards the United States.  Okay, so, I mean, there are whole countries in South America that are royally fucked because of the... market for drugs that they sell here in the United States.  now this isn't like you know millions of dollars hundreds of million dollars.  we're talking like hundreds of billions of dollars if not trillions of dollars in fucking drug sales.  all right.  so with that kind of money What can you get?  Well, we just saw it in October of 2019 when the drug cartels went against the Mexican government and police and fought them to a standstill.  Which for the most part hasn't been done in the past in the countries in South America.  I mean, there's been some uprisings and it got really ugly for a while.  But at the end of the day, they were either captured, killed or neutralized.  However you want to phrase that.  But this is going on like right next to our country now.  Mexico, in my opinion, no longer has the ability to police its own borders and repel any enemies, either foreign or domestic, within their fucking country.  And A, because the drug cartels, from what I hear, they've got .50 cal machine guns, Mark 19 automatic grenade launchers.  You know, they have just a myriad of other belt-fed machine guns.  They have anti-tank missiles, light, medium, and heavy.  I mean, literally, I really think that there's been some armed shipments that were supposed to go, you know, to the Middle East.  that got, you know, sidetracked down into drug cartels down south.  So, you got basically a rogue, corrupt, evil... group of individuals just south of our border with enough firepower to neutralize their own country.  And I would venture to guess that they probably have on deck or the ability to have on deck air assets to include fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.  Listen, you take an old Huey, you can put rocket pods on it, a whole assload of machine guns, and you can fuck a lot of shit up.  Okay, now, I've also heard rumors that there are several older-styled, either T-34, T-55, Soviet-era tanks floating around down there.  That's going to be a big problem.  And that one family that just got whacked... It's terrible that that fucking happened.  But it's basically just a symptom of what the fuck's going on.  Now, that family that got whacked, they're Mormons.  They're of a sect.  They're allowed to have polygamy and all their crazy shit.  When the Mormon church clamped down on that shit back in the day, they fled to Mexico.  And they do their deal down there.  Because, you know, Mexico... You can pretty much do whatever the fuck you want.  If you have the money to pay off the judges and the police, then you can have six wives or whatever the fuck you want to do.  All right, now, here's some more craziness.  When I tell you the numbers, you're going to have a real hard time wrapping your head around these.  Let me see where I'm at.  Oh, my two bars.  Okay.  Alright, so between 2007 and 2014, 164,000 individuals have been killed in Mexico in regards to these drug wars that are going on.  Okay, and for those of you that don't know, that is more people killed that all the people killed in Afghanistan and Iraq put together.  You know, some people say that the number in Iraq is more, but if, you know, them killing themselves, I don't know.  That's neither here nor there.  That's a lot of fucking people.  164,000, and they quit counting, you know, in 2014, because they really haven't, Got any current numbers on that?  And as far as I've been able to track down, there's been over 20,000 fucking killed this year alone, and the year's not even done yet.  What the fuck?  We're sending... All of our fucking car business down south to be worked at and some factories down south.  And there's all kinds of craziness going on at the border already.  And now we have this fucking crazy threat going on south of fucking the border.  I really think that they probably need to reevaluate doing any business with Mexico until Mexico unfucks itself.  Or... You know, they let the United States in there.  They start stuffing target folders on these jackasses and make pretty short work of them.  I'm pretty sure the tier one teams, the tier one assets out there could probably make really short work of these guys.  You know, I was watching some of that video footage, and there were some armored trucks which were armed with .50 cal machine guns.  One of them had a quad .50 on it, which is insane.  Rolling around in Mexico, fighting the police and the fucking army.  You would think you'd put an Apache in the air and fucking wipe those people out.  I've seen it done just like that.  They pop like grapes.  But, you know, until they invite us in there or something more egregious happens, I think we're just going to have to fucking grin and bear it.  Now, here's another thing that went down in 2014, because I've been following this for a while.  In 2014, a whole bus with 43 college students on it disappeared.  And no one on that bus has been seen of or heard from again.  And no one can get any fucking answers.  Not to mention a whole crazy amount of fucking people found dead in the fucking desert and all kinds of other crazy shit.  And I think we've looked the other way for such a long time, because for the most part, it was the drug cartels fighting other drug cartels, and it's them feeding on themselves.  So the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  But I think we've graduated to a point where we're now way beyond that.  Yeah, let's see.  There's been some reports of some car bombs that were deployed against the police during the October 2019 fucking fiasco.  I mean, I dealt with the car bomb issues in Iraq all the fucking time.  And I can't tell you how many times I was at my fucking... desk doing my deal and have shit fucking fall off the walls and off the desk from the shockwave of a fucking 2,000 pound car bomb going off at a checkpoint.  Because every time that happens, the people who man the fucking checkpoint are reduced to a pink mist and bones.  If that.  They're basically just road pizza.  That's some pretty scary fucking shit.  Now, I have a feeling that in the next 10 to 20 years, we're going to see that shit happening in the United States.  And I really don't know how we're going to respond to that.  I really don't.  You know, odds are... We'll probably do as we've always done and ignore it for a little while.  Then we'll turn our back on it for a while.  And then sooner or later, they're gonna fucking wake the bear and they're gonna get fucking chowed down, just destroyed.  It's fucking creepy.  And I'm seeing a parallel between the Mexican government, And the shit that's going on right now at our federal level, between our House and our Senate.  Okay, I mean, I find it hard to believe that you get elected to be a senator.  I think they get 250 grand a year in salary.  They show up with maybe $50,000 savings, a house that's almost paid for.  And they leave eight years later with $10 million.  What the fuck is that?  You know, and they're fighting to get Trump's tax returns.  Well, I say he should give them their fucking tax returns if all of the fucking people in the House and all of the Senators, all of their tax returns for the past 20 years get fucking released to the general public as well.  You know, what's good for the goose is good for the fucking gander.  Alright, gentlemen, this is a short one.  Uh... I'm very upset about the whole goddamn thing that's going down there in Mexico because I like Mexican chicks and I like Mexican food.  I used to enjoy going to Tijuana and hanging out at Rosie's and drinking eight ounce glasses of Mascal and pouring myself into a taxi cab and getting dropped off at the border and doing the drunk walk across to my buddy's you know, hotel room or whatever and fucking zonk out for the fucking night and wake up to two IVs in the morning and greasy eggs and throwing up in the toilet.  It was great times.  Can't do that anymore.  As you get older, shit doesn't work the same.  And I wouldn't dare drink that heavy at my age because I don't think I have that many more big drinks in me, if you know what I mean.  But, yeah, my heart's breaking over all the bullshit that's going on down there.  All right, gentlemen, that's me.  Take it fucking easy. ",
