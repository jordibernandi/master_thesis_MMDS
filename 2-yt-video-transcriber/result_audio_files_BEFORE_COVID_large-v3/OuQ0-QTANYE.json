This is what led in part to the crash of 2008.  I'll tell you all about it right here.  And by the way, don't forget to ding the bell, subscribe to our channel, comment if you would like, and share this with your friends.  I wanted to check in with Professor Richard Wolff.

            "text": "It is always so great to have you.  So I read in the Financial Times that China is lowering the reserve requirement for their banks.  And I believe that I've heard that the Trump administration is also trying to roll back reserve requirements on banks.  And then on top of that, yesterday I was reading, I think it was in the Financial Times, how they want to radically roll back the little tiny reserve requirements that Fannie and Freddie have.  Apparently Fannie and Freddie are sitting on something like $6 billion to secure a trillion dollars worth of mortgages, some mind-boggling amounts of numbers.  i don't think most americans even know what a reserve requirement is or what this means and you're so good at translating this econ speak into english.  could you could you tell us what's going on here and and how it ties in with the crash of two thousand eight will do will do okay let's begin with what banks basically do?

            "text": "we the people and businesses put money into the bank for shape keeping for record keeping and all the rest make our payments.  Normally, the banks give us little or nothing for doing so.  But then they take the money we deposit and lend it out.  Take the most extreme example.  We these days put money into a bank, get literally half of 1%, 1%, and the bank turns around and lends that money out to people who use credit cards, charging them in the neighborhood of 16, 17, 18 or more percent.  In short, how banks make a big part of their money is by getting us to give them deposits on which they pay a little, and then turning around and lending that money out at interest rates that earn them a lot with our money.  And the problem has been that banks, who love this arrangement for reasons that should be obvious, have a tendency to lend out Pretty nearly every nickel we give them, because obviously the more of our money they lend out, the fatter the profit they take home.  The big problem here is, if for any reason a large number of us want our deposits back, which, after all, they're ours and we have every right to them, the bank would not be able to give them back to us because they've lent them out.  And that has led periodically to what used to be called, honestly, a bank panic, because people panicked, realizing that they might get to the bank and be told that their deposits could not be and might not ever be returned to them.  In the face of this greedy behavior by banks, the government passed a law requiring reserves to be held by banks.  The reserve requirement is that law.  It says, for example, that for every dollar deposited in a bank, the bank has to keep 20 cents or 18 cents or some percentage in that neighborhood, which it cannot lend out, which it has to keep as a kind of insurance policy.  that in the event depositors want their money back, they will not be in a position of having to say no, causing a panic, causing the whole economy to totter and collapse.  But what that means is every bank has a big bunch of money, the money that they are not allowed to lend out because of this insurance for depositors.  And it's very tempting for a government that wants to stimulate the economy to to lower the reserve requirement, basically telling every bank, you don't have to keep whatever.  we were telling you you had to, say 20%.  We're lowering it to 15%, which means $5 for every $100 that you used to keep as a reserve, you are now free to lend.  And the point of that is to get every bank to begin beating the bushes to get that money into the hands of interest-paying borrowers and thereby stimulate the economy.  That's what China is doing.  And a desperate Mr.  Trump, worried about a recession between now and re-election time in November 2020, is trying to do everything he can, lower interest rates, He even proposed yesterday negative interest rates.  But cutting reserve requirements is typically a more massive kind of stimulus because it isn't the government doing something.  It's literally the government allowing every bank, large and small, to do that. ",

And from what little we have of his financials, it looks like he's sitting on between three and four hundred million dollars in loans just from Deutsche Bank right now.  So if the interest rate, if the Fed fund rates go to zero from where they are right now, doesn't that mean that suddenly Donald Trump doesn't have to pay millions of dollars a year in interest? ",

            "text": "Absolutely.  He will do what we call refinance.  He will borrow money at zero interest, or if he could really engineer this game, he could borrow at a negative interest rate, which means the bank pays him to be a borrower.  That's what negative interest rates mean.  He could borrow money at little or no interest, use it to pay off the loans he now has, which are carrying high interest rates, and it would be a big improvement for his finances and for everybody else who might do that.  Of course, if you lower reserve requirements and you lower interest rates, you are inviting every speculator in the world to see an opportunity because money is now so cheap to borrow, or if it goes to negative, banks will pay you to borrow.  So any wild harebrained scheme you might have been playing with is now a more attractive opportunity than it even was before.  So if we're worried that the kind of crash from irresponsible speculation that we had in 2008 is down the road, cutting interest rates, particularly to negative, and lowering reserve requirements only stimulates even more speculation and the inevitable bursting of that bubble down the road.  But Mr.  Trump and the Republicans clearly don't care.  They are like King Louis XVI in France.  They're going to do what's necessary.  hope to get reelected, and then when the crash comes, we will hear them say, as Louis XVI did, after me comes the deluge, but meanwhile, I'm going to have the ride of my life.

            "text": "we got about two and a half minutes till we hit a hard break okie-doke in the Great Depression it was clear that one of the crazy things going on was that the banks were using the depositors' money to make all of these speculative investments.  Again, remember, they profit if they make a good investment, and they have virtually no expense because we give them our deposits as little or nothing.  So they are very tempted to make these speculative investments, and they did it with our money.  One of the reforms that came out of the Great Depression was to create a wall.  It was called the Glass-Steagall Act, and it basically said the bank cannot use depositors' money for speculative or long-term or risky investments.  If the bank wants to do those investments, it either has to use the money of the people who started the bank, that's called the bank capital, or the accumulated profits, as you just mentioned, or the bank can go into the world of high finance and borrow money from investors.  making it crystal clear and transparent that they are going to speculate with the investors' money, but not with the depositors' money.  When Bill Clinton signed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in the 1990s, that wall of separation came down.  Banks had been evading it for all the usual reasons, mainly to make more profits.  We allow our monetary system to be controlled by people whose first priority is their own profit.  And so they weaken the law, they evade the law, they amend the law.  And with Mr.  Clinton, they were able to basically repeal it.  We are back to square one.  Creative accounting allows banks to mix different kinds of money for all kinds of investments.  That's what they have teams of lawyers, accountants, and economists like me to do.  And they're always incentivized because in the capitalist system we live in, what they pay us for the money we give them is so much less than what they can get by speculating that they would have to be.  every day is Sunday in church kinds of people not to take advantage of that and thereby put the entire financial system at risk.
