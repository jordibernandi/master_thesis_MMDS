I stopped by the Palmetto State Armory booth to check out their new PS9, PSA9, I forget what they're calling it.  That's a really cool gun, but their lead engineer on that pistol was not there to do a breakdown of it.  So we're going to do that tomorrow morning.  So keep an eye out for that video tomorrow.  But Derek Hicks was there, who is the lead engineer of the PSA 5, as well as Leadstar Arms.  So we sat down with him and went over all the features of the new PSA 5, which is going to be released in 2020 sometime.  And we don't have a price yet, but he goes over all the cool features on this gun.  And I'm really looking forward to getting my hand on one of these.  Let's check it out. ",

            "text": "Hey guys, my name is Derek from Leadstar Arms.  We're here to talk a little bit about the PSA 5.  I know this is a burning question on everybody's minds.  Leadstar is building the PSA 5 and the relationship is we're owned by the same capital group.  But we're also a real high engineering firm.  We also do our own machining, anything from CAD to CAM, machining, building, fixturing, in assembly here in Lindstar.  Our resume is four world championships, two world records, and a whole lot of other titles in there, state championships and so on.  To control the cost of this PSA 5, we have to do it all in-house.  So that's where we come in at.  We can take this gun from start to finish.  And you're going to get a much, much better product out of this.  This gun is going to be a legitimate gun.  Some of the features on it.  Excuse me while I unthread.  So here we have the tri-lug adapter.  But if you notice, I have 28 threads.  go right up to the front side.  So now you can pop on a cross washer and you can thread your favorite muzzle device on it.  You can direct thread your suppressor.  You can put the tri-lug adapter back on it and you can put your tri-lug adapter suppressor right on it.  So that's a pretty cool feature actually.  Another quick thing here in the front is we've got an A2 front side post.  which is a really, really good feature.  You don't have the fixed blade side anymore.  So all of our elevation is controlled off the front side post.  And I have in my pocket here a little show and tell.  A2 front side post.  one of the other cool things about it is now you can put in a blitzkrieg components chevron style front sight post.  you can get a tritium dot with orange.  you can get all orange chevron and get a complete tritium chevron.  it's a pretty cool feature to have actually no longer have to paint up the front side posts with orange paint.  other nice thing about having an A2 front sight post is so you control the elevation.  so in the back you no longer have to use the dial operator tool.  that's worth its weight in gold.  to me it is just a click adjustment.  we have a pistol notch so it's on detents.  you click it.  you can change the sight to control windage Loosen the screw, adjust it with a windage screw, lock it back down.  Once again, no diopter tool.  If you really, and I don't know why you'll want to, but if you ever wanted to change it back to the standard diopter style drum, you can do that.  It fits right on the receivers.  Picatinny rail.  No more claw mount tearing up your receiver.  No more extra things to purchase.  It's welded right onto the receiver.  Which allows you to see right through, use your iron sights, use your dot.  Pretty cool.  SP tactical brace.  We have a Magpul grip and a Magpul ambidextrous safety.  That will come standard.  Yeah, I know everybody's burning question.  Yes, it does have a paddle mag release and then the button on the side, but it does have the paddle mag release.  It's going to be right in the gun as it comes.  The trigger, we're partnering with CMC Triggers, and we're going to make a better trigger to go in this.  I've never been a fan of the MB-5 Triggers, so we're going to solve that problem.  And it'll come with a Magpul handguard.  And the one thing important to note here is we're not changing the operating system.  That operating system has worked really, really well for a very long time.  It's very proven.  We're leaving the operating system just like it is.  And the bullhead carrier, full auto rated.  It's already going to have tungsten in it.  If you're ever wanting to switch out, it's got a shelf on it, and you want to switch out, you can put your trigger packs and put an MP5 trigger pack right back in it.  We're not changing any of that.  I don't know why, but, or if you want to put your full auto trigger pack in it, you can do that.  You don't have to modify it for the shelf and stuff, but you can put your full auto trigger pack back in it.  The grip is going to be standard.  And you're going to be able to do an H&K slap.  So, I know the big burning questions.  When's it going to be available?  2020?  it is legitimately coming in 2020. it's happening.  so get ready.  next question price.  everybody wants to know that one too.  the truth of the matter is we're still machining on parts.  we don't have all the true costs.  i know gut feel you're going to be very very happy.  it's going to be better than the closest competitor and you're going to have a whole lot more features associated with it.  And we're also going to have a classic version that's going to come out where it will not have a Picatinny rail, and it'll have the SB Tactical kind of A2 kind of folding kind of brace to go along with it.  Cool.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Thanks very much. ",
