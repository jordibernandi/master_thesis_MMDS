            "text": "All right.  Nasty Nathaniel out here in the city of Los Angeles, East Hollywood to be exact.  And right now I'm going to be conducting a First Amendment audit of Kaiser Permanente, Los Angeles Medical Center.  We're going to make sure that our friends at Kaiser respect and honor my constitutional right to record in public.  So let's shake them up.  So yeah, this is it.  This is Kaiser Permanente.  They own all these buildings that you see here that I'm filming that are in front of me.  This is a huge medical complex.  Consists of several buildings.  I'm on the corner of Sunset and Edgemont.  I'm going to walk around the property, see how they react to my filming.  I don't know if any of you watched my audit that I did with Pink Camera Magic in Chi-Town Sioux at Rush Hospital.  That's in Chicago.  And that was kind of like a pass-fail.  One of the guards wasn't happy with it.  But another guard came out.  I think he was a supervisor and kind of cleared up any misunderstandings that people might have.  Now what happens a lot of times when people try to film hospitals or, you know, urgent cares, clinics, whatever, or even like traffic accidents where there's like paramedics on the scene and they're treating someone, a lot of times they'll try to throw a HIPAA out there or hippo, depending on who you're talking to.  Hey, hippopotamus lotion.  And what do you know?  But yeah, they'll try to show, but yeah, they'll try to throw HIPAA out there and say, oh, you're violating HIPAA.  And I actually used to work for a hospital and HIPAA applies to healthcare professionals.  It doesn't apply to private citizens filming from public view.  Now, of course, if I went inside and started filming, not necessarily saying that would be a HIPAA violation, but it would definitely get hairy.  But I'm not going to go inside.  I'm going to stay out here on the public sidewalk here on Sunset Boulevard and just film what I can see.  You can actually see a lot from the sidewalk, so there's no need to go in and rattle them up.  Sign right there.  lets me know exactly where I'm at.  It even says welcome on it.  Well, let's see how welcome they make me feel.  That looks like the front entrance right there to the main... Hi, good morning.  What's going on?  I'm just filling the hospital.  Do you have authorization?  No, because I'm on a public sidewalk.  As long as I stay on the sidewalk, I can film anything that's in front of me.  Yeah, because it's so like you're focusing on the hospital.  My supervisor is telling me right now.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, I'll be happy to talk to him.  So yeah, this is, as I was saying, this is the front entrance to the main building.  Kaiser is a big medical complex, as I just mentioned.  So let's see how they do.  What are the pictures for?  Huh?  What are you filming for?  I'm for my own personal use.  Anything that has the patients, it's a HIPAA violation.  Yeah, actually, I've filmed many hospitals.  As long as I stay on the public sidewalk, I can... ",

This guy's acting stupid.  Oh, come back.  Come back, folks.  Oh, yeah.  I think this is going to be a fail.  All right.  I got one guard over there.  He's standing there trying to look important.  And then over here, I got another guard trying to look important, keeping an eye on me.  Yeah, there he is.  There's the other guard.  He's keeping an eye on me.  So they're watching me from both sides of the building, like they're surrounding me or something.  starting to feel in fear for my life.  Hi, what are you guys nervous about?  Well, I don't care if you record me.  That's perfectly fine.  Yeah, they're freaking out.  They don't know what to do.  There's a security guard that was hassling me.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  So yeah, like I said, it's a big complex.  Actually, I can.  I can film anything I see in public.  Yeah, that's a First Amendment right.  First Amendment right.  I can film anything I see from a public sidewalk.  Well, I have no plans of filming patients, but anything I can see from public is fair game.  All right, have a good day, sir.  There we go again, trying to play the hippo role.  Ah, security's on me there.  They're freaking out.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, how do they think a cam back is going to do anything?  What, is that going to stop me?  If anything, it's just going to encourage me even more.  Yeah, go back to work, buddy.  So I got the guy, the supervisor or whatever he was, the guy trying to.  Wanted to look at my camera.  He's up here.  And he's not digging it too much.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah, I came back.  I'm really frightened.  Oh my goodness.  Kaiser Permanente folks, security and parking enforcement.  So yeah, over at, on the Vermont side, I guess it's 1515 North Vermont.  There's another sign.  And this is the, I've already been noticed.  Yeah, they're not digging it too much.  They don't like it.  Well, maybe they'll get educated today.  Or at least I tried to.  So yeah, this looks like a parking structure.  I'm at the backside of the property.  This is really making me think of that audit, like I mentioned earlier, that I did with Pink Camera Magic in Chi-Town Sioux in Chicago.  That was a fun one.  Maybe we'll see some ambulances coming in.  I know I saw some fire trucks earlier, but.  Security's over there.  They're freaking out.  They don't know what to do.  Bozo over here.  Learn the law, people.  Learn the law.  Security team here.  They're not happy.  How's it going?  Morning.  Morning.  Well, maybe he understands the law a little bit better.  Maybe somebody educated him.  I don't know.  There's our friend right there.  He's following me around, wasting company gas.  What do you say?  he's going to turn, make a turn?  Probably so.  So over here, this is the urgent care.  Like I said, it's a big complex.  I wonder if this guy knows what's going on.  I would think they would inform each other over the radio.  Hey, we got this weird guy all dressed in black, and he's out here filming, and here we go.  Hi, how are you?  Yeah.  Your security at the hospital?  Well, I think that's a pretty obvious question, but I guess he does.  Just filming, brother.  That's all.  Not here to hurt anybody.  This is the hospital.  Not that I would hurt anybody if it was anywhere else.  There's the guard.  He's still checking me out.  He's on the phone.  Peekaboo, I see you.  Are we on YouTube?  Huh?  Are we on YouTube?  Huh?  Are we on YouTube?  Yeah.  Hey, how's it going?  You work for the hospital or you just... No, I was just doing a little video on the security.  They're freaking out.  They're getting all... So I went live, you know, just because I didn't know if they were going to try to grab me or something.  You know, you got the right to do it.  Yeah, exactly.  You're in public access.  And I even tried to explain to him.  I said, you know, I mean, yeah, I could get into legalities or whatnot.  But I said, my focus is not on the patients.  I'm not here to film patients or kids or anything.  But you're on the street.  Yeah, exactly.  You're a reporter, videotaper.  I think they figured it out, but they're still following me around.  So I'm going to head out here pretty soon.  All right, man.  Good luck, man.  All right, thank you.  Hey, have a good day.  What are you on?  Huh?  What are you on?  There's some different channels.
