And more than being mere witnesses to history, you begin to realize that we are all active participants in one of the greatest stories that will ever be told.  Hi, I'm Neon Revolt, and yes, this is what I actually sound like.  And today I want to talk to you about this book I wrote called Revolution Q, the story of QAnon and the Second Great Awakening.  I've written close to 500 articles on the subject of Q now, documenting every wave and ripple along the way.  But as things have continued to grow and swell, I realized more articles simply wouldn't suffice for the task we have ahead of us.  We needed another resource, another tool to get this job done.  Articles and social media are great tools.  But for this, we needed something more permanent, something you could physically put into the hands of someone and tell them, here, read this.  The Q Movement needed a book.  And not just any book, but the definitive book on QAnon.  Why?  Because a storm is coming.  As longtime QAnon followers, we've had the luxury of having the past two years to digest and process all the information that's about to break out into the public sphere.  But the average person will not share that same luxury.  They will be hurt, angry, confused, and in need of answers.  I wrote this book for them.  I wrote this book to help bring all searching souls up to speed with QAnon and the now over 3,000 posts he's made over the past two years.  I've taken over 400 pages to explain in all necessary detail what Q is about and what must come to pass if we intend to preserve peace, freedom, and prosperity for all future generations.  But if you're someone who has been following Q since the beginning, don't worry.  This book is jam-packed with fresh information too.  Information that will give you a more robust understanding of Q, this movement's history, the origins of the cabal, and much, much more.  If you ever struggle to explain Q to a friend as you try to unpack the sprawling web of information Q presents, this book is for you too.  I wrote this book to capture this amazing chapter in our nation's history and make sure that it's preserved for generations to come.  And now, I need your help to make sure this message gets out into the real world.  Help me bring this book to the masses.  Visit neonrevolt.com.  slash revolutionq to order today. ",
