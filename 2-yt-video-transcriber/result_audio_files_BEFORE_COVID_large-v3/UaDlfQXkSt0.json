The round ends here, widely dominated by David Rodr\u00edguez.  There is the left, Ricardo.  Left hook.  shaking the head of his rival again.  the left here with the technology of the phantom.  we clearly appreciate the impact on the part of the mexican dominated very well this sixth episode connecting strong.
