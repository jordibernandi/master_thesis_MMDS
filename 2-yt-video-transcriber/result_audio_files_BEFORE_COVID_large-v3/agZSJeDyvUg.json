            "text": "Black Ram 313 back at it again.  You know why?  It's because this is therapeutic, man.  Back again with another video, hence another therapy session.  Today's topic and title is the thought retirement plan.  Many companies offer their employees a plan in which they could put aside money, put aside money for 20, 30 and sometimes 40 plus years of savings, if you will.  One in which would allow them to receive payment, receive a paycheck well after their working days are over.  A retirement plan in any company worth its weight would definitely have one for its employees.  But I'm here to say that the thought is provided the same benefits by the system in which we now live.  Now, let me start by introducing her strategy, a thought strategy.  Talk to her by her mama who says, Girl, how do you know what you like if you only just deal with one guy?  You young have your fun, girl.  Now, her mother promotes the carousel riding, the Hennessy drinking with the cat stinking.  Now, the average succubus, she starts to date in quotes in high school.  And she loses the V to the first boyfriend and then breaks up with him and dates two to three guys afterwards.  And by the time the prom rolls around, she has a whole new dude.  And of course, after the prom, she promptly get rid of him when the college semester begins.  So by 18, she goes to college, rides the carousel and she does it all here.  She gains her experience and it's here where she turns pro.  Now, this puts between five to 10 bodies or more on her during this time.  Moderately speaking, after college graduation in her early 20s, she's heavily into the club scene.  At this point in time, she's riding a carousel very hard.  No pun intended.  She's in the party life, having her fun while she's young.  Just like Mama said.  And here is where the one-nighters and all the depravity occurs.  Here, it's a free fall of about 10 or more bodies, moderately speaking.  By age 27, she's still dating, racking up many bodies here in the process.  She calls this dating, which really is carousel riding.  And she does this until she finds the one, the one in which her God resides.  has for her.  she says she has to kiss many frogs to get to her prince in which such a statement is only euphemistic of being a thought in this time.  at this age.  this lasts from about 27 to about 35 and in the process of these years she may have three long-term boyfriends on average and each lasting about one to two years Between the ages again of 27 and 35.  But here in this age range is where it gets dirty.  The time in between these relationships, she's single, but dating.  And here she dates between seven and 12 guys per year.  And she's probably intimate with at least.  Four of those guys each year when she calls herself being single, moderately speaking.  It's in this area of life where she racks up about 20 plus bodies at this age, not including the boyfriends.  The boyfriends serve as a break.  The boyfriends are just a break between carousel rides.  A resting period of about a year or two.  And then she gets off of that rest and she's back onto the carousel.  Again, the boyfriends are just carousel breaks.  So then at this point, she's 36 years old and her total body count is 44.  Moderately speaking, of course, we know those whose number is exponentially more.  Now, she gave all 44 of those guys more than likely the cucumber special.  And by the way, she'd love to kiss.  Oh, yeah, I like kissing.  And she will be kissing you with that mouth.  And she will be kissing your kids on the cheek with that same mouth, too.  After 44 cucumber specials.  And I bet you a drink after her, too.  So now at 36, she plans to retire.  Now, the simp will call this act maturity.  But thinking, man, we know that this is the wall here.  This is her last opportunity to find someone to nest with, to find someone to raise offspring with.  And sometimes or I should say many times to raise the offspring that she has with other males at this time.  Now, the guy who deals with this self-damaged fee fail after this age or at this age is her thought retirement plan.  Oh, wait, you say it's not you.  Really?  You're not her thought retirement plan?  Hmm.  Well, here are a few signs that will indicate that you are the retirement plan for the thought.  A few signs that we know it's you.  Signs that we can know that you rescued her from the carousel.  Number one, got kids?  If she answers in the affirmative, If she has Thuggo's babies, then you are her retirement plan.  If she's over 30, then yes, bubba, odds are you are her retirement plan.  Did she used to date Thuggo and them?  If the answer is yes, then you are.  The retirement plan is her body count over three.  Then, oh, yes, you are the retirement plan.  If you are looking at her pictures from when she was in high school and you cannot recognize her, then you are the retirement plan.  If she makes you wait and demands a date before you bunker bus.  Shout out to Solo TV 84.  But she did not require that of the past of 44 gentlemen that she has dealt with.  Then chances are, oh, yes, you just may be her retirement plan.  Number seven, if she demands marriage.  Something that she didn't demand of any other guy to get to the dirty, rotten box.  Now you must wife her up after the 44 dudes didn't have to.  What type of guy does that make you?  Oh yes, that makes you her retirement plan.  But remember, That she just might be on a break from carousel riding with you.  Yeah, you want to walk her down the aisle.  Yeah, you want to give her the ring.  She wants to wear the white dress.  You want to buy the cake.  You want to go on the honeymoon.  You want to go on that vacation.  But are you?  The question remains, are you just that break?  And I know you don't believe that you may be that break because you say she's mature at 35 and 40.  But then you have to think, why is it that so many of them are over those ages and are still single?  Having had husbands and boyfriends galore again, her relationships with the hubby and the boyfriend is just a break.  from the carousel see the thought thinks that she's michael jordan coming out of retirement to see how many thought championships she can win.  you're just a break from the carousel.  she will seek to get back on.  so again the question is she on break with you?  have you or are you playing to wife her up?  is she the one baba?  will you be the first man to do what has never been done in all of human history.  Will you be the first man To turn up into a housewife.  Think about it.  The average succubus has about 44 bodies, moderately speaking, but many have many more.  But even if it's 10, 15, 20 or 30, is that your wife?  Now, there can be exceptions if she's truly, truly repentant and sorrowful.  But how often is that?  Remember, she wants you to be the rest haven.  She wants you to be the brick from the carousel so that she can go back to writing.  So what are you doing?  What are you doing?  wifing her up?  Are you trying to put together broken pieces?  Sometimes things are just better left to go in the trash.  Like the video?  Subscribe to the channel.
