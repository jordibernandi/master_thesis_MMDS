            "text": "Recently we Star Trek fans got some bad news, namely the death of Aaron Eisenberg.  Aaron was only fifty and had dealt with health problems related to his kidneys for his entire life.  He was best known to us for playing Nog on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  Since the show ended in 1999, Aaron had been a frequent presence at conventions, hosted and guested on podcasts, and participated memorably in the DS9 documentary What We Left Behind, where he opened up about what the series and the character he played meant to him.  And the thing is, that character meant a lot to many of us, too.  So, in memory of Aaron, I thought it would be a good idea to take a few minutes to remember why Nog is actually pretty awesome.  We meet Nog in the very first episode of Deep Space Nine, Emissary.  He's the nephew of Quark.  His father, Rom, is Quark's meek, bumbling brother.  Nog is crucial to what turns out to be one of the most important scenes of that first episode.  He's caught attempting to steal something on the promenade, and that's when we meet Odo, the station's shape-shifting chief of security.  This scene also introduces Quark, who appears to ask that Nog be released into his custody so that they and the rest of the Ferengi can leave the station.  Sisko's like, nah, I think I'll let Odo arrest him.  And Odo's like, want me to torture him?  I can torture him, find out what he knows.  And Sisko's like, wow, you are severe in the early episodes, aren't you?  No, man, just put him in a cell.  With oxygen.  and a non-electrified floor.  Later on, Sisko and Odo meet with Quark, who is like, seriously, we're leaving, let my nephew go.  Who knows when I'll find someone else to do so much unpaid labor?  And Sisko says, I'll drop the charges and let Nog go if you agree to stay on the station and keep your bar open, to encourage the other business owners on the promenade to stick around too, cause Starfleet just took over the station, and if everyone leaves right away that's gonna look real bad on my performance review, it could be years before I'm promoted to captain.  And Quark agrees, and they release Nog.  For the rest of Deep Space Nine's first season and into the second, Nog's appearances center on his friendship with Commander Sisko's son Jake.  Initially, Nog plays the role of the bad influence.  Commander Sisko doesn't approve of Jake's friendship with Nog, the two of them are always getting into trouble, Odo's constantly chasing them away from their favorite spot on the second level of the promenade where they like to sit and watch the babes.  At this point in the series, Nog was a solid recurring supporting character.  He was mostly a foil for Jake and occasionally Commander Sisko, but he got to develop a bit on his own as well.  We saw indications that he was capable of growing beyond the gross misogyny that is typical of Ferengi men, for example, which was nice.  He was a strong member of DS9's large and growing ensemble.  He had relationships with other important characters on the show.  He was funny and interesting thanks to Eisenberg's comedy chops and impressive ability to simultaneously project duplicity and vulnerability.  But in the show's third season, Nog's character arc started to bend in a new and unexpected direction.  The B-plot of Season 3's episode Heart of Stone features Nog announcing his intention to attend Starfleet Academy and trying to convince Commander Sisko to sponsor his application.  The A-plot is about Kira getting trapped in a cave and Odo finally spilling his guts about his feelings for her, except it turns out that Kira is really \u2013 no, I won't spoil it, just in case you haven't seen that episode.  But why haven't you seen that episode?  It's a really good episode!  Anyway, Sisko is suspicious of Nog's wish to join Starfleet.  He doesn't get it.  Why would a Ferengi want to work for the Federation?  They don't get paid!  They don't even have money!  Except, when they do, he snatches hold of Nog and goes full\u2026 No, not full, maybe three-quarters.  He snatches hold of Nog and goes, three-quarters Avery Brooks on him, and is like, tell me the truth!  And then Sisko and Nog have this wonderful scene where Nog breaks down and confesses that he wants to join Starfleet so he doesn't end up like his father.  See, it turns out Rom isn't the hapless doofus he appears to be.  I mean, mostly he is, but he has a gift for mechanics.  Nog even says Rom could have been the chief engineer of a starship, only he never got the opportunity.  Those skills aren't valued in Ferengi society, so Rom went to work for Quark at the bar and has spent most of his life half-heartedly chasing profit because that's what's expected of a good Ferengi.  And Sisko is moved by Nog's confession.  His attitude toward Ferengi hasn't been super positive up to this point \u2013 Quark even calls him out on it at the end of season two.  But now, through Nog, Sisko sees that Ferengi aren't all the same.  There's a cultural mold that Ferengi are socially pressured to fit into, but Nog and Rom can't be the only ones who long to break free of that mold and do their own thing.  It opens Sisko's eyes.  So this one scene, which again is part of its episode's subplot, alters the trajectories of two characters, Nog and Rom, forces our lead character, Sisko, to reexamine a prejudice he holds, and adds some much-needed nuance to Ferengi as a species.  And Deep Space Nine did this kind of thing all the time.  Nog is just one example of it, but he might be the best example.  Those of you who aren't into DS9, who don't get why some of us consider it far and away the best part of the Star Trek franchise, this is it.  This is the reason!  The writers of Deep Space Nine use Nog to demonstrate that people don't have to be defined by where they come from, that given the opportunity \u2013 and that part is important \u2013 they can do what they want to do and go as far as their ability and determination and good fortune can carry them.  During the Dominion War, Cadet Nog is promoted to Ensign.  In the sixth season episode, Valiant, he and Jake find themselves aboard a Defiant-class ship, crewed by a squad of elite cadets who took over the ship when the regular officers were all killed in action.  Initially, Nog, who looks up to these cadets, is honored to join the crew, but eventually he realizes that the other cadets have had their judgment clouded by mindless devotion to Captain Waters, who is himself just a cadet.  And if there's any lesson to be taken from this episode, it's that a cadet should never, ever be given command of a starship.  Anyway, Nog acts heroically, but also learns that duty and obedience have to be balanced by reason and self-awareness.  Sometimes being a good officer is just as bad as being a good Ferengi.  It's worse, really, because you could die.  The writers of Deep Space Nine also use Nog to break our hearts.  Nog continues to serve on the front lines of the Dominion War.  During the Siege of AR-558, depicted in the Season 7 episode imaginatively titled The Siege of AR-558, Nog is wounded and winds up losing his leg.  The leg is replaced by a biosynthetic prosthetic, but Nog has trouble adjusting.  To deal with his trauma, or rather to avoid dealing with it, Nog takes up residence in one of the hollow suites, living and working with sentient holographic lounge singer Vic Fontaine in Vic's recreation of 1960s Las Vegas.  For the first time, we see Nog acting like a typical Ferengi, helping Vic manage his finances and making plans to build a new casino.  Nog grows so attached to life with Vic, and so bitter toward the outside world, that he considers resigning from Starfleet.  But with help from Vic and Esri Dax, he eventually leaves the holodeck and returns to duty.  He serves through the end of the war, and in the series finale is promoted from ensign to lieutenant junior grade, one of Captain Sisko's final acts before vanishing to the Celestial Temple.  We see Nog move from idealism to the loss of innocence, through post-traumatic stress brought on by war and injury, to emerge scarred but stronger on the other side.  I've said before that Captain Sisko is the most complete character in Star Trek, because we see him in so many different roles throughout the series \u2013 father, son, widower, husband, commander, friend, outsider, role model, non-believer, prophet.  But I think Nog has the most complete and significant arc of any character in the franchise.  All you have to do is contrast his appearance in the first episode of the series with his appearance in the last episode, to see how much he grows over the course of those seven seasons.  He begins as a junior version of a stereotypical Ferengi, settles in as Jake's ne'er-do-well best friend, and ultimately comes to embody all the best qualities of a Star Trek hero.  This is a very common type in Star Trek \u2013 the non-human character who represents the best of humanity, who shows us how we ought to be.  Every Star Trek show has at least one of that character \u2013 Classic Trek has Spock.  Next Gen has Data, and also Worf eventually.  Besides Nog, DS9 has Odo, and also Worf eventually.  Voyager has the Doctor in Seven of Nine, technically human but Borgified.  Enterprise has T'Pol and Phlox.  Discovery has Saru.  But of all those characters, only Nog grows into that role.  He isn't the officially designated not-human-but-also-most-human character when the series begins.  He doesn't seem destined for anything special, actually.  But because he was part of a series that was made to be surprising and dynamic rather than a likable but static show, Nog is able to develop, to mature, to acquire complexity and nuance as he goes along, to change more and in more compelling ways than any other character in Star Trek.  And, yeah, the writers deserve a lot of credit for that.  But so does this guy.  Michael Piller, Ira Stephen Bear, Ronald D. Moore, and the other writers on DS9 created Nog, but Aaron Eisenberg brought him to life.  Aaron created something through his performance that enabled the writers to glimpse the potential that was there for that character, and gave them the confidence to explore it.  After DS9 ended its run, Aaron Eisenberg appeared on Voyager playing the young Kazon Karr, who captures Chakotay in the episode Initiations, and he's good in that.  But he'll be remembered for Nog.  And that's as it should be, because Nog is a creation any actor could be proud of.  Over seven years and forty-five episodes \u2013 and by the way, can you believe that?  Nog only appears in forty-five of DS9's 173 episodes.  But what an impression he leaves.  In those 45 episodes, Aaron plays Nog with charm, with wit, with pathos, and with fragile, moving, unmistakable humanity.  He truly is one of the great characters not just of Deep Space Nine, but of Star Trek.  And during the 1990s, I dare say he was one of the great characters on all of television.  That's a hell of a legacy to leave behind.  I only wish he didn't have to leave us quite so soon.  Rest in peace, Aaron.  Hey folks, well, that was an unscheduled special Trek, Actually episode.  Aaron Eisenberg actually died while I was in production of last week's Trek, Actually episode.  It had already been scripted, and I think I had already shot it and was in the editing process when I learned that Aaron Eisenberg had died, so I couldn't include a mention of him in that episode, but I wanted to do a separate special video about Aaron and about Nog, because he really was a special part of the Star Trek franchise.  His character was just so phenomenal, and I know a lot of people knew him and had met him because he was so accessible and was so active on the convention circuit and online through social media, and a lot of people knew him or felt like they knew him.  as more than just the guy who played Nog, and he will be missed.  He will be missed by a lot of people, so I felt like it was only right and only fitting to mention him, so the next Trek Actually video after this one now will be the Eugenics Wars one, but I wanted to slide this one in sort of in between the last one and the next one because I felt like it was important to make mention of Aaron and to pay tribute to him, so... That's what this was, sorry for shaking up the schedule a little bit, but you know what?  Let's do something in the comments.  If any of you have an Aaron Eisenberg story or a Nog story or a favorite Nog moment from the show, please, let's share them in the comments of this video and come together and sort of appreciate the work that Aaron Eisenberg did and the wonderful creation that Nog was on Deep Space Nine.  Linked in the description is a GoFundMe page that was set up on behalf of Aaron's wife, Melissa.  They have reached their funding goal, and I think they've gone three times over their initial funding goal, but it was set up to help cover funeral expenses and lingering costs that I know any of you who have gone through something like this before, the unexpected death of a loved one, especially if it was after an illness and there are medical expenses to take care of.  You know how it can pile up.  I think they've got enough, but just in case any of you want to pay your respects in that way to Aaron and his family, and you want to contribute to the fundraiser, it is linked in the description of this video, so please feel free to donate to help Aaron's wife and his family cover his expenses and just show them some support in this difficult time.  So that's linked in the description.  And other than that, That's it.  Just kind of a short post-show this time.  Just wanting to say we appreciate Aaron Eisenberg and we appreciate the work he did and what he added to Star Trek because what he added to Star Trek was considerable.  And we all really appreciate it and I think he will be deeply missed.  So on that note, thanks for watching and I'll see you next time. ",
