And in other ways, you know, well, yeah, a bit.  So and also, I know Emma has been really outspoken against Tulsi Gabbard.  So, I mean, it just seems like there's also, you know, this sort of MSNBC influence happening in the Young Turks.  And I just thought I thought I'd ask you if you had any kind of take on that or just any kind of insight you might be able to provide. ",

            "text": "You know, all I can tell you is that when I started doing this show called Aggressive Progressives, because the main show took a editorial turn, right?  So it was after the primer, after they decided Bernie wasn't viable anymore, they went full speed, 100% Hillary, and they had a segment called Loser Donald.  So they would bash Donald Trump.  And it just... So that was the impetus for Steve O and I, who was the COO of the company, to start a show called Aggressive Progressives as kind of a counter-narrative to the editorial direction of the main show.  And I thought it would be good.  We'd be complimentary, right?  So we would point out, you know, everybody has blind spots or whatever.  Here's what we think.  Here's what they... And I thought it would be a good thing.  And then I thought that our reporting would... you know, would expose things and people would see and go, Oh, I didn't know this.  And, and it would change, uh, how they did what they were doing.  That didn't happen.  It did.  It turns out that, you know, my effort to shine a light on contrary, uh, narratives of Russiagate was not, it was, um, you know, it just created not a good environment.  It wasn't welcomed.  Uh, and I get that.  I, I, I understand.  Uh, um, And so that, that's all I can say is that I was hoping that my reporting, uh, so do you know anyone who else who won an award doing their reporting on Russiagate?  I don't know anybody besides Aaron Mate.  And we had Aaron Mate on our show constantly and we, we would bring him on.  I bring him on aggressive progressives on the, when I was in the young Turk studio, I bring him on this show and we would debunk all the bullshit of Russiagate.  And it wasn't hard to do.  And, uh, So I just it's it's weird.  We got it right.  A hundred percent right.  And I think you've got right.  A hundred percent right.  And and I thought that would be more appreciated.  That's all I was looking for.  And it wasn't.  So that's all I can tell you now.  You know, the way they've their editorial direction.  I mean, I can't speak to that.  I don't know why.  I can't tell you why they've taken the editorial direction they've taken or why they do what they do.  That's up to you.  I mean, you watch it and make your own decisions.  But I was real proud of the work we did at Aggressive Progressives.  We debunked the Russiagate on a weekly basis.  We debunked the poor Venezuela coverage.  We debunked the gas attacks in Syria.  We were way ahead of everybody on all this stuff.  And I did it.  I did a lot of it in the in the T.Y.T.  newsroom on aggressive progressives.  And again, Aaron Mate won an award for that kind of reporting.  Of course, they can't give an award to a jag off comedian who says, fuck every other sentence.  So they gave it to Aaron Mate because he had the imprimatur of the Nation magazine.  So but again, like I said, Aaron Mate is such a generous guy and such a solid dude.  That he said he shares that award with our show.  So I'm going to accept it.  How about that?  Go ahead and accept that.  So here we were doing award winning journalism on stuff like Venezuela and stuff like Russiagate and stuff like Julian Assange.  and debunking everybody in the mainstream news media.  And so I'm really proud of the work we did there.  And it was disheartening to me.  I thought that if I kept doing good work and I kept showing the debunking of Russiagate, that eventually everybody would catch on.  That didn't happen.  It was heartbreaking for me.  And that's all I can tell you. ",
