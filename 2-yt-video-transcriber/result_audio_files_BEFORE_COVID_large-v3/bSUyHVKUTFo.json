That is what we need.  And our next speaker embodies these twin imperatives with every word that she speaks and every choice that she makes.  Please join me in welcoming Greta Thunberg.  So you've been here for a little bit more than a week now.  Do you have any observations to share after having been here for a little while about some of the differences? ",

You're telling them that they should be listening to scientists.  researcher and writer about climate change myself, I'm always struck that your speeches are so careful and could easily be footnoted with all of the best scientific reports.

I mean, this is just an incredible advanced level education that you've given yourself on the fly and under so much scrutiny because very, very quickly you've become really the most prominent voice of the climate movement, and that is a really heavy responsibility.  I wanted to ask you about this other responsibility that you've taken on which has to do with being very public from the beginning about being on the autism spectrum.  that leads to a whole other level of responsibility because you're probably also the most prominent person in the world right now who self-identifies as being i'm sorry being on the autism spectrum and that's really really important to people who um identify.  So how have you navigated that?  How have you decided to be so public?  It's left you open to terrible attacks.  How have you made these decisions? ",

I can't, for example, understand that someone can say like, yeah, climate change is very important, and then not do anything about it.

I don't know how many laugh attacks I have had just watching these tweets.  And sometimes I have like a competition with myself to find the most absurd conspiracy theory.  Because they go after things like my personality and how I am, how I look, how I behave.  And that is just a sign that you are winning and that they don't have any more arguments to go after you.  Because, I mean, I'm not the enemy, at least I hope not.  But many people seem to think that.  But they cannot argue against, because I'm only saying what the science is saying, and you can't argue against physics.  If there's a fire there, and I say... it's a fire that we need to put it out.  We need to put that fire out.  It's like the most reasonable reaction would be that you look at the fire and say like, we need to put it out.
