So glad we've almost made it.  So sad they had to fade it.  Everybody wants to move so so Bye.  I can't stand this indecision Parried with a lack of vision.  Everybody wants to rule the world.

Everybody wants to do the same.  Thank you.  Drink up, baby, down My window round.  Leave your things behind Cos it's all going off without you.
