            "text": "Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm Dr.  Boyce Watkins from Your Black World and the Black Business School.  And I want to say hello, first and foremost.  But second of all, I want to let you guys know that I was reading about Steve Harvey being let go of a couple of his shows.  As you guys know, or may or may not know, he was dropped from his daytime show.  I guess he's being replaced by Kelly Clarkson.  And then also his show Little Big Shots moved on and kind of let him go.  And Steve said something really interesting about the layoff that i really wanted to share with you guys because i think there's a great lesson in this.  steve harvey you know he ain't all bad he ain't all good but he ain't all bad.  sometimes he says something that's wise and uh and i i figured out a fairness to the brother because y'all seen me uh say things toward him that i that you know reflected how i felt about some of the stuff that he said.  but then there's some areas where i think um you have to give props where it's due.  so let me read this uh hit the thumbs up button as i pull this up.  please hit that thumbs up button.  um all right.  so here's what he said.  uh Basically, he said, let me go down here.  He was talking to a brother in the audience.  And the brother was talking about getting laid off.  And he was basically saying, you know, what happens when you put out applications and you're doing your best and they either lay you off or they don't want to give you the job, you know, things like that.  And so Steve responds and he says, well, first of all, let's look at the layoff of what it was.  It was time for you to go.  And sometimes, man, we don't jump.  Sometimes we get pushed.  Now, you know, Steve is a spiritual guy.  So he went toward God and he said, you see, God is really fair.  And when he wants you to do something else and you won't do it, he'll bring about a set of circumstances that will cause you.  So now there's obviously something that you should be doing instead of what you was doing.  And then he basically asked the guy what his gift was.  And the guy said that his gift was cooking.  And Steve said, well, if cooking is your gift, then why are you working in a computer store?  And I thought that was really fascinating because a lot of us run away from our gifts.  A lot of us, I guess we don't feel that we have the right nor the ability to monetize our talents.  So we go monetize somebody else's talents or monetize for somebody else on things that are not our talents.  And we end up wondering what our true purpose was.  And you don't know what it was.  You're wondering the what ifs because you're living the wrong life.  Some of y'all are living life you should not be living.  some of you are doing things you should not be doing.  you're in a place that you know you shouldn't be but you're too scared to sort of go and find out where these other places are that you're supposed to be.  so so sometimes rejection is the greatest thing that ever happened to you.  you know it's.  it's like think about a bad relationship.  I remember once I dated a girl and I thought I was in love and I really wanted to be with her and everything and but she didn't want nothing to do with me.  you know she said I'm ready to move on and I like this other man and blah blah blah blah.  well I was really sad about it, but I found out later on that I was being pushed away.  And you know what happened?  A few months later, I met an amazing woman who was 10 times better than the woman I was with before.  And I was like, okay, so now I know why that was a wonderful thing.  Now I know why I was being pushed.  I was being pushed toward a better situation.  And sometimes we don't let go of the things that are holding us back the most.  You know, you got something that's holding you back and you can't let go of it because you're scared of what's going to happen when you let go.  And the thing about it is, I found that the universe has a way of catching you.  And you have a way of catching yourself.  You've got the power and the ability to survive.  Remember, you're the descendants of the people who survived the Middle Passage, who survived 250 years of the most brutal, worst forms of slavery in the history of all mankind, who survived 40 years of Jim Crow and mass incarceration.  So the fact that you survived all of that means you can certainly survive when that white man decides he won't lay you off on your job.  So anyway... It also says, Steve Harvey also says, you got to understand how it works.  Your life ain't nothing but a book.  I happen to be 62 years old, he said.  In the 62nd chapter, I got my finger on the corner of the page.  All I'm doing is I'm about to turn it.  I can't wait to see what God's got for me on that other page.  And I agree.  I think that what I've also noticed about life is that what tends to shape your reality tends to be what's inside of you.  If you're always a hardworking person, always a person that's optimistic and moving forward, always a person who's strategic and making plans and networking and doing your best, you're going to land somewhere good.  You're going to land somewhere good.  You'll probably land in a place that you least expect it, but you're going to be somewhere good.  Now, somebody who has bad habits, you know, a shitty person who's lazy and treats people like crap and lives a bad life, well, they're going to end somewhere bad.  You usually get what you deserve in life.  The universe has a really crazy way of balancing things out where in the long term, if you are consistent with your strategy, you're going to get what's coming to you, whether it's good or bad.  So don't be going around fucking people over because that's going to come back and get you.  But if you go out here and you're doing good things and you're a good person and you're working hard and you're doing your best and you're doing what's right and you're following your passion, you're going to get what you deserve too, in a good way.  So I like what Steve said.  I don't care what anybody says about Steve and other stuff, and it's fine.  And y'all heard me personally say things where I really disagree with what he said, but out of fairness to the man, I got to give him props on this particular piece of advice.  And I'm glad he spoke up on the vulnerability he felt with being laid off from the show.  He actually said on Instagram later on, it was like talking to myself.  And so Steve knows a little bit about rejection.  It looks like Steve's going to move on and be fine.  I don't know what the deal is with all these firings.  I honestly suspect there might be something else going on that.  maybe they're trying to head off controversy because you know you have that thing going on with his wife and the rumors of the divorce and then her ex-husband threatening to write that tell-all book and revealing her crazy life with the fans and watching and all that.  Maybe they don't want all of that on top of their host and I can see that because shows like Family Feud and and daytime tv and little big shots those are very like white friendly kind of you know like cushy toilet papery kind of shows you know like like that soft cotton nail toilet paper i think it's what it's called that feels real like it's real.  they're real soft fuzzy kinds of things where they can't.  they're not ready for a host who's really having a real life.  a real black man is having real black man problems.  i don't think they're ready for that you know.  and so and so really seriously having a wife whose ex-boyfriend just got out the pen is about to try to burn down your house with a tell-all book.  Those are some black man problems.  Now, those are white people problems.  White people get those problems too, but y'all know what I'm talking about.  Most of y'all can relate to this.  And so I honestly think that Steve is in an interesting world where there's a lot of financial rewards that come with that, but there's a lot of vulnerabilities as well.  It's very difficult for a black man to really do well in mainstream America, mainstream TV, Especially if he's, you know, a straight black man and he's living, you know, he's really interacting and engaging with other black people.  Like Michael Strahan does daytime TV, but Michael ain't really out there like that.  You know, and, you know, so anyway, anyway, I'm out of here, guys.  Have a good day.
