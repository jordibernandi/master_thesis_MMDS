            "text": "At Torah to the Tribes, we have really enjoyed hosting the past several feasts.  There's been an influx of people from all over the world that have gained interest in coming and congregating together at these three annual pilgrimage feast sites.  Well, Shavuot, the Feast of Pentecost, it is quickly approaching.  So now is the time, if you look at the description below, to register for the Feast of Shavuot Pentecost.  Of course, this is the feast of the indwelling of the Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit.  What better time to come together in community, in faith, where I can get to meet you personally.  We'll have worship, Bible study in the Oregon wilderness at Mulalla Retreat.  You arrive Friday, May 24th for three nights.  and leave, depart on Monday, May 27th.  It's a great facility.  All of the description below, you can register.  I hope to see you.  Make an effort, plan now, and come and enjoy the Feast of Shavuot with Torah to the Tribes here in Oregon.  I hope to see you soon.  Bye. ",
