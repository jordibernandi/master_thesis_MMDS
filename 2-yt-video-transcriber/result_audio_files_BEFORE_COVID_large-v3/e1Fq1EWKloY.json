Now we have a Korean guy and he just doesn't do well on this show and I cannot figure out why.  so this will be an interactive for all of us.  Why don't all of you in the comments, once you finish watching this video, explain to me what this guy does wrong?  because he seems to do everything correct, almost.  The song he's about to sing, I burst out into the song quite a few times in the past because everyone sings this song because it's China's corniest but also most well-loved love song.  So he starts out singing the song.  It's Tonghua.  Fairytale by Guangliang is his name, I believe.  So famous that there's been lots of English translations.  Here it goes. ",

            "text": "There's a common stereotype.  I don't know how it is among white girls or black girls or Hispanic girls or Indian girls or whatever, but among East Asian girls, Korean guys are like the Sean Connerys of Asian guys.  So they're maybe too machismo.  They may be too patriarchal.  They might be too much.  You could almost... veer them into a toxically masculine type of vibe, but most Chinese girls I've talked to are like, yeah, Korean guys gotta be careful, man.  They're a little too .  That's the Chinese expression.  It's like, yeah, they're too alpha male type of vibe.  If there's any kind of domestic violence that happens and the girls are gonna believe it, it's gonna be like, yeah, Well, you know, Korean guys, what do you expect, man?  Although domestic violence probably happens a lot in Chinese homes, too.  I think Big Eye Girl, the way she runs her mouth, she kind of set off something, some kind of alarm in every girl.  It's like, oh my God, man, it sucks.  Some of these women on stage probably watched their moms get beaten at home, too.  So it's like, oh my God, I don't want to get beaten.  And this time it's a guy who's not even from my area.  There's going to be more communication, cultural barriers.  This could be what trips him up.  But I think he responded pretty well.  He's like, there's bad people.  And the host even helped him.  There's bad people from all walks of life.  There's good people from all walks of life.  I know this girl.  She's Chinese.  Her Korean boyfriend's like, you must call me oppa.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Some of my Korean fans, they have Chinese girlfriends.  Hey, there's a trend.  A lot of my Korean audience has Chinese girlfriends, the men.  Their Chinese girlfriends always call them oppa.  Fuck, man.  Imagine if I date a Korean girl and she calls me oppa.  I'd be like, shut the fuck up, girl.  My name's Jerry.  I like my fucking name.  Also, Big Eye Girl gives those little doe eyes.  Man, I think it makes a lot of guys weak, including me.  When I see Big Eye Girl give those doe eyes, I just want to hug her.  Zekia gives those doe eyes, too, which is why a lot of guys who watch my channel, they're in love with Zekia.  Hey, Zekia, if you watched this, I think I just found out why all the guys that watch my channel love you.  And this is probably why I like Big Eye Girl.  And maybe that's why big eyes are so attractive.  It's not just because big eyes are more rare in East Asian countries.  It's also because, just in general, With big eyes, they're more expressive.  You're able to see more emotional nuances.  You can see when she's attracted to you better.  You can see when she's sad better.  You can get more nonverbal communication from a girl with big eyes.  because let's be honest, most guys are not as good with nonverbal communication as women are.  They give a little bit of non-verbal communication.  They expect a man to know 100% what she's thinking.  So if a girl has bigger eyes, you might actually be able to get 20% of it.  So you'll avoid 20% of the arguments.  But I could just be justifying why I like big-eyed girls so much. ",

So there is this stereotype even in China that the fu or dai, the people who are heirs to something, they probably aren't the hardest working or they are too spoiled or they don't know how to deal with the real world.  That could be tripping up a little bit, but Is it though?  Is that a breaking point?  And then I looked up the TV show she mentioned, The Heirs.  I've never seen it.  It's a Korean drama.  Doesn't have that high ratings on.  So maybe the host screwed them up by invoking this bad show that all the women don't like.  I don't know.  I feel like the only thing I can pinpoint right now is that maybe it all seems too good to be true.  Why is this guy from Korea who seems perfect here in China trying to pick up chicks?  There must be something wrong with him, right?  That could be.  But then remember that case where There was that British dude who seemed too perfect and all the girls liked him.  The other thing I can think of is there's the looks thing.  Potentially he's just not that good looking Korean guy.  I don't think he's bad looking, but he sure as heck doesn't look like a K-pop person or a model.  So maybe it's all about looks, right?  These women are very superficial.  Chinese women in general are pretty superficial, but these women especially, these Shanghainese freaking spoiled people, probably very rich girls, they're all very spoiled.  So could it be looks?  Or could it be?  it just seems too good to be true for some guy in China who's Korean?  I don't know.  What do you guys think, man?
