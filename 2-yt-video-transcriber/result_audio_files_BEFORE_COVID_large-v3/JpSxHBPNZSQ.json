A Change.org petition that was created by a person named Saika Noreen in the UK says that a logo stamped into the sole of Nike resembles the word Allah in Arabic and is blasphemous.  The petition asked Nike to recall its Nike Air Max 270 shoe.  saying, quote, this is disrespectful and extremely offensive to Muslims and insulting to Islam, end quote.  Noreen writes in the petition, the Air Max 270 went on sale in new colors, retails for $150 and features Air Max stamped into the sole.  So before they go out on recall, pick up a pair. ",

Like if you're offended, here's an easy solution for you guys to whoever is offended by the issues.  don't buy the fucking shoe okay.  but like people say you shouldn't be offended no it's okay to be offended right you can be offended.  there's nothing wrong with being offended.  the problem is when you think you're being offended means other people have to do something because you're offended Right.  And you could just go be offended by yourself.  And there's an easy solution to that.  If you're offended by a book, don't read it.  If you're offended by certain music, don't listen to it.  If you're offended by a fucking shoe, don't buy it.  But when you try to get other people to follow your rules, Because you're offended.  I think this needs to backfire so much because we need to show people That this doesn't work.  like.  you know how.  the dry muhammad cartoon.  Um The annual event for drawing muhammad, right?  That really show like if Muslims when they try to act like oh you can't draw Muhammad because we're offended.  Now it's an annual event and now they're not sensitive about it as much as used.  I mean there still are but it's much better than before because we desensitize them because it's now an annual event.  right now They're claiming.  now they're going around claiming that they were never offending.  Oh sure go draw Muhammad do whatever the fuck we want.  No, you were not like this.  We made you know these.  we desensitize a lot of you and You were not originally like this.  But with this, I think there needs to be a call out for toilet paper with Allah on it.  I've seen some Muslims claim that there's Allah on toilet papers by actually just by squishing it and being offended.  They really go out of their way to find things that they're offended about.  But I think there needs to be clear, purposeful toilet paper with Allah symbol on it as a response to this campaign.  Just to show people that whenever you try to get other people to not to do something because you're offended, it's going to backfire on you big time.  And not only you're not going to achieve what you wanted, It's going to get a lot worse.  Because if they win something like this, they're not going to stop, right?  They're not going to stop.  They're going to go after something else after this.  It's going to encourage them to weaponize being offended about some things, to win other battles as well.  They need to lose this battle big.  So whoever goes out and puts on Etsy or whatever, I don't know where would allow this, toilet papers with Allah symbol on it, please come to us and show it that you're selling it.  And we will advertise the fuck out of it on Atheist Republic.  And Atheist Republic Facebook page, we have 2 million followers.  On Instagram, we have 60,000.  Twitter, we're getting close to 100,000.  We'll mention it on our YouTube channel.  Our YouTube channel is not that big, but we're growing.  So if you're out there and you want to make some money, go make toilet papers with a law symbol on it and come let us know And we will market that.  we will promote that on all our platforms.  So please go ahead and do that.  Jim, do you want it to say something? ",

Phillip is saying that he hopes that they don't give in and they keep their shoe.  It's just a symbol that by coincidence looks like something else.  And any mature person would see that and not demand a change.  Yeah, but I want to show them that if you are offended by a logo that coincidentally looks like Allah, because of you being so pissy about it, now you're going to get toilet paper that is on purpose looks like Allah.  Pete is saying, I might buy a pair so I can walk all over their imaginary god.

We need actual products with actual Allah, real Allah on it.  The fact that they're offended by this shows that they're trying.  They're professionals.  They made it their career to become offended by things, or else Islam becomes irrelevant.  They need to be offended.  If they run out of things to be offended about, they're upset that there's not that many offensive things out there.  Because just like the social justice warriors, right, on the far left, that they need to find things to be offended about or else they're going to lose relevancy.
