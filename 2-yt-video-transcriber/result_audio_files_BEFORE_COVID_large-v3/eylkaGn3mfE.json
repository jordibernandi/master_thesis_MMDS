When you die, are you certain that you will spend eternity with God?  Are you certain right now?  If you're not, I want you to stay tuned for this program.  And, Erwin, you actually had one of your staff members go to a Christian convention of booksellers.  These are the guys that sell the Christian books all across the world.  And you had them ask a very important question to the booksellers there.  Tell us about it. ",

            "text": "Well, you know, the question was simply this, how perfect do you have to be to go to heaven?  Now, these are Christians who write books, who are on the radio, and the answers were very interesting.  Most of them said, well, I hope not too perfect or I wouldn't make it.  Or someone else said, well, Christians aren't perfect.  They are only forgiven.  So what I want to say on this program today with you, John, is simply this.  Let's lay it out there.  Unless you are as perfect as God... you will not make it.  So let's emphasize that.  And that has actually historically been believed by Catholics and Protestants.  I mean, when you stop to think of it, it's only logical.  How could a holy God accept anyone unless he or she were as holy as He Himself is?  So if you're listening today, my friend, and you're discovering that this is very unsettling, and you're convinced you aren't going to make it into heaven because you know right well you're not perfect, this program is for you.
