            "text": "you.  Greetings, family.  How are you?  A while back ago, about two years ago, or just under two years ago, Walking Stick told us to pay attention to certain counter sites, especially Forex.  And the reason why is because his firm was asked to do an experiment of lifting the first, second, and third zero, and only using the Iraqi dinar on the second set of books that was turned in when they paid their employees.  One of our fireflies caught it and brought it to us and we said, well done.  Our firefly yesterday caught the second article.  It sure took him a hell of a long time if you ask me, you know?  But there's detail to this.  Oh, there's so much more.  Like for example, I have to say that I dreamed.  I dreamed that a friend of mine a few Saturdays ago, they were having a meeting and they were sitting there and they were talking and some of them are connected to the CBI in my dream.  I'm just pretending that I know this.  And in that dream, they were like, rewrite, rewrite.  Why are we rewriting these contracts?  And, you know, they said, well, you know why?  Because, you know, we recalculated, so we have to rewrite.  All righty, and these that we're doing right here, I see that we're doing them in our currency, just like we did with the car, you know, the second set of books, yeah, the second set of books, but that's not going to last.  What do you mean?  Well, you know, and this isn't my dream, you know what I'm saying?  Okay, this is just my dream.  I don't know.  And the guy that is associated with the banks, because, you know, he owns a bank, he says, yeah, we're writing, rewriting the new math.  because we recalculated and we're making our contracts that we're rewriting in our currency only the Iraqi dinar.  So, you know, excuse me, question?  No, it wasn't like that in my dream, but it was like, yeah, okay.  Well, what about the complementary complement, you know, the ones that are matching this in the other countries?  Well, this one that we're doing is for the United States, yeah.  They're writing theirs up to match ours in American dollars.  Well, that would be a one-to-one, wouldn't it?  Yeah, it's a one, but look, that's not important, right?  I mean, that's gonna change in a few weeks anyways.  What we need to do is make sure that we got, what'd he say?  shut up just shut up.  so in my dream i said just shut up you know just keep working.  you know i keep working keep working all right meetings over let's go catch you later.  and um so you know you make a call in my dream and they say hey what what you know what just happened what really?  yeah it's about time don't you think?  yeah?  So with that happening, then all of a sudden out of the blue, Firefly, whichever, last night says, look, so I get a hold of Samson and I say, stop, stop, stop the press, man.  Don't put no more up.  You see, when we put stuff up, we're copied and pasted by thieves.  I shouldn't say that, I'm sorry, God forgive me.  I know we should share everything because we're not taking anything with us, so if we're helping others, that's good.  But I say thievery because they claim it's theirs and then they go and change it and cost me, oh my God, how many phone calls today, Tink?  I don't know, about 80.  80 times two, probably.  I'm going to need a vacation after this vacation.  I'm serious.  Anyways, what happened is that the Firefly census, I tell Samson and all of our news sounds, stop, don't put anything up.  I don't want nobody to know this.  This is what we've been telling everybody.  So I call walking stick and I said, sir, I'm so sorry.  And he struggled to communicate.  And then he finally says, well, it's about blankety, blankety, blankety, blankety, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank.  time that they released this.  And I said, do you think this is it?  He said, I don't know.  All I know is I've been waiting for it.  He said, get Delta.  copy.  I got Delta on the phone.  we protect walking stick.  not even Delta knows who he is.  so walking stick is quiet in the background and I'm asking Delta Delta look look at this.  look at this.  so we're sending it to him and I got the recording.  you're gonna enjoy it because it's a. it's a. it's a sequence of events that happened.  calling this one calling hooking up with this way are you sure?  verify translate.  but.  and then all of a sudden Manny Delta says, Frankie, Frankie, are you ready?  I said, what do you mean, am I ready?  I'm driving.  Should I pull over?  He said, maybe.  You serious?  Yeah, let's pull over.  Okay, what's it say?  First of all, look at the date.  No, no, Frank, reverse it.  I did.  Are you sure it's not from April?  No, it's from today.  The wording, I noticed some of the words are the same.  What do you think?  No, Frankie, they're not telling you the benefits and the cost from lifting the three zeros.  Frankie, here, whatever he says, they cannot have an idea.  Does it say that?  No, no, no, no.  What's it say?  And when he translated it, he reached it to me in Arabic first so I can try to learn the language.  And then he tells me what it said.  And he says, Frank, they're not talking about the benefits and the cost of lifting the three zeros.  They're talking about the benefits and the cost of what happened because they lifted the three zeros.  What?  Yeah.  And wait, wait, wait.  You remember what Walking Stick said to educate the citizens?  I said, yeah, yeah.  What?  Guess what they're doing on the 4th of July?  I said, I know what we're... Look at the pretty blue birds, huh?  Isn't that pretty?  It's a hell of a long dream, ain't it?  This is all my opinion.  I don't have any knowledge.  I don't have any understanding except that I get these dreams, so I come and tell you about them, okay?  I get most of my dreams when I sleepwalk.  No, I don't sleepwalk.  I do walk to the toilet.  So I said, tell me, man.  Read it to me one more time.  Are you sure the date?  You sure this is new?  Yes.  Yes.  They're having a seminar on the 4th of July.  What time?  Right after Trump... Are you kidding me?  What's it about?  This!  This!  He kept yelling and screaming.  Wait till you hear him on the phone.  This!  Frankly, they're having a seminar to explain why they lifted to three zeros.  And the benefits of it.  It says it.  That's what it says, Frank.  And he was like, oh my God.  And I was like, yeah.  I told you so.  I love to surf.  These are about four footers.  They're nice.  They don't travel very far, but they push you.  I want to thank our firefly that helped us to find the three zeros two years ago.  And we brought the evidence to you and you were pleased.  And then you took it to God in prayer.  I want to thank the same firefly that we protect, that has allowed us to find the beginning of the second article that is being released.  A seminar family, a seminar.  How many people you think in Iraq are going to come to that seminar and understand why?  Their monetary reform is about to give them purchasing power.  Now, there's much more.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  It sounds like I'm being coy, like I'm being, you know, what's the word?  You know, teasing you.  No, I'm not.  There's a hell of a lot more.  There's so much more.  We can't keep up with it and we can't share it all with you.  But what I am sharing with you right now is strictly in my opinion.  And it is what I told you.  So, so y'all take care of each other.  Okay.  Pray for each other.  Be strong.  Let's see what our president says tomorrow.  Do you understand?  I told you.  I am looking for a combination of words that would trigger off other countries to come out and say, listen, president asked me to play fair with my currency.  Guess what we're going to do with our currency?  We're going to do this.  We're going to print new one.  We're going to back it up.  We're going to put it with gold.  We're going to do it.  Oh, are you really?  Yeah.  Well, Yogi, boo boo invites you to the picnic basket.  Sounds good to me.  Sound good to you, family.  Why not at a one to one?  But that won't last long.  Because in a few weeks, that will change in my dream.  That was a week ago last Saturday.  I love you.  I love you in ways that my parents taught me to.  We're going to do things for God's kingdom very soon.  Y'all take care of each other, okay?  I'm not dressed in red because I'm Santa Claus today.  I am dressed in red because I am traveling towards the east.  Aloha.  Aloha. ",
