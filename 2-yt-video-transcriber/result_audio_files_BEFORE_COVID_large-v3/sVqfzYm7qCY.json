And I would also like to shout out and thank Ryan Grimm on the show for actually putting us in touch with Catherine for that interview about Bolivia.  That was great.  Good looking out, Ryan.  Good looking out, Ryan Grimm.  This is in The Intercept.  Pete Buttigieg touted three major supporters of his Douglas Plan for Black America.  They were alarmed when they saw it.  And this story is basically the Pete Buttigieg campaign is a brochure for a small liberal arts college in the Northeast that has just photoshopped just a bunch of smiling college kids and then just like a photoshopped Samuel L. Jackson stock photo into the brochure touting their diverse community and support.  But you can still see the watermark on the face.  Okay, so I'm just going to start reading here.  In July, he released his campaign's chief piece of policy outreach to black voters called The Douglas Plan, a comprehensive investment in the empowerment of black America.  The plan covers everything from criminal justice reform to public health care, education, and beyond.  It proposes using federal contracting rules to increase the amount of contracts going to minority and women-owned firms to 25% and offers student loan deferment and forgiveness to Pell Grant recipients who go on to start businesses that employ at least three people.

Buttigieg's campaign says it reached out to the company about the possibility of being released from a confidentiality agreement, but the mayor has so far stayed quiet.  For nearly three years, he worked at McKinsey & Company, an elite management consulting firm with offices around the world.  It was work that took him, he has said, to Iraq and Afghanistan.  And for years after that, in his early campaigns for public office, Buttigieg held up his stint in McKinsey as a selling point and proof that he was a business-friendly Democrat while only vaguely describing what he did and never revealing his clients.  Asked by BuzzFeed News this week if Buttigieg would be willing to provide more information about his role at the firm, spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed that the campaign on at least two occasions has asked McKinsey about ways around the nondisclosure pact.  Buttigieg's work is largely covered by a nondisclosure agreement, Meagher said Friday.  McKinsey has become known for working with authoritarian regimes and taking on other ethically complicated projects.  A New York Times report last year focused on its work for governments or state-owned companies in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.  A recent lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company that makes OxyContin raised questions about the firm's role in perpetuating the opioid crisis.  That is a hell of a fucking resume right there. ",
