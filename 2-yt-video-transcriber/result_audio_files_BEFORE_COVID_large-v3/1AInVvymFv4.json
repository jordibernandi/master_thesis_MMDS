            "text": "So the judge in Alexa Roberts' paternity and child support lawsuit against Hunter Biden spontaneously and without explanation recuses himself from the file.  I am sure this is not going to cause anybody to ask themselves any questions.  Viva Frye, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber, and this story looks like it's beginning to be the 2020 version of the vlog that keeps on vlogging.  For those of you who don't know, Hunter Biden has been involved in a paternity child support lawsuit against one Alexis Roberts.  Or to put it more accurately, Alexis Roberts filed a lawsuit against Hunter Biden claiming child support, which first required the establishing of the paternity of the father of the child, which was proven to be Hunter Biden.  And for those of you who don't know, Alexis Roberts is a performer at a Washington D.C.  gentlemen's club who was accidentally made a mother by Hunter Biden.  I actually did a vlog on a procedural aspect of this case a little while ago.  I'll link that video right here.  Give it a watch.  It's a good one.  But this is procedure at a whole new level.  What is going on?  Before we even get into the question of the recusal of a judge from a file, let's just set the procedural context of this particular case.  In the context of the lawsuit, it is established through DNA testing that Hunter Biden is, in fact, the father of the child.  Recently, Alexis Roberts had petitioned the court to compel the production of financial information so that she could get an idea as to Hunter Biden's financial status for the purposes of establishing child support.  Hunter Biden made a motion to court requesting that any such documentation be kept under seal because otherwise it would only be exploited for political purposes, obviously given the upcoming 2020 elections.  And I made a vlog explaining how and under what conditions documentation filed in an otherwise public court record can in fact be filed under seal.  And a few weeks later we have two mysterious motions from an intervening party, one of which gets dismissed, and then the judge recuses himself from the file before adjudicating on the second motion.  Now before we get into the recusal, let's just go over those two motions.  and who is this intervening party.  The first motion is entitled, A Notice of Fraud and Counterfeiting and Production of Evidence.  Comes now the intervener, in this case in support of plaintiff with this subject.  notice relative to defendant's failure to answer reasonable discovery requests.  Paragraph 2.  The intervener, agency, has been actively investigating the defendant, his partners, associates, and business dealings since 8 August 2016.  Now, I'm not going to read through all of the allegations of that notice.  You can read through it yourself.  I'll post a link to the document in the pinned comment.  The allegations are salacious.  The allegations are serious.  The allegations make allegations of criminal wrongdoing in civil proceedings.  The bottom line is that the intervener, who is not yet an intervener and we're going to get into that, is alleging that the defendants did not properly answer questions that they were asked in discovery or communicate required documents as they were compelled to do so.  And the intervener, an investigation agency that has been investigating the defendants since 2016, is apparently saying they have evidence to prove that the defendants have not provided the accurate answers to the questions.  And they have filed this notice in the hopes of entering into the court record the documents that they think make evidence of their allegations.  Alright, just to open up one parenthesis to summarize the essence of these two intervening motions, they make allegations of money laundering, counterfeiting, fraud,  etc.,  etc.,  presumably to show that Hunter Biden is either concealing his assets or has done certain bad things in order to acquire those assets.  Paragraph 3 of the Notice of Fraud and Counterfeiting in Production of Evidence.  Defendant is the subject of more than one criminal investigation involving fraud, money laundering, and a counterfeiting scheme, with no supporting evidence or documentation to substantiate that allegation.  And at paragraph 2 of the Motion to Intervene, which we will get to.  On 23 December 2019, Intervener provided this honourable court with information related to defendant's active concealment of bank account records in a pleading of which the original is provided on this date.  And also particularly relevant, Alexis Roberts' attorneys have publicly stated that they are not seeking the help of this investigation agency, and have referred to their efforts as a, and I am quoting, At the very least, on its face, it seems to suggest that Alexis Roberts' attorneys are not seeking the assistance of this agency, they are not working with them, and they don't seem to be very much liking of what they are doing in this court file right now.  End of parentheses.  Now, what ends up happening is that the judge in the file dismisses this motion, strikes it from the court record on the basis that it's totally procedurally improper, and the judge is not wrong.  The intervening party that just filed this notice for fraud is not yet an intervening party to the lawsuit.  From what I understand, under Arkansas law, the intervening party that just filed this notice for fraud hadn't even filed a notice to intervene.  And under Arkansas law, a party can intervene to a proceeding either of right or with permission of the court.  If a party can intervene of right, it basically means they don't need the court's permission to intervene in a lawsuit.  If they do need the court's permission to intervene, they need to file a notice to intervene and get authorization from the court to intervene in that court file.  And there has to be a good reason to authorize that party to intervene.  They have to have some sort of interest in the court file, above and beyond just wanting to file documents in it.  So the judge dismisses this notice of fraud and strikes it from the record under its apparent procedural impropriety, and what happens?  Four days later, the intervening party files this Notice of Intervention as required under Arkansas Procedural Law.  And as you can see from this second motion, it is entitled.  Motion to Intervene.  Motion to Intervene.  Comes now DNA Investigations,  Inc.,  intervener, and serves its motion as provided for in Rule 5, Arkansas Procedural Rules, in support thereof states, 18 U.S.C.  Section 4 requires one having knowledge of the commission of a felony to make known to a judge or other person in civil or military authority under the U.S And so what seems to be happening here is that this intervening party realizes that they filed their notice of fraud before actually making a motion to intervene.  So after having their notice of fraud dismissed for its procedural impropriety, they try to remedy that procedural impropriety and be recognized as an intervener to the lawsuit.  And what happens before the judge can adjudicate on their motion to intervene?  He spontaneously and without explanation recuses himself from the file.  Now this may just be my own personal experience, but it is rather rare to have a judge recuse themselves from a file in the middle of a file.  Now the reasons for which a judge would be recused from a file either voluntarily or on motion by the party are relatively serious.  There has to be something of a material conflict of interest, there would have to be extreme bias for or prejudice against one of the parties, or there would have to be some very serious medical or personal issue that would make it impossible for the judge to continue in the file.  But you imagine a judge recusing oneself from a file mid-file.  If you're in the middle of a trial, you basically have to start that trial all over again in front of a new judge when you get one appointed.  And while the judge recused himself voluntarily from this file, typically that doesn't happen.  Typically it happens that a party petitions the court to have the judge recused for one of the reasons I enumerated earlier.  And you wanna know what the ironic novelty of a motion to recuse is?  The judge who is the object of the motion to recuse is the one who adjudicates on the party's motion to recuse that judge.  In other words, the judge themselves decides whether or not they think they are in a conflict of interest.  that warrants them recusing themselves from the file.  And you know darn well if you make a motion to recuse the judge and the judge does not recuse themselves, the judge is not really gonna like the party that made the motion to recuse in the first place.  So this is one of those motions that you have to make only when you are 1000% certain the judge is going to grant the recusal, or when you are 1000% certain that you don't care if the judge recuses themselves and stays in the file with a grudge against you for the rest of the file.  Alright, and why might the judge hold a grudge against the person who made a motion to the judge to recuse themselves from the file?  The motion basically has to allege that the judge is unable to do his or her job in the file.  The motion basically has to allege that the judge is so biased that they are not able to judge independently, that they're too old, too sick, or that there's some other conflict of interest that renders them unable to do their job as a judge.  As a rule, judges do not like getting motions to recuse, so when they get one, and if they don't recuse themselves from the file, it may leave some lingering bad taste in the judge's mouth.  Isn't the practice of law beautiful?  And a fun anecdote from my own practice.  I was involved in a file where we got to trial.  We had waited something like a year to get our trial date.  After virtually a full day of trial, the judge suddenly says that he needs to take a recess.  We take a recess, and when we come back from the recess, the judge says, look, I have something that I think I need to tell everybody.  And the judge looks at me and says, I realize now that I was in fact a judge who adjudicated on a criminal matter involving your client's spouse.  It was a serious criminal matter, people had heard about it, it made the news.  And while it was totally unrelated to my client, it could cause somebody to suspect that the judge might view my client as guilty by association.  And the judge said, would you like me to recuse myself?  Which means, would we like to go get another trial date?  Would we like to wait another year?  Do we want to start from scratch with that trial, re-prepping the witnesses, re-calling the witnesses,  etc.,  etc.?  What does everyone think the instructions from my client were?  Spoiler alert, we did not ask the judge to recuse himself.  But it did make for a good story to tell friends and colleagues, because it doesn't happen all that often.  And so now in the Hunter Biden case, we have these two motions from an intervening party, which is an investigation firm that has been investigating Hunter Biden and its associates since 2016.  The judge that dismisses the notice of fraud prior to adjudicating on the motion to intervene recuses himself from the file with no further explanation.  This is the stuff that Hollywood movies are made of.  A judge recusing himself from such a high-profile case so spontaneously and unexpectedly is sure to trigger some people asking a lot of questions.  People are going to hypothesize, people are going to pontificate, but at the very least, now you have some of the procedural understanding in order to pontificate in full awareness of fact and law.  All right, actually, last parentheses just to explain what will probably happen next.  Apparently, from the article I read, this lawsuit has now been referred back to the administrative plan of the 16th Judicial District.  What I suspect that means is that they are going to find another judge to preside over this entire matter.  The motion to intervene is going to remain in limbo until there is a judge in the file to adjudicate on that motion.  I don't believe that the intervening party, even if their status as an intervener is duly recognized by the court, is going to be able to ask for a re-adjudication on their initial notice of fraud.  What they may have to do if their status as an intervener is in fact recognized by the court is probably amend and refile that notice of fraud.  To see if, if and when their status as an intervener is recognized, a judge in the file now determines that they have the requisite interest to file the documents they wanted to file under that notice of fraud.  But basically, my understanding now is that this file is going to remain in administrative limbo until they name a new judge to the file, and I suspect that the parties are going to have to start anew any motions that were already underway before that judge who just recused himself from the file.  If any hearings were currently underway, you can't just bring in a new judge and continue going from there.  You have to start from scratch, produce all the evidence before the judge who's going to render the decision.  It's going to cause some delays in the court file until they can name a new judge who's going to take carriage of that matter.  Will the court recognize them as a legitimate intervening party, or will that motion also be dismissed?  In which case, we've just had a lot of legal drama with no real punchline.  And that's it.  First vlog of 2020.  I hope it gives you some insight and some hindsight, because as they say, hindsight is 2020.  But as we're going to say throughout the year, present is 2020.  Mm-hmm.  I made that up.  I posted that to Twitter, and I was very happy with it, so I figured I should include it in this vlog.
