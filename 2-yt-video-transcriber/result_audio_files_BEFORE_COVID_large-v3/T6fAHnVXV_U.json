The thing where one day I just whipped out a last minute idea and somehow stumbled onto my most popular series ever.  Go figure.  But anyway, today I thought I'd spend a little time talking about how totally thick-skinned most Christians are.  How they don't really mind criticism of their religion because they're confident that it's true and recognize that since God's real he can stick up for himself.  Oh, and also they have a solid grasp on how non-believers think and what Christianity looks like from the outside.  So while they don't agree with people who criticize or make fun, they at least understand where others are coming from when they do so and kind of take things in stride.  Huh, okay, totally not at all, right?  In fact, if you ever do, you know, make fun of God or Jesus or the Bible in front of Christians, things tend to get really tense really quick.  and in fact they'll probably take personal offense, maybe accusing you of blasphemy and saying something along the lines of, How dare you mock my faith!  Okay, so to be honest, this one actually makes a bit of sense, right?  I mean, making fun of people is generally considered rude and you kind of have to expect them to get a bit edgy when you take a dig at something as personal and sacred as their religion.  I very sincerely get that and I strongly encourage other atheists to be thoughtful about when and how they comment about Christianity.  When I go into the home of a friend or family member, I don't walk around commenting every time I see a picture of Jesus or hear them make a conversationally natural reference to their own religion.  I'm not rude when they pray before meals and in fact make a habit of just quietly closing my eyes with them when they do so.  Sure, I'll tactfully hold my ground if the conversation gets opinionated, but I'm not at all sarcastic about it and I'm not typically going to be the one bringing it up.  So if you're the type who just walks around indiscriminately smarting off to religious people, you need to stop it because you're being an a**hole.  I mean, sure, I can kind of understand if you're a kid who quit believing in God like last week and thus have tons of pent-up frustration with all the religious pressure that's been put on you and just want to tell the world all the things you're figuring out.  But you need to develop a sense of what your opinion sounds like to others, even when you're right, and what it might do to your personal relationships.  And when in doubt, try to tone it down or just keep your mouth shut altogether.  People are already going to unfairly ostracize you, so there's no reason to go burning more bridges than you need to.  And also, you know, your friends and family and especially your parents are humans with feelings, even if what they believe might not be rational.  So if you're strutting around being a jerk to them, the fact that you happen to be correct about God's existence doesn't keep you from being totally wrong about how you treat others.  And that's way more important.  Of course, I say this fully understanding you may have been put through the ringer by religious people in your lives.  You feel Christianity's messed you up, and you're still dealing with a lot of residual anxiety and confusion over totally unnecessary things.  And if that weren't enough, people are putting pressure on you to believe and treating you like a shitty person just for having doubts and questions you can't ignore.  What you're dealing with is very real.  So yes, find a place to vent, find people who can commiserate, and reach out to those, me or others, who have a bit more experience and can give you a little guidance.  Busy as this channel keeps me, I always try to prioritize people dealing with things like this.  But just take care and make sure you're not becoming the bad guy, because it's kind of easy to start doing before you realize it.  Now at this point I can imagine what you might be thinking.  Hey Prophet of Zod, why did you call this dumb things people say to atheists if you're just going to lecture us about being polite to Christians?  And the answer is that's not all I'm going to be talking about.  Trust me, not by a long shot.  Because while it is important to be polite to Christians as people, mockery of Christianity as a religion is also important, in the right time and place.  And after you get done thinking that, or maybe before simultaneously because I don't know since I'm not a mind reader, you might start thinking, and why are you of all people lecturing us anyway?  Aren't you the one who makes all those rude cartoons with God and Jesus acting like idiots and swearing at each other?  And the answer is yes.  I may arguably have one of the most overtly blasphemous channels within our community, and my cartoons may seem like they're outrageously offensive just to be offensive.  but believe it or not, I make them the way I do for a good reason.  To understand why, we need to step back a moment and take a look at the big picture.  As stated in my previous Dumb Things video, and in my review of God's Not Dead, it's not like Christians are just sitting in the corner enjoying their nice little Bible stories when I walk over and take a shit on them with no provocation.  Rather, they, or at least the fundamentalist literalists, bring the Bible into our world.  Claiming it's the inerrant word of God, they propose that it instantly solves all the moral dilemmas the rest of us are working to untangle and then just expect everybody to live according to its dictates without question.  This is a huge demand to make.  It bypasses all discussion, automatically disrespects other people's efforts to actually understand and improve morality, and essentially tells the rest of the world, live your life how we say because we tell you to.  So given this absurd demand, why would we not pump the brakes and start asking questions about where the Bible came from and why we should obey it?  Why would we not read it over, carefully evaluating every word it said?  And if we found it to be barbaric, inconsistent, and absurd, why would we not mock it?  it seems like the most natural thing to do.  And given the demands Christians make of others using the Bible, it's kind of an important thing to do.  I mean, how do you thrust ideas into the public sphere and then demand people not react?  Many of us have spent years living under the thumbs of religious communities that told us to obey nonsensical rules, appealing to nothing more than the supposed infallibility of a book they couldn't properly justify, then telling us to shut up and quit asking questions if we asked them to justify it.  Sadly, many people, especially young people, are still trapped in this situation, and they really need our help.  They need to hear that the doubts they're having are legitimate.  And not only that, but the parts of the Bible they think are absurd are absurd.  That it's okay that they notice this, and they're not the only ones who do.  With every adult voice in their lives pressuring them not only to conform but believe, they need to hear other adult voices articulating all those little things they kind of notice but can't put into words.  Not necessarily to tell them they're right, but to assure them they're not alone and they shouldn't feel guilty or sinful just for noticing things.  And strategically placed sarcasm, leveled at ideas they may still feel intimidated and controlled by, is a vital part of that.  So yes, mockery is perfectly fair.  In fact, if you demand people not mock your ideas, especially ideas you use to wield authority over others, I kind of have to be suspicious about why.  And yes, this includes overtly mocking and humanizing God and Jesus.  I'm sorry, but those are not real people, at least from our perspective, which is important to understanding our intentions.  They are characters propped up as figureheads by people demanding unwarranted obedience from others.  So when I take them down a peg, when I show them being silly, it's not because I want to be a dick to Christians.  It's because they hold symbolic power over others and they need to be stripped of that power.  And what's wrong with this?  I mean, you don't get mad at Marvel for its lighthearted treatment of Thor and Loki and Odin, right?  And why not?  Because you hate and disrespect Norse culture?  No.  It's because you have a realistic sense of what these fictional characters are, and you're not too intimidated by them to evaluate them, have a little fun with them, and yes, when you feel like it, treat them like buffoons.  We should never be afraid to do this to any fictional character.  So when you expect the rest of the world to treat your characters with kid gloves, you're not expecting common courtesy.  you're demanding a frankly subservient level of respect for your religion that you would never expect for or offer to others.  And while we're on the double standard applied to literary characters, let's segue to the utter hypocrisy of Christians demanding others not mock their ideas, which is the part of this objection that's most obviously factually wrong.  Because let's be real, Christians aren't exactly gathered in their churches showing flowery levels of respect to atheists, right?  I mean, how often have you run into a group of evangelical Christians who don't crack wise about how we're so silly because we think the universe came from nothing or that our grandparents are apes or that a tornado could go through a junkyard and make a sports car?  The frankly insulting ideas they attribute to us without making the slightest effort to understand where we actually come from, and often after ignoring our attempts to explain where we come from, are nothing more than a form of mockery that's rolled off their tongue.  so naturally for so long I don't think they recognize how rude it is.  I've actually managed to build an entire series on these remarks.  It's called Dumb Things People Say to Atheists, and you're watching it now in case you didn't notice.  And if they want to mock us this way, that's fine.  We mock their ideas and they mock our ideas.  And honestly, I'm confident enough in what I believe that I think their mockery falls flat on its face and just shows they don't understand atheism and science.  So yeah, go ahead and keep it up, guys.  But the point is, we should all welcome a bit of mockery, in the right time and place, because when done well, it encourages good ideas to rise and bad ideas to fall.  But where we have a problem is when they want to throw their punches, then act all appalled whenever anybody swings back.  And really, we're not even talking about an even exchange here.  Because sadly, the examples I've listed above are some of the most polite things you'll ever hear most evangelicals say about atheists.  escalating things above the mutual mockery of ideas, many of them will go after us as people, and this is broadly tolerated to a horrifying extent.  I mean, have you ever heard the one about the atheist that was being attacked by a bear?  He asked God to make the bear Christian, because, you know, deep down he really believes, of course, so then the bear thanks God for his meal and eats the atheist.  Get it?  It's funny because the atheist dies a horrible death being eaten alive by a bear.  and we all know this isn't an isolated thing.  Just try to think of how many of these stories end up with an atheist being punched by a marine or humiliated in front of his peers or made to look stupid by a child or whatever, and you get the idea.  Along the same lines, look at the blatant character assassination that's considered acceptable in widespread Christian media.  God's not dead, the case for Christ, a matter of faith, let there be light... On and on and on, I could go through examples that not only misrepresent atheism, but degrade atheists as people by characterizing them as absurdly arrogant assholes with no basic sense of decency.  Seriously, stop to think about it for a second.  Think about the most savage ways that we mock Christianity, taking my God and Jesus cartoons for an easy example.  We go after Christian ideas, and yes, Christian literary characters, with both guns blazing.  And yes, some of this material can seem harsh to Christians.  I get that.  But do we ever go at their throats the way they go at ours?  Do we ever get nearly as personal as they do, portraying Christians as the horribly criminal psychopaths they depict us as and laughing at stories about their death and humiliation?  Even backing away from all that, just think of the broad narrative of the atheist-Christian clash, the one alluded to if not directly addressed in many churches and even codified in the Bible.  It takes a special kind of thought process to tell people they're denying God in their hearts because they're vile, that they have no foundation for morals, and that they're going to burn for eternity and deserve it, then feel like you should be the one who gets to feel offended if they poke a little fun at Jesus.  The double standard here is flatly absurd, and it's important to keep that in mind.  if Christians try to make you feel bad for mocking their ideas.  Thus, if a Christian ever asks, how dare you mock my faith, you can calmly and politely tell them, One, if they want to use their ideas to control others and affect public policy, then they should fully expect those ideas to be subject to scrutiny.  And yes, mockery.  Two, a little sarcasm helps people process ideas they felt wrongly controlled by.  And if they want to deal with their experience this way, they should have the freedom to do so.  Three, Christians ridicule people in far more cutting ways than they ever get ridiculed themselves, so it's a silly complaint anyway.  And finally, four, if you've ever mocked Christians in an inappropriate time, way, or place, you really should apologize and try to do better.  Because if we want Christians to clean their house, we should make sure ours stays clean too.  Look, if you're a Christian, no, I don't want atheists sitting in your living room.  But just like you have your churches, we need our space to process our experience with your religion however we see fit.  And you need to understand that your ideas themselves are not above criticism and even ridicule.  You need to understand the stress you put on people when you leverage social pressure or authority to demand they conform to religious doctrine they can't legitimately bring themselves to believe in.  And you need to understand that all they're looking for is a refuge they can run to to escape from, process, and yes, laugh at the evident absurdities.  you expect them to shape their minds around.  After you've spent years invading the deepest parts of their thought processes and telling them what they can and can't think, what they can and can't doubt, and what they must strain their minds to pretend to believe, you owe them that much privacy.  And if you're an atheist, especially one still boxed into a situation you can't escape from, you need to understand that you deserve that much privacy.  Nobody has any right to assert things they can't prove, then tell you you can't, in your own time and in your own place, just think differently than they do about it, even if you think their ideas are totally ridiculous.  And you do not deserve to feel shamed for trying to honestly figure out what you believe about a book other people consider holy.  Sure, Christians as people don't deserve to be laughed at, but Christianity certainly does. ",
