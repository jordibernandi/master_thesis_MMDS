And as one of the Greek philosophers pointed out, the problem is that God is very confusing in his instructions.  I mean, he says... One thing in the Old Testament, another thing in the New Testament, quite a lot of it isn't very nice.  Which are we to believe?  And this philosopher said, I mean, why did God send Jesus?  Was he like a complicated kind of legal codicil sent to say, oh, I said that earlier, but actually now.  Let's go with this. ",

This dignity manifests itself in several human rights, which now we claim have to be respected by all.  So at the end of the day, if dignity is a full expression of what a person is created to be and must become, if you want his project, of a soul being, then I would want to, anything that diminishes, Anything that becomes an obstacle, anything that detracts from this, we will begin then to acquire the face of what we don't want to call evil or something wrong or whatever type of thing.  And everything that promotes the dignity of a human person might be the type of thing that we'll be able probably to talk about in terms of goodness, in terms of virtue, in terms of anything like that.  If human persons, then I'll take dignity from his contribution, put the two together and say this probably will lead us towards an identification of what is evil, what is good in the life of a human person.

For instance, I could say very simply that When I look at dignity, I look at the human entity as a creature of volition.  Now, when you take away volition from a human being, and that, of course, covers even the experience of slavery, enslavement, et cetera, torture, and so on.  When you take volition away from a human being, that being is no longer a dignified person.  We cannot run away from the fact that the human being as a dignified being is defined by certain rights which can be set down in non-abstract terms like torture, you're reducing the dignity of that individual by torture and you're taking volition away.  A decision to participate in the politics on an equal basis, in the economic opportunities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, these are what constitute the dignity of the human being.  It's when we get to issues like evil that we're in trouble.  And that's where I'm hoping we'll get away, in this marvelous company, with this huge metaphysical question of my existence.  the evil, and if we get to the definition of what evil is, then those who commit acts that we define as evil, I move them away from the status of human beings.  And I reduce my recognition of what is acceptable as membership of the human community. ",

I completely agree, but relational is two, but it's more than two.  It's a society.  And so when one talks about dignity, one talks about the dignity of a society.
