            "text": "When we were Jehovah's Witnesses, we always used to brag about how if you come to our meeting, it's free.  No collections taken.  And I even remember like doing research and looking at, you know, like back in Judge Rutherford's day and they'd had those little play bills and they were always talking about everything is free.  And I remember going out in service years ago.  We always use the word free all the time.  You know?  Yeah, we did.  And so then I thought about it after we left and we just kind of like, you know, got a little critical thinking moment going on here this evening.  And so we had to jump in the camera this evening to kind of talk about what we were discussing about how we went from being free to like having these heavy burdens on us.  And it was like, wow, we didn't realize how much we had to pay and how much we had to give up.  And so we want to share those with you this evening.  So JT, you want to start out the gate? ",

            "text": "Yeah, we often refer to how everything was free.  And it's interesting that you really don't realize it until you actually leave the organization.  that while it wasn't free, it was a very, very high price that you had to pay.  I guess really it often starts with when a person first is introduced to Jehovah's Witnesses.  We used to ask that question to people as Bible studies.  Do you have one hour a week that you can spare for God?  And it's interesting how it starts off with one hour and it literally becomes your entire life that you have to give over to this religion.  And it impacts people and we see that.  We were discussing about the fact that all of the Witness kids that we grew up with, practically every single one, they are people who came around this organization in the late 60s, early 70s, our parents did.  And for the persons like myself and my wife, all the young people who we grew up with, we are now seeing our parents move into their golden years.  And for so many witness parents, they are suffering now.  They simply just were not prepared because they were waiting every day for the end to come.  And we just want to just go back over just how the watchtower basically ended up taking something from us that we cannot get back.  We were laughing about how you will often hear about persons who they reach a certain level of financial worth today.  And they may lose it.  And in time, we often hear they get it back.  But one of the things that you cannot get back, and that's time.  What they stole from us is time.  And that's something that we will never, ever get back.  Time and opportunities that we had at one time, they're gone. ",

And we would brag about how, oh, you know, we go to the Kingdom Hall and we just donate what we can afford to donate and all that.  But look at this guy over here.  You know, he's going to give a tenth of his earnings to his church.  And we kind of calculated it up and we talked about that.  And we said, well, you know what?  Let's just say the person made $50,000 a year.  They're going to their church and they pay $5,000 a year tithing.  So they got $45,000 left.  And we're talking about tithing on the gross.  But when you think about when a Jehovah's Witness gives up, then they'd be bragging, oh, we don't tithe, we don't do none of that.  Right?  But let's break it down.  What do we come up with, Jason?
