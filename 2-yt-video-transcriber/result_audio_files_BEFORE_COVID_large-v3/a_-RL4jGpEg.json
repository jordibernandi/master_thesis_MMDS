Apparently, this wasn't worth mentioning.  I mean, the omission of Columbus's involvement in the slave trade was possibly the biggest issue with his original video, and it was a big part of my response, but I guess it doesn't merit mention, even though it directly contradicts what he's saying.  Columbus's own intentions were here.  In my response video, I went through an entire sort of progression on Columbus's thoughts, personal thoughts on slavery.  You know, how he got his ideas on slavery, the points at which he talked about slavery, the ways in which he specifically tried to push the Spanish monarchs towards slavery.  And for a lot of this, you know, I used his own writings, which are about as close to showing us his intent as we can possibly get.  But Knowing Better has an opportunity here to set the record straight.  He's specifically making a new video to set the record straight here.  And he just glosses over this again.  He glosses over this entire very important fact about Columbus that most people don't really know about.  And this was an opportunity for him to kind of expose his audience to the fact that, yes, Columbus was a very enthusiastic slave trader.  And he intended to be a slave trader from the very beginning, pretty much.  And I mean, I don't know, I think that he would be more careful considering that, as I said in my response, his Columbus video was being used as sort of a white nationalist propaganda piece sometimes.  So I think it's kind of important that you mention these things in your sort of correction video to your original one.  And you know, all I can do is sit here and think, why would he leave that out again?  Why make the same massive glaring omission twice, man?  Come on.  If you don't want people making guesses at what your intentions are, then I think it's kind of important that you avoid this sort of thing.  Because all I can do right now is kind of make guesses about, you know, why did he do this again?  Even after he watched a video where a half a dozen quotes from Columbus saying, ah, you know, slaves, slaves are good, here's some slaves.  Hey, hey, king and queen, you want some slaves?  These people who have brought you a good example of slaves.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All of that sort of stuff.  And he just ignores it.  What am I supposed to think, man?

You know, this is not just us presenting two sides to every story here.  We know what Columbus fought because he wrote about his thoughts.  And we know that he wasn't playing around with them because he went and acted on those thoughts and initiated the transatlantic slave trade.  Again, I don't understand why he isn't mentioning this.  Why is the fact that Columbus was a huge slave trader just omitted?  I mean, I wasn't just saying these things offhandedly, like knowing better kind of does a lot.  I meticulously cited academic secondary sources and primary sources from Columbus's own journals and writings.  So it's not like he even needs to acknowledge me here.

He was also the second, and the third, and the fourth, and the fifth.  He shipped indigenous slaves from the Caribbean to Spain five times in six years, which is just about as much as he possibly could have in such a short period of time, considering the length and difficulty of the journey.  So, that further demonstrates his enthusiasm for the slave trade.  The first, as mentioned earlier, was a shipment of a few dozen slaves that he sent, unprompted, with a letter offering more.  The second, in 1495, was a much larger shipment.  The first ever large-scale movement of slaves across the Atlantic.  He had intended to ship 1,600, but he could only manage to cram 550 into the four ships that he had available.  Many of those who couldn't be loaded were instead given to the Europeans in the colony as slaves showing that there was, actually, regular ownership-style slavery in the colony alongside the encomienda system.  200 of them died during the trip.  Res\u00e9ndez writes that With this voyage, Columbus inaugurated the Middle Passage complete with the overcrowding and high mortality rates commonly associated with African slavery.  The third, in 1496, was a shipment of 300 slaves.  The fourth, in 1498, was a shipment of 800 slaves.  The fifth, in 1499, was a shipment of 300 slaves.  again That's about 2,000 slaves in five years.  He did not simply suggest a brutal system of forced labor that was worse than slavery.  He did not just try very hard to push the slave trade.  He put it all into practice of his own accord. ",

It's not that he's making a suggestion.  It's that he has to frame every little sort of thing that he's saying to them.  Because, you know, they're monarchs.  He's not allowed to make these sorts of direct statements to them.  The first translation that Knowing Better shows here was basically translated from bullshit to what he actually meant.  And not to mention that as I show in my video with a much more literal translation, the second translation here is actually not very good at all.  Again, let's ignore that though, I guess.  I gotta say, in Knowing Better's original video, he went to great lengths to delegitimize Bartolome de las Casas.  And in that original video, he specifically accused de las Casas of slavery, which, yeah, is true, while doing just about everything that he possibly could to absolve Columbus of the charge.  But in this video, I'm seeing more of the same.  Knowing better just glossed over Columbus's involvement in the actual transatlantic slave trade, as I mentioned earlier, he doesn't quite directly accuse Columbus of slavery.  He does place much more responsibility on Columbus than before for the encomienda system and its brutality.  But again, he kind of falls short of directly accusing Columbus of slavery.  But for de las Casas, he has, you know, there's no impulse for him not to do so.  He just goes right for it.  Again, he's watched my video where it was really emphatically shown that Columbus specifically participated in the slave trade and that he was the impetus for it to start.  But that doesn't bear mentioning while Bartolome de las Casas' involvement, who is basically, you know, a minor side character in this whole affair, does bear mentioning.  It's the same thing again.  So overall, what do I think about this response?  Look, the issue with Knowing Better's original Columbus video was not just or even mostly in its approach.  Far more than that is the fact that it's simply factually incorrect at best and lies by omission at worst.  So for him to make another video where he repeats a lot of the same glaring factual errors and makes many of the same omissions is really just not okay, especially since I know for a fact that he's watched my response video.  that corrects a lot of these problems.  Why leave out the fact that Columbus was an unambiguous slave trader who talked about slavery all the time with a ton of enthusiasm?  Why ignore the entire segment explaining why Columbus was the first transatlantic slave trader to instead mischaracterize the position of people who say that?  Why go so far to just avoid calling a spade a spade, dude?  Like, yeah, knowing better was saying that Columbus deserved responsibility and all of that, but he stops well short of actually admitting that he was wrong about these things.  admitting that he was wrong on the individual facts, admitting that he omitted extremely important evidence.  Most people don't know that Columbus was the first transatlantic slave trader.  Most people don't know that Columbus wrote so much about slavery.  Most people don't know that he specifically tried to push the Spanish crown towards the slave trade.  To leave all of this out after watching my video that stresses all of this, I don't know, why?  I think the most charitable interpretation here is that knowing better simply doesn't want to admit that he didn't really know that much about Columbus, that he was actually quite wrong on many of the basic historical facts.  So he's simply focusing solely on the approach, rather than simply coming out and admitting that he really did get many of the basic facts wrong, and that he specifically omitted a lot of the most damning evidence against Columbus, probably because he simply didn't know of its existence.  Anyway, that's my take on this.  Quite disappointed, but well, what can you do? ",
