            "text": "Shalom, shalom.  It's L. D. L. from One Nation, One Power.  Coming back to help you brothers and sisters out there in spiritual matters.  Like I said, I'm noticing a lot of attacks on spiritual people.  I mean, if you're out there and you're a witch, you deserve to be attacked.  Come on out of here.  But among us as Israel, we got those of us among us that are spiritual.  But I'm going to give you guys a heads up.  Because the Holy Spirit gave me this a long time ago.  And I'm going to give it to you.  You know, I don't take credit for nothing.  I don't take credit for none of these words that I bring to you.  Because I get them from the Most High.  I'm like Ezekiel.  Ezekiel said, I'm dumb until the Spirit of the Most High come upon me.  And that's how I live and that's how I operate, brothers and sisters.  So, we're going to go somewhere right fast.  It's going to be a short video.  But I'm going to give you some firepower.  I'm going to give you some fire power right now.  Right now I'm going to give you some fire power so you can go forward in your walk with the most heart.  But first off, you got to get some staticular fortitude.  You got to get some staticular fortitude to start looking at people in the eye.  Stop looking on the side of their head.  Stop looking up top of their head.  Start looking people in their eyes like you're looking at me in my eyes.  Are you hearing me out there?  I'm giving you some spiritual weaponry right now.  Start looking at people right in their eyeballs.  If you see their eyeballs change, they are a devil.  If you see their eyeballs change into looking like a cat, they are the devil.  Do you hear me out there?  We got so many people among us that right in our face, you're looking at them and you're trying to figure out why their pupils just went to looking like a cat's eye.  Both of them.  You're looking at a demon.  The demon is looking at you through them.  come on about here.  i'm sick and tired of these people coming on this channel and thinking we don't know what we're talking about.  now I'm going to give you some more firepower.  start looking at people dead in their eyes like you're looking at me in my eyes.  is this in the bible?  yeah it is.  he gave you a heads up but you know nobody else teaches spiritual things.  so I'm going to teach them go get your bible and go to Matthew chapter 6. we got so many people among us right now that when you're looking at them their eyes turn black.  They got on sunglasses.  They won't take off the sunglasses.  If you around somebody and every time you see them, they got on sunglasses, they trying to hide what's in there.  If it's 12 o'clock at night and you got a friend outside at 12 o'clock at night and he got on sunglasses, he trying to hide what he know what's in him.  Hello, if you got a sister, and every time you see her, she got on sunglasses, she don't want you to see her soul or her eyes.  But Yeshua gave us some information on the eyes.  Let's go into it right now.  Matthew chapter 6, verse number 22.  The light of the body is the eye.  The light of the body is the what?  The eye.  The light of the body is the what?  The eye.  Look in my eye.  Do you see light in my eye?  You see light in my eye.  That is the light of the body.  The greater that light get in your eye, the greater the Holy Spirit is in your life.  When you look at somebody and you don't see no light in their eye, in their eyes you'll see no light in their eyes.  you're looking at a dead soul by even a person with no soul.  this is how we're going to identify clones in this hour too but you're going to have to get some particular fortitude and start looking at people in their eyes if you don't see no light in their eyes.  and this ain't coming from the light from this computer.  I worked hard to apply this verse to my life, to get the light in my eyes, in my soul.  That's why I pray daily.  Everything I teach you guys, I do it myself.  For 20 years now, I've been praying on my knees every day.  I've been confessing my sins every day because I understood Matthew 6 and 22, that the light of the body is the eye.  It's not your face.  It's not your complexion.  I hear people out there saying, oh, he's glowing.  Now, don't look at the glow on the face.  Look in the eye.  Because Satan can glow too.  Verse 22.  The light of the body is the eye.  The light of the body is the eye.  The light of the body is the eye.  The light of the body is the eye.  If therefore thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  Where is the light going to come from?  The eyes.  The eyes.  The eyes.  Time to get some particular fortitude in your life.  Stop looking at the ground.  Stop being a coward.  And start looking these people in their eyes.  You want to know who the devil is among you?  Look them in their eyes.  Look and see if you see some light inside of them.  If you don't see no light inside of them, there's something else inside of them.  Because we're going to keep on reading and the Bible is going to teach us a spiritual weapon and a spiritual lesson on how to operate among other people.  You want to get discernment?  I'm giving you discernment.  Matthew chapter 6 verse 22.  The light of the body is the eye.  If therefore thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  Verse 23.  But if thy eye be evil, but if thy eye be evil, but if thy eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.  Their eyes are going to be dark.  You ain't going to see no light in their pupils.  It's just going to be dark.  Now we're going to separate God's children from the devil's children.  How about this?  Because most of these people out here that have been in the mirror looking at themselves and watched their own eyes change.  If you've ever been in that situation and you've seen your own eyes change, you hit your knees and you fast and you pray.  And you tell the most, I'll get that devil out of you.  There's no more time to be playing games, brothers and sisters.  All these Hebrews and Christians tiptoeing around each other.  All you got to do is look them in the eye.  I've been doing this for years.  When I first got here on this mountain, they knew I wasn't from here.  They said, man, he looked people dead in his eyes.  I'm trying to see who you are.  I'm trying to see who I'm talking to.  I'm trying to see who's standing before me.  Like you should be doing.  verse twenty-two and twenty-three together the difference between the light and dark.  verse twenty-two the light of the body is the eye.  if therefore thy eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light if they're single.  is that if you being right with God If you're being right with God, if you're confessing your sins, you're doing right with the Most High, you're acknowledging your downfalls, you're standing up tall, you're repenting, you're humbling yourself, your eyes are going to be full of light.  But if thy eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.  If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness.  How great is that darkness.  Now he's telling you that if you're looking in the mirror at yourself and you see your eyes are dark, he's saying how great is it.  He's saying how much darkness do you have in you?  How many demons are you dealing with?  Every brother or sister that have the Holy Spirit, that's living right and walking right, going to have light in their eyes.  This is Matthew chapter 6, verse 22 and 23.  I've even preached where my eyes have gotten so bright that it scared the hell out of people.  Your eyes are supposed to have light in it, brothers and sisters, because the Holy Spirit that's living in you is from the light.  I'm preaching and teaching, I'm giving a revelation right now.  How great is the light in you, or how great is the darkness.  This is El Dahliel from One Nation One Power, bringing another level of spiritual awareness and authority to our brethren.  Look them in the eye to find out who they are.  Look past their mitrines.  Look past their phylacteries.  Look past their stares and look them in the eye.  Look them in the eye when they're talking about the Most High.  And then you'll find out and you will know for sure who in them and who not in them.  This is El Dair for One Nation, One Power.  Look me in my eye.  Shalom. ",
