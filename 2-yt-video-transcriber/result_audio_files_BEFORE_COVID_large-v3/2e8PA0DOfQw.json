            "text": "now as you guys probably anybody watching social media today seen this crazy brawl with two families fighting at disney world.  however let's be clear.  we not the only ones out fighting someone.  Mark and Craig, Pop Brothers at Law.  We've been warning people, if you are working for an unlicensed dispensary... Alright, so... I just wanted to get that disclaimer out there.  And this is going viral.  This is going everywhere.  Us, them.  And it's an embarrassment.  Of course, when we... Act a fool like this in public, it gets more publicity than the one I just showed you guys.  This is already at two, three million YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, everywhere.  Come on, families.  You know what?  It's an embarrassment to us all.  And it makes us all look bad.  You know, when you get grown, especially 30 plus, Any issues that you may have, you walk away.  I think that men are a little better nowadays at walking away from trouble, from BS.  It's the woman provoking this situation here.  You can see her and some guy getting into it tough.  We don't know what happened before.  But you can see that that woman spit on that man.  Take a look at this.  I want to say this, you know, women.  In the 90s, it was a phase of Never hit a woman, of course.  Never put your hands on a woman.  But however, a lot of women took that as like, oh, y'all don't ever put your hands on a woman so I can hit you, I can spit on you, I can treat you any way I feel.  And after about 10, 20 years in 2000, 2010-ish, a lot of men was like, wait a minute, hold your horses.  Don't put your hands on me either.  And that's true.  Women, just because it's no men should put their hands on a woman, don't mean that you should put your hands on a man.  Vice versa.  Both ways.  Neither one of y'all should be putting your hands on each other.  But my thing is this, and this is just a typical, a lot of people say, Hey, let the video play.  Watch it on YouTube, Facebook or something.  I mean, it's just typical two people, families, fuss feud fighting.  You can see that all day down Facebook.  I will show you a little bit more of this clip and try to come into it.  But I want to make my point first.  Once you grown, Especially with your kids.  There's a video of a man shooting into a car.  When you have your kids with you, especially, walk away.  It ain't worth it.  In public.  Even if you're by yourself.  I came in a situation in the bowling alley where I damn near got into it.  It almost got ugly.  And it would've.  And who knows where it would have went.  You know, with people drinking.  I concealed a carry.  I had that in my car.  The off-duty police officer had that on him.  Turns out the DJ had something on him.  That could have went really ugly.  And it's a good thing that cooler heads prevail.  We just both, you know, it ain't worth it.  Over some BS, it ain't worth it.  Somebody say something to you out in public, just walk away, people.  Just walk away.  I show some of y'all that want to that want to watch this.  I would show y'all some of it.  Oh, my God!  My thing is this man, and this is one of the reasons why I ate that.  um that this reality TV crap.  It's, you know, in the early 90s when I was a kid, I used to, when my parents and older adults used to say that this music is influencing these children, these music, movies, and reality TV shows, stuff like that influences these kids, it does.  And we're seeing more.  ladies, women, this is just pure ignorance, pure ignorance.  And it's very embarrassing.  This is all on the news, ABC7 Chicago.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it was them that shared it.  Other news stations are sharing this.  At the end of this, you're going to see him beat his own woman down.  Hey, hey!  So he's saying she hit his mother.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Where did that happen?  Where did she get knocked down?  The mother.  She trying to help his mother, what you talking about?  Idiot.  She didn't hit his mother?  That idiot.  She was trying to help.  She was trying to help his mother.  The big girl who was already fighting with him was trying to swing at her and the mother got in the way.  But why would you try to beat your own girl down in front of your mother when your mother's there?  This is the type of dysfunction... we must learn to walk away from.  Stuff like this will end up in people getting shot and killed in the streets.  That's why it's so important for us to be able to be inside of our schools because a lot of these fights that start inside these schools spill out into the streets.  The dysfunction that we see inside the schools and our personal lives spill out in these streets and people get killed.  This is the type of dysfunction you must learn to walk away from, young men, boys.  Once you get older to a particular age, this type of stuff is the type of stuff that you learn to walk away from.  It ain't worth it.  When you see stuff like this, just walk away.  When you get into it on the streets, Somebody says something to you.  Somebody says something to your girl.  But especially, especially people in front of your kids.  Good God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, do me a favor.  I've got her.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Come and sit down.  Come and sit down.  Come and sit down.  Come and sit down.  It was jumping on you all the time.  Now here it is, y'all done.  spent all this money getting into this park for your kids to enjoy themselves.  Repeat, for your kids.  You go to Disneyland for your kids, people.  You spend four, $5,000 flying to Florida for your children to enjoy themselves.  You don't act a damn fool in public.  Come on, people.  Let's hear from Chris Rock.  Let me have my celebrity guest.  Let's see what Chris Rock has to say about this issue.  What do you got to say, Chris Rock?  Let me hear it.  Niggas have got to go.  Every time black people want to have a good time, ignorant-ass niggas fuck it up.  Can't do shit without some ignorant ass niggas fucking it up.  Can't do nothing.  Can't keep a disco open more than three weeks.  Grand opening, grand closing.  Can't go to a movie the first week it come out.  Why?  Because niggas are shooting at the screen.  What kind of ignorant shit is that?  Hey, that's a good movie.  That's so good, I got to bust a cap in here.  need I continue?  this is one of the reasons why I talk so much against the music that we're listening to.  I got partners.  this would be common sense.  common sense that you do not bump some of these this music that these children uh... promote this shooting killing ammo dysfunction around your children.  this should be common sense for them not to be listed to the summit on a daily basis.  this is what i mean.  some of the african countries.  they have a moral police which is dead government technically in the college of the more police whenever one of these celebrities jump on on the stage.  there was a woman who jumped on instagram but they keep twerking this, that, and the other.  She was a celebrity.  They shut her down.  I like that.  Why?  Now, that's freedom of speech here in America.  That's cool.  But I like that moral police because now what happens?  I got to raise my child.  I got to send her to school with people that think it's cool to gladiate, fight, fuss through, fight at little everything.  I got to send my children in an environment like this.  Yes, you can raise your child certain way but then when they get out into this world they have to see something else and you got one bad apple spoil a bunch.  and then if these kids think it's okay as soon as you say something let's let's fight it out opposed to talk it out.  and if your parents can't even have the decency enough to talk it out then what do you think the children are gonna learn?  see how many children watch that.  both families children set.  watch the whole thing.  Both those parents should be ashamed of themselves.  Anyway, this is my motto here.  How long are you going to cry and blame your oppressor before you get up off your knees and do it your goddamn self?  Yes, in our communities we must have our own morals, our own code of ethics, and raise the standards.  Did that make us all look bad?  Yeah, it did.  It did.  This is what people are looking at us saying.  Ah, see, we got to raise the price on Disneyland now to keep the ignorant fools out.  Anyway, I want you guys to like, comment, let me know what you think about this video.  Peace, peace.  ... ... ",
