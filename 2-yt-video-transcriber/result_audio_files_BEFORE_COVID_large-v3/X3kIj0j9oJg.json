            "text": "Thank you for coming, Dr.  Craig.  I really appreciate it.  My question concerns the issue of natural evil that you brought up in response to one of those objections.  And my basic question is, I would object to your response by saying you propose this third proposition that God can justify natural evil if there's some morally sufficient reason to justify it.  For example, making a world in which people can know him.  But if God is all powerful, then he could fulfill this morally sufficient reason, for example, having people know him through any mean.  He could create any universe without natural evil that would fulfill this morally sufficient reason because by definition he is all powerful. ",

            "text": "God's being all powerful doesn't mean that he has the ability to do logically impossible things.  And it's logically impossible to make someone do something freely.  So given human freedom, we don't know that there is a world that's feasible for God in which he could bring as many people to eternal life and salvation freely as this world or worlds suffused with natural evil and suffering.  The atheist would have to prove that there's a possible world that God could have actualized of free creatures in which more persons or greater percentage of persons would freely come to find salvation and eternal life, but without an equivalent amount of suffering.  And that's pure speculation.  Nobody know such a thing.  So I think that the atheist argument just lays a burden of proof so heavy on the atheist shoulders that no one can sustain it. ",

            "text": "You're asking... Why couldn't God create a universe of free creatures in which just as many people come to know him and his salvation, but with less natural evil in it?  And I'm saying that we have no idea whether such a world is feasible for God or not, given human freedom.  There are possible worlds like that, but they may not be actualizable or feasible for God because the human persons wouldn't cooperate.  They wouldn't do what God would want them to do.  So the burden of proof lies upon the atheist to show that there is a feasible world like that available to God, and there's simply no way to prove that.  Now, let me come back on your earlier point.  Suppose you do say that omnipotence means the ability to do the logically impossible.  Then the problem of evil immediately evaporates because God can bring it about, that he is all powerful, all good, and that natural evil exists, even though that's logically impossible.  No problem.
