            "text": "Okay, and the warning should only be issued if a citizen is committing a crime on public property.  So it could be any whim that anybody has in the public office when they don't want transparency?  Correct.  That's tyranny, sir.  I'm sorry.  Arbitrary tyranny.  Have a good day.  Honor your oath.  I do honor my oath.  Not now.  Right's Crispy here at the tax collector.  In Imperial Polk County, it's really called that.  And this used to be the original Publix, I believe.  Anyways, I'm here with News Now South Florida and Eyes on the State.  Checking to see what we the people can see.  Wow.  Oh my gosh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's 1831.  That's station 31.  She's been watching us, the girl in the red flannel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Hi.  I'm sorry?  Oh, is this restricted?  Oh, I didn't see any signage.  Yes, please.  Okay.  You're going to get the policy?  Oh, okay.  It's not clearly marked, so I have to see that.  Okay.  I'll wait.  Is she coming?  Okay.  Okay.  You're with this other gentleman over here, correct?  I'm an independent journalist, sir.  You're not with the other guy with the camera?  I'm not with anyone.  Can we get another copy?  Okay.  Here's the copy of the rules that you requested.  What's your name and badge number, please?  Andrew, 6322.  Thank you.  The gentleman over here also requested it, so I'll give him one as well.  Yeah, I just didn't see any clear markings that it's restricted.  That's why I just wanted to see.  So this says that through the corridor anywhere?  You just can't go back there because of confidential information.  And it says that in here?  Yes, this is for your viewing pleasure.  You can read it at your leisure.  You can take this with you.  Okay, well... The reason we do this is to challenge, you know... I have no problem with that.  And this is not satisfying.  I don't see that this is saying that I'm entering a restricted area there.  You understand?  I'm not the manager.  I don't make the rules here.  Okay.  All right.  Well, you're a law enforcement officer, right?  Let's enforce the law, sir.  Not rules.  Not a rule enforcement officer.  He doesn't want to hear it.  Now serving together at station two.  Sir, quick question.  Can you show me in here what I'm supposed to find?  that says that that's a restricted area?  Can you point that out, please?  Because I really don't know.  I couldn't see it.  Public areas of issuance include the lobby area and areas forward of the sliding glass doors.  Okay.  All right.  Excluding areas behind closed doors where customer transactions occur.  Right.  Which is behind these doors here.  There's no videotaping on side A, side A, side B, behind the scheduling area, which is right over here, or in the testing area located behind sliding glass doors, which is behind here in the center.  Unless pre-approved by DHSNB.  Okay, so there is a state statute on here?  That's a policy.  Okay, so it's not a law.  They sent it to me.  Right.  Yeah, we have to judge that.  We follow the law, not policies that are for you.  This is really for you, though.  Correct.  That's our policy.  That's for you guys.  driver's license identification, which is also quoted on here.  Right, and the onus is on you.  Right, that is on you to protect it.  We've got to make sure that you flip files over, that you have the screen covering the computer that we can't see.  So this applies to you, not us.  Okay.  So I got with my manager as well as my director in the back about you guys.  We're happy to have you here.  Feel free to be here.  It's we the people.  We pay for this.  We're happy to have you here.  Just like I said, though, if you guys do go behind the closed doors, we would have to ask you at that point.  So like I said, you're more than welcome to videotape to whoever you are.  But if we, Deputy, if we pass through those doors, would we be committing a crime?  Okay, so to be asked to leave from public property, doesn't one have to commit a crime?  Well, that's not a crime, but that's not a crime.  I'm not going to get in an argument with you.  No, we're not going to argue.  I'm just trying to ask for clarification because I do want to exercise my rights to the fullest.  I don't want to be infringed on my rights.  You understand?  I'm okay with that.  So these policies are not the law.  I follow the law.  You are a law enforcement officer, not a policy enforcement officer.  So let's... I'm not going to debate this with you.  That's what's going to happen today.  So if I go in there, you're going to give me a criminal trespass warning.  I'm going to give you a verbal trespass warning.  If you don't leave after I ask you to leave, then you'd be violating a crime by trespassing after the warning.  Okay, and the warning should only be issued if a citizen is committing a crime on public property.  So it could be any whim that anybody has in the public office when they don't want transparency?  Correct.  That's tyranny, sir.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Arbitrary tyranny.  Have a good day.  Honor your oath.  I do honor my oath.  Not now.  Coming through.  Excuse me, sir?  Yes, sir.  Sir.  Yes, sir.  I need you to leave.  Okay, you want me to leave?  I do want you to leave.  Please leave.  Don't put your hands on me.  Please leave.  Please leave.  Okay.  He didn't touch me.  Please leave.  All right.  Are you giving me a trespass warning?  I'm asking you to leave.  Are you giving me a verbal trespass warning?  Yes.  I'm asking you to leave.  And your name and badge number again?  Andrew 6322.  Okay.  We told you not to come back here.  You did.  Please leave.  Right.  And that's not a crime?  It's putting other people's information, confidential private information, at risk.  Okay.  Okay?  So are you... Please leave.  If you give me a trespass warning, I will leave.  It's a verbal trespass warning.  That's what we do in the county.  There's nothing written.  There's no written trespass warning?  No, sir.  Oh, okay.  It doesn't have to be.  All right, so I'm putting you on notice.  You're violating my civil rights.  This is prior restraint.  You lose your qualified immunity in this situation, you know that?  Okay.  Thank you for this information.  Yeah, you're on notice.  Thank you.  Okay.  You don't mind?  I'm telling you to leave.  Okay.  All right.  Just clarifying.  We're asking you to go back here to protect people's confidential practice.  And it's my right to see how we are spending our money.  And you are blocking... And you can go back and see that without a camera.  No, I need to record it.  I have a bad memory and I suck at drawing.  Tyler, I need Tracy or somebody.  If you guys want him to leave, I'll make it happen.  Oh, wow, you just solicited a trespass?  That's against the law.  That is against the law, sir.  I work at the discretion of the tax collector here today.  Okay, and you do not solicit a trespass?  I work for them at this point.  You just solicited a trespass.  You said, get Tracy, I'll make them leave if you want.  That's soliciting a trespass.  Hi.  I don't think he understands how long.  That's right, Western Slope.  He just did it live on camera.  He did it on a live feed right there.  Yep.  Estamos en vivo.  You should knock.  See if Officer... Esto es un servicio p\u00fablico que nosotros hemos pagado.  Y es como yo diga.  Es como usted diga aqu\u00ed.  No es como \u00e9l diga.  Nosotros somos los que mandamos.  He's coming back, man.  You locked customers out of that office.  Customers are welcome.  Yeah, deputy, there's a customer.  Oh, she left?  Yeah, we have multiple doors, but I'm protecting their private information right now.  I'm not trying to get any private information.  How's everything going?  Great.  My name's Chris Jaramillo.  I'm Finn.  Pleasure to meet you.  Mr.  Jaramillo.  How you doing?  Nice to meet you.  Jaramillo?  Yeah, Jaramillo.  How can I help you, gentlemen?  Well, I just wanted to make sure everybody's taken care of in a timely fashion.  I don't want to get any private information.  No doubt about that.  And the deputy just gave me a verbal trespassing.  Okay.  Which is really not allowed.  There's a policy that applies to all of the employees here that the onus to protect private information is on you.  If I happen to get it on my camera, which I'm not trying to do, that's a violation of the Privacy Act that you have committed or your employees have committed.  I cannot be committing that crime because I wasn't given the training, such as like HIPAA law in a hospital or whatever.  So Smith v. City of Cumming, this is very important, sir, 11th Circuit Court, District Court of Appeals, covers Georgia and Florida, City of Cumming and Georgia.  Smith went in there.  He says he wants to record government employees on the government dime for matters of public interest.  And that's what we're doing.  So prior restraint is what this deputy just committed.  He just stopped me.  He said, I'm not leaving until you give me a written trespass warning or you actually want to threaten me with arrest.  If you're threatening me with arrest, I'll leave right now.  But I'm not going to leave until I get my story and my rights should not be infringed.  Well, I appreciate it.  Thanks for giving the heads up on that.  Thank you, sir.  So our main concern is we don't, obviously, the front area is all fair game.  I think you understand that.  Anywhere around there, especially around the schedule, there's also private information.  So I think you got that.  We don't want understanding that you've already went inside here.  Yes.  We don't want you going inside there.  Okay.  Obviously, there's private information.  You're aware of security, driver's license information.  Driver's license are actually handed out in the test area.  Right, that's it.  In here?  Anywhere around here?  This way?  That's fair game.  And we want to make sure you feel that your rights are not violated.  I appreciate you.  And just for fun and for free, a little bit of education.  The one thing that you can do to stop me and stop anybody else that comes in here with a camera is put a little sign right here that says restricted area.  That's all you have to do is make a sign.  That's it.  And it'll save you a lot of money out of your own pocket.  Well, I appreciate you giving me the information to say just another sign.  Yeah.  Okay, I can appreciate that.  All right.  Thank you very much for coming.  Thank you, Mr.  Jaramillo.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Honor your oath.  No hard feelings.  You got any hand sanitizer?  Oh, am I gross?  You have some in your squad car?  There's some up here in the counter.  Can we get some?  Thank you.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Appreciate that.  No, there's none up here?  Can I have some hand sanitizer, please?  I see a big jug of it right back there.  Oh, you got some here?  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  I appreciate it.  What's your name, ma'am?  Pamela.  Pamela.  Stay professional.  Professional.  And have a terrific 2020.  Yeah.  You look good.  You look really good.  She's a stellar employee right there.  And he was very helpful as well.  He broke it down for me.  I was just wondering where does it say this, and he showed me.  I appreciate it.  Thank you for the suggestion.  Yeah, that's all it takes.  By law.  We follow the law, and we're looking for rights violations along with other violations.  Okay.  Thanks again.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  Yeah, I'm always going in there when I need to.  Right.  Anywhere that the public is allowed to go, so am I with my camera.  Exactly.  Freedom of the press.  Exactly.  First of all.  Hey, I've just gone in there to look around before.  Right, right.  Yeah, and I don't want any private information for what?  Plus, there's a bathroom back there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, so you've got to go in there to go to the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  That makes sense, yeah.  All right, folks.  Hey, thanks a lot, man.  All right, bye.  Take. ",
