I have been up since about a quarter to four this morning.  Went with my brother, Miggy.  Not actually my brother, but my boy.  We went to the airport in Riga, in Latvia.  Flew out to Vienna.  Then we got a car at Vienna and drove all the way down the Autobahn to this amazing, incredible, beautiful place called Tranzi in Austria.  You can see the backdrop here, these mountains.  this beautiful water.  it's just gorgeous and warm.  across the top you can see the fish swimming.  you can see ahead of you underwater.  this is just a whole new world and i'm just so humbled and grateful to be here and i know there's some of you guys that are going through hard times right now.  i know there's some of you guys that are loving life right now but i was in a hard place a couple of years ago and i just wanted to let you know that You know, you've just got to explore your opportunities.  You've got to take a chance.  Sometimes you've just got to say yes to something that's sitting in front of you.  Don't wait your whole life for a moment like this.  Don't wait your whole life hoping that someone's going to come up to you and say, hey, do you want to go here? ",
