            "text": "Oh, Cherry Star, are you watching?  It's the Maccabees Alliance Unified in their control All black, it's the Mac Unified 100 soldiers ready for war, who wanna ride?  It's that Maccabean spirit restoring the tabernacle.  No more shackles, get down or lay down, you dig?  No more weak niggas selling their souls for massive bums.  Run up in your trunks, smack lives off of your pants As a slum, do this for the people trapped in the slums and losing focus.  Destruction's at America's doorstep.  It ain't another four left.  Donald Trump, you coward.  A space force for what?  You can't stop your hour.  200 million chariots huffing over your tower.  We don't know the hour, but soon you'll feel the power.  He's just like a gay boy.  A nurse who's got it in for me.  still be don't worry it's okay boy cause it's gonna be what it was meant to be.  I walk the water, walk the lava, bow mouth preacher, the gold prayer solid.  I'm sipping on Moscato in the hills of Masada.  Yo, I'm popping up a bottle for the boys in Granada.  So look to the max, we need to step and focus on it.  I rise above the savagery and mastery nirvana.  And deep inside the Vatican, it gets the black Madonna, I'm dressed in all black again, the AOC persona, them crackers getting slapped again, shout out to y'all with Connor, got my guns from an African, all the way in Ghana, it's time for me to clap again, it's time for us to conquer, my wolves are wild and woke, my lions and piranhas, the Bible we do broke, but still bustin' llamas at the frickin' merge smoke, feel a room like marijuana, I'm comin' for they throat, Tell them devils I'm in karma, I just meant to be, it's prophecy from Jesus Christ.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  This right here, we shoot the video for this.  Featuring my man right here, man.  AOC Daniel Allen.  It's called Israel, right?  And my son, Ellie.  Let's bring it to you.  You ready?  Y'all ready?  Y'all join y'allself, man, on this sunny afternoon.  Long Beach, California.  Can I get a little volume?  Just a little volume.  No, please.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Oh, we were chosen as a special race.  And the Mars and the K was raised fast.  But that is shame, I'm without praise, that a daddy standin' face to face, I forgot forever, Israel, Israel, Israel.  So that's a special grace, that a body hit his grave, Israel.  Without his name I would never praise.  To the day we stand and face to face.  I'm forever reppin'.  Israel, Israel, Israel People rather be segregated, gestilated To black to be black, be independent, degraded Through the cellar, no pressure, we stand and test the time Still willin'.  nobody is blessed as I am And this time is great, we turn for a second time.  Game's over for you, ye that you fear it.  You'll have a lack of strength, so be it.  I'm ready for war, I'm ready for war, I'm ready for war, I'm ready for war.  All the way to Korea.  We the players.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  It's crazy. ",
