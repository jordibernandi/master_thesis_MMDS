            "text": "I think the important thing here is the psychological impact of the consistency of sending these special operation guys to war.  There's a reason that, you know, Ranger Battalion deployments are about four months, you know, SEAL ones are about six months, is because the operational tempo and consistent war that these guys are having to go through and see day after day after day, it can weigh on you.  And so I think instead of having politics involved in war where we're trying to burn guys in the special operations community, we have to be proactive and say, how do we get them the help that they need?  Because for You know, a lot of us joined at 17 and spent a decade training for war and very, very violent war.  And for us just to say, just, you know, turn a cold shoulder to them when a blemish on a career of a great career story, it's a terrifying thing.  And Eddie made a great point in there.  It's about the guys that are still serving today.  Are we going to hold them to an unreal standard and expect them to involve politics in their war, which will get people killed overseas? ",

            "text": "Leadership's the answer.  Where's the leadership?  coming in and defining what the exact problem is and taking proactive steps to resolve it.  so we're not having cases like this going forward.  People that join any branch of the service or special operations are willing to step up to the plate.  That's why we signed up for.  that job is by any means necessary.  How do we get the mission done?  But I think it's very reflective.  in today's society, even when we look at the transitional component of people getting out of the military and how unpresent we are there as a country.  And I think that's why we've been so proactive with our company is how do we look out for our own?  You know, I got out of the military, but I still have friends that are in tier one units that I served with, you know, 10, 15 years ago.  And so how do we look out for these guys?  And Again, it's just like progressive politics that are trying to fry and paint this picture of moral and ethic problems within the special operations community.  Like, did we all forget?  These are the guys right now strapping on night vision to go out and hunt the worst enemies of America right now.  That's what they're doing.  You have some political elitist sitting as progressive ivory tower trying to define the culture and ethics and morals of a special operations community, who those individuals, if they heard a gunshot from afar, they'd be triggered.  They have no understanding or realization of what war is like.  And I've seen a decent amount of war, but my service is a microcosm of what people are still doing over there.  I mean, like Evan said, there's people with 20, 30, 40 deployments in Tier 1 units.  I mean, it's ridiculous for me to think that people can sit there and try to articulate and rationalize with what war is like when they've never been to war.  I've been on target where we've gotten ambushed and you've engaged enemy combatants, they're wounded on target, and the guy that was just trying to shoot you in the face, you have to walk over there and heal him, put aid on him, and then send him to get saved by taxpayer dollars.  We're out there doing your moral stuff. ",
