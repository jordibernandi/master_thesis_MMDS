So people who find this hard to believe, and I understand many people find this hard to believe, can check the records.  When Donald Trump got his first casino, Trump Plaza, which opened in May of 1988, he needed helicopter service to bring in high rollers from New York and Connecticut and Baltimore and elsewhere.  Other casinos went to established helicopter companies.  Donald Trump avoided all of them and instead went to a company called Damon Aviation, which was connected with a mobbed up firm that made high interest loans to people and was financed mostly with New Jersey government bonds as part of our corporate socialism in America.  And it was headed by a twice convicted felon and mob associate named Joseph Wexelbaum.  In the fall of 1985, so we're not that much further into the future, Donald Trump's general counsel for his casino, or one of his casinos, got a phone call that Joe Exelbaum had been arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration.  Eventually, Wexelbaum not only pled guilty, he confessed.  He made a long, detailed confession about how he was importing cocaine and marijuana from Columbia to Florida and then having it driven up to Cincinnati, Ohio to be distributed.  Donald Trump, as a casino owner, should have cut all ties with this man at that point.  Do you think?  Yeah.  Well, as a casino owner particularly, he needs to cut ties with him.  He has not been convicted, however, yet, until the point that his confession was accepted by the court. ",

But it was transferred to Newark, New Jersey, and to the courtroom of newly appointed federal judge Mary Ann Trump Berry, Donald's older sister.  Whoa.  A woman who flew in the helicopters of this drug trafficker, and in fact flew in Donald's personal helicopter when Joe Exelbaum was the pilot.  Now think about that for a moment.  We had a sitting federal judge.  who got her appointment thanks to Roy Cohn's connections to the Republican administration in the White House.  A sitting federal judge flying around in the helicopters of a confessed, very big-time cocaine trafficker.  The case was then moved to another judge, which is what should happen.  But nonetheless, the message in the courthouse is pretty clear.  If you were the chief judge, Tom, in Newark, New Jersey, when you heard about this, you would have gone nuts saying, God, I hope the newspapers never hear about this.  This is a disaster.  Joe Wexelbaum got 18 months.  You know what the drivers, the mules got for driving the drugs up from Florida to Cincinnati? ",

He tells his probation officer that he's going to go back to work for Donald Trump as his helicopter guy, and that he is going to move into Trump Tower.  And somehow with no underwriting by a bank, Joe Wexelbaum's girlfriend got a double apartment in Trump Tower with a $2.4 million mortgage.  And by the way, Wexelbaum said he couldn't afford to pay his federal fines of $30,000, and all he did was pay three checks of $200 each.  Now, there's a lot more to this story that I tell in the book, but given that level of entanglement, I'm gonna add one more element.  Donald Trump wrote a letter to be used by the sentencing judge in which he characterized Joe X. Obama as a credit to the community, a stand-up guy who shouldn't serve any time because he was such a good guy.  And when New Jersey casino regulators found out about it, the detectives went and asked Trump, who denied writing such a letter, When they got the letter and came back, his answer was, well, that's my signature, but I don't remember writing that letter.  Now, you remember Donald Trump on the campaign said he had the world's greatest memory.  Right.  And the casino control regulators then did an investigation based on my report in the Philadelphia Inquirer about Wayne Barrett's biography of Trump, which had this story in it.  they concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to establish anything.  And that's because the casino regulators, to all owners, not just Trump, had an unwritten policy.  Never ask a question, the answer to which would force you to go after the license of a casino owner.  And so Trump skated on this.  But I think the evidence here is so clear that I've said, and I'll say again with you, I think that Donald was involved in the cocaine trafficking business with Joe.  And Donald, if you're listening, if you think I just slandered you, sue me. ",
