So he's going to look up the statute here, and I'm going to go live.  Oh, come on.  So I'm out here.  I was just looking.  You guys are just joining in.  There's basically, I've got Officer Merrick here with me, and... The other day, code enforcement had a vehicle that was just absolutely trashed.  And basically, there's feathers in it.  There was all kinds of stuff in the car.  Just a nightmare inside of it.  And today, I was down here.  I've got my phone and my controller and my drone in my hand.  I'm not even flying the drone.  And Officer Merrick decides to come up and pretty much Detain me.  He says he's detaining me here, so I'm not sure.  I asked him if he suspects me of a crime.  He says I have to find out and make sure.  He's going in there and looking at a statute.  And he's checking to see if I filed a flight plan with my drones here.  But yeah, if you don't know the laws or anything, like the FAA Modernization Act says that no governments can make any laws against the recreational use of drones.  So I'm sitting down here, and Officer Merrick right down here, if you guys, he got a supervisor coming, but he's officially said I'm detained, but he doesn't know what the reason for the detainment is.  Says he's got to find out.  He's a pilot as well.  He identified himself as a pilot.  So I don't know.  He said that now I'm conducting surveillance on a police department.  So basically, we're trying to figure out if, you know, when you're in the air, the only place you can't fly drones is when you're over prisons.  And, you know, I'm not over here conducting anything like that.  But anyway, Tom's on his way with a drone.  I'm down here at the Port Orange Police Department.  uh... right in front of it actually.  so they've got a gated clear open fence right over here and uh... and basically that's uh... that's what we're dealing with.  he's got me detained uh... saying that there's a suspicion of a crime and uh... i'm trying to figure out what that crime is.  guys be careful.  there's an airplane that's flying right over so i don't know if he's gonna do anything about that or not.  but we work under the same laws as uh... as the uh... as the airplane's there.  I'm going to ask him if I can get out of here because I don't know.  Officer Merrick?  Am I good?  Can I go?  Can I go?  He's ignoring me.  He's just looking.  Can I go? ",

I'm not going to get arrested, but he's fishing for a statute that doesn't exist.  And on top of it, I don't even have my drone in the air.  It's not flying.  I'm using my controller to charge my phone because if you guys are just joining, I don't have my charger with me, but if you guys are just joining, the PD had... Had some issues with their code enforcement truck where Dina Joseph was just trashed.  It smoked in it, burned all the seats and all that.  So let me see if I can go.  Mayor, can I go?  Can I head out?  I just don't answer any other questions if you don't mind.  Do you have any crime I'm suspected of?  Because I need to get going.  I'm a little bit late.  Trying to verify the flight plan.  So is that, that's what I'm asking you.  If you're, if you're suspecting me of a crime still.  Are you still suspecting me of a crime?  I got to get going.  So you have state statutes or city ordinances against flying a drone?  I'm just asking you a question.  But are you a federal officer?  You can enforce federal law?  Tell me what federal law you enforce.  Tell me what federal law you enforce.  That's a state law.  That's why you can do.  it is because it's a state law.  Just because they carry over and they mirror each other doesn't mean that you can enforce federal law.  You have state laws like that.  So I don't know how long you've been on the force.  I'm not trying to discredit you, but I don't know how you can enforce federal law.  You can enforce a state statute that mirrors a federal law, but you don't have... But that's what I'm asking.  If you suspect me of a crime, I need to get going.  I don't think you have one.  You don't have one.  You're still fishing for one.  That's all I'm saying to you is that if I can't get going, I've got to get going.  So that's what I'm asking you.  Is there a crime that's suspected?  Because if you don't, I've got to get going, sir.  I don't have to answer your questions if that's the case.  But all I just want to do is get going if you don't have a crime.  If you don't have something in Florida statutes from the 39s all the way to the 1000s, just let me get going.  I can get going.  Your supervisor is going to take too long.  I don't want to wait for him.  You're advising me.  Thanks, sir.  Appreciate it.  There may be some other people coming down here flying, so just be aware if you want to research it.  That'd be the best thing to do.  I can't fly a drone for 30 minutes.  This thing's charging my phone.  That's all this is doing.  Silly. ",
