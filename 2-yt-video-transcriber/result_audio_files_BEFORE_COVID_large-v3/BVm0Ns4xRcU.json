            "text": "My dream is to help people understand how the universe operates so that each person can find their own unique purpose within the cosmic plan.  My name is Matias Estefano, and my purpose is to remember.  Since I was three, I began to remember past life before I was born.  I thought this was normal until many years later, I realized people could not see what I could see.  Usually, at this age, the brain begins to disengage with other dimensions, but mine stayed active and still is today.  This part of my brain that is still active allows me to remember in full detail the past and connects me with the cosmic memory that unites us all.  Through these visions, I see people and places and important things.  These visions help me piece together the existence of not only humans, but the universe itself.  This place I was connected to was referred to me in my visions as Thamthirga, which means spiral cord of God, or as I later learned, the central Akashic records.  I believe I have been given this gift to tap into the Akashic records of the cosmic plan so that I can help people understand the structure of the universe we live in, the concept of our existence, and the importance of things we ignore in everyday life that are essential for our growth as we move into the next dimension.  In this series, we will go beyond what you have read in history books, that civilization started 3,000 years ago, back to 30 million years ago, when humans first existed in the universe, and we will go back 6,000 million years ago to the creation of the universe itself.  We will cover races that influenced humanity since Lemuria and Atlantis.  We will cover alien groups in the universe, and the great war that took place in our galaxy.  I will share with you how to open your heart portal so that you can help others.  And last but not least, I will share how our world exists and why I was able to remember it.  12,000 years ago, I started on this journey, and this lifetime, I hope to fulfill it.  My dream is that you fulfill yours as well.  Once we have the tools to be bigger than society, bigger than our current bodies and larger than our understanding of who we think we are, we will be able to contribute our unique soul imprint into this time period of change.  My memories are bounded to my spiritual mind or higher self, who I call Gan, and by emotions through my soul and its memory of three specific lives.  One 12,000 years ago in the River Nile, another one 900 years ago in Scandinavia, and the farthest one almost 60 million Earth years ago in Gludok, a planet in Sirius.  Let's begin where there was no beginning.  It's important that every human being understand the dimensions, because we live in every dimension.  We are not just in one dimension.  We used to believe that we are in the third dimension, but actually, we live in every one of them.  Dimensions are not just a place that you go when your consciousness is aware of them.  It's a perspective you have of reality.  Reality is just one thing.  It's just only one dimension.  It's just one truth.  But that only truth has many ways of being seen.  So as many beings can see that only truth, we can have more perspective to improve that truth.  So that's why we have at least nine dimensions that are the basis of our reality.  And we are now able just to see the third dimension.  to fill the third dimension, but we actually live in many of them.  That's why when I try to explain where we come from or who am I or what is the truth of this reality, of this planet and the history of humanity, I will not explain the whole truth.  I will not explain the only truth.  I'm telling the part of the truth I've seen.  I started to remember every dimension when I was 15 years old in this life.  And it was, for me, the first time I changed the way I saw the universe.  because I realized that I was just a projection of the universe.  And my mind was trying to look for the place and the time where I could understand every dimension and from where I could explain every dimension.  And the first place where I found the best way to explain them was in one life, millions of years ago, In this planet, I remember with the name Gludok, in the constellation of Canis in the star of Sirius.  In that life, I was kind of a politician in charge of a neighborhood, but we were not like a society we have here on Earth.  We were, every one of us, like neurons, conscious neurons of the planet.  In our society, we knew that we were not alive because we were a civilization.  We realized that we were the thinking of the planet, that the only one evolving was the planet.  So every one of us had this knowledge that if we are the evolving consciousness of the planet, every one of us had to know the truth.  And if we share every part of the truth.  as a civilization, we can hold the knowledge of the self.  So that's why in that life, for me, was the first moment I could explain and I could feel and understand every reality and every dimension, because we were meant to know every dimension as our normal life.  For us in our civilization, in that planet, we used to see reality and our life like going through every dimension, in practicing every year of our entire life.  to understand that we were learning about ourselves in many perspectives and many dimensions.  So for us, it was normal to go through this knowledge, and it was not from the mind.  The only way you can go through every dimension is from the heart, because the heart is the only one that can feel before understanding.  Mind is just the process to understand the reality, and feelings are the way you can go through that reality.  That's why we were a very mental civilization, but when we had to understand everything, we just have to be silent and feel it.  The first thing I've learned on this planet about dimensions was that dimensions are just different perspectives of just one truth.  We were taught that the truth is like a sphere.  You cannot see the whole thing.  You just can't look into one part of it.  The perspective of that truth changed from where I'm seeing that truth.  So every one of us had to know many, at least 12 of those perspectives, so we could have the whole.  But we knew that we should not go and take every dimension for ourselves, and to go and look for every perspective for ourselves.  What we had to do was to center in our own reality and perspective, knowing that every one of them was true.  But if we go out of our perspective, then one of the parts would be missing.  At the beginning of the civilization, we were taught that our goal was to go to the stars.  what we as humanity are now.  We are looking to the heaven since thousands of years ago, and we are saying the stars are our goal, and we have to go there, and we have to look for life in other planets, and we have to go farther.  But suddenly, when we started to understand the dimensions, we understood that the only dimension that exists is the first one.  that the first one holds all the realities and every perspective, and the first one is just a spot in the core of the sphere.  So we realized that going out to look for that truth was not the goal.  The goal was to go in, in the core of the planet, and there we could see every perspective from one spot.  So our goal in reality was to leave every dimension, but not to go to those dimensions, but to understand that they all are just perspective of the first one, which is unity.  First dimension is mind.  First dimension is the thoughts.  There is nothing but consciousness in the universe.  That's the only thing that exists.  Mind is the only spot from where every perspective is projected in the universe.  There is nothing else but mind.  And the waves that the thinking, the thoughts, are doing in the universe creates these oceans of thinking that then we call time and space and every other dimension.  But unity was not created.  Unity is itself constant and the only thing that exists.  Everything is just a projection of the self, of just one being, and that one being You may call it God or whatever.  I call it the consciousness.  We are all in that consciousness and living the different perspective of that consciousness.  So unity is the only place from where we come from and where we go to.  That's why every being in the universe is telling us to go to unity.  to remember that we are one.  This is something that we as humanity are trying to understand now.  We are one, but we don't really know what exactly means to be one, because we think that being one is to be together and everyone think the same and everyone be happy and all in peace and harmony, and it's not that.  It's to remember that we are just holograms of the reality, which is one spot.  and that there is no other reality but one.  So the beginning of the first dimension is when the only consciousness existing in the universe made a question.  The question started from one certain thing, certain truth, that was, I am.  The only thing that the consciousness knew was that it was only one, and it was called I am.  So the universe was created from the self, from the one.  At the moment, the I am asks itself who I can become.  So there was the beginning of everything, but not the matter, not the galaxies, just the idea of being someone else.  This is a time where time doesn't exist.  There was no possibility to say it happened some years ago.  It's impossible to say so because there was no time, there was no space.  When you try to think about unity, the only way you can achieve that goal to feel it or to think about it is in your mind, in your imagination.  is the only way you can achieve unity.  There is no way you can do it through the third dimension.  The only way you can go through it is through mind.  That's why when we start to practice the unity, and we have to go to the very beginning, we have to go through every idea we have about reality.  because every reality is just a thinking, so it's not the real truth.  So there's no way to compare the beginning with anything you possibly know.  That's why every being on this planet and other planets that were told how to go to the unity, the first thing that they had to do was unlearn everything they've learned in their life. ",
