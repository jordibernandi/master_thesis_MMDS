            "text": "For most of my life I have suffered from chronic fatigue, sleepiness and a mild form of depression.  My lack of energy and lethargy was so bad that even normal day to day chores such as cleaning, vacuuming, washing dishes, working on my online business and mowing the lawn were a mission impossible for me.  I did not understand this back then and for some odd reason I thought that this was how most normal people also felt.  I wanted to improve my energy levels naturally.  and was eager to find something that really worked to boost my energy levels.  I was always against drugs and knew that pharmaceutical drugs were not the answer as they mask the symptoms but never address the root of the actual problem.  I wanted to research and find out more about different natural herbs and supplements that could help me to unlock the energy and focus that I've always wanted to have.  When researching into energizing natural health food and supplements, I came across coca tea for weight loss and energy.  Coca Tea does not have caffeine and has been used by the ancient people of Peru and Bolivia for well over 3,000 years.  The benefits of Coca Tea include Coca Tea boosts energy and clears the mind.  Coca Tea burns fat and stops hunger.  Coca Tea increases well-being and raises the mood.  Coca Tea cures headaches and migraines.  Coca Tea soothes an upset stomach and stops constipation.  And there are lots of other health-promoting benefits.  I am talking about the real organic Mata de coca.  Most people call it coca tea.  After further examination, I discovered that people in Peru and Bolivia have been brewing and chewing coca leaf tea for over 3000 years and still enjoy it on a daily occasions to this day.  The infamous drug cocaine is also made from this coca plant, but coca tea in its whole natural leaf form is actually healthy for human consumption.  whereas cocaine is dangerous and toxic for the heart.  In other words, consume coca tea for weight loss and energy, but refuse cocaine.  There are two strains of cultivated coca tea.  Erythrozylum coca var coca and the second Erythrozylum nova granatens.  Inside Erythrozylum coca var coca, the lowest and weakest alkali content belongs to Erythrozylum coca var aipado.  This coca plant grows in the Amazonian rainforest.  it has an average alkaloid content that's been rated at 0.25 percent.  Our unique triple strength coca tea flower comes from Erephrosylum novogranatans species that grows in Bolivia.  The average alkaloid content of this variety has been rated at a whopping 1.02 percent.  That represents almost four times the average content of a padau coca tea plant species.  hence why this coca flower demands a higher price and is rare to come across.  It tastes and smells differently to an average coca tea strain.  The end results are highlighted through significantly better energy levels, improved concentration and well-being.  Coca tea is a natural health-boosting energizer.  I was excited and eager to learn about coca tea and how it was healing for human health.  I had many questions about the healing powers of coca leaf tea.  What alcohols are there in the coca tea leaves?  Within the two strains cultivated in Peru and Bolivia, the lowest cocaine alcohol content has been rated at 0.25% while the highest is at 1.01%.  I also discovered a lab analysis which showed that coca tea has many beneficial alkaloids that work in synergy when drunk as tea or chewed with bicarb soda.  There was a total of 14 healthy alkaloids within coca tea that have been isolated to deliver health-promoting effects.  Coca tea has many nutritional benefits when taken as tea or chewed with bicarb soda.  Coca tea packs a variety of vitamins and minerals that people require for vibrant health.  Cocoa tea has been cultivated by indigenous people of South America for as long as 7,000 years.  Can cocoa tea delivery take place in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Europe and Australia?  Well, in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia, cocoa tea is consumed by adults and young children.  Many shops and street vendors sell coca tea flower, coca leaf tea bags and it's everywhere.  I thought I would try my luck placing an order online from a retail store.  I ordered 100 grams of coca tea flower from a Peruvian store.  I also was really happy when the coca tea package cleared the US customs and was delivered 6 weeks later.  I was really excited and went to make some coca tea.  I felt great energy buzz and a sense of well-being and alertness as I drank my first cup of coca de mate.  I also felt really good as I drank a second cup right after.  The following days, I was really starting to enjoy my coca tea for weight loss and energy.  I started to really feel energized and my well-being and overall drive as well as motivation was greatly improving.  I stopped procrastinating, stopped being lazy and no longer wanted to stay in bed in the morning.  I was eager to get up and make myself a cup or two of coca tea or simply chew coca.  My energy levels were steady and constant, and much higher than I have ever experienced before.  I got back to being physically active and I started going to the gym again.  I just wanted to do things again.  And even after the stimulating effects of coca tea wore off, which is about 60-80 minutes, there was no sudden crash.  I felt great and vibrant, but I also could go to sleep unlike with coffee.  My mind was also sharper when I was consuming coca tea.  I also started to chew coca tea with sodium bicarbonate as it gave me a bigger boost of energy and curbed my hunger pains.  My whole mouth becomes numb.  I can feel the rise of steady energy and that classic buzzed feeling that only coca tea flower can deliver.  After all, this is the way people in Peru and Bolivia prefer to consume their coca tea every day, by chewing it with sodium bicarbonate.  After consuming coca tea on and off for over three years, I now truly know that all that I read and researched about coca tea's health benefits were not fabricated.  They were the actual truth.  My life, well-being and health have vastly improved.  I have lots more daily energy.  I am motivated to succeed in everything that I do.  My mood and state of mind is positive and I stop writing myself off and stop sabotaging my own success.  And even though I can't completely owe it all to Coca Tea, deep down I know that it was Coca Tea that helped me push myself further to work harder, longer and have the clear, positive mindset to get me there and get things done.  Coca Tea has turned myself into an even better and more effective person.  more driven, more desiring, more energetic and much more successful.
