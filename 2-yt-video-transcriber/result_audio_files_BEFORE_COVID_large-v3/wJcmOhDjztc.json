And what's interesting about that is that he seemed to have a curious power over the two gentlemen who ran Bear Stearns, James Caine and Ace Greenberg.  And he was certainly questioned by the SEC back in the day\u2014 The Securities Exchange Commission.  Yes, as to what he might have known about an insider trading case to do with a company called St.  Joe's Mineral  Corp.,  in which both Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Caine were also questioned.  So, you know, this is a man who definitely trades in the knowledge he has over the rich and famous and uses it for leverage.  He also introduces rich and famous people like Bill Clinton, like Donald Trump, to girls.  You then asked me about the charges today.  I think what's so interesting about The charges today is that they're the result\u2014the indictments that are going to be unsealed are the result not only of the FBI's work, but of the Public Corruption Unit, which does suggest\u2014and obviously I'm speculating here\u2014that bribery may have been involved.  And why that's so important is, for me, who tried to expose this man for what he is back in 2000\u2014and I was actually reporting it late 2002, the peace ran in 2003\u2014is he has Ever since then, got away.  He's been untouchable.  His money has somehow bought him the ability to evade justice.  And so I'm fascinated by the fact that the Public Corruption Unit has been involved in this investigation, as well as the FBI.  It's one of the things that has haunted me.  is that there I was trying to expose this man in 2003.  And the original, the first FBI investigation, the one that got neutered by Alexandra Acosta, didn't begin until 2006.  So it's always been on my conscience that For three years, he molested hundreds of sort of helpless, poor women who were in no position to fight back against him. ",

You're not allowed to cut a deal like that and not tell victims who are cooperating with a separate FBI investigation, which is what happened.  They were completely blindsided by this thing. ",
