            "text": "Oh.  Mmm.  Tommy?  Is there any reason?  you feel like you have to come and give instructions?  I'm sorry?  Is there any reason why you have to come and give instructions?  I got a call for service, so I'm telling your guy to stay out of the street.  is what I'm doing.  Well, that's what you do?  You keep people out of the street?  Tell me what to do.  Well, I did.  Are we breaking the law?  Not right now, you're not.  Then you're dismissed.  I'm not going to go anywhere.  Neither are we.  Okay.  Let's sit here and film each other.  All right, let's see how long it takes for you to walk away.  Okay.  Don't stand behind me.  In my face, you don't stand behind me.  Don't touch me.  Don't stand behind me.  Don't touch me.  Don't stand behind me again.  Don't fucking touch me.  Don't fucking touch me.  You can yell and curse all you want.  You don't have the right to put hands on people, you fucking coward, man.  Back up.  Why don't you back up and stop being a bully?  I'm doing my job.  Why don't you back up and stop being the bully that you are?  If you stand behind me again, I will arrest you.  Yeah, you can't stop him from walking.  Do you understand what I'm telling you?  I'm going that way, dude.  Then walk that way.  Why are you such a coward, man?  You're the one with all the weapons.  How am I a coward?  You're the one recording with a gun and a taser and everything.  So what's your problem?  There's no problem.  You know why we're here.  You guys got us to come here.  Yeah, well, you come up all up in our face trying to antagonize us and intimidate us, but it's not going to work, man.  You can try all you want, dude, but that bully shit doesn't work anymore.  Okay.  You got to remember that.  Okay.  You use this as a training video to let your officers know that bullying the fucking public is not allowed, man.  We don't put up with that shit.  Anything else?  No, that's it, man.  You're dismissed.  I'm not going anywhere.  You're the one that chooses to stay here.  So you choose to be on the film.  You choose to participate.  We're getting filmed as well, sir.  You're choosing to be here.  Okay.  Stay away from my officers.  He's trying to... He's going to try to walk behind you.  What's your badge number, D. Gomez?  What's your badge number, D. Gomez?  What's your badge number, sir?  Look, man, I'm trying to be respectful to you, man.  What's your badge number?  My badge number?  Yeah.  It's right there on my badge.  Okay, well, just tell it to me because I'm not looking at your badge.  I'm looking at you.  Okay.  You need to stay out of the street.  I already told you once.  Oh, man.  Why, dude?  Why do you need to pick on people for?  I don't get it.  Why are you in threat?  Because he's walking in the street.  The streets are blocked off.  Actually, there's no cars passing through, so there's no safety issue, man.  What else do you want?  You came up on me, man.  I didn't ask you for anything.  Why don't you go away, man?  Why don't you go away?  Well, what do you want?  I don't understand why you're here.  For what?  What do I want?  I was actually filming them cleaning up the street right here.  What do you want?  What do you want?  What do you want?  What would you like to happen here?  What do you want, man?  What do you want?  I want you to get the fuck out of here, man.  Get out of my face.  I didn't ask for your service.  There's no reason for you to be talking to me.  I haven't broken the law.  You obviously know that.  You know that I have not broken the law, so there's no reason for you to be here, sir.  There's no reason for you to be here except for you causing a disturbance at this point and making people upset.  That's all you're good for.  Yeah, okay, you accept that?  No, you guys are wasting police services.  No, I'm not.  You're here.  You called for backup, right?  Anything else?  You called for backup, right?  You're the one that cowered up and called for backup.  You could have done this by yourself, man.  But no, you're fearing for somebody walking in the street.  That's what you do.  You fear for somebody's life, for somebody walking in the street.  Stay off the street.  Stay off the street.  Yeah, just wait till your kids get treated like this, man, by a police officer that doesn't know who you are.  Get your kids and throws them in the back of a little jail box in the back of your car.  See how you like it, man.  All right, anything else, gentlemen?  No, we didn't ask you for anything in the first place, so fuck off, man.  Kick rocks.  Kick rocks, man.  Start walking.  Hey, what the fuck you doing?  What's this guy doing?  Yeah, they want to stop us.  They want to antagonize and interrogate us.  Yeah.  Later.  Kick rocks, man, like I said.  Like I said you would.  There's a lot of them for you to kick on the way out.  Sorry for the shaky video, guys.  I don't have my rig today.  So I'm trying to hold my shaky camera in my hand.  And there he goes.  G. Gomez, guys.  He never gave me his badge number.  It's always on Wilson and Walnut.  Ask him for his badge on the Pacific Institute.  Later.  Later.  Later.  Alright, so that officer definitely grabbed with your watch by the arm and try to push him back to the side.  For no reason, there was no reason for him to be near us.  Anyways, he approached us.  We're trying to do is.  It's just stand here and film.  We're not bothering anybody.  We haven't talked to anyone.  These cowards.  These guys call the cops on us for no reason.  These people right here.  I'm going to put the address too.  Where's the address at?  You guys are on the internet for calling the cops on the people in the public.  These guys called the cops on us.  This little crybaby right here.  This guy right here.  That one.  He called the cops on us.  He doesn't like people filming in public.  Fucking crybaby.  Well, crybabies.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable, sir.  Can't believe you're such a scary guy.  You call the police or somebody filming out in public.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Your people should be ashamed of you for being a coward.  It's great.  Yeah.  Powered. ",
