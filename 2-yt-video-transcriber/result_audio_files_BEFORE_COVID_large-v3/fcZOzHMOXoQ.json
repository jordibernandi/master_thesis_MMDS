Life started out with very simple forms and then gradually, over hundreds of millions of years, morphed into all the forms we see today.  Bacteria to Beethoven.  Not a straight line, of course, but that's roughly how it went.  This was the theory proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859, and with some modification, it's been embraced as unassailable by the scientific community over the last century.  As evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins says, if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is either ignorant, stupid, or insane.  But is that right?  Are there no scientific reasons to doubt the evolutionary account of life's origins? ",

There are a few proposed explanations for the Cambrian explosion, all of which are more plausible and satisfactory than intelligent design.  One is that the Cambrian is when organisms were unusually likely to fossilize.  Far fewer animals had bones or shells back then, so it was extra rare for their body parts to fossilize.  More organisms started to develop shell-like structures, and geological conditions at the time were such that there were more sediments capable of preserving even soft-bodied fossils.  The explosion may not have been an explosion of the number or diversity of organisms on the planet, but merely an explosion of fossils.  Also, it's not as though there are no fossils at all which predate the Cambrian. ",

But this raises questions about the creative power of natural selection and mutation.  Natural selection is a simple sorting process.  Species keep favorable mutations that allow them to survive, but eliminate bad mutations that cause their members to die out.  No one doubts that natural selection is a real process, and that it produces minor variations.  But many biologists now doubt that it produces major innovations in biological form. ",

In all codes and languages, there are vastly more ways of arranging characters that will generate gibberish than there are arrangements that will generate meaningful sequences.  And this applies to DNA.  Remember, natural selection only selects sequences that random mutations generate.  Yet experiments have established that DNA sequences capable of making stable proteins are extremely rare, and thus really hard to stumble on randomly.  How rare?  While working at Cambridge University, molecular biologist Douglas Axe showed that for every DNA sequence that generates a relatively short functional protein, there are 10 to the 77th power non-functional sequences.  Now consider that there are only 10 to the 65th power atoms in our galaxy.  So finding a new DNA sequence capable of building a functional protein is like searching blindfolded for a single marked atom among a trillion Milky Way galaxies.  Talk about a needle in a haystack.

He says, In altering the enzyme in this way, he modeled a variant that would be exquisitely sensitive to mutation.  And on this basis alone, we may conclude that the claims of ID proponents vis-a-vis Axe 2004 are exaggerated and wrong.  Axe responded that using the variant of the enzyme that's actually found in an organism would produce even lower probabilities.
