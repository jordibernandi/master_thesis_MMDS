            "text": "Hey guys, so in case you didn't know, the new thing in social media now is to say you've been banned from China.  This is an amazing way to get attention.  It makes you seem righteous.  It's total virtual signaling and virtue signaling is like the best thing to do these days, right?  To say you stand for something, to say that you're such a good person and you fought for freedom.  So that's a new thing.  So Zed, now PewDiePie?  PewDiePie?  So I don't want to say his name.  They're all claiming that China banned them.  And they actually made it seem really real.  And all these news articles, of course, the Western media, they just believed it.  Because anything that's negative about China, they will just report without any question.  Why would these people go ahead and lie and say they've been banned by China?  Number one, again, to get attention.  Number two, to make it seem like they're good.  And number three, it's easy to do.  There's absolutely no one in the mainstream media, or we could say Western media, that would ever defend China.  So even if someone's lying, spreading rumors about China, even really dangerous rumors, there's not one person that would ever defend China.  And that's because the mainstream media is owned by the 1%, the richest people in our countries.  And they hate China.  These rich people don't want Chinese companies to win.  They don't want Chinese companies to beat Western companies in any industry.  AI, electric vehicles, quantum computing.  We all know there's a cold war going on between the West and China right now.  And so as long as you can throw mud and smear China... you're good to go.  Even if your lie is insane and you're saying China's developed robot dinosaurs that shoot lasers out of their assholes, it doesn't matter.  The mainstream media will absolutely project your story and whatever your lie, whatever smear you have, they will promote you.  And of course, it also continues the narrative, the Western narrative that China is this evil country that's like torturing Uighurs and all that stuff.  And none of these things have been proven.  They're all accusations.  But the Western media just continues to smear because they are terrified of this developing country.  China's still developing.  It's definitely not a fully developed country.  They're so terrified that they're going to surpass America's position as the number one economy in the world.  So anyways, here I am exposing the lies because that's what we need to do on YouTube.  And here is PewDiePie's lie.  Check out this little clip.  He's like, oh, I got banned by China and he just shows this little clip of this random browser that I've never seen in my life.  I've been living in China for four years and what is this shit?  Take a look.  Well, boys, we did it.  I'm banned from China.  That's right.  After I spoke about the Hong Kong protest, I'm banned from China.  And now let's get to it, okay?  So let's just get on the internet and I'm going to show you in 10 seconds that he's not banned in China.  So right now I'm on my page because I like looking at my page.  And the VPN's turned on, so I'm going to have no problems getting on YouTube.  So in case you didn't know, in China, yes, they do block a lot of Western sites like Google and Facebook, but you get a VPN, it's no problem.  And the government basically allows it like jaywalking.  So jaywalking is illegal in most countries, so let me turn that off.  Jaywalking is of course illegal in almost any Western country, but if you do it, no one's going to arrest you or give you a ticket, right?  So the same thing with VPNs.  I have never heard of anyone getting in trouble for using a VPN because the internet's blocked basically just to block out Western brainwashing, which... is happening everywhere, right?  I mean, everyone believes, not everyone, but many people believe the Western media, and they're always lying, like I'm showing you right now.  I'm going to turn off my VPN, and see this little icon right here?  That is it right there, so I'm just going to quit it.  And now I'm not going to be able to access YouTube anymore.  Look at the red bar.  The red bar going past, it's going to stop there.  That's what happens when you're in China trying to access these sites.  The government just feels like they're spreading stupid information.  which they are in a lot of cases, they are, yeah.  I mean, in China, you're never gonna have anti-vax people, okay?  Because China's not gonna go for that.  They're not gonna tolerate people spreading dangerous lies that could really affect people and make people sick and die.  So here you can see Google doesn't work.  So the VPN is gone, okay?  And now I'm gonna go into Bing.  Because Bing is not blocked, Bing is the Microsoft search.  And we're going to go to PewDiePie.  Boom.  There he is, his face, his information.  And totally not blocked.  So he was just completely, completely lying.  Here is a site here that you can open, I think.  And there you go.  There you go.  There you go.  What the heck?  And just again, there you go.  No VPN here.  Bunch of stuff.  No problems.  That's how it is, guys.  People just lie straight to your face.  In the Western medias, even including YouTube.  I'm not saying Chinese people, of course there's a lot of liars in China too, but like, I'm just not sure if all of us know that there's just so much lying going on here.  Yeah, so Wikifame.  Whatever that is, I've never heard of it, but yeah.  Okay, there, beautiful picture of PewDiePie right there.  And the funny thing is, even if I go to Baidu, I can find PewDiePie 2.  This is the totally Chinese search engine.  And the thing is, Chinese people don't even know who PewDiePie is, and I actually went downtown Guangzhou and interviewed a bunch of people, and you can see that nobody knows who he is.  You can check it out right now.  This is the picture I'm showing right now, and I got his name highlighted and his face.  He's very famous in America.  Do you know this guy?  PewDiePew.  No.  He's very famous in America.  He's very famous in America.  Yes.  You haven't seen him?  No.  Do you know this guy?  PewDiePew.  You don't know him?  I don't know him.  He's very famous in America.  He's a bit familiar.  PewDiePew.  He's a bit familiar.  A little bit.  Yes, a little bit familiar.  Do you know his name?  I don't know.  Do you know this guy?  PewDiePew.  He's very famous.  You don't know him?  PewDiePew.  No.  You haven't been there?  No, I haven't.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  It's this person.  PewDiePew.  He's a very famous internet celebrity in Korea.  PewDiePew.  No.  Okay.  I don't know him.  He's a very famous internet celebrity in America.  I don't know him.  I don't know him.  He's a very famous internet celebrity in America.  PewDiePew.  No, I haven't seen him.  No, I haven't seen him.  Okay.  No one knows.  Nobody.  Do you know this guy, PewDiePew?  I've heard about him.  PewDiePew, yeah.  What do you know about him?  He's a famous YouTuber.  But I didn't watch his videos.  But I've seen a lot of YouTubers watch his videos.  He's very famous.  PewDiePie.  I've never seen him.  Really?  Okay.  I don't know him.  Really.  He's a very famous PewDiePie internet celebrity in the US.  I don't know him.  I don't know him.  Okay.  Do you know this person?  So even in Baidu, which is totally Chinese, you can find PewDiePie.  There.  Right there.  The first search.  And again, just to show you, my VPN is not on.  And just to prove it right now, I will go and try to go to Google.  And nothing's gonna happen.  It's just gonna try to load and it's gonna eventually die.  I'll let it die and I'll have a sip of my beer.  Uh, it's so slow.  Okay, see?  So my VPN is not on.  Alright?  So all you doubters out there, boom.  No problems.  So I turned my VPN back on.  You can see the little arrow here.  And I just want to show you a weird thing because not only did PewDiePie lie, but all the Western media lied as well.  They just jumped on his lie and report it as fact.  And that's what has been going on for years with China.  One person says a lie and all the media just... piggyback on it and ride it, they ride that lie along and pretend it's fact.  And that's why so many people have this totally skewed image of China.  because the media is lying straight to our face and then building on other sources' lies, other media's lies.  So we're just swimming in this tsunami, I like to call it, an ocean, a tsunami of lies, lies built on lies.  Watch, I'll just search PewDiePew right now.  I gotta move this.  My camera's right there.  PewDiePew banned in China.  And we're gonna get tons of articles and it's ridiculous because I just showed you that he's not banned at all.  And they're all gonna say he's banned.  It's hilarious.  There's one article I read the other day that was just so stupid.  It said like, if you search his name, you can't find anything.  I think it was like the Hollywood Insider or something like that.  Okay, we'll go to this one, Business Insider.  So Business Insider seems like a pretty legit media source, right?  It sounds legit, Business Insider, but totally lying.  Look at this Photoshop picture right here.  This picture is totally fake.  So they totally made up this whole thing.  This is not a real thing.  That's not a real mask.  Nobody was wearing many of the Pooh signs.  They made up this whole thing.  And it's so funny.  Like, they literally just fabricated a story.  Okay, PewDiePie said in a video Friday that he has been banned from China.  over video he published, blah blah blah.  I got banned from China, that's right, he said in his video.  Alright, so that's what he says, but who knows?  There's literally no proof.  Anyways... Okay.  Okay, so at least the article's trying to be a little bit fair here.  They're not totally agreeing with this.  They're not trying to jump on the wagon.  But at the same time, the title says he was banned from China, right?  So the title makes it seem like he was banned, but I think the person writing it has a little bit of a... What's the word?  He has a little bit of professionalism, so he's not going to say, yes, he was banned.  But the way it's written, the title, is basically like he got banned from China, right?  says he was banned but there's nothing like challenging it.  so if you for most people they just read the title and that's it right and then they'll think okay he got banned from china because china just bans anyone.  okay.  so here right here it says it's not exactly clear what the ban on pewdiepie exactly means because he isn't there.  YouTube, where PewDiePie content lives, has been blocked in China since 2009.  Nevertheless, PewDiePie still maintains a Chinese fanbase.  Not really, nobody knows him, and I already showed you in the video.  At the very end of this article, there's someone who's saying he's not banned.  So at the very end.  So this is how propaganda spreads.  Even though this journalist is trying to be responsible, he still promoted the fact that he got banned.  Because it doesn't say... You know, this title, YouTuber PewDiePie says he's been banned in China.  But it doesn't say something like... Xu Daipai claims he's been banned in China.  You know, it makes it seem like he was really banned, even though this article clearly shows it's not certain, and it doesn't look like he has been banned.  So let's look at this one, Distractify.  I mean, this doesn't look like legit media content, but anyways.  PewDiePew was banned in China.  So this idiot, Shannon Raphael, thank you very much for just saying he was banned when there's zero proof.  While Swedish YouTuber PewDiePew is no stranger to controversy or causing headlines, he's in some hot water in one country over his latest video.  PewDiePew is widely considered one of the most successful solo YouTubers in the world, blah blah blah.  But his view count might be about to take a huge hit.  Not really, because there's not that many Chinese people watching YouTube, because it is blocked.  All right.  Because after he's allegedly been banned in the most public... Allegedly.  I love how you use the word allegedly because you know it's a lie.  So why was PewDiePie banned?  So you've already assumed that it's true.  Oh, these vlogs are terrible.  He was not banned.  Why are you saying he was?  This is so stupid.  Oh, these blogs.  I mean, this is what's wrong with the world.  This is why so many people are stupid.  Because people just spread information with zero questioning, zero critical thinking skills.  No one knows the truth anymore.  That's so stupid.  Anyway, I read an awesome article the other day that said, I think they already took it off the internet because it was so dumb, but I think it was like from the Hollywood Explorer or something like that.  And it said PewDiePie has been scrubbed from the internet, absolutely scrubbed from the Chinese internet.  And I just showed you he has not been because nobody knows him.  He literally has no significance in China.  There's no reason to ban him.  If they banned him, no one would know or care.  But anyways, you don't ban people that don't matter, okay?  Anyways, this is another typical attack on Asians, on Chinese, on China.  It's easy to attack a country where no one will defend it.  No one has the guts to defend China.  No one has the reason to defend it because they all believe the Western lies.  Another perfect example.  All right, I think I'm done with this. ",
