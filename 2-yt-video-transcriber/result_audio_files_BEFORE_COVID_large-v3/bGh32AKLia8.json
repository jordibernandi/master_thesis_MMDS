Okay, here's where the government lays it on thick, kids.  Residents may hear sounds associated with training, including aircraft and weapons simulations.  Citizens in close proximity to the areas the training will take place will be notified prior to the training.  Ask any of these people that were being interviewed on the streets and none of them were given a heads up as to what was going on.  Everybody was in shock.  I definitely think, you know, it would be nice to get a heads up.  You know, nowadays you just never know what's happening.  In just a few seconds, I'm going to show you a video of two consecutive door breaches.  These are charges to force open a locked or reinforced door.  Okay, this is 1138 Wilshire Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles.  This is the Guatemalan House of Culture.  And here's a wide shot of it from Google Street View.  Here's a tighter shot of the doors, the metal doors.  And you can see that there are signs that say that it's closed.  It's an abandoned building and it was slated for demolition in a month from now.  So let's listen to the breach charge as they blow up this metal gate front door.  So the big building in the back there is the Wells Fargo Bank, which is pictured here on the right.  The Guatemalan House of Culture is just to the left out of frame here.  And here's a Black Hawk helicopter, apparently having just dropped off troops on the ground.  And here comes the first of two door breaches.  That was the front door to 1138 Wilshire Boulevard.  Anyone who thinks this is a military exercise is poorly informed.  They are raiding an actual real world address.  and here comes the second breach.  Which apparently was the back door to get in.  So... Keep thinking that it's a military exercise, kids. ",

            "text": "So wait, I'm confused.  The military says that they gave ample notice to local residents, yet the local residents are saying they had no notice.  Which is it?  Also, since when, after starting two foreign wars, do US service members need to invade our own cities in order to do any sort of urban warfare training?  For example, here's what the military calls the box.  It's located at Fort Irwin, which is in the California desert.  It's a full-scale mock-up of what can be expected overseas.  In this training video, they're actually using simulated weapons fire and simulated IEDs.  If you notice, when the simulated IED explodes, there is no residual damage to any property.  Unlike in downtown Los Angeles, where the buildings have had all the glass blown out of the ground floor windows.  Who on God's earth would believe that the US military would come land on Wilshire Boulevard, downtown Los Angeles to conduct a training exercise with no notice, blow up an actual building and leave with several packages?  This was an op, people.  There was an HVT or high-value target inside the 1138 Wilshire Boulevard address, which I believe and several others believe was a bioweapon, judging by the white suits that the operators are wearing.  I'll show you a video of its extraction next.  Okay, here's the Wells Fargo Bank building once again in the foreground.  And here come four Little Bird helicopters, completely blacked out, Here is a stock photo of that helicopter to give you some reference as to their size and where the operators fit inside the helo.  They're going to land right in front of the 1138 Wilshire Boulevard address.  And you can see four operators go to each helo.  They're all wearing white hazmat suits.  Now, these are night stalkers.  These are the Army's 160th SOAR, or Special Operations Aviation Regiment, based out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  These are the elite of the elite.  Now, when the little birds take off, keep your eyes on the men dangling out of the little birds.  They're clearly visible with their feet on the skids.  Then they magically disappear.  Did you miss it?  Let me show it to you again.  Alright, I'm going to show it to you three times in real time.  Notice how the operators are outside the military choppers on the skids in the white suits and they magically disappear after they cross behind the palm trees.  Isn't that interesting?  Almost as if they're using some sort of cloaking device.  Here it is in slow motion.  In case you think your eyes are playing tricks on you.  Now you see them.  And now you don't.  You can see the first little bird in the front.  There's the second little bird.  Here comes the third little bird.  This isn't some Universal Studios stunt show, kids.  This is real world ops.  And I don't know why they would expose top secret cloaking technology to all of downtown Los Angeles unless it was mission critical.  Here comes the Blackhawk.  Oh, fuck.  He's like invincible.  So here is where the first of two Black Hawk helicopters, again, with all the lights out, lands on Wilshire Boulevard.  You can see the refueling probe in the front of the helicopter.  And here come the operators and look, they've got carrying almost like a stretcher sideways.  They've got two HVTs and they're getting on board this Blackhawk helicopter.  Blackhawk helicopter will hold 11 men and they just put two packages, HVT packages in.  Here comes the second helo.  Okay, here it is.  I looped it for you guys a couple of times in real time, zoomed in, and then one time in slow-mo.  There's 10 operators.  that get on board in white hazmat suits.  You can clearly see two high value Targa II packages that they are carrying.  Two men each are carrying it.  And they get on board this Helo.  And if you notice you can see all of the guys in their white suits and then once it takes off they all disappear as well.  Here you can see a second Black Hawk helicopter coming in the land.  This helo is going to take off.  And all of the guys will disappear.  And they're gone.  But you can see their feet hanging out the side of the helicopter.  Right there.  You can see all of their feet hanging out.  Second helicopter is going to come in.  This one actually has its lights on.  Not sure why.  Okay, quick aside, this is the vantage point of the photographer.  In the bottom of the frame, circled in red, is the Guatemalan House of Culture, boarded up.  I shot this photo several days after the incident took place.  The yellow circle of the palm trees, which obscured part of the video when the helicopters landed on Wilshire Boulevard, up in the blue areas where the photographer, citizen journalist was during the night of the incident.  This is just to give you a bit of perspective of his vantage point.  This is a classic example of a citizen journalist who made headlines with his footage.  We're often approached by law enforcement with them saying, if you are press, where's your press pass?  Press is something that you engage in.  It is not something that you are.  Oh, yeah.  Without missing a beat right when that thing hits the ground.  Here come the operators and look there's another two guys carrying another package.  So it looks like they took three high value targets out of this address.  which then one can only speculate.  what was going to happen with these bio or chemical weapons?  Were they going to be dispersed once the building was demolished in a month from now?  And who owns the Guatemalan House of Culture?  More on that later.  Again, all of the operators magically disappear And you can still see their feet hanging out the side.  So just in case you weren't sure if this was a bioweapon or not, here is one of the Black Hawk helicopters getting sprayed down on a surface street with some what appears to be some sort of chemical decontamination.  I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments section as to what you think is going on in any parts of this video, especially this portion.  Why on earth would this be part of a training exercise in the middle of downtown Los Angeles?  Looks pretty real to me.  So if you're anything like me, you're asking yourself, where were all the news choppers in Los Angeles?  LA is the media capital of the world.  The answer is Long Beach.  All of the mainstream media was sent there by the Army to film the distraction, while the real operation was taking place downtown on Wilshire Boulevard.  The Wilshire Boulevard infiltration and exfil were never supposed to see the light of day.  Thank God in this day and age we have people who create their own stories outside of the mainstream media.  Long Beach was simply theater. ",

It's got a long antenna extending from the rear of the jet which seeks out magnetic anomalies in the ocean used in the hunting of enemy submarines.  Apparently it's also got signals intercept capabilities and or ground penetrating radar and was circling over the Los Angeles area at 20,000 feet on February the 4th, one week prior to the raid.  Again, if you think this was all an exercise, I've got a bridge to sell you.  In addition to the 1138 address, the 1150 Wilshire address was also breached during this raid.  You can see plywood covering up one of the entry points to the building within the red circle.  Also, this wide shot shows the Girardi law firm circled in blue, which will be featured in part two of this story.  Stay tuned for me getting a hero's welcome at the Girardi law firm next door to 1138 Wilshire.  I wonder if it's all connected.  Says who?  Just a warning.  Call the cops.
