            "text": "Okay, so you may have noticed, if you're a Twitter person, that I was trending on Twitter today because it was a day ending in Y. My apparently very controversial comments were these.  Apparently, I made three controversial comments yesterday.  And I know that I made these because not only did I say them, I also went back and watched the tape of me saying them and then also read the transcript of me saying them.  So here are the three points that I made yesterday.  One, I'm very happy that the U.S.  women's national soccer team won the World Cup.  Also, I don't really enjoy women's soccer because it is played as a lesser skill level than men's soccer and very often at the same level as teenage boys.  Okay, that's point number one.  Point number two was that the women's world soccer team does not deserve to be paid the same as the men's world soccer team based on the amount of income they bring in.  And I went through a lot of statistics.  The fact that FIFA made $6 billion from the 2018 Men's World Cup and the women's 2019 World Cup made $130 million.  I pointed out the discrepancy there.  I talked about the differences between contracts.  So that was point number two.  Point number three was about Megan Rapinoe, who's this big star.  She's a media star now.  She was on MSNBC with Rachel Maddow.  She was on CNN with Anderson Cooper.  And I made the point that she is highly popular and being treated as a political figure because she is both excellent at soccer, a very, very good soccer player, and also because she's a very outspoken LGBT advocate.  She's a very outspoken lesbian advocate.  And she yells at President Trump a lot.  And she talks about how America sucks and yells for the anthem.  And the point that I was making there was that she is complaining a lot about a country that is making her extraordinarily wealthy, that treats gay people overall incredibly well.  And she is evidence that the country actually treats gay people extraordinarily well.  She makes millions of dollars while kneeling for the national anthem.  and being a very outspoken lesbian.  She's not a victim, in other words.  Well, this apparently made one particular guest, Lauren Zuka, very angry.  She tweeted out this.  She tweeted out, LOL, F off, Ben Shapiro.  If Megan Rapinoe is getting contracts for any reason other than her talents, it's because she just provided an entire generation of baby dykes with their awakening moment.  Well, here to discuss it is Lauren Zuka.  Lauren, I really appreciate your time.  Thanks for coming on the show. ",

This is something we don't really see.  And it brought me to tears multiple times.  And I'm so excited about it.  And I. I think I have some criticisms of rainbow capitalism, but I love to see this level of acceptance around the LGBTQ community.  And I am really excited about the fact that corporations think that an LGBTQ identity that is as visible as Meghan's is valuable.  So that's what I was saying.

So now it's my turn for like 30 seconds.  I promise there's plenty of time.  So what I actually said was that what was making me upset was that Megan Rapinoe's claim to fame right now is not merely her sexuality, her sexual orientation, which we've seen before, by the way, Abby Wambach famously kissed her partner in 2016 after winning the World Cup.

At the same time, it seems as if these corporations see the LGBTQ identity that Megan Rapinoe so proudly displays as valuable.  And those are two different things.  Because I noticed in your clip, and I definitely did watch the whole thing multiple times.  I didn't transcribe it, so you're ahead of me on that, but I did watch it. ",

I mean, this has been fact checked by everybody from The Washington Post to Snopes.  There is not solid evidence that the women are being discriminated against in pay.  If you want women's equity on the Women's World Cup stage, you're going to have to explain that.  how it is that the men's World Cup earned $6 billion in 2018 and the women's World Cup earned $130 million in 2018 and in 2019.  And the women and men are supposed to have the same prize money.  If the men earned $400 million, men just generally, all the men's teams earned $400 million in prize money in 2018.
