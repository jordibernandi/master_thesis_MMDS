So when people say that Judaism predicts the coming of Christ, the change in the nature of what Christ is, what a Messiah would be, is different from Judaism to Christianity.  So Judaism never posited that there would be.  God come to earth in physical form, and then you know, acting out in the world in that way.  Judaism posits that God is beyond space and time.  Occasionally he intervenes in history, but he doesn't take physical form.  It's one of the key beliefs of Judaism, actually, is an incorporeal God.  So that means that it's a, the idea is actually foreign to Judaism of a merged God-man who then is, who is God in physical form, but then dies and is resurrected and all this. ",

Messiah simply means anointed one, and in the book of Samuel the term applies to the kings of Israel.  There's no mention of execution or resurrection or being a living God.  Those things have nothing to do with the Old Testament concept of the Messiah.  As Bart Ehrman says, Many Christians today assume that the earliest followers of Jesus concluded that he was the Messiah because of his death and resurrection.  If Jesus died for our sins and was raised from the dead, he must be the Messiah.  But such thinking is precisely wrong.  Ancient Jews had no expectation, zero expectation, that the future Messiah would die and rise from the dead.  That was not what the Messiah was supposed to do.  Whatever specific idea any Jew had about the Messiah as cosmic judge, mighty priest, powerful warrior, What they all thought was that he would be a figure of grandeur and power who would be a mighty ruler of Israel.  And Jesus was certainly not that.  Jesus, in short, was the opposite of what Jews expected a Messiah to be.  And you don't have to take the word of an agnostic like Ehrman.  Apologists frequently make this point.  William Lane Craig even argues that the inconsistency between the expectation that Jews had about the Messiah and what Jesus actually did is proof that Jesus' story was not made up. ",
