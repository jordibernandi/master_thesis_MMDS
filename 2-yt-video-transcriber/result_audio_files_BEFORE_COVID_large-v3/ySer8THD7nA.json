            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to Moon Ride, where we're channeling the man in the moon.  I'm going to look at the impeachment process.  That's the part that the Senate is just about to take up the actual, I guess you would say trial.  I'm just very curious to see how it will go.  So Spirit, what can you tell me about the trial?  Hmm.  Well, one thing that you might notice, people keep saying, oh, it doesn't matter.  They're just going to convict.  Well, it doesn't matter.  Look, it really does matter.  This is something that has put McConnell in a difficult bind.  He is going to have to manage this.  You know, the Republicans for Trump are always good at saying no, no, no, no, no, in a sense that, oh, we can't do anything.  I can't stop that.  This is one of the things where they're going to have to say yes to something.  They can't just criticize the the plan.  They have to execute the plan.  And that means that they are open to criticism because nobody's going to be happy no matter how they work it.  They're taking it up in the Senate.  It is a political, it just, it's a political quagmire for the Republicans.  So do not let the trolls convince you that this just doesn't matter.  Even if it's just a historical moment, it matters.  People will be looking at this in history and everybody knows it.  So that's why people try to distract you from it.  It is important.  So McConnell's there.  He's having a lot of difficulty.  He keeps putting his hand on his forehead like, oh my God, it's going to be a mess.  And I mean that for Republicans.  It is going to be a mess.  It's going to go around and they're going to have to change it.  And then something else is going to happen and they're going to have to change it.  And they're going to look really foolish.  They're going to try to change the rules or the methods.  Nothing is going to work.  It's just going to circle back around.  And the whole time they're circling around, more information is going to be coming through to damage Trump.  So is Trump going to appear before Congress?  McConnell's shaking his head like, no, no, no, no, don't do that.  But I don't know if Trump will do it anyway.  Understand that this is part of the problem.  Trump's going to do whatever he's going to do, no matter what McConnell says.  So they really have no control over him?  And that's not good for McConnell.  He doesn't like things he can't control.  Notice that McConnell is all about this kind of control.  You don't see him making these broad statements, whatever.  He's just in the background.  So now he's going to be forced into the limelight and to justify his decision.  But what about Trump?  Is he really going to speak?  I kind of get that.  he's going to come close to speaking, but not.  Like he's just like walking up to the steps of the Senate and then they say, no, I think he's even going to really think that he's going to do that, but they're going to say, no way we, you know, you think you're smart, but nobody else does Donald.  Uh, so shut up, but that's going to be in itself.  It's going to be a problem.  Why are you now divide denying the president the right to speak?  You know, it's, it's just, it's all a mess for Republicans.  There is no good answer for Republicans.  And Trump is going to make it worse.  He's just going to rage and rage and rage.  And now instead of raging at Democrats, he'll be raging at Republicans, dividing the party.  Now realize how motivated Trump is.  Trump is trying to keep out of jail.  He is asking them to do some kind of miracles, that they're going to change the numbers for how many people are going to vote for him.  So he's asking McConnell to do something that McConnell is not at all capable of doing.  He doesn't have the glamor that is attached to people like Trump.  Not that I think he's glamorous.  It's just that he doesn't have that ability to mystify.  And nobody's going to sit up and watch McConnell talk, for goodness sakes.  So it's a real clash.  And it's showing a clash within the party.  And it's further dividing the party.  It is further rendering everything they say meaningless, right?  Like you have these core values.  Well, all of them have been overturned by Trump.  It's just power.  So what do you stand for?  Well, if it's only power, when that power's gone, you stand for nothing.  See McConnell writing something.  He's interrupted by Trump.  He has to write it again.  He's interrupted by Trump yesterday and again.  Think how many times McConnell's going to put himself out there and Trump is going to mow right over him.  Because what does Trump care about McConnell?  And it is making McConnell angry.  And his wife is telling McConnell, like, look, this guy's really crazy.  He really is nuts.  She works with him in the Oval Office and she's seen what he's done.  She's like, he really is a nut job.  Like, you can't predict him.  Like, she's worried.  She's actually even maybe as worried as McConnell.  She's like, look, you know, you don't know where this is going to go, man.  She is badgering him on a daily basis behind her fake smile.  And that is McConnell's wife is badgering McConnell.  It's funny because you know how old guys sometimes get together in the steam room and have these conversations.  There he is in the steam room with McConnell and Trump and Johnson and a couple other guys that are all in the Senate and they're all kind of sitting around making their secret agreements.  But I keep getting this feeling like McConnell's had it.  He's just like, I've had it.  I've had enough.  I can't deal with Trump anymore.  I'm done.  And this might even just be on a personal perspective.  Like, I can't go and lie for this guy anymore.  I can't do it.  And he's also like, what am I getting out of this?  You know, I get to manage Trump.  That's my reward.  Fantastic.  You know, nobody likes me.  You know, I might lose in my next election.  What am I getting out of this relationship with Donald?  I get three weeks for a trial.  I get a lot of problems for Republicans, just practical everyday, like, like the kind of embarrassing moments that just, that just make you squirm.  That's the kind of thing that's just not predicted.  So can we know anything more about the trial?  I'm seeing that there are witnesses.  It looks like they just want to put in a few, but they're, you know, significant witnesses like the ambassador, Yakonovich?  I'm not sure how to say her name.  But she seems to be there, and she's been talking a lot.  Maybe... There seem to be some other witnesses.  They seem to be the ones that Trump people find easy to antagonize.  So, you know, for example, the... Vindman was hard because he's got all the braids and things.  He looks like a military guy.  There are... The lady who was working, I forget what her name is with the brown hair.  I really should know her name, but when I'm doing this work, I lose track of some nouns.  She is not there.  So they don't want people who are looking good.  I think they have to put in Yakunovich.  Again, the ambassador's name, I'm not saying right.  She seems to be speaking... And she's being very frank, and she's making them furious.  You know, the real right-wingers, the Jim Jordans, the go-gerards, goreks, whatever.  These guys are pissed.  And they're attacking her.  They do not look good attacking her.  As a matter of fact, some people find the attack on her shocking.  Especially women.  And women don't like it.  They don't like seeing her attacked that way.  And I know, you know, there's some Republican women, women in the center, they haven't made their choices yet.  It is not going to help the Republicans.  But they couldn't sweep it under the rug.  They couldn't just sweep it under the rug.  They have to do something.  You know, they have to at least pretend to have a real trial.  So they're going to try to just limit it to these few people.  And I get Lev Parnas is going to do something during the trial.  I think one of those guys, Lev Parnas or Igor, one of them, I don't know which one's which, but I mean, I get the name and then I get Lev Parnas and I get that he will speak in front of them, that he is being interviewed, may not even be live.  but it might be live.  At the very least, he seems to get on television and really upset the process by which they're going through.  He has revelatory information.  I even feel like Giuliani might make a last ditch.  I don't know if they'll take him.  Cause he's going to look really bad, but, um, he will try to be interviewed by them.  So look, I'm getting the message that, you know, and this, this is really difficult to watch, um, because watching somebody gaslight you constantly and tell, you know, you know, the sky is under the earth, you know, constantly is very, it's very frustrating.  It's very stressful.  But understand that this will not serve them in the long run.  It might make for great Fox News TV for a week or a month or even a couple of months.  But in the long run, this process will show the Republicans to be who they really are.  Understand that in these times, we're all being asked that question, what do you believe?  And we can't really sit back.  We have to participate.  So the fact that we're asking this question and answering it is a good thing.  It allows you to know who really does care about democracy and the nation.  So don't go into despair as you're watching this.  Just see it as a revelation.  Trump is taking these guys down with him.  He's going to sink the party.  And, uh, every time they do something that appears wrong or unconstitutional, every single time this happens, then, uh, that, that just impeaches themselves.  They're not just Trump.  They're going to, they're going to have to face the voters and face why they did what they did.  And no one, no one Republican or Democrat is going to be happy about how the Republicans handle the Senate trial.  So take good heart and remember.  it's all about you and the sense of how you are responding and how you are reacting.  Every individual is growing through this process, so don't despair.  Thanks for watching. ",
