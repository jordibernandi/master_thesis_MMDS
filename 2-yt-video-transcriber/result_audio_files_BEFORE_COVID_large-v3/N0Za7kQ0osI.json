I got a good one.  Roll it.  No charcoal grills are allowed.  An IRS security guard in Ohio facing one charge of aggravated menacing after pulling a gun on a Lucas County Sheriff's deputy.  The deputy, Alan Gaston, came to the IRS office to ask a question.  Gaston arrives in full uniform, badge, firearm visible.  Security guard informed Gaston he needed to put his gun in his car, and Gaston said that he could not do that.  That's when the security guard pulled a gun on the cop.  Gasson decided to de-escalate the situation.  The security guard followed him to the elevators and then tried to take him into custody at gunpoint.  Y'all, the security guard, fake ass, top flight security, tried to do a citizen's arrest on an actual cop. ",

All right, folks, marijuana stock.org has another great investment opportunity.  If you were lucky enough to invest in their last crowdfunding campaign, you know.  they raised a bunch of money in just a few months investing in legal marijuana farms.  Those initial investors now own shares.  a publicly traded company.  Last time, of course, many of you missed it.  Now you have a second opportunity.  They have a new investment opportunity that is as good, if not even better, than the last one.  I'm talking about industrial hemp CBD.  For those who don't know, the hemp plant is the cousin to marijuana.  Without much higher concentration, of cbd which means hemp cbd gives you all the medical benefits of marijuana without getting you high.  until recently hemp farming was practically illegal in the u.s and heavily regulated by the dea.  however the 2018 farm bill changed all of that making it legal to grow hemp cbd in the u.s and creating one of the largest commodities worldwide.  they need land to grow all of their plants which makes for an incredible investment opportunity.  And that's where our good friends at 420 Real Estate come in.  Their business model is simple.  They buy land that supports hemp CBD grow operations and lease it to licensed, high-paying tenants.  That's right, they are hemp CBD landlords.  And you can get in on the action by investing in this crowdfunding campaign for as little as $200 up to $10,000.  Like I said, you don't want to miss out on the opportunity to invest.  Go to MarijuanaStock.org.  That's MarijuanaStock.org.  Get in the game and get in the game now. ",
