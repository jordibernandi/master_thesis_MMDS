            "text": "Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your source for Second Amendment news.  Some major news has come out in the last couple days, since Wednesday actually, regarding the NRA, the National Rifle Association.  And in fact, what has transpired and ended as far as Friday, could actually disband the organization if the New York Attorney General argues things correctly regarding nonprofit law.  Let me bring you back to Wednesday.  There was an article, and I'll link both articles that I'm talking about in the description so that you could read them for yourself just to show these aren't my facts.  These are facts that people who actually are in the know and spoke to people in the organization got.  So this started Wednesday in an article from the New Yorker.  in which they were interviewing a former NRA employee of 10 years and his name is Aaron Davis and he has basically become a whistleblower of what is going on inside the NRA that some of the workers find questionable to put it politely.  I have a list of things that I got from both of these articles that are highlight points so I'm going to refer to them and if you want more information Like I said, the links will be in the description so that you can follow up on your own.  So the first big red flag that came out, and it's interesting that we're talking about red flags within the NRA since they're the ones who backed the red flag bill.  But so one of the big red flags that the NRA that has happened so far that lead to the information where they could be in some serious trouble is the newsletter of the fundraiser that came out in March of 2019.  And among other things that they said that Wayne LaPierre said in there that the NRA cannot survive without your help right now.  And they've also, in the NRA offices, they've stopped giving out free coffee in the office and stopped bottled water delivery.  So when there's smoke, there's fire.  And I think when I give you these bullet points, you're going to agree that this is something serious.  So according to their employee, Aaron Davis, it started back in 2017 when the NRA had to borrow millions of dollars from its own foundation.  its officers' life insurance policies, and it also liquidated several million dollars more from an investment fund.  Couple that with their fundraising efforts last year were $35 million less than they were the year before.  Also, Mr.  Davis reports that when he first started there, everybody thought of these executives as very, very powerful men.  But back when he started in 05, they were paid in excess of $400,000 a year.  And while everybody thought that was a lot of money, they thought that these people were worth it because they could save the Second Amendment.  But they've become even more higher paid.  A couple of the executives make more than a million dollars a year, and they're a non-profit agency.  In fact, according to Davis, they've extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the non-profit budget, which is where their problems may have started.  We've seen in the news the last couple days that they've filed a lawsuit against their own advertising company, Ackerman McQueen.  That's the firm they've been using for quite some time, and they're suing them based off of concerns of accounting practices and activities, which suggests that the NRA doesn't. ",
