            "text": "So I was wondering whether you thought climate change could be an issue that could unite us all on left and right, moving us beyond debates about C-16 to discussions at the UN Katowice next month, where perhaps humanity might finally discover its global map of meaning.  No.  How dare you?  You have stolen my dreams.  On the 23rd of September, 2019, Greta Thunberg, and yes, that is how her name is pronounced, gave a, let's say, passionate speech to world leaders at the UN.  People are suffering.  People are dying.  Entire ecosystems are collapsing.  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.  How dare you?  And like a forest fire in the Amazon, it spread fast, garnering both massive support and praise.  Greta Thunberg terrifies me and I love her for it.  She doesn't want to inspire us or give us hope.  She wants to give us nightmares because we deserve them.  And conversely, it garnered massive backlash and criticism.  She's a kid.  She talks nonsense.  She knows little and does less.  She should be at school, but we see this sort of attention instead, and she tells the climate alarmists exactly what they want to hear.  But luckily, after some admittedly initial friction, the polarising groups were able to calm down and discuss the topic amicably and respectfully.  They listened charitably to one another, and eventually, the sceptics conceded that the science is overwhelming.  Human-induced climate change is a very real issue that demands our immediate collective attention.  That not everyone who claims to care about the climate is virtue signalling, and that we can all, easily, make small changes in our lives that will have large results.  Take your canvas bags to the supermarket.  And likewise, the climate activists conceded that there is a bit of a quasi-religious eschatology around their movement.  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.  That their leaders applauding Greta only to then fly home is hypocritical, and that as wonderful and passionate as Greta is, she has been deliberately weaponised for political gain.  They then all smiled, hugged, had a good cup of tea, which was fair trade of course, but delivered via air freight so that everyone was unhappy.  Then they worked together to find nuanced solutions that are considerable of everyone's concerns and... no.  It was a shit show.  Obviously.  You stole my childhood.  Do what I want you to do or else you're evil.  How do you respond to statements like that?  The truth is you can't respond.  And of course, that's the point.  Greta's campaign has brought out a fierce backlash from misogynists because preserving a livable planet has somehow become a threat to the entitlements of masculine primacy.  Greta Thunberg is not about the environment.  She's about aiding and abetting left-wing neo-Marxists and their bid to dominate the Western political order.  This last week, led by Greta, the world's children are striking.  I think there's a. There's an emergency that we are, it's a race against time and one in which we are losing.  For many activists, it isn't about science or facts, policy or debate, it's faith.  According to a recent study, men may even be less likely to recycle.  Just because they're worried, people will think they're gay.  Belief in something greater, something they don't necessarily understand, can't explain and won't comprehend, like the Judeo-Christian religion.  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.  In 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis.  I can't wait for Stephen King's sequel, Children of the Climate.  There's no excuse for not knowing that.  And I think the most troubling part of it is that I don't believe that there's anybody in this world that can deny science.  Oh, my prince, you and your privately educated buddies would be surprised.  But it's not the science that I'd like to talk about in this video.  Rather, I'd like to discuss the utter failure of discourse around this topic.  I'd like to explore the frustrations of, and empathise with, those who accept the science of human-induced climate change, but have not, and likely will not, change their behaviour accordingly.  But before doing that, I'd like to quickly make a disclaimer.  In the past, when I've shown two or more extreme views, I've been accused of committing a middle ground fallacy, but as is the case with those other subjects, is also the case here.  I'm not implying that the answer is bang in the middle of these views.  It's not.  Rather, I'm emphasising that the answer is somewhere between the far-right libertarians who are convinced that it's their right to shit in your water supply, and the far-left Marxists who are also convinced that it's their right to shit in your water, because your water is their water.  Put simply, I'm just trying to make the discourse a little more amicable.  I want people to understand the concerns of others more accurately, I want people to be more empathetic towards one another, not to demonise them.  I want to fight, effectively, against the uphill battle that is polarisation.  Yeah, good luck, pal.  That's almost impossible.  Oh, you did it.  Nice.  So with that, I'm Stephen Woodford.  Thanks for joining me.  And this is when facts are not enough.  At its core, climate change, and to what extent we are contributing, is strictly a scientific enterprise.  The absolute, absolute consensus is that human action is leading to an increase in average temperatures.  But the question of why people don't accept or act according to the evidence is multifaceted.  It involves psychology, ideology, politics, education, economics, and privilege.  Just a routine privilege too.  And within this video, I'm going to touch upon each of these.  The most significant facets, at least in my opinion, are psychological, but we'll address them last since they're predicated upon other contributions and thus will be easier to unpack later.  Given this, let's begin with a criticism that's both straightforward and frequently given, that being that many climate activists are naive.  The fact that stopping economic development... is even being advocated by some of the world's most privileged students.  I don't want to use the name or the word spoiled, but that's what many outside these facilities may think about the kind of comments we've heard.  Reveals how far removed this green bubble is from the harsh reality of billions of people who are desperately trying to escape poverty.  a multifaceted world undergoing rapid development and people in Asia and Africa want to have the same living standards as Sweden.  Put simply, many critics see many activists, and especially those with economic ideologies, as dangerously naive.  They see them as essentially walking into impoverished countries and saying, hey, you know how we had the industrial revolution and that because of it we are now a global superpower that's exploited you many times over?  Yeah, well, you're not allowed that revolution.  I know, I know, you're just trying to cook that rat on a bonfire to feed your starving family, but you have to understand, you're robbing a Swedish child of her childhood, and that makes you a monster.  This satire, of course, seems hyperbole, and to an extent it is, but it's also not.  It is, after all, a paraphrased fusion of some of the top comments on Benny Pizer's speech.  These critics argue that, as it stands, green energy sources are seldom viable to impoverished people, and if we hamstring such people by taxing sources that are viable to them, such as oil, gas, and coal, which together constitute 87% of worldwide energy, we stand to cause the poor massive personal and economic harm.  And furthermore, we stand to benefit the rich.  Just imagine who is reaping the hundreds of billions that are going into renewables.  It's the landowners, It's the people who can afford solar panels, solar farms, biogas.  It's those people who can afford all this green stuff paid by ordinary families, by poor families who are forced to pay the rich for their virtual signaling.  But to get back on track, the point being is that many find climate ideologues to be naive.  And whether you share this view or not, it's at least healthy to understand why others have this perspective.  A second criticism of note, which is in part an extension of naivety, is that climate change is a First World privilege problem.  To be clear, those who state this are not saying that climate change will only affect First World countries, but rather that only affluent social classes can afford to take the threat seriously.  For example, here's how Brendan O'Neill puts it.  I actually think it's morally repugnant that in a world in which 3 billion people still live in poverty, the discussion that is obsessing privileged, mostly white Westerners is how can we slow down economic growth?  Now, the goal of climate activists is not, of course, to slow down economic growth, and Brendan knows this, he's just employing some good old British sarcasm, and yeah, that's right, it's ours, we invented sarcasm, we trademarked it, just as we trademarked the oil in many countries.  Anyhow, here's Jordan Peterson expressing the same sentiment.  except the data that I've read indicate that if you can get the GDP of people up to about $5,000 a year, then they start caring about the environment, and the environment cleans up.  The argument that's being presented, more than less, is that we need to spend money to make money.  We need to produce more CO2 in order to ultimately reduce our production of CO2.  Now whether you endorse this argument or not, there is indeed data to support it.  While people, including my former self, drastically underestimate how much the poor care about the environment, the poor do statistically care less than other classes.  And from a psychological perspective, this isn't a surprise.  If one's physiological and safety needs are not met, one can't afford to care about such concerns as climate change.  Again, a response to this might be, bro, green energy is actually more viable to invest in, especially given the long run.  And a reply to this might be, yes, but bro-sive, the truly poor won't have a long run if they invest in green energy.  And then a reply to this might be, bro, seriously, my dad would beat the absolute crap out of your dad.  You stole my childhood.  But the underlining, very serious problem here is that we don't have time to test this hypothesis.  We only have one world.  The apocalyptic claim of the world ending in 12 years is no doubt ridiculous, but if our data and interpretations are correct, that is, if the vast majority of our scientists are correct, another 12 years of apathy may just push us beyond a safe return.  We do have to take this very seriously, and at the moment, most of us don't.  Moving on, a third criticism that's given by many critics is that many climate activists are hypocritical, and often insufferably so.  Lambasting the youth of the world for lassoing themselves to these protest marches and Greta and so on, and then immediately going back to their laptops, their iPads, their iPhones, their air-conditioned classrooms, their air-conditioned schoolrooms, their bathrooms, and so on and so on, their mums taking them to school in nice gas-guzzling cars.  In other words, many critics see many activists talking a good game, but when push comes to shove, the activists themselves don't even practice the principles they're trying to force upon others.  To illustrate this, take, for example, the following clip from Earthling Ed's channel.  Ed is a vegan activist, and he recently attended a climate change protest in London to encourage climate activists to go vegan.  He began by asking them how they can reduce their emissions.  Name some ways that we can reduce emissions.  Well, that's for the government.  You know, we're just here to protest.  They figure that out.  They've got a scientist.  And after a bit of back and forth, the activists gave some great responses, such as cutting subsidies for fossil fuels.  Electric cars.  Electric cars.  Plastic.  Plastic.  Yeah.  Don't litter.  From charity shops.  There we go.  Secondhand clothing.  Yeah.  Secondhand clothing.  What else?  Turn the lights off.  What about what we eat?  Ed then went on to explain, with more patience than a few civilisations, that if one wants to reduce their carbon footprint, then a surefire way of doing so is to reduce one's consumption of animal products.  But the activist's response was as indifferent as many critics are to foregoing fossil fuels, Do you think the taste of something is worth the destruction it causes?  Yeah, I'll be dead one day.  So why are you here of that logic then?  We're on the way to Subway actually.  So you're a vegan sandwich in Subway?  Yeah, but it's not as good as the steak and cheese.  What about the environmental impact?  Well, the steak and cheese is already there.  So, I mean, me not eating it isn't going to stop them.  But so is the plastic in the shelves and the diesel in the cars.  Now, it's important to note, as Ed himself did, that one doesn't need to be vegan to care about the environment.  That would be a form of purity testing or no true Scotsman.  However, the attitude of these activists is hypocritical.  They couldn't come across as more disingenuous if they wanted to.  And when you're in Subway, try the vegan sandwich.  You never know.  You never know.  I will not do that, but thank you for the suggestion.  Well, the environment is crying over that decision.  See you later, guys.  If you ever meet the environment, tell them I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry.  I love me.  If the activists had admitted their hypocrisy, but conveyed that doing something is better than doing nothing, then they could be taken more seriously.  But when they fervently campaign against polluting industries and practices that they don't personally use on a daily basis, but callously defend polluting industries and practices that they personally do use on a daily basis, they come across as aggravatingly hypocritical.  Couple this with the fact that most of them enjoy central heating, air conditioning, hot baths, the latest clothing accessories, a new iPhone every year, Amazon Prime, and high-speed internet, and the hypocrisy becomes insufferable.  Why should someone forgo their gas-guzzling truck, something that they enjoy on a daily basis, if these privileged teens won't forgo a bit of meat, something that they enjoy on a daily basis?  Now a reply to this, which I think is fair, is that these teens don't represent the climate movement, and the fact that critics treat them as if they do is little more than a strawman fallacy.  And in reply to this, some critics will say, bro, the same is true of their leaders, just to a less extent, they're hypocrites.  And then some activists might reply, bro, even my mum could beat up your dad, and we go back to shit-topia.  You stole my childhood.  And last but not least, let's talk psychology.  The YouTube channel It's Okay To Be Smart has an excellent video dedicated to this very topic, titled Why People Don't Believe In Climate Science, and honestly, I could just leave a link to that video and be done.  But I want to emphasise many of the same points and add a few of my own.  Al Gore famously titled his 2006 climate change documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, and in my opinion, it's a perfect title.  Climate change is an inconvenient truth because we are utterly unequipped to confront it.  We evolved on the plains of Africa, dealing with immediate personal threats, and so we are not hardwired to deal with threats that we ourselves won't endure.  We are, in fact, wired to dismiss these threats.  We are wired for hyperbolic discounting.  As George Marshall, Daniel Kahneman, and many others have emphasised, in our desire to avoid the anxiety that climate change generates, we actively conspire with one another and mobilise our own biases to keep it perpetually in the background.  Our optimism bias comforts us with the delusion that climate change won't affect us or our progeny, just others.  Our tribalistic tendencies, our need for social acceptance, want us not to rock the boat and risk ostracisation, our bias towards the status quo and fear of change prevent us from innovation, and to protect our cherished ideologies, we so easily endorse headlines that confirm our presuppositions and demonise and conflate those that don't.  Or as Joe Hanson puts it, Climate change is almost the perfect problem.  We've got to do something about it.  But every one of its attributes goes against our psychology.  It's like that black cloud from Lost.  It has no identity, no home, no single cause, and no single solution.  It's about more than science.  It involves economics, morals, human rights, ideology, technology.  It's really hard.  Anyhow, in conclusion, my dad would definitely beat up your dad.  Childish humour aside, I hope that whatever your views on climate change are, and the politics that surround it, you walk away from this video with a bit more empathy for those who don't share your views.  Now, don't get me wrong, there are nutters on both sides \u2013 well, more on one side than the other \u2013 and that your cognitive bias assume which I'm referring to.  And yes, these people are pretty much untouchable.  They're convinced, and that's that.  They're essentially variations of the Bible.  bashers who proudly state that if the Bible says so, it's so.  But most people are not like that, and in this day and age of echo chambers and outrage, we are in desperate need for amicable discourse, and without it, we may all be in trouble.  With that, I'm Stephen Woodford, and as always, thank you kindly for the view, and an extra special thank you to my wonderful patrons and those of you who have supported the channel via other means.
