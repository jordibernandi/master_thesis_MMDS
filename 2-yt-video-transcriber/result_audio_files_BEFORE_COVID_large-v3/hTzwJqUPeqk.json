            "text": "This is the New York Times on Earth, reporting live from Paris, France.  We have Vanessa here with the press.  Okay, things are setting off here.  So he's got rid of their blackjack baton.  Fireworks are being thrown at the cops.  Cops are answering back.  With, of course, rubber bullets.  Dangerous rubber bullets, which have made a bunch of people... Oh, they can't.  He was just firing that.  I almost got hit by one right now.  Again, I got all my protective gear.  Got my helmet, got my mask.  Police are moving in now from this way.  Metal's being thrown.  What we're seeing here is echoes of revolution.  Ethos of what's happening in Venezuela has happened in Ukraine before.  A massive accident by the people.  That has been happening for over 13 weeks.  The center of Paris, San Zizile, has literally been shut down for over 13 weeks.  Again, a lot of people are running here.  Let's see what's going on.  Okay guys, all of this reporting will not be possible if it wasn't for you.  Okay, let's go.  How's it going, what did you see?  I was kind of paralyzed for like 10 minutes from the tear gas.  Where's your gas mask?  uh it broke.  put on your gas mask again guys the italian government.  Oh, God.  Okay, guys.  It's Luke Renowski reporting live again.  Oh, the tear gas.  We were also told this week.  It's stronger than it is.  It's debilitating.  I can't see.  This is I'm sorry, guys.  I'm having a hard time.  My gas mask is on correctly.  Tear gas is so strong.  Again, huge protests happening now.  You can't see it.  If we're blacks and blacks, it goes on.  My face is on fire.  And my eyes are crying.  Huge battle, fireworks with police answering back.  Right before we started filming, we saw another complication with an officer using those rubber bullets.  that have been taking out people's eyes.  He actually aimed it on a protester's face, point blank.  That's why I started filming.  Again, it looks like the officers are kind of stuck here.  And the protesters are all around them.  There have been some protesters calling for peace and to stop all this.  And there's also been a lot of protesters initiating the violence today.  Oh, made the fireworks again going up.  Again, guys, we're actually live right now.  Oh, another huge piece of wood flying at the cap.  What the hell's going on?  We've got medics moving in.  The street medics have been incredibly helpful here.  I'm going to go over to see what they're doing.  It looks like the protesters are deciding to give these guys peace as much as they can.  Run over here.  The medics, again, are asking not to film the people who are hurt.  So we're not.  I don't think I want to know what that is.  There's a big argument happening.  I already saw a number of crashes between the yellow vests who want to keep the peace and of course protesters who want vengeance and want violence with the police.  Right now it looks like the faction that wants vengeance and wants violence with the police is winning.  Again guys, just released a video with my staff on the ground about the bigger geopolitical aspects of this.  France has actually recalled their diplomats from Italy because Italy is criticizing Macron.  Let's hear gas.  Face is on fire.  It's also important to stand here.  that the front authorities have also been passing laws to make it illegal for people to protest without a permit and to cover their face.  And they're making the crime for that more serious than what it was before with more punishment.  Okay, she's great.  This is a war zone.  This is 13 weeks of unrest.  By and large, largely ignored.  Largely, largely ignored by the mainstream media press in America.  Okay, we're here.  We got a live stream going right now.  So definitely tune in.
