            "text": "Oh, thanks, garbage truck.  you chose the perfect time to start doing your thing.  Hey everyone, it's me, Tristan, and I know it's been a little bit, but hey, shuffling the stuff around on the channel, and so now Quick Steps are gonna be on Mondays, and this is the first one of those.  So last week, actually when I'm recording this on Friday, it's been exactly one week, there was a horrible mass shooting in New Zealand, and I did a Twitter thread about it that got a lot of attention for Step Back, you know?  I want to tell you about a popular YouTuber.  Maybe the most popular YouTuber.  You're doing pretty well.  You have your, you know, video game YouTube channel where you scream at games about, you know, robots and pizza places, and it gets you really, really popular with the young boys.  Come 2014, those young boys start complaining about... I don't know, ethics in video games journalism, the women folk are taking away our video games.  You know, all of the beginnings of the rise of the far right that has become really normal in 2019 is terrifying.  So you know that your audience has these reactionary views, and you know as a smart business person that young men are looking for something to belong to.  This is one of the oldest stories of teenagerdom that's around.  and they have all of these feelings of anger towards anyone who really doesn't look like them and you want them to associate belonging with you.  so you know you get a little edgy you try to you know.  bait a little bit of the racism bait a little bit of the sexism.  maybe you make a couple anti-semitic jokes you say a couple racial slurs on your stream gamer words if you will and And when that happens, you lose some sponsorships.  Maybe even a major newspaper writes a negative article about you.  But you don't want to buy into that.  You don't think that you're part of this far right movement.  You're just rejecting all this.  It's just jokes.  It's just memes, guys.  But you know what?  It helps.  The more you cozy up to the far right, the more your subscribers jump up, the more money you rake in.  Why is that?  Well, historically, I mean, if you should watch my video on fascism here, you'll know that capitalism and fascism go hand in hand pretty well, and that catering to the worst instincts of people, especially people who feel alienated and unable to belong to something, it makes for good business.  There's a reason why both of the fascist movements that started in Europe, the big ones anyway, Italy and Germany, happened with the help of the capitalist classes in both cases.  But if you're just a gaming YouTuber, you're probably not thinking about the far right and the Capitalization on this sort of funnel towards radical Nazism.  you just want to make money guys and who knows as a white guy yourself Maybe your sympathies do go in that direction.  It's not super important really and all the people who since the Friday shooting have fallen on their swords screaming at the top of their lungs that this youtuber obviously has Nothing that they need to think about.  there's no reflection at all needed in the wake of somebody saying subscribe to this channel before murdering 50 people.  But you know, nobody's saying that it's his fault, a lot of people are saying it should be a wake-up call.  And this is the thing that I think a lot of the reactionary right since the shooting have not been handling properly, which for people who are supposedly pro-business, they don't exactly understand the concept of a sales funnel.  As somebody who is, weirdly enough, an owner of their own business, and on top of that, someone who works in fundraising, a sales funnel is something that comes up quite a bit in both of those circles.  You realize that when you talk and communicate with groups of people, you need to use different types of messaging at different levels.  The biggest part of the funnel, when someone who has never heard of you, it's just about making awareness.  It's just about shouting them out in your YouTube video.  Oops, oh wait, or it's just about having them on your followers list on Twitter.  You know, at that point, the messaging you put out at that level is just about making people aware that you exist.  After that, it's about making people sympathize with your position, and then getting people to be firm followers of your position, and all along the way, hopefully more and more money is being exchanged in your direction.  It's gross, and it is... Perfect for talking about the process of turning somebody into a customer, for example, but also works for the indoctrination of people into radical politics, especially the radical right, which functions a lot like a cult in some cases, but we'll get into that later.  probably in a future video.  But this is the path towards radicalization.  So when we're talking about this YouTuber who has, I think I just saw 80 million subscribers, while he does not talk about openly fascist things, openly Nazi things, he just sort of nudges people in that direction, subtly, not even by explicit things, although I would say the racial slurs and the Nazi jokes are, pretty good signs, but let's give him all the benefits of all the doubt and say that it's just memes guys.  He shouts out Nazis.  He follows Nazis on Twitter.  He platforms them and just gets people a little bit, a little bit closer.  You know, one step down the funnel.  Even if it's not most of the people that follow him.  Maybe if it's just 1% of the people follow him.  When that's 80 million people, that's still a lot of people.  You could say that this is pretty common of your classical liberal internet intelligentsia, intelligentsia, your Jordan Petersons, your Dave Rubens, you know, your Steven Crowders, those types.  They might not be openly fascist.  They might not even think that they are Nazis themselves.  It really doesn't matter.  It's that they are uncritically engaging with right-wing ideas or basically being completely, uh, open-ended and exposure is why platforms are important and platforms carry with them responsibility.  It's then that they step further and further and further down the path towards radicalization.  And then, you know, this YouTuber wakes up on a Friday morning and hears it.  in New Zealand, somebody said, subscribe to your channel before murdering 50 people and injuring 50 more, the deadliest mass shooting in New Zealand's history.  And yeah, I know that there's probably like 6,000 comments about, oh, his manifesto, it's all ironic.  Trust me, I've been hearing this for years now, that Donald Trump's election, it was just jokes, that it wasn't actually gonna happen, or that, you know, all the people who are saying all this white nationalist stuff on 4chan, it's just ironic, they're just being ironic.  Completely lacking the, you know, mere exposure effect idea of it.  But, you know, whatever.  And as I said before, nobody, nobody is saying that PewDiePie is responsible for the deaths of these 50 people. ",
