In mid-March 1957, we received an urgent message from the Alexandria Police Department.  The message indicated that two of their on-duty police officers had picked up an alien who had landed some 14 miles south of Pentagon Boulevard and the occupant was transported to the Pentagon to meet with the Under Secretary of Defense and then was shuttled underground to meet with President Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon.  The meeting lasted for nearly an hour and then the alien visitor was put on VIP status and was shuttled back to the Pentagon where he spent the night in the Army Reception Office.  The alien's name was Valiant Thor. ",
