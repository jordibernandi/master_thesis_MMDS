The show featured the first same-sex commitment ceremony ever shown on American primetime TV, plus a gay character played by Richard Roundtree, also known as Shaft.  And it came at a turning point for queer folks both on TV and in real life.  All aboard and welcome to Matt Baume's Culture Cruise, where we take a deep dive on queer themes in entertainment we love.  This time we're checking out the episode Can't Help Loving That Man from season one of the Fox sitcom Rock.  Despite being a super important part of TV history, this is a hard one to find.  It's not streaming anywhere, and it's not in any of the archives that I checked.  But thanks to viewers Jean-Pierre, Chris, and MinusMinusOne, we were able to track it down and bring it to you now.  So big thanks to all the viewers who helped bring this video together.  And Culture Cruise is made possible by everyone who pledges their support on Patreon.

Rock was an early 90s sitcom set in Baltimore about the Emerson family.  Rock, his wife Eleanor, his brother Joey, and his father Andrew.  The episode, that aired on October 20, 1991, starts with Andrew expecting a visit from his little brother Russell. ",

Various surveys around this time showed that a majority of Americans thought that homosexuality was morally unacceptable and should be illegal.  Plus, 64% of Americans said that they would be very upset to learn that their child was gay.  to just 17 percent today.  Not to mention, 1991 was in the middle of the darkest days of the HIV epidemic, which had a huge impact on the African American community.  By 1993, HIV had become the country's single largest killer of young African American men, and the second largest cause of death for young African American women.  And at the time, there was a lot of stigma that tied HIV to gay men.  So that's what was happening in real life.  Meanwhile, on television, gay episodes tended to be the most serious of very special episodes.  Those were the episodes where the gay guest of the week was a point of crisis, homosexuality caused a problem, and there was dramatic music whenever going to commercial.  In 1991, TV audiences had been trained to recognize that when you see a gay character, it means things are about to get serious.  Andrew tries to keep it light. ",

Well, it has been an exhausting day so far in the Emerson household, and we're still in Act One.  When we come back from commercial, Andrew's puzzling over the situation at a bar.  He doesn't know what to do, he doesn't know what to say, he doesn't even know what to feel.  His disorientation reflects an early 90s shift in both gay politics and gay representation on TV.  Remember how I said in the 80s gay episodes tended to be super serious?  Well, during that time, gay characters also tended to be super lonely.  TV seldom acknowledged that gay people could actually, you know, meet each other and fall in love.  Every now and then you'd see a same-sex couple, like on this episode of Kate and Ally.  This is Miriam Goodman, my lover.  But it was far more common for a single queer person to appear for just one episode, for that episode to be super serious, and then for them never to show up ever again.  However, that was all starting to change at the exact moment this episode aired.  In 1991, TV was shifting from tragedy and loneliness to show actual gay relationships.  You can see it very clearly on shows like The Golden Girls.  In 1986, they had an episode about a lonely lesbian widow.  In 1988, Blanche's brother comes out as gay.  And in 1991, that brother wants to get married.  In the early 90s, a lot of shows, even married with children, started acknowledging gay relationships for the first time.  With varying levels of tact.  You're a husband?  Yes.  You know you're a guy, right?  That happened in part because of something that was happening in real life.  About a year before this episode aired, same-sex couples in Hawaii started pursuing a legal strategy towards marriage.  I talked about that a little more in my video about marriage with children.  There's a link to that in the description.  The idea that gay couples might be able to marry someday was something that seemed impossible just a few years earlier, but now it was making actual real-life headlines.  Gay, lesbian, and unmarried heterosexual couples may now get official recognition as domestic partners.  Hundreds of couples turned up at City Hall yesterday to obtain this new symbolic legal status.  Shows like Rock and Married with Children and The Golden Girls reflected what was happening in real life.  But Rock was the first American primetime show to actually show a ceremony.  And we wouldn't see another until Roseanne and Friends a couple years later.  At least, I'm pretty sure this is the first.  If you know of something earlier, let me know.  When the big day comes, Andrew is upset.  That the couple is gay, and that they're interracial.  At first he wants to act like the ceremony isn't even happening.  And when Russell's offended, he gets indignant. ",

This is the exact opposite of the gay characters that we saw on TV in the past.  He's not lonely, he's not in crisis, he's not a one-and-done guest.  He's confident, he's present with the family, he's loved by them, and he loves his partner.  Nowadays, we've come to expect qualities like that from queer characters, but at the time this episode aired, that was all pretty new.  What we're seeing when we look at these early 90s episodes of TV is a foundation being laid for the good, strong, happy queer characters that we can take for granted today.  Land ho, we're pulling into port!  Thanks for cruising along with us, and thanks to everyone who makes Culture Cruise possible with a pledge of support on Patreon.  Folks like Terry Picknall.  There's some lovely rewards for folks who back the show.  Head over to Patreon.com slash Matt Baume, or click the link in the description to check out those backer rewards.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta take this call.  Hello?  The police are tracing this call this very minute. ",
