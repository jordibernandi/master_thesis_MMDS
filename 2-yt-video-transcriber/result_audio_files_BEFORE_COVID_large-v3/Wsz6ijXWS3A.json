I simply, I simply, my problem would be this one.  What you describe as... Postmodern neo-Marxism, where is really the Marxist element in it?  They are for equality.  Sorry, where?  They are for equality at these cultural struggles, proper names, how do we call each other.  Do you see in them, in political correctness and so on, any genuine will of equality?  to change society.  I don't see it.  I think it's a hyper-moralization, hyper-moralization, which is a silent admission of a defeat.  That's my problem.  Why do you call, give me, again, it's not a rhetorical question for politely saying you are an idiot, you don't know what you're talking about.  It's simply, I would like to know Because you, and I like this often, when you attack somebody, you say aggressively, and what should, read more, tell me whom.  So I'm asking you now, not read more, I don't advise you, but who are, give me some names and so on, and who are these post-modern egalitarian neo-Marxists, and where do you see any kind even of Marxism?

            "text": "I guess that's where we might have a dispute, because I think what happened, especially in France in the 1960s, is as the radical Marxist postmodern types like Derrida and Foucault realized that they were losing the moral battle, especially after the information came out of the Soviet Union in the manner that it came out.  Yeah, that the whole bloody Stalinist, the whole Stalinist catastrophe, along with the entire Maoist catastrophe, that they didn't really have a leg to stand on.  And instead of revising their notion that human history, and this is a Marxist notion, should be regarded as the eternal class struggle between the economically deprived and the oppressors, they just recast it and said, well, it's not based on economics, it's based on identity, but it's still fundamentally oppressor against oppressed.  And to me, that meant that they smuggled the fundamental narrative of Marxism and many of its goals back into the argument without ever admitting that they did so.  Now, I've been criticized for this supposition because... people who are postmodernists say, look, one of the hallmarks of postmodernism is skepticism of meta-narratives.  It's like, I know that perfectly well.  And I also know that Marxism is a meta-narrative, and so you shouldn't be able to be a postmodernist and a Marxist.  But I still see the union of those two things in the insistence that the best, the appropriate way to look at the world is to view it as the battleground between groups defined by a particular... between individuals defined by a particular group identity, so that the group identity becomes paramount, and then the proper reading is always oppressor versus oppressed.  With a secondary insistence that's very similar to Marx's insistence upon the moral superiority of the proletariat, that the oppressors are by definition, because they're oppressed, morally superior.  And there's the call for perhaps not revolutionary change, although that comes up above, but change in the structure so that that oppression disappears, so that a certain form of equality comes about.  Now, you argued that Marx wasn't a believer in equality of outcome, and I'm not so sure about that, because his notion of the eventual utopia that would constitute genuine communism was a place where all class divisions were eradicated.  And so there's at least... Well, there's at least an implication that the most important of the hierarchies had disappeared.  And so maybe he had enough sophistication to talk about other forms of hierarchies.  But if that's the case, then I can't imagine why he thought that the utopia that would emerge as a consequence of the elimination of economic hierarchies would be a utopia.  Because if there were other forms of hierarchies that still existed, people would be just as contentious about them as they are now.  Like we have hierarchies of attractiveness, for example.  that have nothing to do with economics or very little to do with economics, and there's no shortage of contention around that or any other form of ability.  And so that's why I associate the social justice types who are basically postmodernists with Marxist... They're post-modernist with Marxism.  It's the insistence that you view the world through the narrative of oppressed versus oppressor.  And I think it's a catastrophe.  I think it's a catastrophe.  And you appear to think it's a catastrophe as well. ",

The good thing is to be on the margin, you know.  like not in the center and so on and so on.  it almost made me nostalgic for old communists who at least had the honesty to say no we don't enjoy our marginal position we want to do something.  central power I find so disgusting.
