            "text": "I'm Roy Potter, a former U.S.  Army Lieutenant Colonel.  Welcome to the Potter Expos\u00e9.  So where am I going with this thing with the Second Amendment?  I'm not talking about violent revolution.  I'm not talking about, you know, there's no way you could fight the American military anyway.  And that's really not what you want to do.  You want to align yourselves with competent constitutional sheriff authority, governor authority, those types of things, okay, if they exist.  And in some states they don't.  Some counties they don't.  But you need to search those people out and know who your allies are and who you can depend upon.  But as a statement of your support for the Second Amendment and your statement to make against these people that are saying that you have no Second Amendment rights or that they're going to define what they are, that they're going to take away your magazines that have, first it'll be 10 or more, and then it'll be five or more, and then it'll be one.  You know how that'll go, right?  It's a creep, right?  It's an interval.  They're going to say that, and then they're going to say, we want to take away your... semi-automatic, and then it'll go to your bolt action.  The only thing you can have is a single shot shotgun.  It'll be, no, you can't even have that.  You see where it's going.  Okay.  So how, how do, how do we make, how do we make a concerted effort as a people, both economically and politically to make a statement against that?  We have to put your money where your mouth is.  Okay.  Uh, And what I'm going to encourage you all to do is to exercise your Second Amendment rights in mass.  And I hope that you take at least this aspect of my video.  You can cut it out.  By the way, anybody can use any of my videos.  They're not up there.  They're not copyrighted.  You can send them out.  Use bits and pieces.  Just as long as you don't change the message.  Some people have done that and it really got me upset.  As long as you don't edit it to make me say something that I didn't say or... the principle that I'm trying to explain.  As long as you're not trying to do those things, change those, you can use them like you like.  So take this bit here if you like.  You need to put your money where your mouth is and tell these leftist Marxists and even the rhinos, Right?  That not only do you stand for the Second Amendment, but you are going to exercise that right.  A right is a responsibility.  And I've talked about this before.  It's not just a gift.  It's a responsibility.  Because if you have a right, that means that you are willing to take it and have an ability to respond.  response ability that's what it means.  you can't do it unless you want a firearm so i can't.  i can't make that statement and not put my money where my mouth is.  so again what i'm saying is if you do not have a firearm it is time for you especially a semi-automatic firearm be it handgun shotgun Or rifle.  You need to take that economic, political statement and put it into reality and purchase one, even if you have to borrow the money.  Borrow the money?  That's against everything, right?  I'm telling you that's how important it is.  Now, Obama, because of what he did, he was the greatest salesman for weapons in the history of the United States because everybody knew he was going to try to take away the guns, right?  And he didn't succeed in that.  But he has been funding elements both in and out of the government to make sure that happens eventually.  Okay?  And we're going to talk about that here again in a minute.  Trump has made some statements and has done some things that are contrary to the Second Amendment.  We need to send him a message.  So... With all of the threats that are being made about taking semi-automatic weapons, I imagine that gun sales have probably gone up again.  Don't sit idly by.  If you have a few hundred dollars aside, if you have any means at all to go out and to purchase a semi-automatic rifle, do so.  And I'm going to put my money where my mouth is, okay?  Having been in the military for 28-odd years and police for several years, I never wanted to ever have another military-style weapon, ever.  I just didn't want it.  However, due to the fact that I believe that this political statement has to be made and has to be made en masse, they have to be shown that they're not going to be able to confiscate or ban these weapons because Americans are buying them in the droves.  And then you need to Make agreements with your local sheriff, if they're constitutional, and your governor on how to defend these rights.  But the first step is to exercise the right and to make sure that you own one.  I heard Roger Stone say when he was raided that he's for the Second Amendment, but he's never owned a gun.  Well, then he's not for the Second Amendment the way he needs to be.  I'm not saying he's bad for doing that, but Again, you can't have a right that you don't exercise because it's a response ability, your ability to respond.  So I'm going to ask everybody today to make a commitment and to send this out, to make a commitment, to show that the American people are adamant that these threats to take away the weapons is unacceptable and that we're making a political statement in support of the Second Amendment with our pocketbooks.  So I went out and I got one.  AR-15.  Like I said, I carried one of these things for years.  And I never really ever wanted to even... I don't even like looking at them.  Okay?  So I bought this as a political statement.  I put my money where my mouth is.  It's a little more than I wanted to spend.  Right?  But... We have to make a statement.  And we have to tell these demons, both in the government and out of the government, that we won't stand for it, that we're going to vote, not just at the ballot box, but with our pocketbooks, with our cash, with our buying power, and say, not only are you not going to ban these weapons, but we're going to get them en masse.  And you can go to the next step and say Molin Labe if you want.  This isn't the time or the place for that.  I'm just telling you, to exercise a right, you must take responsibility.  You must obtain this or something like it so that you are exercising that right so that you can respond as necessary.  Your responsibility is And that's the first step in securing your rights is to exercise them.  So again, I made this commitment.  You know, like I said, it's the last thing I wanted.  I mean, literally, it's the last thing I wanted.  But we need to make this political statement now, today, not tomorrow, today.  economically, this will say a lot.  The numbers will say a lot.  And they have in the past few years, you know, they have.  But we need to get more serious about it.  And we need it to be something like this, okay?  The thing that they're trying to get rid of.  And I know that this has been used for evil.  It's been used for good, too.  Every tool can be used for good or evil.  The tool shouldn't be banned.  The criminal should be dealt with.  So go out and get one for you today.  Learn how to use it.  Take classes.  Of course, I went through many, many years on how to use these.  I'm very well trained.  I'll just leave it at that.  I'm very well trained.  And treat it safely.  Understand the concept of firearm safety.  But become proficient with it as well.  That's necessary.  But the first step is to have one.  is to have it, to spend the money, to make the political statement with your dollars that you support your right and the right of your neighbor to exercise the Second Amendment.  Do it today.  Like I said, I already made that commitment.  All right.  Talking about that free climbing, tree climbing, Smith & Wesson MPAR 15, MMP, Military and Police is reasonable.  Yeah, I think you can get those for about $500.  You know, just because they're using an AR-15 platform, there are different grades of quality.  And you need to research that for yourself.  But, you know, you're really not going to go to war with the thing.  That's not the issue here.  That's not what we're talking about.  So you don't need to have a weapon that's going to be able to fire 50,000 rounds without burning the barrel up or, you know, breaking an internal part or whatever.  It's the point of making the statement.  That's what's important.  So, yeah, a Smith & Wesson M&P would be fine to make that statement.  Just don't think that you're going to get 50,000 rounds through it because you're not.  There's a difference in the way the barrels are made, the type of steel, whether they're chromed or not.  There's a lot of issues there.  The important thing is to spend the money that you can and get something to make the statement.  You can build your own, for instance.  Yeah, that's a very good idea.  So study all that.  But what I'm saying right now is that we need to make this happen today within the next few days.  It needs to be a surge of purchases with people voting with their dollars that, no, you're not going to ban semi-automatic weapons or large capacity magazines, and you're sure as hell not going to confiscate them.  Okay.  That's the message that you need to be sending.  And that's the best way to do it in my estimation at this time.  But then be responsible and go the next step and learn how to use it.  You know, you know, you don't want to be having to go off by accident.  I mean, well-trained people have accidents.  I have a, I have a police officer friend who, who got an AR-15, I'm sorry, an AK-47.  Semi-auto was all it was.  He was in his house and he let his guard down.  He He knows to keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction, but he still had an unintended discharge through the ceiling out through the roof of his house.  So even well-trained people can have problems.  So that's why when you have something like this, you always check.  You always keep the barrel, the bore, you know, you always keep the barrel pointed in a safe direction.  And you double check three times whether it's loaded or not.  That's what you see here in this.  This is a plug here to show that there's nothing in the chamber, okay?  so that I know that it's not loaded, okay?  Now if that wasn't in there, let me just show you this so you know real quick.  If that wasn't in there, okay, And it was closed like that, and there's no magazine in there.  There could still be around in the chamber.  So you've got to keep it pointed in a safe direction.  So you always check the chamber.  And this one, you look in there, you put your finger in there, you make sure there's nothing there.  You've seen me do that when I was out with my 45-70.  Well, it's the same with these.  It's the same thing.  So you have to be very, very cautious as to where this thing is and what's in it.  So have the... The time and the money and the commitment to learn how to use your weapon.  Don't just buy one and then not go the next step and learn how to operate it safely, okay?  So there we go with the plug again, all right?  Yeah, a slingshot killed a giant.  Watchwoman on the wall, 2015, she's saying... And it's a very good point.  It's a very good point.  But you understand that going by the slingshot isn't going to make the political statement that needs to be made right now.  That's the point.  I love slingshots.  You know, I've used them.  I've used crossbow pistols, archery.  uh lots of other things.  so i understand what you're saying but we need to make a political statement now.  okay that's that's the point of all this.  whether you may hate guns okay learn to use the tool you know.  you may hate screwdrivers you know but someday you're going to have to use a screwdriver.  learn how to use it.  have it.  take the right precautions you know.  with a screwdriver you know you don't keep your hand in the way when you're pushing on something and stab yourself.  i mean any tool can hurt you if you don't use it right.  okay if you don't take take the uh the time to learn it.  I worry more about Antifa and that kind of a group than I do even the government.  You know, the red flag laws and the SWAT teams that are being used to steal people's rights and property are wrong, but you don't want to get in a shooting fight with those guys.  If they want them and they come, I'm not telling you to do that.  Again, I'm telling you to make a political statement.  If thousands, millions of people go out and buy one of these, In the next couple of days, do you realize the political statement that that will make?  It might put you down a few hundred bucks.  It might put you in debt.  But sometimes a debt is worth it when so much is on the line.  Yeah, for those of you in places like California where there are already restrictive gun measures involved, I'm not telling you to violate your local laws.  I'm not telling you to do that.  I do have a friend in California who is in the process of purchasing an AR-15.  He has to go through some type of a training thing and a registration or whatever, and he can't have more than a five-round magazine, but he's purchasing the weapon.  He's taking the steps to purchase the weapon.  Don't do it illegally, even though technically what they're doing to you is a violation of the Constitution.  The DOJ, like I said earlier, under Trump, should come in there and say, you're violating the rights of your staff.  of the residents of your state, cease and desist or we're going to come after you.  That's what Trump should be doing, not encouraging red flag laws and bump stock laws.  He's got it all reversed there, and it does make me very angry because it's like he doesn't really understand the concept.  He doesn't understand the principle.  Yeah, I'll make this statement.  Stephen Turner says ARs can run from about $400 and up into the thousands.  You get what you pay for.  Oh, that's true.  There are makes and models out there that are going to jam and all that.  So yeah, get the best weapon you can afford.  I'll just put it that way.  Get the best weapon you can afford.  If you can only afford $400, go make the statement.  If you can buy a $2,000 weapon, do that, all right?  But it's making the statement.  that's important.  And even the cheap ones will shoot.  They might not stand up for a long time.  You might have some jams and things like that, but you're making the statement, okay?  That's, again, what we're really after here. ",
