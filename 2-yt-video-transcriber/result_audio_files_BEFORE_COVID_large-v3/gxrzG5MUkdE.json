I helped him out with one of his videos, which he just pretty much has me tearing through a J.M.  Truth thing, so I figured that I would start out with J.M.  Truth's first Flat Earth video and see what evidence he actually has for the Flat Earth, and truly analyze where he's coming from.  So if you're interested in this and how disingenuous as fuck JM Truth is, then please stay tuned.  All right, so first we have something that's become common with the Flat Earth community, and that's his mischaracterization of what exactly is science and what isn't science, or rather, what is pseudoscience.

So it's quite interesting that he uses this, considering the fact that we're about to go over what he considers actual evidence and actual scientific rigor.  But to be clear, I want to state that all of these are indeed scientific fields.  Just so you know what actually constitutes whether or not a field is scientific, generally it has to meet at least most of these particular characteristics.  It has to have clearly defined terminology.  It has to have a quality of quantifiability.  Highly controlled conditions is also very important, as well as reproducibility and predictability and testability.  So any field that stands up to the rigor set forth by these principles can be considered a scientific field.  And so all of these pseudosciences that he lists here, it is indeed not pseudoscience.  These are actual scientific fields.  With the exception of a few on this list, because, I mean, he lists like astrology on here.  That's obviously not scientific.  So let's go on and see what is the foundation of J.M.  Truth's proof for a flat earth. ",

But really, I mean, he's just showing this in order to support his scriptures or to validate his scriptures or to show that his scriptures hold truth in some way.  So that's all that he's using this evidence for.  but let's actually attack the evidence that he provides.  First off, he misrepresents the eight inches per mile squared, labeling it as NASA's equation.  At best, you could say that this is a land surveyor's equation, because the equation is actually only fairly accurate within a few miles, or a very short distance, really, because it actually maps a parabola.  It doesn't map a sphere.  And it's real funny because if you notice on his little display there, he's actually got an Excel equation that you can put into Excel and calculate, I guess, how much distance is hidden by the curve.  But if you'll notice there, it's not eight inches per mile squared.  This really gets at the heart of what JM does and what you'll notice as we continue.  JM regularly misrepresents the truth.  As you can see on this one, he's misrepresenting what is even on his little figure there.  Also, to discuss this whole horizon rising to eye level, however high you go, that's indeed not accurate.  There are plenty of videos that you can go to out there that actually have, you know, a drone going up and seeing the horizon drop. ",

That would mean that the light coming off the Sun and the light it gives off should dwarf our planet.  This means we should not see any pinpoint of light at any point on the Earth.  If in fact that is the case and light travels straight in space due to it being a vacuum according to NASA, then can someone please explain to me how we have such a small hot spot on the Earth?  Being both a cinematographer and a photographer, I understand that a hotspot is created when a light source is directly above or directly on the object being lit up.  Again, this seems to defy the laws of true physics.  Any takers?  Because this picture clearly shows a hotspot on the planet Earth, implying that possibly the sun is just above those clouds, because otherwise there shouldn't be a hotspot.

Is he actually using a picture of the sun above the Earth and claiming that this proves that the Earth is flat, while at the same time showing a picture of the curve right there?  No, hot spots, this hot spots that he sees right there is actually just reflections coming off of a highly reflective surface on the earth, like water, something like that.  This isn't a hot spot like you would see in photography or if you were at a different perspective looking at the earth and seeing the glare from the sun coming off the earth.  Also, he showed a picture of crepuscular rays.  That's bullshit.  Those rays are indeed parallel and it's only because of your perspective that they appear to be sort of angled.

I think it's interesting.  they call it that, considering the fact that I'm going to show you another map that they identify differently.  Now this map here is called a Gleason's map, and it is a sailors map, what the sailors used to use for navigational charts.  If you look at the top of this map, here it says new standard map of the world, and look here, it says as it is.  Interesting.  So if this is what the world looks like, can someone please tell me what this is?  Oh yeah, it's CGI.  That's right.  It's a composite.  Go look at NASA's website. ",

So just because the Gleason's map says, as it is, doesn't mean that he actually thought that the world was flat.  Also, you will notice on this particular map, it designates that this is a projection, which means that they took another object and they projected it onto a flat surface.  That object being a sphere, of course.  But, as you have noticed so far, JM loves to distort the truth, even when he's showing it directly to you.  Now, the globe that he shows in this particular instance is also a composite, but you can tell that he doesn't actually have any kind of, like, photographic or cinematography kind of knowledge, or at least he wasn't good at it, because he would know that CGI and composite are completely different fucking things.  It cannot be both CGI and a composite.  The image that he showed is that famous Blue Marble 2 that all the flat earthers love to put out there saying that, oh, it's Photoshop because it has to be.  Well, it's a composite.  It's a visualization of a lot of different data sets that revealed to us many different things about our Earth, including its shape.  You know, I can't really take much more.  There's like 15 more minutes of his video.  I'll probably look through it and address it some other time.  In conclusion, I have determined that JM Truth is just a disingenuous pseudoscience peddler.  All he does is misrepresent evidence that he brings forward and tries to distort the truth of the things that he's actually showing you.  in order to fit his narrative or his faith to support his scriptures.  His entire argument is based on his faith in the Bible, or whatever the fuck it is he might believe.  He references the New Testament and the Old Testament.  Like, I've seen him reference Matthew and shit.  So I don't know what the fuck he is.  Thank you, Heathens, for making it to the end.
