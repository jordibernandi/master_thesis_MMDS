            "text": "Hi, it's Andrew here at Bayside.  On Monday, there was a moment of grief in the McCourt household as Isabel, my French wife, and I watched the news and we watched Notre Dame Cathedral on fire.  Our hearts were broken.  This incredible building that was made in the 1200s that is really not just the heart of Paris, it's the heart of France.  So many people look to this little island and this remarkable cathedral, and there it was on fire.  At one point I said, turn off the news.  I can't bear to watch it.  It's out of control.  The building's going to come down.  Well, the great news was, that the 500 firefighters, they valiantly fought the fire, they brought it under control.  And the next day, when the news teams were allowed to look through the front door, there was an image that will just live in my heart forever.  The fire was out, the ashes were everywhere, but the gold cross stood strong.  And everybody, I think that's the most amazing symbol that we can see on Good Friday today.  That no matter what happens in our world, no matter how much culture changes, no matter how much fire comes against my life, you know what?  The cross always stands firm.  And it's God's signal that no matter what I've done in the past, what I do at the moment, or even the mistakes I make in the future, the self-inflicted fire in my life, that God is there for me, the cross still stands strong.  And if you're a Christian today, this is a day that is full of hope.  Of course, we grieve at what it cost our Savior, but we are thrilled at what it means for our lives.  And if you're not yet a Christian, can I encourage you, maybe find a place today to bow the knee before the cross of Jesus, receive his forgiveness, receive his love.  And if you're anywhere near one of our Bayside campuses, make sure to come to your service this weekend and rejoice over the remarkable death of Jesus and his incredible resurrection.  We look forward to seeing you. ",
