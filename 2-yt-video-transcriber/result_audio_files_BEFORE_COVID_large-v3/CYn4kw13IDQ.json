            "text": "Howdy folks, Kel here.  Well, I'm in the back deck.  I'm smoking a Punch Double Corona.  This is not the Maduro, this is just the regular Punch Double Corona.  I'll put down below here what kind of wrapper it has and the fillers and ingredients and everything.  I didn't read them before I came out as usual because I was in a hurry as usual to get out here and smoke a cigar before the light faded and it faded anyway.  This is the first one I've had.  I've never had a Punch Double Corona.  I've had other Punch cigars in the past, many, many, many years ago.  I hadn't smoked them for many years.  Now, I tried that Punch Grand Piro last year.  I really liked it, and I bought a box of them.  And I bought several variations of Punch because I kind of really enjoyed it.  I believe Punch is a Honduran cigar.  I may have to correct myself in the video here, but I think it is a Honduran cigar generally.  And I think I can taste definite Honduran tobacco.  I like Honduran tobacco.  They say Honduran tobacco is the closest to Cuban tobacco.  I think that's somewhat true of the Cubans I've had.  It reminds me of Honduran tobacco.  It kind of reminds me of that.  They're not exactly the same, but there's a hint of that.  This is a nice cigar.  The wrapper is very nice, very well made.  The draw was very nice when I cut it.  I did do a little work on it with my perfect draw cigar tool just because.  to make sure.  but the draw is very nice it's very earthy it has a very earthy feel to it very earthy flavor too which is nice excuse me uh a little seedery i would say and it's got that je ne sais quoi that some cigars have especially cigars these old type brand cigars like punch and then part of this and some of these cigars have a certain flavor a terroir so to speak that i enjoy.  um i don't know if it's the honduran tobacco on there but it's a certain nice earthy uh mellow flavor a little seedier like i say.  it's very classic tasting cigar.  excuse me that i just put on my nose but it's very classic tasting It's smooth.  You know, I've said before, I'll say it again, that what makes a cigar a good cigar is, first of all, high quality tobacco, which not all cigar companies buy.  the highest quality tobacco because quality tobacco varies from, you know, batch to batch and whoever, grower to grower.  But this obviously has very nice high quality tobacco.  Secondly, the age of the tobacco.  well, and this is obviously very well aged and very nicely done.  The roll has a lot to do with it too as well.  And this has always been rolled very well.  And then they actually age the cigar itself once it's been rolled.  They age the tobacco first, and then they actually put it into a cigar, and then they age those cigars.  And this, again, obviously has been aged a few years.  And that all helps with the smoothness of it and the mellowness of it.  I would say it's probably... Probably a medium as far as being strength goes.  It's not super strong.  Of course, it's not a maduro or anything like that.  I would say it's about a medium as far as flavor goes.  It would be a worthwhile cigar to try if you're a new cigar smoker.  Snork.  It would be a good cigar to give a friend who wants to try a cigar, maybe even for a first cigar though.  It's strong enough and robust enough.  I'm not sure I would recommend it for your first cigar.  I would recommend this after you've been smoking cigars a while and doodling around.  This would be a good cigar to try then.  because it's it's about medium as far as body goes not super strong but it's also not really light.  you really have some flavor there to it a bit of a kick to it and on the tongue you can taste a kind of like almost a whiskey flavor in the senses.  you know how whiskey has that strong flavor and you know of barrel and wood and there's a bit of that wood and cedar in here which is kind of nice.  anyway it's very nice.  I'm enjoying it.  I like punch cigars.  like I said I like these old brand old brand cigars.  Punch is a brand of cigar.  It used to be a Cuban cigar.  Then the communists took over and stole all their land and all their cigar factories.  And so now these owners, they took off with a bag of seeds and hot-footed to the United States or to South America somewhere and opened up a new cigar company, and they just use their same name.  So it's not the Cuban Punch.  It's just been still, it was originally created by people who, you know, who used to own those factories.  Sadly, it got stolen from them by communists.  So a cigar like this, even though it's made probably in Honduras, I didn't look at it before I came out because it was kind of impromptu, it still was from original Cuban seed tobacco.  The wrapper note is nice too.  I recommend you try that when you're smoking a cigar.  Just let the smoke kind of drift up in your nose.  Don't inhale it.  Just let that wrapper not go up in your nose.  That's a whole other part of enjoying a cigar.  Kind of like nosing a whiskey or a good wine.  Maybe medium to full body is what I'd call it.  There's a bit of a fullness there.  It's not aggressive, though.  Anyway, there it is.  The Punch Double Corona regular wrapper.  I'll put what it is down here in the description.  in the uh in the video.  i'm not gonna run the house right now and spoil my evening.  they should.  i'd have forgotten anyway.  if i looked before i came out here i would have forgotten anyway.  probably that's just the truth.  i'm getting old.  the truth is my memory always sucks.  so it's very classic taste very classic tasting cigar.  well that's it folks.  thanks for watching.  hope you enjoyed the first taste.  review what you're going to call this.
