            "text": "Hi, I'm Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute and author of the new book, Love Your Enemies, How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt.  As someone who talks a lot about policy and politics in Washington, I've received my fair share of contempt from strangers.  Want a few examples?  Let's take a look at some of my mentions on Twitter.  Arthur can go eat a plate of hot trash.  Queen, but I'm trying to cut down.  From replacement level, I don't know who Arthur Brooks is, but what an asshole.  A Yale man, I see.  DeLoot says, perhaps someday a physicist will measure the precise amount of nothing in Arthur Brooks' columns and win the Nobel Prize.  That one really hurts.  Ho, ho, ho, it's Brian.  ho ho ho indeed, says, we need a permanent break from the tyranny of people like you.  Ho ho ho, Brian.  Cal Crawford, Arthur Brooks, the very face of evil.  Since the 2016 election, I've been going all over the country asking people how they feel about what's happening in America today.  And here's the truth.  Almost all of us are sick of the culture of contempt.  More than nine in ten Americans can't stand how we're being bullied by the loudest voices on the fringes.  Most people want to fight back.  The problem is, they just don't know how.  That's what Love Your Enemies is all about.  How we can subvert the culture of contempt.  So if you hate the way our culture is going, are ready to stand up to the bullies, and need some practical strategies for how we can disagree better, grab a copy of Love Your Enemies, available for pre-order now.  I'll show you how you can be a healer in your community and become a happier, healthier, and even more successful person in the process.  I promise it won't disappoint.  But if it does, I'm on Twitter, at Arthur Brooks. ",
