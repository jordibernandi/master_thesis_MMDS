            "text": "Hey there!  It's C from transvoicelessons.com.  And today I'm super excited to announce that I am going to be releasing a Patreon, okay?  I played around with this idea for a while and I actually filmed a few different videos and it just didn't feel right.  But now I feel like I have a good idea of how I can do this and why I'll do this.  So my goal with this Patreon is to have a platform to help me support and create more content that I want to make.  I'm making a lot of stuff right now for the trans and gender non-conforming voice communities, and I want to do a lot more of that.  I want to make more music.  I want to make more animation.  I want to paint more.  I want to just speak more, and I just want to communicate more with the people who support me.  And I feel that this is the best possible avenue and platform in order for me to facilitate that, okay?  Now, for those of you who do want to support me, I have all kinds of amazing perks that I'm excited for.  So one, I'll be creating a Patreon only Discord server.  Okay.  This will be a Discord server full of my students and my supporters, and it'll just be an amazing community where we can discuss and sort of progress and communicate.  Two, I'll be offering sort of voice or audio feedback.  You can send me recordings and I can give you feedback in the form of text or an audio file.  So for those of you who don't want to take private lessons, but still want feedback on how their voice is developing or where their voice is at, that would be perfect for you.  Three, I'm going to be having Patreon only live streams.  So I'll be playing piano and different instruments and taking questions and hanging out and demonstrating concepts on private streams for my supporters.  Four, this is super exciting.  I'm gonna offer a limited amount of people the freedom to have a 30 minute discussion with me about anything.  There's a private discussion.  We can discuss politics, religion, and we can discuss philosophy or voice or music or literally anything.  Okay.  So I look forward to that.  You can come and debate me or argue with me or hang out with me or anything.  Okay.  Um, and then lastly, something else I'm very excited for.  I'm going to offer people the ability to have a piece of music composed for them.  Okay.  And of course, lots of other really exciting things that I'm looking forward to.  So this is a really exciting thing for me.  I've never attempted anything like this, but I hope that this can give me the freedom to create more video content for everybody here on YouTube.  And so, yeah, if you just want to support me or you want to be a part of this amazing thing that's starting to happen, feel free to.  And of course, if you feel you can't, that's totally fine too.  I'm just really happy and thankful that I get to be in an opportunity and a place to educate people.  I love doing this so much and I just want to do it more.  So yeah, thank you so much.  And if you have any questions whatsoever, please feel free to leave a comment below.  And if you do want to support me, head on over to my Patreon page.  And thank you so much for everything, honestly.  Bye-bye. ",
