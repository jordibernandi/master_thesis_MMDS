Hey, y'all, a 22-year-old white woman who shot and killed a black man who drove away from the scene of an accident has been denied bond after a dramatic 911 call that she was played in court.  In May, Kenneth Haring hit a truck and initially waited at the scene, but became disoriented and drove off.  Uh, could have been, you know, concussion.  Well, Hannah Payne called 911 claiming Haring was drunk and that she was going to follow him.  punk-ass Georgina Zimmerman.  The dispatcher told her several times not to follow him, like they told George Zimmerman.  Take a listen to the 911 call.  He is drunk.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm sorry.  I can't tell you.  I'm not.  I'm not going to follow him because he is going to cause another accident.  Ma'am!  Yes.  Ma'am!  He just pulled the trigger of my gun in my head.  Ma'am, you are not supposed to follow him.  Harry was believed to be having a medical emergency, and no drugs or alcohol were found in his system, according to toxicology reports.  Okay, first of all, she told your dumb ass, don't follow him.  And then you go, he pulled the trigger on my gun.  The only way, first of all, this man is dead.  He's dead, okay?  She's sitting there.  This is I'm telling you, these white folks have lost their minds with how they're operating.  They lost their minds. ",

Her defense in this case is going to be that she made some.  she made a judgment decision in order to try to protect others.  And so then there was a struggle for the gun.  Whether he was drunk or not doesn't really matter.  It's a real tragedy, but she's going to stay in jail.  But watch for her defense.  It's going to be a very difficult case to prosecute for the local prosecutors. ",

They don't have a fear of law enforcement.  They don't have a fear of of norms or standards.  They don't have a fear of other people.  This woman in particular believed that it was well within her rights and her power to chase down a person.  and pull out a weapon, and now, as Scott said, again, auditioning for the defense, that she's gonna claim that she was concerned about public safety, and someone ended up dead.

When the dispatcher, more than black lawyers at your law firm, this is real simple.  When the dispatcher, right, you walk right into that one.  So I don't know why you wouldn't bring that back up with your five or six black lawyers.  Here's the deal, y'all.  I'm telling y'all right now.  Same thing.  Same thing.  Let me tell y'all right now.  Y'all need to learn how to listen to dispatchers.  And stop.  And see, this is also what happens when y'all folks who want to have guns.  Because here's the real deal.  When you got that gun, you think you really emboldened.  I don't care what anybody says.  You act differently when you don't have a gun.  I believe you act with some common damn sense when you don't have a gun.  When you got a gun, you think, oh, yeah, I'm big and bad.  That's the fundamental problem with all these crazy white folks who are walking around with guns, yelling Second Amendment.  And this brother is dead because she's stupid.  It was a car accident.  A car can get fixed.  A car can get repaired.  This is a life taken.  I hope they send her trifling behind to prison and LaQuisha is her bunkmate for the next 50 to 75 years.  And she got to look at somebody black every day.  I have no sympathy for her at all.  All right, folks, back to that Roller Martin unfiltered video in just one moment.  All right, folks, Roller Martin here.  They are back, the folks with MarijuanaStock.org.  Of course, you might remember just a few months ago, of course, many of you had the opportunity to invest in their last crowdfunding campaign.  It raised a ton of money in just a few months, investing in legal marijuana farms.  now own shares of a publicly traded company.  now they have a new investment opportunity that is as good if not even better than the last one.  i'm talking about industrial hemp cbd.  for those who don't know the hemp plant is the cousins of marijuana with a much higher concentration of cbd which means hemp cbd gives you all the medical benefits of marijuana without getting you high.  Until recently, hemp farming was practically illegal in the U.S.  and heavily regulated by the DEA.  However, the 2018 Farm Bill changed all of that, making it legal to grow hemp CBD in the  U.S.,  creating one of the largest commodities worldwide.  They need land to grow all of the plants, which makes for an incredible investment opportunity.  And that's where our good friends at 420 Real Estate come in.  Their business model, folks, is simple.  They buy land that supports hemp CBD grow operations and lease it to licensed, high-paying tenants.  They are hemp CBD landlords, and you can get in on the action.  You can invest in this crowdfunding campaign for as little as $200 up to $10,000.  All right, for you to invest, go to MarijuanaStock.org.  That's MarijuanaStock.org to get in the game.  I'll be back to your Roland Martin.  I'll be right back. ",
