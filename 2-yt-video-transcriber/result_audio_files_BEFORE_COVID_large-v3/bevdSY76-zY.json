It says that there is a definite history of the multiverse and you can make predictions.  Different multiverse models will have different ratios of ordinary observers to random observers.  That's a good thing.  That helps us distinguish between viable models of the multiverse and non-viable models.  And there are plenty of viable models where the Boltzmann brain or random fluctuations do not dominate.  Furthermore, just as a little preview of coming attractions, I'm trying to write a paper when I'm not debating about God and cosmology.  I'm a physicist, and I'm currently working on a paper that says that actually Boltzmann brains random fluctuations occur much, much less frequently than we previously believed.

Hence our observations suggest that this scenario is incorrect and that perhaps our universe is decaying at an astronomical rate.  Read it!  All of it!  The decay, which Carroll also mentions in his paper, which I assume you didn't read either, refers to the decay of the vacuum state.  Basically, think of our universe as a bubble.  Inside that bubble there is a minimum energy level that we think of as vacuum.  But we know that vacuum contains energy, and the amount of energy in vacuum is a property of the bubble, the universe that is.  Outside the bubble we expect the vacuum state to be different, and at some point that means a quantum tunneling event can cause the bubble to pop.  The bubble popping, that is, the vacuum state decaying, means the end of the universe.  And if that happens within tens or hundreds of billions of years rather than, say, googolplex years, then there is no Boltzmann brain problem, because no Boltzmann brains will have had time to form.  Other cosmologists offer other solutions, some of which don't involve the mother of all mass extinction events.  Suck it, Thanos!  For example, new universes might spawn from the quantum vacuum of the multiverse at a high enough rate that while each one spends almost its entire existence in a state of heat death, populated by Boltzmann brains, the number of ordinary observers in the entire multiverse will always dwarf the number of Boltzmann brains at any given time.
