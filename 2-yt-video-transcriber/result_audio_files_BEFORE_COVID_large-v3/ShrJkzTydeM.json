            "text": "hi guys welcome back to my channel.  so today I am going to be doing a hair tutorial.  I know this is probably not gonna have many views on it.  a lot of people aren't really gonna care about this at all but I keep getting asked over and over in DMS and in comments to do a hair tutorial.  so I'm I hope you're not disappointed by this because it's not going to be very complicated or complex or anything and I'm afraid that for most people this hairstyle might not be as simple as it is for me because I think it has a lot to do with my hair texture that it is so easy for me.  Basically, I mean like this is this is my hair down just kind of like as it is.  It has a lot of natural wave and kind of texture and you can see here like I have a cowlick here I have a cowlick here and throughout the day My hair kind of it ends up kind of more like this and I just it drives me crazy having my hair in my face And so that's why I pin it back.  this this hairstyle that I do it really I I create and create.  I decided to start doing it every day because it's just simple, it's easy, it looks eloquent, and it keeps my hair out of my face.  But I can still keep my hair down.  I don't like really wearing my hair up in a bun unless I'm exercising or I'm having just one of those days where I want to have just my hair off of my face.  Normally I like my hair down, but I don't like it in my face.  So that's... That's what the hairstyles kind of bonus is.  You can still wear your hair down, but it's up out of your face.  You kind of look fresh, has kind of a vintage-y vibe to it.  So my hair texture just before I start, my hair is very fine.  I have very thin strands of hair, but my hair is very thick.  I have a lot of hair.  so there's a lot of volume in my hair naturally especially at the roots like you can see like my hair just goes straight up here.  so this is just what my hair looks like.  uh when it's dried straight like sort of air dried i don't really use the hair dryer.  unless i need to wash my hair i put some oil in it.  um i use a l'oreal extraordinary oil hair oil and then I just let my hair air dry and this is sort of what I'm working with from the beginning.  so to do my hair I use these.  so these are the clips that I use.  if you can see they're like little.  they're metal clips.  their teeth it's like this well the lighting is kind of bad.  they have like little jewels on them which are.  it's quite cute if you can see that.  They're just like gold little teeth clips.  And I find that these are the best type of clip for getting my hair up and keeping it up and keeping it in place.  Sometimes I use bobby pins, but I find that when I use bobby pins, I have to use more to keep it stable at my root, whereas these guys, once they're in, they're in and my hair just stays perfect all day long.  So to do my hairstyle, I take a finger just about an inch above my ear and I always leave a little bit of hair just at like what would be like kind of like my sideburn I guess.  I always leave that down because I like that hair there just to kind of frame the face a little bit more.  So I just take a finger right about an inch above where my ear is and I go straight up to about maybe an inch from where my part is.  Then I hold that piece of hair in place.  and fix any strands which are sticking out.  And as you can see, I don't need to do anything to make that volume.  That's just the texture of my hair.  So if you have flat hair or really thin hair that doesn't have a lot of natural volume in it, at this point, you may want to use a bit of hairspray to keep that volume in place.  And then I literally just clip.  Try and make sure that I'm not getting any of that piece in the clip.  But I just clip it like that.  And then I might just, you know, tug at it a little bit just to give it a little bit more volume.  If I don't like how high up it is, then I'll open the clip up and just pull that hair back.  Make sure it's secure.  And that's it.  That's one side done.  You know, like that's literally it.  And you can see this is what it looks like.  on the side, okay?  Same thing on the other side.  Now, I don't part my hair in the middle.  My hair is kind of a side part, so there will be more hair on this side for me.  You can do this style with a center part if you want, but I just think it looks better on me to have a side part.  So for this side, because there's more hair on this side of my head right now, I will take less hair here than what I will on this side because I want side of my hair that's clipped to be kind of.  even so I'm taking less hair on this side.  same thing again.  you know leaving a little bit of hair down and then pulling that piece up is fixing any loose strands and then I pin it in place and that is literally it.  I pull it out just to give it a little bit more volume And now I'm really lucky I don't need to do hairspray or anything.  Like this is just it.  This is my hairstyle for the rest of the day.  And it just kind of stays that way.  If you don't want this kind of like very volume on top, you can, once your hair clips are clipped in, you can kind of like pull them out a little bit.  And that gives a little bit more of a relaxed look.  You know, it's not so high up on top of the head.  You can have it pinned a little bit further down and that kind of it kind of takes away from the vintage.  you look I feel like a little bit but it just kind of makes it look a little bit more natural.  that's it guys.  that's my hairstyle.  that's how I do my hair.  I hope that for anyone out there who was interested in getting this information you're not disappointed.  I hope that you know this was interesting.  I don't think it was.  If you have any more questions about how I do my hair or anything like that, please feel free to leave them below and I'll do my best to answer them.  But yeah, this is it.  It's really simple.  Good luck with trying the hairstyle for yourself.  I hope it works out for you.  Take care, guys.  Bye. ",
