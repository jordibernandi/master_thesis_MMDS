            "text": "While I was praying, I saw 11 terror groups.  This is something you must please take note of.  I saw 11 terror groups that were coming, were going to emerge, I should say, out of this present group.  Now, ISIS, as you know, is more than just a group, or IS or ISIL, whatever you want to call it.  God's already shared with us the mystery of Nimrod, ISIS and countries like Russia, Syria, Iran, and Turkey, and what is going to happen with them and what is going to happen with his people.  So stick with me and then go to Code Breakers, and you're going to be well-informed today.  But I saw 11 terror groups.  Now, you may say, well, Kim, there are hundreds of them out there.  No, no, no.  I saw 11 terrorist groups emerging from this present time.  This present display of vulgarity and terror and cannibalism and martyrdom that's taking place is coming before God.  And the cry of these people, one of those in the midst of these groups, one of those is a betrayer.  And I spoke about the betrayal within the United States and then also betrayal in this terrorist organization and some of these groups themselves.  This betrayal will reveal very important information that will weaken these groups irreparably.  There will be no repair for them.  In other words, they'll be existing, but they will have absolutely no power.  Now, I'm not saying that there won't be terrorist organizations operating, that there won't be attacks.  I'm saying there's going to be a betrayal.  And when this betrayal happens, these groups are going to be weakened.  Now, it's important that you take the number 11 because And I didn't even think of this when I saw it.  They were emerging from everywhere and one very huge one in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.  Now, it's a little odd because they're not able to exist, but they are.  They don't have to get in through the borders.  They are already here.  I'm not talking about ISIS.  I'm talking about another group of people that are putting on a front that looks good.  but they are there to attack, and they're not going to succeed with another 9-11 attack because God already told us this is not going to happen.  So put your mind at ease.  It's not going to happen on the level that 9-11 took place.  However, it's important for us to realize that this group, not ISIS, that another group, a terrorist organization, is already in the United States of America.  They are planning, they've got stuff together already.  It starts with an R, as in rat, and I know that this will be exposed because of not only the intelligence of the United States, but because of the prayers of the saints, and the prayers of the prophets of the Most High God, and the warriors of God.
