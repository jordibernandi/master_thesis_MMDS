            "text": "The Book of Sirach Chapter 7 Don't do anything.  evil and evil will never overtake you.  Stay away from dishonesty and it will turn away from you.  Don't plant in the furrows of injustice or else you will harvest seven times as much injustice.  Don't seek an important position from Yah or the place of honor from a king.  Don't try to justify your actions in Yah's presence or flaunt your wisdom in front of a king.  Don't try to become a judge.  You may not be strong enough to root out injustice.  You may be swayed by powerful people and damage your own integrity as a result.  Don't commit any crime against the public.  Don't disgrace yourself among the people.  Don't commit a sin twice because you won't go unpunished for even one sin.  Don't say, Yah will take into account the large number of offerings I've made.  The Most High Yah will accept the gifts I offer Him.  Don't become impatient when you pray.  Don't forget to be kind to others.  Don't ridicule a person who is bitter because there is someone who can humble him or raise him to greatness.  Don't make up any lies about your sibling or do the same to a friend.  Refuse to tell lies because they never result in anything good.  Don't talk too much in an assembly of respected leaders.  And when you pray, don't repeat yourself.  Don't resent hard jobs, including farming, which were created by the Most High Elohim.  Don't sin just because everyone else does.  Remember, Elohim won't delay your punishment.  Humble yourself completely because fire and worms are the punishment in store for people who don't worship Yah.  Don't trade a friend for money or a loved one for gold from Othir.  Don't miss the opportunity to marry a woman who is wise and good because her charm is worth more than gold.  Don't abuse servants who do their work faithfully or hired workers who do their best.  Wholeheartedly love sensible servants.  Don't refuse to give them their freedom.  Do you have any livestock?  Look after them.  If they are profitable, keep them.  Do you have any children?  Discipline them and make them obedient from the time they are young.  Do you have any daughters?  Be concerned about their decency.  Don't indulge them.  When you give a daughter in marriage, you've completed a great task.  But give her to a sensible man.  Do you have a good wife?  Don't divorce her.  But don't trust a woman you hate.  Honor your father with all your heart and don't forget about the labor pains your mother had.  Remember that because of your parents you were born.  How can you repay them for everything they've done for you?  Fear YAH with all your soul and deeply respect His priests.  Love your Maker with all your strength and don't forget to take care of His ministers.  Fear YAH, honor His priests.  As you have been commanded Give the priests their portion, the first produce harvested, the offering for guilt, the shoulders from the sacrificial animals, the sacrifice that makes people holy, and the first produce harvested of holy things.  Lend a helping hand to poor people so that your blessing may be complete.  Give generously to everyone alive and pay your respects to those who have died.  Don't avoid those who are crying.  Instead, mourn with those who mourn.  Don't hesitate to visit people who are sick.  After all, you will be loved for doing these things.  In everything you do, remember that your life will come to an end.  By remembering this, you'll never sin. ",
