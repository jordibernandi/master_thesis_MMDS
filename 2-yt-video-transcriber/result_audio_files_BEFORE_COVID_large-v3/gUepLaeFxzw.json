            "text": "Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Back in June of last year, Kanye West told the New York Times that he was learning how to not be on his medication for bipolar disorder.  At the time, he claimed that he had only taken his medication once in the previous week.  In October, during a meeting with Donald Trump, of all people, West apparently told the president that his bipolar must be some kind of misdiagnosis and that his erratic, self-destructive behavior that landed him in the hospital with a psychiatric hold in 2016 was nothing to be concerned about.  west is promoting one of mental health's most frequent and dangerous myths that suffering is necessary for great art and that great artists are creative geniuses with mental disorders and that these illnesses should go untreated so that the public can have the most raw form of the artist's creative output.  Esme Weijun Wang, a novelist with schizoaffective disorder, said of this myth, It may be true that mental illness has given me insights with which to work, creatively speaking, but it's also made me too sick to use that creativity.  The voice in my head that says, die, die, die, is not a voice that encourages putting together a short story.  I think that's what I like the most about Whisper of the Heart, a 1995 film directed by Yoshikumi Kondo and written by Hayao Miyazaki.  It's about a teenage girl named Shizuku who loves to read and write.  She shared her creative works with her friends, meets a boy named Saichi, becomes both envious of and enamored with Saichi's artistic talent with the violin, and eventually decides to become a writer.  She decides to work hard on her high school entrance exams so that she can get into a good school, learn more about writing, and become better at her eventual profession.  It's a movie about having passion for your art and trying to go about it in the best way possible to improve upon your work, accept constructive criticism, learn more, and develop your talent.  That's how most art... happens.  it's sometimes the product of trauma but it's more often the product of hard work imagination education and uses life experiences both bad and good to develop art that feels real and meaningful due to the passion and learned skills of the artist.  the idea that art comes from pain has ancient origins but in modern times the myth has been propagated by coverage of celebrities and by portrayals in popular media.  History is full of creative people who also battled their own personal demons.  Perhaps because of this, and because the image of the tortured artist is so captivating for audiences, movies and television often portray the tortured creative genius character, a spectacular artist with a mental disorder that helps them create provocative art.  the tortured creative genius who lashes out behaves erratically and has wild mood swings all in the name of passion has become a tired trope in popular media.  this image whether produced in the real world or in fiction has created the myth that pain is a necessary ingredient for art.  we love amy whitehouse and kurt cobain and we say that their pain produced their greatest work and though they died young it was somehow worth it for the enjoyment of others as if celebrating a kind of human sacrifice a morbid ceremony in which the only result is a song.  the scientific data surrounding all of this creative genius with a mental disorder stuff is mixed at best.  There is research suggesting that people with bipolar disorder, as well as the healthy siblings of people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, often have creative occupations.  But other experts say that results showing a link between creativity and mental illness are unconvincing.  Such experts point to small sample sizes and a dependence on self-reported biographical data from the subjects.  Even research with large sample sizes is often criticized for failing to set up objective measures of what we consider creativity.  Dr.  Lloyd Setterer, a medical director of New York State Mental Health, explained, There are plenty of geniuses who are not mentally ill, and there are plenty of mentally ill people who aren't geniuses.  Sometimes you have the two combined.  when you have geniuses who have such prominence like philip seymour hoffman or robin williams or john nash they make you think that this is more common than it is.  one in four people annually in this country has a mental illness that impairs their function.  that's pretty common.  The illness is pervasive.  Genius is much more rare.  In fact, let's remove the word genius from the mix.  Most people who work in the creative fields are good at what they do not because of some curse from birth that plagues their minds and forces them into the dark recesses of their souls.  Artists generally become good at what they do through good instruction and hard work, like anything else.  Shizuku is a writer.  She writes lyrics and stories, she gets criticism, some constructive and some not, and later in the film she submits some of her work to an old man who tells her that she has potential but needs refinement.  That's how artists get better.  That's how anyone gets better at anything.  shizuku has problems in her life but they are mostly external and the result of growing up not some dark internal suffering.  when an artist is good at what they do they are deified in the media labelled genius doubly so.  if they die young this creates some circuitous logic.  people think well pain is what makes art good and this artist who died young was obviously in great pain.  so their art too must be great.  therefore this dead artist must be a genius and the more they suffer the better art they give us.  Yikes.  Okay, let's focus on garden variety.  people in creative occupations who may or may not have mental disorders.  See, there still exists a few other problems with the research and the perception of the tortured artist.  One is that anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation may not be linked with a subject's creativity but could be the result of working in the stressful environment of a creative field.  Working in a creative environment can affect mental health and lead to the spreading of the tortured creative genius image.  The creative sectors are riddled with poor conditions, high-pressure environments, long hours, and low wages.  In Whisper of the Heart, this is referenced when Shizuku and her father have a heart-to-heart about the young girl wanting to focus on her writing.  The father says that choosing this path will be more difficult than others.  in addition to all the other problems mentioned shizuku will face unstable employment and a lack of respect among professionals with careers not in the creative fields.  her mother is initially not very encouraging of her decision but more than that people in creative fields will often be told to get a real job.  they will be told that art isn't real and that artists should only make art for free and that artists should not be paid.  imagine if that were true.  imagine if every piece of art you love say your favorite movie had been made by volunteers.  you can't can you because the movie would not exist.  The challenge of the creative fields can cause anxiety.  It is not anxiety that steers people toward art.  The truth is that the vast majority of your favorite television shows and movies were not created by creative geniuses standing on the precipice of the abyss.  It was not pain, suffering, and suicidal ideation that created Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings.  Most of everything you love was not made by someone while slumped in a corner having a panic attack.  It was made through incredible effort, either by people who did not have depression or by people overcoming their depression to make the art.  Not because of the depression.  In Whisper of the Heart, Shizuku has a great passion for reading and writing.  She loves books, and it's her love of books that makes her want to be a writer herself.  An interest in the profession has made her want to join the profession.  It's entirely organic.  It's not the result of the so-called curse of creativity or a mental illness.  Also, if we are being real here, sometimes people join creative fields because they learn they have a good mind for it and they just need to pay the bills.  Labor is not always emotional.  Sometimes it's just labor.  So, in December, Kanye West said that he was off his medication for the past six months.  According to his tweets, he believes that this is in service to making new music.  Among people who deal with mental health issues, it's mostly people who experience mania who complain that their medication robs them of their creativity.  During mania, the disorder creates a natural high and those in creative fields spend hours working on their projects, but productivity alone does not necessarily create anything, well, good.  But during mania, this euphoria tricks the mind into believing the creative output must be amazing.  Those around creative people with mental disorders often enable this behavior, and that leads to a lot of high-profile celebrity deaths.  I'm glad that there is media out there that informs people about the joys of the creative process, but it is surrounded by dangerous nonsense and myths.  More Whisper of the Heart.
