Then why are you telling me that you don't know where the police station is?  Well, you don't need to know who I am to give me directions to the police station, do you?  Yeah, but I'm recording you right now, so I can't stop recording.  What's your name and badge number?  I'm going to fill out one of these complaint forms for you, too.  What is it?  Sound off like you're proud of it.  You don't want to tell me your name and badge number?  Sir, this is a civil rights audit, and you're failing.  You care about civil rights?  You don't give a damn about civil rights, do you, sir?  That's a shame for a brother to not care about civil rights.  Yes, you are.  You're my brother, and I love you, no matter what you say.  You're a disgrace.  Alright, off to the public pretender's office. ",
