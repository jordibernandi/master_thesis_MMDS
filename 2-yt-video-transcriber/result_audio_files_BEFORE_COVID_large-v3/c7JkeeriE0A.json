Strange as it sounds, this was an actual episode of primetime TV that aired in the mid-90s, at a time when many people dismissed drag as a punchline.  This episode helped break down outdated rules about who's supposed to wear what, and that's great.  But it also makes the drag gatekeeping that still happens today all the more frustrating.  All aboard, and welcome to Matt Baume's Culture Cruise, where we take a deep dive on queer milestones in the entertainment we love.  This time, we're looking at RuPaul's appearance on the show In the House, which came at a pivotal moment for TV depictions of drag and gender roles.  A moment almost as pivotal as the one we're living in right now.  Culture Cruise is made possible by everyone who pledges their support on Patreon.  Folks like Jeremy Pond, thanks Jeremy!

In the House was a family sitcom starring LL Cool J as Marion, a retired football player who rents out some rooms in his house to a single mom and her kids.  On the episode Boys to Men to Women, Marion's friend Kevin comes to visit.  And although audiences at the time might not have recognized him out of drag, Kevin is played by RuPaul.  You can tell he's trying to fit in with straight people because he's wearing clothes that don't fit.  The look this season is clothes that don't fit correctly.  Kevin's visiting town after some travel in Europe.  He clearly has something he wants to talk to Marion about, but he's being a little evasive. ",

But the audience is also probably excited to see Rue in full glamazon mode.  Her star was already on the rise when this episode aired.

Namely, that a lot of people had no idea what drag was, thanks to decades of misrepresentation on TV and in movies.  In decades past, if you did see a man wearing a dress, it was likely to be played as a punchline, for example in Some Like It Hot or Tootsie.  The joke, such as it was, was that it was humiliating for a man to stoop so low as to dress like a woman.  Which isn't so much a joke as just misogyny.  And on the rare occasions when you did see actual drag, it was often bizarrely misrepresented.  I don't know who told Murder, She Wrote that this is what a drag show looks like, an upscale lounge where a snooty maitre d in a tux tells you you can't get in without a reservation. ",

People who switched up their gender presentation were often depicted as dangerous, like in Psycho, or desperate, like on Bosom Buddies, or deceitful, like on M.A.S.H.  These characters weren't powerful, and it was seldom their choice to dress as women.  You could argue that the roles were drag, but few of them were queens.  The possible exception of Bugs Bunny.

Things started to change in part because of Ru's prominence in the media, but also because there were a lot of other innovative artists gaining attention.  Folks like Flotilla DeBarge, or Pepper LaBeija, or Lady Bunny, whose Wigstock Festival was the biggest thing in drag through the 80s and 90s.  Divine had appeared in Hairspray just a few years earlier.  Movies like Priscilla and Too Wong Foo showed drag queens as powerful figures.  And Paris is Burning brought ball culture to a much wider audience, first in the documentary itself, and then in talk show appearances for years afterwards.  This was a huge shift from the bosom buddies of the past.  It wasn't just more of the same man-in-a-dress jokes, but real drag artistry by real drag artists.  They weren't the butt of the joke, they were making the jokes.  So that's the context in which Kevin reveals his new career.  But when Marion finds out what's actually going on, he's upset and forces Kevin to defend himself. ",

Marion accepts that Kevin's straight, but he's still not happy.  His discomfort isn't about Kevin's sexuality, just his clothing, his presentation, the way he dresses.  Marion's friends, on the other hand, don't have a problem at all.  You look wonderful.  Bye, Kevin!  Killer shoes!  Again, this response to a man in a dress is something new for television.  Instead of cross-dressing reinforcing gender roles, now we're seeing that drag can actually be a source of personal empowerment. ",

Audiences had picked up a lot of bad representation over the years, so if drag queens wanted to be taken seriously, they had to overcome that stigma and show people what drag actually is.  One sitcom, late night show, and police procedural at a time, Ru showed that breaking gender roles isn't a punchline.  It's empowering.  But it's also a little frustrating to look back at these roles.  Twenty years ago, Ru used her fame to dismantle the old-fashioned rules about how we're allowed to present ourselves.  And that's great.  But more recently, Ru's made negative comments about women doing drag, and about drag performers who are trans.  To the show's credit, Drag Race has more recently included trans women.  But the fact that it was controversial and that it took this long is disappointing, especially in light of episodes like this where Ru takes pride in breaking down TV's outdated rules about gender presentation.  Her reluctance to accept trans performers more recently feels as hypocritical as Marion's refusal to accept his friend.  Fortunately, attitudes about drag and gender don't need any one performer's blessing in order to progress.  Just to give you a sense of how much has changed in the last few decades, take a look at this clip that recently aired on the show Doom Patrol. ",

            "text": "The fact that a superhero show set in the DC Universe felt comfortable giving us a drag hero says a lot about how far TVs come.  Entertainment used to tell us that dressing in drag was shameful and embarrassing.  But a major component of Rue's rise to fame in the 90s was turning that attitude around, and showing the world that expressing yourself authentically isn't shameful.  It's actually a source of personal power.  That might seem self-evident today, but back then it was still pretty revolutionary to go on TV and tell America You're born naked and the rest is drag, you know?  Land ho, we're pulling into port.
