            "text": "Jesus Christ is Lord and one day your knee will bow.  Saints of God this is a very important video due to so many people that were messaging us and asking if we've ever made a video to help them or a loved one overcome drug addiction.  and the reality is we do.  It's called Sorcery the Dopamine God.  what we decided to do was bring the video back to the surface so everybody could know about it.  but when we tried to re-upload it not once but twice both times YouTube blocked the video worldwide.  now watch how the devil is exposing how terrified he is for you to watch this video.  number one all the footage in the documentary that we use.  It's from online.  It's on YouTube already and the footage individually is not blocked.  Number two, we already have the documentary uploaded onto our YouTube channel.  But the problem is a lot of you don't look down into the older videos so you don't know.  So when we started to see so many people asking if we can make a video to help them or a loved one overcome drug addiction, we wanted to re-upload the video to bring it back to the surface.  Now why would Satan block this video?  Saints of God, I'm gonna leave the link in the description box.  You need to watch this video.  If you haven't, you need to watch it.  And if you know someone struggling with drug addiction, give them the link to this video.  I'm telling you, this video, Christ has revealed things hidden in the darkness you're not gonna find online.  What if I told you there is a principality that resides over the drug industry?  What if I told you that when Adam and Eve sinned against God in the garden, something happened to their physical brain and we found out what it is.  Saints, if you want to be delivered, anybody listening to this, if you want to be delivered from drug addiction, if you have a family member that needs to be delivered from drug addiction, you need to watch the entire video and do the prayer at the end.  I just want to give you a parable.  I want you to imagine that our YouTube channel is like the surface of an ocean of knowledge and wisdom from Christ, right?  I want you to imagine that at the surface is all the new videos that get uploaded, okay?  This is where the majority of subscribers stay.  No one ever considers putting on spiritual scuba gear and diving deep down and watching older videos.  I want to read to you Ephesians chapter 3 verse 8.  In Jesus name, it says, unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.  I'm telling you, you need to put your spiritual scuba diving gear on and you need to search through all the videos that we have.  Every video that Christ has allowed us to upload and given us is for an appointed time and season.  There are so many powerful, life-changing messages, but you're so busy on that boat, on the surface of the digital ocean of YouTube, waiting for us to just upload new videos, you're not diving down to where treasure is.  I'm telling you, Jesus Christ has changed our life with the messages that he's given us in this ministry.  And as servants, we want to give it to you.  But you got to dive down and you got to scroll through the videos and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you on what videos to watch.  Get a pen and a paper and write down certain titles that catch your eye, that you can feel in the spirit God wants you to watch.  Don't just wait for the new videos.  I wanted to give you that parable.  Because to find treasure, you have to search for it.  You have to go deep down.  And remember, our YouTube channel is not like a refrigerator where food goes bad after a while.  And you want to not watch a video because it's two or three years old.  Saints, there are messages on here if you haven't seen yet.  Like the ancient God of time travel.  Or the mystery of unlocking Jesus Christ.  Or the law of erosion.  Or the hidden blessing of rejection.  There are so many powerful messages from Jesus Christ.  Because I told you, I'm just a servant.  Lioness is a servant.  We are servants serving you the meal.  But Jesus Christ is the chef of all chefs.  So please, put on your spiritual scuba gear and go search through the videos because if you did, you would know we had a documentary to break the power of drug addiction off of you or any of your loved ones through the power of Christ.  But if you don't go searching, remember, seek and you shall find.  Remember?  So we love you so much and we appreciate all of your love, your prayers, your support, and above everything, standing for Christ and following after Him, denying yourself and carrying your cross.  So please... Click the link in the description box and watch this life-changing documentary and do the prayer at the end with faith.  There's so many messages that we want you to eat at the dinner table.  So I hope to meet you.  In the older messages, meet me at the dinner table.  And of course, we are excited to give you new messages as well.  But we're clearly at war in the digital realm.  YouTube has sent us a message that they're going to be removing certain subscribers due to this or that.  So if you get removed, if you're not getting notifications, if your comments are not showing up, saints of God, this is a real war, okay?  But know this, we love you.  So with that being said, I want you to click the link.  I want you to pray.  And I want you to watch this documentary, Sorcery, The Dopamine God.  The link will be in the description box below this video.  And when you're done watching the video, do the prayer and then send it to as many people as you can.  Why is Satan trying so hard to stop this video from spreading?  You watch it and you tell me. ",
