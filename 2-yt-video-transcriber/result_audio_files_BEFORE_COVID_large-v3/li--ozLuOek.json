            "text": "Hey everybody, today I want to talk to you about the move that several states are making to return to a gold standard.  Now I took some notes and wrote them down because I want to get this correct and I don't want to mess up.  So I will read through my notes and then we'll talk about it a little bit after that.  So here, before we start, is what the Constitution says about the states and this move to gold and silver.  Okay, here's what it states.  No state shall coin money, emit bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver coin as tender in payment of debts.  So, very clearly, what is that saying?  The Constitution says no state can print their own money.  They're not allowed to do that.  Okay, that's a federal thing.  The states cannot print their own money.  However, they can make gold and silver coinage in exchange for payment of debts.  okay they will allow that.  so the states can do business in gold and silver but they cannot print their own money.  okay that's what the constitution says in a nutshell.  okay.  so any of these many of these states and there's several of them are are making this move to return to the gold standard.  And what some of these states have done, now there's several states that are still in legislation about this.  There is legislation that is going through their particular house and Senate for each state.  There's about 13, I think so far, or maybe it's 11 that have already went through this, already done this.  My state, Kansas, is one of them.  But what they're doing is some of these states have already created depositories for gold and silver.  And what they're going to do, some of the states, what they're doing is they will accept your gold and silver, U.S.  minted gold and silver coins.  and you you take your coins to them and they will give you the market value of the coins that day and they will put that money onto a credit card and then you take that credit card and you can go pay your bills with it or do whatever you want to do with it.  it's a way for the states to be able to have uh a gold standard, something behind the state instead of a fiat currency.  So they'll have gold and silver behind the state back in the state financially.  So you take them your gold and silver, they give you a credit card worth the amount of your gold and silver, and then you can go spend that however you see fit, I guess.  Now, some of these states will accept more than just U.S.  minted gold and silver coins.  Some of these states, which the U.S.  minted would be like I've said before, the U.S.  Silver Eagle, it's a troy ounce, it's basically an ounce of silver.  So you have the Silver Eagle, and then of course you have whatever weight in gold coinage that you have, because it comes in varied weights, just like other things.  Now, some of these states will accept bars silver bars like this a five ounce bar here it's relatively thick.  i don't know if you can see that but you know that's a five ounce bar of silver.  um and this you know this is a troy ounce of silver.  but this and this bar these are considered bullion.  this is not minted currency it's silver bullion.  So some of these states are accepting both US minted coins in gold and silver and bullion, which is fantastic.  What else here?  I don't want to forget anything.  All right.  Yes.  Most all of these states, all of the states that have so far passed this completely, and they're currently accepting gold and silver.  Those states have also removed all sales tax and state capital gains tax on gold and silver.  So they're not going to tax your gold and silver.  and you don't have to pay any state capital gains taxes as well.  So they're doing all they can to encourage people to bring their gold and silver to the state.  so the state has something to back them up because the federal dollar is worthless.  And then they give that money to you on a credit card, like I stated.  But many of these states have legislation going as well that has not passed yet, but they're working on enacting this situation of returning to a gold standard for their state.  Okay.  Let's see what else.  So basically, you know, what does this mean?  It's really simple.  All right.  A lot of you told me that know you can't eat gold or silver and you're not stacking silver because you can't eat gold and silver.  and you know on the barter side nobody's going to barter if you're gold and silver which i say to that sorry go soak your head.  people will barter for gold and silver.  and now clearly another advantage to stacking is the fact that states are returning to a gold and silver standard.  So what's that mean to you, especially to those of you who have no gold and silver?  When this dollar crashes, and it will, when it does, and it's worthless, you still have to pay your taxes.  You're still going to have to pay your property taxes.  Because think about it, folks.  We're not talking something like... You know, an EMP where all power's gone, computers are wiped out, everything's toast, right?  Because it got fried from an EMP or something.  We're not talking about that.  We're right now at this point just basically talking about a financial reset or collapse of our dollar.  When that happens, everything else is still running and you're still going to be responsible for paying your taxes.  And you're still going to be able to need to be able to make purchases.  And nobody's going to take your fake paper dollars.  Nobody's going to want them.  So for you that are naysayers and saying, I'm not stacking and that's stupid, you better reconsider strongly that idea of you're not stacking and it's stupid.  Okay, because you can't eat it.  Because no one is going to take your worthless dollars.  There's going to be a period of time.  I don't know what it's going to be.  Nobody knows.  But there's going to be a period of time where that dollar is worthless.  And there's not going to be a new currency out yet.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do when your state says we're not taking it?  You're not paying us in those dollars.  Gold or silver.  That's all we're accepting.  Better think about that because that's what these states have moved to, and I believe there's 11 of them so far.  I didn't mean to, but I closed the tab on my browser.  But there's like 11 states so far, maybe it's 13, that have already enacted this.  They're already accepting gold and silver, bullion.  And some of those states are only accepting gold and silver U.S.  minted coinage.  But the point is, it's gold and silver.  So you guys might want to seriously consider, I'm not giving you financial advice, I'm giving you my opinion.  You might want to consider stacking.  Start purchasing gold and silver.  A lot of you can't afford gold, but just about everybody can afford silver.  You know, I don't know what the current rate is, what the current price is.  I think it's around 15 or $16.  It might be 17.  I don't know.  But the point is that would be a spot price.  But the point is it's affordable.  You know, think about how many times you go to Starbucks and get coffee or you go out to lunch instead of packing a lunch and taking it to work.  or you take the family out for dinner or you want to go to the movies or whatever people make all.
