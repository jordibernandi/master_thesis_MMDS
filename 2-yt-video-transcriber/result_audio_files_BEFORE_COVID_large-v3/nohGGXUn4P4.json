            "text": "What is the War of Gog and Magog?  It's time to unlearn the lies.  Hey, welcome to Unlearn.  My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we unlearn the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  Now let's get started.  After the thousand-year reign, the Bible tells us that Satan will be released for a short time to tempt the nations in a rebellion referred to as the War of Gog and Magog.  However, this mutiny will be put to a swift end with fire from heaven.  Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations, which are in the four corners of the earth.  Notice that Satan tempts the nations to rise against the kingdom.  Those who are part of the first resurrection are in Jerusalem with the king.  They have already been given immortal bodies, and they will not face the second death.  And they are not tempted by Satan.  However, outside the city remain people from among the nations who did not take the mark of the beast.  These people have not yet been given eternal life, but they were allowed to live on earth during the Messianic kingdom.  These are the people Satan goes to tempt in this rebellion.  Yeshua warned that those who do not enter through the narrow gate will be cast out.  and that there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust  out.\".  He wasn't speaking to the godless heathen when he gave this warning.  He was addressing the religious people who thought they would be part of the kingdom.  That's why they're weeping outside the city.  There will be a great number of people who refuse to take the mark of the beast, and they will be allowed to live on earth during the millennial reign, but they will be outside the kingdom.  The Bible warns that many will call him Lord, but will not enter the kingdom.  Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father in heaven.  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and done many wonders in your name?  And then I will declare to them, I never knew you.  Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness.  These people want to be in the kingdom, but they will not have enough oil in their lamps when the Messiah returns.  Yeshua told the following parable to illustrate how some who are waiting for his return will not be prepared to enter the kingdom with him.  Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.  Now five of them were wise and five were foolish.  Those who were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them.  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.  But while the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept.  And at midnight a cry was heard, Behold, the bridegroom is coming.  Go out to meet him.  Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.  And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.  But the wise answered, saying, No, lest there should not be enough for us and you.  But go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.  And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding.  And the door was shut.  Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.  But he answered and said, Assuredly, I say to you, I do not know you.  The foolish virgins were not ready when the bridegroom returned, so they were shut outside of the city.  they had not made preparations and were caught by surprise at his return.  They were kept out of the city, but notice that they were not cast into the fire.  Those who live outside of the city will live under the reign of the king, and he will be king over the earth.  In fact, the nations will go up to Jerusalem to learn God's laws.  Many nations shall come and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob.  He will teach us his ways, and we shall walk in his paths.  For out of Zion the law shall go forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.  The Bible also tells us that the nations outside of Jerusalem will be required to go up to Jerusalem every year to worship the king during the Feast of Tabernacles.  And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the king.  the Lord of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.  This will be a time when all the people on earth will learn the ways of the Lord.  They will hear the law proclaimed from Zion, and they will rejoice before the King during the Feasts.  Holiness will reign, and the earth will be glad.  Those people who are outside of the city will have a thousand years to consider their ways.  Some will repent and make the most of this time, but others will allow their regret to fester into rebellion when Satan is released.  They will have spent the past thousand years outside the kingdom gnashing their teeth, and when Satan offers them an opportunity for revenge, some will join him.  Their end will be swift, and every trace of rebellion will be eradicated from the earth.  Satan will finally be cast into the lake of fire, and the Lord will judge the dead at the great white throne.  Thanks for watching.
