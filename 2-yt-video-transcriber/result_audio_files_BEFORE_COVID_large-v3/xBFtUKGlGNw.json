Because the origins, as far as I can tell, would be the moment someone said they believed in God and someone else said they didn't believe in any gods.  Now, they didn't call them atheists.  The word atheist is a fairly modern word, having not been used until the 18th century, but if you're just talking about lacking a belief or believing gods don't exist, atheism is probably nearly as old as theism itself.  Hell, you might argue it's older, since before the concept of a deity was invented, people didn't believe in that concept, and so they could be accurately described as atheists.  But I'm fine with just using the term to describe someone who has heard the god concept, investigated it, and doesn't believe in it if you want. ",

All right, so no writings by Thales survived, which means we're left with taking the word of other people who wrote about him, such as Aristotle, who credited him with being the, quote, the first person to investigate the basic principles, the question of the originating substances of matter, and therefore as the founder of the school of natural philosophy, end quote.  Thales was interested in many things, but he particularly seemed interested in the first cause and the substance of the universe, which he thought was water.  He also believed the earth was flat and rested on water.  While he does seem to dismiss gods as being the cause of being, he did claim that, \"...all things are full of  gods.\".  And Aristotle wrote, \"...thales too, to judge from what is recorded of his views, seems to suppose that the soul is in a sense the cause of movement, since he says that a stone, magnet or lodestone, has a soul because it causes movement to  iron.\".  However, it's unclear whether Thales meant soul, as in supernatural soul, or merely meant it as a way to describe natural forces or energy, such as the magnetism he was observing.  There's also no evidence that he was an atheist, although it's possible.  The gods don't seem to have played a role in his teachings.  There's also no real evidence that he was very into paganism, as you assert.  Without evidence, I might add. ",

As I said earlier, I'm currently researching the belief in witches, and it's fascinating to see how Christians often took beliefs in pagan gods and goddesses and intertwined them with their own theology and beliefs about Satan.  For example, witches were often said to ride with Diana, who was the pagan goddess of fertility, woodlands, and animals, among other things.  bishop burchard of worms said.  some wicked women turning back to satan and seduced by the illusions and phantasms of demons believe that in the night hours they ride on certain animals with the pagan goddess diana and a countless multitude of women and they cross a great span of the world in the stillness of the dead of night.  As I outlined in my video, Why Demons Matter, the belief in Satan and demons is heavily influenced by pagan religions.  Christian holidays such as Easter have their roots in paganism.  In other words, if you follow the breadcrumbs of Christianity back like you suggest, you'll find paganism. ",
