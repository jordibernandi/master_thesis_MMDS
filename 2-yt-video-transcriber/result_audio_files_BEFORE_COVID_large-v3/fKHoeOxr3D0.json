I could ask an ancient Mesopotamian stable boy, did you know not everyone who wants to have sex actually has sex?  And they say, yes, you dumb fuck.  What are you, from a thousand centuries ago?  And I could ask the same question of somebody from 100,000 BC, in whatever primitive language we could teach each other.  I'd ask them the same question, and they'd say to me, are you a colossal idiot?  Barely 20% of males get their end away at all.  The other 80% of us are relegated to basically wandering around.

To help you out, JC, can I call you JC?  I will give you some cogent examples of what you're talking about.  Here's a quote from a famous anonymous incel on the internet.  \"'I feel that misogyny is an honourable and viable political  act.'.  that the oppressed have a right to class hatred against the class that is oppressing them.  I think this is a clear-cut example of what you call aggrieved entitlement.  It's literally, I hereby give myself license to hate and oppress people.  What's the next one?  Learned helplessness.  Oh boy, my dude, are we ever on the same page.  Check this out.  Even if an individual man can make feminism work for him, it's still a losing game for the rest of the men on the planet.  Choice masculinity also obscures the fact that men don't have a real choice.  We have a very narrow set of predetermined choices within feminism.  Men can choose from a pre-approved palette, but we cannot meaningfully choose liberation.  This is surely exactly what you mean by learned helplessness.  This is someone trying to teach their own kind that they are already helpless.  They have no choice, and through no choice of their own.  Good God, man, you really are talking sense.  What's the next one?  Self-victimization.  Check out this quote.  Not just by an individual incel, but a publicly declared manifesto of their collective intentions.  the history of womankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpation on the part of woman toward man having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over him.  that's quite an unambiguous sentiment that they've declared there to paint all conceivable history and all the conceivable present as the ongoing story of your own gender's merciless victimization.  I mean, woo, lad.  Now that we've seen this much evidence, I mean, these are verbatim quotes said by prominent leaders of the incel community.  That's some red-hot-handed incrimination right there.  I mean, I'm normally quite skeptical, but this is bang to rights.  And for anyone who still hasn't cottoned on to what I'm doing, here you go.  Oops, that was Robin Morgan, a prominent and published feminist.  Wouldn't you know it, that was Anita Sarkeesian, the unimpeachable queen of intersectional feminists.  And again, she's not just some nameless, faceless trickster on the internet.  Millions of people take her dead fucking seriously.  But surely example number three isn't going to blow up in our faces.  Oh shit, JC, those were all women and feminists at that.  Prominent leaders of the feminist movement across more than a century, representing in fine detail those three psychological shortcomings you just outlined.  Aggrieved entitlement, learned helplessness, and self-victimization.  As a matter of fact, you just described the overall syllabus of every gender studies course.  Whatever we have right now is the result of several generations of that slime being drip-fed into our lives.  More on that later.  And more on that now. ",

You know, I've seen so many videos from so many creators giving their tentative advice to what for some reason they call incels.  Saying, here's what your problem is, here's what you should do, etc.  And none of this existed five years ago.  None of this existed any time in history before those five years ago, because there was no such concept as an incel.  Before this threat narrative existed, it was just... Guys who wish they could get laid more.  That was something that didn't require public service announcements.  You just got advice.  From your friends and family.  And maybe some kind of counsellor.  Since you're an individual.  And your case should be approached on an individual basis.  But this appears to have changed now.  If you're a man who wishes he could get laid more.  You're in a group.  A collective.  Whether you like it or not.  A collective being vilified by abundant propaganda.  So now it seems like some kind of emergency.  That we have to try and tell all or most of these under-sexed men.  What is the best advice for them.  And it's impossible.  Because they're all different.  Under-sexed men are no more a collective with significant similarities than people who can't find their car keys in the morning.  there's no universal or even general answer you can give to people who can't find their car keys because they've left them in completely different places for completely different reasons.  you could say try and retrace your steps.  yeah i can't dickhead.  if i could i would have found them by now.  the only other advice you could give is why don't you look everywhere in your house?  have you tried triple checking every square inch of your home like turn over every piece of furniture unscrew every cupboard and every door and shove the whole lot into a corner?  if you still can't find your keys do it all again shove it into a different corner.  maybe maybe maybe you left them outside.  so go outside and explore every square inch of the outside world.  this is all bollocks.  you cannot help these people with general advice.  you can only help them if you know them if you're familiar with their individual habits and preferably if you actually spend any time with them.  My only advice regarding what people are calling incels is you're all suckers for agreeing to adopt the word in the first place.  It is a piece of propaganda.  The concept itself is only making whatever problem already exists much worse.  And for what it's worth, I'm not in favor of using shame as a solution for this problem.  And I'm by no means averse to shaming people for brazenly saying stupid shit.  It's pretty much what I do for a living.  But I don't think shame helps the people who, in all probability, are already very ashamed of themselves.  And I really don't like the idea of shaming people for not having children.  And not just because I believe the only ethically airtight option for preventing overpopulation is to at least refrain from shaming non-breeders for their life choices.  Forget all that.  I'm not even talking about anything environmental.  I mean, in and of itself, shaming people for not having children is tantamount to shaming people into having children.  Think about it.  One day your kid's going to ask you, so why did you decide to have me?  What if you had to answer honestly?  What if you were on some kind of truth drug and had no option but to tell the truth?  For what is already a lot of people, the honest answer would be because we got drunk one night, or because condoms only work 95% of the time, or because the sperm bank wanted unanonymous deposits and I wanted a free music festival ticket.  And if they were to be brutally honest, a quite alarming amount of fathers would simply have to say, I didn't decide to have you, darling.  Your mother did.  Sounds like an unappealing pool of circumstances there, doesn't it?  Well, what about this?  Well, son, I decided to have you because I was ashamed.  That's right, you're the product of negative emotions instilled in me deliberately by my friends and family.  Isn't that sweet?  Isn't that a lovely story?  It's a family tradition we have.  My parents were mocked into having me, their parents were gaslighted into having them, and their parents were emotionally blackmailed into having them.  Goes all the way back.  Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.  Obviously, you're not going to say that.  There is no truth drug involved.  You're just going to make up some bullshit like everyone else.  Well, we weren't sure at first, but then we saw your little face.  All that nauseating Disney bollocks.  It's okay.  Nobody needs to know.  Families always hide stuff from each other.  It's fine.  But if you want to maximize our potential here, if you want your society to have the largest possible proportion of parents... who have children because and only because they want children.  Genuinely, personally and individually.  They weren't pushed, they weren't tricked, they weren't foolish, they weren't selfish.  They just love people, love children and want to raise them.  If that's the kind of parents you want in this world, then how about you go ahead and shut the fuck up?  Leave your broody little hormones at the door and let people be.  The hardest pill to swallow.  Consistency.  Goodbye.  You know what to do. ",
