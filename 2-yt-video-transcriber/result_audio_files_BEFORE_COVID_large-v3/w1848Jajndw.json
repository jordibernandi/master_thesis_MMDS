            "text": "PicksWareRoadDriver.com.  Let's talk silver.  Great article today from John Rubino, Dollar Collapse, about the gold-silver ratio.  I cannot stress enough how rigged the silver market has been for 150 years.  Talk about a coiled spring.  The instant that the manipulation ends, silver goes from $15 to $1,500.  $15,000, take your pick.  The rigging of the gold and silver markets has been the only reason, the only reason the unbacked fiat system has lasted this long.  Normally it's 7 to 10 years.  Once you go off a gold standard, the death of the paper money or the electronic money happens.  Since 1971, we've been off, I mean, it wasn't even a real gold standard.  We've been off the gold standard.  We've been off any kind of standard.  The only reason it has lasted so long, this price suppression, is the invention of computer programs by Alan Greenspan in the 60s and 70s.  That's the only reason.  Otherwise, fiat money would have been done, unbagged fiat money would have been done in 1980.  When Paul Volcker took over, he said, I got to save the dollar and raise interest rates at 20%.  It was all a con.  They had everything under control.  Read the gold commission report.  What it says is, well, we're not going to go back on the gold standard now, but unless we get our budgets under control, unless we get the deficit under control, we're going to have to go back to the gold standard.  What has happened since that day?  massive money creation, massive spending, and they don't even tell you about most of it.  Quadrillions are unlimited.  It's infinity.  It's what Ruta wrote in the sand in the first comic book, Wishes and Rainbows.  Run the system to infinity.  Create as much money as possible.  You tell me what stops the U.S.  government from creating $10 trillion in electronic blips tomorrow and not telling anybody about it.  Normally, what would happen is inflation would kick in.  But if you control the prices of everything through the computers and derivatives on the COMEX, the LBMA, everything, everything, all commodities' prices are controlled and rigged.  Then you can print as much money as you want, and they do.  We are not talking $21 trillion that Catherine Austin Fitz and her group has figured out.  We're talking quadrillions of dollars, unlimited amounts of money.  And they just don't tell people.  China's doing the same thing.  Russia's doing the same thing.  It's a faith game.  And do you really have faith in your government?  Do you really have faith in Steve Mnuchin?  Remember who Steve Mnuchin was.  He was the head of IT for Goldman Sachs, the head of computer market rigging at Goldman Sachs.  That's why he was put at the head of the Treasury, because that continues today under Trump.  Let's talk several words.  Gold-silver ratio, completely out of whack.  Gold is not that important to the powers that be.  They got tons of it, literally millions of tons of gold on planet Earth.  Silver is the exact opposite.  They have to hold silver down or it would destroy the entire system.  So let's look at how much they're holding it down.  This is John Rubino.  If history still matters, silver is poised for a huge move.  It's been a pretty good couple of months for precious metals, but more so for gold and silver.  Both are up, but gold is up more.  And the imbalance that this creates might be one of the major investment themes of the next few years.  The gold-silver ratio, that is, how many ounces of silver it takes to buy an ounce of gold, has bounced all over the place since the 1960s.  That's when we went off a silver-backed currency to a computer-traded silver price.  But whenever it's gotten extremely high, let's say above 80, 80 to 1, silver has outperformed gold sometimes dramatically.  And we're at 93 right now, 92, 93.  This is the no-brainer.  If anybody holds any gold, any gold, go trade it in for 90 ounces of silver immediately, as fast as you can run.  We are just inching up to the all-time highs.  And remember, that's what the riggers do.  They get it so extreme, so extreme.  There's so much blood in the streets that there's no one left in the silver market.  That's where we are now.  So even if gold doesn't go up, which gold has every reason to go up to $5,000 or $10,000, silver will go up 10 times as much as gold, 10 times at least.  If it's freely traded, they will trade one-to-one because there's 6 billion ounces of silver in the world and there's 6 billion ounces of gold.  And I guarantee you silver is much more important on the industrial side than gold is.  And gold is important as a monetary concept, but not as money, obviously.  We'll never go back to a gold standard.  There's no reason to.  And it's bulky and it's failed more times than any other currency in the history of mankind.  Gold has failed more times than any other currency in the history of mankind, obviously, because you always turn back to gold and they always screw it up because people get in the way.  And the supply is not limited.  I mean, even if you don't believe in the obvious conspiracy that I've talked about and written about, you know, gold all over the place, Grey Canyon, Chaka Mountain, Yamashita's gold.  If you don't believe that, that's fine.  But you have to believe you can find gold at the bottom of the sea, on other planets, on asteroids.  Massive amounts of gold.  All over the place.  It is not a fixed supply.  It is not necessarily even in short supply.  Especially if we don't need it.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, 21 million.  Last Bitcoin we'll be buying in 2140.  And there'll still be 21 million Bitcoin.  I'm just saying.  As it's written, the ratio stands at almost 93x, which is not far from its record high.  With precious metals finally breaking out of the five-year siesta and the world getting dramatically scarier, it's not a surprise that safe haven assets are catching a bid.  and would also not be surprised if the current move has legs as central banks resume their easing and geopolitical tensions persist.  Combine a chaotic, easy money world with silver's relative cheapness, and the result is a nice setup for both the metal and the stocks of the companies that mine it.  I don't believe that the stocks, I think they're too valuable.  It's not that I don't think they're valuable.  I think they're too valuable, meaning every single government on planet Earth will nationalize their mines.  If you live in America and you have shares of stock in Mexico, are you kidding me?  Are you serious?  You really think those will pay off?  You don't think Mexico will say, dude, America, you've been abusing us too long.  The system has fallen apart.  Silver is the number one most important asset.  Fiat money has fallen away.  They're not going to give foreigners the silver.  They're going to give it to their people.  It will be nationalized, even in America.  And the Road to Ruta Teacher's Guide, Wishes and Rainbows Teacher's Guide, called the Road to Ruta, talks exactly about that.  Should the government take over the money?  Absolutely.  Why?  Because the people will be hurting.  They won't have any money anymore.  They're not going to give it to some rich, smart guy who invested in a silver mine.  No, not at all.  Not a chance on him.  Not a chance.  If you own mining stocks, you are nuts.  They will all be nationalized for the good of humanity.  And I agree with it, truthfully.  It's going to suck for those of you who are buying into the silver mining company.  But it's your fault.  It's your fault for not analyzing fully what would happen in a crash, a market crash, where fiat money gets destroyed.  And it's the CEOs of these mining companies that have been absolutely... ridiculously idiotic in allowing their number one product to be rigged by these bankers.  They deserve to be drawn out and quartered.  Not that extreme, but close.  I mean, I was a silver investor in mining companies for a long time, and I was screaming and yelling at them, what the hell are you thinking?  How could you let such an obvious thing go on in your industry?  And the problem is they're mostly stupid.  Mostly, not all.  Most of them are just not smart enough to figure this stuff out.  So, they're going to get what they deserve, complete nationalization.  Combine a chaotic, easy money world with silver's relative cheapness and the result is a nice setup for both the metal and the stocks and companies that mine it.  Here's the one month chart for First Majestic Silver, a large primary silver producer.  It's all up 40% while the silver underperforms gold.  Let the metal start to outperform in the context and overall precious metals run and stocks like this will go parabolic.  Absolutely.  Until they know, until they are absolutely 100% nationalized.  In a banking collapse, all gold and silver mines, all mines in general will be nationalized.  And that wealth given to the people of the country.  I'm sorry.  There's no other way out.  Especially, I mean, First Majestic owns mines in different countries.  Yeah, if you're a Mexican citizen, you might have a claim.  These are all third-party claims, many times removed.  You don't want any third-party asset.  You want to hold your asset in your hand.  Cryptos, yes, you can hold cryptos in your hands.  Call the paper wallet.  Here's one right here.  Right there.  That's a Litecoin paper wallet.  I could put $1 million, $10 million, $1 billion in Litecoin right here.  I am holding it.  Physical asset.  Silver, gold.  I always have it within reach.  Right here.  That's a real thing.  This is going to be worth thousands of dollars because the old system is so bad.  They're printing money like it's going out of style.  And right now I can get 90 of these for just one gold out.  90, 93.  That is insane.  So that's where we're headed.  We're headed to a complete destruction.  Now remember, $100, $200 silver will destroy some of the big banks.  I think it's going to happen the opposite way.  I think the banks are going to be destroyed by the derivative situation.  Then silver will be cut free.  So yes, absolutely, I hold silver.  I have one ounce of gold just because it's a good looking ounce.  one silver eagle, I mean one gold eagle, and everything else in silver and cryptos.  Real estate ain't gonna work.  The best thing about real estate is you'll probably get your house if you have a mortgage.  Because your mortgage will be gone when the banks go.  But if the banks go, what will happen to housing prices?  Oh my God.  How many people can buy a house?  They won't have any money to buy houses when the banks go down.  There'll be no loans.  That's how ugly it's going to get in the housing market.  If you're looking at your house as an investment, good luck with that.  The bank's crap.  We saw it in 2008.  We were on the brink of collapse.  And what did the housing prices do?  They dropped by, what, 50%?  That's nothing compared to if there is no bailout.  That would be nothing.  Martin Armstrong has it dropping 90% by 2035.  90% housing prices.  But we'll see.  We'll see how it goes.  Opinions are like something holes.  Everybody's got one and they all stink, right?  Anyway, you want to learn more about silver?  Let's see how many articles.  Let's do a search.  Go to the search function.  You can click search here or just search right here.  Silver at RoadToRua.com.  Search silver.  You want to learn about silver?  Here's 1,080 articles on silver that I've written.  Yeah, I know a little bit about it.  That's crazy.  I didn't even know how many times.  But it's got everything you need to know.  Why, who did it, how they're doing it.  In summary, silver has been suppressed for 150 years.  And there's a huge backlash coming.  A huge boomerang effect.  When you hold that beach ball underwater for 150 years and it is finally let loose, name your price.  Name your price.  And find out where to get it.  If it's held by a third party, gone.  Absolutely gone.  I don't care how trustworthy that third party is.  When the silver moonshot hits, it would destroy many banks.  There would be nobody left holding silver.  I talked to Jeff about this briefly.  He holds some gold and silver at... various places around the world, very trusted places.  Gold money, for example, very trusted place.  Can they survive without the banking system holding together?  No, absolutely not.  What will happen?  Their guards, they've got people guarding the vault.  They'll walk away to save their families.  They'll walk away with your metal to save their family because the whole system is falling.  So it's got to be in your possession, my friends, now especially.  Anyway, that's your update on silver.  Very exciting times.  I will discuss silver in the timeline article that I'm posting today and tomorrow.  It's a two-part video presentation as to when and how.  And that's really the key thing as we approach the time.  This is Bixby at RoadRooter.com.  I'll talk to you later. ",
