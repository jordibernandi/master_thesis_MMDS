In a simplified explanation, warm wet air and cold dry air meet, create atmospheric instability, wind speed increases, and the height of this hot cold mess expands, creating a tunnel of rotating air, while rising air causes this sky pipe to move from a horizontal to vertical orientation.  It's at this point that a tornado can be formed.  Doesn't necessarily happen, which is what makes them hard to predict.  but we do have a good idea where it is likely within a smallish window.  Now I would love to know where exactly they are generating this confluence of weather patterns to sort of maybe make a tornado, and how on earth something so incredibly difficult to do would be in any way useful.  let alone the tornado doing what you want it to, instead of, say, just coming back and messing up all of your shiz.

Ironic, I know.  How many of them think it's not real or about pulling yourself up by the bootstraps?  Because, you know, so many of their friends now don't have depression, conveniently forgetting all the people who discreetly topped themselves over 40 years ago or had the melancholy and ended up in a sanatorium or some other thing that they labeled it other than depression.  No, thankfully, there is a lot more work done to understand these things and less stigma about feeling like absolute crap.  So people can actually get help.  But that means more people are still alive long enough to need that help.  It's actually a good thing, at least if you have one of those pesky loved ones that you want to not die.  I mean, I don't get it, but it seems like it might be pretty important.  But we're just going to ignore that massive societal change because, well, it's a bit inconvenient for you, isn't it?  Hell, you probably didn't even think about it because that would require thinking about anything.  Ever. ",
