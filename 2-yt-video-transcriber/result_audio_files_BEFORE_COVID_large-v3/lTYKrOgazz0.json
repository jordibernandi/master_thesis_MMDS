            "text": "I've been accused of white male privilege about a thousand times since I started debating people online.  This really is an accusation.  I am supposed to respond with a shamed apology.  You see, based on two of my immutable characteristics, I'm assumed to live a life free of struggle, where blessings flow toward me regardless of whether or not I deserve them.  In fact, even if I do deserve them, I still don't deserve them, because I'm a male Caucasian, and my supposed privilege is derived from the historic oppression of less fortunate people.  So let's take a look.  The following is my privileged timeline, my life at a glance, just the bullet points.  I was born in the 50s.  My father worked as a repairman in a typewriter and adding machine factory, and my mother stayed at home raising us kids.  We'd moved around some, but by the time I started remembering my childhood, we lived in San Gabriel, California in a house my parents bought for $18,000.  That was about three years salary for my dad.  There were six and soon seven of us in a three bedroom house.  Neither of my parents had a college degree.  They were scrimping and saving their way toward financial security.  My neighborhood was at about the two-thirds line between poor and middle class.  We butted up against North San Gabriel, and North San Gabriel bordered on the low-end side of San Marino.  That was our version of Beverly Hills.  That was where the rich kids lived, San Marino.  Our house was about a mile from the least prestigious end of that shady hamlet.  I was aware of what privilege meant very early on.  The kids with brand new Schwinn Stingray bikes and clothes nobody had worn before?  Those kids had privilege.  I wasn't one of them.  My first encounters with minority kids were with the children of Mexican immigrants.  The worst of these kids roamed the streets in packs, and I lived in constant fear of them.  Because I was a white kid, I was assumed to have cash on me.  I rarely did because us kids didn't get an allowance.  But still, on a regular basis, five or six Chicano kids would slap me around, empty my pockets, and throw me into whatever shrubs were handy.  This most often happened on the way to the local swimming pool.  I can still smell the dusty oleander and feel the prickly leaves against my skin as I struggled out of that nasty overgrown hedge, just a block from where my dad was working to earn the quarter I'd just been relieved of.  I remember walking home with tears of anger and humiliation on my face, knowing that I would miss all the fun that day because I had once again paid my white privilege toll.  The siege continued until high school where it ended in a minute.  Freshman year, boys locker room, small chubby kid being pushed around by a group of Hispanic kids.  Suddenly, Orlando Brenes, the godlike star of the San Gabriel High School soccer team, stepped around the corner and everybody froze.  He said, hey, Dave's my friend.  You mess with him, you deal with me.  This was addressed to everybody in earshot and apparently had the power of biblical law.  From that moment on, the supposed white privilege that actually made me a target was canceled out and replaced by another more functional sort of privilege.  I was now connected.  I was now protected by the patronage of a minority kid who had earned his authority.  Within the next couple of years, I grew a little bit.  I somehow learned how to be entertaining and funny, and I started hanging out with a group of kids from mostly broken homes called the Vista Village Gang.  I discovered the liberating power of alcohol as well and landed a girlfriend who was not only a year older than me, but lived right at the edge of San Marino.  Compared to me, she was almost infinitely popular.  Her friends grudgingly accepted me.  I had her group on some days and my VVG bros on the other days.  I lost some fights after that, but I was never really alone in the world for the rest of high school.  So I had gang privilege and girlfriend privilege.  I was still kind of miserable, but not in daily peril anymore.  I got a job.  I worked.  I saved my money.  I bought a series of beat up cars and led a standard working class teenager's life.  The high school I went to wasn't very good and I was a lousy student.  It was the early 70s and we had cars and open campus and girls with birth control pills.  It was all pretty distracting.  I squeaked by, but only barely.  I graduated with a 1.8 grade point average a year after my girlfriend had gone off to college.  Obviously, I was not headed for university.  I only recall one conversation with my parents on that issue.  So Dave, you want to go to college?  Nah, I don't think so.  Okay.  That was about it.  Neither of my older siblings had gone, and I wasn't going either.  There wasn't any money for that anyway.  By way of education, what I really had was what I had been given in Catholic primary school.  I had learned to read and write really well.  So, educationally, I had the privilege of a very strict grade school education, as did the Hispanic kids who made up a good portion of the student body at San Gabriel Mission Grammar School.  My own son is in grad school now, thanks to his hard work and the generous scholarships available to him because he is one-quarter Mexican and therefore not white and not privileged.  By the end of my high school years, my mother was running a daycare center out of our house and studying for her real estate license.  My dad had left the adding machines for an executive job with a nonprofit called Junior Achievement.  They'd bought a second house as an income property and were gradually climbing the economic ladder.  And now I was out of school and loose in the world.  The next segment of my life involved drugs and dealing and smuggling and addiction and all sorts of illegal madness.  I'll skip over that now and cover it in future videos.  Suffice it to say that between the ages of 19 and 28, I usually had drugs that other people my age wanted.  And I got some social mileage out of that.  I hung out with some rock stars and other interesting types who never would have paid me the time of day if I wasn't likely to lay out some lines of good coke or a few buds of Hawaiian weed.  I traveled and lived well and was backstage a lot, and that was almost entirely due to the drugs I bought and sold and shared.  I occasionally had sex with women who were way out of my league because they were, in effect, making a sort of trade.  I was sort of a twisted version of an entrepreneur with an equally twisted form of popularity.  And until it all came crashing down on me, I did indeed have a form of privilege.  Again, it had nothing to do with either my race or my gender.  After the crash, I was destroyed emotionally and physically.  I crawled on hands and knees back into the blue collar world.  I started painting houses and slowly conquered my fear of labor.  I live deep inside the working class now, the lower end of the working class.  I passed my days in paint-spattered clothes.  People looked through me like I wasn't there.  The drugs were gone now, and so were the privileges that went along with them.  I had only what I could scrape from the world like so much blistered paint.  If I had any privilege at all in those years, it was very well hidden from me.  But I found a good woman who loved me and we made a couple of children who loved us both.  And bit by bit, I turned into a human being at least partially deserving of that love.  My home life was my privilege, just as it was for my black and Hispanic neighbors on Broadland Avenue in Duarte, California.  At age 30, I took my rudimentary songwriting skills onto a stage at a local open mic, and I found another source of privilege.  Over the next 25 years, I got good at holding an audience with a song and some good stage patter.  I started and ran a number of musical series, and at some point I realized that I had earned some standing in a large creative community.  I now toggled back and forth between two worlds.  Monday through Friday, I was the guy with sanding dust stuck to my skin, working and moving around in anonymity.  No special treatment there.  On the weekends, I was the guy with good songs and a decent voice and gigs to offer my fellow performers.  Privilege of a sort.  And I was a dad, which is a straight up service job with a spoonful of King mixed in.  So some minor amount of special treatment alternating with a major amount of hard grinding work.  Still nothing coming into my white privilege account.  I painted houses for black families, Hispanic families, and of course, white families.  None of them ever paid me for work I didn't do.  Nobody ever came out and said, oh, don't worry about that prep work.  We'll have the black and brown people do that.  I never got any white male privilege bonuses.  But it is probable that I inherited the legacy of the millions of white guys who had dominated the trades up until that point.  I sometimes thought that black guys had a disadvantage there because black contractors were less common and therefore might not be as quickly accepted as competent.  So even if it played out in the humble world of house painting, I have to admit that being a white male did carry some privilege.  It probably made it easier to get the work.  It didn't make it any easier to do the work.  Are there other walks of life where minorities and women have been less present and are therefore less trusted initially?  Yes.  But for the entire length of my working life, there has been an enormous effort made to overcome those stereotypes.  As often as not, women and minorities are sent to the front of the line based on nothing but their color or gender.  So where am I now?  Now I am divorced amicably from that good woman.  My kids are happy and healthy and seem fulfilled in their lives.  I live in a 25-year-old RV that I bought with a chunk of money my siblings and I got when our dad died.  $10,000 that I did not earn in any way other than childhood privation.  I spent every penny of it on the Hobo Dojo, and that has granted me more time off and less stress.  I'm permanently parked.  I'm not roaming the streets.  I make do with a few hundred square feet of room and I'm grateful for it.  I have long since stopped waiting for any sort of privilege beyond that which came from parents who saved their money and forced me to speak proper English.  I fully acknowledge that as an advantage over those with parents who didn't do those things, whatever their color or gender.  Full disclosure, I also have some money in an investment account from the sale of the family home, but I will need that just to survive as my social security payouts will be small and I have no pension coming.  Again, that privilege comes from parents who save their money in order to pass it on.  A black guy with a city job or a female teacher will definitely be in better financial shape after retirement than I will.  Not complaining, nobody's fault but my own.  And now I have you guys, a bunch of people with all the same strengths and weaknesses that I have and who are curious enough about other people to listen when I put my thoughts into words.  I have a low level of YouTube celebrity.  I've been recognized in public a few times, and I've scraped through this wet winter on savings and YouTube earnings.  I'm now enjoying my last few weeks as a poorly paid writer of video essays, and then I'll have to get back onto the ladder and push my beat-up old body through another high season of painting work.  Unless you all buy a t-shirt, of course, or a CD.  Is our modest success on YouTube due to white male privilege?  You could ask Jason about that while he's doing his blue collar job and he'd probably just laugh.  This may be the worst time in history to be a white male.  Can you imagine how far we'd have gone with this if we were a couple of well-spoken black conservatives?  We'd be touring with Candace Owens and having sit downs with Dave Rubin.  Instead, we have some cheap equipment in a garage and do what we can in our spare time.  Couple of white dudes, ho hum.  It's a privilege that you listen to us.  It's also cost us a lot in time, effort, and social censure.  Still, we do appreciate it.  And if it has more to do with our gender or race than I think it does, be sure to tell me about it in the comments.  So what is privilege exactly?  In my view, a privileged person has something that somebody else wants.  Often it's money and connections.  That's the classic country club privilege.  But it may be good looks, talent, ambition, or a winning personality.  If people see what you have and want to be around it, they will offer you whatever opportunities they have to give.  If not, they probably won't.  If you're watching this video, you are most likely alive in a free society at the safest time in all of human history.  So whether you are living in a mansion on a hill or an old motor home under a shade tree, you have more privilege than 99% of the people who ever lived.  You have some talents, you have some handicaps.  You can spend your time complaining about somebody else who seems to have more than you do, or you can figure out what you're good at and get busy making it into something undeniable.  The first option will make you annoying and bitter.  The second option will set you free.  Thanks for watching.
