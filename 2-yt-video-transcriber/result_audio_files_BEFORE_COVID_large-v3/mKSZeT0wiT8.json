            "text": "Wow, man.  I'm telling you, man, even eight years after I was accused of something that never happened, that was never in the same room as the person, even after this person admitted to having lied, I remember being angry because I lost three, four months of my life under this cloud of like, yo, maybe this person's evil.  That's what people were saying about me.  And when it came out that it wasn't true, I was angry after the fact.  I was angry that there was no due process.  I was angry that I wasn't shown any benefit of the doubt.  I was angry at the person for wanting to derail my life for whatever personal reasons that she had.  And so... That never leaves.  Even today, when people bring that kind of stuff up to me, those feelings still well up.  Because if you know your character and you know yourself to be a good person, then it's hard to know that that's being questioned for no other reason than someone said otherwise.  And it makes it feel like everything is fickle.  Like, these people who I thought I could count on, turned out I couldn't count on them at all.  And that's a hard thing to live with.  So I would just tell people to be cautious and to understand that sometimes people have lived through that trauma and don't want to really live it.  Or people have seen their friends go through it and they're like, fuck, I don't want that to me.  So I'm going to avoid this contact.  And that's a real fear that exists.  So the same way I can understand that women are justly afraid when they walk down the street and, you know, it's late at night.  I understand that fear when the dude's walking behind you.  I'm empathetic to that, that you guys, even if they didn't do nothing, you're still afraid.  That same way, when I'm alone with a woman... I understand how that can be misinterpreted.  And now I'm afraid.  Even if it's not the most logical solution, it is still a real fear that I have.  So I will just tell you, just think about that.  Now look, ladies, I'm empathetic to what you guys are going through.  I'm empathetic to the fact that you know what?  It's unfair that you guys aren't going to be able to advance because you don't have those one-on-one experiences or you don't have that access to that mentorship.  But we also have to have an honest relationship about... the dynamic between men and women, how it's perceived, how men are perceived when they have higher power and they have a woman beneath them, and how that can be interpreted and how that can negatively impact men.  If you don't have that conversation, then men are not going to sacrifice themselves or put themselves in vulnerable positions just to be able to help you out.  And it's unfair, but that is the reality.  Because at the end of the day, most of us are about self-preservation.  That is the truth.  So we have to find a way to undo a lot of that social conditioning, undo some of those bad habits, so that we can help women move forward in the workplace and have as much equal opportunity as possible.
