            "text": "Hello and welcome back to redirecting.  I'm about to share a video with you, which is going to be very self explanatory, but it actually provides further proof of what many people are talking about as it relates to our people here in the lands of our captivity.  Now, what I want to say to our people is this.  This is why we must take care of ourselves and that we must trust the Most High.  Because when we put ourselves in the hands of people that are like the man in this video and those that he is speaking about, then we make ourselves very vulnerable in this video.  there are going to be admissions as to what they feel, or should I say how they feel about our people and other groups as well.  And this is not new to me.  I remember years ago, I spoke to a doctor, a female doctor, which happens to be an Israelite.  And she told me directly that She was writing a book with one of her colleagues, which I believe he was from Pakistan.  In the book, they were exposing the medical industry or the medical establishment and talking about the things that they do intentionally to our people.  And as they were writing the book, she received a threat.  And she admitted to me, she said, well, you know what?  The threat that I received, it scared me.  She said because of that, she pulled... plug on publishing the book but she was basically exposing what was happening to our people.  now this was I'd say more than 10 years ago.  okay since then we've seen a lot of people just exposing this that and the other and this was actually a before YouTube, I believe.  Don't quote me on that, but it's been some time ago that I had this conversation with this black female doctor, and she was very troubled by some of the things that she saw.  She talked about how she would see incidents in the hospital where they didn't do all that they could to save a black life.  And it's almost like being in a situation where it kind of reminds me of that blue code of honor that they talk about where they don't rat on one another, you know, on the police force or whatever.  And even with this, with her being a doctor, working around colleagues that are not black, there's a level of fear of speaking out against the system.  That's why being a part of the system can be so tricky, right?  Anyway, I'm going to share this video.  I'm not going to come back with any commentary afterward because, like I said, the conversation, the interview, the interrogation is pretty much self-explanatory.  And it just reveals further the hearts of the people that are running things.  OK, and I just want to make my people aware of these things and not to bog you down with things that are negative or things that are stressful, because on this channel we are redirecting.  But there are certain things that we need to know and understand.  We don't cut ourselves off.  We just process things differently.  And so what I am asking you to do, family, is to.  is learn how to trust the most high, learn how to take care of our bodies so that we don't put ourselves in situations to where we have to be there in the first place.  Now, I know that there are certain situations or cases where you have to go.  I get that.  You're in a car accident, you break a limb, certain things that happen to you, you have to go.  I get that.  I understand that, okay?  What I'm talking about are things that are preventable.  You don't eat right, so you get sick, okay?  Other things that we are doing to our bodies where it causes some type of breakdown in our body or our health.  So what I'm saying is this.  If we take care of ourselves, if we take care of our natural self and our spiritual selves, then we are in a better position to trust the Most High when things come upon us.  Put our lives in His hand because as you will see from this video, you come out no better if you're putting yourselves or your life or the lives of your family members in the hands of people who think like this.  Okay, family, I am going to go ahead and roll the video. ",
