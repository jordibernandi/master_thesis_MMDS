            "text": "Hey, Facebook, what's up?  So listen, since my last transmission, I've had a couple of people come back to me and tell me about this black female police chief that has been forced to resign over in Virginia, right?  So I've had a couple of people tell me, you know, this is the bigger story and what's up with that.  So I'm just going to come on real quick because y'all won't leave me alone.  I appreciate you.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not complaining.  I appreciate that you want to know, um, what I think about it, I guess, cause you told me and that you, um, are sharing information with me.  I think I've seen this story before about this young, um, not young woman, but about sister girl over there in Virginia.  I'm putting this on my other timeline real quick.  And so you guys that are here, um, do the same thing.  Share it with me.  Um, share it on your timeline so others can see what we're talking about.  So, um, I guess the way the story goes is there's a black woman over, um, in Virginia, um, And she is a Portsmouth, Virginia police chief by the name of Tanya Chapman.  And you can Google her.  There was an article in a Raw story with regards to systematic racism that she was complaining about on her department.  And so, listen, we know that racism exists.  We know that it's systemic.  And we know that it is cultural and in some instances is top down.  And when I say top down, I mean police chief down.  And so while she wasn't part of that process, right, she wasn't part of the good old boy situation.  She was trying to do something different.  Listen, when you speak out, when you talk like I do, there's a price to pay.  Now, I'm not sure how much time she had on the department.  It was she had three years as the police chief.  when according to the article in Ross story, and some of you've seen it because you've shared it with me.  So, um, you check it out and read it for yourself, but I'll just say this real quick about that.  Yeah.  They wouldn't have been able to force me to resign.  Uh, it says in the article that, um, She was told if she didn't resign that she would be fired.  And I'm trying to see real quickly who it is that said that to her about firing her.  But it was the city manager over there.  So the city manager, her name is Lydia Pettis Patton.  And she asked, probably very nicely, for her resignation.  And she said that if she didn't sign this pre-written letter that had been drafted, for her in her resignation that the city manager said, then I'll just terminate you.  And it says that she was also offered two months of salary, listen.  two months of salary, that would probably be insulting.  I'm thinking, you're gonna have to give me a whole lot more than that to shut me up and get me out of here.  And so why this police chief resigned is beyond me.  because listen, they can't just fire you unless they have just cause.  They gotta have a reason to fire you.  And so the mere threat of a termination would not have been sufficient for me.  See, that's just... you know, the kind of person that I am.  And as I'm telling you this, I'm not just pulling stuff out of the air, y'all.  I'm going through this right now on the Los Angeles Unified School District because they had tried to shut me up when I was talking about fraud and corruption and abuse and malfeasance that was occurring in the office of the inspector general over at LAUSD being committed by the inspector general and his deputy, Ken Bramlett, and his deputy inspector general, Frank Khabibi, and his supervisor, Jorge Urijo.  Yeah.  When I went to Michelle King, the first black female superintendent of the L.A.  USD and told her you got winged monkeys flying around on the 12th floor, which is where the IG's office is.  Don't you want to come take a look, sister girl?  And they sent me home.  They sent me home with pay for six months while they drummed up some foolishness.  to fire me because I wasn't gonna quit.  They sent me a letter offering me to resign and said, we'll continue to pay you, promise you won't look for work here again, just be very, very quiet, stop blogging about it.  because if you Google Cheryl Dorsey, LAUSD, you'll see all of the writings that I was doing when they were trying to get me to resign.  And I said, I'm not going to do it.  You're going to have to fire me.  And so they did.  And so now we're in the midst of litigation.  See, that's what happens when people fire you and they don't have a real reason to fire you.  because they offered me six months of pay.  Which they were going to give me anyway, because they sent me home while they were trying to drum up charges.  And so I wound up getting that six months of pay.  I didn't shut up.  But what I did do was I got an attorney.  I don't have a lot of coin.  I'm not Jesse Smollett, but I got a good attorney and I'm a damn good investigator.  And so he didn't need to hire one because I was his investigator.  I presented a package to him and all he had to do was put a bow on it.  So why this sister girl decided to buckle to the pressure?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But if they had cause to fire her, then she should have made them fire her.  Shit, if you could name that tune in four notes, then damn it, name that tune, right?  I'm dating myself.  You guys remember that old show that was on TV named that too, right?  See, that's the kind of girl I am.  I'm just not gonna roll over.  And so if this woman, this Chapman lady had been in law enforcement for some years and it sounds like she had, she understands what she's dealing with and she knows the system.  I don't know why she let them break her back.  I don't know why she let them break her back.  And so, because listen, here's the thing you guys, and this is why I wrote my other book, Black and Blue.  Let me just turn to it.  Let me just turn to it and show you my other book that I wrote, Black and Blue, The Creation of a Whistleblower, right?  This book I wrote about LA Unified School District and all that's going on with me and the LA Unified School District.  Now listen, you see my book, right?  But LAUSD, I know you guys follow me on social media.  So yeah, it's not public yet.  You can't get it.  But if you want to read it, LAUSD, because I know you follow me on social media, and for anybody else who's listening, go to my website, www.sgtcheryldorsey.com, and read the first chapter of my autobiography that talks about what happens when people try to force you into resignation.  Because if you go to my website, LAUSD, and everybody else who's listening... If you go to my website, you'll have an opportunity to read that first chapter.  And when you read the first chapter, I'll just show you here in the acknowledgements.  If you read that first chapter, you'll see that I named every supervisor that I worked for.  Everybody up and down the chain of command on the LAUSD, starting with Michelle King.  Rest in peace.  She passed away recently from cancer.  starting with Michelle King, all of the attorneys in the Office of General Counsel, including the General Counsel, David Holmquist, and everybody in HR, because understand folks, HR is not your friend.  They're there for the benefit of that entity.  And so listen, when they came after me, I just sat back and I'm just waiting for my court date, which now has been rescheduled three times.  I have a court date set up now for July 15th of this year.  It was supposed to go to court in September of last year.  Then they told me February 25th of this year.  And now it's July 15th.  So this is what happens when you're like me and when you're this black female police chief over there in Portsmouth, Virginia, when you when you don't just sit still and be quiet, they come after you.  But you've got to be ready for it.  You got to be ready.  You got to hunker down.  You got to roll up your sleeves.  You got to put on your big girl panties and get her done and get her done.  And so I don't know why she resigned.  Because listen, what I was told is that you need to be able to show that you've been harmed.  So understand this, people.  If anybody out there is listening to me and you are going through something with your employer, what I was told by many attorneys before I found the one, Robert Stanford Brown, attorney Robert Stanford Brown, who's representing me in this matter, check him out in LA if you need a good attorney.  What I was told is that you have to show that you've been harmed financially.  And while I had certainly been harmed emotionally, physically, and ultimately financially, I needed them to fire me.  And so there was no way in hell that I was going to quit.  No way.  And so, you know, now that she resigned, I don't know if she can show that she's been harmed.  I don't know.  Hope she'll get a good attorney and hope she's ready to fight.  But, you know, this stuff that she's going through over there on that department is not unique to law enforcement.  You guys, I talk about this all the time.  And so, again, why she resigned.  I don't know.  Um, Elo, you said she's a classmate of yours and I know her well.  She's a woman of high integrity.  We're good friends, childhood, and there's more to this than we know.  Okay.  So, um, clearly, you know, there's some stuff going on, uh, with, uh, this, this, this black female, but y'all listen, if somebody is pressuring you and they telling you they're going to give you an extra, extra feather in your cap, do not fall for the Okie Doke.  Listen, um, There's a rough road to hoe sometimes when you decide to fight.  And you got to be in it to win it.  And you have to understand that it's a marathon and not a sprint, which is what I say all the time, which is why I wrote that book, Black and Blue, The Creation of a Whistleblower, because I had gone through everything that LAUSD was trying to do to me.  I had already gone through that on the LAPD.  And I'm like, really, y'all?  Because LAUSD?  I had been tried by fire on the LAPD and I had successfully sued them on more than one occasion.  So when they came at me on LAUSD, I tried to tell Jorge Urijo, my supervisor, I'm the wrong one, dude.  And I was a supervisor like you.  So I understand exactly what you're trying to do.  But they didn't listen.  And so now, you know, we'll see what happens.  But I feel confident and strong in my case.  And that's why I talk so much mess about it.  And that's why I wrote that book.  And that's why in my acknowledgments, instead of thanking a publisher or an editor or, you know, my good friends, I thank them.  by name, by title, because I wanted you guys to understand if you pick up my book or if you go to my website, sergeantsheraldorsey.com and read that first chapter, you understand I'm not playing with them.  That's why I name them by name.  Just like I talked earlier about the Jesse Smollett thing.  You know, I can say what I say and I can name them because what I'm saying is truthful.  I'm not giving any characterization or editorializing what I'm telling you. ",
