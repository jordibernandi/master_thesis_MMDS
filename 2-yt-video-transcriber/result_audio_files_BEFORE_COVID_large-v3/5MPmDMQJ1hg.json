            "text": "Hey Transtastic, this week's topic is reintroductions.  So for those of you who don't know me, my name is Luke and I am a 22 year old trans guy living in Melbourne.  My family is originally from Adelaide in South Australia, but I grew up in Hong Kong and that's where my family currently live.  So I kind of don't really feel very Australian, but I also don't really feel like I'm from Hong Kong.  I kind of just feel like I'm from nowhere really.  That's just sort of... how that has turned out for me.  As for what I'm doing, I've just recently graduated from my Bachelor of Science.  I majored in Physiology and Developmental Biology.  This year, I'm taking a year off studying.  Next year, I'm going to be doing honors for my Bachelor of Science.  I'm really keen to do it in the field of disorders of sex development, and then hopefully, hopefully, fingers crossed, I'm aiming to get into medicine.  I'm applying for med school.  I'm doing the GAMSAT this year, and hopefully, I'll get into med in 2021.  If I don't, then I don't, and I'll work it out then, but that's in the next couple couple years of my life that I've kind of planned out so far.  I realized I was trans when I was about 14 years old and I started social transitioning when I was probably about 16 or 15.  I was very much still in the closet with my family and since I went to boarding school I was able to kind of almost have two different lives which was definitely very intense.  but it was great that I was able to have that space to kind of be myself and kind of explore my identity without having to worry about the consequences of people not liking it.  Everyone at school kind of already knew that I was either gay or just not straight cis girl.  I had really short hair and I started going by a variation of my birth name.  that was like more gender neutral.  So pretty much everyone knew but it wasn't really official and I wasn't officially out and I wasn't officially transitioning until I was about 17 or 18.  I was on testosterone on October 7th in 2014.  So I just turned 18.  I turned 18 that July.  I legally changed my name around the same time as then.  I came out to my parents for probably I think maybe the third or fourth time.  And once I started testosterone, my experience with my family completely changed.  They used to be quite unsupportive and very confused about my gender.  And they definitely were processing a lot of their own personal feelings about it.  I'm really grateful to say that after I started transitioning medically with testosterone, my parents completely did a 180 and now they're my biggest supporters.  I had my top surgery in July of 2015.  I had periareolar with Dr.  Steve Martin, very, very happy with that.  I had a hysterectomy last year in September of 2018.  I don't know when this video is going up, I'm filming this way in advance, but I will most likely currently be recovering from first stage of radiopharm phalloplasty with Dr.  Gozin in Brisbane, Australia.  If I am not posting in the next couple of weeks, that's probably why I'm still recovering.  Thank you to everyone who's already, you know, given me some kind words and support.  It's been pretty difficult in the lead up to this and I've been pretty stressed about it, but you know, I know that this is the right decision for me and I'm really, really happy that I'm able to have the surgery and also be able to show other people that it's possible.  all really from me.  this video is going to be super super quick.  i'm going to leave you in the very capable hands of everyone else until i can kind of get back on my feet.  i don't know when that will be but hopefully i'm thinking i'll be back probably end of february so i will see you guys.  then if you guys have any questions or anything you want to ask me feel free to leave them down in the comments.  i'm very very keen to be engaged with comments.  i traditionally have been.  i love that aspect of transvestite that sort of community that we're able to kind of build and that I'm able to talk to people and they're able to talk to me and, you know, it's not just me filming videos and then me putting them up.  I like that.  there's sort of that human interaction there.  I really enjoy that about this channel.  But yeah, that's all from me.  I will see you guys when I see you next time.  Bye. ",
