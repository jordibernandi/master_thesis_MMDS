            "text": "What's up everybody, I just wanted to do a quick video about the Epstein picture of him being taken out in the gurney and the fact that it doesn't look like him, it doesn't match up like him.  Now already the speculation is going all over the place and really I don't know what to make of it.  I personally don't think he's dead.  If I had to take a guess, I'd say he was either paid people off to get him out of there, or he was snuck out by the White Hats and sent to Gitmo.  I'm leaning towards that, but really, I don't know.  I don't think there's a way to make a definite case of it, but you know what?  It's got people talking.  Clearly, something stinks about this, and this might be the thing that red pills a lot A lot of people who have been reluctant to take in a lot of these things we've been talking about.  One thing that does worry me is that the Clintons were pictured right away, you know, with smiles on and in good spirits.  But something that gives me hope is that someone took chalk and put XOXO Hillary and Bill in front of his apartment in Manhattan.  So people are becoming aware.  But the reason I'm making this video is to go back to this picture of himself.  on the gurney.  so now if we look at it a little closer here and put it next to a picture of epstein you can see that the ears and the nose are actually different.  but if you put it next to a picture of anthony bourdain you can see that the ears are exactly the same.  you have this upper part here that wise off and you have the low which seen the gurney pitchers pushed up sideways.  but here it is hanging down.  you can see it's the same.  it has this same little ridge at the top.  And then if you line up, you can see the nose has the same hook on it and that their face lines up exactly.  So I believe that this was a fake picture.  I believe this is a picture from when they found Anthony Bourdain, which to me is making me lean now towards him being alive and being removed from this jail.  And honestly, suicide watch.  And he was able to kill himself.  And they say in the cameras malfunction.  Well, now the backtrack alone say, oh, he was taken off suicide watch.  Yeah, right.  high profile inmates who literally just supposedly tried to kill themselves a week or two ago do not get taken off suicide watch first of all and second of all he just did this at the same exact time the camera malfunctioned.  that is so statistically impossible.  you have a better chance of winning a lottery 10 times in a row.  So in my personal opinion, I believe that Jeffrey Epstein was, in fact, removed from this jail, which could be good, could be bad.  But, you know, one thing that I guess is good is that everyone's talking about it now and everyone on all sides.  And my buddy of mine text me before me and him talk a lot about this stuff, saying that people in his job were talking about how they didn't believe this Epstein.  And, you know, so this has reached all corners of the public.  And I think that's good.  I think it's indicative of their whole house of cards is just starting to crumble one by one by one.  So that makes me very optimistic about the future.  Already, this whole movement has made me extremely optimistic about the future.  And again, I just hope you guys are having a great weekend.
