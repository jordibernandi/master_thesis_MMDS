            "text": "The height of the challenge of kidnapping and other kinds of violent crimes on this axis, the Inspector General of Police did personally visited Qatari and consequently lodged the Operation Poor Father.  The Operation Poor Father was conceived as a very strong anti-kidnapping, anti-robbery and anti-banditry operation.  It was fundamentally designed to actually detect, isolate, and decimate all the criminal gangs that have been giving Nigerians sleepless nights on these roads.  Not only that, a few days ago, the IG, in addition, also rolled out a new counter kidnapping strategy.  And what you are seeing today is a culmination of all the hard work by police operatives, particularly from the Special Tactical Squad, the IGP Response Unit, the Spatial Anti-Robbery Squad of Kaduna State Command, backed up by the operatives of the Force Intelligence Unit, the Technical Intelligence Unit based at the Force Headquarters of Abuja, as well as operatives from the Tactical Squads of the Police Mobile Force, the special protection units, the counterterrorism units, and the special forces.  The office of the AIG Zone 7 also provided very strong supervisory and supportive role in the entire operations.  As I speak to you, the recoveries you are seeing today i'd just recover is made by police operatives and the last two weeks we have a total of ninety-three male suspects.  we also recall that tati five eight k forty seven rifles.  we recovered it to to.  of five hundred life ammunition twelve locally made guns, and so many other weapons, including Dane guns, pistols, revolver pistols, and foreign-made pistols.  I will be showing you particularly one of the weapons that was recovered.  And the sight of that weapon will tell you the challenge that we are facing in combating crime in Nigeria.  The sophistication of the weapon will also tell you the desperation of these criminal gangs.  But as it shows you, as it tells you a bit about the desperation of the criminal gang, it will also tell you about our determination to continue to rain very hard on them.  And I want to reassure Nigerians today that our determination, our commitment to bringing an end to the reign of terror in Nigeria remains irrevocable.  The harder they come, the harder they will fall. ",
