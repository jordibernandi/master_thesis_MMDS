So, to someone like me who's more or less living in the real world, these aren't going to immediately jump out at me as historical facts.  Besides, the author of Genesis obviously wasn't there to see any of this, and since we're taking this from the perspective of biblical literalism, he never gives any claims as to how he got this knowledge, nor does he state that it's 100% factually accurate.  I suppose it's written in a matter-of-fact sort of way, but then again, so is the Iliad or the Bhagavad Gita.

When people say that the Earth isn't being held up by pillars, or that there isn't enough water in the hydrosphere to cover the entirety of Earth's surface above the tallest mountain, You get the point.  Look, how do we know that Genesis is literally true?  I mean, I guess Paul claimed that the Old Testament scriptures were inspired by God, but Genesis itself doesn't claim to be, nor does the Torah as a whole, and it doesn't claim to be 100% factually accurate.  It's not exactly written down as a historical document, more of a, you know, creation myth?  Okay, let's say that I'm an outsider looking in.  I don't yet believe that the Bible is 100% literally true and inspired by the big man himself.  How would you convince me that it is?  Where would you start?  Would you start with Paul saying that the Old Testament scriptures were inspired by God?  Well, that wouldn't really work because the Bible being true is what we're trying to prove in the first place, so to back that up by, Bible says, doesn't really work.  And if you were to bring up the argument that the Bible is flawless, Well, David actually does say that in a little bit, so we'll get to that.  If the Bible is inspired by God, we have reason to believe that it's the thoughts, feelings, or intentions that are inspired, and not the exact words themselves.  Not the least of which being that the different books of the Bible really echo the different sentiments that the individual authors would have had, sometimes in a conflicting way.

Why is it impossible for there to be stories, legends, maybe allegories of sorts in the Bible that weren't meant to be taken seriously?  But to prove you wrong, let's look at a specific example, shall we?  One of my favorites is Luke chapter 2 verses 1 and 2, which places the census of Quirinius within the reign of Herod the Great.  But, in reality, the census took place nine years after Herod died.  What's more, Emperor Augustus never ordered a census of the entire Empire of Rome, nor did any census require anybody to go to the homes of distant ancestors, because that would be ridiculous.  This is clearly a 100% incontrovertible fact that the Bible got wrong.  And scholars agree. ",

            "text": "Let me give you a bit of an analogy.  In our Western culture, we typically celebrate Easter and Christmas in part by telling kids about the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus, respectively.  Now, these figures don't exist and aren't meant to be taken seriously, at least not by adults.  But these tales, these stories, these traditions still affect our behavior.  We still set out candy and gifts Easter and Christmas morning.  We also listen to songs and watch TV shows about Santa Claus.  Easter Bunny 2, I suppose.  Or, better yet, to tie this into religion, think about the traditions that Jesus rose from the dead on Easter Sunday and was born on Christmas.  We have no way to verify these dates, and we don't have reason to think that they're accurate, especially with Christmas.  but we still hold to them, and they still affect our behavior, such as Christian churches having special services and ceremonies around these holidays, and, you know, we still decorate our houses with nativity scenes.  These are things which are taught and passed on from generation to generation, without claims of accuracy, merely for tradition.  Ancient religions had a lot more traditions, and legends, and customs, And Judaism is an ancient religion.  Perhaps Genesis and its creation story wasn't meant to be taken literally, but instead meant to be an allegory of sorts to explain certain things like why plants have thorns, why childbirth is difficult, why we humans control other animals as livestock.  and why the Israelites are God's chosen people.  Keep in mind that back in those days, there was no printing press, so it's not like everyone had a hardcover copy of the Torah or could read it in the first place.  Instead, these were tales that were passed on generation to generation by word of mouth.  and eventually somewhere along the way it was written down by the most educated out of the society much in the same way as the iliad the odyssey the navajo creation myth and most if not all hindu buddhist and jain texts.  if i understand correctly These may have been taken literally to some extent, but these are largely traditional allegorical myths.  And they were treated very differently, being told word of mouth, than if everyone has a copy of it written in the exact same wording.  So we're interpreting it today in a very different way because of the way that we see it now.  Again, if I understand correctly. ",

And if death isn't the penalty for sin, then why did Jesus have to come and die a physical death on the cross?  His death would have been meaningless.

Because if the wages of sin is death, and Jesus paid those wages, then why do good, godly, Christian people die?  By that logic, there should still be people alive today from Jesus' generation, because true Christians would be immortal.  There are several ways which we can explain this.  one way being that the wages of sin being death is a more polite way of saying that the wages of sin is hell and that's what jesus paid the toll for.  so christian people don't have to go to hell.  another way of explaining this would be the rapture.  It's a Christian belief that in Armageddon, or the end of the world, godly people will rise from the dead and live in a new heaven, or a new earth, or both, or something like that.  And the people that were ungodly either remain dead, or burn in hell, or both.  I don't know.  And that is what he could mean by the wages of sin being death, because... In Armageddon, Christians will be given new life, but not so much the other folk.
