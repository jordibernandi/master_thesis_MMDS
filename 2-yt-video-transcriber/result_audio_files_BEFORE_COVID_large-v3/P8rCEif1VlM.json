I mean, this is my first time on here, so I'm a little nervous, but yeah, I just wanted to say, for starters, thank you, because I know you've probably heard this a lot before, but you kind of saved me from the whole, I guess you could call it the alt-right rabbit hole kind of thing.  Sure.  It was like in 2016, Trump had just been elected.  I was pretty upset, because I was like, how the fuck did we get this dumbass elected?  Because I'd always been pretty left-leaning, but I was still susceptible to this whole... Like, there was this very... There's, like, a very starting level kind of... Very digestible starting point to this rabbit hole, I guess you could say.  Like, the first one I ever watched, you might have heard of him.  He's called Chris Raygun.  You know, very... Yeah, he's talk shit doing Twitter, hasn't he?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he barely is, too.  Like, it was like... Pretty digestible content.  There wasn't anything disagreeable there.  It was just like, hey, look at this crazy feminist.  And I started to just pull down that rabbit hole.  And I see this... You changed that, because I ended up watching the JonTron debate, and that's the one a lot of people had their minds changed with.  But what really got me was yesterday night seeing the Soph debate.  So I'd actually watched her content back in 2016.  She got popular because it was so funny.  An 11-year-old little girl saying cunt a lot.  And I honestly don't buy that.  she didn't mean what she said in those leaked chat logs.  And I know that.  Oh, yeah. ",

And there's even a log of, like, a post on Twitter of her brother praising the New Zealand terrorist and saying this guy's a hero and all that shit.  So I 100% think that... Her family probably has some pretty alt-right beliefs, if not her older brother as well as her.  And I look at this kid as kind of a tragedy, because it seems like this is what... It seems like this is what happens when you see, like, a really young child raised on, like, I know this is going to sound cringy.  YouTube politics?  Not exactly.  Like, kind of the overly edgy kind of, like, meme culture, I guess you could say.  Like, over the top, like, edgy for the sake of being edgy part.  Like, I have no doubt she dabbled in 4chan.

He never said kill all black people or something.  It's like, well, it's 2019.  No actual neo-Nazi or whatever is going to come out and say, okay, let's kill all the black people.  They're going to dog whistle and say things and, you know.  What is someone supposed to get from a video where he says black people commit the most violence in the United States and white people are going to be a minority in by what was it, 2025, 2050?  I don't know.  Like, what is like a racist person supposed to get from that?  Right.  Like.  I mean, I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, I'll let you get back to it, man.  It's been nice talking to you.  I've been watching you for a year, and I subbed a couple weeks ago, so I do plan to keep it going.  Keep up the good work, man. ",
