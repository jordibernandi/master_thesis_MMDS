As the world was in flames, as millions moved against austerity, poverty, government corruption, from Lebanon to Santiago, through Ecuador and Haiti, and of course ongoing in Catalonia and in France, a Labour frontbencher uh who is a putative leadership contender.  i'm not making that up either don butler the mp for a north london constituency for whom the taxpayer was at one stage paying for a house in north london and the house in south london.  well if you're a london mp you kind of need two houses don't you anyway?  don butler addressing uh an event the other night, declared, and I'm quoting, that 99% of all giraffes are gay.  Which, if true, would have made them, in evolutionary terms, an absolute miracle.  Because lacking access to the kind of IVF facilities that others can avail themselves of, unless they're giraffes, it's remarkable that the species survived so long in such numbers, if 99% of them were gay.  this was answered by a top official in jeremy corbyn's office who is a giraffe expert who knew that jeremy corbyn was employing such talent who basically said in terms that don butler was talking through a hole in her hat.  she had done the numbers wrong she hadn't been accounting Properly, what is it with Labour frontbenchers and numbers?
