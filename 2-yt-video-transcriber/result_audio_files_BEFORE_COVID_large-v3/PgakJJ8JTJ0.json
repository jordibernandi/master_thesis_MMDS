But the audio, definitely you need to hear this interview with the Genova because it really puts things into perspective about what has been going on and what is being hidden from us and also what we might see when the declassification happens because there are some documents I think that are going to come out that we just aren't aware of at this time.  I'm going to play a couple of clips from the end, and I want to point out some of the stuff that he's saying there because very important stuff.  If you're maybe new to the 17th letter of the alphabet, you may never have heard of one of these guys.  And so I really want you to hear what he has to say.  So here we go. ",

It was the four contractors who were working for the FBI, read James Comey, who were unauthorizedly accessing NSA databases.  That's the scandal.  That's what this is about.

It is he who revealed the illegal spying, which started in 2012.  It is he who went to the FISA courts And it is he that John Carlin, Ash Carter, and James Clapper tried to get fired for going to the court.  I would put Mike Rogers in the grand jury first as a friendly witness. ",

            "text": "So if you've been with me for a while you probably have seen my videos on Mike Rogers and not only that but there's also the one on the illegal queries because this is the keystone of it.  Mike Rogers who was the head of the NSA at the time discovered what was going on with these illegal queries happening and they were not being done legally.  It was all illegally done by contractors not even by the people that were supposed to be doing them.  And so this is what was happening with all this material.  that's in the NSA database.  And yeah, you know, the NSA database is huge because they have that new facility out there in Utah.  And, you know, they have everything, okay?  The NSA really does have everything.  You know, I know a couple of people have mentioned that they think the lawyers and everything that were part of Mueller's team were really destroying evidence.  Well, you know, it's not going to matter because the NSA already has copies of it.  They've got everything, folks.  They really do.  Anyway, what he's saying here about Rogers is so important because Rogers is a keystone of this.  He really is.  He's the person who knows what was going on.  And, you know, he was not only the head of the NSA, he was also head of U.S.  Cyber Command.  Both of them at the same time.  That's why he was such a threatening person and they needed to try to get rid of him.  The problem was they waited until after the election.  Well, the election didn't go the way they wanted it to.  So then they went into a panic and all of a sudden it was like, we got to get rid of Rogers.  He's going to get us all in trouble.  He's going to put all this out there and Trump is going to listen to him and we're going to be in trouble.  So that's why they all of a sudden decided we need to get rid of Rogers.  And they trumped up a bunch of charges.  And this John Carlin was one of the people that was behind that move to try to get rid of Rogers.  Let me play the rest of the clip here. ",

Nobody's ever heard the name, but he is the person who tried to get Mike Rogers fired for being honest with the court.  And John Carlin is also the person who filed, just before he resigned from the Justice Department, a false certification to defy the court that they were obeying the rules, when in fact they weren't.  And when Judge Collier issued her opinion, she accused John Carlin of what she called an institutional lack of candor.  In other words, he lied to her.  Wow. ",

            "text": "Now, for those who have been following that 17th letter of the alphabet, you know who John Carlin is.  You've heard of him.  And that's why he was so important that the 17th letter of the alphabet had to mention him, because he was the person that tried to get rid of Rogers.  And all of this went on during that transitional time between the election and the inauguration.  Yep, lots of things were happening right then and I can't help but wonder if the reason Rogers retired back in June of last year, I think maybe he did it so he could testify.  You know, I could be wrong on that.  Maybe he could testify anyway, but maybe there's like a different freedom that when he is not, you know, in that position that he's able to say some things that maybe he wouldn't have been able to say had he still been in that position.  Plus, you know, the guy's getting to the point where he probably wanted to retire.  He's done an awful lot for our country.  But I think he's still at work doing things for our country right now.  So I wanted to point this out to you.  And like I said, the rest of this, very good stuff.  Because this sets the stage, I think, for what's going to be coming out.  And if you notice, a lot of these things that they're talking about happened back in 2012.  So it wasn't just for the 2016 Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump election.  This was way back in 2012.  So Obama was weaponizing his intelligence community back then.  I mean, it's been happening for years and it needed to stop.  and now it needs to be exposed so everyone knows what they did.  It cannot be allowed to continue like this.  We have to have it stopped and it needs to be stopped now.  So that's what's going to be happening I think when all this declassification happens.  Now he also says at the beginning that he believes that Christopher Wray and Gina Haspel are currently preventing the declassification from happening.  Now, I'm not sure about that, but I do think that because Trump set it up the way he did with Barr, that he gave him the authority, I think that he can bypass them because it was set up to bypass Coats' office because Coats, as the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, has been blockading a lot of things, too.  And I do think Christopher Wray is a decent guy, but I really think he wants to protect the reputation of the FBI.  And I'm not sure that he's too thrilled about exposing things that are going to really show the upper levels of the FBI for what they were and how they became so political and were used to target people.  So I hope that his goodness outweighs that.  But again, like I said, I really think that Barr has the ability now to bypass them both.  And Gina Haspel is kind of in the same vein.  You know, both Ray and Haspel have been career people in those organizations pretty much.  So it's probably going to be difficult for them to allow the reputations of these organizations to be pretty much destroyed by what's going to come out.  But it has to be.  You know, we need the light, darkness to light.  The light needs to come out and expose all of this because the swamp has to be drained.  We cannot continue on the way we are.  We have no country.  We have no control over our country as long as the swamp's in charge.  So yes, the swamp is being drained.  I think DeGenova here, I don't know who his sources are, but I do know that he's been involved in things for quite a while in Washington.  So I would think that he's got some highly placed friends that are helping him out, and especially in the Department of Justice.  He may even be good friends with Barr, so he may know something from that.  I don't know exactly, but I do think that he's been spot on so far, so I think he's a reliable source.  So I wanted to tell you about this.  The link is down below in the description.  If you can't find the description, it's usually a little triangle or maybe an arrow or some dots or something that you have to click if you're on a cell phone or a tablet or something, and it'll drop down a box that has all the information about the video, and it will have the link down there so that you can go to that and watch this video.  Or you can just put in DeGeneva on Trump's order to declassify 2016 surveillance docs, and that's with Conservative Citizen.  I mean, this really is an excellent interview.  It's 14 minutes long, but wow, well worth hearing.  So I wanted to let you know about that, and I want to thank you for stopping by, and I'll see you all later. ",
