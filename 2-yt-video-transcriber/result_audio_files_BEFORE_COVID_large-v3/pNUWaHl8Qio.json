Contests in ancient Greece determined the best plays, showing the individual stamp of the playwright.  We later see that same one-upsmanship among painters to perfect light, shade, and perspective.  What of our musical forms spreading across Europe, the orchestra and all of its instruments, the system of musical notation, sonatas, symphonies, operas.  We hear a searching and longing in the various types of our music and that vastness of space in orchestral scores, the love of the wandering troubadour, even the large and domineering sonics of the amplified electric guitar and sprawling electronic tones of our more contemporary music.

From the Italian Galileo to the Polish and Prussian Copernicus, these ideas then being picked up and debated across Europe, to the Dane Tycho Brahe in his study of comets, the German Kepler building on Brahe, and also the englishman william gilbert.  these ideas then fused with the dutchman christian huygens centrifugal force the french descartes algebraic geometry and so on.  A sense of independence and freedom runs throughout our history.  What we find in our people is that, rather than state-sanctioned, top-down mandates directing scientific and artistic life, the Westerners more often had independent spaces of inquiry.  Guilds, universities, laboratories, artistic circles, who sought to dare and create and explore. ",

In Old Norse, loge, referring to past deed laid down in layers.  We even find in Old Germanic society all free men and women, who comprise the majority of the society, being equal under the law.  After centuries, the above examples influenced the English common law, European parliaments, and the US Bill of Rights and separation of powers.  Were these just good ideas, or perhaps a natural fit, an instinct?  Can such notions sometimes get out of hand?  Are they, like anything, susceptible to corruptions and confusions?  Can they be skewed when confronted with outside ideas and unusual circumstances?  Of course, but the fact is that examples of our sensibilities and the way we create our environments can be found in varying eras.  We are not defined by just one turn of events in history. ",

But shall we just say here, history is not just a question of invention, and not just a question of influence, because everyone is influenced by what they learn or observe from others.  It's what you do with skills or information that bears your mark.  To quote David Landers, Europeans did not invent the heavy plough, but they did improve and adapt it.  They did not invent the horse collar and the horseshoe, but they did improve it to create a new style of warfare.  They did not invent water-mills, but they did improve upon new accessory devices. ",
