            "text": "My question would be, why is the Bible not enough?  And for so many people today who want to hear the voice of God in some still small voice, I think of Jesus Calling written by Sarah Young.  She actually says in the introduction to her book, she says, I knew that God communicated with me through the Bible, but I yearned for more.  and you see the bible just was not enough for sarah young and for the vast majority of professing christians today it's not enough for them either.  they need something more.  and whenever i hear that my question is this have you mastered the bible from cover to cover?  have you squeezed every drop of truth there is to be squeezed from genesis 1 1 to revelation 22 21?  you have mastered it.  there's nothing else that you can glean from the pages of Scripture.  If the answer to that question is no, and it is, because none of us have done that, we could all spend a thousand lifetimes studying the Word of God and just barely scratch the surface of it.  So if the answer to that question is no, then please don't tell me that the Bible's not enough.  Please don't tell me you need something more.  You don't even understand what you have in black and white right in front of you. ",
