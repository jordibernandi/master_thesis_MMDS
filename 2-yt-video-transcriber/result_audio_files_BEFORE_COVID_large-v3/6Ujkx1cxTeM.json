And I only say this because I did a show a while back for really rich people, and as soon as I walked in the room with a backpack on, they just knew I wasn't one of them.  It's like they could feel the poverty and the student loan debt emanating from my body, you know?  They're like, what is this peasant doing here?  Let's get rid of her, right?  So the show starts, the host says my name.  People clap to be polite, okay?  Then I walk out on stage, people start clapping even more.  And I'm thinking, wait a minute, all right?  I'm no celebrity, okay?  So I grab the microphone and I'm like, Guys, I am not Malala.  Do you understand?  Nobel Peace Prize-winning activist Malala isn't just telling jokes as her new side hustle.  That's not what's happening here.  I like this joke because it really divides the audience.  because it lets me know who reads and who doesn't.
