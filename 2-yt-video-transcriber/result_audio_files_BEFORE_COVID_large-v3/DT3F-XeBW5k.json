He was so irate at how I let him hang himself and then pointed out him hanging himself.  You can see it, it's all over his face.  You can kind of see it in this video, but part two is the bad part.  And the other part of this is, I need help from y'all, okay?  If y'all want part two, let me get 1500 likes.  And 1,000 comments.  Just so I can see that y'all are active.  Because I got a lot of y'all on here, okay?  And I know I don't post often.  And I kind of miss out.  And I understand that.  Let me get 1,500 likes and 1,000 comments.  And I'll post part two.  Part two is what you don't want to miss.  I try to take selfies with him.  I try to stand beside him.  We even do a little dance side by side.  Because he tries his best to run away from me.  And I won't let him go nowhere.  It's hilarious.  But that's in part two.  This is part one here.  If you want part two, give me 1,500 likes.  and a thousand comments and i'll post part two.  i'm gonna let y'all get in this video here.  you don't want to miss this.  this guy.  we had fun with this guy.  i'm out here.  i love you.
