So in essence, it's like this stuff seems to be allowed in a way because in itself it's hypocritical and it's corrupt and it's fake anyway.  So anything to do with religious pride and anything to do with that is kind of fake anyway.  The whole thing is like a facade.  And this is a lesson that I feel I've been learning in recent weeks and months.  is that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.  Jesus is the truth.  Anything to do with a facade or a projection of some kind of false image is not the truth.  And so you see this in many different areas of Christianity.  You see this whole, you know, trying to act fake in order to project a certain image.  And I've been guilty of that before.  We see that across many different denominations.  You know, people thinking that they have to, well, sometimes we think we have to put on a show for God in order to appear pure.  But deep down in our heart, we know we're not pure, but we're putting on this sort of facade, this character role play in order to win God's approval in our own minds.  And I've been guilty of that.  I've seen that in myself.  just not being entirely honest in my heart before the Lord, even though he can see everything.  He can see the deepest murmurs in our heart.  He can see the secret places that we think that only we have access to.  But remember, we are naked before God.  Are we dying?  What is it to die? ",

            "text": "And I think from what I've experienced and from my own walk, I think that part of maturing in Christ is to begin to stop playing that facade before him and to literally allow ourselves to be laid bare.  laid bare confessing everything laid bare before him in seek in you know in a private place in prayer.  um it doesn't mean you have to go around telling everyone everything about your deepest struggles for an accountability partner.  we need to make sure we trust the person.  that person is really in christ.  um but yeah just before god is is being honest just just being open opening our heart to him and and saying lord search me and and know my ways know me lord.  um Please, if there's any offensive way in me, please show that to me and please change me from deep within.  And certainly dropping that facade, whether that facade comes from tradition, whether it comes from pride, Wherever that barrier comes from, wherever that fake acting stuff comes from, which I think a lot of us do in this world, maybe sometimes to protect ourselves because we've been hurt and damaged.  And I understand that life can be very difficult.  So we put up this guard and that guard is sometimes good in this world.  But before God, we need to trust him enough to explore us, to allow him to explore our hearts and convict us and show us his ways and what is not of him.  Because that trust and that bond in that living relationship with the Lord is the way we begin to grow and really mature and become stronger.  Because our personality and our character and our life is no longer... being built on a flimsy foundation of sand, on what this world thinks, our foundation is being built on the solid rock, which is Jesus Christ.  Because we have that intimacy with him, because we have that bond, that trust.  And so when you get certain areas of Christianity which says, well, you must do this, that and the other, make sure you follow this list of however many rules, or make sure you act in this manner in order to win God's approval.  That isn't a way, in my experience, to proper obedience.  Proper obedience seems to come more from, as Jesus said, to yield in him, to dwell in him.  I'm the vine, you are the branches.  If you dwell in me, you will produce much fruit.  So it really is this living relationship of like a marriage of reverence for him as our husband and just dwelling and yielding to his love in order that we might then be transformed by his power into more and more Christ-like character.  And that is the way to grow.  That is the way that the old dead stuff is pruned off in our lives.  And as he says, it's the sick that need a doctor.  So we really are in a desperate situation in this world and we really do need a doctor.  We're all broken in different ways.  We've all got addictions, perhaps, or bad habits, sinful behaviours.  wounds which cause us to treat people in a bad way.  um all of these different things that you know.  we really do need god and his spirit in us to begin to change us from the inside out.  and what an amazing living gospel that is of his grace that he would love us so much to be so tender in dealing with us.  You've got an almighty God here, an almighty God above all things with all power, the King of the universe who created all things and reigns over everything.  And yet he deals so tenderly with our hearts like a lion and a lamb.  Almighty.  deserving of all reverence.  yet individually for those who would believe and follow to trust in the Lord and ask him to change their lives and save them by his blood that these people who have become his children by being born again that he deals with them as children and tenderly changes their hearts from within and deals in such a personal way It's just amazing.  So what is this all about?  It's about being real, about being honest, about dwelling in the truth.  and his spirit and truth go hand in hand.  You can't have one without the other.  So let's drop the charade.  and this religious idea of performance-based grace because his gift of justification through grace and faith alone, that is nothing to do with our performance.  That is just purely to do with him reaching down to a wretch like us and giving us a gift.  you. ",
