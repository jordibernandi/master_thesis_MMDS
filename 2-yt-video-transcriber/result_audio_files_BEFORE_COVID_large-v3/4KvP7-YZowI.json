Campaign funds are not dark money.  They are totally disclosed, so they are not dark money.  It is worth noting, by the way, that earlier it was mentioned that dark money constituted about $1.7 billion.  I believe that figure is incorrect by a factor of about 500 percent.  Dark money constitutes about 2 to 4 percent of the total spending in U.S.  elections and has always been involved in U.S.  elections.  So those are just a couple of points.  And I did kind of chuckle at the question, is it possible, asked of us, that this money is influencing the questioning here.  To that, I'd say that's something you have to ask yourselves if you're being influenced and see what you think.  If you are, you might question yourselves.

If you look at what the majority wrote, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary measures to address an extraordinary problem.  In the face of unremitting and ingenious defiance of citizens' constitutionally protected right to vote, Section 5 was necessary to give effect to the 15th Amendment in particular regions of the country.  This is South Carolina v. Katzenbach.  And today, this is now Justice Thomas writing in a concurrence, today our nation has changed.

Charges of radicalism, accusations of motives of partisanship, but never a peep or outrage about partisan gerrymandering, which has benefited your party for decades.  That is really convenient and rich and hypocritical.  H.R.  1 has been described as a wish list by the Democrats.  Well, you've got us there.  A wish list for an inclusive, expanded democracy and electorate.  Characterizations of H.R.  1 is a power grab.  You got us again, guilty.  We wouldn't have to grab back the power for the people if through policy you weren't complicit in or perpetuating the disenfranchisement and marginalization of the people and disproportionately people of color and disproportionately black people.  Representative John Lewis reminds us that if your vote didn't matter, they wouldn't work so hard to take it from you.  This is the House of Representatives.  We are sent here as representatives of our districts and a greater democracy.  And at the core of democracy and the root word of demos is to engage more voices.  to engage more voices and to empower them in this democracy.  I am really at a loss for words.  I am embarrassed and hurt by the dog whistles, by the vitriol and the venom in this space, and the smugness.  It is stunning and unconscionable.  disappointment and outrage about a federal holiday for election day, early voting and mail-in voting, the rights of formerly incarcerated restored.  According to the sentencing project, 6.1 million Americans have lost their right to vote due to felony disenfranchisement laws, laws that disproportionately impact communities of color.  Miss Flynn, the United States ranks 26 among the lowest of all established democracies around the world in voter turnout.  Certainly belies characterizations of American exceptionalism.  Could you speak to The passage of HR1 and the establishment of a federal voting holiday, how this would help to broaden turnout, particularly for voters who have historically been disenfranchised.  Could you also speak to how many developed countries follow this practice and how it has impacted their turnout? ",

And we saw long lines in states across the country.  We had machines that were breaking down or switching votes.  We had machines that did not work and so people had long lines.  People cannot afford, many people cannot afford to wait in line for three, four, five hours at a polling place.  Many have to get back to work.  So a federal holiday would make a big difference. ",

Mr.  Amin, in your written testimony, you discussed the crisis of the rampant revolving door where ranking officials commonly enter cushy jobs for the very contractors they were charged with overseeing on behalf of taxpayers.  Last year, your organization issued an investigative report that Tracy Valero, a former senior official for ICE, less than three months after leaving government service, she was hired by the GEO group.  ICE's largest single private prison and detention center, which brought in more than $327 million in the last year alone.  She even served as an expert witness for the company in a lawsuit that alleged violations of minimum wage laws and other inhumane treatment of immigrant detainees.  Mr.  Amy, in your expert opinion, is it ethical for a senior government contracting office to go work for the very entity she was overseeing just months before? ",

HR1 would move a lot of those to two years, I think, which would be beneficial.  And there's even disagreement in our community whether one year or two, you know, what is the appropriate time to kind of cool off so that your contacts aren't there.  But this is also something that President Trump brought up.  When he was a candidate, he talked about, I think it was Boeing at the time, but he went on record saying that people who give contracts should never be able to work for that defense contractor.  This isn't a bipartisan, this is a bipartisan issue.  This is something we can resolve.  The laws are already on the books.  We just need some extensions and some tweaking of those to improve them and allow people to cool off and not be able to provide a competitive advantage to their new employer or favor them as they're in office and they're walking out the door.
