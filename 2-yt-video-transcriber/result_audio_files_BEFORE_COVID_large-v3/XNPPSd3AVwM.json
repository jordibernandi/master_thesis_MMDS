And this is the idea of a mantra phrase.  Okay.  So what I have found useful in my few years of practicing this is that if you use a very short, simple phrase or group of words, it can help you practice your voice in a lot of different ways.  So my phrase is eat from fire, fire from heat, right?  And I've probably said that phrase over 15, 20, 30,000 times at this point, okay?  And there's a few key uses for this.  Essentially, when you're reading a bigger passage to practice your voice, like the rainbow passage, there are so many micro movements that are occurring that you cannot control for all the variables.  It makes it very difficult to actually test and modify your voice in real time, okay?  This, however, has a very few set of relationships that are occurring that you can get really good at and then work on transferring to other parts of your voice.  Additionally, a mantra phrase allows you to sort of get your voice dialed in or tuned before you use it, right?  So like if I'm about to go talk or something and I'm worried, I can say heat from fire, fire from heat, right?  And then I can try and like swing into my other voice, right?  And I can just continue that sound.  This is something that a lot of people find really useful if they're trying to practice online like video games and stuff like that, right?  To have a little mantra phrase, say it before you push to talk, push to talk and talk, you know?  So I have a few different mantra phrases that I like and I'll offer them to you if you'd like to use them.  So one, fear doth love, love doth fear.  Two, heat from fire, fire from heat.  Three, never have I ever.  Four, pee, pit, pet, pat, part.  Okay, and these are awesome because not only do they let you feminize your voice and start to anchor the correct sensation to a sort of phrase, but it also lets you sort of play with other modifications if you want, like .

            "text": "Here are a few uses of a mantra phrase.  One, it serves as a consistent ruler to measure your progress against.  So you can record files, right?  And over the course of weeks and so forth, you can always compare it to a consistent thing.  Two, it uses a limited amount of sounds.  Like I described before, if you're using big paragraphs, there's too many things going on.  So this allows you to sort of focus more microscopically.  Three, it anchors muscle memory to the phrase, which makes it ideal so the voice can be recalled effortlessly.  Four, it can alleviate worries about sounding bad by having like a safe word, like a safety net.  So, you know, if you're about to talk on a video game or in a discord call, you can just test with your phrase and then continue, right?  Five, it's not overwhelming like paragraphs or improvised speeches.  So it really allows you to think about what you're doing over and over. ",
