            "text": "I wanted to get into Devin Nunes to use Judd Legum's phrase from Popular.info.  And if you haven't subscribed to his newsletter at Popular.info, I recommend you do so.  It's free.  And it's brilliant.  And every day he comes out with one deep dive into a topic.  And Judd Legum is one of our very best investigative reporters.  He used to be one of the lead guys.  In fact, I think he might have been the head editor over at ThinkProgress.  And now he's on his own, and he's just doing a spectacular job.  So anyhow, this is called Devin Nunes's European Vacation.  And it's got a bunch of backstory here that I think is really important.  It's looking, you know, I made the comment earlier, in fact, I think in the first hour of the program, that it's looking like Devin Nunes may be going down.  I tweeted that a couple days ago, which provoked a whole lot of Bill Clinton-esque kinds of jokes, but nonetheless.  I do think that Nunes is in big trouble.  You'll recall last year, maybe it was the year before that, the House Ethics Committee did an investigation of Nunes.  That was in 2017.  The House Ethics Committee investigated whether he... You remember he was in this car with with some of his aides and he yells, you know, stop, stop the car.  I got to get out.  And he jumps out of the car and he just like vanishes.  And then a few hours later, he appears with a bunch of papers and says, and this is in the evening and says, I've got I've got the proof that, you know, Donald Trump was a good guy.  Excuse me, I had to sneeze and.  It turns out that he had stopped at the White House and gotten the stuff from Trump or Trump's people.  And he was, you know, it was just, it was all very, very weird.  And so the ethics committee, and he was disclosing classified information.  And they, ultimately the committee could never really determine whether he was guilty or not.  They closed the investigation and said, we can't find any fault here.  But that was because the White House would not declassify the information that they needed in large part.  In fact, according to a source who spoke to The Atlantic, this is from Judd's newsletter, the panel's inability to determine for itself what may or may not have been classified and what Nunes had actually been shown likely contributed to his decision to close the investigation.  Well, this time they're going to look into it again.  So here's what happened.  First of all, Nunes has falsely accused, he lied, and said that Adam Schiff was trying to get nude photos of Trump.  Never happened, no such thing.  He repeatedly came back to this so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy theory.  CrowdStrike is an American company that does internet security work.  Kind of forensic, you know, they look at computer systems that have been attacked and they help develop defense systems and things like that.  Now, the CEO of CrowdStrike, I believe, the current CEO, was born in Russia, but he's an American citizen.  He's an American.  And CrowdStrike is an American company, period, full stop.  And it's got nothing to do with Ukraine.  But Trump on Fox News on Friday said this Ukrainian company, CrowdStrike, no.  So anyhow, and then he says, and they never took possession of the server.  Well, if my computer here had gotten hacked, or I wanted CrowdStrike to tell me if it had gotten hacked... I don't have to take the computer to CrowdStrike.  That's silly.  I stick a USB drive in and clone my hard drive onto it.  So there's a mirror image of my hard drive.  Every single bit or bite on my hard drive is now on this USB drive.  And you give that to them, and then that way I can continue using my computer.  I don't, you know, I mean, you're going to shut down the DNC and take their servers off to some other company?  That doesn't make any sense at all.  So, yeah, CrowdStrike never took physical possession of the server, but they didn't need to.  They had the equivalent of the server.  And that's how it's always done.  But, you know, saying, well, they never took the server is like one of those lies of omission, right?  They never took the server because they didn't have to in order to see everything that was on the server.  I mean, that's the bottom line.  And then repeatedly, Nunes has tried to reveal the identity of the whistleblower or who he thinks is the whistleblower.  And all of that is in the context of intimidating anybody in the federal government who might think about blowing the whistle on him or on Trump or any of his corrupt buddies.  This is a guy who's suing a fictitious cow, Devin Nunes.  And so now he, you know, Judd Legum says he may have another motivation to throw up a smoke screen Because he was apparently part of, quoting Judd Legum, he allegedly was an integral part of the conspiracy that brought about the impeachment inquiry in the first place.  Now, how does this work?  Well, it turns out that Lev Parnas, you know, Lev and Igor, right, who had given Rudy Giuliani money and had illegally contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Donald Trump, Lev is alleging that Nunes met with, quote, former Ukrainian prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in Vienna last November.  Now, last November, you had Poroshenko as president.  Poroshenko was corrupt.  Viktor Shokin was his attorney general, essentially, his head prosecutor.  He was corrupt.  And Parnas said, and I quote, he worked to put Nunes in touch with Ukrainians, he being Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor general.  He worked to put Nunes in touch with Ukrainians who could help Nunes dig up dirt on Biden and Democrats in Ukraine.  End of quote from Parnas.  Now, if what Parnas is saying is correct, if this is true, this is a huge deal.  It means that everything that we've been accusing Trump of in this narrow area of criminality, Devin Nunes is apparently also guilty of, with the exception of withholding aid to Ukraine and blackmailing them.  I guess that's a big part of it, but pieces of it anyway.  that, you know, as Judd Legum writes, Nunes was asking, apparently, you know, if this is true, Nunes was asking a foreign national for something of value, specifically dirt on Biden, to help his preferred presidential candidate, Trump, and that could violate federal law.  Now, Nunes started out by saying, that's a lie, or words to that effect.  He said that the reporting of of Parnas' claims by both CNN and the Daily Beast.  And the Daily Beast one, you recall, was put into the congressional record by Eric Swalwell on the last, you know, last Thursday, the last day of the congressional inquiries at the Intelligence Committee.  Devin Nunes said this was demonstrably false and scandalous and the perfect example of defamation and reckless disregard for the truth.  And he promised that right after the Thanksgiving holiday, he was going to sue, he said this to Breitbart, he was going to sue CNN and the Daily Beast.  And then the March 4th, 2019 congressional records came out showing the money that he billed the government for his trip to Ukraine, or Vienna, excuse me, to meet Shokin.  And according to congressional records, Nunes did make a taxpayer-funded trip to Europe.  Now, we don't know for sure exactly where he went or what he did.  We just know that he and three of his aides actually billed the government, him for $18,000 and his three aides for $14,000.  Or no, I guess all four of them were $14,000.  It was all $14,200.  So that would have been probably round-trip first or business class airfare and a couple of nights at a fancy hotel.  14 grand would pretty much cover that.  You know, round-trip airfare from Washington, D.C.  to pretty much any European capital, in business class anyway, is typically around $5,000 or $6,000, and in first class around $10,000.  And then, you know, $400 for a couple nights in a nice hotel.  Or $4,000, excuse me.  And so Congressman Jim Hines, the Democrat from Connecticut, he says the allegation is that Devin Nunes used federal funds to fly himself and a couple of staffers over there in search of dirt on Biden.  So this member of Congress is now saying this out loud.  So this leads to yesterday, Sunday, on Fox News.  He was asked point blank.  I believe this is Chris Wallace.  Asked Devin Nunes.  He says, bottom line, were you in Vienna with Shokin?  Now, if the answer to that is no, you would think that he would say, no, I wasn't.  If the answer to that was yes, you would expect that he would start throwing as much crap against the wall as he possibly could in the hopes that, or against the window in the hopes that eventually you couldn't see through it, to torture a metaphor.  And here was Devin Nunes' answer on Fox News yesterday to the question, were you in Vienna with Shokin?  I really want to answer all these questions, and I promise you I absolutely will come back on the show and answer these questions, but because there's criminal activity here and we're working with the appropriate law enforcement agencies, we are going to file all this.  Everyone's going to know the truth.  Everybody's going to know all the facts, but I think you're going to understand that I can't compete by trying this debate out with the public media when 90% of the media are totally corrupt.  And because this is criminal in nature, because it's so bad, so slanderous, we've got all the facts on our side, and we're going to go to file in federal court because I'm not going to sit here and try to compete against the media that I have no chance of winning this.  Right.  So this is almost certainly going to go to the House Ethics Committee.  When Rudy Giuliani was asked on Fox News about Devin Nunes going and meeting with Shokin in Vienna... Giuliani didn't say that he knew that he had or he hadn't.  He said, and I quote, if he did, there would have been nothing wrong with it.  He also, you know, I mean, this is basically his line.  He says, if Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and the Democrats, there's nothing wrong with that.  And that's apparently now going to be their defense in the Senate, in the trial in the Senate, is that, yeah, you know, Trump wanted to investigate Biden and the Democrats.  And Trump was, you know, wanted them to, you know, investigate all this stuff.  And he wanted an investigation of CrowdStrike and all this stuff.  because he's president and one of his jobs is to stop corruption and he thought this was all corrupt.  That's the sales pitch that they're going to use.  Now, Devin Nunes is not making that pitch, I think because he knows it would get him at the very least censured and perhaps thrown out of the U.S.  House of Representatives.  But Trump is going to try this.  Do you think it's going to work?  Do you think Nunes is going to end up in jail? ",
