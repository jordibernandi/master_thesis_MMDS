Right here in 12 years.  Yeah?  In 12 years, I'll be right here.  Right here in your fossil fuel guzzling Jeep.  Nah, that ain't going to hurt a damn thing because all these people that drive by it, it's got jets and buses and they go everywhere they're going in them.  So, you know what I'm saying?

Because he sticks to the shit that he says.  Damn right.  He's got career politicians.  He don't need money to back him up.  That's what I'm saying.  Because he's already raised up all our freaking jobs and everything like that.  If you looked in the past, like Obama and everything, he's quadrupled, oh, excuse me, doubled our debt and everything like that.  Us, we've turned around already, brought back our monies from China and everything like that.  We've turned around, made negotiations with North Korea and stuff.  Name one other president that has done that.  None.  He didn't have to prove himself, but he did.  He's already done more right now than he's done any other president's done.

Get the wall built.  Keep doing what he's doing.  Absolutely.  Don't cut him no slack.  Don't let him back you down.  Yeah.  Hold him around.  Take Hillary to prison.  Yeah.  That ain't no s***.  Put all them son of a b**** in prison.  What do you think you want to see Trump do if he gets re-elected in 2020?  Finish the wall, number one.  Finish the wall.  The reason Trump should be president in 2020 is he's stuck to everything he has said.  He don't f*** around.  He said, look, this is going to happen, this is going to happen.
