            "text": "Hey y'all, I have some new merch.  Stick around to the end of the video to learn more about it.  So I recently decided for like the fifth time in ten years to mute my notifications from people I don't follow on Twitter, because Twitter can be a dramatic hellscape sometimes.  But before I did that, I noticed a common trend.  Someone would post a tweet asking for recommendations, for creators of color who talk about politics.  And I was often one of the people recommended.  There was an uptick of this recently in light of a discussion people were having about how the political space on YouTube seems to be dominated by white people.  I talked about this a little bit in my last video.  Now one of the things I pointed out is that there really isn't a shortage of non-white YouTubers, even among those who discuss political and social issues.  But for some reason, a lot of these creators of color seem to be completely absent from white people's radars.  Which is why I assume there are all these threads asking for recommendations.  Now in terms of YouTube, I'm sure a lot of this has to do with the way the algorithm recommends videos to people.  But the algorithm does suggest videos based on your user activity.  But even outside of YouTube, you're hard pressed to see the work of people of color signal boosted by white people.  Unless it's like Lizzo or something.  So there's this weird paradox of people seemingly wanting to learn more about the experiences and ideas of people of color, while also managing to completely avoid all of their work.  It's a curious situation, but it reminds me of a question that I get asked a lot.  I am T1J.  Follow me.  Let's check the voicemail.  Hey, T1J. ",

As a white guy who used to be very much in the anti-feminist, anti-SJW sphere, I'm kind of curious, where do I even begin in looking for resources to sort of expand my knowledge about sort of the struggles faced by marginalized groups and stuff like that?  I think a lot of white folks who are trying to be, you know, more of an ally could do with a primer on where to start, you know, educating themselves on these issues.  But, hey, keep doing what you're doing and have a good day. ",

            "text": "So this is a common question, and I can understand how it might be kind of overwhelming to want to be a good ally, but feel like you're just not informed enough or maybe afraid that you might get something wrong, especially in the social media era where people have very little patience for the perceived missteps of others because they're so fucking perfect, right?  But you may also find that marginalized people are often unenthusiastic about being put in a position to educate others, or to teach people how to educate themselves.  Which is fair, they don't have to.  And in many cases, they're not well equipped to.  Not everyone is skilled at dissecting topics in a way that is accessible to others.  But even for those who are, I can see how it could be frustrating to have to continuously explain what amounts to fairly basic information to people.  And some folks just don't feel like doing it.  But there are people like me who create content specifically to help people be more thoughtful about these kinds of things.  In fact, there are a lot of people who do that.  Like I said, in the internet era, there is no shortage of voices coming from disadvantaged communities.  people of color, LGBTQ people, disabled people, etc.  These voices are still marginalized and often silenced, especially when compared to more privileged groups, but they're definitely out there, and in my opinion, not that hard to find.  By the way, I say this with full respect to Matt, the caller from the voicemail.  I don't mean to imply anything negative about him specifically.  In fact, I think that his question comes from a place of sincerity.  I'm just using his question as a launching point for a broader conversation.  So take black people for example.  I get a lot of questions like Matt's where people want to know how they can learn more about the black experience and how to relate to black people more effectively.  Well, the easiest way to learn about black people is to listen to black people.  And the same goes for any group, really.  Now, some folks understand this to some extent, I think, which is why they keep tweeting at people for suggestions of POC creators.  But it's interesting how often that when people are asking for these suggestions, they're asking other white people.  And I know this because, as I said, I'm often tagged.  And also, sometimes I search myself on Reddit.  Don't judge me.  It's common for people to ask for these suggestions from either public figures, their own followers, or the members of a community they're a part of.  And don't get me wrong, I've had people ask me for suggestions as well, like our friend Matt from The Voicemail, especially after I talked about it in my last video.  But I get the sense that the people giving these suggestions are often, if not usually, other white people.  And to some extent, this is kind of a circular problem.  They very well can't ask people of color for suggestions if they don't know where to find them in the first place.  But again, some of y'all are pulling a Sandra Bullock.  What do you mean?  my memes aren't fresh?  And I'm not saying it's bad for white people to suggest content from people of color, but it's hard not to see this as people searching for content that has essentially been pre-approved by other white people, whether consciously or not.  I talked in my last video about how my channel seems to be white people approved.  which I think is why I'm one of the people who gets suggested so often.  But limiting your exposure only to those black voices which have been deemed palatable by white people really only gives you a fractured view of the black experience.  It's a start, and it's valid, and you should take it seriously, but there's so much more.  So really, there's an important first step for anyone that's trying to learn more about the experiences of marginalized groups.  Don't you get Stop asking other people to do the work for you.  Fun fact, Google is free.  I think Googling things is underrated.  Of course, not every result you stumble upon is going to be useful or constructive. ",

            "text": "So I wanted to try something here to sort of give an example of what I'm talking about.  And I want to stress that this is not the only thing you should do if you're interested in learning more about marginalized groups or about anything.  But it's a good place to start and there's really no reason not to do it.  But just to make it as genuine as possible, I wanted to try an aspect of it that I'm less familiar with.  So I actually get to learn some things too while I'm making this video about how you can learn some things.  So one aspect that I am personally less familiar with is learning more about the plight of Native Americans.  There's certain things that I've learned just incidentally, but I've never like intentionally looked into those kinds of issues.  And I'd like to know more about it.  Another thing that I think that I'm going to have to keep in mind is that there are natives that aren't Americans.  So maybe just saying natives is just... better.  so you don't slip up because the term Native American just kind of flows in my head because I'm so used to it.  You know I wouldn't want to meet a native from say Canada and still say Native American.  so maybe I should get used to saying native which seems to be more preferred anyway.  Now say I wanted to learn more about the plight of natives in America.  Again we can make a starting point just by googling it.  This may seem silly but let's just try googling and see what happens.  So we've got a HuffPost article at the top there.  Sometimes HuffPost is really good and sometimes it's really dubious.  So let's see, what are 13 issues that Natives are dealing with?  I do like when articles give you things to click on.  Native Americans face issues of mass incarceration and policing.  I didn't even know that.  Native peoples are disproportionately affected by mass incarceration.  In states with significant Native populations, Native Americans are widely overrepresented in the criminal justice system.  In South Dakota, for example, Native Americans make up 9% of the total population, but 29% of the prison population, 29%, that's a lot of people.  So, you know, that's a claim, and they dropped a link.  So we can click on that link and see what it links to.  This, so you would say, okay, this is a graph that just kind of repeats the same thing.  You want to, if you really wanted to fact check it, you want to go to the actual study that they're citing.  So I don't know much about this site.  This site is called prisonpolicy.org.  But yeah, so that's something that you might want to do.  So this is their, this is sort of the results of their study.  And that's just South Dakota, but that's still wild.  In Alaska, that's 38% of the prison population.  In Hawaii, they're 39%.  And if you wanted to fact check all of those things and look at the sources, you could and probably should do that.  Native communities are often impoverished and jobless.  That's something we probably could have guessed as racial minorities.  Federal government is still stripping native people of their land.  That's something that I want to know more about, actually.  Violence against women and children is especially prevalent in native communities.  So as I could have guessed, it seems that Native Americans deal with a lot of the same social and economic issues that other ethnic minorities deal with.  And they have unique issues as well, such as Being indigenous people, they have a claim to a lot of the land and a lot of the land, even the ones that they have been given sovereignty over is being taken away from them.  So that's a. that's an issue that's unique to that group specifically.  But whoever wrote that article did pretty did a pretty good job of linking to things.  So there's a lot of things that click on.  like i said just don't be lazy like it's very not hard just literally type it into google and click on stuff like really.  um one thing i am interested in being a youtuber like.  i am not familiar.  i don't think of any native american youtubers or any native or indigenous youtubers at all.  so i'll just type in native american youtubers.  I guess I'll just click this top 49 native native indigenous YouTubers.  Sook Tiaoma.  Sook Tiaoma.  I just I literally just click this to see if she would say her name.  He's got a clip of his family celebrating Thanksgiving Day.  And this is interesting because I think I think a lot of people don't think that Native Americans celebrate Thanksgiving.  But some of them do.  This is awesome.  This person makes like wooden stop motion videos.  It appears to be in the native language, but it's still really cool.  So this is the perfect video for me right now.  This is a person who apparently has made a sort of resource to find native YouTubers.  So this is kind of exactly what I'm looking for.  So this is another video that's just like a list of native YouTubers.  So there's a few of these.  It kind of reminds me of sort of old school YouTubers where people were just kind of in it just to make videos and stuff.  They weren't doing it for money or doing it for fame.  They just like making videos and like interacting with the community.  And it seems like that's what's going on here.  And I really dig it a lot actually. ",

            "text": "So I think that literally Google is a great place to start learning about other people and other cultures.  And if you're doing an earnest deep dive, you will no doubt find an unlimited amount of things to read, watch, or listen to.  I thought it was especially cool that I was able to find a couple of lists of native creators as suggested by other native creators.  which is to say lists that haven't been curated by white people.  A lot of those channels might feel a little bit out of my wheelhouse.  I might not relate to them that much, but that's the point.  If I refuse to leave my comfort zone, then I'm limiting how much I can learn.  But there's no magic bullet to this kind of thing.  People are complicated.  And if you want to learn more about them, it's going to take some work.  It's also important to acknowledge that no matter how much recon or research you do on a group of people, you will always lack that firsthand experience.  So you'll never be able to get the full story.  And firsthand experience, in my opinion, is the most significant factor.  So Googling is just the tip of the iceberg.  Ultimately, you're going to have to actually talk to people who have that firsthand experience.  If you don't know a lot about the people in these groups, it's likely that you have a few preconceived ideas about them.  And if you don't have any experience with them, then those notions are almost certainly incorrect or incomplete, whether they are good or bad.  And the best way to break through that is just to spend time with the people.  And I'm not really talking about emailing them questions or inviting them on your podcast.  I mean, if you want to do that, feel free to try to do that.  But I mean real, ongoing human interactions.  Speak with your neighbors and co-workers and classmates.  Meet their families.  Attend their events.  Instead of going to karaoke Saturday night and belting out total eclipse of the heart like you usually do, maybe try going to the jazz club where all the old black people hang out.  Or go watch a drag show at a gay bar.  Attend political events.  Go to meetings.  Join social clubs.  Just hang out with people, really.  Of course, be respectful.  I think that these types of things are usually welcoming to everyone, but it's important to understand that sometimes people in marginalized groups require their own spaces where they feel safe.  So like, if you're going to be weird, definitely don't go.  But if you do, just relax and be nice.  And if people are uncomfortable with you being there, just politely leave and try something else.  I'm not telling you to ask questions or interview people or even observe.  I'm saying just go hang out, interact, be a person in the world outside of your bubble.  I believe that forming real relationships with other human beings is the most effective solution to prejudice.  And it's really just the best way to learn about other people.  And once you do all this, I feel like your main takeaway is gonna be that people are just people.  Whether they are black, or white, or gay, or trans, or disabled, or Jewish, or Muslim.  Whether they are gangstas, or religious, or sex workers, or musicians, or athletes.  The range of character traits is pretty much the same.  People are just people.  Some people are awesome, and some people are not so awesome.  And what group you in rarely has anything to do with it.  But you should also eventually pick up on the fact that people in certain groups have unique issues that they have simply because they are a part of that group.  And for many of those groups, those issues are systemic and oppressive.  And finally, you'll also probably figure out that no group is a monolith.  Even within the same communities, different people live different lives and have different worldviews and different ideas about how to solve their issues.  And all of those ideas are at the very least worth listening to.  And of course, this makes everything much more complicated, but nobody said it was gonna be easy.  I think the hardest part is just being humble enough to recognize that sometimes you just lack the first-hand experience needed to truly understand what someone else is going through.  Sometimes you just have to listen and believe.  And I know the rational skeptics act like they hate that phrase, but really that's just a basic part of being a compassionate human being.  When someone tells you your story, you don't be a dick about it.  Pretty basic stuff.  So the last step is to take what you're learning and bring it back to your own friends and family and community.  And I'm not asking you to preach or become an activist.  I mean, if you want to, feel free, but it's not necessary.  But you can start discussions.  You can challenge the ideas that you hear.  You can ask those people the same questions that you're asking Google.  It's difficult to get to a point where you feel like you can fully understand someone else's situation.  In fact, it may be technically impossible.  But learning and researching the basics and beginning to develop empathy for other human beings I think is not that complicated.  You just have to stop being lazy.  What might be difficult, I suspect, is getting to the point where you admit that you need to do that in the first place.  Which is why I appreciate people like Matt.  But that's just me though.  What do you think?  Thank you for watching my video, and thanks to everyone that supports me on Patreon.  My patrons are literally what keeps this channel afloat, so if you like what I do and want to help me out, consider dropping a buck a month on Patreon.  I'm also pretty excited to announce the launch of my new T1J merch.  I've had a lot of different ones throughout the years, but I wanted to take it back to the basics with some new Das Just Mito and Heiko t-shirts.  as well as these cute little T1J chibi stickers.  I got one right here.  You can check these out at theonejanitor.com slash store.  This is also another great way to support the channel if you like what I do.  Also, if you'd like to send me a question or a comment, or if you just want to say hi, you can call the number on your screen and leave me a voicemail, and maybe I'll respond to it in a future video.  Thanks again for watching, and remember to stay HAKO.  Come on. ",
