You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, and yet I'm one of the lucky ones.  People are suffering.  People are dying.  Entire ecosystems are collapsing.  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.  How dare you? ",

            "text": "I'm sorry, Greta, but you're scolding the wrong people.  Whether or not I buy into the current climate hysteria is beside the point.  The point is that you're aiming your anger in the wrong direction.  China is the world leader in greenhouse gas emissions, by far, and they're not slowing down anytime soon.  Even if the West cut all of their emissions and went back to horses and sailboats, it wouldn't matter.  China and India will easily put enough greenhouse gas into the air for us all to find out whether or not your dire predictions will come true.  And by your dire predictions, I mean the United Nations predictions.  Because let's be honest, Greta, you don't know anything about climate science that has not been told to you by adults with an agenda.  Fighting climate change by yelling at the countries who have cut greenhouse emissions is a lot like fighting gun crime by taking guns away from law-abiding citizens.  We have kids in this country who scold us about that issue.  I appreciate your passion, but it's not us who have taken away your childhood.  We didn't get into your head when you were a little girl and exploit your obsessive-compulsive disorder by filling your mind with terrifying scenarios.  That was your parents.  I know that they are both actors and entertainers, and that your sister is, too.  Your whole family are dramatic people who love the spotlight.  It must be very hard to see them get so much attention when half the time you can't even bring yourself to speak.  It's easy to understand why you would let them push you into the international limelight to scold people with many times your life experience.  But why take on that burden?  We didn't put you up to this, and we are not looking for you to save the world.  You say you should be in school.  Just being a girl, you should.  Who is stopping you?  If you want to be mad at your generation's parents, be mad at them for building enormous expensive social safety nets and then importing millions of foreigners who will eventually erase the Scandinavian culture you grew up with.  Be mad at them for dismantling everything that your ancestors struggled to build.  If you want to cry about a crisis that your generation will inherit, focus on that.  You have plenty to be mad about right there in your own home country.  You've had your natural teenage rebellion hijacked and turned outward by your own parents.  They've made you an international symbol.  They've set you down in the middle of a media tug-of-war.  Even a girl without your complicated emotions would have trouble dealing with that.  When they should be protecting you, they're hiding behind you.  Greta, the planet has survived direct hits by comets that wiped out half of all life, volcanoes that blackened out the sun for years.  It has cooled enough that all of northern Europe was under a mile-thick glacier.  And then it warmed enough that all of that ice receded and left behind the green world that you know and love.  The planet doesn't even know.  we're here, Greta.  You don't need to lie awake at night worrying about Mother Earth or the ability of human ingenuity to keep up with the changes.  I have a daughter upstairs sleeping as I talk to you.  She's just learning to walk.  Do you think I need you to tell me that she will live with the decisions we make?  Do you think that solving this supposed crisis rests on your shoulders?  If you do, your parents should be charged with child abuse.  Putting the focus on kids is how the left pushes these issues.  They fill you up with their ideas and push you out in front of the cameras.  You are correct that some adults don't care about children.  You are correct that some adults are eager to leave you with a world damaged by their own excesses.  You have been conned into thinking that these adults live far away and not under your own roof.  Go home, Greta.  Be a girl.  Hang out with your friends and flirt with boys.  So far as I can see, people are still retiring to warm places near the ocean.  Our own climate change president just spent $15 million on a beach house.  The world is not coming to an end.  And if it was, it's not your place or your responsibility to tell grown-ups what to do about it.  And that's the simple truth.  Thanks for watching.
