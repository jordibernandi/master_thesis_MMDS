            "text": "You see?  It's a revolution.  Capitalism's days are numbered.  Then there goes our freedom.  If socialism wins, America loses.  We have nothing to lose but our chains.  And our civilization.  Come on.  Learn some history.  Private property and free markets built modern-day society.  And modern society is the problem.  Two for March of History.  Thank you.  Enjoy the show, boys.  Look at this theater.  Look at all of this plenty.  This is capitalism.  So capitalism's diabetes?  Shh.  Got it.  Sorry.  Your whole world is coming apart.  I pity you.  America is once again at ideological war.  After decades of post-war consensus, the great debate between capitalism and socialism has captured the public square.  And no two men have more fervently fought this battle than socialist philosopher Karl Marx and classical liberal economist Ludwig von Mises.  Marx versus Mises.  Mises versus Marx.  The march of history continues.  world assemble.  it's time for the ruling classes to tremble.  i'm the people's hero the mvp mars.  yeah you know me.  let's go back to when men were free.  we hunted and gathered communally.  but get ready Cause.  here comes the twist.  A villain appears called a capitalist.  He puts the proletariat in chains.  Exploits our labor in pockets of gains.  Through slick ads he tricks lads and ladies in kind.  Selling fake knees.  he poisons our hearts and minds.  He rots our soul through alienation.  Pursuing limitless accumulation.  He works us into an early grave.  Through debt steals back the money we save.  Greed is the gospel.  Profit?  No.  The rich get richer through graph-debt fraud.  The poor get poorer, but you don't care.  Doesn't that sound laissez-en-faire?  Two hundred years I've been singing this song.  Now my chorus is 99% strong.  The revolution's here.  It's time to repent.  Your moment is over.  Your capital's spent.  This is history's lesson.  You think he's right, then get a sin.  All he wants is progression.  Without a bourgeois objection.  So we look for the truth As we tighten our boots.  Who's right?  Who's wrong?  Left, right, left, now the march is on.  Guten Tag, Marx.  Nice to meet you.  My name's Ludwig.  Call me teacher.  The master of markets.  The Austrian boss.  You don't like profits?  Well, let's talk loss.  The problem with your plan is nobody wins except Stalin, Pol Pot, Ho Chi Minh, Lenin, Mugabe.  Remember Berlin?  They built a wall to keep their people in.  Your theories have a rotten foundation.  built on control, not cooperation.  Centralized power completely corrupts.  Real people suffer.  Violence erupts.  Your system depends on the very same people you decry as greedy, bourgeois, and evil.  If we're not meant to run our own lives, why would you expect our votes to be wise?  If you really want to help people rise up, Unleash the free market, live their lives up.  If with capitalism, not a socialist plan.  Sink billions in India, China, Japan.  Everyone has a unique purpose and plan.  No one solution can serve the whole land.  Each individual has their own voice.  The heart of my theory is freedom and choice.  This is history's lesson.  The market's a blessing.  Let's pursue our expression.  Livin' free from aggression.  So we look for the truth With the freedom to choose Who's right, who's wrong.  Left, right, left, now the march is on.  Free marketeers love to play this game.  Mao kills billions, Marx gets blamed.  It's deceptive, dishonest, plain unfair.  Did I drive the tanks at Tiananmen Square?  Man, I'm a humanist.  You can check my receipts But you gotta break eggs if you wanna eat.  Don't like violence?  Admit defeat, then I'll call this revolution complete.  Till then, let's get a few things straight.  I'm not shaping the future, I'm embracing our fate.  My utopian forebears weren't that specific, but this analysis is highly scientific.  Every social system has governing laws.  Capitalism?  Doom, because the system generated its own fatal flaws by uniting workers in a common cause.  Thanks to you, we have all the wealth we need to seize control.  And eradicate greed.  The people are rejecting your bourgeois lies.  Real Marxism has never been tried.  Equality is the core of my creed.  From this one's ability to that one's need.  Our healthcare, finance, and industry.  Let's collectivize and set ourselves free.  Your standard refrain.  Oh, that's not the real thing.  The most common verse all your followers sing.  The closer we get to your ideal system, further we go down the road to surfer.  The empirical record can't be denied.  Your ideas don't work, but they just won't die.  Attention!  This is not breaking news.  Jevons and Manger lit that fuse.  Now here comes the bomb via Von Bonbevert.  He blew up your system, exposed the corkwork.  The heart of your theory is exploitation of surplus value.  That's a bogus equation.  You can't explain value by measuring the cost of labor.  That theory of value is lost favor.  Value is subjective by every measure.  One man's trash is another man's treasure.  There's no exploitation if two people arrange.  Voluntary exchange, man, that's not deranged.  That bourgeois transaction you dissed with a scoff creates benefit for both, so we're both better off.  Here's the real problem, the crucial equation.  Without private markets, there's no calculation.  To coordinate causes, allocate resources, incentivize choices, because it lacks prices.  Where should this factory go?  How would your planet ever know?  Your theory is a bundle of confusion.  Socialism got crushed by the marginal revolution.  This is history's lesson.  All we want is progression.  Let's pursue our expression.  Are you kidding me, Mises?  My immiseration thesis tears you to pieces.  Your economy grows, but not our wages.  You call that progress?  I think it's outrageous.  In 1820, everyone was poor until capitalism kicked down the door.  Real wage growth, not stagnation, saved 80% of the world from starvation.  You kicked down the door, but you locked us out.  That's what your free market is all about.  Here's what you do.  On your next shopping spree, pick up this book by my boy Tommy P. The pie can get bigger.  It's not zero-sum.  Free markets have lifted the lowest incomes.  If you really want to help out the poorest nations, encourage peace, trade, and immigration.  The earth is boiling, and your solution is more production, more pollution, more cheap trinkets and bigger malls, more fossil fuels, more aerosol?  For a problem this big, we need total control.  A Green New Deal to save the North Pole.  We can't gamble the future on anarchy.  Greed's not a plan, it's insanity!  Your story's bombastic, your rhetoric's strong.  There's only one problem, your theory's wrong!  The wealthiest countries do the most to conserve.  Have a habit, you heard, of the Kuznets curve.  Only wealthy societies can afford to go green.  If you want a better world, see the unseen.  Even carbon will bend to creative destruction With entrepreneurship in the means of production.  This is history's lesson.  The market's a blessing.  All we want is progression Living free from aggression.  So we look for the truth.  I said it before, and I'll say it again.  The long march of history will come to an end.  Hegel was close, but too a priori.  Watch me break down my dialectical story.  Proletariat, bourgeoisie, them versus us, you versus me, slave, master, lord, and serf.  New class battles, same old turf.  We have what we need to throw the chains off us.  Organize the economy like the post office.  The state takes over, but that's not the whole plan.  Watch it wither away and leave socialists mad.  Our goal is true fairness.  Outcomes that are equal.  Capitalism over.  Here's a socialist sequel.  Revolution's coming.  Prepare for the fight.  Workers of the world unite!  Nothing is determined.  You're so fatalistic.  A grand theory of history?  Be realistic.  You fail predictions?  A distraction.  Here's some questions that got human action.  Where are we going?  What's the right course?  What will motivate us?  Incentives or force?  Here's what you miss from commanding heights.  Each person's gifts and individual rights.  Across every continent, culture, and creed, people have flourished only when free to find passion, profit, charity, and love through the shape of a hand, not a boot from above.  Socialism's record isn't hard to parse.  First it was tragedy, now it's a farce.  Let's unite people from every nation in peace, exchange, and cooperation.  Wow.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So... I told you Marx was right.  It's Mesa's all the way.  The free market brings the goods.  Yeah, it brings the goods, all right.  A heaping pile of inequality and strife.  Try peace and prosperity.  Yeah, I am.  I am trying that.  You are?  Yeah.  Okay, because it doesn't look like it.  Did you watch this?  Yeah.  Half of it was good.
