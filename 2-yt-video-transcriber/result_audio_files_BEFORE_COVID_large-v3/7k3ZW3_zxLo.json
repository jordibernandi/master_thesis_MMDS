            "text": "Bluebird just left.  Restricted area, no trespassing.  There's our warning.  Wright's Crispy here with Rogue Nation.  Captain Awesome.  We're here to see what we the people can see.  Looks like it's going to clear up.  I think I talked too much in my last video, so I might do the silent treatment today.  Oh, here's the bluebird again.  Bus driver was looking hard.  Oh, he's looking again.  Rubberneck.  Pay attention, buddy.  Don't worry about a camera.  So, I'm sure they've seen me.  Don't tell me what to do.  I'm going to stop and stand right here.  We have a babysitter?  The water droplets are kind of messing up my screen.  I'm having a hard time zooming in and out because of the water.  Yeah, he's watching us.  Oh, this is our entrance?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was watching us.  Well, you got to catch me.  How are you?  Fantastic.  How are you?  Yeah, can I help you?  No.  No?  Just out here, okay.  Go about your day.  Okay.  Let me film my video.  Okay, do your thing, man.  Thank you.  All right, have a good day.  You too.  Perfect.  What's your name and badge number?  Oh, Deputy Clanton 7455.  Is that a little passive aggression tone?  No, it's just being nice.  Sure.  Have a great day.  Stay safe.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, W. Fantastic.  How are you?  Yeah, can I have your name and badge number, please?  I'm sorry.  J. Lo Chan.  Lo Chan?  83-34.  CCN number.  83-34?  No, 33.  Do me a favor.  Watch your back, please.  Right on.  Unless you want to secure the camera and go in the building, that's fine.  We have a public lobby.  I didn't say you weren't.  Well, that's the lobby, not the jail itself.  That's correct.  But what I'm trying to do right now is find out who you work for, why you're here.  Okay, well, we have areas where media is allowed to set up.  We're allowed anywhere, sir.  We're allowed anywhere that the general public's allowed, so we're not setting up anything.  We don't like being told where to set up.  I'm not approaching you in that manner.  I'm trying to identify why you're here.  Right on.  Well, do you do that with any other citizen conducting legal activities on public roads?  With the camera in this vicinity, yes.  Is that illegal?  I didn't say that.  Then?  I just said that if you're with media, that there's an area where you can set up.  The other two deputies asked if they can help me, and I told them yes.  You could allow me to film my video without bothering me.  Will you do the same thing, Sergeant Carlin?  I don't have a problem with that.  Right on.  Thank you.  You're dismissed.  Unless you needed something else, Captain.  All right, you're dismissed, Sergeant.  We'll leave it at that, and I appreciate your cooperation.  Fantastic.  Thank you.  We didn't cooperate, though.  We cooperated with tyrants trying to stop and identify people like it's 1930s Germany.  That's not what I did.  That's what it is.  Thank you.  We the people know why we're here.  We the people know why we're here.  I don't know.  Looks illegal.  Special privileges.  They have dash cams here.  Yeah.  It's a first class city.  Yeah, maybe.  Sergeant Carlin, K-A-R-L-I-N.  I just had to do that because he was being dismissive to me, so I had to dismiss him.  Yeah, absolutely.  I didn't mean to step on the toes there.  That's funny. ",
