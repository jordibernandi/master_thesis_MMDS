            "text": "All right!  National Youth Annual out here in the city of San Luis Obispo, California, located on the beautiful Central Coast.  And right now I'm going to be conducting a First Amendment audit of MindBody.  I want to make sure that our friends at MindBody respect and honor my mind and my constitutional right to record in public.  So let's go over there and shake them up.  So yeah, folks, this is it.  This is MindBody.  The company was founded in 2001, and it serves as a cloud-based software management company for the wellness community.  And their current CEO is Rick Stollmeyer.  And I decided to audit this place because I used to work for a courier.  Well, I used to work as a courier for a laboratory, and I used to pick up samples at some doctor's offices near here.  And so I used to drive by this place a lot, and I always wondered what it was, you know, because they own, like, this whole complex here.  And so... I decided to audit it.  I actually wanted to audit it back then, but I was always working.  And then by the time I got off work, they were closed, or I was just too tired or whatnot.  So I figured since I'm in the area, I would check it out, see if MindBody here in the beautiful city of San Luis Obispo, or otherwise known to the locals as SLO, See how they react to public photography.  Looks like we got a mind-body employee.  That or maybe he's security or whatnot, but I don't know.  Hopefully he's got a mind that is well and a body that is well.  I know what would suit me well would be a double bacon western cheeseburger from Carl's Jr.  So I was reading an article in the Tribune, which is the local paper for SLO County, and I guess last Christmas Eve, MindBody was acquired by a private equity firm in San Francisco.  And I guess it was kind of like really on the down low.  But some of the employees were concerned that MindBody might move out of the area.  But when this article was written, CEO Rick Stollmeyer confirmed that MindBody would be staying in the community because apparently he lives in the area and wants to keep MindBody right here in slow.  So MindBody's not going anywhere, folks.  So for those of you tech people that are probably making $130,000, $140,000 a year, you can continue to live on the beautiful Central Coast and reap the benefits.  So this is actually their headquarters.  They're based here out of San Luis Obispo.  and uh it's pretty interesting uh that uh there's a big uh software company like this that's located somewhere besides the silicon valley.  but uh what do you want to bet?  that company that uh acquired mind body is eventually going to move them up to the bay area because that company is based out of san francisco.  so Who knows how much longer mind-body will actually be in the area.  They're here for now.  Now, I've noticed here that all the windows are tinted.  You can't see in.  And that kind of makes me wonder... Why so secretive?  I mean, the company claims to be a software management company that provides services to the wellness community, but I don't know.  What are they doing back there?  Are they maybe developing Spy?  Software for the Chinese.  What are they doing in MindBody?  Well, I'm going to guess that's a MindBody employee because she's got... multicolored hair and she's wearing a badge and she's dressed like she belongs at a rave opposed to an office.  Maybe we can ask her about mind-body.  See if maybe she can help me with my mind and my body.  Or maybe something else.  Uh-oh.  Are these people just out for a stroll, or are they coming over to talk to me?  Maybe this is the mind-body police.  Are they going to... Well, maybe they can help me with my mind and my body.  I don't know what they're doing.  Or maybe they're Scientologists.  I don't know.  I don't know what they're doing.  They're definitely... Are they stopping to decide whether they should... Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Are they going to sneak up on me or come out over here?  Hi.  I'm great, thank you.  How are you?  Good.  Can I help you?  No, I'm fine.  Okay.  Yeah. ",

She says she's going to get the CHP.  Uh-oh.  She's on the phone, so yeah.  Well, what?  Well, I wonder who she's calling.  I mean, it went from the CHP, who she said is located on campus, which is a bunch of BS, because I know where the CHP SLO station is.  Well, I mean, unless they have like a satellite office here, but it went from them to SLO PD to, I don't know, who's it going to be next?  Maybe Ghostbusters?  I don't know.  Wow.  Well, that didn't take long.  Well, maybe they're doing something more than just providing software management for the wellness community.  Maybe they are making data processors for the Chinese government.  So apparently, MindBody has a problem with my filming.  Apparently the mind people here do mind the fact that I'm recording their property.  So I'm going to continue to record because I want to.  And my mind tells me that I should keep doing so.  So I'm down here at the end of the campus, as they like to call it.  That's another thing about these tech companies like this.  They like to refer to them as campuses, not complexes or buildings or whatnot.  Oh, somebody's waving.  But yeah, they like to.  be known as campuses, like when me and First Amendment Test audited Facebook, you know, we went to their Bay Area campus in Menlo Park.  That was interesting.  For those of you who want to check that out, that's on my channel as well.  Well, peekaboo, there they are.  They're still keeping an eye on me.  What's she doing?  What's he doing?  How you doing?  Good, how you doing?  I'm good, thanks.  Now we got the police here.  Well, he's not pursuing.  Well, we got the slow PD on the scene.  He's not pursuing, but they definitely called, so they weren't lying about that.  So I don't know if he's gonna follow me and try to see where my car's parked or whatnot.  Or maybe he's waiting for backup.  We'll see.  That's the slow PD there.  Is he gonna try to talk to me or?  There's the PD, they're lurking.  Oh, is he waiting to see where I'm gonna go, where I got the car parked or whatnot?  I might assume he's already spoken with MindBody, so.  hopefully he's educated him but in just drive off he's over there lurking so i don't know.  we'll see what he does.  let's see if he follows me.  yeah there he is.  he's.  he's definitely following me or trying to see where i'm going.  let's see.  i've never seen him before.  I guess.  slow PD, I guess they allow their officers to have beards now, which is interesting.  There he is.  He's taking off.  All right, well, who knows if that'll be the last that I see of him.  We'll see.  Hopefully he gave mind, body, and education.  And we got a little Miss Muffet down there.  She's still wandering around like she's got nothing better to do.  I wonder if she's going to come over.  Oh, she's still on the phone, so she's not giving up.  Maybe she's going to try the CHP next.  Slow PD, that didn't go anywhere.  Well, I'm going to go ahead and wrap this audit up.  I'm going to go ahead and say that MindBody has failed this audit.  I mean, they gave me some garbage about privacy laws, but then she acknowledged that I was on a public sidewalk, but then she said she was going to call the CHP, and then from the CHP it went to the slow PD, and I mean, I don't know who else she's called.  You know, maybe Doc Hopper.  Either way, I'm going to say that MindBody has failed the audit.  I will, however, give Slow PD a pass, or at least that officer.  I mean, he responded to the call because obviously he got a call for service, but he didn't push it.  So I'll definitely give Slow PD a pass.  So anyways, that's the verdict.  Fail for MindBody and a pass for Slow PD.  So anyways, Nancy Nathaniel saying happy trails. ",
