I'm hoping this is good for the next talk that I have where someone... feels like they might be setting up for a trick question, because I'm really not.  I hope you've seen from my conversations that I had, that I'm really just trying to interest it and just trying to find good ways to understand things.  And I found that the people who are unable to recognize what it would look like if they're wrong are missing a crucial aspect to having a credible and reliable... method to determine if something's true or not.  If I only have a system where I can detect the yeses and can't detect the nos, then I don't have a good system.  So I guess I'll get back to the basics.  But if we have trouble answering this again, it's totally fine.  I guess I'd ask for advice on how would you suggest I phrase the question for the next person.  But are you able to recognize what your misses look like with regard to whether or not the spot exists?  That's, I guess, what I'm asking.  Like in the event that, let's say a God did exist, but it wasn't the exact idea of God that you have.  It was pretty close, maybe like 99% close, but you're missing like 1% of that thing.  Like you're missing something pretty close.  And he's just like, hey, by the way, just letting you know, you got that 1% wrong, but it's cool.  And you're like, no, I was 100%.  Like clearly there's a distinction there.  So I'm asking you like, what is that?  Are you able to recognize what it would look like if you're wrong?  What would that look like? ",
