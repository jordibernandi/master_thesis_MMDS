            "text": "If Archangel Michael were to appear in tangible form at the Michael Vortex, how might that look and sense or feel?  A question for the Lady of the Lakes.  He will appear as a normal man.  You'll know exactly who he is.  You'll feel nothing but love and acceptance from him.  You know, he's not here to judge anybody.  But he is to help you find who you are.  You know, he's here to just help you on your direction.  Help you through your problems and find solutions.  You know, because you're helping him too.  Yes, he is full of light.  And humanity makes life very complicated.  But that also just purifies his light even more.  He's like, wow, I need to do more work here because so many people are dark.  I need to be at a lighter energy so they can feel my vibration.  So some of the angels are assisting.  Sometimes I feel like they're not doing enough.  Sometimes.  It's like I'm helping this person, I'm sending light to them, I'm helping them with their energy field, and they're still going into darkness.  What am I doing wrong?  You know, I'm helping them find the right choices, and they still fall into that, the old ways.  So it's part of their, it's not the overall thinking, but it's there.  So his energy is, oh yeah, if you call on him, definitely he'll appear out of nowhere.  Feel a gentleness, love and acceptance and help you heal the fear.  And laughter is key to everything.  You know, sometimes like comedians, they go through their own darkness, their own hell.  but it gives them something to laugh about.  It's like they go into themselves, their own darkness, and they pull out a joke for others to laugh at.  Not everyone's like that, but some are.  They need that dark energy to reflect light.  A lot of those are, once again, more angelic energies there.  So, yeah, laughter is key.  It helps.  So anything you find that's humorous, please connect to it.  It does help the vibrations a lot.  Having a positive sense of humor.  You know, you don't have to be perfect.  But his form will be humanoid, wearing white usually, long brown hair.  I don't see white hair or yellow hair, but it can be like a blonde.  Blonde or brown hair is not giving me a full indication of it.  I see him wearing white.  It doesn't mean he's going to have angel wings because it might be a little bit too much for some people, but he can.  But when his energy field is like, I'm not here to judge you at all.  I'm here to love you and care for you.  But I'm not here to interfere with your growth.  I'm here to help you with your growth.  Because we are helping the angels and their growth too.  We make life complicated, but that also, cause like we create a problem and they're already kind of solve it, help us out of our, out of their problems.  Like, Hey, I have this problem.  I get depressed when I see happy people.  So they help you through that.  Of course that might take a while.  It's like, we, we find problems for them to figure out for, for us to figure out.  They work through us to sort it out.  You find somebody, find nature.  you find energies to release those blockages. ",
