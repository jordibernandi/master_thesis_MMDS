            "text": "Question.  Yeah.  What's your question?  You have to just speak about your skin color because the matter for you was your skin color and nothing else.  All you spoke was about hate speech.  Okay.  All right.  So the question from the gentleman in the front, he asked the question, where does it say in Islam that you are to speak about color?  Because all we have spoken about today is... All we have spoken about today... All we've spoken about today is hate speech, to use his words.  Sounds like you've been watching the television.  Hate speech.  All we've spoken about today is hate speech and we're talking about color.  And there's no such thing as color in the Holy Quran.  I beg to differ.  In the Holy Quran, Allah says we take Allah's color.  In the Holy Quran, Allah talks about the mountains and the seams of colors in the mountains and the different colors of things that He created.  The reality is this, whether you like it or not, during the time of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, the Prophet had to deal with the contemporary reality that the Prophet found.  When the Prophet found the Quraysh and others in the Kaaba worshiping idols, the Prophet smashed them up.  The Prophet didn't accept that behavior from those people at that time.  Whatever the Prophet found that was happening, the Arabs at that time, they used to bury their girl children in the sand because they didn't like girls.  They believed that men were superior to girls.  Some of them were having sexual relations with camels.  The Prophet put a stop to all of that.  There were some evil practices, but when the Prophet came, he dealt with the contemporary reality that he found.  Well, today, whether you like it or not, Racism is a reality.  When I was born, I was born into a racist world.  So today, as a Muslim, it is incumbent on me to deal with the racism that I found.  I would be a fool to pretend that there was no racism.  And by the way, you know, because some of you tell, oh, there is no racism in Islam.  No, no, there's no racism in this.  There's no racism in this.  But among the Arabs, plenty of racism.  Among Pakistanis, plenty of racism.  Among so-called Muslims, plenty of racism.  So don't put that small-time stuff on us.  We know what you say and we know what you do.  And so, in Saudi Arabia today, black people are discriminated against.  In Islam, It's not taught in the book.  But they... Yeah, that's what I just said.  That's what I just said.  That's what I just said.  That's what I just said.  Yes, sir.  What it says, let me tell you what the Prophet Muhammad said.  The Prophet Muhammad in his last sermon to the Islamic Ummah, he warned them.  He said there is no superiority of the white over the black.  There is no superiority of the black over the white.  He was telling the Arabs this because the Arabs were already manifesting racism.  They were racist against Bilal.  They tortured Bilal because he was a black man.  Arabs, Arabs, racist Arabs.  The Prophet Muhammad taught a pure Islam, no racism.  But that's not what you lot practice.  What you practice is completely different to what the Prophet taught.  You are not following the Sunnah of the Prophet.  Yes, sir.  Shaytan is having an argument in the Holy Quran with Allah.  Shaytan says to Allah in the Holy Quran, because you have kept me disappointed, I'm going to come after them, the believers, in your straight path, Allah.  I'm going to come from before them.  I'm going to come from behind them.  I'm going to come from their right side and their left side, and I'm going to cause them to deviate.  And you will not find any of them grateful.  Allah says in the next verse, And I will fill hell with all who follow you.  And I'm saying to you with all humility, the Islamic world today, mostly we're following shaitan.  We're killing other Muslims.  We have set ourselves up as judges over who is a Muslim and who is not a Muslim.  Allah says in this book, He determines.  who is a believer and who is not a believer.  Allah says He will decide between those of you who differ.  But in the meantime, what we should be doing is demonstrating and proving to ourself That we are what we claim to be.  Not just on Friday at Jummah prayer.  And then for the rest of the week we're doing all manner of filth and evil.  That's not a Muslim.  And so we believe they're Muslims, brother.  And we believe that there are many beautiful Muslims in Saudi Arabia.  We believe there are many beautiful Muslims in Indonesia.  We believe there are many beautiful Muslims in Pakistan.  We believe there are many beautiful Muslims right here in the United Kingdom who are of different races and nationalities.  We believe that there are white Muslims who are good Muslims.  Because when you're a Muslim, it means that you bow down your will to do the will of God.  That's it.  And you are a righteous and a decent and a clean and a good person.  That's a Muslim.  It's got nothing to do with color.  But the reality is that today, Islam, which is the most beautiful system in the universe, because it means peace.  peace and submission to God.  It is the most beautiful system that you could ever find anywhere.  Islam is that which, that's what cleaned my life up.  I used to be crazy out there in those streets.  But when I found Islam, it changed my life.  But today, what has the white man done today?  He has made Islam synonymous with evil.  He has made Islam synonymous with terrorism.  So now when people hear Islam, they think about terrorists and people blowing themselves up.  But what you may not know is that the terrorism has been orchestrated.  Have you ever seen an orchestra?  Well, in front of an orchestra is always a conductor.  Somebody is conducting the terrorism.  It is orchestrated to bring Islam into total disrepute and to cause the world to look at Islam as a hated thing and to destroy Islam.  It is not a war on terror.  It is a war on Islam because Islam is the only thing that stands in the way of the white man having total domination on the planet. ",
