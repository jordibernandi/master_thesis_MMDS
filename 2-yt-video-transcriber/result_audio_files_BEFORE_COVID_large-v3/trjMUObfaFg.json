Some assume certain variables are constant, some assume the conditions are constant, and some are not 100% accurate but give us good predictive capabilities.  But those are explicitly stated within the definitions of those said formulas.  Let me give you a few examples.  The ideal gas law assumes that gases are ideal, which means gas laws are obeyed and molecules have no interactions between each other.  The second law of thermodynamics assumes an isolated system.  Ohm's law assumes that resistance is constant.  Hardy-Weinberg's equation assumes a large population where mating is random.  What do you see from these examples I've listed?  Yes, some of them assume something specific, and if that condition is met, then the equation is always correct.  Others, like Hardy-Weinberg, is useful in giving us predictions of scenarios, even if it doesn't exactly predict them itself.  And this is a nuance that only people exposed to science can really understand.  So as you can see, there are plenty of different laws.  Some are always true, some are true if an assumption is met, and some aren't 100% accurate, but give us good tools of predictive capabilities.  Going by the title of your video, I assume you're talking about gravity here, so let's see what you have to say.

If the object is far away, the vacuum cleaner's force on it would be so minuscule it wouldn't budge the object.  However, if the object is right up to the machine, it would be sucked up easily, and the force of this sucking is inversely proportional to the distance, meaning the closer you are, the stronger the force.

See, when this happens, multiple forces are at play, namely the force of gravity and angular momentum.  It's the same reason the moon orbits around the Earth.  Gravity tries to pull it in, but the angular velocity opposes it.  If gravity is stronger, the orbiting object will eventually spiral in and crash into the center object.  If gravity is weaker, the object will travel further away until it leaves the range of gravitational pull.  While this is happening, because of the nature of the forces, the object will orbit around the center.  And that's what we see in the demonstration, in simple terms at least. ",
