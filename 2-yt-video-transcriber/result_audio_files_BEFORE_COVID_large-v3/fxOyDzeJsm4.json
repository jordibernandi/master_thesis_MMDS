            "text": "Hi folks, I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  Welcome to the 2019 Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo.  It's Monday, July 15.  The event is steer roping.  In the next few hours, five animals will be injured so badly they'll have to be slutted out.  Five lives snuffed out for a morning of entertainment for sadists masquerading as cowboys.  Rodeos maim and kill untold numbers of animals across the nation annually.  Incredibly, rodeos will often take a break in the performance to parade animals into the arena while praising them as quote, animal athletes.  We couldn't crown champions and give you big numbers without amazing animal athletes.  At one point, Andy Stewart, the announcer, says this.  Ladies and gentlemen, animal welfare, safety, and health is the number one priority of professional rodeo.  Sure it is, Andy.  Sure it is.  Claiming proper treatment and care for rodeo animals is a recurrent theme that is echoed on the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo's website, as well as many other rodeo websites, and on the website of the Cheyenne Rodeo's sanctioning body, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, or the PRCA.  This is self-serving propaganda intended to make weak-minded fools ignore the obvious animal abuse they see with their own eyes.  For those with more than a single-digit IQ, the cruelty of the rodeo is obvious.  There were several instances of animals fleeing their tormentors and falling after a ride.  Just listen to the announcer's comment as these events unfold.  Additionally, a steer was injured during the team roping event.  and was forced to limp out of the arena.  Please do not attend the Cheyenne Frontier Days or any other rodeo.  And please do not do business with rodeo sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Polaris, and Wrangler.  I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  Before we go, we're adding this message to each video that exposes a PRCA-sanctioned rodeo.  And because the PRCA is the largest rodeo association, that's most of them.  We have on numerous occasions tried to bring specific concerns and allegations of abuse to George Taylor, the Commissioner of the PRCA.  These include the brutal abuse of steer busting, the disappearing of injured rodeo animals, the shocking of rodeo animals, and other cruelty.  The concerns and allegations are founded on decades of video documentation and in some cases on official government records, all of which we have placed in the public domain for all to see.  That Commissioner Taylor will not respond to the evidence leads to just one conclusion, that Mr.  Taylor understands that the weight of the evidence is overwhelming and that there is no defense for the abuse, and most disturbingly, that Mr.  Taylor, his administration, and the PRCA generally has absolutely no intention to change a thing.  We find Mr.  Taylor's determined indifference to be repulsive, no honor or dignity whatsoever.  Corporate sponsors, supporters in the media, and of course those in the stands share in the cruelty, corruption, and cowardice.  Mr.  Taylor, you have a standing invitation to come out of your hole, step into the light, and man up.  I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness. ",
