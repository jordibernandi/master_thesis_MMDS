            "text": "Hey y'all, just wanted to pop in real quick and give the world what I know they've been clamoring for, a straight white man's opinion on abortion.  In case you missed it, Alabama just passed a historically restrictive abortion law that comes as close as possible to outright banning the practice in their state.  And it's just such a shame, man, because, you know, in my opinion, if any baby deserves an opportunity to not be born, it's one that's about to be born in fucking Alabama.  No, I'm kidding, except I'm not really.  Fucking sucks to be a kid in Alabama.  They're 50th in education, so all their kids get off to a pretty rocky start.  If you're a poor kid there, they want to take your mama's food stamps away.  If you're a brown kid there, they want to kick you out or lock you in a fucking cage.  If you're a gay or transgender kid there, they'll call you an abomination to your face.  You can say what you want about Alabama, but they're pretty consistent with how much they clearly hate children.  Which kind of makes this law make sense if you think about it.  Because after all, if you don't force more pregnancies to be carried to term there, how are you supposed to brutally oppress those children after they're born?  No, but this new law is truly crazy, man.  They don't even have any exceptions for rape or incest.  And with the latter, I assume that's because these lawmakers realized if they allowed abortions in cases of incest in Alabama, they wouldn't have any babies left to be born.  Am I right?  You know, because we all fuck our sisters and stuff.  No, I don't think that one's going to come up too much, really.  But the rape part, Horrible.  Under this new law, a girl could theoretically get raped, have an abortion, and then she could go to prison for longer than the dude that fucking raped her.  What the fuck, man?  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's like, quit stealing all her moves.  But no, it's horrific, and I don't even know what their justification for it is.  You know, I mean, I guess if you asked them, the lawmakers would say, well, I mean, you know, if a girl gets raped, she can just go two or three states over and get an abortion.  I mean, that's what I forced my daughter to do when she was about to have that black baby, and it turned out fine.  Now, I don't know why we're so insane about abortion in the South.  I'm just kidding.  I do know why.  It starts with a G and ends with odd damn stupid ass Bible.  But I also think it's like a marketing thing.  Because I know growing up there, you can't go 10 miles without seeing a pro-life propaganda of some sort.  You never see pro-choice shit.  But, I mean, really, I get it.  What would that even look like, you know?  Because all the pro-life billboards, they're all the same thing.  It's all the fattest, cutest, most precious, very white baby that's clearly not old enough to talk, but still has like a speech bubble beside its head that says some crazy shit on it.  that typically amounts to, imagine if I was dead.  Are you sad yet?  Vote for God.  They've got their formula down, is what I'm saying.  What are we gonna put on a pro-choice billboard, man?  What, are we gonna have a picture of a teenage girl not crying herself to sleep, still having hopes and dreams and shit?  How do you capture that in a photograph, you know?  No, I'm just kidding.  They don't give a fuck about teenage girls.  They don't give a fuck about any women, man.  Honestly, I don't think they really give a fuck about the issue, even.  I think these assholes just see an opportunity.  Now that Trump has stacked the Supreme Court deck with all his he-man-woman haters, they think this is their time.  to take a shot at Roe v. Wade.  Maybe they'll be the guy that gets it overturned, you know, and then they can etch their names in history alongside such like-minded luminaries as Jefferson Davis and George Wallace and that dude that killed them trees over a football game.  You can't put a price on immortality, you know?  Yeah, that's what they're doing, but I also believe that they will ultimately fail, because I have faith that smarter people than me at the ACLU and their ilk will find a way to ensure that this shit ultimately does not work.  Because, I mean, if you think about it, man, if history's shown us anything, it's that in the state of Alabama, the only thing they do better on a grand scale than ruin college football is start a war over some morally reprehensible shit and then lose in spectacular fashion.  So, fingers crossed.  And to all my like-minded brothers and sisters in Alabama, I just want to let you know, I know you're there.  I'm sorry you have to put up with this shit and just... Stay the course and I'll see you soon.  That's right, on a final note, I'm not going to boycott Alabama or nothing like that for two reasons.  First, the people that come see me in Alabama, they hate this law more than anybody.  You know, and I know that.  I don't want to fuck them over.  But also, number two, if you're a major act like Springsteen or an industry or something, you could send a real message with a boycott like that.  But what message am I sending to these lawmakers in Alabama by not showing up?  What's my message?  Happy fucking birthday.  You're welcome.  They don't want me there, man.  The best thing I can do to piss them off is to show my ass up and keep running my godless mouth.  So that's what I'm going to do, Alabama.  I'll see you in June.  I still love you. ",
