            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  We are witnessing the steady erosion of Donald Trump's grasp on the power of his presidency.  There still remains a number of steps before he's gone, and many of those steps involve the investigatory process, which has only just gotten underway in the House via the official impeachment inquiry.  Another critical step in the process is to garner some Republican support.  And this is going to be the toughest step of them all, mainly due to the fact that Republicans have proven themselves to be shameless patsies for Donald Trump.  Up to this point, they've been willing, if not eager, to ignore and cover for his disregard for the rule of law, disrespect for his oath of office, and contempt for the restrictions placed on him by the Constitution of the United States.  Almost every single one of them is quaking in their loafers, terrified that a poorly written tweet from this mentally defective game show host might be directed at them.  There are, however, cracks that are beginning to develop in the Republican wall of complicity.  And I'm going to talk about them in a moment.  But first, I want to discuss what it is that is forcing them to face facts and warm to the idea of impeaching and removing Donald Trump from the White House.  there is a crumbling of the normally hardened facade of lies and distortion that comes from the usual suspects who make up the front lines of the Trump disinformation operation.  Just this weekend, in fact, both Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pompeo blew it, outing themselves as the hapless goons they've always been.  Mulvaney, who's like if Harry Potter grew up to be a dick, appeared on Fox News Sunday this weekend with Chris Wallace where he embarrassed himself like a pro.  Well, like a pro if it was a competition for shamefulness.  He dodged and weaved and fumbled his way through attempting to deny the fact that only hours before he admitted to a quid pro quo related to the withholding of crucial military aid to Ukraine political rival, which absolutely constitutes asking a foreign power to interfere in our democracy.  Prepare yourself for all of the cringe. ",

There were two reasons that we held up the aid.  We've talked about this at some length.  The first one was the rampant corruption in Ukraine.  Ukraine, by the way, Chris, is so bad in Ukraine that in 2014 Congress passed a law requiring us to make sure that corruption was moving in the right direction.  So corruption is a big deal.  Everybody knows it.  The president was also concerned about whether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine as well.  We've talked about that for quite a while now.  I did then mention that in the past, the president had mentioned for me to time to time about the DNC server.  He'd mentioned the DNC server to other people publicly.  He even mentioned it to President Zelensky in the phone call.  But it wasn't connected to the aid, and that's where I think people got sidetracked this weekend at that press conference.  Two reasons for holding back the aid. ",

It must be a bummer for Donald Trump's White House chief of staff to go on Donald Trump's favorite channel expecting a spa day and instead getting treated to an oncoming train.  Anyone else in Mick Mulvaney's position would be running for the exits right now in anticipation of the many indictments that are sure to come from this, especially considering that John Bolton, who is a radical right-wing conservative nutter, Not some deep state operative.  Even John Bolton wanted nothing to do with this corrupt Donald Trump Ukraine operation.  Telling a colleague to go to the White House lawyers about it.  The New York Times reports, Mr.  Bolton got into a tense exchange on July 10th with Gordon D. Sunderland, the Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union.  who is working with Rudolph Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to three people who heard the testimony.  The aide, Fiona Hill, testified that Mr.  Bolton told her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr.  Sondland, Mr.  Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, according to people familiar with the testimony.  Quote, I am not part of whatever drug deal Songlin and Mulvaney are cooking up.  Mr.  Bolton, a Yale-trained lawyer, told Ms.  Hill to tell White House lawyers, according to two people at the deposition.  Listen, you know it's a bad sitch when even John Bolton is slowly backing out of the room with his hands in the air.  And this is only what we know right now.  The House impeachment inquiry is only weeks old.  There is so much more to uncover, and people are seeming eager to get themselves before Congress to tell them what they know, even if that means defying the orders of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has instructed his State Department officials to disregard congressional requests and subpoenas.  and wrote Congress telling them, I'm concerned with aspects of the committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully and treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career Foreign Service officers whom the committee is now targeting.  Also writing, let me be clear, I will not tolerate such tactics and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals who I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.  Well, this writer of fiery letters also appeared yesterday with George Stephanopoulos and wasn't nearly as fiery or confident.  In fact, watch Pompeo try to bob and weave only to end up with his back on the canvas.  And pay particular attention to the oh fuck.  moment where a cogent answer was replaced with a blank stupid stare and almost four full seconds of excruciating silence while he desperately tried and failed to come up with an answer about the clear and admitted quid pro quo from Donald Trump to the Ukrainian president.
