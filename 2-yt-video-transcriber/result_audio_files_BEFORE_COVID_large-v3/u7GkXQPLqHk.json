            "text": "Greetings, my friends.  I'm going mobile today.  So many big, huge end time signs happening everywhere.  The biggest end time signs of them all is the convergence of all the signs that we're having right now.  Let's go over the signs that are happening right now in front of our faces.  Israel, everything possible imaginable.  Israel is happening right now at this very second.  It's happening everywhere.  Israel's being threatened by all sides of her enemies, Psalm 83 war.  She's being threatened by Russia, by Turkey, by Iran, Gog Magog war.  She's being threatened by Syria and she'll have to end up destroying Damascus, Isaiah 17 prophecy.  All of the third temple is ready to be built.  They're demanding it be built.  Everything is in line.  All of the preparation for the temple is ready.  All the artifacts are found, including the Ark of the Covenant.  The Jewish rabbis claim to have that as well.  Prophecy fulfilled.  Jews coming back to Israel in record numbers.  Prophecy fulfilled.  The entire world being blessed by Israel.  All the amazing things Israel has done technologically is here right now.  Prophecy fulfilled.  The Dead Sea coming alive again.  Prophecy fulfilled.  All the oil and natural gas being found in Israel.  The hook that's going to draw Gog of Magog, Putin of Russia down in the Gog-Magog war.  Prophecy fulfilled.  Israel is just the desert blooming and making huge fruit and vegetables to be imported everywhere in a flowering, beautiful place.  Prophecy fulfilled.  It's happening so fast.  It's unbelievable how fast it's happening in Israel.  It just goes on and on and on and on and on.  You've got wars and rumors of wars around the entire world.  You've got volcanoes and earthquakes erupting, getting ready to erupt in record numbers.  You've got all kinds of evil and hatred and anger and filth and nastiness and perversion and babies being slaughtered in the womb and just all kinds of horrible things happening in the world everywhere.  you've got man turning against man.  you've got the whole world in a huge uproar.  the devil is is on a rampage.  he's down on earth right now tearing things apart but he's just getting started.  this is nothing appearing.  how it's going to be soon in the tribulation and great tribulation.  this is all prophecy 101 fulfillment my friends.  it's amazing how fast things happen.  it's incredible how things are happening so quickly.  it's incredible How the Bible is just being shown to be to be proven to be true as it always is.  It's happening so fast, happening so rapidly everywhere.  And very few can see it because they're spiritually blind or they just don't care.  The church is just a weak, watered down, toothless, gutless, spineless, saltless, lightless joke.  for the most part, and it's pathetic.  They don't lead anyone to Christ.  They lead people away from Christ.  They're evil and wicked tons more than the world as a whole is.  It's just terrible how bad things are happening.  It's terrible how things are falling apart.  And the world, again, just can't see it.  The church can't see it.  I am just so sickened and so heartbroken and so sad and so sorrowful and just so broken to see how the church has become, how the world has become.  And I pray for everybody every day, man.  I pray for the world.  I pray for those who are lost without Jesus Christ.  I pray for those who are backslidden, though they don't believe it.  There are hundreds of scriptures in the Bible that prove that you have to repent of your sins after you're saved.  If you don't believe that, you're left behind, then that's on you.  I can't help you anymore.  If you believe in the rapture anymore, if you don't believe in the pre-trib rapture, when it happens, if you're left behind, you aren't ready, don't blame me.  I've warned you.  I'm just so sad.  My heart's just broken.  I've asked Christ for years now to give me his heart for the lost and his love for mankind as much as I can handle and help me lead at least one person back to him or to him every day.  He's honored that request.  He's helped me just to lead endless people to him, back to him, all for him, all through him, all for his glory, nothing to do with me.  I just can't tell you enough how we have to get ready.  We have to understand where we're at.  We have to just prepare ourselves to be either raptured or left behind.  There's no middle ground.  There's no two ways about it.  You've got to do what you've got to do.  And it just breaks my heart again to see so few are ready, so few care, so few have a clue about what's going on.  All the prophecy in the Bible that has to happen before the imminent rapture has happened.  I think our believer was waiting on God, his number of Gentiles to fill that ark that's going to heaven and to get us ready like in Noah's day.  He spared Noah's family in the ark from the great flood.  He'll spare the true Christians in the ark that goes up in the rapture.  And When that last Gentile is saved, we're out of here and there won't be any time for a do-over, no time for a timeout.  It'll be just horrendous.  All the babies and little ones disappear.  They'll be glad Christians like me are gone.  When their babies and little ones are gone, all their loved ones who are Christians, graves are burst open and they're gone.  They're going to start freaking out to the max.  It's going to be breaking news everywhere.  There won't be any regular news.  Breaking news will be the news of the day.  It'll be just insane how terrifying and gut-wrenching and sad and heartbreaking things will be.  You think that depression and anxiety is bad right now?  It's nothing compared to what's about to come down the pike.  And very few are ready to go, my friends.  And then after that, seven pure years of hell where God reigns righteous judgment and Satan and the Antichrist and false prophet reign unrighteous judgment.  And this world will be ripped to pieces.  And God said, if he didn't intervene, no flesh remain alive as it is.  Billions and billions and billions will die the most grotesque, awful, horrific deaths imaginable man.  Just billions dying from an asteroid, billions dying from plague, pestilence and disease, billions dying from a huge 200 million army coming down from China.  The sun's so hot it'll kill you, make you wish you were dead.  Demonic insects sting you for months at a time.  You want to die and you can't.  100-pound hailstones falling out of the sky, crushing and just... If you find Jesus Christ during the tribulation, you'll be hunted down like a wild animal, hungry, thirsty, homeless, jobless, suffering.  You'll be captured, you'll be tortured, have your head chopped off.  It's going to be bad, my friends.  It's going to be an awful, awful, awful, awful, awful time.  There's no reason to go through all that.  Why would you?  Jesus Christ is our only hope.  If you've never been saved, be your backslidden.  Pray the prayer.  Do the six steps I have in the box below the video.  No one's guaranteed the next day, hour, minute, or second of your life.  If you'd like prayer for anything, contact me.  I pray for you every day without fail.  True Christians, witness and pray for the lost daily.  It's your job.  If you're not doing it, do it now.  If you are, great.  and look up our different draw tonight.  We fly soon.  I love you all so much, and I'll pray for you.  Just ask me to.  I don't want to see anyone spend forever in hell in the lake of fire.  You guys take care of yourself.  Share this video.  Share it again.  Share it again.  Share it again.  Have everyone you know share it.  Take care of yourselves.  I love you.  We fly soon. ",
