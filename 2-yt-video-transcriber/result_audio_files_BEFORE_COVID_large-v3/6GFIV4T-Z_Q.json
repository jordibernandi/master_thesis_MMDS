            "text": "Finally, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a man allowed his eight-year-old daughter to take the wheel of his car, and an accident ensued that damaged seven other cars and injured six people, which once again proves my theory.  Women can't drive.  Safer drivers, men or women?  Well, according to a new survey, 55% of adults feel that women are most responsible for minor fender benders, while 78% blame men for most fatal crashes.  Please note that the percentage in these pie graphs do not add up to 100% because the math was done by a woman.  For those of you hissing at that joke, it should be noted that that joke was written by a woman.  So, now you don't know what the hell to do.  No, I'm just kidding.  We don't hire women.  A celebrated fertility statue, which many believe has the power to make women pregnant, began a nationwide tour this week.  The hundreds of women who claim it caused their pregnancies are of different ages, races, and religions.  But they all have one thing in common.  They are all dirty, dirty whores.  A new book claims that Madonna once smeared peanut butter all over John F. Kennedy  Jr.'s  body and then licked it up.  Which just goes to show you, Madonna's a whore.  In other show business news, it has been reported that superstar Madonna is pregnant.  Although, personally, I find this a bit hard to believe.  I mean, Madonna isn't even married. ",

            "text": "And finally, Weekend Update would like to congratulate Madonna, who gave birth to a beautiful baby girl last Monday.  The baby weighed in at six pounds, nine ounces, making it the fourth largest object ever to pass through Madonna's birth canal.  I like that Madonna's baby thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, I really have to give it to that guy.  that's the father, you know?  Carlos... Leon.  Carlos Leon.  Or Carlos Leon, I forget which one.  Because you've got to have a lot of guts.  That means he had sex with Madonna without a condom.  That's great.  Pop singer Madonna was outraged this week when a tabloid photographer snapped her picture while she was breastfeeding her new baby.  Apparently, the baby was blocking her nipple.  Well, filming has finally begun in the long-awaited life story of Evita Peron, starring pop singer Madonna.  According to its producers, the film is 100% historically accurate, except for the part where Mrs.  Peron has group sex with the Houston Rockets.  Texas millionaire J. Howard Marshall may have died two months ago, but as we see here, he and wife Anna Nicole Smith can still enjoy a romantic evening at home.  Former Playboy centerfold and guest jeans model Anna Nicole Smith collapsed this week after she suddenly realized that she actually had sex with this guy.  And finally, in entertainment news, ex-Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole Smith has filed for bankruptcy.  And saddest of all, she slept with this guy for nothing.  Well, the Learning Annex in New York is offering a new course to teach women how to smoke cigars.  The fee to enroll in the class is $100.  The fee to watch the class is $200.  According to a new study from Yale University, in order to duplicate the physique of a Barbie doll, the average woman would have to grow to seven feet, add five inches to her bust, and trim six inches from her waist.  So ladies, you have your mission.  Now get to it.  Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown has written a book describing in lurid detail exactly what she did with Hugh Grant.  The book sells for $25, but for $35, she'll show you.  Former British cavalry officer James Hewitt, who was Lady Diana's secret lover, says he will never ever disclose the contents of more than 100 love letters that she sent to him.  This according to Hewitt's new book, I Banged a Princess.  Under a new ordinance, exotic, nude, and topless dancing will be banned in any establishment selling alcoholic beverages in the city of New Iberia, Louisiana.  Or as I now refer to it, the most horrible place on earth.  Exotic dancers say city ordinance requiring them to keep four feet away from their customers will put them out of business in shoreline Washington, or as I now refer to it, Nazi Germany.  In sports, distance runner Jutta Pippig set a record by winning her third consecutive Boston Marathon, despite suffering from both her period and diarrhea.  throughout the 26-mile run.  In addition, Pippig also set a record for causing the most spectators to make this face... at a Boston Marathon.  Well, Jocelyn Elder's new book, Jocelyn Elder's MD, came out this week.  I read it.  After closing out a successful first season, the WNBA is considering several changes to improve the level of play in the league next year.  Among the proposals, extending the playoffs, increasing salaries, bringing back the three-point line, and replacing all the female players with guys.  The WNBA officials expanded to 10 teams this week, adding franchises in Detroit and Washington, D.C.  But before you get too excited about the new additions to the league, remember, all of the players are still women.  They stink at basketball, that's the problem.  Other than that, it'd be a good, you know, good game, but... The next time I watch a WNBA game will be the first time I watch a WNBA game.  Hey, WNBA, I got an idea that'll sell some tickets, shirts and skins.  It was a bad week for the restaurant chain Hooters.  The company has been forced to pay $3.75 million to settle a sex discrimination suit brought by male job applicants who claim that its policy of hiring only women is unfair.  The settlement was hailed as a landmark case for guys who try to ruin everything.  According to a new survey by the Women's Vote Project, women would be more likely to vote if they could send in ballots by mail or if polls were open longer.  Also, more women would vote if you were permitted to bake your vote.  They like to bake.  I'm thankful for women, Conan.  Oh, there you go.  The greatest creatures on earth.  That's all right.  We'll get behind that one.  I think women are more intelligent than men. ",
