So if we don't say the word pull that means that things don't actually fall towards the ground.  Now it is all a bit of semantics.  We do know that non-contact forces will bring objects together and that isn't going to be changed whether you describe something as a pull or a push.  But anyway it seems like a few beers and a bit of high IQ research.  later Dell's changed his mind.  Now, I think that might be my favourite Del clip of all time.  What do you think, buddy?  Del?  Del?  Oh, come on, don't be like that, man.  You're going to embarrass me in front of these guys.

So I guess it's time that I did something vaguely scientific and I'm going to see if I can explain the cause of the tides to you in 45 seconds or less.  There is a more detailed video.  I've linked in the description on the BaldiCats channel where I spend about 10 minutes talking about it.  I want to thank Jen Morgan for the graphic for Del's Bar.  I really, really appreciate that.  The second half of this video will be coming out tomorrow or the day after.  The video would have been about 25 minutes if I had put it all together and I didn't want to bore you.  So the second half should be done soon.  That'll have all the chat box travels, the comments, etc.  So, can I explain the tides in 45 seconds or less?  Here we go.  Here is the Moon, here is the Earth.  Now, the Earth experiences a gravitational pull from the Moon, which is greater on this side than it is in the centre or on this side.  And what that means is the water on the right-hand side is accelerating greater than the centre of the Earth, which is accelerating greater than the water on the left-hand side.  And some people think that this is the reason for the two bulges which cause the tide.  But it's only partially the reason.  You see, the Earth's own gravitational pull is accelerating all the water towards the centre of the Earth.  And the combination of those accelerations means that the water in the north and south, as you can see on this picture, actually wants to move in this direction.  But it can't move in that direction because the Earth itself is also experiencing that acceleration towards the moon.  And what that actually causes is a pressure in the northern and southern hemisphere that helps contribute to that tidal bulge.  Now, I don't know if I've explained that in 45 seconds.  If I wasn't very clear, do check out the link on the BaldiCats channel where it's broken down step by step.  Thanks for watching and keep your eye out for the chat box travels.  video coming up very soon.  Cats, cats, conspiracy cats. ",
