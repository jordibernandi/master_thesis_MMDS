            "text": "Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  So before the previous hearing, I sent out letters to all five of the private housing companies that testified two weeks ago.  to get some more data and background information on what was going on.  They have since provided my office with the requested documents that I'd asked for in this letter.  And representatives from three of those companies have met with my staff to explain how their business model works.  The companies summarized 600-page complex secret financial agreements into a single PowerPoint slide that clearly laid out how they actually don't make much money and they only receive their fees after setting aside money for operating and maintenance expenses.  Meanwhile, they also claimed that because people don't have to live on base, they are properly incentivized to provide Excellent service.  If you believe the companies, it all makes sense on paper.  The market works perfectly.  They said, in effect, there's no problem.  The incentives are all working.  The market works.  Nothing to see here.  So let me just start by asking Secretary Spencer, Esper, and Wilson, do you agree that the housing market for base housing is working properly?  Would you like to start, Secretary Esper? ",

Enforcement, not just signing the contract, but enforcing the contract is absolutely critical.  So I just want to dig down on one part of that and on some reports of potential fraud.  The committee has received reports from military families who are being charged for things like carpet replacement upon moving out, but the carpets are not actually replaced.
