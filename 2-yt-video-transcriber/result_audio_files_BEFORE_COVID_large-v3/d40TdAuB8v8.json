            "text": "Hey family, it's your girl T, aka the nappy-headed jojoba, here today with just a quick video.  It's gonna be quick.  Just a little tip slash hack slash technique for attaching beads to your braids or twists without using rubber bands.  A lot of you guys have been saying that you like my little protective style that I've got going right now.  Thank you so much for all the kind comments.  It's just, you know, your typical donut bun.  As many of you guys know, I like to leave my edges out of it in terms of pulling my hair back 95% of the time because I don't really have edges.  So the little bit that I do have, I want to preserve.  And in leaving them out, I've been trying to come up with ways to keep it cute.  Now, I actually used to pretty much always have beads in my hair as a little girl when my mom was doing my hair.  And she would attach the beads not using rubber bands, but she would use tinfoil.  That's right, tin foil.  To this day, I still kinda can't believe she would do me like that.  But luckily, at one point, we stumbled across these little things that I have in my hair right now, and you will see them more closely in a moment in the demo, that allowed her to secure the beads onto my braids without using rubber bands, because even when you get the no-snag rubber bands, I just don't personally think that that's the gentlest way to secure beads.  I really don't wanna put rubber bands in my hair.  Once I was old enough to tell my mom that I didn't want to walk around looking like an insane person with tinfoil in my hair, my mom wound up finding these little things on Jamaica Avenue.  I'm from Queens in case you didn't know.  So she just found these little things at a beauty supply store in Queens.  I was unable to find them in LA and I actually have already forgotten what they're called, but they are available on the internet.  Thank you, internet.  and they allow me to secure my beads onto.  what I have are flat twists here, not cornrows because I am cornrow challenged, without using tin foil and without using rubber bands.  So let's get into this demo. ",

            "text": "First off, you're going to need a beader tool.  These generally come in the pack with the beads.  Alternatively, you can use a latch hook or even a hairpin, which I prefer because it snags my hair less than the beader.  Obviously, you're going to need some beads.  These are some pretty wooden ones I have.  However, I don't like to use these because as you can see, the inside, the opening of the bead is very jagged.  I even see some splinters in there, and I certainly don't want that on my hair.  Instead, I'll be using these plastic beads.  Here's a black one in sort of an antique brass looking situation.  So this is what I'm going to use.  And the piece de resistance is this little gold leaf thingy.  This is what I use to attach the beads and make sure they don't go falling off of my braids.  I'm just getting some sealants on my ends, just reapplying.  My ends had already been sealed, but I was just adding a little bit more because I'm anal retentive.  And here I am just showing you guys how you can use a latch hook to attach beads to your hair if you don't have a beater or if you're like me and you just don't like those cheap plastic beaters that always get caught on my hair.  Now that the beads are on, I'm ready for my little gold leaf thingy and I just need to wrap my ends around it like such as and just wind and wind.  Now in this situation, I'm actually wrapping more hair around this one than I would recommend. ",

            "text": "My right side used to be shaved so that hangs a lot shorter and this is my left side that I'm showing you.  so I need to fake it being shorter than the other.  So I've wrapped all the hair on, and now all I have to do is bend the leaf.  Booyah.  And again, I don't recommend putting this much hair on there, but I'm trying to fake a shorter length.  So once that's done, you just slide the beads down, and make sure you have beads that are not too large in their opening for the leaf, and they will stay just like this.  I also feel like this looks a lot nicer than the rubber band method.  Just showing you again now on my right side, which is my shorter side, so I won't need to wrap as much hair around the gold leaf.  So I probably did the last inch and a half to two inches of my hair, fold it over just like on the other side, and it folds a lot easier because there isn't too much hair jammed on it.  And then you slide the beads down to cover that up.  And that's E. We're good. ",

            "text": "really, really simple.  I like that unlike with the rubber band method, not only am I avoiding that rubber band potentially damaging the very ends of my hair, I'm also keeping the ends of my hair stretched by wrapping them around the little gold leaf thingies.  And I actually really like having the beads on the ends of my hair because one, they help to elongate my hair a bit, which helps to keep it more stretched.  And two, it is literally protecting my ends, which is great because we're in a protect your ends challenge.  You know, my ends are completely concealed inside the beads on the last inch to two inches, which is nice, but that's it.  Just a quick tip for those of you who were looking for a way to secure beads to braids or twists and didn't want to use rubber bands because I can't take credit for this tip.  This is again, my mom's idea.  She did it on my hair when I was a little girl and I just couldn't find these little thingies that I needed at any beauty supply stores here in LA, nor could I find other options for attaching beads to braids without using rubber bands.  because I did do some Googling, and I didn't really find anything, and that is why I wanted to make this video, in case someone else maybe was searching for a way and wasn't finding any ideas.  For me, what it came down to was going back to an old idea, my mom's idea, and just actually being able to hunt down the little doohickeys that I needed to achieve it.  That is going to do it for this one, but thank you so much for watching.  I hope this was helpful, and I will see you guys in the next vidya.  Buh-bye. ",
