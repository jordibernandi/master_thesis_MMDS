            "text": "The Book of Sirach, Chapter 13.  Whoever touches tar gets dirty, and whoever associates with an arrogant person becomes like him.  Don't pick up anything that is too heavy for you, or associate with anyone who is richer or more powerful than you.  Why put a clay pot next to an iron kettle?  The clay pot may hit it and shatter.  A rich person does wrong and then adds insult to injury.  A poor person is wronged and has to apologize for being wronged.  A rich person will exploit you if you can be of use to him, but he will leave you if you are in need.  He will live with you as long as you have nice things.  He will take everything you have without any regret.  When he needs something from you, he will deceive you by smiling at you and flattering you.  He will compliment you and ask you what you need.  He will embarrass you at his dinner parties until he has taken everything you have two or three times.  Finally, he will mock you.  Later when he sees you in need, he will leave you and shake his head in disgust at you.  Be careful that you are not misled or humiliated by your own stupidity.  When a powerful person invites you somewhere, be reluctant.  Then he will encourage you even more to accept his invitation.  Don't be pushy or else you may be pushed aside.  Don't appear aloof or else you will be forgotten.  Don't try to talk to a powerful person like an equal or believe anything he says.  He will test you with lengthy conversations.  He will be studying you while he is smiling at you.  The person who doesn't keep your secrets is cruel.  He will not keep you from being harmed or imprisoned.  Be on your guard.  Be very careful because you are walking into disaster.  All creatures love their own kind.  and all people love people who are like themselves.  All animals gather with their own kind, and people stick close to those like themselves.  Wolves have nothing in common with lambs.  Likewise, sinners have nothing in common with devout people.  Peace cannot exist between hyenas and dogs.  Likewise, Peace can't exist between rich people and poor people.  Wild donkeys in the wilderness are prey for lions.  Likewise, poor people are prey for rich people.  Humility is disgusting to arrogant people.  Likewise, poor people are disgusting to rich people.  When a rich person stumbles, his friends will help support him.  But when a humble person falls, his friends will ignore him.  When a rich person makes a mistake, many come to his rescue.  Even if he says something outrageous, they praise him for it.  When a humble person makes a mistake, people criticize him.  Even if what he says makes sense, they won't listen to him.  When a rich person speaks, people become silent.  They praise what he has said to high heaven.  When a poor person speaks, they ask, who do you think you are?  If he stumbles, they will push him down.  Wealth is good if it is free from sin.  Poverty is considered evil only by unbelievers.  A person's attitude makes the expression on his face change, either for good or for bad.  A cheerful face is a sign of happiness.  Painstaking thought creates proverbs. ",
