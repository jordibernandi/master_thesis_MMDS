And there's so much to get to since we last spoke, but including oil.  But I want to start by getting your take on the latest Federal Reserve news breaking Tuesday afternoon.  An interest rate cut is, of course, expected at this week's open market committee.  Seems like a fait accompli.  But in the meantime, the Wall Street Journal says the Fed reportedly had to take action to keep the federal funds rate in their target range with $53 billion in repurchase agreements.  Fox Business and other outlets say it was closer to a $75 billion intervention.  Diagram the mechanism of this intervention for us, and what are the implications of this Fed action moving forward? ",

            "text": "Well, first of all, I think the financial media and Wall Street is being much too complacent about what's happening.  And their instinct is to sweep it under the rug as no big deal.  But I think it really is the harbinger of what's to come.  Because the Federal Reserve has been artificially suppressing interest rates, particularly since the 2008 financial crisis.  And by keeping interest rates artificially low, They have created a bubble that's much bigger than the one that popped in 2008.  And what happened this morning is that you can see the air coming out of that bubble because the market is trying to bring interest rates higher because we have no real savings in this country.  We have enormous debt.  Everybody is levered up to the max, government, the private sector, business, consumers.  Because rates have been so low, we've borrowed so much money.  The market wants interest rates to be higher.  but the Fed doesn't want to allow that to happen because the road back to normal interest rates is a very bumpy one because it's going to take us right through another financial crisis.  So the Fed is trying to keep interest rates artificially low, and they almost lost control of it this morning.  Now, you know, they created, what, $50, $70 billion out of thin air to supply the credit that the market needed.  But what happens next time?  What happens if we need $100 billion?  What happens if we need a trillion?  Because eventually we will.  Eventually the Fed has to choose between destroying the dollar and allowing the market to bring interest rates to a level that makes sense for an economy with this much debt, and then all hell breaks loose because we have a much worse financial crisis than the one we had in 08.  Hmm. ",

And on the Fed's FMOC meeting coming up, you've been in the consensus that pretty much everyone expects another rate is coming, but you think that's definitely not a good thing in your view.  What are your thoughts right now as they prepare to go further into arguably unprecedented territory for monetary policy this week? ",

            "text": "well yeah the fed definitely should not be cutting interest rates now the economy is going into a recession but the cure for what ails us is not lower interest rates.  we need to go through this recession and higher interest rates are part of the cleansing process as painful as that process is now going to be.  but the federal reserve has no stomach for doing what's right.  So they will cut interest rates because that's what the addicts on Wall Street demand.  So we're not going to have a real recovery.  We're just going to try to maintain this bubble.  But I don't think it's going to work.  I mean, I do think the Fed is going back to zero.  I think they're going back to quantitative easing.  They may even go negative.  Who knows?  They're going to put everything out there, including the kitchen sink, to try to prevent interest rates from rising, to try to prevent this bubble from deflating.  But they are going to fail. ",

            "text": "well we just discussed it a little bit earlier today.  as far as in the in the short end but you know i am expecting a more violent move from the long end of the bond market.  i mean that is where the biggest part of the bubble is.  i mean thirty-year u.s.  treasuries are barely above two percent.  mean who in their right mind would loan government the u.s.  government money for thirty years?  you're not getting your money back for thirty years And all you're going to get is 2% coupons for the next 30 years waiting to get repaid.  Look at the price of gold moving above $1,500.  That's a very good sign that the people who are waiting to get their money back 30 years from now aren't going to get very much of anything as far as purchasing power.  So that is where the real danger is when the long end of the market really starts to implode.  And, you know, that could happen any day.  I mean, it probably won't happen tomorrow, but one of these days it will happen tomorrow. ",

Three more traders in their metals desk, including the former head of the desk, were charged with spoofing.  fraudulent and deceptive orders to manipulate metals prices between 2008 and 2016, and they were charged under the U.S.  RICO statute, which is an organized crime law, which is interesting.  They also face a federal class action lawsuit over their actions in Silver's futures.  Has this story of market manipulation played out within the sector or at J.P.  Morgan, or could we see more similar scandals in the future? ",

            "text": "Well, you know, I don't know, and I know a lot of people in the gold market have long believed that it was manipulation that was responsible for the suppression of the price of gold, that somehow gold would have been much higher, but for manipulation of banks like JP Morgan, and maybe some of those people are feeling vindicated based on this news.  But I don't think this type of manipulation is what those people had in mind when they were thinking about keeping the prices of gold and silver down.  I mean, I don't know that that was the goal of the manipulation.  it seems like they were just manipulating markets to try to make more profits for themselves and i don't know that they cared which direction the market moved as long as they made money off of those movements and so they tried to manipulate the markets to their own advantage.  i don't think this is why the price of gold is not much higher.  i think it's not much higher because Too many investors don't understand what's going on.  They have confidence in the Federal Reserve, other central banks.  They believe in this bubble.  They are as fooled now as they were going into the 2008 financial crisis.  The difference was they were bailed out last time.  As wrong as all the experts were on Wall Street and other countries who couldn't see an obvious crisis coming, when they were blindsided, their pals at the Federal Reserve and other central banks were able to bail them out.  It's not going to work this time.  It doesn't mean the central banks won't try.  But as I said, it won't succeed.  They're going to destroy the dollar in the process, maybe bring down the entire fiat monetary system.  And gold is already rising.  Gold is telling you that on the ashes of this old system, we are going to resurrect the gold standard, because that's what we had prior to the dollar taking over.  We had a much sounder monetary system then.  We had a more viable global economy.  Once we took the money out of the economy, once we substituted real money for fiat, that was the beginning of these problems.  And the end of these problems is going to be returning to honest money, which is gold.  And to go from here to there, there's a lot of problems that are going to come to the surface.  There's a lot of defaults and bankruptcies.  But at the end of this tunnel, there's a lot of light.  But hopefully, we can avoid the oncoming train. ",
