            "text": "The housing crash is coming.  Let's have a look.  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to another episode of Highest Says.  I've got my coffee and I thought we would start the day with some good old-fashioned housing price crash fearmongering.  This is another article from Frank Cheng from news.com.  Let the bloodbath begin.  House prices in Sydney and Melbourne could half in worst crash since the 1890s.  Now, let's jump here.  to this little diagram to give us an understanding of the changes in property values in the 1890s.  Now they've got two little lines on here.  The light grey one is the 1930s, the depression.  Okay, the big depression.  And you can see that fall down to here.  The index of 80 out of 100.  So the 1892 value was 100.  On the 1930 value, it was 100.  This is the drop that happened after.  So it went down 20 relative to that price.  So in 1892, it went down an index value of 100 to mid-60s.  nearly 40 point drop, as opposed to the depression, the Great Depression in Melbourne, we had a 20 point drop, and then it rebounded.  Let's have a look in Sydney.  In the 18 in 1892, you know, kind of, where is it?  Up here, it's really dodgy.  But you can see here, boom, it plummeted leveled out.  and plummeted again into 1896.  And in 1930s, you can see here, it plummeted again.  That's kind of relative.  A little bit better off, but not as bad.  But Melbourne, Melbourne copped it in the 1890s.  And they're predicting, some economists are predicting that the same thing is going to happen here in Sydney and Melbourne.  And of course, it'll flow through to the other cities.  Now, In all due diligence, exposure, any conflicts of interest I have, we are actually looking right now for my mother to help her downside.  So I'm apartment shopping.  And it's interesting to see here in Brisbane, you know, for little one bettors, the price that people bought them for in 2010, it's between 5% and 10% lower now that they're trying to sell it for.  So they're selling it for a loss eight years later.  So if you take inflation, you know, if you pack the inflation into that as well, that's a decent loss.  So let's have a read through this article and spread some more fear so I can get an even better price for my mother on these buildings.  So house prices in Sydney and Melbourne could fall by up to 25% this year alone.  And there's a chance that they could fall by half in the coming property bloodbath, an economist has warned.  LF economist founder Lindsay David says, who has been warning of the looming property crash for the past five years, said in a report today, the recent house price falls were just the beginning.  Core logic data from January showed Sydney and Melbourne prices were now 12.3% and 8.7% down from their respective peaks in July and November 2017, with Melbourne falling at the fastest rate ever seen.  Okay, so it's faster than this fall.  We think there's a chance property prices could fall by half in Sydney and Melbourne over the long run, Mr David said.  I wouldn't be surprised by falls of at least 40%.  When all hell breaks loose, you've only got so many buyers out there.  So just thinking about that for a moment, Sydney has just gone insane with the property prices.  It has just gone nuts with how high they are.  And you can get crappy, crappy houses for a million bucks.  Insane.  You get much better value for your money up here in Brisbane, I think.  So jumping back into the article, his base case of 20% falls in calendar year 2019 is significantly more bearish than other experts.  AMP Capital is tipping total peak to trough falls of 25% in Sydney and Melbourne, with UBS is tipping 25% with a rising risk of 30%.  Here we go.  So Australian mortgage debit acceleration.  Growth in mortgage debit is sharply declining.  People are getting worried.  People are preparing.  Mr.  David bases his forecast largely on the debit accelerator, which is strongly correlated with the housing price growth six months forward.  Latest data indicates that the debit accelerator is falling sharply in Sydney and Melbourne.  So it strongly correlates with price growth six months forward.  Well, that makes obvious sense, doesn't it?  It really does.  Growth in mortgage debit debt slowed from 6.3% in December 2017 to 4.7% in December 2018, with bank bosses tipping the number could fall to between 2% and 3% in coming years.  Okay, so we're getting less debt, so people are borrowing less, so they're investing less, so there's less buyers.  And there's a tightening of the sector as well.  With a baseline of 3%, the downturn in debit accelerator remains negative through to December 2019, at a minimum suggesting prices could continue to fall through to June 2020.  If that happens, Sydney and Melbourne will suffer peak to trough falls never experienced before outside of the 1890s depression and real estate collapse.  Mr.  David's report, Let the Bloodbath Begin, outlines no fewer than 18 separate headwinds facing the housing market.  From the $120 billion interest-only loan rollover and mortgage broker exodus to Labor Party's proposed tax reforms.  So I was hoping to get a copy of his report.  Let the bloodbath begin.  And I've been looking to try and find it online.  I'm having difficulty finding it.  It doesn't seem to be on his website.  People are tweeting to him asking him for a copy of the report or where it's available to get.  If anyone has it, could you please share it with me and let me know where you find it or where I can buy it?  Because I think it would be interesting to read, to elaborate upon what is being explained or put forward in the newspaper article here.  So he argues Australia is in stage two of a five-stage process as the country's debit finance asset bubble bursts.  The losses are going to mount and start to mount faster because now you've got the economic headwinds involved with the bubble bursting, he said.  So this is the five-stage process.  Stage one, beginning of the end.  After sharp rises in property prices and mortgage debt levels, prices start to fall.  There is little to no impact on construction.  mindset it's just a small pullback.  as part of the real estate cycle prices almost always rise in the long term.  now if anyone has been adding a comment to this if anyone has been involved in crypto trading and just seeing how fast up and down that cycle goes and just the psychology of trading of how people double down when they're losing money and that there's some charts that you have And we'll have a look at one of these examples.  So this here is one of these charts, the most important chart you'll ever need in your trading.  So the first part is the smart money.  That's the stealth phase.  And that's when it takes off, when it starts growing.  And then you get your institutional investors.  First people sell off, then you get the bear trap, so it's the awareness phase.  Then it's the mania phase, and we saw that in 2017, November to January, and just where you get media attention, enthusiasm, the public are involved and just greedy and just shoots up, and this is the future, we're all going to be rich.  And then it starts to go down and people are denying it, and there's another trap here, where it shoots back up.  So people will buy back in and oh, it's normal.  It was just a mistake.  And then boo, it goes right back down.  right back down it goes back up.  so maybe we're in this bear trap phase here but it's all a lot of it's to do with psychology.  if you read anything about trading particularly day traders.  a lot of it is to do with psychology and just your mental toughness.  so yeah this is i i could imagine this could relate very well to the housing sector.  so let's jump back here.  so Stage 2.  The bubble is pricked.  As prices continue to fall further, a small number of property developers become insolvent or cancels future projects.  Bank profitability begins to stall with little leeway to grow their mortgage books.  The mindset.  The property market declines more than expected, but is argued to be orderly considering the large run-up in prices in the years prior to the peak.  Stage three.  Now, I've seen some tweets where people are arguing.  we're already at this stage.  Rapid deflation.  Property prices fall well past thresholds that owners are comfortable with.  Bank profitability stalls and an escalating number of property developers default and or cancel future projects, resulting in rising construction job losses.  We're starting to see that in a video the other day about a shrinking construction industry.  Panic slowly starts to set in, especially among those with high loan-to-value ratios, LTIs and DSRs.  The mindset eventually shifts from denial to questioning how this can possibly be happening.  Nobody ever believed that property prices could fall this much.  We really have been living in a time when they've just been growing.  when they have just been growing.  You've got a generation.  And adding my own commentary to this.  On LinkedIn, I see it all the time.  On Facebook, I see it all the time.  These property gurus that will teach you how to make a fortune.  And that are just millionaires because they've made so much money in property.  Okay, so they happen to buy something and they made a hundred grand profit on a house they did nothing to.  Then they use that to buy another property.  And then they both went up and they bought another one and another one and another one.  That's kind of riding a wave.  It doesn't mean you're actually doing anything genius.  Guys, seriously.  I mean, good on you for doing it and taking advantage of it, but don't go on 60 minutes and complain when you have to pay back your interest-only loans like some people are doing.  So stage four, pain and reality.  Recession starts and panic has set in.  Lenders experience an NPAT wipeout with losses starting to mount.  Residential construction comes to a grinding halt with sharply rising total listings, dwellings for sale.  Mortgage defaults begin to rise as does the unemployment rate.  The mindset is we're doomed.  Property investors and recent homeowners feel like the world is crashing around them.  The level of fear of job losses and bankruptcy is considerable.  Stage 5.  Clean out.  The property market eventually finds its floor price.  With limited credit available, despite bank bailouts or nationalization, cashed-up buyers and private funds purchase distressed debit and dwellings at discounted rates.  Properties are relatively cheap, but most people have difficulty accessing credit.  Prices slowly begin to rebound.  The mindset, what do we do now?  Confusion abounds.  All the public was ever told by the establishment is that property only goes up.  But the opposite occurred.  Many people turned to alternative wealth creation opportunities outside of the property market.  Now that last bit there of the mindset, alternative wealth creation opportunities.  So I was talking to a colleague who's investing in silver and gold.  It's future-proofing.  That may be something to consider.  I might look at doing a video on the process of actually going and buying some gold.  How do you do it?  Rather than on an app, have a chunk of gold coming around.  We'll see.  We'll see.  So back to the article.  In stage one, prices start to fall sharply.  Oh, we've already read that.  Yep, he's just going through this.  We've already gone through it.  The final stage is when the property market finds its fall.  And that's what we're looking at.  So on the bright side, house prices will become very affordable again, Mr.  David said.  But it could be a horrible time for the economy.  The risk of recession is really high.  The early 90s recession was the recession we had to have.  But David believes by the end of this year, we could be entering the recession.  that's really going to hurt.  Yeah, he's probably right.  In the report, he argues that the more time passes, the less chance the government or regulators can arrest the decline with a bazooka stimulus that hits the bullseye from an ever-increasing distance.  Even if the Reserve Bank cuts rates further from its record low of 1.5%, I don't know how they can do that, banks will only pass on a fraction due to their reliance on overseas capital markets, where interest rates have been steadily increasing.  The only path to re-inflating prices will be to relax lending standards.  The prudent regulator did lift its cap on interest-only loans last month, but the banking royal commission fallout has made that unlikely.  Well, yeah, the royal commission into banking has kind of destroyed a whole lot of industry.  All the brokers are screwed now.  Gotta feel sorry for some of them.  Mr.  David said the downturn signaled the end of the Ponzi financial model.  People have to understand that there are simply too many investors already tied up in the housing market and they can't go and buy more real estate unless the value of their homes rises, he says.  That's how everyone was able to accumulate so many properties in such a short time.  They bought a $500,000 investment property.  Twelve months later, it was worth $600,000.  With that $100,000 in equity, you're able to buy another $500,000 property.  You can't do that anymore.  It's the reverse.  Yeah, it shows you.  They're the experts selling you their foolproof system on YouTube.  Mr.  David, who has often been criticized as a doomsayer, said the house price falls when nothing to feel good about.  It's safe to say we have for quite some time been the most hated macroeconomic research company in Australia, he said.  Poor guy, he's probably true.  But everything we've warned about has come to fruition.  The mortgage fraud, illegal lending practices, the stupidness of the RBA to cut interest rates too early.  But in reality, these are people's livelihoods we're talking about.  So, what do you all think is going to happen, people?  Do you reckon we're heading for a bust?  Do you think, what stage do you think we're in?  Do you think we're in stage three, stage two?  I think some industries are already in recession and what are you doing to prepare for this?  What costs are you cutting?  Are you investing in other sources of potential revenue already, just in case?  Who's buying gold, who's buying silver?  Time to cut the Netflix guys, cut all the luxuries, go back to the, tighten the belt, don't shop at Gold, shop at Aldi.  Anyway, guys, thanks for joining me for this episode.
