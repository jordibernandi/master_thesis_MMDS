            "text": "black round three one three back at it again.  you know why.  it's because this is therapeutic man.  back again with another video hence another therapy session.  today's topic and title is women who cheat always do this.  now there's a habit.  A pattern of behavior that she exhibits is something that will be an indicator of her guilt.  An indictment.  Something that she does that should lead you to great suspicion.  A cause to pause.  A reason to investigate.  This indicator is a habit.  It is a routine that cheating women always do.  And if you pick up on it, this may indicate possible infidelity.  And what she does, what they do is this.  She guards her phone with her life.  It's basically a cheating device exposing her to a world of possibilities.  countless men to encounter, and to begin relationships with without the constraints of distance, time, or being caught.  And she communicates using this device mainly when she's at work.  Don't believe me?  Is she available to talk to you during her whole and entire lunch hour?  Or is she busy at that time?  If you call her when she's on her lunch break, does she have to click over to answer?  Is she available sometimes on her lunch break and sometimes not?  Does she have an excuse why she didn't answer your call for the whole hour or the half hour that she was on her lunch break?  Hmm.  Again, her phone is a cheating device.  Now there are a few ways in which she goes about guarding this device so that you cannot detect her cheating.  So here are a few ways that she does this.  A, she's always near her cell phone.  She sleeps next to it.  She takes it into the bathroom with her.  It does not leave her sight just in case the other guy calls or sends her a text.  Or if the guy she just met decides to reach out to her.  If she knows that you don't have the guts to pick up her phone, she then feels secure in a guy having her number.  When you enter a relationship from the beginning, your woman is watching you.  She's picking up on your habits.  She sets her cheating up around your habits.  Habits.  She has an eye for details.  She's watching you.  She's checking you out.  She knows you.  She knows what your habits are.  And trust and believe.  there have been a few times when she tested you to see if you're the type of guy to go through her cell phone.  Part B. How she avoids detection of her cheating through this cheating device is that her phone is always locked.  Now, she has a passcode that you are unaware of.  She does this because of the possibility that you just might be nosy and snoop to see what's going on in her cell phone.  And if you ask her why she keeps it locked, she will have some excuse.  And it's sometimes reasonable to lock the phone.  However, why does she needs to do so when it's just you and her alone for the night or for the weekend?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Think about it.  See how she hides her cell phone cheating from you.  that she has a secret app.  she has an app that hides the app that she cheats with an app that keeps the text messages and the phone calls of her lovers away when she's with you.  but there are apps now that uncover those apps but also apps that keeps those other apps from uncovering those apps.  yeah it's a mess right D, and this is a big one here, and a prime indicator of possible infidelity.  She keeps the phone face down.  Face up means that you just might see who's calling or texting her.  You just may see the Facebook and Instagram message.  But face down conceals that act.  hides that possibility.  She does this often and habitually.  This is a sign that she just may be hiding something.  Every time she puts the phone down, it is face down.  Think about it.  E and last is when you walk past.  When you walk past her and she's on the phone She's scrolling through her screen.  You notice now that the screen quickly changes.  Why would she need to do this?  Why does her screen change abruptly, quickly when you enter the room?  And the answer is obvious.  It's because she has something to hide.  She's probably sneaking and creeping.  That screen changes right when you enter the room, doesn't it?  The first thing you do when she's sitting on the couch, when she's laying on a bed, when you walk past her and in passing, you take a glance at that cell phone, don't you?  And she knows this.  So when she see your eyes coming near her cheek device, she will quickly change the screen.  Why does she need to always do that?  Have you been paying attention?  I know you have, but you never ask her why, do you?  Are you afraid that the answer may be truthful?  Or are you afraid of her telling you lies?  You be the judge.  So watch her.  Pay attention to her cell phone habits.  Don't question her right away, though.  No, no, no.  Take a few months.  Be patient and key in on our habits.  Also, check her behavior.  Look at her behavior.  Observe her behavior.  Is she happy after looking at her cell phone?  After looking at her phone at a certain time of the day?  She just may be getting the how was your day text from the guy that she's interested in.  Key point here, always look at her face when she's been on her phone.  Women wear their emotions on their faces like it's makeup.  Now, if a woman is serious about you.  And you're serious about her.  You should have the passcode to her cell phone.  Even the fingerprint, your fingerprint should also be on there.  You should have access to her cell phone at will.  However, now she should not have access to yours.  What?  Why?  Because if you are the man.  If you are the man, the leader, the boss of your relationship, then by very definition there are things that you can do that she cannot do.  This is what it means to be the boss.  You make the rules, but the rules do not apply to you.  None of that 50 50 stuff.  You are the lead in your relationship, not her.  She is not co-captain.  And if you are the lead, then, of course, there are things that you can do that she cannot do.  Are you the boss in your relationship or are you the beta in the relationship?  And understand that the beta has a higher tendency to be played.  You should be as a boss and she should be as an employee, a supervisor and worker relationship.  This is how you should operate.  For example, now you have to be at work at a certain time on a certain day.  Failure to do this can result in disciplinary action against you.  All employers treat their employees like children.  The employer as the boss sets rewards and punishments.  This is authority.  So then you must show up to work on time or else.  However, your boss now can come to work when they feel like it.  And even if you work for yourself, there are government regulations, rules, guidelines, and taxes that you have to abide by.  The point is, is that the boss does what he wants while you do what you are told.  He writes the checks that you work for.  So it should be with your lady because you are more than her boss.  How?  You may ask.  And I'll answer you.  There are many ways, but I'll state one major way.  Imagine this.  You're walking down the street at night and some stranger walks up with intentions to do harm.  Most men will protect.  their woman with their lives.  So if you give your life for her, then she should live her life for you.  And her life should be in servitude to you.  Now, if she is unwilling to give you this password to her phone, as well as the password to all of her social media accounts, although she shouldn't even be on social media, but if she is, you should have access to it.  And if you don't, then she is not your woman.  She is not the woman to be taken seriously.  She's not wifey.  Wifey is an action, not just a word, just like a fireman is not just a title only.  It's an action.  Fighting fires is what they do.  Wifey is what she does.  not just who she claims to be.  So treat her according to her works.  Deal with her according to the status that she sets forth by her works.  If she's acting like wifey, then she is.  If she's not, then of course she isn't.  Now back to the point.  Get that password from her.  Tell her to give it to you unless you're afraid to demand such and which says volumes about you as a man.  And what it says is this.  You run around your house instead of running your house.  Thus, she, not you, is the man of the house.  Now, how are you a man?  How are you the man and you are afraid of your woman?  Demand that passcode.  Now, be aware.  That simps and the succubus will try to shame you and guilt you into not paying attention to her in this manner.  They'll try to shame you for demanding such submission.  They will call you weak and insecure.  This is just a mind game, a trick, a ploy to convince you to give her the freedom to do whatever it is that she wants and to give her the room and the space and the ability to cheat more comfortably.  The Simpson, a succubi will say that you should just trust her.  But, you know, as a thinking man, that female nature is not to be trusted.  And we know that she often can't even trust herself.  So why should you?  Now, some may say, then why even deal with a woman in the first place?  Well, that's my point.  Exactly.  Why deal with her if you have to do all of that?  Exactly.  You do have to do all of that.  Therefore, what should be your response to that question?  But if you're going to deal with the ladies, especially if you're going to deal with them closely, you got to play the game.  It's play or be played.  And this is what I'm discussing here.  You got to know what your woman is capable of.  You got to know what she's doing and don't be shamed into not watching.  Not being skeptical.  You have more to lose in a relationship than she does.  So you should keep that watchful eye.  You should keep tabs.  Now, what investor doesn't keep an eye on his investment?  What parent doesn't keep an eye on their child?  Shouldn't you keep an eye on your woman, the woman that you love, the woman that you would sacrifice for?  If you are a man, a boss, an alpha, then you cannot allow others to shame you for being the man that you are.  For keeping tabs on what's important to you, for keeping a watchful eye on what's important to you.  Now, on the flip side, if she means nothing to you, then it really doesn't matter.  And for some of us, it's best to deal with her in this manner, to care nothing about her.  But this video is for those who are invested in a relationship.  So hold her to a standard, your standards.
