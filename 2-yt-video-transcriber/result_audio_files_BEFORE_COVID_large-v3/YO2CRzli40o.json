            "text": "Hello everyone, Tina Spaulding, Trance Channel here.  I have been getting the nudge to do a channeling, so I think I know who it is.  So let's see who wants to come through.  Oh, we are the Arcturians and we are associated with the Galactic Federation and we are here to welcome you into 2020.  2020 is perfect vision.  What has to be removed to see clearly are the impediments in front of your eyes.  In human terms that means erroneous beliefs, propaganda, things that have been taught to you that are not true.  These are the things that are going to be removed from your vision in this year.  This is going to be a challenging experience for those of you that have not been doing a lot of groundwork.  Those of you that have been working on your perceptions and your beliefs for a long time are going to be fine.  You are going to be challenged, yes, because you are going to have to let go of some things that you thought were permanent but they were merely well-established beliefs from the cultural trainings that you have undergone.  Those of you that have not been so diligent in your we will say internal investigations, are going to be having a harder time of it because you have been seeking your what you call salvation, your gods, your addictions out in the world through substances, people, television, these kinds of things, seeking your identity out there through other people's opinions.  What 2020 is about for all of you is coming into direct conscious contact with higher frequency spiritual beings who are your guides and teachers, your mentors, your galactic brothers and sisters of a more evolved nature.  Many of the systems that you have been subjected to have been designed and implemented by extraterrestrial brothers and sisters of a less high frequency.  This does not mean that they are not intelligent.  It does not mean that they are not clever.  What it means is that they have service to self as their modus operandi, as you say.  We do not have service to self as our be all and end all.  In fact, we are very compassionate, loving and caring beings and we care and wish the best for our human brothers and sisters.  And so we now, through the increasing frequencies that are available to you, we now have more clear access and what we want you to know is that we are able to communicate with you more readily as this year moves along.  So for those of you that are curious, those of you that are courageous, those of you that are firmly grounded in your own mortality and infinite power, What do we mean by that?  Well, it seems contradictory.  To be grounded in your mortality means that you own the fact that you are in a body right now.  You understand how to handle it.  You understand how to care for it.  We are not talking about focusing on death at all.  We are in fact talking about focusing on life and this is one of the, we will say, most detrimental factors in your programming at this time that you do not value.  You say you do, but you do not value your life in that sense.  You will do things to the body that are very, very detrimental to the body.  Your pharmaceutical industries are great sources of poison and pain.  And yet there is a program running in many of you that says when you get sick, you go to the doctor and get a pill.  This is a very, very dangerous program because you are completely handing over your own personal power to a system that does not have your best interests at heart even though they smile and say they do.  So when we say we want you to value your mortality that means that we want you to understand the value of the body as a communication device.  We want you to understand the body as the vehicle through which you are currently moving yourself around so that you may have experiences and interactions and communications.  And at the same time, you are well aware of your spiritual nature.  This is the balanced human, this is the human that is going to be, we will say, our target audience when it comes to communications.  so if you are desirous of having communications with your galactic brothers and sisters which is going to be increasingly facilitated over the next months then we would like you to address the issues of the body that you have not yet addressed.  That means that you are to see your food and drinks as nutrition and fuel, not entertainment.  It is not for entertainment.  This does not mean that the food and fuel that you use does not taste good.  We are astonished at times.  to see what the average human eats.  It is processed a lot of the time.  Processed food is denuded of life force and life force.  denuded food will in turn denude your life force from you.  And so this is a very important point.  We know that you are tired of dietary on your planet.  we say do not buy anything processed and that includes things such as bread and crackers.  that is processed food.  anything that comes in a box is processed food.  we want you to feed yourself from the fresh aisle and from the humanely raised meats.  if you choose to eat meat you can choose either or we do not care.  The frequency of humanely raised protein is good for the developing body and allows, we will say, premium nutrition in the sense that it is top quality.  The body does not have to struggle to survive when you are giving it some good quality proteins.  Of course, proteins are found in many things, not just meats.  And we understand that as a human population, you have been programmed to eat meat To some extent.  We do not want you pigging out, so to speak, on meat.  We would like you to have it if you so choose.  But if you so choose, do not be cheap.  Buy the best you can from a reputable dealer that is telling you how these animals are raised and shows you that they are cared for to some degree.  The industrial meat production on your planet is horrific and primitive and we do not condone it.  So we must allow those beings who are on the evolutionary path to wean themselves away from that.  But we encourage you to do that sooner rather than later if you are interested in communications.  Communications from us are fun.  Communications from us are going to give you advice that is very, very sound.  Now your mechanical structures are undergoing a severe upgrade at this time.  That means your nervous system is being upgraded whether you like it or not we say because it is a part of the evolutionary cycle of the planet on which you are residing.  So you are being taken along for the ride.  And what this upgrade is going to do is that it's going to upgrade the communications between physical and non-physical.  That means that you are going to feel more.  It means that you are going to dream more.  It means that you are going to get intuitive hits more.  You are going to have precognitive experiences more.  You are going to have deep knowing more.  You are going to have more synchronicities in your lives.  Whether or not you understand what is going on.  And you can understand that those beings that are deeply immersed in the material world are going to find some of this disconcerting.  Knowing when things are going to happen.  Knowing that... a loved one is going to pass over.  These sorts of things can become very disconcerting for those who are untrained because of the terrifying programs to which you have been subjected in what you call your religious upbringings and your horror movies.  These have all been used to shut you down to your detriment and so these programs are going to be activated as you are activated into a higher functioning, higher frequency being.  This does not mean that anything bad is happening.  What it means is that those fear mongering evil programs have to be removed from your consciousness for you to continue on your evolutionary journey.  And that means that they must be seen and felt and you must evict them from your consciousness.  If they are in your consciousness and you act as if they are true, you are feeding them, condoning them, nurturing them and babying them, keeping them for yourself.  You do not see it this way.  You think that you are afraid because there is something to be afraid of.  No, you are afraid because you have been taught to be afraid by very, very clever programmers.  So what you are going to be facing in the coming months is an interior revolution evolution that is going to be somewhat challenging.  What this is going to look like for those of you that have been doing a lot of work already is that you are going to be stepping up into collaborative work.  ventures that you perhaps before would never have considered.  You will consider working with community members.  You will consider starting businesses with friends.  You will be invited to join together with other beings to bring about something that individually you would have been unable to bring about.  And so this too will challenge those of you raised in this highly individualistic society.  And you will have deep feelings of concern or conflict arising in you.  Again, the same thing is happening.  You are being asked to evolve into a collaborative kind of frequency.  And that, of course, is where we are.  We collaborate with our fellow brothers and sisters.  We are not warring.  We are not judging.  We are helping each other to achieve that which we are inspired to do.  And we have a lot of fun doing it.  Many of you are so tired from doing things alone, but you do not realize there is another way.  But as these evolutionary cycles increase in power, you are going to be driven towards that which is more collaborative.  Once again, your beliefs about working with others as a fearful concept will arise and you will have to sort of wrestle your way through them so that you can step up into a new frequency.  You see, many of you want to evolve, yet many of you want to communicate with us and yet you are not even communicating with yourself or each other.  And this is going to be the next step in your society's evolution, coming together to achieve that which the solitary cannot achieve.  Why?  Because you are now working from a platform of love and communion rather than a platform of separation and fear.  And so these are some of the changes that are going to be corporeal in your society, meaning they are going to change the very body of your society.  and as more and more of you come together to initiate change and to collaborate on fun adventures, creative projects, this is going to shift and change the economy, this is going to shift and change the focus of your ideas around government and how land is used, how money is used.  and you are going to be going through a steep learning curve that is necessary to bring your society to a level with which we may say hang out, communicate with, commiserate with.  We are very excited for your society and what is coming through and we are very pleased to be able to tell you these stories because this being has done what we have just suggested that you do.  She has removed many of the distortions from her mind so that she is able to surrender into a higher frequency communication.  She has dedicated her time and life to assisting in the ascension process, mostly because she started to feel the benefits of it herself and wanted to share that experience with all of you.  So we would suggest that you continue to tune into this being as a lot of information is going to be coming through her and to her and there are going to be some exciting developments on the horizon.  We are the Arcturian Council and we are very pleased to have had this opportunity to encourage you on your journey towards expansion and evolution and we know that you are afraid when you look at your world.  Stop looking at your world as if it's going to attack you.  Look at the world as the end result of creation, miscreation and confusion.  Look at it with love and compassion and employ your intelligence, employ your loving heart and mind, your wisdom and clarify yourself so that you may step up and Be the component in a new society that you are enthusiastic to watch come into being.  We will speak to you at another time.  Thank you.  I'll see you again soon.  Bye. ",
