And the spooky genre that we call horror movies has the most embarrassing music videos of them all.  Today, I have collected five of them, and it is my absolute pleasure to share them with you.  You will find a playlist that collects them all listed in the description, and before I even get started, I just want to take a moment to say, you're welcome.  Now this one's got to be at the bottom of the list, because it kind of slaps.  We're the Team Warriors!  But I mean, also, let's be real here.  This video is so 80s.  it looks like a season of Stranger Things threw up on it.  The video features Kristen, the protagonist from Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3, Dream Warriors, running around, seeing stuff that's normally Freddy stuff, but oops, it's all Dokken.  Who's Dokken?  It's Dokken, everybody.  I love that the front man here is playing a guitar made of skeletons, which is only fitting because in this video, Daken are ghosts.  But also they're calling themselves the Dream Warriors, who are the good guys in the movie.  Sometimes Kristen wants to bone down on this dude and bone down on his cool bone guitar.  Sometimes this dude is chasing her around Freddy's house doing all spooky stuff.  Sex and violence intertwined.  not in a thought-provoking or interesting way, just there because you wanted to make a music video about a horror movie.  So of course, you have to imply that the underage protagonist definitely wants to fuck the main guy in the band.  At one point, she grabs one of the little girls that sings the 1-2 Freddy's Coming For You song, and then it turns into a skeleton.  Skeletons are a theme in this video.  So here's my question, did Dokken do that to the child?  You might think, Freddy did that.  But no, this is all Freddy's nightmare.  He's scared of Dokken, and Dokken are evil?  What a nightmare.  Who were those guys?  In the fiction of this video, did they murder that child?  Keep down, Goblin. ",

But you'll see, the Maniac Cop movies are about a police officer who is slightly less violent than the average police officer.  He's on a quest for vengeance, and he can't be stopped.  And that, you see, is why they call him the Maniac Cop.  Now if you're unfamiliar, this should about cover it.  This is the type of rap that you might expect from an educational children's film about escalator safety.  And if that sounds like far too specific a comparison, it's because I really wanted to include a clip of this. ",

The secret will keep you alive.  Move your dead bones, bones, bones.  Move your dead bones, bones, bones.  You'll dance for the rest of your life.  This is a Euro dance song about what if being brought back from the dead by the reanimator made you very horny.  It's performed by an artist named Dr.  Reanimator, presumably, not his typical stage name, who is handsome in a way that, like, you don't like it.  Like, I don't want him to be that handsome.  And I don't want to make fun of someone's appearance.  I think that's low.

This is the most embarrassing part of a movie that features Ice-T playing a character named Mac Daddy.  How I long for the days of Freddy and the Fat Boys.  This song is so forgettable that I feel kind of bad ending on it because really It has to be the worst, because unlike the other songs on this list, it plays within the movie.  You'd have to skip the last few minutes of the movie to enjoy it, and I think you should probably skip the whole movie, but if you watch it by accident, you're going to be exposed to this song.  The other songs on this list are funnier and more well-constructed and just more interesting in general, and they have far less of a reason to exist than this one.
