            "text": "So in just a few moments guys, I'm gonna show you a clip that is without hyperbole, one of the most inspirational two minutes you might ever see.  None of that is exaggerated.  But before that, I want to set the stage just a little bit.  And I want to talk about how Bernie Sanders' surge is causing absolute terror among the rich and wealthy and well-connected.  The 1%.  The heads of the pharmaceutical and fossil fuel and insurance industries.  And all those sorts of people that have benefited disproportionately from the exploitation of the marginalized, of the working class, and of the environment, and of society more generally.  And Bernie Sanders... As he rises in the early state polls, and he rises in the Super Tuesday polls, and he rises in the national polls, and he rises in polls against Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups, they are getting more and more nervous and more and more desperate.  But there's one reason above all.  that Bernie Sanders is truly striking that fear and he's truly building that momentum among the broad 99%.  And this ad that I'm going to show you tells you why. ",

            "text": "I just want to say one of my favorite writers growing up was a man named James Baldwin.  And I remember Baldwin saying, you asked my father to wait, my brother to wait, my uncle to wait.  How long must I wait on freedom?  How long must I wait on rights and equality and liberty?  And as a black child, that resonated with me because I knew I had been denied and I personalized that.  But as I grew, I started to understand.  poor white people have been denied.  Women have been denied.  Gays and lesbians, transgender people been denied.  Immigrant children been denied.  Everybody outside of that 1% has been denied.  So I want you to take a few seconds to look to your left and look to your right.  Look to your neighbor and say, neighbor, the time is now.  There are more of us.  We're stronger.  We will wait no longer.  The time is now.  When you go to that booth next year, I need you to carry in that booth the memory of this room.  Black, white, straight, gay, men, female.  We are together.  We are united.  Our time is right now.  We will not wait four more years.  We will not wait 20 more years.  We will not wait two more presidents.  We will not wait three more presidents.  The time is now.  The time is not in the future.  The time is not some abstract time.  The time is not something that might be.  The time ain't something that could be.  The time ain't nothing.  that should be, that would be.  It ain't tomorrow.  It ain't the day after.  It ain't coming next week.  The time is... The time is... The time is... The time is... Senator Bernard Sanders will be the next president of the United States of America. ",

            "text": "Thank you.  Wasn't that absolutely moving?  Wasn't that tear jerking in some ways in an inspirational way?  That was Killer Mike, a longtime supporter of Bernie Sanders, who was speaking about how he grew to understand that the challenges he faced as a young black man were were very real... and very important... and have still not been overcome... but how they are at least... somewhat connected... to the struggles of many other people... women... LGBTQ people... the poor... People struggling to get by.  All of these sorts of people have been left behind, have been denied, have been prevented from reaching their potential, have been prevented from seeking opportunities, have been prevented from the basic human dignity that was supposed to be theirs as it should belong to everyone.  And in this moment, Killer Mike does something extremely profound.  He links together the broad, diverse, multiracial working class of the United States in a common struggle against that 1%, against the financial and political and social and cultural elite, because they are the ones that are denying the basic dignities and the basic liberties and the basic equalities that the broad 99% deserves but does not yet have.  And he notes that this fight cannot wait.  They can't wait one more president, two more presidents, three more presidents.  They cannot wait four or eight or 20 years.  They cannot wait any longer because of all the people that are struggling now, the people yet to be born, but will be born into struggle unless we stop things now.  This has to change now.  And Bernie Sanders is the candidate who can bring together this broad movement of regular people of various backgrounds and experiences and geographies and walks of life.  Together to fight for that basic justice and dignity and equality, to fight for those programs that will ensure that everyone, regardless of how they were born, will have the chance to be the best person they can be.  A fight against those people who use their wealth and privilege to perpetuate further inequality and a further lack of opportunity for the broad 99%.  Which, yes, does disproportionately include marginalized people from racialized backgrounds and other marginalized backgrounds.  But which also includes millions upon millions of white people, white men.  It is a multiracial struggle for justice.  This is why the time is now.  Killer Mike lays it out.  This extremely passionate ad lays it out.  This is why he terrifies them, guys.  This more than anything.  Lots of reasons.  Bernie terrifies the rich and wealthy and well-connected.  But his ability to build a multiracial working class movement, a truly diverse working class movement, is what makes him an existential threat to the political and social and economic status quo.  That's why they're trying to stop him.  But that's why people like Killer Mike and so many others believe in him and show such passion about him.  So share this clip around, guys.  Go check out the original makers of this video.  I'm going to post that link in the description.  Give them a follow.  Check their video out.  Let them know that they did a great job.  But I wanted to share this video along with my analysis because I think these two minutes... are not only good to watch, but my goodness, does it encapsulate why Bernie Sanders is the nightmare of the elite, but he's the dream for the rest of us.
