            "text": "Good afternoon, everyone.  David Dubine here, creator of Adapt 2030 channel on YouTube, as well as Mini Ice Age Conversations podcast three times a week.  I wanted to reach out and thank every single one of my Patreon supporters for all that you've helped me with over these last couple of years.  It is our community.  It's not my or what I do, but it is ours.  There's so much going on right now with the changes that you've seen and the uptick in unusual weather, jet streams shifting all over the place.  So what I wanted to do from this point forward is start to talk about solutions, areas that are showing already signs of stress or upticks.  Every single winter it's more intense or during the summer it's more heat and flooding, but these same things keep reoccurring in the same places.  It's no longer just about reporting what's happening in point A or point B. Now it's about solutions and the immediacy of sharing this information.  It's about the cycles of economy, the cycles of food.  We also have these society cycles, climate cycles, civilization cycles, and they all seem to be culminating right now.  So as we do move forward into the intensification, I wanted to try to come back to history as well as take a look and try to explain the charts to you better, give you more information so you can explain it to others, and also have the upper hand on what's going on.  Sure, you can watch the videos.  Those are free on YouTube.  The Mini Ice Age Conversations podcast is also free to listen to.  But what I want to focus is bringing you premium content into the Patreon platform, something I'm not going to be sharing publicly.  It's only available for Patreon subscribers.  It's just going to be quick.  one-time digestible nuggets of information that are in PDF form.  You can open it up.  You can read through.  It'll be two to three pages.  It's kind of what I want to hit at, that maximum five-minute range.  so you can scan through, you can read it, you can re-look at the charts, you can print it out, you can share it.  This is where I want to go with the channel.  This is going to be kind of fun to watch it, but I want you to have the most information coming forward so you can protect your family, explain it to your friends, bring together communities, and this is where the real safety is.  And thank you to every single one of you who is backing me.  This allows me to continue to produce at least 20 videos per month, which I am going to do and uptick this, as well as the Mini Ice Age Conversation podcast.  Without your support, I really can't do it.  It takes an enormous amount of time to do the research, and I've devoted my whole time into bringing you this information.  It's all about solving problems that are starting to manifest.  And I believe that we're all seeing changes energetically as well.  You know, the world seems to be a little bit more chaotic.  I do believe that's part of trying to mask some of what these food price increases are going to be, how the media is going to try to explain away some of these changes that are happening.  This is one of the reasons also I want to do it in this more written form above what you can find on the net for free.  because you need to start talking with friends and family, and this is a great way to do it.  I'll make it so you can print off these PDFs.  And these are the conversations we need to have.  How do you start a conversation with somebody without being ridiculed by them?  Well, if you have this written here and you can show them a scientific document or something behind it, some other analysis, it's much easier to explain it than just speaking to them.  And then start those conversations that you really need to have.  You know, around the community where you are, this is the safest place.  You already have a network of friends, family.  You've been there for years, months, whatever.  It's going to be longer than you will be if you move to a new place.  And I want to thank every single one of you again for backing me.  If you do decide to become a new backer, you get the information.  And I will see you after I send you your first couple PDFs on some of the images that I think are most integral to you.  You've got core point to explain it to other people.  David Devine, ADAPT 2030.  Thank you so much. ",
