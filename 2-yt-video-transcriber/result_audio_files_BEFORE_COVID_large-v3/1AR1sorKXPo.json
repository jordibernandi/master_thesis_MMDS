            "text": "good evening everyone welcome back.  blue ridge silverhound.  i'm your host sean and we are going to uh take a look at again the 1983 dated washington quarters.  okay um it's almost like we're beating a horse to death.  but I'm telling you, this video is going to open up a lot of eyes, mostly in part due to the kind of like the showcase that I have prepared for you of other coins that are in brilliant, uncirculated condition.  So we're going to compare by decade a few of the coins to see how these have progressed.  And we're going to go as far back as the 50s, ladies and gentlemen.  And, you know, like I had mentioned, I pull out of change 1983 quarters, okay?  You guys remember the reason?  Oh, well, these apparently sell for double face value.  And I know for a fact because I sell them.  So, you know, it's again, it's not a lot of money, but there are a few things you need to know about the 1983 dates of Washington quarters.  And you can also kind of lump in 1982.  OK, first and foremost.  1983.  Okay.  So the US Mint did not produce any mint sets for 1982 and 83.  Okay.  Which kind of affected the overall survival rate of the existing coinage that was in circulation.  Okay.  During the 80s, nobody was really saving coins.  Okay.  coin collecting was kind of waning a little bit.  It was starting to become less favorable as, you know, the hobby of choice.  So a lot of coins during the 80s were never saved up in BU condition, especially in the early 80s.  And with there being no mint sets, A lot of them circulated to the point where they only look like this.  And that's the primary reason why that these sell for about double face value in a full roll.  I don't normally sell them as single coins because you just don't make a lot of money that way.  But aside from the whole U.S.  mid-set kind of piece of it, we're also going to look at condition, okay?  Because this is a coin right here that is extremely rare in grades above mid-state 66.  As a matter of fact, the 1983s in Denver.  Okay, this is a Denver minted coin right here.  You can even look it up, PCGS price guide, which is also on PCGS.com.  Take a look at not only the population report, but also the price guide part of it.  This coin right here in mint state 67 is $1,450.  That is the top grade for the 83D, okay?  In 1983, the Philadelphia coin is $1,000.  Whereas all the other dates around it, 81s, 82s, 84s, 85s, all the way up, there are 67 pluses, there are 68s, okay?  And these are coins that sell for about $2,500 to about $5,000, $6,000.  So what happens if, let's say, the first 1983D Mid-State 67 Plus hits the market?  Okay, the one and only, first one ever.  Well, we're probably talking about a potential $7,500 to $10,000 coin.  That's how much of a big deal it is.  All right, so what I wanted to do is kind of go along the years.  And for reference, I have a Mid-State 66 slabbed PCGS 1966.  So 66 and 66.  That's a pretty, pretty nice coin right there.  But, you know, this is only the second date removed after the end of the silver era.  So we're going to go ahead and put that right there.  So the first coin that I'm going to show and share with you is a 55.  So the 1950s era of quarters was extremely well struck.  Number one.  Number two, they had phenomenal luster, which means they took care of their dyes.  You didn't have really the bad dye flow lines that go out into the fields.  The luster is strong and true.  You look on the reverse, you didn't see a whole lot of die cracks and all sorts of various other die wear, premature die wear.  that's normally associated with a coin in which they really did not maintain their dies all too well.  In the course of the minting, Of all these coins, the US Mint goes through many, many sets of dies because eventually they break down, they crack and crumble, and they just self-destruct.  In the case of the 1950s, the US Mint employees did a marvelous job at... upkeeping the dies, which is why you had coins that were in phenomenal shape.  Again, take a look at the PCGS population reports, and you will find that a lot of dates during the 50s have mid-state 68 examples.  I think there might even be a few that are 68 plus thereabouts.  Pretty nice.  So now we go on to the 60s.  Of course, we have the 60s here, and you begin to see some cracks in the foundation in how they maintain their dies.  What I have here is another 66.  This is, by the way, a mint state coin, not to be confused with a special mint set coin.  And you can tell the difference because you're not going to have quite as much of the softness of the strike in a special mint set coin than you would with a business strike piece.  Okay, as you guys know, a special mint set was simply a replacement of the proof set.  The mint did away with proof sets.  But due to popular demand from the collecting public, they brought it back in the form of a special mint set.  But in the case of the Brilliant Uncirculated Coins, you could tell right away that we're beginning to see some difference in the overall quality.  You see a little bit of mushiness on all of the devices.  from the very curls in George Washington's hair to some of the mushiness in the motto, In God We Trust.  And if we looked on the reverse, I mean, it still looks pretty good, but typically in the 1960s decade of Washington quarters, we begin to see some little dye cracks, some stress cracks, all stemming from overusage of those dyes.  That's the 60s for you.  but take a look at this one too.  This one's relatively mushy and I would venture to guess that's why this one only got a 66.  Because all in all, this is a phenomenal looking coin.  In some instances, this is probably a 67.  But you can see some of the die flow right there, which indicates some premature die wear right there in front of the eagle's beak.  So it's not a complete full luster.  You get the break there where you get some of that premature die wear.  All right, so we're gonna jump ahead and let's go ahead and take a look at where things really begin to get really bad and that's 1969.  So this particular date has been a source of frustration for me because I have been scouring many, many mint sets, many BU rolls for gem condition coins in about mint state 66 plus and higher and I have been unsuccessful.  This coin right here has come out of a mid-set, and as you can tell, okay, the luster is dialed down here, okay?  I do have it light-pointed directly at it, so, you know, the luster might be amplified a hair.  But you see the whitish kind of, like, milky, spottish color?  Overtone of the coin.  Okay, that's a result of the plastics and the chemicals coming off of such plastics from the mint set.  So a lot of the mint set coins looked like this.  Okay, it was pretty bad Really bad.  As a matter of fact, this is a coin right here in mint state 67 and higher is worth about $5,000 to $7,000.  It's just that tough.  And look how bad the strike is.  Okay, things were starting to get kind of funny.  Almost kind of to the point where, you know, the mint's not even trying anymore.  All right, so we're going to skip all the way ahead to 1983.  Okay, see the difference here?  Take a look at In God We Trust.  What do you notice?  Okay, you notice some strikethrough, which is strikethrough grease.  You also see it in Liberty.  Take a look at that.  This is a BU83P example.  That does not look very good.  Okay, the luster's a little bit dialed down.  Okay, it's not too bad.  The coin is relatively clean in this case, but we gotta take into consideration the fact that, you know, 30 years before that, the Mint was making absolutely hammered coins.  All right, so the 83P right here, this was the norm.  This is what coins look like coming out of the US Mint, okay?  They did not look too hot at all.  And that's primarily the reason, as you can see, the softness of the stripe.  See the hair behind here, right behind Washington's neck?  Okay, that's a very telling sign right there of how flat and how deteriorated the dies were at the time.  Okay, so the coin looks very lifeless in this state.  But this is a coin that would traditionally be in mint state 64 or 65.  All right, this coin right here is about $25 raw.  It's kind of hard to believe, but there are no alternatives.  Okay, there is no, yeah, check that out.  There are no US mint sets to compare off of.  You got whatever came out of circulation at that point as far as a collectible coin.  All right, so let's go ahead and skip ahead to 1996.  It got a little bit better, but see what they did?  I think they took the engraving a little bit too far because this coin right here has what we affectionately call in this series spaghetti hair.  So the over engraving of the actual individual strands of hair gave the look of a bowl of spaghetti on Washington's head.  It was not very loved by the collecting public.  It looked too artificial, it looked cartoonish, you name it.  But one thing's for sure, the luster is a lot stronger, albeit the quality of these coins remain the same.  in that mint state 66 to 67 level, it's tough to find coins graded much higher than that.  So, you know, that's kind of the challenge when it comes to even the mid to late 90s quarters.  So here is another one here for comparison, another spaghetti here.  This is a 98P and as you can see, I'm showing you just strictly Philadelphia coins, okay?  So that way you guys can get kind of an idea of how these things were produced at one particular mint.  All right, it would be unfair to show you Philadelphia, Denver minted coins that go flip flop back and forth because the quality is just different.  It's like night and day.  So there you go.  I mean, they did a better job with the upkeep of the dies because during this time, you really didn't see too much erosion in the die quality.  So you get really nice features.  Take a look at the breast feathers on the Eagle on the reverse.  They're fully defined.  Okay, if we went back to the 1983 here, somewhere, I've got a few of these.  But as you can see, you have no really good definition of a lot of those areas on the eagle's breast.  The coins are barely 10 years apart, but we're talking about two different generations of coin all of a sudden.  So now we jump into the statehood quarter program.  Okay.  And as you guys know, this was a really popular program.  While they still did the spaghetti hair, they did kind of tone it down just a shade.  Okay.  Now what do we mean by tone down?  Well, the engraving is a little bit less kind of cutting edge, I suppose.  So the coins themselves look kind of similar.  They did modify the offers to fit in things like Liberty and quarter dollar and know things of that nature.  as you can see there is no date but overall quality again really tough to find these coins in grades above mint state 67. all right we're getting now into the age where you know more of the superficial stuff is beginning to affect the overall quality of the later dated coins primarily the rinses and the cleaning agents that they use on the coins during production.  Okay, it plays a huge role in things like these white milky spots that you see on this BU main statehood quarter.  All right, and then finally, you know, we have to show you a ATB or a National Park quarter.  Okay, this is the Kasachi 2015P.  You know not the best specimen.  The luster is pretty good.  albeit this coin here kind of has kind of a weird milky skin which actually is the surface of the coin because they do sandblast the surfaces of these coins to give it more of a satin finish.  OK, so it's a completely kind of different feel and look.  OK, this really does look like a coin that was a. that was one that was born and bred from today's technology.  Of course, they use computers and lasers and, you know, the engraving technology.  technology has stepped up tremendously.  And that's why you have a lot more detail in coins like this.  But the fact still remains that the overall quality is, eh, I give it probably a B minus, if not a C plus, in the overall luster and execution and quality of the coins.  So there you go.  All in all, the two coins that stand out the most are the 1983 and the 69.  In terms of quality, They're horrible, okay?  And it comes at a time where the mint just didn't really take care of the coins.  that well.  And in the case of the 1983, it was an age in which they did not care to make mint sets and therefore kind of crush the market value to a point where these things are expensive on a singular level.  Can you imagine paying $25 to $50 for a BU Raw 1983P Washington Quarter?  Today you can't.  But think about it this way before I let you guys take off.  Would you guys imagine paying $10,000 for a 1983 quarter?  It's bound to happen.  One day.  There's going to be one example that's a grayed out at mint state 67 plus and possibly a mint state 68.  It's going to be a red herring.  It's going to be this coin that really should not really exist because of... the quality control management of the U.S.  Mint during the 80s.  So I want to thank you guys for joining in on this one.  As you can see, you know, we got a nice comparison of all the quarters for a good, you know, four decades.
