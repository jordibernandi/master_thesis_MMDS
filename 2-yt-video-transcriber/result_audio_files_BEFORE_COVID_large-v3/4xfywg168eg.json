Both of them make it through entire civilization.  Oh, well, you have to say carbon dating has been debunked.  So first of all, go do a study on radiometric dating, because it's not just carbon dating.  There are a number of different radiometric dating methods, and they overlap, and they overlap with other methods like tree dendrology and stuff like that.  And so we can put together a good understanding of the timeline, both geological time.  We can even get to astronomical time by observing things within our solar system and within our galaxy.  When you say, and I realize you're no longer on.  I didn't care.  I wasn't waiting for an answer from you personally.  When you say carbon dating has been debunked, that's just wrong.  What's been debunked is when carbon dating is used in certain ways.  And you know how we showed when those results were flawed?  By using other radiometric dating methods and other dating methods that can show a reliability.  This is what happens when you have a statistical outlier and you have somebody who doesn't know fuck all about science.  They throw out all the science.  And what science does is it throws out the statistical outlier.  Because that's what you're supposed to do.  One interesting thing, if you have one of those, hey, here's a jar up here with gumballs in it.  If you have one of those contests where you ask people to guess how many gumballs are in that thing.  If you just have one person do it, who knows how close you're going to get.  But if you had a thousand people guess and averaged it.  you will almost get it dead on the nose.  Because the wisdom of crowds, which is this nebulous thing, it's not like we all know the answer or all of us kind of know the answer or whatever else, but on the whole, on the average, we are more likely to be right about some things, not everything, than we are to be wrong.  That's not an appeal to popularity, that's just the way statistics work.  Some people are gonna look at that and be able to assess exactly how many of them are in there or pretty close, and some people are gonna, there's a million gumballs in there.  and somebody's going to say four.  It is the science and mathematics that allow us to not only understand exactly how to calculate that, but how some people are better at estimating it than others, and how when you use a statistically large sample, you're going to get closer and closer to accuracy, and why we should toss out the outliers.  So if somebody walks in and says there's four in there, we toss that one out.  If somebody walks in and says there's a million in there, we toss that one out.  That's still just no guarantee we can get that right.  That's not even really science in the same way that radiometric dating is.  And so it's not the science that got tossed out.  It's a result that was shown to be flawed.  As I said earlier, when we found mistakes in science, it was always more and better science that did it.  It is the single most consistently reliable method.  It is not a pronouncement of truth.  Science doesn't make declarations of truth.  It just says this is the best model based on the evidence that we currently have.  And then we can revise it.  That's why I rely on science.  Doesn't mean I put my faith in science.  It doesn't mean I believe everything that somebody says is science.  One of the worst things about the Internet and the access that everybody has to all this information is science reporting.  If you're a journalist and you're reporting on science, just fucking stop.  I would rather see boring headlines from actual scientists that don't misrepresent the facts than whatever clickbait, ooh, we found the God molecule, the God particle, the God this, the Eve that.  It's ridiculous.  And I know it's because you're trying to sell papers.  You're trying to sell magazines.  But you're not doing science any benefit.  And as we can see from callers today and callers over the last 15 years, you are doing a gross disservice to the community at large because people... Some of them will recognize, as one of our callers did, maybe they don't understand this science well enough.  And yet somehow they still feel compelled and qualified to reach conclusions even while acknowledging they don't understand.  And that's the fault of science journalists.  That's the fault of science educators.  That's the fault of anybody who's putting forth.  this has been debunked when we're talking about an outlier.  Oh, this has shown that there's a God when it hasn't.  set the clickbait aside, let the scientists write their own damn titles, and even if nobody understands them and it's boring, even if they can't even get it from the synopsis of the paper, that would still be better than leading people to think and running around using the word quantum all the time.  Ooh, it's quantum this, it's quantum this.  It's obnoxious that we live in a world where we have more access to information than ever, where we have more access to better information than ever, And there are flat earthers.  There are people who think that a global flood is possible.  There are people who buy into every stupid fucking notion under the sun because perhaps there's too much information and no way to tell what's a reliable source and what isn't.  And no, I'm not suggesting we put a government in charge and this is rubber stamped or anything else.  But at least... Stop with the Reader's Digest clickbait highlighted summaries that are leading people to think that they have an understanding of something when they clearly don't. ",
