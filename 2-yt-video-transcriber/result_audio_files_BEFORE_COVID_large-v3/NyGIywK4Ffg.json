What they don't understand about this campaign is that, in many ways, the freedom dividend is about everything but the money.

And now I've been playing shows, and then this band wants me to play on their show next week, and he was beaming.  When I saw him a couple of months ago, he was frankly not beaming.  He was taking care of his ailing mom who has cancer.  He was quite depressed, seeming.  Sorry, Kyle, but you seem depressed.  And then two months later, he seems like a new person.  I mean, $1,000 a month means lower stress, better health, better mental health, better relationships, more optimism, more arts, creativity, generosity, a more open culture and society.  And so what people don't understand about my campaign is you think, oh, gimmick, $1,000 a month.  This is about expanding the way we see ourselves and our role in society and our value.  Because if we allow the market to determine our value, we are screwed over time because the market's going to turn on more and more Americans. ",

I mean, when you were coming up with these economic structures, you could never foresee things like artificial intelligence that could do near limitless work for next to no additional cost.  So we have to start trying to solve the problems of the 21st century and saying, are you a socialist?  Are you a capitalist?  It's just not helpful.  We just need to take the best of both worlds, if you will.  And the freedom dividend, what I'm describing, sometimes people say like, oh, that's socialism.  It's capitalism where income doesn't start at zero.  Markets function better.  Businesses function better.  Consumers do better when we have money to spend. ",
