            "text": "Hey guys, I just bought some stuff here at Walmart.  I've been here about 10, 12 minutes or so.  And I'm open carrying and I had no issue whatsoever.  So I didn't bore you with the walk-in video, the walk-around video, getting my stuff video.  I just got my stuff, decided to roll on, and we're going to head out.  I'm not going to let them check my receipt.  And just roll out.  open carry.  Quick little video.  You can still carry in Walmart.  Let's see.  No signs.  No signs on this one.  No cigarettes, though.  Hey, guys, this is... Dell City, Oklahoma.  Walmart.  No issues.  We're going to do a little cop watch.  Walk out and that's what we see.  God bless you, sir.  Thank you.  Who?  Yeah, there's one right there.  Oh, yeah, well, you know, I'm just cop watching right now.  Seeing what's going on.  Try to be.  You can go to my channel and watch my videos today.  News Now KC.  I had that topless scooter ride.  I went there and did that.  And then I went to a festival today.  Carried my gun around there.  Everything's good.  I'd just be videoing the police when they're out.  Right.  Yep.  First and Second Amendment rights.  Yeah, I record people that are pulled over by the police for their safety because they'd be killing blacks and all kinds of stuff.  And so we're keeping them in check with video.  Well, we didn't do anything wrong.  I hear you.  I know.  She just got off work.  Just step back in your car and go to work, sir.  I'm standing right over here.  I'm not here to interrupt you.  I'm not even dealing with you.  Alright.  See, they like to push you around.  By talking to you, I'm interrupting him.  Yep.  Yep.  Amen.  Turned into a cop watch.  Just doing an open carry in Walmart.  The big W. They still respect our rights.  What'd they pull you over for?  They giving you a ticket?  Hmm.  So you didn't violate any law and he still, did he ID everybody in the car?  Oh, okay.  Hmm.  Oh, he might be getting you on this fire lane.  Yeah, okay.  I hear you.  Well, that sucks.  No parking fire lane.  Yeah, that could be the issue.  But we'll make sure everybody go home safe today.  This is Dell City, Oklahoma.  And he didn't like me talking to the people.  And I guess they just pulled in here to pick up her family member after she got off work.  And, you know, in fact, I think that because she never got out the car, really, you never shut it off.  It's not truly parking.  Parking is like what you do when you get out and walk in the store.  Yeah.  So when you park your vehicle, you get out and go in and leave it unattended.  Because if a fire truck pulled up, you'd be right out their way, wouldn't you?  Yeah.  I hear you.  Huh?  Yeah, I think you can beat it in court.  Thank you.  Car number 44, Dell City.  See, he didn't like me filming it.  He got upset, said, quit talking, quit interrupting my traffic stop.  God bless y'all.  Well, I'm just standing there.  Get back to work.  You know, go ahead, write that ticket or that warning.  I'm not bothering you.  That's what I, yeah.  They like to push people around, citizens.  Oh, you don't buy a ticket?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Really?  No, but they do hand me up sometimes.  Sometimes they'll try to arrest you with obstruction of the law.  They obstruct a police officer and they get thrown out.  They get thrown out of the police force?  No.  They keep violating our rights.  Yeah.  Whenever the police do pull you over or whatever, record it, they usually do stuff they're not supposed to.  Yeah.  Do you work for ABC?  No, I work for News Now KC.  Okay.  All right, man.  Well, I'm going to go.  There ain't nothing else going on here.  All right, y'all have a good day.  Two fights?  Really?  No kidding?  Out in the parking lot?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  That's crazy shit.  It goes down every day, doesn't it?  All right, man.  Have a good day.  You too. ",
