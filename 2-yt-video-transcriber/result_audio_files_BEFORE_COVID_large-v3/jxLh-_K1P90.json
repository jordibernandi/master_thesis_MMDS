So there's been a lot of controversy on whether or not these hick tips are offensive, but honestly, I just don't get it.  Obviously owning a dog can be a magical thing.  They cuddle with you, you can play fetch, and they'll even hump your leg on occasion.  But I think what kind of dog owner you are speaks volumes about what kind of person you are.  So let's hope I offend some snowflakes here.  The Chihuahua.  That's actually the correct spelling.  You're either Mexican or a basic white girl.  You've all seen that white girl walking around with fake tits with what looks like a rat in her purse.  Oh, no, no.  I wasn't looking at your dog.  I was looking at your tits.  Or how about that Mexican family chasing around a chihuahua they just bought from their next door neighbor?  What's up, SA?  You trying to get one of these, fool?

Have you ever been at the pet store and been looking for something and someone randomly comes up to you and asks you if you need help?

Uh, yeah, my bull Mastiff ate a skunk last night and she sh** all over my truck bed.  Sorry, but I don't care that much about dog facts.  Did you know that if you use biodegradable sh** bags, that actually helps the poop to dissolve more?  Oh, so you're a liberal.  Outstanding.  Oh geez, that leash is so last year.  My husband bedazzles leashes for a living.  I'll hook you up.  If I need something, I'll ask Siri or my veterinarian.  Next we have the latchkey dog owner.  Have y'all ever seen a dog running through Main Street during bumper to bumper traffic looking like it just got done doing a line of cocaine?  That's because its trainer didn't teach him how to be off of a leash.  Do everyone a favor in this world.  If your dog's not trained, keep him on the damn leash.  There's nothing better than when you're at the park and some random person's dog comes running up to you like you're a snack and starts sniffing your crotch.  Oh, hello there!  Oh, oh, okay, okay.

What's your first reaction?  to go and pet it, right?  As you walk up and you're just about to pet it, the dog owner says, what do you think you're doing?  I don't go to your house and start touching all your kids, do I?  yeah that's right.  back off the my dog does shows.  owner.  if your dog does fashion shows or whatever the hell they're called you have way too much time on your hands.  hey darling you want to go dancing this weekend.  no i can't.  i have a show.  oh cool are you going to like a broadway show or a movie or something?
