Now I've actually been saying this for quite a while now because it's an observation that I had made quite a while ago, quite a long time ago, okay?  And that was that anytime Jamie, who's at the Majority Report, is speaking, the looks on the faces of Sam Seder and Michael Brooks are always of this incredible... indifference or just sort of like, oh, like, I can't wait till this is over or any of this kind of stuff.  And I've been saying that for a long time just because it's something that I noticed.  It's definitely odd to say the least.  But here, what we have video of is Sam Seder just absolutely losing it.  Okay, absolutely losing it.  in response to something that was said by Jamie, which is extremely disproportionate response, as well as he seems to have misinterpreted what Jamie was even saying in the first place.  But to give a little bit of a preface to this, they're discussing the video of Nancy Pelosi where she explains that basically in 06, when she had first become Speaker, uh she was.  she was aware that bush lied america into.  you know the war in iraq right.  but uh she just said no i didn't impeach him for that and everyone's like yo what the heck that's like the number one thing to impeach a president for?  um so people are like what the hell.  and so that's what's going on.  and with that said i'm gonna let this go ahead and play.

I believe that that if I'm not mistaken I believe that's the end of his sort of blow up there.  but there is no doubt whatsoever and we'll get to the portion where he actually does his apology for that.  There's no rationale for him blowing up like that.  First of all, what Jamie was saying wasn't even really controversial.  Does Nancy Pelosi put a bad image on impeachment?  Of course!  She took so long to impeach Donald Trump.  They haven't put a monument as one of the charges, obviously.  And then you have that recent, you know, her just talking about how she didn't impeach Bush for the, you know, lying us into Iraq, right?  So she's literally agreeing with you and you lose, you know, you lose your mind or you really go off.  There's no, there's no like defending that.  There's no rationale for that.  And then especially when you start getting into like, oh, it's like, you know, he's sort of the boss there and Jamie's an employee and it's just.  it's kind of awkward when you've kind of got that overhand.  you're just kind of like going off on your co-host.  it's like it's a bit much.  it's a bit much now.  um he probably just you know lost his mind for a second which is fine.  it happens to everybody and he does end up apologizing later on.  but That was definitely not a good sign.  In addition to that, like I said earlier, there has been a just continuous, you know, of dismissal of Jamie's takes from the beginning on the show.  They always seem to have this look of dismissal or indifference or this I don't care type of thing.  They always seem to have that kind of look anytime she's even speaking at all, right?  So, that wasn't good, okay?  And it clearly looked like he was just trying to, you know, go off on something.  It seems like he's kind of going off on like Kyle Kalinske types, funny enough.  The way, the people that he's going after, it seems like, you know, the Kyle Kalinske types when it comes to the issue of impeachment is what it seems like he's really angry at, if anything.  um but he kind of took it out on jamie.  i mean what jamie was saying was you know totally.  um honestly i would deem that common sense.  of course she gives it a horrible image.  you know it's it's nancy pelosi and she took so long to get it started in the beginning.  uh for so long she didn't do anything.  and then there's that recent video of course um but i will also show you guys uh the apology of sam cedar.

You know, it's Adam Schiff and it's it's Nadler to a certain extent as well.  Impeachment, you know, Nancy Pelosi is so far away from impeachment.  She's bragging about not doing it during Bush.  And, you know, she was impeached.  it's, it's well known that she was reluctant to do it.  And so, I mean, I just think that like in the context of, of the, the, I get it that impeachment is not fun for certain people or that people don't aren't psyched about it, but that's, Okay.  You know, I mean, fine. ",

            "text": "So, you know, that's his apology there.  Again, I'm going to repeat, when he's talking about this group of people that he's speaking about that he disagrees with, it very much sounds like he's speaking about the Kyle Kalinske types, right?  The folks like Kyle Kalinske who are like, you know... too much legal jargon and all this other stuff.  and it's it's just too deep and it's not really palatable to the American people etc.  etc.  and so therefore it's not catching steam.  that's who it sounds like he's going off on.  I don't really know why he went off on Jamie because he you know he as you just saw there he says that he agrees with what Jamie is saying.  and again I would be I would find it pretty questionable if you disagree to what she was saying.  she is a bad representative for impeachment.  Nancy Pelosi does suck.  Like, Nancy Pelosi is not good.  And especially on this issue, right?  So the idea of him getting pissed off at this, I'm not really sure what happened.  Maybe it was just something else that went down.  Definitely not a good look.  but, and his apology did have a but in it, and some people are saying, you know, um, you know, there should be no buts in the apology, it should just be like this full-throttle apology, basically, uh, you know, I think that he messed up here, but obviously, you know, it's not like the craziest of deals, he definitely should, uh, I don't know, just avoid doing that in the future.  Definitely seemed kind of weird.  A lot of the comments down here.  Just to read a couple of these.  This one says, I agree the others never back up Jamie and the general tone towards her is dismissive too often.  It's pretty much always that way.  to be quite honest with you.  Michael needs to teach Sam some of his meditation techniques.  Jamie is cool.  Uncle Sam didn't take his cranky pills.  uh jamie and i may have a disagreement.  sam always takes everything jamie says in the most uncharitable way possible something he does far more to people on the left that and he also straight up cuts her off and talks over her constantly.  maybe if he would ever let her get more than a three second sound bite in she can explain her point more.  Damn, Sam, I think your blow-up on Jamie was very unwarranted.  I know that you extensively covered Iraq at a shameful time in our country, but she attempted to make clear multiple times that her point was not what she assumed was.  And so there's just a bunch of comments of people talking about this.  I mean, there's no real defense of what he did.  He was wrong to blow up on Jamie like that.  And they, generally speaking, have an incredibly dismissive tone and just reaction and cadence any time Jamie's saying literally anything.  So those are very clear, obviously.  Sam clearly seems to have this sort of built-up anger at what, you know, like I said earlier, is the Kyle Kalinske types of not being in favor of impeachment.  And so he kind of just took it out on her, which is, you know, not cool, obviously.  But, you know, everyone makes mistakes.  So I'm sure, you know, hopefully he will not do that again.  But let me know your thoughts on this down below.  Very curious to hear them. ",
