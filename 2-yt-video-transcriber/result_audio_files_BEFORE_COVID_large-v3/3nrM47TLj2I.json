I have tried to live my life to the fullest and I have given my life to God and I do not fear what's in store for me.  My doctors have given me about six months to live and during that time I plan to make my transition as smooth as possible while spending it with family and friends.  I've made my time here on Earth a good one, and I hope that all my music continues to live on.  One love.  Yvonne has released eight studio albums with several going platinum and gold.  He will be remembered for his love ballads and debut with R&B singer Kiki Wyans.  His highest-selling album was his first album, My Thoughts, which sold 1.1 million copies in the early 2000s.  So now, however, you know, lupus is not a deadly... Well, in some cases, it's not a deadly disease.  In some of them, it is.  And however, a lot of people were reporting, and it's been going on, that he was sick.  A lot of people have been mentioning his visible health, especially from last year to this year.  And then a lot of people... are saying that his latest performances, they can see that he's been moving super slow, and some quote as a snail, slow as a snail, and has actually been needing help getting off the stage.  Now, he's also been promoting his new album, and he's been promoting it on Twitter.  This is his Twitter page here.  And so he's been promoting this really tough.  I see a few posts saying it's available on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Spotify.  And he's been promoting this lately.  True fans.  I need 100 times.  I need to share it 100 times.  Got my latest music.  Thankful to all my friends.  So, you know, I'm going to give my prayers out to the family and friends of Yvonne.  He's definitely a stand-up dude.  I haven't heard of any scandals and him beating women.  This, this, that, and the other.  At least that I haven't heard.  So, from what I know, he's a stand-up guy.  His music is great and definitely going to live on for a long time.  I want you guys to like, comment.  Let me know what you think about this video.  Peace, peace. ",
