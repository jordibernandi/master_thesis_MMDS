            "text": "Aga in America is a Polish YouTuber known for her raw vegan fruitarian diet.  that has garnished quite a bit of attention recently.  She showed videos of her newest baby boy and it's very apparent something is very wrong.  His legs not developing properly, this poor boy has absolutely no fat on him.  Even when clothed, it's very apparent he is starving.  A Polish girl sent me pictures from Aga's Instagram story of the child without a shirt.  Truly horrifying.  This is the definition of rickets, a disease of children caused by vitamin D deficiency characterized by imperfect calcification, softening, and distortion of the bones, typically resulting in bow legs.  I guess he's just not doing the vegan diet right.  Or is he detoxing?  The only thing I've ever seen her feed her first child, her daughter, is raw fruit.  The child even throwing it out half the time it was given to her.  Ridiculous things like blended slop smoothies in mason jars half the size of the child.  Both her and her significant other look like a pair of Scandinavian bones and clothing.  They can play resurrected corpses in any medieval video game.  Her cuck of a husband is looking more and more like her every day.  I think she might be bigger than him at this point.  The facial development of their first child hasn't suffered much yet, or at least deviated from what is the norm now, probably because The child was breastfed partially, and Aga had some nutrients left in her from when she used to eat animal foods.  At no point in time does this child ever look like she is enjoying or wants to eat her food.  Then these demons have the nerve to go for another child.  Aga, being proud of her skeletal figure even just moments before giving birth, clearly way too thin and deprived of nutrition, When the baby was born, he had a severely receding chin, notably different than the previous child.  Looks like Aga is just about out of those animal nutrients from her past life thriving on meat.  In a video where she announced her diagnosis of a brain tumor, her husband had the nerve to imply they were more educated than professional doctors on certain topics. ",
