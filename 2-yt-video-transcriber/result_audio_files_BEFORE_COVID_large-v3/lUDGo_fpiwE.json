Bro, what are you talking about, man?  Bro, I'm out, man.  That nigga stripping.  What are you yelling at?  Get back to work, man.  I need you to get back to work.  Don't yell at me like that.  I hear you.  I ignore you.  I ignore you.  Don't yell at me like that.  Get back to work.  Dude, the fact... What the hell you think you talking to like that?  I heard your ass, I ignored you.  Hey, what was all that about?  Just do it because you can, right?  What's up, big man?  What's up?  What was all that about, man?  He didn't answer the radio, man.  He just called?  He didn't answer the radio, so we got a couple nights of sirens.  Make sure you go.  Oh, my God.  Seems to be.  these people are getting a ticket for what I don't know.  Possibly stop sign violation.  Could be possibly a stop sign violation or whatever the case, but I just want you guys to notice this.  They're just getting a ticket.  Look.  They blocked the road off.  For a ticket.  I believe it was a stop sign violation.  By the way, that car is there, because obviously they was going northbound in a northbound lane on Northwest Seventh Avenue here in Fort Lauderdale.  And it... This car was going west, like it was turning north.  So it has to be the stop sign, but look at this.  I got a temple.  I got a temple.  I got it.  Yep, I got it.  Hey, Big Nick on YouTube, bro.  You can get the way he park.  Hey, on YouTube, on Big Nick South Florida on YouTube.  This will be up so they can see.  There's no way he can see all that the way he's going.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And the way he was parked, how could he see that?  Big Nick South Florida on YouTube, brother.  You can get this video.  You ain't looking... Tell me you ain't looking me up.  What?  You're not looking me up, are you?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Even if I was, what's the matter?  I just wanted to know.  That'd be crazy.  That'd be crazy.  All right, man.  Bet he was looking me up.  I know he was looking me up.  Whenever you see them doing stuff, folks, call them out on it.  Make them lie on camera.  Big Nick, South Florida.  Accountability.  Out.  What's the name of your badge number?  First Amendment.  You ever heard of it? ",
