            "text": "God answers prayers in an infinite number of ways.  Simply put, God is sovereign, and his authority and his power is unquestionable.  This being said, the Bible demonstrates a multitude of ways God answers prayers, and one of which is through angelic vehicles.  There are numerous examples in the Bible where men and women of God in times of crisis have had their prayers answered by God, through angelic means.  This is why the Bible describes angels in Hebrews 1 verse 14 as ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation.  And Psalms 91 says for he shall give his angels charge over you to keep you in all your ways.  An example of this is when the angel sent from heaven visited Daniel.  In the book of Daniel chapter 10 verse 12, it says, Do not be afraid, Daniel.  He said, From the first day that you purposed yourself to understand and to humble yourself before God, your words were heard, and I have come to respond to them.  But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me for 21 days.  Then Michael, one of the chief princes came to help me.  But I was detained there with the king of Persia.  These two verses clearly demonstrate that praying to our father in heaven can cause angels to be sent to help us in our situation and in our times of need.  I am here simply to encourage you.  Some of you have been through years of trouble, years of challenges.  And some of you listening to me right now are going through who have been through breakups, betrayals, divorces, deaths, despair, trauma, adversity, torment, pain, heartache, misery, calamity on the right, calamity on the left, crisis after crisis.  And you are tired of always being in some sort of trouble.  And there is only one thing you can do in times of trouble.  The Bible tells us what to do in James 5 verse 13.  Is any among you in trouble?  Is any among you in trouble?  Let them pray.  My God, if I say it again maybe someone will hear me.  Are you in trouble?  Have you been broken by a bitter divorce?  Have you been knocked down by a doctor's report?  Have you been disappointed?  Have you lost a loved one?  Are you in trouble?  Have you lost hope?  Is trouble all around you?  Let them pray.  In whatever situation you find yourself in, pray your way out.  Pray your way out when things go wrong.  Pray your way out when enemies are on your trail.  Pray your way out when you are in distress.  God is in heaven, literally waiting on you to call unto him.  He says in his word, call unto me and I will answer you.  Your father in heaven, your father is in heaven, literally sitting at the edge of his seat, surrounded by an innumerable number of angels, with the resources of heaven and earth at his fingertips, waiting and ready to come help you, to come intervene in your situation.  But you do not pray.  The Lord your God is ready to feed you in front of your enemies.  to make them your footstool.  He is ready to deliver you from the trouble you are facing.  But we do not ask.  The Bible says you do not have because you do not ask.  Don't limit God.  Don't limit God by your situation.  I know it looks impossible.  I know it looks like the odds are stacked against you.  I know looking at it from a logical point of view, there's no way out.  Don't limit God to human comprehension.  God is bigger than your trouble.  God is bigger than your child.  He is a God that is able to do exceedingly and abundantly over all that you can ask for.  He is a God that is sovereign in His rule and sovereign in His nature.  He does not have a committee, neither does He have a board.  The enemy will do everything in his power to ensure he hinders your prayer life.  He will do this by making you too busy to pray, by creating distractions to ensure you do not pray.  However, one of the primary ways the enemy hinders your prayer life is through the spirit of condemnation, putting thoughts into your mind to condemn you.  Remember, John 3.17, For God did not send his Son to condemn the world, But to save it through him.  The mind is the battleground.  And the enemy will throw thoughts into your mind.  To say that God will not listen to your prayers.  Because you did this.  God will not help someone who did that.  The enemy will continue battering your mind.  Battering your mind.  Trying to choke your prayer life out.  Whispering into your ear.  God will not listen.  God will not listen to your prayers.  Because you did this.  Because you lied.  Because you're a liar.  God will not listen to you.  God can't love a liar.  Why would God answer the prayers of a sinner?  Through this tactic, he manages to dishearten the children of God from being able to pray for their breakthroughs, pray for their situations.  As a child of God, we need to get to the point where we are assured of the love of God.  The Bible says, for I am persuaded that neither life nor death, nor angel nor principality, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Nothing could stop God from loving you.  This verse literally means that if all the angels and all the principalities and all the powers in the universe was all to come together and go to God and say, stop loving him, stop loving her, God will not do it.  Nothing can separate you from the love of God.  Your relationship with God is not dependent upon your performance.  Your relationship with God is dependent upon what the Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary.  Regardless of what you have done, regardless of your past failures, regardless of your past faults.  Matthew 11 verse 22, come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest.  That is an open invitation.  to all who are weary, all who are burdened, all who are in trouble.  The Lord God Almighty said, come to me.  He will give you rest.  However, I need to put a disclaimer there.  The love of God is not a free pass to live a life of sin, but it should encourage you to live a life that glorifies the Lord God Almighty.  Each day we should strive more and more to be like Christ.  And what did Jesus do at all times?  Time and time again, you'll see in the Bible, He left them to pray.  He'll go for hour and hour and hours praying, seeking His heavenly Father.  The objective of Christianity, the principle goal of being a child of God, is to be more and more like Jesus Christ.  Time and time again, we saw Him going to pray.  and as brothers and sisters of Jesus, we ought to pray.  We all know the story of Samson.  Delilah cut Samson's hair, and the Philistines came in and captured Samson.  He suffered terrible things being a prisoner of the Philistine.  Judges 16 verse 28, Then Samson prayed.  Then Samson prayed to the Lord, Sovereign Lord, remember me.  Please God, strengthen me.  Just once more.  And let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.  Samson was in trouble.  Samson was in trouble and he did what people ought to do when they're in trouble.  He prayed to the Lord God Almighty.  And God gave him strength.  Stop crying about your situation.  Stop feeling sorry for yourself about your situation.  And pray, and pray to the Lord God Almighty to give you strength.  If only you knew how important your prayer life is to your natural life, you would not be so lackadaisical about your approach to it.  Some of the things you are going through are not natural, and have been sent against you.  Your prayer life is not a game.  And some of you may ask, what is prayer?  Prayer is light and darkness.  Prayer is our communication with the Lord.  Prayer is our hope when all is lost.  Prayer is a cry of a heart.  Prayer is the delight of a saint.  Prayer is the bringer of joy.  Prayer is the delight of the Lord.  Prayer is the bridge between you and God.  Prayer is the celebration of a saint.  Prayer is the armor of a soldier.  Prayer is the key that unlocks the gates of heaven, and closes the gates of hell.  In whatever situation you are in, pray your way out.  I believe that some of the situations and the troubles we face not all of the situations and troubles we face but some of them we stay in longer than we have to because we do not pray.  prayer is not a last resort.  when all things have failed you.  when your family your best friend your cat your dog and your squirrel has failed you God is not a last resort some of you listening to me are parents.  I guarantee you that if one of your children was to shout your name in a time of need, your feet would not even touch the ground before you got to them.  What more of your heavenly father?  You think he won't send three legions of angels to fight your battle?  This is the God that loves you.  This is the God that sent his only begotten son to save you.  The same God of John 3.16 is the same God yesterday, today and forever. ",
