Hi beautiful people!  First of all, it's been so fun to see more and more of you guys on my socials, so please go follow me on Instagram at GodIsGrey and Twitter at GodIsGreyXO.  It's such a great way to connect and see you guys and pictures of you guys, so please join me there.  Today, in honor of Pride, two things.  One, I'm wearing this shirt, and two, I wanted to tell you guys the full story of how I came to affirm the LGBTQ community as a Christian.  I know that sentence alone will have some of you on your keyboards with your trigger fingers ready to tell me these Bible verses.  Leviticus 18.22, Genesis 2.24, Romans 1.18, 1 Timothy 1.8, etc.  And please, let me save you the time and effort and promise you that I am very well acquainted with these verses.  And I also want to make you another promise, a promise that I'm going to tell you the truth about the journey that I've been on.  This is not about me cherry picking Bible verses so that I can be popular or cool.  I'm not afraid of not assimilating into culture as a Christian.  I am not falling prey to Satan or conforming to this world.  And I know I'm going to have queer-identifying people listening to this.  And I want you to know off the bat that the God is Gray.  community affirms you.  I affirm you.  I do not believe your lifestyle, as we like to call it, is a sin.  I believe that God loves you madly, deeply, and truly, just as you are.  And now, for any Christians that are on the fence or that believe that I am being an outright sinner right now by affirming the queer community, I really hope you'll understand that I come from the same background as you.  I am just begging you to put your swords down and hear me out.  There's really no harm in diving in to see if anything that I say is valid.  If you want to believe being gay is a sin, you can take verses from the Bible and prove that it's a sin.  If you really want to figure out God's heart on this issue, you can't just pick Bible verses.  You have to do an earnest deep dive.  You have to look at the ancient Greek and Hebrew and you have to pour over this.  The second path is the one that I've been taking for 15 years.  And there's so much to learn.  My research continues to this day.  So a lot of you guys will know my story by now.  I grew up Roman Catholic.  My dad taught me the majority of what I knew and understood about the Bible.  And I had a very deep connection and a passion for that from a young age.  When I was 12 years old, I started going to a born again, non denominational Christian church.  And this was the very first time I ever heard sex, or sexuality addressed in public at all.  My school hadn't taught us about sex ed.  My parents definitely never mentioned sex.  So this was the very first time I was hearing about it.  And what I was hearing was that masturbating was a sin, premarital sex was a sin, and being gay was a sin.  I've noticed there's a new movement in church that sounds a little sweeter, which is, we don't believe being gay is a sin.  God might have made you gay.  We just believe the act of homosexuality is a sin.  In other words, you can be gay, but you can never act on that in a sexual way.  I want heterosexual Christians to understand that this doesn't soften the blow for the LGBTQ community.  Because all this means is that they are required to either live a lifetime of celibacy or to force themselves into heterosexual union.  I heard all of this from the pulpit, from this young age, and I listened.  I took things to heart.  I read the verses in the Bible about homosexuality, and to be honest, I was brokenhearted.  I was like, Wow, I love God.  I didn't know he felt this way about queer people.  I didn't know queer people weren't allowed to experience love in the same way I am.  Can that doctrine gravely harm the queer community?  Yes.  But are those people sometimes heartbroken that we're meant to believe this?  Yes.  And this is why I understand not everyone who believes that being gay is a sin is a bigot.  A lot of us who were taught this message are actually broken-hearted by it, actually took it on with pain and with a battle internally.  This was also difficult for me because I was a massive theater nerd.  So I was friends with a lot of queer people of all different ages and all different backgrounds.  I never grew up in a small Christian community where I actually believed homosexual people were deviants.  I always knew these people to be not only level-headed and kind but monogamous with their partners.  One of my very best friends had been gay since elementary school and my friend who I loved was growing up and going through puberty with me.  He wasn't a deviant, he was just my best friend.  so my best friend who's gay gets nominated for this prestigious theater award and he wants me to be his date.  and i'm all excited.  i can't wait to go support him.  the only problem is that i'm a youth leader at church and everyone knows it.  i am arguing with my biology teacher about evolution.  i'm doing anti-abortion posters in my art class.  i am praying on the front lawn in front of everybody.  i was hook line and sinker and we have youth group on friday the same day as the awards ceremony.  So I have to call my youth pastor and ask permission to skip that night.  When I asked to skip, her answer was no.  She said, Brenda, you're a youth leader.  Everyone is counting on you.  You need to keep your commitment.  I'm so bummed out about this.  And I call my friends and say, I'm so sorry.  I got to go to youth group.  I can't go.  Little did I know this would be the very last conversation we ever had as friends.  He became very distant from me, he never returned my phone calls, and I actually had no idea what was going on.  I was like, dang, I didn't know this awards show was so important to him.  I didn't know until senior year when he finally admitted to me that he thought I hated him because he was gay.  That was not why I didn't go.  I didn't go because I had a tyrant of a youth leader who wouldn't let me skip a night.  But this was the first encounter, the first awakening I had with the fact that my religion, my relationship with God, could actually separate and ostracize me from the LGBTQ community.  Because my friend was wrong about my motive, but he didn't get this idea from nowhere.  At the end of the day, it's true.  If he had stepped foot into that church, they would have sent him to conversion therapy.  They did it to other people.  From this point forward, the LGBTQ issue was just something I didn't want to look at.  Frankly, it didn't affect me.  It wasn't something I had to deal with in my own life.  I moved to Los Angeles.  I continued having a diverse group of friends.  And no one ever asked me if I thought being gay was a sin.  And I was like, phew.  Good, because I don't want to talk about it.  I was able to ignore this very successfully until the 2008 election.  At the time, there was a bill called Prop 8.  California was debating whether or not to allow for gay marriage.  I was very devoted to an evangelical church in Los Angeles.  I have no idea if their policies or stance has changed, but in 2008, there was no separation of church and state, at the Oasis.  From the pulpit, the pastor not only told us to vote against gay marriage, but told us to not vote for Obama.  And to be honest, I was like, I'm voting for Obama.  But I hadn't decided on a yes or no for Prop 8.  You guys, I agonized over this.  I prayed about it.  I sought God.  I was trying to figure out why it felt so wrong to vote against gay marriage.  But at the same time, I felt this weight and this responsibility.  God needs you to vote against gay marriage.  I stood in that booth and I waited.  And I waited and I waited.  And I kept looking up and saying, God, tell me what to do.  And I never felt an answer.  So I left it blank.  I go home, I make dinner, and then comes the moment that changes me.  Any Christian will know that the scripture informs our walk, but an encounter with the Holy Spirit can change everything.  I was sitting in my living room on Sunset Boulevard when I heard this awful noise in the distance.  I couldn't make out what it was, but I got this sinking feeling in my gut.  My hair stood up on my arms.  I felt sick.  I was like, something bad is coming.  I was afraid, but I opened the curtains, and I looked, and in the distance, I could see this, like, parade of vehicles.  They were too far away to see, but I was scared.  I felt like it was dark.  Got closer and closer, the feeling in my gut remained.  And when I looked down, it came into focus, and I was no longer afraid.  I actually... cried exactly like this and I fell to my knees and I asked God to forgive me.  It was a parade of people that were celebrating the fact that same-sex marriage was still illegal.  California had voted against it.  And the reason I cried was because I was so thankful.  It was like God was finally letting me feel the weight of it.  Letting me feel instinctively, in my gut, in my core, looking at God, asking Him to protect me from whatever.  this terrible thing was coming my way.  And that terrible thing coming my way was the rejection of the LGBTQ community.  That it was a celebration of not validating them in covenant relationship.  And I know that won't be enough for everybody and that's fine.  It was enough for me because I knew and I still know and you can't talk me out of it and you can't comment me out of it.  That was God talking to me.  That was God giving me the clarity that I'd asked for for years.  since I lost my relationship with my best friend.  That was the moment that God was like, this is my answer.  This is the way I view this subject.  It feels dark for a reason.  And he will say, Brenda, you're going off your feelings.  You're allowing the devil to lead you astray.  That night, you didn't hear from God.  You heard from the enemy.  And to that I'd say, fear not.  There is so much new material coming out, no pun intended, on the LGBTQ issue for Christians.  To begin, you can watch my video that breaks down a lot of the verses in the Bible that seem to be against homosexuality.  but also there is an array of books, Bible-based books, by Christians, by theologians, and many of them are concluding exactly what I did, and I'm going to link all of those resources below.  I want to encourage you guys, gay, straight, and everything in between, that there is nothing to fear about diving into what you believe.  If you are reading in earnest, if you are looking heavenward and saying, I'm confused, I'm lost, This subject hurts me.  I'm scared of this subject.  That is okay.  This is what the path of faith is about.  If you are going to say a queer person has to change the way they live, has to change the person they love, cannot connect with God, unless they abandon that lifestyle, you better have done more than take these verses out of context and decide, you know, we can do better.  The last thing I'll leave you with, which I'll also link below, is a rich, studied piece by author Sarah Bessie on how she came to affirm the LGBTQ community.  She, like me, did not become affirming overnight.  So please check out all of the resources below.  And anyone celebrating Pride, God bless you and I love you.  God as Grey community affirms you.  I affirm you.  And God loves you beyond measure.  Beyond your wildest dreams.  I love you guys so much.  Please like, subscribe, share with your friends.  Donate to my Venmo or Patreon if you can.  I love you guys.  God bless. ",
