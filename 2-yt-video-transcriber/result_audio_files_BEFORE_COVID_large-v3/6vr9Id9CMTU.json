For whosoever will save his life shall lose it.  But whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. ",

            "text": "As we crucify ourselves, we take up our cross and we follow him because we love him in his strength, the strength of his spirit.  And we walk in an ongoing repentance, you know, with a repentant heart and take up our cross daily because... He gives us new desires to follow Christ, to become more like him because we love him and this is a marriage and we want to become like him.  We don't want the trappings of sin, the besetting sins to continue as patterns in our life because it's holding us back from an even deeper relationship with him and that we trust his promises, that we are a new creation in him and that he does bring us newness of life.  and that his commands are not burdensome.  Why are they not burdensome?  Because it's not some legalistic thing, it's a relationship.  And this process is called sanctification.  This process is called sanctification.  And there's some people that deeply entangle sanctification with justification.  So something you have to understand, we have to, have to, have to understand in this walk with Christ.  that salvation has got three elements to it.  The first element is justification, the second is sanctification, and the third is glorification.  So let's quickly go through these.  Number one, justified.  We are justified by Christ alone.  The penalty for our sin is paid in full by Christ alone at the cross, his death and resurrection.  He shed his blood for the remission of sins.  And when we've put our faith in that gift of grace, we are justified.  We are saved from the penalty of our sin.  So then number two would be sanctification, which is a process as a result of the indwelling Holy Spirit that's in us.  He changes us from within.  This is a lifelong process.  The more we yield to him, the more we grow, the more we gain a Christ-like character.  And this is the way that we grow because we've tasted of his holiness and righteousness and we desire to become more like him because we are in a marriage and a relationship.  So it's not some kind of list of rules.  It is a living relationship with the living Christ.  And step three.  His glorification that once we die in this flesh, we'll receive a new body that will be a sinless body.  And when we see him, we'll be like him.  So that's the three-part process.  Saved by Christ alone, sanctified as a process throughout our lives, and glorified one day to be with him.  He doesn't save in part, he saves in full.  You know, our whole body, soul and spirit are redeemed and regenerated and made new to be with Christ forever.  He is a wonderful saviour.  He is an all-sufficient saviour.  So you've got these people today, especially as a reaction to the hyper-grace movement.  that they kind of start to go into legalism.  You know, they follow lordship salvation and different things like this where they mix up the justification with the sanctification process.  They'll mix it all up.  They'll mix up discipleship with being saved from the penalty of sin.  You know, if you don't go at a certain rate of sanctification that you will go to hell and It's just a real attack on the sufficiency of Christ.  It's a complete misunderstanding.  It's a twisting it round.  And please, folks, if anyone is doing that, please remember who twists things round.  Who's the one that turns things on their head and inverts God's plans?  So please, please think about that.  You know, so we cannot maintain our salvation.  But the irony is that if we have been saved and we have received His Spirit, then He will work in us.  He will, by the power of His Spirit, help us to overcome.  Because He overcame, and because of Him, we are also overcomers. ",
