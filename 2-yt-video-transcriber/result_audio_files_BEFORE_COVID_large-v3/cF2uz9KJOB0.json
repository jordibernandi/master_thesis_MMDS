            "text": "The biggest thing is, you know, you have to have a reason to stop him.  He's not committed any kind of traffic offense, right?  Or had to commit a traffic offense.  That you know of.  Like when he pulled over, did he, you know what I'm saying?  Right, did he signal before he turned, stuff like that?  You know what I'm saying?  No, not.  when he turned over there, no.  I guess I could have made a 1038, but, I mean, pulled 38, but.  Well, I mean, you just gotta, you know, you only have to identify yourself when you've committed a, a crime, or about to commit a crime, and you've been doing a terrorist stop, and you've been committing a crime, and stuff like that.  So if he's not identifying himself, and you've got him for the turnstile he didn't use, you know, however he's, I don't know if he's blocking that drive or not, but stuff like that, then you've got, you know what I mean, you know what I'm saying?  You've got to build up the reason, because he doesn't have to identify himself if he's not doing anything illegal, right?  So that's where he's got to make sure you have reason to be asking for his identification, stuff like that.  That's why I wanted to know what happened up to now.  So from what he's telling me, this guy apparently tries to get pulled over.  Is that what we think?  So he's trying to get pulled over and trying to get pulled over.  So he tries to get pulled over, and then he tries to get you agitated enough to do something that he can sue us for later, right?  Okay.  Okay.  But you have him.  You're looking for \u2013 I just want to sum it up to make sure I'm right.  You're looking for a wanted, I mean not wanted, a missing.  You're watching this guy is acting strange, driving around, driving around.  When he sees you, he's staring, but then he stops, and he stops, and he's stopping like here where a strange friend may have stopped.  He turns off there.  No signal over here.  He didn't signal probably before he pulled over to the side of the road, I assume.  No, he didn't.  But definitely didn't turn.  when he's turning off of, what is that?  Did he turn off here, McCreary, or over on where?  McCreary.  McCreary.  So he turns off of McCreary onto here with no turn signal.  you get out with him, you know, he's acting suspicious, he's already committed a traffic offense, you're asking him for identification, he's refusing to give it to you.  He eventually says that this is already.  after you've already determined, once somebody else gets here, you've already refused to do it, I'm going to arrest you.  Right?  Okay.  I just wanted to make sure I was clear on everything.  And he wanted to talk to me, correct?  Okay.  Okay.  He puts his window down.  Hi, sir.  You said you want to talk to the sergeant?  No, I'm being arrested for not identifying myself.  I didn't find myself.  Did what?  I didn't find myself.  Okay.  She said that when she asked you, you refused.  Okay.  Okay.  She asked me the first time.  I said, no, what did I do?  She wouldn't tell me what I did because I did nothing wrong.  She asked me again.  I identified myself the second time.  The third, fourth, fifth, and the sixth time.  I'm being arrested for not identifying myself.  Okay.  Please review my body cam and then you will see I identified myself over and over.  I'm going to request it.  Okay.  Okay.  Do you want to talk about anything else?  No.  If you're cool with her arresting me for not identifying myself after I did that over and over, then I'm cool with it too.  Okay.  So when she asked you the first time, you said no.  She asked me the first time, I said no.  What did I do?  Okay.  She didn't tell me what I did because I did nothing wrong.  She asked me the second time, I identified myself.  I've been arrested for that.  I identified myself every other time after that.  I put it in her face.  I've still been arrested for not identifying.  I can't do nothing about that.  If you can't review, if you can't stop what she's doing right now, because I know I identified myself, then there's nothing I can do.  The only thing you can do is review.  Nobody can.  You see, I identified myself, and what she's doing is pretty much I'm going to arrest you because I don't like you.  I don't know what she's doing.  Okay.  All right.  Well, sit tight for me.  Go ahead and come back.  So when we review the body camera, you have stopped, you asked for identification, he refused to tell you who he is.  Okay, at that time you're deciding he refused to tell me who he is, he's going to be arrested.  Let's wait until it's safe to do so, correct?  Okay. ",
