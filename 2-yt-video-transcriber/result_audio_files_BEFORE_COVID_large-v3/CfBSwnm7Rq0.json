Advisors to Senator Kamala Harris believe that her plunge in the polls over the summer was accelerated by a withering attack in a primary debate in July by Representative Tulsi Gabbard.  The left and the left and front runner reeling and donors alarmed.  Oh, no.  Gabbert took aim at Harris's record as a prosecutor, saying she was deeply concerned about it.  There are too many examples of sight, but she put over one thousand five hundred people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.  Gabbard also then states she also blasted Harris for maintaining the cash bail system, which she argued disproportionately hurt poor people, keeping prisoners beyond their sentence in order to use them as cheap labor, as well as blocking evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row.  The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and impact in these people's lives, you did not.  And that is so very true because Kamala Harris has very close ties with to the prison industrial complex.  And Kamala Harris actually did keep evidence to keep an innocent man from going to death row.  I mean, you know, An innocent man could have died on Kamala Harris's watch.  Oh, my God.  And this was apparently the quote unquote front runner.  I remember way, way back, even before we got this new studio that on Martin Luther King Day, when Kamala Harris made her announcement, everyone, everyone was saying that she is the inevitable front runner, that she's going to be a big challenger to Bernie.  But oh, no.  Tulsi, the giant slayer.  took kamala harris out. ",

However, this is where the death blow comes in.  Harris's donors were alarmed and urged the campaign to fire back at Tulsi Gabbard.  Harris was also aware that her response was insufficient and reinforced by her advisers, according to The Times.  Harris's advisers were also frustrated at the senator's alleged inability to carry a message beyond the initial script, which once again proves why people like Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, And all the others, really, are just establishment hack frauds.  They don't have what it takes.  They have to have a script, and they have to pretend to be progressives.  Click, copy, and paste Bernie Sanders' ideas, and then assume that no one's going to notice.

Well, hey, look, I'm going to support someone who's actually going to have the courage, the moral courage, the heroic courage to step up and actually call out the establishment.  And in fact, when we covered the fifth Democratic primary debate, Kamala Harris was trying to smear Tulsi Gabbard by saying she's close to Trump and close to Russia.  But Tulsi Gabbard hit back.  What Senator Harris is doing, unfortunately, is continue to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I am making.  That is so true because Tulsi Gabbard has an argument.  And yet, yet, yet, the DNC establishment is choosing to attack Tulsi Gabbard and still somehow keep the establishment fraud candidates in the race.  Remember, Just right now, this just happened.  The Boston Globe had Tulsi Gabbard polling at 6%, and yet the DNC establishment chose to ignore that poll.  So Tulsi Gabbard technically could have made it on to the sixth Democratic debate.  Right now, it's going to happen in December.  There's still time.  She qualified in the donors, Tulsi Gabbard has, and she's qualified in three other polls.  She needs to qualify in one more to make it to the sixth Democratic primary debate.  Yet Kamala Harris is there, but yet her campaign is... failing.  She's running out of money.  She's closing up shop all over the country.  She's hoping for a one-hit wonder in Iowa, which will not happen, period.  So, again, I also want to mention one other thing, too, that caught my attention.  This has to do with the fact that Kamala Harris's top aide, her name is Kelly Melchenbacher, she mentioned about how she was one of her top aides for the Kamala Harris campaign and actually had to step down because, this is a quote from her, \"'This is my third presidential campaign \"'and I've never seen an organization \"'treat its staff so  poorly.'\".  And this is just a different article altogether, but it goes into detail basically stating that Kamala Harris's campaign has no idea what it's doing.  And this should give all of us hope because Tulsi Gabbard is still in this race and she's making the establishment afraid.  But yet their only excuse, especially for Kamala Harris's campaign, is to blame Tulsi.  All that Tulsi Gabbard did is tell the truth.  All Tulsi Gabbard did is lead by her values.  And yet Kamala Harris... probably somewhere out there thinking, I had this in the bag, when in truth, she never really did. ",

Okay, so some disclaimer.  Before the election started, I predicted that it would actually end up between Bernie and Kamala.  And I didn't know Tulsi was going to enter the race at that point.  So I made a lot of predictions over time if you watch the show.  The one that I've gotten the most wrong is thinking that Tulsi, not Tulsi, that Kamala was going to rise and Elizabeth Warren would kind of be more supportive of Sanders.  And in fact, it's kind of... Flipped that entire spectrum.  And that's thanks to Tulsi Gabbard, who, of course, is responsible for everything.  So I just want to say that this is very funny.  It's very reminiscent.  I'm sure some of you may remember to what happened with Hillary Clinton, except it's kind of happening in real time versus like after the fact.  where everything that happened with Hillary Clinton wasn't her fault.  She couldn't take responsibility for the piss-poor campaign that she run.  Just like Joe Biden told Mexican or immigrant families to shut up and vote for Trump if they don't want to vote for him.  Well, we saw what happened with Bernie Sanders and the DNC and that entire thing with Clinton.  It feels like The same exact sour grapes are happening with Kamala Harris and Tulsi Gabbard.  And I, for one, welcome it because she was so full of herself after that debate.  I still remember her saying, I'm a top tier candidate.  People polling so low, they don't even matter.  Now who's polling well?  Now whose campaign is falling apart? ",

I mean, seriously, let's do one more with the Kamala Tulsi campaign.  That's it for last before we move on to the next story because I think it's hilarious.  Who's laughing now?  Who's on top?  Whose campaign is shutting their doors?  Whose campaign is falling apart?  In fact, one of Tulsi Gabbard's \u2013 correction, Kamala Harris, correction.  Kamala Harris' top aide is actually with Bloomberg now.  I mean, that's hilarious.  Tulsi Gabbard is still gaining momentum.  Tulsi Gabbard is actually someone who's actually in this race, and the DNC is so afraid of her that they're willing to ignore something by the poll from the Boston Globe, which is also owned by the New York Times.  Oh, surprise, surprise on that one.  Yeah, so again, Tulsi Gabbard's winning.  kamala harris is failing her campaign is fracturing.  they're closing down shops.  i mean they're hoping for that.  one hit wonder in iowa.  it's just.  it's just not going to happen.  so tulsi gabbard in the long run is a giant slayer and she isn't going anywhere period no debate about it.
