            "text": "The cost for borrowing cash in exchange for U.S.  Treasuries overnight, known as repos or repurchase agreements, jumped to as high as 10%, an increase of fourfold.  And as a consequence of this, the Fed just dumped $75 billion into the economic system or into the banking system.  I don't understand this, and I wanted to find somebody who did, so Professor Richard Wolff is with us, our old friend, the economist and author of numerous books.  Professor Wolff and democracyatwork.info, his website.  Welcome back to the program.  Can you explain to me what's going on here? ",

            "text": "Well, I can try, but partly the mystery is the deliberate decision of the Federal Reserve not to explain.  Maybe it doesn't even know what's going on.  But to be simple about it, banks in the United States and some large corporations find themselves day to day sometimes short of money.  They have a special need, they have some special problem, probably one they didn't foresee, but they just need the money for a day or two to sort it out.  And so there's an enormous market for short-term borrowing.  And by short-term, I mean a day or even sometimes a matter of hours.  And there is a market that has developed over the years where these kinds of large borrowers can go into the market and borrow short-term money, as I say, for a day or two or three or four.  What suddenly happened Monday morning of this week was that the normal availability of that kind of a loan, which was running in the neighborhood of a little bit over 2 percent per year for a few days, shot up.  There wasn't the money available in all the usual places from all the usual banks who had more than they needed to lend it to the banks who had less than they needed.  And so suddenly the ones who needed to borrow the money, because their need was urgent, had to pay not 2.1% or 2%, but suddenly, as you correctly said, it went up to 10%.  Then it wobbled for a while at 5%.  So the question is, what is going on to make it suddenly so much more expensive to borrow short-term money?  And let's remember, any bank that has to pay that kind of extra interest will pass the costs on to its customers, at least as far as it can.  Here comes the mystery. ",

            "text": "Here comes the mystery.  Here comes the mystery.  Why?  The big question that everybody wants to know is what in the world is going on.  And the answer is, we don't know.  We're getting from the financial, usual financial sources, all kinds of calming explanations.  The federal government is running a big deficit, so the Treasury is printing lots of Treasury securities, and somehow people have been buying those, and those people would have otherwise lent their money overnight, so there's a temporary shortage.  Whatever it was, the Federal Reserve got extremely anxiety-ridden, knowing that high interest rates were what led us into the crisis and crash of 2008.  So what they did was to pump many tens of billions of dollars, literally created the money, flooded the banking system with this new money by buying the Treasury securities that banks already owned in order to replace money in their accounts for the Treasuries that the Federal Reserve was buying.  And that's the kind of behavior you see in a government agency, that much money literally in minutes, that usually signals, and I'm going to be very polite now, extreme uncertainty, strains, and unusual behavior in financial markets.  Given that recession is what's on everybody's mind, everybody can imagine, and they should, that this might be the beginning of of something genuinely scary. ",

And one of the concerns, which has been heightened by the Federal Reserve's failure to give the public any kind of official analysis, not that we would necessarily believe them, but it is very troubling that they're not even offering, which of course fuels the notion that they can't tell us what's going on because it would worsen the problem, namely that we have a 2008 situation.  And let me remind everyone that your memory is correct, but it was more serious, as we then learned, despite the calming denials that were issued then, much as they have been over the last 20 hours.  The reality was that everybody in the big financial know, the big banks, the big corporations, had finally figured out that we were on the edge of a major meltdown.  And it was too dangerous to lend money, you know, overnight, even to the biggest, safest banks and corporations that you had lent such money to for years, because you realized, and this was particularly after the collapse of the Lehman Bank, that whoever you lent to might tomorrow morning, before they paid you back, declare bankruptcy, and you would never see your money again.  to deal with that risk, suddenly lenders were very hesitant and borrowers had, as you correctly said, suddenly to pay a four times higher interest rate than they were used to because of the nervousness that was beginning to grip financial markets.

I mean, the cause was all these structural insufficiencies that you and I have talked about a number of times over the years.  Is it possible that the triggering event, instead of being the collapse of a bank like Lehman, or the rumor of a collapse, a potential collapse of a bank, which makes a lot of sense given what you just said, is it possible that in this case, though, it's not that, that it is the possibility of a war on behalf of Saudi Arabia with Iran?

            "text": "It's that, but I think a better way to look at it is with the old adage about the straw that breaks the camel's back.  It's never this thing or that thing.  If you look at the trade war between the United States and China and the havoc that it is wreaking across the world of manufacturing, not just in the two countries, but in India, in Germany, and all the other countries reporting the negative effects of that, and now you see what drone warfare can do to the oil in the Middle East, and you remember that the world is due for another capitalist recession because they happen every four to seven years, and we're now nine years or eight years out of the last one.  You put all of those together, and then you begin to have to worry whether what might in other circumstances have been a relatively minor glitch.  is this time the sign that finally all of that bad news and bad events happening out there are beginning to make major players, financial and non-financial alike, take extraordinary steps like being unwilling to lend money so that suddenly the bank you went to to get an overnight loan tells you, no way am I giving you a loan, no matter what your interest rate is.  So you then have to scurry to the next big bank.  They will say, well, we're not as worried as the first one.  If you pay us 10% instead of 2%.  2%, well, then we'll give it to you.  You're going to then begin to see that this isn't a flash in the pan, a one-shot gig.  This is the beginning of the next big downturn.  And until the Federal Reserve, A, says otherwise, and B, gives us real evidence, we have to keep that as one possibility for what's going on. ",

The second thing we should look at is how many tens of billions of dollars the Federal Reserve is pumping in to get that effect.  And the third thing we should look at is whether it's working in the sense of going back down or it's bouncing around.  If it's bouncing around low, up and down, then that's probably a sign that the nervousness is spreading and that it is now going from one bank to another.  And that can go very, very fast.  my guess is we'll have a much better idea where we are at the end of this week than we do now, unless the Federal Reserve's anxiety covers all of this over with some news blackout, which I would take as a very, very scary sign.
