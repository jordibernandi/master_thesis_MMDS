            "text": "My first glass of water of the day, that's what I usually do.  I chug it when I get up.  I got up about six minutes ago.  These are the first words that I'm speaking for the day.  Day three in a three-day fast, starting with a hard reset of doing a water fast.  Yesterday, I started putting the salts in because I was feeling a little bit weak, which is what you're supposed to do because of going into A deprivation mode.  And a fat burning mode.  And past the irritable bitchy stage.  Now zero hunger.  Day number three.  Tomorrow I begin eating.  And I only do carnivore for the month of May.  From May 8th to June 8th.  I started with a three day water fast.  Last week I told you what the water fast is.  I have water.  in the morning and throughout the day.  I chug the first glass of water.  I usually will drink two to three liters of water.  In the water, I put no salt.  Just the tiny, like.  I'm kidding you.  Let me just show you something.  This is, I'm not kidding you.  When I say a pinch, all right, can you see this right there?  You're taking one eighth of that.  That much.  That much.  And I'm putting that in the water.  A tiniest pinch of the boron.  A tiniest pinch of the baking soda.  A tiniest pinch of the Himalayan salt.  All goes in one glass or a bigger pinch if you're going to make a liter out of it.  I chugged the first glass.  okay sip it throughout the day.  yesterday it was actually cold here outside so when it's warmer I tend to drink more water.  I did not even sweat a little bit yesterday so two liters of water was what I had yesterday.  day number three wicked dreams all night.  just someone stole my bike.  kind of dreams and I was like looking for my bike.  What else do I feel on day number three?  I feel I can go for five days because I've done this before many times.  There was a time when I would do this two or three times a year.  But I feel like I could easily go for the weekend.  Easily.  I'm not going to.  Tomorrow I start eating again and I'm doing 100% carnivore for the month of May into the first week of June.  So May 8th to June 8th is pure monk mode.  The best monk mode is if you go away from people, period.  I still have to be around people.  I still have to work.  So this is kind of a working monk mode.  A real monk mode would be taking time off from work, getting away from all electronics, not checking any email, and literally... Literally getting back to nature, living out in nature.  That's important.  And learning how to enjoy solitude.  So you're unplugging from the social matrix.  You're unplugging from all the bullshit, from advertising, from any influences.  The only influences in your life, in pure monk mode, will be nature and God.  That is it.  Your body will not be telling you anything.  Do you realize when you eat carbs, your body speaks to you?  When you eat sugar, your body speaks to you.  When you have caffeine, your body speaks to you.  You want nothing speaking to you but nature and God.  You want no influences whatsoever.  That's what pure monk mode is.  Working monk mode, where you still have to go to work every day and interact with people, is different.  You have to modify some things.  So tomorrow, this is what I'll be doing.  After work, after work, I will have one meal.  I get out of work about one or two o'clock tomorrow.  I will have one meal and I will do the rest of May and June with OMAD, which stands for one meal a day.  And you can eat for an hour.  I might extend that window to two hours because this is my first full monk mode month.  And that means you eat in a window of time.  I will be eating just meat.  That's all I will eat.  And I know the weight will go down.  I know the muscle will improve.  I will be lean.  In one month, the body transforms.  It just becomes a completely different body.  I have a different body now than I did one year ago.  One month from now, I'm going to have a different body than what I have now.  My meditation time is prayer and reading Proverbs in the Bible.  That's it.  That's all I'm doing.  As far as anything else, not going out with friends, not partying.  I'll be doing that over the summer.  But this is kind of like a pre-summer routine.  Let's get started.  Do you have a porn addiction?  I never did because I had the real thing in my life, so I never felt the need to... I never felt the unnatural need to look at other people involved in sexual activity.  Does that mean I'm any better than the person who has a porn addiction?  No, because I actually got involved with the sexual activity, which I feel is not... Pure.  It wasn't pure.  So I violated myself.  And it's taken me years and years and years. ",
