            "text": "Good rising brethren, this is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, I'm going to give all praises to the Most High, Yehawah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yehawah Shai, I pray that the Most High blesses this lesson this evening, gives more knowledge and understanding of the events of the past, in order to understand the events that are currently coming on the Earth.  So we're getting much better understanding of the things that are soon to come on the earth.  The opening, you know, is really starting to make so much more sense.  How important it is for us to understand the events of the past, the actions these other nations have taken to assume our identity.  And then today, we got people who are supposedly our brethren, who are complicit with the enemy to keep us from bringing the two sticks together.  Once we bring those two sticks together, we can more efficiently figure out the events that are soon to come on the earth in the near future.  This is going to be a quick video because this is just confirmation of the Holy Spirit who has been sent to lead her people back to the Most High.  It's just amazing to watch how the Most High works.  It's been quite a few months, I think about nine months or so, since we brought out the Book of More.  And what's been crazy is seeing how before the Book of More and when we were only using the Bible, many people in the nation would do extra research and they wouldn't just take people's words for things.  And they seemed like many of the brethren in the movement, in the awakening, seemed to be very intelligent and willing to go the extra mile to go deep into research.  But as soon as we started moving away from the Bible and looking into other books as well, and especially when we brought out, when the Most High brought out the Book of More, and revealed it as being our book.  That's when many people in our nation just lost their minds.  Many people were just attacking us, or attacking myself, and talking about how the Book of More talks derogatorily about so-called black people, how the Book of Mormon says that black skin is a curse.  And I'm sure I've even gotten a couple of comments even in the last day or two asking that same question.  Well, we can't read that book because it says that black skin is a curse.  But these same individuals, I've even heard people, the elders in other camps and saying exactly the same thing, just parroting the same lies over and over again, showing that they weren't willing to really do any research.  They were just willing to look at the words that were just printed right there on the page and just run with it in order to keep our people out of the second stick and in order to keep our people from reading the testaments of Joseph and the Northern Kingdom.  So what's amazing is what you'll see with the Most High is this.  He'll let you dig your own grave.  He'll let you fall on your own sword.  He will let your own words fall pretty much bury you.  And that's exactly what the Most High has been doing.  Many of these so-called brethren have attacked me and attacked the Book of More pretty much for a couple of verses.  They want to throw the whole baby out with the bathwater because it said that black skin was a curse.  They wanted to use those couple of sentences in order to throw out all of the information.  So it's just amazing how the Most High just let them.  These are certain individuals that have appointed themselves into positions of leadership.  They appointed themselves leaders. ",
