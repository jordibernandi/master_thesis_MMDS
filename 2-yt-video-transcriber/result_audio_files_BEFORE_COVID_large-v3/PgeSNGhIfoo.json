            "text": "What is up, everybody?  I am so excited that I'm getting so many subscribers already to the channel.  I think it's somewhere up in the 60s right now, which is pretty impressive.

That's what's going to help me grow and be able to deliver more content and maybe upgrade this equipment a little bit get a little bit more audio and whatnot in here.  but uh but i do appreciate everybody coming around and listening to my story and i love reading the comments.  i'm gonna try to get back to some of the comments here soon um and once i get a little bit of free time.  but today I want to tell a story about, I met a guy the other night while I was driving Lyft, and we had a good conversation.  We had a bit of a long drive.  It was late at night, so luckily the guy was pretty cool and we had a good conversation about this, but what we're going to talk about is when women stop bringing anything of value to the table other than the flower.  I mean, they think that the fact that they're giving up to you and letting you have sex with them, that that is in exchange for everything else that you should be giving for them.  I see it all the time.  I mean, I see it with my ex-wife.  Slowly but surely, everything became my responsibility after a while.  It started off with me doing parts and her doing parts, and then her parts weren't getting done properly, and I would take on little bits and pieces.  Paying the bills.  The money was all there.  We had the money to pay the bills.  Why weren't the bills being paid?  because she was in charge of them.  so you know things were getting shut off.  gas was getting shut off electric was getting shut off not because we didn't have the money to pay the bill just simply because she wasn't taking the time to pay the bills.  um Hell, I want to say by the end of it, it was laundry.  She used to do the dishes.  That was one of the things she would do.  We would have piles of dishes in the sink that weren't done.  The dishwasher would need to be emptied and she wouldn't want to take the time to empty the dishwasher because that was a pain in the butt.  Towards the end of the marriage there, I felt like I did it all.  Taking out the garbage, cutting the grass.  Hell, I was a mechanic on the side.  I would get yelled at for working on our cars and saving us a ton of money.  So here I am.  I'm out in the garage.  I'm tearing apart a car, saving us maybe over $1,000 in fees from a mechanic to work on the car.  and I'm getting yelled at.  How much longer is this going to take?  These kids are getting annoying.  Things of that nature.  Bitch, I'm out here saving us a ton of money, right?  I'm out here putting money back into our pockets, and you're rushing me?  You're rushing me after a couple of hours?  This is... Anyways, so... The conversation I had with this guy was pretty funny because we were, we started driving and we just kind of started, you know, basic conversation and he was texting somebody.  And then finally he just, I heard him back to just kind of give it like, I'm like, what's up?  And he goes, man, these women are crazy.  And I said, bro, you don't have to tell me about that.  I mean, if anything, I'm the guy to talk to about the crazy women.  I'll be more than happy to have a conversation with you about how nuts they are.  So he, you know, he kind of kicks off with telling me about his girl and how his girl's a little nuts and whatever.  But the way he was kind of talking was like, he keeps her in check pretty good.  But for the most part, she's still annoying.  And we'll hear later on in the story how we definitely figured that part out.  But really, he was telling me about his friend.  So his friend, he said, was talking about getting married.  He's about to propose to his girl, right?  And he was telling me how he just, he tells his buddy, you shouldn't do this.  His buddy pays for everything, apparently.  So the picture he painted to me was that they got a pretty nice life going.  They got a nice house.  They got a couple cars.  He pays for her car and he pays for his car.  You know, he's putting a good life together for him.  He works his butt off.  He pays all the bills.  He's giving her a good life.  And all she does is treat him like crap.  I don't get that, right?  Right off the bat, I'm like, why?  Why would you want to be with somebody who puts you down and takes all of your money and your resources?  If you're not going to knock me down and take my money, I'll just... That's like a criminal in the streets, right?  Those are fighting.  You know, you come up to me in the street and knock me down and try to take my money, we're going to be fighting.  But we let these women do it all day long.  And he's telling me about how, you know, if it wasn't for this dude, this chick wouldn't have anything.  Common story, right?  I mean, even these chicks, if they do get a job, they love to get these meaningless jobs, right?  I mean, these jobs are nothing.  And they treat them like they're the world.  I mean, they'll be out there making $35,000 a year.  They'll treat that job, they'll talk about it like, oh my God, I'm a CEO of a company.  No, you're not.  You're barely doing anything.  They get these mediocre jobs to get them through, especially these single women.  Once they get through the divorce and they start pushing those 30s, which is where I'm at, and they start trying to get back into this, they're dating.  They think that they're dating in their 30s.  They're dating like they're a little kid again.  they're running around with these dudes.  they're just blowing money left and right.  they can't be good with their money at all.  they're just horrible with their money.  that'd be another video all in itself of some of the dumb things that my ex has spent her money on.  uh and i've seen other people's.  you know girls spend money on but so they can't be good with their money.  they're not bringing anything to the table job wise.  uh they don't want to do any of around the house anymore.  right they're about doing the laundry and doing all those the the basic things at the home but they want to put their hand out and collect from you.  So he was telling me about how she just had a birthday recently and that she used his buddy's credit card to buy herself a bag that she wanted for her birthday.  So used his money to buy herself a bag, but then told him that he still is responsible to buy her.  He still has to buy her a present.  I don't even get that.  So you just used my money to buy yourself an expensive gift and I'm supposed to buy you an expensive gift.  Do you want to marry that?  You're going to put a ring on that?  Why?  Why are men so scared to lose a woman?  Why are we so afraid?  I heard something the other day that said if you want to get back out there and you want to get your confidence back up, because that's the thing that all these guys are missing, right?  These women are beating the confidence out of us.  They're beating it out of us.  They're just knocking you down notch by notch by notch and creating the little simp that they want to take care of them while they're out getting pumped and dumped by other dudes, right?  Because the cheating is just insane.  I mean, back in the day, I used to always think it was a guy.  Guys cheat, guys cheat, guys are pigs.  And for a while there, I think that they were.  Guys were just going out cheating.  Now, man, the women are just dirty, dirty.  They are so fast to jump ship and go after some other dude for I don't even know.  Like I said, their ultimate goal is to create this guy at home.  So they'll take a guy who was the exact person they wanted, right?  Let's say they wanted that bad boy, whatever it may have been.  They'll find that guy.  They'll marry him.  And then they will beat him down until he is the complete opposite of what he was in the first place.  And then they bitch about it.  How do you take something, completely change it, which, guys, don't do that, man.  Don't let a woman change who you, don't let anybody change who you are.  I don't care if it's a boss at work, if it's a woman, if it's your parents, whoever it is, do not let people change who you want to be.  Be yourself, right?  These chicks will take you, beat you down, create you into some little pussy simp that just takes care of all the bills and pays everything and gives her a nice car and gives her money to go buy herself a present while he goes out and buys her a present too because he's so bowing down to the flower.  Why?  Why would you want to do that?  Why would you want to be put in a situation where somebody is going to consistently and constantly try to change who you are and then bitch about you whenever they change you?  It makes no sense, guys.  It just makes zero sense.  The funny part about the story was, so we get to talking and I'm telling him, I said, here's my look on it all.  And I told him about MGTOW and I directed him to some of the videos and my own videos for him to come and take a look at online.  But the funniest part of the whole story is I said, well, where are we heading now?  I mean, it was like almost midnight, right?  And we're heading to the complete opposite end of town.  And we're talking about, you know, I was talking about how, look, man, if that's all you're going to bring to the table is sex, if that's all you're going to bring for me, I can get that easy.  I can go out right now and get laid if I really wanted to, right?  If I really wanted to put in the time to do it, it's not hard.  Getting laid, I mean, sex is just given away these days.  It's not hard to get.  And at the very worst case of it, I'll just go pay for it.  I mean, if I'm really desperate and I really need to get off, which I don't, but if I needed to, I'd rather just go pay for it because at least then I know what I'm getting.  I know that I'm going to pay you, we're going to do it, and it's going to be finito and you're out and we're done and I don't even have to look at you again, right?  So then he starts laughing.  He's like, right.  He goes, it ain't hard to get ladies.  Like I'm on my way over to my side chick's house right now.  That's where you're taking me.  He's like, cause my broad was getting on my nerves.  So I'm leaving her and going over to my side chick.  Guys.  Don't let getting laid be the only reason that you're going to stick with a chick that's going to treat you like crap and try to beat you down and change who you are.  And definitely don't get married.  Please do not get married.  I mean, right off the bat, we're talking 50% of all marriages end in divorce.  And those are the ones that people get divorced.  On top of those ones, you're going to have all the people that just hate each other and just stay living together.  Stay living in these horrible, toxic marriages and just waste their lives.  Don't waste your life on a woman.  Just don't do it.  Don't waste your life on anybody.  You've got to be your own person.  You've got to go out there and get your own thing.  You need to get laid.  Getting laid is the easy part.  Start talking to chicks.  If you're not confident right now, get yourself to the point where you're saying something to a chick at least four or five times a day.  Just make yourself do it.  When you're out in public, just tell a girl that you like their hair, you like their shoes, whatever it may be.  Just get used to conversing with women because you're going to be surprised.  It don't take much.  to get these women's attention because so many guys are so weak right now.  They've been beaten down by their women.  They've been destroyed.  All of their confidence is gone because these women treat them that way in hopes of locking them in to taking care of them.  And it's working.  It's working.  I mean, it's not working on us.  We're smart.  We're paying attention to this.  And there might be somebody right now who's watching this.  that's thinking, man, I'm in one of those relationships and I get it.  Hopefully you're not married.  I mean, that's number one.  Hopefully you're not married because that's a lot easier and hopefully you didn't have kids because then you can at least walk away from a cold turkey.  Please, if you're at that point, do it.  It'll be the best thing you've ever done.  But don't let some woman run your life.  Don't let some woman change who you are and beat you down and turn you into something that you're not.  All so that they can just go cheat on you and find the version of you that they already had, that they completely changed, right?  And then they'll try to do it to him, right?  They'll leave you go to him.  They'll beat him down.  Man, I watched my ex-wife destroy a guy after me.  Destroy him.  financially, emotionally, just destroyed the guy.  And the sad thing is, the guy loved my kids.  He was a good dude.  I mean, he took care of them.  They went out.  They did a lot of fun stuff.  I mean, he was getting them season passes to Disney when we lived in Florida and season passes to Busch Gardens and taking them on cruises and buying them new bikes at Christmas.  And this dude loved these kids.  And she just shit on them.  Shit on them.  don't be that dude.  do not fall into that world of treating a woman like a goddess just because she lets you have sex with her.  don't and i'll tell you what you want to know.  if you're in one of those relationships i'm going to tell you right now.  i'll tell you if you need to know.  if you don't know for sure if every time you have sex it's almost like a chore for her and it almost just becomes like a fine and she just lays there and just lets you go to town.  i'm telling you right now that's not what she wants.  She don't want that.  She's just letting you have it.  If she wanted to be with you and wanted to be having sex with you, it'd be totally different sex than that.  Right?  That's why this dude was going over to his side chick's house.  I bet you his side chick fucks him.  His wife, he's probably going to go home and listen to her whine and bitch and complain.  And maybe, maybe, hopefully, he gets a chance to have sex with her.  Right?  Don't do it, guys.  You're better than that.  Get out there.  Get your own Take care of yourself.  Put your life together.  And then you can worry about maybe, maybe introducing some chicken to your life.  But you've got to make them work for it.  Why are you working for it?  MGTOW for life, guys.  Please, like I said, if you like these videos, give me a comment, give me a like, give me a subscribe.  I really appreciate it.  I'm having a lot of fun doing this.  I'm hoping you guys are enjoying me talk.  And like I said, we're going to grow this channel and we're going to get some more content in here.  And I'm looking to have a lot of fun with this.  So until next time, stay single. ",
