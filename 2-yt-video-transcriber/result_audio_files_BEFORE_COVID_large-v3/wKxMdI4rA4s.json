            "text": "Bye.  Bye.  So we have an issue this time out of Ontario, Canada.  See everywhere we're at in a diaspora in the four corners of the earth.  This is why we have to cover these stories to let you know we're dealing with the same issues and problems no matter where we're at.  Just as much as here in the United States, we have shopping while black, what happens in Canada as well.  And I've had many brothers in such a state that listen, y'all not the only ones dealing with racism when it comes to these people.  Trust me, we're dealing with police brutality, and I heard the Toronto Police Department have been notorious for police brutality.  Well, let's get to this particular Facebook post and show you the video after this post.  So, the sister by the name of Lisa Calderon stated, I was racially profiled in Old Navy, at Square One Shopping Center today.  I felt uncomfortable, so instead of exchanging my merchandise there or buying a white dress to try it on, I decided to go somewhere else.  I even went as far as to voice my opinion to staff before leaving the store, which at this point, I wouldn't have understood if she asked about my shirt.  Then when I was at Brown's looking for shoes, a staff by the name of Stephanie said she'd seen that I did not walk into the store with my top on and they saw it on camera.  and that I still had the price tag on it.  She then proceeded to put her hands on me in front of security guard Caseta.  She gives his number.  After getting very irate, they advised her to let go.  I went back to the store and had to wait.  After she had already said she'd previously seen the video, her manager Gillian Pyton apologized, took my info after approximately 15 minutes, and said they would get back to me with the district store manager.  Guys, I cried because I never thought in a million years this would happen to me.  I would have been more calm and understanding if she didn't accuse me first.  I would have been happy to show my receipt, especially because I voiced my racial profile complaint to an employee before I left the store.  This needs to stop.  Stephanie had no right to aggressively lay her hands on me and accused me of stealing a $13 top.  Has she not done that?  The situation would have ended quietly.  So she puts a lot of hashtags, old Navy shopping while black racial profile and Canada racism.  So let's go ahead and roll those clips. ",

            "text": "Sister Lisa, let me, let me tell you something, sis.  Just, I gotta tell you this and I gotta tell every black person this because I see this so many times when the people say, I never thought that would happen to me.  Let me let you know something.  As long as you walk in this skin and long as certain individuals are in charge, you're going to possibly deal with that.  Expect it.  Expect the police to harass you.  Possibly expect them to ask you silly questions.  Expect people to treat you different.  Expect it.  There's one of those things that like they say, you stay ready so you don't have to get ready.  And then when they do approach you, you don't get emotional.  I'm not condemning you sister.  I'm not.  I'm just saying that we got to stop getting emotional.  Now the Stephanie chick, She would have put her hands on me because the moment she grabbed my hand, she probably would have lost her hand because I would have jerked my hand away from her so quick.  She was like, ow, you're hurting me.  Like you put your hands on me.  At this point it's self defense.  I have a right to have my own hand.  You ain't no cop.  You ain't crap.  So get your hands off me.  It just as I would have did that.  I would have, but see, sometimes they know who to try.  Always understand that.  That's why I try to keep a look about me when it comes to certain individuals that you don't want to really mess with me like that.  I'm a nice person.  I get along with everybody, but I can easily turn that the other way as well.  Now, when you walk in these stores, you see them looking at you funny.  You see them following you.  I'll make sure to make eye contact with them.  at the time period, I would walk up to them and say, Hey, I noticed you've been following me in this store and I won't let you know I saw you.  So I'm going to leave the store and I'm not buying anything.  And matter of fact, I'm going to make sure to inform your district manager and also I'm gonna get on Twitter as well and let them know that I was being profiled in a store.  I was being followed.  I was planning to spend money that day, but I walked out because I felt criminalized.  And that's what you have to do.  You have to let them know.  And matter of fact, when you let them know, turn on those cameras and let them know you got to expose these people at any time.  they do this to you.  Even in incidents like this or whatever, always put it out.  They do not want to be labeled discriminatory.  Trust me, they don't.  That affects their bottom line.  So yes, the Stephanie individual was fired from her job rightfully so.  And we'll put up the tweet from old Navy so you can see old Navy here.  They went on and handled that.  So as you see here, say we're so sorry about our customer.  Lisa called the wrong, had an unacceptable experience in one of our stores and we apologize for letting her down.  We investigated quickly and thoroughly and the employee involved in this situation is no longer with old Navy.  So I didn't want to get through all that corporate mumbo jumbo.  They talk about it.  They don't tolerate.  We don't want to hear all that.  We just want to hear the bottom line.  She was fired.  So she was overstepping her bounds.  You know, I guess she felt deputized.  I can go ahead and just grab a black woman anytime I get good and ready.  with no evidence.  And even if you did have evidence, you call the cops, you call security, you let them handle her.  You don't suddenly go put your hands on her.  See, you touched the right one, Stephanie, you touched the right one because there'd have been some other sister.  You'd have got knocked out and rightfully so because you don't have no authority to grab your hands on nobody.  You just don't.  Now, some people say, well, why would people do that?  Well, you have a right to self-defense.  When someone is grabbing you like that and won't let you go, well, to me, you're trying to illegally imprison me.  You're trying to kidnap me or something.  You're holding me against my will, so I have every right to defend myself at that point.  That's how I feel about it.  I didn't tell you to put your hands on me.  I didn't invite that confrontation at all.  Bring your evidence, whatever it may be, but don't put your hands on me.  Call the cops.  They the ones should be to settle the issue, right?  But she got fired for it, overstepping her bounds.  And that's good for her.  I want to say this once again, if you live in a Western nation, black people expect this expected.  Now you may never see it in your lifetime.  You may not.  And great for you.  You don't see it, but expect it because I don't like seeing videos when y'all just flipping out and say, ah, doesn't think in a million years.  Well, That's a bad expression, because most of us are not going to live to see a million years, but I get the point.  I'm just saying that we've got to understand the systems that we are living in, whatever country that we're in, whether you're in Europe.  Now, I'm not saying in Europe you deal with this a lot, but Oprah Winfrey dealt with some racism in the story before.  And that's Oprah Winfrey.  And that was actually in a European nation.  That wasn't here in America.  Go figure.  Right?  So we can't just say it's America.  It's over there too.  Whether you're in Canada, France, wherever you at, expect it, ladies and gentlemen.  Expect it.  I just want to keep reiterating that to expect it.  See me, I expect everything.  So it doesn't shock me.  I just know like I'm waiting for one to do it to me.  Oh, I'm waiting for one.  Trust me.  Y'all don't realize I'm waiting for one because I'm going to make sure everybody know who they are, what store it is, what employee.  And I may even give them a little one and say, you want to go down that route?  Let's see.  You seriously want to go to that route?  I said, okay.  And then once I cut that camera on that, that's the end of it.  I'm not like a fool, but I guarantee you I will make sure that everybody know who you are and why people shouldn't shop with you anymore.  I will guarantee you that that goes to any business that mess with either me or someone in my family that I know of.  I will make sure people know who you are because we have to hurt those businesses when they do this.  That's how I feel about it.  Discrimination shouldn't fly in no way, form or fashion.  But leave me a comment.  Let me know.  Think about this particular story out of Canada.  Stephanie was fired, that's great.  Old Navy took care of the situation, but we have to make sure that we make these people respect us at all times.  We talked about this in our Decolonizing the Mind series, okay?  Because if we don't make these people respect us, they will continue to do what they're doing, which you see in this video. ",
