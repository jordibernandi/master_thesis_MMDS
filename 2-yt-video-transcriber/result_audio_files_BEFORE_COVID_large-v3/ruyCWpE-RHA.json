            "text": "Today, I'm going to be discussing what China is telling its citizens about the gold standard and what they need to prepare for.  I'd like to thank you guys for your support on the Patreon.  The link is down below in the description as well as other support links and other things down below in the description as well.  Alright, so I have this article from the Global Times.  It is a state-run news agency, which means that it has to be approved by the Chinese government.  before anything is posted.  so I find that interesting.  so but to me this is telling their citizens what's getting ready to take place.  right so far this is the one that I found so far just like I showed you about the central bank talking about going the global reset and the gold.  you know they put that announcement out there and here is China doing the same thing but they're doing it but they're telling their citizens All right.  World needs to prepare for return to gold standard as Washington disrupts financial order.  The one thing that everybody discusses is the dinar.  And I've told you guys before that I think the dinar is the global leader.  It could happen before the gold standard.  I don't know exactly how it's all going to take place.  All I know that there's going to be a break in the system and the break in the system could be the gold.  and other resources that the country's currency is based on that.  I don't know exactly how it's going to go down.  But the gold standard and the global currency reset is tied in, in my opinion, to the dinar.  The safe haven property of gold has fully manifested in recent weeks.  Spot gold hit $1,535 an ounce on August 13th, the highest level since 2013.  I believe the gold price could reach as high as $1,800 an ounce in the future today.  And in the meantime, there will be increasing discussions about the world's return to the gold standard.  I'm going to skip some.  So what would be the outcome?  The most significant change is a return to the gold standard.  As capital surplus and overcapacity have extended great pressure on the world market space, the world financial system is also trying to adapt to the huge change which is centered on the status of the dollar.  From the perspective of the global financial system, the dollar is a super currency that has a strong backing of global geopolitics.  The status of the super currency is supposed to be unshakable, but the problem is that the U.S.  itself wants to give up this status and pursue a future characterized by U.S.  Donald Trump freestyle, therefore leaving the world market in uncertainty.  I'm going to skip a little bit more.  First of all, digital currencies.  Government in various countries are making efforts in this regard, and market forces have also cultivated various digital currencies like Bitcoin and Libra.  But they are far from being universally recognized and trusted by the global markets, and they are also far from... winning the support of major economies.  And that is true.  Like when it comes to the cryptocurrencies, you know, I was trying to trade some out of one account because they were closing down this particular crypto exchange or whatever they were doing.  And it's been a total nightmare.  And that's one of the things that I don't like about the cryptocurrency.  It's just not, you just, it's just something to invest in.  It's not really something that is, reliable or in reality.  you know i need to go to the store and i need to buy things.  you know i need to get gas.  you know those are things i cannot even do with any cryptocurrency.  you can in some places but for me right now i can't use it.  there's a lot of other people that they don't even talk about it.  you know if you all the people that you know.  they don't talk about it on an everyday basis or talk about cryptocurrencies.  you know.  so it's just one of those things that It's just, to me, it's come to a stagnated place, especially with all the rules and regulations from all the different countries.  There's no unilateral thing on cryptocurrencies across the world.  All right, so I'm going to keep reading.  Second, regional currencies, including the euro, politicians around the world actually missed many opportunities after World War II because world politics seriously disrupted global financial order.  But no one would admit that the result is the weakening of the status of regional currencies like the euro.  Then what's left is the gold standard.  After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the questioning of the gold standard has never stopped.  The gold standard essentially represents a financial order.  When the old financial order faces collapse, it is necessary to create a new financial order.  When the U.S.  decoupled the value of the dollar from gold, it actually committed to take on the responsibility of world finance, based on which a new financial order was formed.  It was this financial order that has allowed the U.S.  to enjoy huge development dividends.  Now the U.S.  is unwilling to continue in assuming the fulfilling of such responsibilities for the current world financial order, and Trump has continuously intervened in the operation of the Fed and the global financial market order.  This development points to the necessity of seeking and building a new financial order, which is the fundamental basis for the reemergence of the gold standard in the world financial market.  Now, what have I been telling you guys about the President of the United States and gold?  He's been saying it.  He's been saying we need to go to the gold standard since before he was elected.  And he's been saying it during his after he was elected.  He's been saying it for the long been tweeting it.  There's many different examples where they talk about going back to the gold standard.  So the gold standard is an effort by the world market and financial system to balance the Trumpian future.  It means that the U.S.  can take its own path and Americans will have the right to look after themselves, but other countries around the world will also have the right to make their own choices.  In other words, this will be a process of rebalancing the world financial market, forcing the U.S.  to face up to the problems.  It needs to make the choice, fulfill the obligations and responsibilities for international finance or abandon it.  international status of the dollar thus allowing the dollar to become a common currency.  well i like to say something about that.  i mean yeah we don't.  it's not our responsibility for individual countries.  there's a lot of corruption there's a lot of things that go on and a lot of economies all around the world should be a lot better.  if you get rid of the corruption and that will that will resolve itself.  in my opinion there there are simple judgments and projections made from the Perspective of Geocapitalism.  For the  U.S.,  the gold standard is a choice that cannot be avoided.  The existence of choice matters a lot.  Countries around the world would take back their gold reserves stored in the  U.S.,  and there remains a big question mark over the U.S.  response.  I've told you guys about that before.  If another country decides to go to a gold standard, how will the United States respond?  Or will the United States go gold standard first, and then other countries will respond?  I don't know how it's all going to take place, but I think there's a plan in place, and I think it's being forced into this position where central banks are going to have to say, we give up, we're going to have to go back to the gold standard.  There's many different scenarios.  Central banks would increase their holdings of gold reserves to prepare for the return of the gold standard.  Gold prices will rise and dollar assets will enjoy.  energy prices will also be affected.  Now, what has happened?  I've shared this many times from 2010 to 2014.  There was a gold buying spree.  And since 2018, there has been massive amounts of gold buying from the central banks.  They have been.  the central banks have been buying and buying and buying gold.  So what are they telling you?  It's essential banks would increase their gold holdings.  They're.  central banks would increase their holdings of gold reserves to to prepare for the return of the gold standard.  besides that the most important thing is whether u.s.  is willing to accept any big change or wants to return to the old financial order and abandon its current path.  it remains to be seen and requires time and observation and that's all we're doing.  right.  but everything points to that.  everything points to that.  so they are telling their citizens get ready there's a. There's a very strong possibility in the way that it's headed to is that the United States is heading back to the gold standard.  All right.  So I'm telling you guys that government over there can tell their citizens that the gold standard is coming back.  You know, there's a strong possibility that we should look at it, too, in every country that you're in.  And that's why in some of my past videos, maybe six, seven, eight months ago, I talked about when this global reset takes place, not every country is gonna be ready.  Not every country is gonna be able to come on board.  Some of them may be left behind and their currencies may not change until later on.  So there is a lot of countries that are sitting back waiting to see what happens.  So there might be some economies out there that are devastated when they do change over and it's gonna be a slow transition Period for them.  So once again, you know, for the naysayers, you know, this is just another piece of evidence, another piece of the pie from from a foreign newspaper that is telling their citizens what to prepare for.  Right.  World needs to prepare for a return to gold standard as Washington disrupts financial order.  And so that's what as we look to see what Trump has been doing and how he's been talking about the feds.  Right.  And the central banking system, Trump rails against Powell a day after the Fed cuts rates for a third time this year.  And I'm not going to read the whole article.  He just says that one most important thing, China is not our problem.  The Federal Reserve is Trump cheated and we will win anyway.  So and then, you know, he's just bashing him.  And I've showed you guys there's a. there is a database you could go to to look at all the different tweets.  And in all those different tweets, you can see it's just like almost, you know, there are.  there are weeks that it's just almost on a daily basis.  He's just bashing the central banking system.  He doesn't like it and he wants to change it.  And that's what he is going towards.  That's what they're moving to.  And that's the direction he's planning it one step at a time, forcing countries to do certain things.  In this article, Trump says Fed not China does more harm to the U.S.  economy.  Just another headline.  And one of the most important things, as I discussed in a couple of my videos in the past couple of weeks, is the central bank, the Federal Reserve, has tons and billions of dollars just to do as they wish.  And our government doesn't necessarily always have that luxury, especially when people on both sides of the aisle are complaining about certain benefits for poor people, or they're talking about a wall, or they're talking about whatever the issue is, and we don't have enough money.  The central banking system has, you go back through the Obama years, and you're talking about trillions of dollars.  So where's all that money coming from?  Just to try to keep the economy stable.  Okay, now this article I want to discuss just for a little bit because I think it's important because it does deal with the Kim Clement prophecies and the stock markets and stocks that you're invested in and all the different areas that you may be invested in.  that's heading towards the global reset.  Now it says here, Trump says U.S.-China trade deals close but market nosedives.  The trade deal between U.S.  and China is imminent and only delayed by the need to find a venture for a signing ceremony, according to Donald Trump.  Almost after two years of wrangling over U.S.  import tariffs on Chinese goods, which sparked a tit-for-tat row between the world's largest trading nations, the two sides were close to a comprehensive long-term trade agreement, the president said.  All right.  So a trade deal between the U.S.  and China is imminent and only delayed by the need to find a venue for a signing ceremony.  So we are on the verge of the U.S.  China trade deal.  Right.  And I've showed you different financial experts and stuff like that, that when this actually happens, the stock market is going to take off.  So that's what we hope, you know, and this is all kind of weird because I know what Kim Clement said about the whole, you know, Asian deal.  And I don't know, just the way that these things are heading, it's kind of hard.  Some of the pieces to the puzzle just don't seem to fit, right?  Like this U.S.  trade deal, right?  There's supposed to be a great wealth transfer.  This could be a second wealth transfer.  There might be an additional wealth transfer.  He talked about the wealth transfer from China.  But he also talked about the dinar as a as a wealth as a type of wealth transfer.  So is it two different things?  Is this going to happen?  And then a financial world collapse?  Or is this all going to take place at the same time?  How is all this going to take place?  And if China knows that they're going that U.S.  is going to gold standard, what's in the deal?  So this is pretty big news.  Hopefully they are that close that all they need to do.  They've already got all the paperwork ready to go.  All they have to do is sign it.  If that's all they have to do, folks, then then we are very close.  So hopefully this time that there are nobody will back out of the deal and they can get it done.  And that for whatever that we are invested in, maybe this I don't know how it's going to take place, but.  And all the different events that may take place.  But a lot of us, when this China deal is done, may make a lot of money.  So that just remains to be seen.  All right, guys.  I thank you guys for listening to the very important update.  And with that being said, Twister Christian out. ",
