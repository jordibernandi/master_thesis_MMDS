            "text": "Because I hate myself, I am doing a second Bill Maher video in the same week.  Not necessarily something that I think is probably a good idea, but nonetheless, here we are.  So as you all know, he brought on Crystal Ball to push back against his idiocy, but he also brought on filmmaker... Michael Moore.  And, you know, Michael Moore, my feelings on him are mixed, but mostly positive.  Michael Moore, for the most part, he still, he seems to have his finger on the pulse more so than other elites.  But I will say that there have been times where he's had takes that are questionable, to say the least.  So I want to say maybe it was in March of this year on Instagram, he made a post on where he floated a celebrity for president, and I'm blanking on the celebrity, but I believe it was someone like Tom Hanks.  This is the person who can rally the Democratic Party base, someone who's beloved by the American public.  So I don't remember who it was specifically, but I know that it was a very weird take.  With that being said, Michael Moore still has a lot of great things to say, and I think that he does make a contribution to the progressive movement that is, for the most part, valuable, even if at times he kind of veers off in a weird direction.  But on Bill Maher's show, he actually decided to challenge Bill Maher and push back against Bill Maher's newfangled centrism.  And this was really interesting to watch. ",

            "text": "So that goes on longer.  And let me just say that Bill Maher I mean, I don't even know what to say.  After that clip, he went on to criticize members of the squad and say that their approval rating is low and that America doesn't like them and that if Donald Trump actually makes them the face of the Democratic Party, then this will be bad for Democrats.  See, the problem with Bill Maher is that he only views politics through the lens of personality.  It's all about the personalities.  And first of all, he doesn't mention that their approval rating is maybe low because Fox News has been relentless in attacking these ladies.  But to him, it's all about personality.  The policies that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar and what they're talking about, that doesn't matter.  It's their personalities.  And since Fox News says that they're bad.  then, you know, they must be bad.  So he's just an imbecile.  But basically, the point that Michael Moore made, which I think was poignant, was that why now, all of a sudden, after being a progressive, you're saying, wait, pump the brakes.  I mean, we finally get this vocal left-wing movement in the country, which is what we needed, which is what you previously said we need.  And now, all of a sudden, you're against them.  You're shitting on them.  Why?  And Bill Maher's response, idiotically enough, was it's not where the country's at.  Really?  We elected Donald Trump.  The establishment has failed Americans.  They're ready for change.  They're ready for bold progressivism.  And if you look at countries throughout the world, in every country where there is a Trumpian figure, Brazil, the UK, there is always someone who is progressive, who is incredibly popular.  Left-wing policies, vocal social democratic and socialist policies are the antidote to fascism and right-wing populism.  That's the only thing that actually can permanently defeat Donald Trump.  Okay, so the fact that Bill Maher doesn't get that by now, it shows how naive he is and how he's just not engaged.  And what's odd to me is the prime example he brings up to show why Americans aren't with progressives.  Medicare for all.  He says Americans don't support Medicare for all.  They don't support Medicare for all.  Have you read any poll lately, Bill?  Any poll?  Most polls show that Medicare for all is overwhelmingly popular.  And some polls even show that a majority of Republicans support it.  But he goes on to lie about Medicare for All and frames it as taking away health care.  So that's why it's not popular.  Obama said, if you like your doctor, you can keep it.  And now we're going to take, you know, insurance away.  You know, it's interesting to me that all of these people, they just one person will say it and then everyone else will repeat it.  It's like a telephone, but for corporate talking points.  Now, I don't believe that Bill Maher is meeting, you know, in a smoke-filled back room with the Democratic Party strategists so that way they can all get on the same page and say the same thing.  But, you know, it's just, it shows you that his level of political analysis is very superficial.  He just parrots what he hears on the mainstream media.  That's it.  That's all, you know, he does.  That's the extent of research that he performs.  Research, if you even want to call it that.  Medicare for All is incredibly popular.  And if you look at this poll from the Morning Consult, if you explain to people that even if we take away their private health insurance but replace it with Medicare for All where they get to still see their doctors and go to the hospitals that they want, it still is popular.  So for you to say Medicare for All is not where the American people are... That's laughable.  Look at all the policies that Bernie Sanders is proposing, and they have majority support.  Raising the minimum wage, Medicare for all, a Green New Deal, a federal jobs guarantee.  The writing is on the wall.  Bernie Sanders is the candidate that can basically defeat Donald Trump and put us on the trajectory of social democracy.  But to Bill Maher, he probably buys into all of this fear-mongering that he sees in the mainstream news.  He just thinks, Well, you know, if you run a far-left candidate, Donald Trump is going to pounce and we're going to lose.  and, you know, having Trump for another four years, that wouldn't make me feel good.  I mean, look, Donald Trump and the Republican Party, they can move as far to the right as they want, but the minute that people on the left start inching closer towards social democracy, that's when people on the supposed left say, hang on now, pump the brakes.  It's a double standard.  Republicans can become as extreme as they want to be, move off a cliff, And it doesn't matter.  Nobody's really calling them out for that, including liberals.  But when leftists say, hey, you know what?  Maybe we should have a healthcare system that's comparable to our neighbors just north of the border.  Maybe we should actually pay our workers a living wage so that way we reduce poverty.  We actually have a middle class again.  That's when we are the ones that are scolded.  It's just, it's irritating, and I can't stand Bill Maher, and he has permanently damaged his credibility here.  So I think that at this point, Bill Maher is just too far gone.  I don't think that anything would make him see the light.  I mean, Bernie Sanders, even if he were elected, and Jeremy Corbyn was elected, and Lula was freed, and throughout the world, social democrats are... introducing these policies that are changing people's lives for the better and restoring faith in you know the political establishment.  he still would probably find some reason to shit on them.  the man's an idiot.  he.  he's out of touch and i think that that's evident.  i'm just glad that he's still at least open to bring on people like michael moore and crystal ball who are willing to challenge him because i guess that's the best that we can hope for when you have someone who is this out of touch.
