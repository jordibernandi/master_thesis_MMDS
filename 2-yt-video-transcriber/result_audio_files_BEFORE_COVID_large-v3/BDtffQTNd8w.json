You can blow up those pipelines.  They go like this and you're not going to fix them too fast.  You can do a lot of things to those solar panels, but you know what you can't hurt?  Coal.  You can do whatever you want to coal.  There's another promise that is deeply important to me, and I know it is deeply important to you.  We are going to put our coal miners back to work. ",

The Black Tool Mining Company in Gillette unexpectedly shut down yesterday, locking out nearly 600 workers.  This after the company filed bankruptcy on its Eagle Butte and Bel Air mines.  The Casper Star Tribune reports the two mines are the fourth and sixth largest producing coal mines in the country.  Miners were sent home suddenly after a bank denied the company $20 million in financing to continue operations.  The Star Tribune reports that court documents show that Black Jewel owes $500 million in liabilities, including $6 million to employees. ",
