It could have been a, quote, effect called a wind set down in which strong winds, a little over 60 miles per hour, create a push on coastal water, which in one location creates a storm surge.  But in the location from which the wind pushes, in this case the east, the water moves away, end quote.  Now, there's a number of objections to this hypothesis, which include its location and how accurately we're able to reconstruct what the area would have looked like in the time Exodus was written.  in fact the author of the hypothesis argues that it wouldn't have taken place in what we in the modern era considered to be the red sea but instead the lake of tanis which at the time was a shallow brackish lagoon.  i also very much doubt moses was stretching his hand out to perform a magic trick.  i suppose it's possible that someone observed this natural phenomenon didn't understand what was happening and built a story out of it which may have grown with each new telling.  Anyhow, I just thought that was kind of interesting. ",

An organization catering primarily to the Jewish Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox communities actively encourages and facilitates polygamy, claiming the practice will help reduce the number of single women within their communities and at the same time give Jews an edge to the demographic race against Arabs in Israel.

Working at social services, I can absolutely tell you that there are a lot of dysfunctional, abusive relationships out there between people of the opposite sex.  Some of those toxic relationships are between two people who feed off of each other.  Of course, the opposite is true, and you can find a lot of happy, loving relationships where the couple strengthen each other.  The same can be true about same-sex couples.  Also, it shouldn't be up to a woman to make you better.  Take some responsibility for yourself.  You're an adult.  Fucking act like it.  Anyhow, that's all I really want to say about this interview.  I think Ben is terribly backwards about a lot of things, and while I could criticize a lot more of the things Ben has to say in this interview, I don't think my sanity could handle it.
