A feather is made of things like a fingernail and the hair that I used to have on my head, but I won't pull it off.  But, you know, feathers have a remarkable structure which is only seen at the microscopic level.  Ask this gentleman or the lady who is asking this question, how come that when you put feathers back together again with a brush over the fingers over the barbs, they come back together again?  There is an amazing mechanism of hooks going one side from each barb and barbules, they're called, these are mini-barbs.  On the other side, they've got ridges on, so the hawks are sliding over the ridges, but at a microscopic level.  So, yes, it's true that scales are also made of another type of keratin, and so the evolutionist says that keratin from a scale is changed into a keratin of a feather.  But where did the structure come from? ",

            "text": "Tell me, how did it happen?  This guy wants to know, how did these things come to be?  But we do have a lot of archeological evidence that shows how feathers have evolved over time.  They actually evolved out of archosa- sorry, archosaurs.  Feathers are most widespread in theropods.  Those are the carnivorous type of dinosaurs.  While there are some herbivores that did develop some feather-like structures, it was mostly in the theropods.  They first presented as like these straight kind of wire or needle type of feathers.  From there, what happened was, was they ended up branching out and making these, I guess, a little bit more simplified kind of feathers, which by simplified feather, what I mean is, is that they didn't end up being like as thin or as fine or anything like that as the feathers that we have now.  There would be a bit more coarse and a bit more, I guess, thick feathers.  like thicker of the needle kind.  So from there, though, they continued to evolve over the hundreds of millions of years into the feathers that we have now.  And in case you didn't know, they didn't originally evolve so that things could fly.  That's not the original intent of feathers.  That is just like a happy byproduct or use of them.  Because originally they were used to camouflage the animals in their environment.  They were used to like attract members of the opposite species.  And they were also used to like help their young survivor, help them survive in some kind of way.  That was the original intent of Feathers.  And it just so happened that like when these particular animals would run or whatnot, they could probably get pretty good speed boost by using the feathers in order to catch the wind and propel themselves forward.  That promoted the longer armed kind of animals that had feathers because beforehand you had the animals, they were too big, like body wise and their arms were too short to actually have any kind of flight or anything like that.  So the use of the feathers promoted lighter weight, animals and longer armed animals so that they could start to fly and glide and all these other things.  and so that's how feathers formed.  but this guy wants to say that they are like Designed by a creator in some way.  and this is not at all the case for feathers because they we have a archaeological evidence that shows how they came about naturally, how they weren't perfectly designed.  This guy's argument is that God handcrafted feathers to work like they do.  The fact that we have archaeological evidence that proves him wrong shows that it is indeed not designed by the Creator or anything like that, or irreducibly complex, which is going to be a popular topic for this video.  Also, the argument from design is the main argument that they use in different ways.  this guy right here doesn't know what the he's talking about. ",

None of that proves that it was designed or handcrafted by a god when we have archaeological evidence that shows otherwise.  Just a little bit of extra information here.  We do have genetic evidence for scales being the precursors for feathers.  We've been able to identify the genetic markers for the feather DNA.  And in fact, in 2017, a scientist was able to actually turn on these genes in some alligator embryos.  And he observed the like sort of the proto needle like feathers starting to develop in these alligator embryos.  So not only do we have genetic evidence that links scales to feathers, but we also have paleontological evidence that shows dinosaurs were the first ones to have feathers in which they evolved from that point on.

            "text": "first of all he's giving the human knee way too much credit for it being perfectly designed or anything like that.  the human knee is an approximation of a four bar linkage system and And it's not perfectly designed because it neglects a lot of important mechanical features of this four bar linkage system.  The human knee doesn't have rigid rods or anything like that that he's suggesting.  The ACL and the PCL are very much rope kind of things.  They aren't rigid.  They provide a tensile force to it, meaning that they can only really pull and provide that kind of force.  And then the meniscus actually provides the compressive force of the knee.  But besides all of that, we're actually able to compare homo sapien knees with the knees of animals that are extinct, like other animals in our own genus, the homo genus.  And then we can also use that to compare to extant apes that are alive now.  And, wouldn't you know it, just like before, the evolutionary theory wins out because as we go back in time in our own lineage, we see the knee becoming more and more ape-like.  And that's indicative of our common ancestor, who was also an ape, that ended up branching off into the different apes that exist now, us being one of them, and then the other apes that are out there, the bonobos, gorillas, and all that other shit.  But what you find is that the original Homo-ni looked eerily like the ones that are in the apes that are extant now, that are alive in zoos and shit now.  That's what we would expect on the evolutionary theory.  But on this fucking theory that he has, that it was specially crafted, I mean, I don't think that we would see, like, that kind of progression into the past, nor would we see the common ancestor having similar needs to the apes that exist now.  We would see more special design, I guess you could say.  And it's just not special. ",
