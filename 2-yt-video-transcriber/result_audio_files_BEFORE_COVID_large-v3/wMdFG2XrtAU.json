Side by side, let's get back to basics.  This is our way, sis.  I can feel it.  come together now.  I've been working out.  I never want to settle down.  I've been blessed.  I got to use it for the better now.  Got to hold you down.  You ain't scared to drown.  Let his waves wash over me.  brain filled with poetry pray for my soul to keep solace is soberly declaring so openly known so locally but truthfully i want to scream it globally.  totally dude i don't mean to be rude.  maybe it's my attitude of how i dropped out of school.  ever since i Man, man, it's changed my whole world.  I don't know about you, and I know it's not cool, but I'm here to break rules.  I was hopeless, losing my focus, under hypnosis, but it was all bogus.  Love that it shows us, praying it sows us, nothing below us when you love Jesus.  Too blessed to be stressed, having Jesus, even when I repress.  Coming out, you would think that it's recess, how I hit the reset.  I could never be pressed over the procedures, cause I can't see yet.  open up your eyes to the whole matrix.  plenty other lies getting caught in hatred sign other times.  let's get back to basics.  this is always this i believe i'm born again born to win.  shine my light cause i'm owing him now and then give my thanks and forgive my sins.  my condolences to all that are wrong.  no i'm better man.  talk a big game.  no let a man let a man.  he my rock.  so Generous, better man, I reflect on my rhetoric.  So my weather did, livin' our life, never settlin'.  Oh, sometimes when you livin' in the tops, everybody got their eyes on you.  Oh, it's fine, good surprise, so blind, life really is a test for you.  They care about you, everything you've been through, you can be safe too, it's true.  Make a break.  You can come through if you want to.  Boy, I'm brand new.  Yeah.  To a blessed beastress.  Hey, Jesus.  Even when I repress.  Come and now you would think that it's recess.  How I hit the reset.  I could never be pressed.  Overdose and see shit.  Cause I can't see it.  Open up your eyes to the whole matrix.  Plenty of the lies getting caught in hatred.  It's time that it's time.  Let's get back to basics.  This is our way, sis. ",
