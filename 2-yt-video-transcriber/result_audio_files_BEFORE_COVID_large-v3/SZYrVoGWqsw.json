When he was asked why he did it, he said, I know what's best for the nation's foreign policy, and I'm going to act on that.  So that degree of hubris, right?  You go in loving your country, embracing the flag, you're there at the CIA for the right reasons, but now suddenly you've come to this belief that you are anointed, that you are somehow the guardian of the republic.  Beyond the defensive nature that the people, your government has given, has anointed on you to actually do good things to support the Constitution and support policy makers.  Now you think that you're actually a king or a queen behind the scenes and you will move the levers of power and you will decide who gets briefed on what pieces of information or you don't brief certain pieces of information.  Let me give you an example.  So I worked an issue that I can't talk a ton about but an Asia related concern And what we were briefing the White House was that what we as the CIA were doing in terms of our covert action operations were incredibly successful.  But I actually knew that that wasn't true.  So I sat down with the analysts and I said, help me understand why you all make this judgment.  They're like, we don't make that judgment.  We don't believe that's true.  So I collated all this information and I presented it to our, what we call the seventh floor.  And I said, you know, sirs, what we are presenting to the White House as effective isn't.  And they said, well, you know, the song and dancing.  And then they said, look, why don't you breathe that downtown, right?  Knowing that I had absolutely no ability to do that, right?  So they just sort of, it took an issue that they knew would be problematic for the agency, for themselves.  They lied about it to the NSC and to the White House.  And they decided what was best for America's foreign policy as it relates to that particular country and that particular issue around weapons of mass destruction.  So it's a tiny little example of how the deep state can decide what a nation should or shouldn't do.  The rubric that I think has been crossed, that kind of stuff is more typical Washington.  What hasn't happened, certainly in my lifetime or my recollection, is a guy like Brennan and Clapper deciding that a politician or someone running this one, President Trump in this case, candidate Trump in this case, was not good enough to assume the presidency.  So they were doing things to kneecap his administration before, or I should say his election, his ability to become an elected official. ",

So they briefed it to President-elect Trump.  And the very act of doing that and saying, hey, you should be aware that this exists, suddenly gave the hook for the press to run with this story that we have a Russian agent sitting in the White House, the FBI and the CIA, you know, they believed enough in this document to brief it.  And then, of course, The fire was set.  The brush fire took off.  The hysteria was launched.  But what's amazing is the next number of days and the next couple of weeks, every one of those bastards, Comey and Clapper, Brennan, all of them said, oh, but the dossier, we don't believe it.  It's just rumors.  Well, then why'd you brief it?  Why'd you spread it around Washington?  Because you knew.  That it would cause a brush fire.  You knew it would set this nation on fire.  And you knew that the Trump presidency would likely never recover from it.  And in fact, John Brennan told a crowd here in Los Angeles that President Trump would no longer be in office, an interview he gave, by the end of 2018.  He told a bunch of these Hollywood elites, don't worry about it.  Trump's going to be gone by the end of 2018.  Thank God John Brennan was gone.  And now he's under criminal investigation by AG Barr.

They have now made the American people reasonably concerned about a degree of politicization that they weren't aware of.  or that they thought would be impossible.  So they have really solid, not only the reputation, but the ability of the FBI and the CIA to go out and do the good work that they need to do.  We do, in fact, need an FBI and a CIA to do the good work that they do.  But it's reasonable for an American to step back and say, maybe we shouldn't have these guys because they're so... highly politicized.  So I think that Brennan and Comey and Clapper and that whole cabal that was involved in these shenanigans in 2016 should be very worried.  John Durham, a very, very smart man, and I think AG Barr is playing a long game on this one.  I think he's letting Comey go on some of the smaller stuff.  I mean, he's hitting him hard in some areas, and the IG has called him a dangerous man, a man who's had a dangerous precedent for the 30-plus thousand former and current FBI employees.
