And speaking as a lesbian my own darn self, all I can really say is, boys.  Ewww.  Let's do this.  Bionic Dance!  Greetings fellow space travelers, Bionic Dance here.  I admit, I've been avoiding tackling a Caleb and Sophia video for a while now, and for a couple of reasons.  First, they've been pretty thoroughly covered by our friend Telltale, to whom you should all be subscribed.  I don't really like stepping on other people's toes, tackling the same videos they have already.  Maybe it's irrational on my part, but it always felt like a kind of courtesy.  Second, speaking as an animator, seeing the art used for... this, bugs me on a completely other level.  Anyway, buckle up, stow those tray tables, time for takeoff.  We've got the little girl, Sophia, looking at drawings of other people's families.  She sees the pic of the two mommies, and it makes her rather nervous. ",

Being alive is one of my very favoritest things.  Do you think homosexuals are gonna walk into paradise strapped with belly bombs?  i don't think so.  goodness knows that's not my plan course.  i don't think this heaven of yours even exists but if it did i'm no threat to anybody's safety.  and what kind of elitist prick is this jehovah of yours that we have to meet his standards to be allowed into the clubhouse?  Are we LGBT folk gonna harsh on his mellows?  so bad, really?  Speaking as an atheist, I think your book was written by men with severe homophobia.  I don't think every homophobe is secretly gay.  Goodness knows that I find dicks extremely creepy and I'm not secretly straight.  But gay sex definitely gave them the wiggins.  Based on what I've seen and heard, I think guys have this weird love-hate hang-up about penises.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like they want to be proud of their own, but are marginally ashamed of it, too, and creeped out by everybody else's.  I mean, they call their three-piece set their junk.  We all use dick as an insult, and yet having a large one is supposed to be a sign of studliness, of extreme masculinity.  Maybe it's just because I'm looking at this from the outside, but it's weird.  So when I see homophobia like this, I figure it's probably part of that pride-slash-shame combo.  Of course, I'll never understand anybody having a problem with lesbian sex, but then again, I'm hardly objective on that point, now am I? ",

            "text": "Let's unpack this a little.  The mom says that people can change, and Sophia wants to know what she can say to her friend.  What do they think is going to happen here?  No, seriously.  They're suggesting that this little girl should passive-aggressively try to get Carrie to think that her parents should break up and find husbands instead.  They're trying to destroy a loving family, they're recruiting a child to do it, and they're making it seem like it's all sunshine and rainbows.  how sick is that.  if i believed in evil this would probably be in my top ten at least.  and the worst evil comes not with a snarl but with a smile so you don't see it coming until it's too late.  Okay, a couple of things before I go.  First, I think I've figured out where their dad is from.  He's not in this video, but Caleb and Sophia's father has this really funky accent and no one can figure out where it's from.  Well, I at least might have a clue.  See, while looking for Caleb and Sophia's channel, I ran across another YouTube channel that has all of these videos, but they're translated into Portuguese sign language.  Not kidding.  Now, they obviously speak Portuguese in Portugal, but they also speak it in Brazil.  So he might be Brazilian.  Watching videos of people from Brazil speaking English, the accent is pretty similar.  And in a forum I saw where people were discussing this exact issue, someone else mentioned they have a Brazilian co-worker and they sound pretty similar to Caleb and Sophia's dad.  So I think he's Brazilian.  And one other thing before I go, I have a thank you.  This is a movie from the 90s called Zeram.  Most people say Zeram, but it's Zeram in Japanese.  And it's the basis for my favorite anime.  The live action came first.  My favorite anime is called Iria.  That's the main character there.  She's pretty badass.  And I haven't seen this movie in ages.  Now, what I didn't realize is there's a sequel.  And it's on this as well.  So, yeah, I can't wait to watch this.  It's been a really long time since I've seen anything but the anime.  So, cool.  There was no note.  No one said who sent this.  That's actually kind of frustrating because I like to be able to say thank you to the right person.  But still, whoever you are, thanks for this.  Right.  So, until next time, fellow space travelers, this is Bionic Dance saying don't run on automatic.  Instead, please think.  What else might Sia... Sia?  Sia.  Sophia.  The implication being that, actually, no, it doesn't matter what people... Of course, I'm being weapons-grade flippant right now, obviously, but you will notice that the Bible only ever condemns... So neither Adam nor Eve... Garden of Even?  Garden of Edith?  Yeah, whatever the fuck.  And the worst evil comes not with a smarl.  Smarl?  Smarl.  Yeah.  They're recruiting a child to do it, and they're making it seem like it's all sunshines and rainbows.  Sunshines.  Sunshine.  How many suns are there?  Kitty tail, I need you to sit and stop bumping the mic, please.  Thank you.  And Columbia slashed me really bad this morning.  I was lying in bed.  She was on my chest.  She decided to jump off and use my chin as a stepping stone on the way off.  Ow!  Not rating and subscribing has been found to cause obesity, acne, and male pattern baldness in laboratory rats. ",
