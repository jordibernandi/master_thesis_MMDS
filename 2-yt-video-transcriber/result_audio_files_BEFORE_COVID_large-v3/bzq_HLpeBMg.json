            "text": "Hello there.  As the hard left of UK Labour Party politics and the tattered remnants of the Remain campaign slowly wake up to the truth that the UK has rejected them both, the good news from the Brexit general election keeps coming in.  Now before I start, please help the YouTube algorithm give this video a big boost by hitting that like button.  So we've all reveled in the lefties and the remainers, all weeping in their collective beers as they see their misbegotten dreams flushed down the loo.  How many of us have all smiled at the glum face of the twat in the hat with the megaphone turned Lib Dem candidate Steve Bray once he found out what the voters truly thought after they gave him sixth place out of seven on just 949 votes?  the fool of the man they tried to call Mr Stop Brexit, the person who probably had more news airtime than any other single politician, pundit and even news broadcaster.  And guess what his plans are now?  Yep, you got it, he intends to keep fighting to stop Brexit.  He told Reuters, The fight carries on.  Absolutely.  I'm going to do everything I can, and I'm sure millions of other people will too.  Whilst we are still in the European Union, there is hope, albeit the odds are stacked against us.  Rome was not built in a day.  And I'm with the Prime Minister Boris Johnson on this one, when he said during his victory speech, I say respectfully to our stentorian friend in the blue 12-star hat, time to put a sock in the megaphone and give everybody some peace.  And wasn't the sad face of Owen Jones a real sight to behold?  But the real good news today is that there is another whole bunch of people we've forgotten to mention here.  Another whole boatload of politicians, many of whom will be more than sore and even sick as a pig at this result.  Yes, it's that phalanx of politicians we sent off after the EU elections in May to represent us within the hallowed halls of Brussels and Strasbourg.  Yes, those members of the European Parliament.  Remember them?  And how many of you can name any of them?  How many of us can say what those MEPs have actually achieved?  And how many of us now actually care?  How many of us can state with clarity the supposed added value they brought to our nation, other than the vague perception that they were over there and doing something in the EU in order to be inclusive and progressive, maybe?  And each one of them on a hefty wage, hefty expenses, with a free on-call luxury limousine service, an enclosed and exclusive shopping mall just for them, and an added 300-odd quid a day when they actually turned up in the EU Parliament to do their work, armed with their ready-inked rubber stamps in hand.  Yes, we have 72 of them, and thank goodness their tenure will be terminating on or before 31 January 2020, not a second too soon.  And that's all down to the good sense of the UK electorate to put in place a Prime Minister who promises to get Brexit done.  And apart from the reduced number of UK politicians, this also heralds the complete removal of that whole tier of EU politics and EU politicians ruling our lives.  It removes 72 people who rubber stamp EU commission-driven laws on how we live, work and play.  And it takes away any excuses that our MPs currently use for not following through on their election promises.  Gone are the days of, the EU won't let us do that, or the EU rules mean we have to do the other.  Well, actually, it might or might not do, over time, if the Boris Johnson Withdrawal Agreement Treaty is signed up to by our Parliament, as opposed to an immediate clean-break Brexit which would ensure our total independence at the stroke of a pen.  But we won't know exactly how that Boris treaty will pan out, not until we see how our MPs want to frame the baseline for the talks on the political declaration and future UK-EU relationship after we've actually left the EU in January next year.  And remember, we are locked into the EU by a new treaty arrangement for the duration of the transition phase.  We won't really have left the EU on Brexit day in real terms.  But back to those MEPs.  It could be tempting to just write them off as an expensive irrelevance that brings nothing tangible to our domestic table.  But that would be missing the whole point of them and of the EU Parliament.  Apart from those Eurosceptic MEPs from the likes of UKIP and the Brexit Party who went over to the EU Parliament to fight for UK sovereignty and independence, the rest of them were there for the exact opposite reason.  The whole point of the EU Parliament and MEPs is to legitimise the European Union in the eyes of the citizens of EU member states via a perception of democracy.  The job of MEPs is to help widen the scope of EU control over the people within the bloc.  They are there to help push the EU agenda.  They are not there to push national agendas.  No, their task is to drive the vision of the EU Parliament being the Parliament of the European Union, a Parliament serving the executive of the EU, that is the government of the EU, that the EU Commission has already arguably become.  If there was ever a Parliament against the people, it is the EU Parliament.  MEPs exist purely to give legitimacy at a national level to all those laws that tie nation-states just that bit further into the EU.  And all the perks and money that MEPs get are part of the structure of pulling them in.  MEPs are an important component of the ratchet of ever-closer European Union.  And most MEPs have been chosen over the years by the pro-EU parties like Labour, the Tories, the Greens, the Lib Dems, the SNP,  etc.,  because of their firm belief that that the EU system must replace our nation's democratic systems and, over time, they assist the EU in gaining supremacy at every level of our lives.  And then pro-EU MPs, lords and civil servants were selected for their good European credentials and stuffed into Westminster to ensure that the flow of EU law onto our statute books remained as far as possible unimpeded and often accelerated with the principle of gold plating.  And thus the EU project became almost unfettered by any thoughts of patriotism and nationalism.  except, of course, for the new strident pro-EU super-state.  nationalism and patriotism screamed out by those who proclaim the EU as their new country, and that anyone who disagree with them is a bigot.  But those that represent us in that noose of ever closer union have now been instructed by the UK electorate, that's us folks, to return to these shores.  those from the Brexit party will return victorious together with the ghosts of UKIPA MEPs past.  Those pro-EU MEPs who went over to the EU with the intention of dismantling the UK will return defeated and will have utterly failed in their task of smothering the UK in a blanket of EU rules and regulations designed to stamp out any vestige of national identity and individuality.  and they failed, despite having had the vast array of the UK establishment behind them for decades.  The UK is on its way to regaining its full national identity, while the EU27 will surrender theirs to being defined merely by labels on wines and cheeses.  So it's all over, is it?  Well as a matter of fact, no it isn't.  Because it all hinges now on what sort of post-exit day deal that Boris brings back from Brussels by the end of 2020.  And can he bring it back as promised on time?  Will Boris stick to the promise of leaving the transition phase by the 31st of December 2020, deal or no deal?  Will we be looking at a transition phase extension being declared by mid-2020 because it's all oh so difficult to agree a deal with the EU?  Also consider that we don't yet know who is going to be negotiating on our side, do we?  We don't know where the new UK Parliament will set the negotiating baselines yet, do we?  In fact, the only thing we do know is that the EU chief Brexit negotiator will continue to be Michel Barnier, the man that Nigel Farage famously said he'd prefer to have on our side.  Jean-Claude Juncker has, for example, been replaced by Ursula von der Leyen as the EU Commission President.  Donald Tusk has been replaced by Charles Michel as the President of the EU Council.  Now this is an important post where the future relationship aspects of the Brexit negotiations are concerned.  Charles Michel is now in the seat that acts as the glue between the EU 27 member states.  His role is to ensure a unified and unbroken response from all EU member states to UK demands and requests.  He will be working to prevent splits in the EU27 that might end up handing advantages to the UK.  Then there's Christine Lagarde, who took over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank.  And don't forget the new president of the EU Parliament, David Sassoli, who has now taken over from Antonio Tahani.  A lot of changes at the top in the EU, together with a whole new EU Parliament and a whole new EU Commission.  Now couple this with an invigorated UK Parliament with a fresh UK government elected on a clear mandate of delivering Brexit.  So I would say that the negotiations next year will have a whole new feel to them, compared to those that we have been forced to suffer over the previous three and a half years.  But different does not mean any less hard fought, and it also does not mean that our remain, soon to be rejoin, campaigners have lost any of their determination to see off Brexit in any way they can.  If you think that the likes of Blair, Major, Clegg, Grieve, Cameron, Gina Miller and all the other bitter remainers will just step back and accept the result, then you have another think coming to you.  They and their hyper-rich backers will not let up.  Their aim will now be to soften Brexit to the point of it being a Brexit in name only, then ready the UK for re-entry into the EU at the earliest available opportunity.  The battle for UK independence and sovereignty will be a perpetual battle against these types of people.  And we've already been given a flavour of how that could develop as evidenced by the rather ugly street protests we've seen from some of those vile anti-Brexit protesters who try to pretend they are against fascism while they practice it with an almost undisguised relish.  So get ready for it.  Anyway, what do you think?  Please share and comment and thank you for watching. ",
