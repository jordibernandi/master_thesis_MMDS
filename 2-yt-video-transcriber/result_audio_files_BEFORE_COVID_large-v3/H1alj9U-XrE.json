I respect everyone that we talk to.  I'm a straight shooter.  I'm studying one of your zones, okay?  So if you come at me and you flex, what am I gonna do?  Flex.  If you come at me yelling, what am I gonna do?  Yell.  That's all about respect and self-behavior.  If you show me a behavior and it's disrespectful, knowing that you have a daughter that will not tolerate that, that's disrespectful.  None of the other cops pulled up with their lights on.  He parked normal.  When he saw me start recording, he ran in.  This guy came in the wrong way, down a one-way, exit only, parked all messed up, no lights.  And then his lights came in almost causing an accident.  They're talking about me right now.  And I gave him my number because I work for the city.  I believe in y'all.  That's me in the Boston meeting.  So I work for the city of Boston.  And I know this is just your night.  We'll take you home.  Okay?  Because he has so many beliefs.  I don't know.  Can I get your name and badge number, sir?  Listen, we're doing something.  Can I get your name and badge number?  You just took a picture of me.  I'm going to FOIA request that.  Can I get your name and badge number?  No, you can back off.  We're doing something.  All right.  I'll get your name and badge number after.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm a cop watching.  Don't worry.  Of course, he can break away to take my picture, but he can't ask me a question.  He can't answer my question.  He took a break to walk to his car, get his phone, and take my picture, but he can't answer my question of who he is.  Everything is fine.  Oh, yeah, it's fine.  It's not for you.  I follow the police.  I record them, make sure they don't violate anyone's civil rights.  Yeah, you're welcome.  Thank you.  Sir, can I get your name and badge number?  Excuse me, sir.  Excuse me, sir.  Excuse me, sir.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Can you put your window down?  Thanks, Saj.  Appreciate it.  Real professional.  I was talking to him.  No, no, I was talking to him.  I was talking to him.  Alright, thank you.  This is for everybody.  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm not out here trying to break walls.  Did you say my name?  Did you say my name?  I don't think you have, sir.  Oh, you did?  Oh, good memory, but I didn't tell you my name, though.  That's weird.  No, I didn't.  He was busy.  Just gonna ask this guy real quick.  His name.  How you doing, sir?  I met you at the movie?  Yeah, I saw you that day.  Nice to meet you again.  What was your name again, sir?  Officer Claudino.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, I don't really recognize you with all the stuff on.  You had the yellow thing on before.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you know that sergeant's name?  He can give it to you if he likes.  All right.  I understand.  Appreciate it, buddy.  I get it.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  You too.  Appreciate your professionalism, sir.  You too.  So this police officer right here just had another stop.  He's a sergeant.  He took a picture of me.  He didn't want to identify.  He had a little toot.  Honestly, I'm a little nervous about this one.  Got it all around here.  There he goes.  It's that easy, guys.  It's that easy.  You can see his stripes on his shirt.  So that sergeant is right there.  He's about to turn left.  I think he might do a loop around.  It's these road cops, these outlaw cops, that you gotta be worried about.  Excuse me, sir.  Excuse me.  Excuse me sir, can you put your window down?  I have a question.  That's Salem PD for you guys, Salem PD. ",
