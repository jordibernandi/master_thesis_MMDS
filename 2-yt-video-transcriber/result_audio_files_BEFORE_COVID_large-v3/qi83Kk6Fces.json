            "text": "You're such an asshole.  Asshole Consulting, how are you guys doing?  We're in Tuxon, Tuxon, Arizona.  Aaron, isn't it called Tucson?  Yes, it is, and you just didn't get the joke.  It's raining, and it's miserable, and old Cappy decided to take a day off and do absolutely jack shit.  And he's like, ah, ah, ah.  Better do some fucking production of GDP because then I don't feel like I'm doing anything.  Hey, asshole.  I would like a video on the following.  My question for you is what are your thoughts on the possibility of a second civil war or the like of a Roman Republic becoming an imperial state as politics spirals into bad comedy?  In your mind, do we line up like the blue and gray or do you predict... Different lines closer to an insurgent game.  You have seen the USSR collapse in our lifetime, so large states can and will fail.  Please give us a rundown on the decline gone bad.  Please don't jump right out to Fallout 3 unless you play G&R in the background.  Oh, Guns N' Roses?  Yeah, I was never... The inferior people.  I do mean that.  The inferior people listen to Guns N' Roses.  They wore the Iron Maiden shirts and the Guns N' Roses.  The same people who wore Guns N' Roses shirts also wore Vanilla Ice.  Vanilla Ice.  And who are the two gay black guys that faked it?  Not Flava Flav.  Milli-vanilli.  That's what it was.  Yeah, don't worry.  Not going to happen here.  All right.  There is zero chance of a civil war.  And here's why there will be zero chance of a civil war.  Because the left will win because they have demographics and they have the education system on their side.  Thankfully, I'll be dead by that time.  I really won't care.  It'll actually be hilarious.  I wish I still had sentience and consciousness after I died to see the United States collapse into the other shithole that it deserves.  But there will be no civil war.  And the reason why is that?  the powers that be, there are a few smart Democrat, leftist, socialist, parasite type of people You know, all they got to do is wait until white people stop breeding.  And even then, I've said it before, I'll say it again.  White people not breeding is half the formula.  Two-thirds the formula, and the math won't add up, so please don't audit me.  You have demographic changes within the United States, so there will be Hispanic and Latino and immigration and even the Asians.  The Asians voted for Obama last time.  Um, that demographic shift will make us very much like a Mexico where it's like, we're voting for the PRI because they promised no shit. ",

            "text": "So that's, uh, one major influence.  But the other major influences, let us not just think this is about our black and Latino and brown or whatever other color brothers and sisters.  The white people, the dipshits, the millennials prove that.  I'm thinking it's going to be the same thing with Gen Z. Spoiled little prissy.  white kids from the suburbs are going to vote leftist shit in left and right.  So there will be a socialist order and we will slowly become like Brazil or Mexico.  Mexico had the PRI for many years. ",

            "text": "But getting back to your question, so there's not going to be a civil war.  No, no.  White people are too pussy-ish.  Republicans are too conservative.  Um, nobody in life is too good.  And that's the, that's the interesting wild card here.  The wild card that's thrown in is one of that of technology where we have it really great.  Everything's wonderful.  Nobody has a reason to go and kick ass and revolt or anything like that.  And the United States also has the world's reserve currency, which I cannot emphasize enough.  where the rest of the world is so corrupt that we could print off, we could triple our monetary supply and people would still buy U.S.  dollars because we're the United States.  So bad comedy, USR.  No.  So there won't be a civil war.  There won't.  Because, one, demographically, the people that would fight against the ensuing leftist socialist, non-Western European type of people that are immigrants, they'll just outbreed.  White people won't breed.  I can't blame them much either.  I don't want to fuck a white chick.  I don't know.  And then there's also the, I mean, everything's going against, you know, civil, you're all, there's a singularity, there's a leftist singularity occurring that cannot be stopped.  It won't be stopped.  The United States will just become another Brazil.  I want to say Mexico.  Mexico, there's at least a little bit of independence there.  But yeah, we'll just become another Mexico.  We'll just become another second-rate, second-world country.  We won't land any more people on the moon.  We won't solve any more cancers or plagues or diseases.  Because diversity is so important.  Diversity is more important.  Diversity, Uber, Alice.  Yes, that's what I mean.  No, that's it.  There you go.  All right.  SLConsulting.com.  See you guys later.  Toodles.  Thank you. ",
