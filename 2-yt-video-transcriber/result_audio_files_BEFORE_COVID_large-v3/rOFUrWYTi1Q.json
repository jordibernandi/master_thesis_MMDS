I have 265,000 followers on Twitter before I was banned.  And I just talked to Don Jr.  the other day.  Don Jr.  follows me on Instagram.  Kimberly Guilfoyle follows me on Instagram.  I just had dinner with Katrina Pearson last night, who's the senior advisor to President Trump, and they are now banning me from CPAC.  They're taking away my media credentials.  Any reason why they're taking away my media credentials?  Can you just provide a reason?  I've already explained that to you, ma'am.  Apparently, somebody from CPAC doesn't want me attending, so... You see, Laura Loomer, Illuminate Media, CPAC 2019, media credentials.  I'm banned on Twitter, banned on Uber, banned on PayPal, banned on Uber Eats, Lyft, GoFundMe, everywhere, and now they're banning me from CPAC, so... I mean, I'm one of President Trump's biggest supporters.  The politics are irrelevant?  It doesn't make any sense.  I just had dinner with his senior advisor last night, Katrina Pearson.  Why would they ban me from CPAC?  This is such bad optics. ",

But what about all these left-wing agitators?  They're allowed in.  That's who got you banned.  Put your camera back on.  This is ridiculous.  They just banned me.  They said I can't come in.  This is ridiculous.  I just had dinner with Trump's advisors last night.  And they're trying to ban me from CPAC.  You've got to be kidding me.  Omar, they literally just banned me from CPAC.  They just banned me from CPAC.  I was like, you're the biggest supporter of Trump.  I don't understand.  I'm one of Trump's biggest supporters.  This is such bad optics for CPAC.  Did they give you any reason?  No.  They didn't give me a reason.  And I guess, are you rolling?  This is ridiculous. ",
