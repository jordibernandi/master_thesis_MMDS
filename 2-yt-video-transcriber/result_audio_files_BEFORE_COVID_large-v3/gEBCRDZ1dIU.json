These are my rings here.  14-foot high ceilings.  The rings are down because of doing lateral armed push-ups.  Trying to build my chest back up.  I had a radical mastectomy and lost a bunch of muscle mass there.  Big tree next door, next to the window here.  Everything's dirty because we're still in the remodel process.  Supposed to have people in here and do painting and stuff, but I'm pissed that there's no electricity.  Got the attitude.  Jerk me around, that's it.  You can try and waste my money, but I'm not going to let you try and waste my time.  So anyway, 600 square feet, maybe a little bit more.  This is the bathroom and a shower and hot water tank further back.  Shower is mostly for doing dog baths.  A little room for the freezer and the refrigerator.

So I can do a live stream and... do recordings and make videos, and we're going to try and put in a 3D printer at some stage here.  But it's a nice place.  And a lot of work yet.  A lot more work I just made myself by firing the electrician, but if he's going to take five weeks to do it, sending me a guy for two. ",
