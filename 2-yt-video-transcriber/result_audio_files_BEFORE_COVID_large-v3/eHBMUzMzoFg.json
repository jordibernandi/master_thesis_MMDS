And together we're going to be conducting a First Amendment audit of the Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall.  Going to make sure that our friends at the Jehovah's Witness Church, or whatever it is, respect and honor our constitutional right to record in public.  We've already gotten their attention.  He's out here taking notes and pointing his finger and just getting our description saying, oh, we've got this guy over here, he's all dressed in black, wearing BDU style pants, blouse with the boots.  Well, that was quick.  Oh, they're pointing, pointing the fingers.  He keeps pulling out his little notebook thingy, and... Oh, they ain't digging it too much.  They're trying to figure out what to do.  Oh, we haven't even crossed the street yet, and they're already on us.  Come back.  All right, I'm going to have to go over there and say hi to them.  I'll go over there and introduce myself before they sic the Jehovah's Witness mafia on me.  So this is it.  This is the building.  This is Kingdom Hall.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm good, thank you.
