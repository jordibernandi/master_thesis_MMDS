            "text": "Shalom, everyone, this is Amir Tsarfati, and I'm on a special update from Galilee, from my home.  And this is a historic day, very, very important to Israel, and I believe to every Bible prophecy lover.  So I'll wait a few seconds, and I want to, of course, address the historic, acknowledgement of the Golan Heights as the Israeli territory that President Trump just gave a few minutes ago, ahead of the visit of Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday to the White House.  Ladies and gentlemen, I know that everybody was super excited about Jerusalem.  Everybody's super excited about recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  Let me tell you something, recognizing the Golan Heights as an Israeli territory is the thing that I believe will accelerate the advance of the northern, may I say, front into a confrontation.  You need to understand that As far as the Syrians are concerned, this is Syrian territory.  Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981.  Menachem Begin was the prime minister.  But historically, this is part of the tribe of Menashe.  And historically, even in modern days, this was part of the Palestine that the British Mandate was supposed to prepare as a homeland for the Jewish people.  It was a deal between the French and British for swapping some territories.  And then the French received it and then they gave it to Syria, part of the independent Syria that they created.  But originally, It was a territory that was promised as a homeland for the Jewish people, part of the original Balfour Declaration.  And historically, this place is part of the tribes of Israel.  And you do not find in that place any Arab people.  archaeological findings of biblical times, of course.  You can find there 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th century synagogues.  You can find there even earlier periods of Jewish presence there.  One thing for sure, Arab, Syrian, you can find there, not until much later.  So historically, politically, and even from the international law, it is part of Israel.  And President Trump, just like he did with Jerusalem, he acknowledged the obvious.  With Jerusalem, it's obvious, it's the capital of Israel, he acknowledged that last year.  And this year, he acknowledged, Ladies and gentlemen, this is a historic day.  Prime Minister Netanyahu just congratulated Donald Trump for his very brave decision, hopefully will continue and taken by other nations as well.  Remember who is now controlling Syria?  It's Russia.  Remember what is it that we have in the Golan oil and gas?  Remember what is it that Syria wants in its presence?  It's the spoils of war.  Ladies and gentlemen, this decision, if you ask me, is one gigantic step towards Russian aggression that will come against Israel because obviously Vladimir Putin will not like this decision.  It takes a chunk of what he may have hoped to get in the future if he stays there.  We've heard enough rumors from the Russians that once the civil war in Syria will come to an end, They will demand the Golan Heights back to Syria.  So this is amazing.  This is a historical day.  This is an unprecedented thing, a U.S.  president against the stand of Europe and the stand of the rest of the nations of the world.  is recognizing Israel's sovereignty on the Golan Heights.  And the meaning is that from now on, when America will help Israel or when America will refer to Israel, the Golan will be part of it.  In the official maps of Israel, the Americans will have to add the Golan Heights.  And in every other discussion over the future of Israel and the security of Israel, the Golan Heights will be considered an Israeli territory.  Even for future negotiations, we literally today removed from the table even the option of returning the Golan to Syrian hands.  This is an amazing day.  This is a historic day.  It is our ancestral homeland.  It is a place where Jews live.  It is a place where the children of Israel dwell.  It is a place mentioned in the Bible.  By the way, some of you may not know that, but Golan was the name of one of the refuge cities in the territory called Bashan.  If in the Old Testament the territory was called Bashan, in modern days it's called Golan.  But the name Golan appears in the Old Testament as the name of one of the cities of refuge.  If you accidentally kill someone, if you accidentally committed some sort of crime, You could run to that city of refuge because obviously there was no intention to do that.  And you could live there.  Every tribe had those type of cities at the time.  And the tribe of the other half, the half of Menashe, had Golan as one of its refuge cities.  And of course, throughout the course of the years, the name Golan now becomes the name of the entire region.  So ladies and gentlemen, an amazing, amazing, amazing day today.  I'm going to find it hard to fall asleep.  I believe that we just maybe we are waking up the Russian giant, the Russian bear right now from its deep sleep in Syria.  Right now Russia is super passive in Syria.  Russia is trying to be the policeman there.  But it could be that we, in light of this decision, we may have lost the alliance that we had with Russia, and they might become more aggressive towards us.  Definitely, they do not agree with that, just like they've never agreed with Jerusalem.  being the capital with that unilateral decision.  But remember, Jerusalem, whether it's the capital of Israel or not, it's not affecting Russia at all.  But when Russia is right on the border of the Golan and Russia is. ",
