            "text": "Thank you.  Sorry?  Sorry?  I can't hear you.  Can I help you with anything?  I'm sorry, I'm listening to headphones.  Can I help you with anything?  Nah, not really.  I'm just going to have to ignore you.  I'm sorry, I'm listening to headphones.  Last night we had a couple fires here.  Now you're showing up.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you talking to me?  Yeah, I said last night we had a couple fires here.  Now you're showing up.  A couple fires here.  Oh, yeah, we had personal fires here last night.  Now you're here.  Oh, that's weird.  Yeah, because guys with cameras cause fires.  You should go for detective for the police.  You might be really good.  Sorry, I can't hear you anymore.  You're shaking there.  Are you okay, buddy?  Do you need mental help or some kind of... Are you having an amnibalism or whatever?  Are you going to drop your coffee?  You look really unstable right now.  Do you need medical help?  Okay.  Okay.  Maybe you shouldn't walk up to strangers and fuck with them if you can't stand straight.  It's a little weird.  I shouldn't walk up to you and fuck with them?  Is that what you said?  Yeah.  I'm just asking what you're doing here, taking pictures of our building.  Yeah, I'm on the public sidewalk.  I have no reason to talk to you.  You absolutely are, yeah.  I have no reason to really talk to you at all.  No, you don't.  No, I'm just talking.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Your cup's shaking a lot.  Your phone's shaking a lot.  Yeah, I'm pumped right now.  Why?  Why?  Because you're taking pictures of our building.  Why should that pump you up?  Because we don't know what's going on.  Like you said, we had fires here last night.  Why would you assume a guy with a camera is something bad?  Who knows?  Because it was our gate operators that were potentially on fire last night.  Why would you assume a guy with a camera?  Because you're right next to where the fires occurred last night.  So you're saying that somebody caused a fire and then came back to the same spot in broad daylight with a camera to take pictures of him?  That's crazy.  That'd be the stupidest criminal in the world.  You must watch a lot of Bruce Willis movies.  You must think that's real life.  I don't know who Bruce Willis is.  I'd show your age right now.  What a liar.  You don't know Die Hard, the movie?  Well, I know who he is.  Yeah, you're a liar.  I'd have to watch the movie.  So you know who Bruce Willis is?  Of course I know who Bruce Willis is.  I wouldn't watch any of his movies.  Well, you can't know who he is and not have watched any of his movies.  Of course you wouldn't.  Or else you wouldn't know who he is.  It's an A-B logic thing.  So you obviously think those movies are real.  And you're like the self-appointed company police.  And oh no, there's somebody on the sidewalk with a camera.  I have to go get pumped and check it out.  I mean, seriously, that's... The next day, I didn't know there was a fire here.  Where's the evidence of a fire?  Let's see.  I think you're full of shit.  I don't see anything charred, anything burned.  No, where's the fire, dude?  Here's timestamp today, 3.11 a.m What is that?  That looks like these gates right here, doesn't it?  I don't, it's a black, it's a dark picture.  I don't know.  I don't know what that is.  I don't see any signs of fire here.  For all I know, that could be your basement where you keep captives or something.  I don't know.  Good luck being pumped, dude.  Have a pumped day.  Get pumped in the bathroom.  Lay off the caffeine while you're at it.  You might live longer.  Go pump yourself, dude.  What a tool.  What a fucking jackass tool.  Hey guys, I'm not lying.  I am listening to headphones.  Sorry I may not be narrating very much, because I'm listening to some good tunes.  But there's some signs of fire in the ground there.  And anyway, that's just the first place that I came up to.  Talk about jumping to conclusions.  Who the fuck would set my fire near a metal gate?  They were trying to gain entry.  It's a metal gate.  It's not going to burn from a simple bushfire.  What kind of idiot?  Fucking Bruce Willis, dude.  That fucker. ",
