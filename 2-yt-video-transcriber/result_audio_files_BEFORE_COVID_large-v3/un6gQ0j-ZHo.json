            "text": "I don't like feeling like I'm being used as a thing to spark a marriage up.  That's not really me personally.  Hey guys, it's Kat and it's time for another episode of True Tea.  I want to thank you guys so much for joining me for this video.  I am really appreciating all of the fun conversations we have been having on my channel about polyamory, even though I really want to reinforce that there are more things to my life than dating.  I have more things to talk about.  It's just one of those things where like, there are so many things to talk about that I can't stop.  So I want to thank you guys for being patient and really participating with me in this.  If you are new to my channel, we mostly for now do videos like this.  I will occasionally be doing videos like my video essay that I did about the rebranding of white nationalism, because we are a multifaceted type of person.  We have a lot of conversations here that are varied and different.  And this channel is all about learning, sharing, and growing together.  So that's what we're doing.  And this is the share portion.  And this is kind of the portion where I tend to overshare.  So, you know.  Hopefully you guys enjoy it.  Um, anyway, um, I'm going to be talking about something that I'm pretty passionate about.  So, um, I would suggest that you go to your kitchen and get yourself some tea.  I am drinking some Jade citrus tea, um, out of my SDSU cup that I got from the woman's resource center.  Um, when I went out there and I just want to thank everyone who's ever invited me to a college or university.  Um, I really love speaking at colleges and speaking to students.  So if you're ever interested, and having me come to your school, you can always check out the description box below.  So I wanted to talk to you guys about polyamory versus open relationships and why I tend to avoid people who are in open relationships, right?  Um, and I will start out by saying that everyone's got their own definition of these things.  You know, one of the things you learn pretty quickly in the poly world is that everyone's figuring their, their thing out.  Um, and different people have different understandings of both of these things.  You know what?  mean something to one person can mean another thing to another.  So, you know, I've got my own sort of thing.  Um, and that is what it is, but I'm open to being wrong as I usually am.  So if you're somebody who is in an open relationship and you've got something to say, you want me feel free to leave a comment in the comment box below.  I always welcome your brew of fresh, freshly brewed true tea.  So, You know, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong or if you think I'm wrong.  I mean, I'm not.  I'm not.  But we can talk about it if you really want to.  Anyway, so open relationships, polyamory.  To me, these are very different things.  One of my biggest pet peeves, honestly, is that I think that there are a lot of people calling themselves polyamorous who are not polyamorous.  Um, and I, I'm always very hesitant to be a gatekeeper because I don't want to be that.  I don't want to be a person who says you have to feel this way or that way in order to be this thing.  But personally for me, um, one of the biggest, issues is there are people that do this thing.  I think I've heard, I forget the term.  It's like ambiarists or something.  There are people who are polyamorous and are monogamous in different situations.  Now, we've talked in the past about how I kind of feel like a lot of the thing that a lot of people in the poly community do.  is they?  It's like a lot of woo and a lot of like words that are, maybe you'll feel nice, but aren't real realistic or the application isn't real.  I know.  And again, feel free to drag me if I'm wrong, but I do not believe that you are polyamorous when you're open to monogamy.  I don't.  For me, monogamy is a trap.  It doesn't feel safe.  It doesn't feel warm.  It doesn't feel welcoming.  It doesn't feel flattering.  It feels like a threat.  And that's why I'm polyamorous.  And again, I don't want to do the gatekeeping thing of telling people who they are and what is and what isn't.  But it's hard.  It's been very frustrating for me to meet people who say they're polyamorous, date them for a period of time, and then have them, you know, get lassoed, as we call it in the poly community, by someone who's monogamous, right?  I think you can be monogamous.  I think that's fine.  I think monogamy is beautiful if that's what you want to do.  But as someone who does not find monogamy, to be romantic, flattering, or something that I desire, it's very frustrating dating people who say that they're polyamorous when they're actually not.  Everyone, I think, for the most part, goes through a process of dating a bunch of people before they find a person that they really, really, really, really, really, really, really like, right?  I don't think that that should be compared to polyamory because that's not really what we're doing.  people who are polyamorous believe that they can have significant relationships with more than one person.  That's not, you can have more than one person.  That's not, you can, you know, you'd be naughty and happy.  You can actually be in love polyamorous with more than one person.  Right.  But, you know, I think everyone can self-define, you know, don't, I mean, if you've, if, Don't let me tell you how to feel about yourself.  I have my position because for me, I think a lot of people like to do that weird, oh, I'm poly, but they just mean that they're dating around.  It's very different to me.  It's very, very different.  Most of us, date, sleep with, et cetera, more than one person at a time while we're trying to find a person that we really, really enjoy spending time with.  That's very normal, that's very common.  I don't think calling that polyamory is productive, especially with people who are actually polyamorous.  But at the same time, people are figuring themselves out.  And that's another thing about this conversation.  Oh, we're getting so off.  We're getting so derailed.  The thing about it is that you are, you are allowed to change your mind.  You are allowed to change it.  Like you can, you can change your mind.  It's just, for me, it's frustrating that people haven't done a real sort of soul search about how they feel about monogamy.  Because when I hear people say, oh, I'm, you know, I'm open to monogamy in certain situations.  I hear, okay, well, you're monogamous.  That's what I hear.  I hear, okay, you're not, and that's fine.  If you like it, I love it.  Be yourself, you know, love yourself, you know?  Um, but that's what I hear.  And so dealing with people who are in open relationships is frustrating to me.  Now, I understand that for some people, when you hear polyamory, and you hear open relationship, that sounds like the same thing.  It sounds like I'm talking about the same exact thing, right?  Now, I'll give you an example of myself.  I am solo poly at the moment, and so I'll just tell you what my situation is, right?  So I, as a solo poly amorist, I guess you could say, I have two partners.  Both of these are people who I care for very much, who I have a lot of emotional connection to.  They both know about each other and neither of them take precedent over the other.  In addition to those two people I'm dating, I'm also dating several other people who who are, you know, people I'm figuring out, some people that I haven't slept with, some people that I do sleep with, but they're not quite at that point that I would call them partners because they're not necessarily central portions, not necessarily central parts of my life, right?  That's my polyamory.  I believe that I can have those relationships And these can all be significant and important relationships to me.  And that's my polyamory.  Now, there's different types of polyamory.  Like I said, I'm solo poly, so I don't have, you know, I'm kind of doing my own thing.  I'm not really living with anyone.  I'm not nesting with anyone.  I don't have a primary.  That's my sort of thing.  But there's different types of polyamory, right?  Somebody who is in an open relationship, generally speaking, is somebody who is in a relationship that they want to protect.  And generally speaking, most of the time they are not open to having more than one true relationship, right?  So for example, I shouldn't probably tell people this, but, um, when I was at VidCon, right, I met these two different men, VidCon last year, these two different men who were in open relationships.  These men were both married, um, and they, had kids and things.  Um, but when they were out at VidCon, you know, having a good time socializing and things like that, their wives, um, gave them the permission to, if they were to meet somebody and that somebody wanted to have a good old time with them, that they can have that good old time.  Basically what I'm saying is people in open relationships generally have this relationship that they're protecting and they're leaving an openness for their partners to generally have other sexual connections, right?  Usually once that becomes more of a significant relationship type connection, that's when issues start.  Right.  And that's where I believe the polyamory thing doesn't really end up working out.  Right.  So for me personally.  I don't like to deal with people who are in open relationships who tend to often intersect and participate in poly spaces.  It's very, very common for people who are in open relationships to also want to be part of the poly community.  Sometimes people who are in open relationships become polyamorous because they maybe meet people who are significant to them enough that they want to date.  I mean, often people who are in open relationships, meet a person that they feel like they can date together.  And then that becomes like a close triad sort of thing.  Like all of that happens.  And like I said, people can change their mind.  But for me, For me, I tend to avoid everyone who is open to monogamy.  Everyone, you know, I mean, if I know you're open to monogamy, I'm saying that I dead ass have a date tonight with a guy who's open to monogamy.  But if you're open to monogamy, I know that our relationship isn't going to last because I'm not going to be monogamous with you.  You know, I'm not, I don't want to be monogamous with you.  Right.  And that doesn't mean that I don't like you or that I don't respect you, that I don't, enjoy your company or anything like that.  It's just, I'm not, that's not who I am.  You know, I'm not a monogamous person.  That doesn't mean I'm a cheater.  That doesn't mean that I go behind people's backs.  It means that I enjoy having more than one person in my life, but I don't believe that one person can be everything for me.  Usually with people who are in open relationships, they're generally sometimes trying to find something else in addition to what they have.  They're not trying to, um, you know, have these new relationships, have these new connections.  They're trying to have someone be an addition to, or a fun little moment for them at that time.  And I'm not super down for that.  You know, um, I don't want the relation.  I mean, obviously compersion is part of it.  Compersion is usually when you feel comfortable.  instead of jealousy, you feel like excitement that your partner is out there and, you know, having a good old time.  You know, that's great.  I think that's awesome.  You know, but I've always kind of had, I mean, obviously I want their partners to be happy that they're doing things with me, but I have a bit of discomfort with people who are pursuing a relationship with me because of how it enhances their relationship with their partner.  I don't like feeling like I'm being used as like a thing to, you know, spark a marriage up.  That's not really me personally.  Um, so yeah, that's why I tend to avoid people who are in open relationships.  I don't think that there's anything against that.  I have nothing against people who are in open relationships.  I just don't date them or really deal with them.  I mean, and if I do deal with them, it's in a very shallow space.  Like the one thing I've recognized for me about sex is that You know, I can have sex with somebody who is not particularly somebody who I want to date if it's like on my terms.  Like if I'm going somewhere and I'm deciding this is what I want to do and da-da-da-da-da and I think it's just that, I can do it.  But I generally speaking tend to really require a deeper, more significant relationship.  connection for me to enjoy sex.  I mean, of course I can have sex without that, but that's really important to me.  Sex is incredibly mental for me.  So I don't like to usually have sex without having that like intense connection.  Um, so yeah, that's why I, um, don't really deal with people who are in open relationships.  I think this is the shortest true tea video I have literally ever done.  But anyway, I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.  If you're in an open relationship, how is it working for you?  I'm curious for those of you guys who are in open relationships, why you aren't open to polyamory?  Why are you not open to your partner also having an actual significant relationship with another person?  And if you're poly, I also want to know how you feel about dating people who are monogamous.  I don't want to be a gatekeeper, but Whenever I, if I start dating somebody who's open to dating people who are open, who are open to monogamy, I know that's not going to work out.  I just know.  And historically that has proven to be true, you know?  And so I don't want to, um, I don't want to do that.  So anyway, I would love to know what you guys have to say.  So please feel free to leave your true tea in the comment box below.  I will be pinning my favorite comment.  that makes me think the most.  So please leave a good old meaty, thoughtful comment.  I love reading through them.  And right now you guys can see two fun little videos that are up right now that you can click on.  They're true tea videos about similar subjects.
