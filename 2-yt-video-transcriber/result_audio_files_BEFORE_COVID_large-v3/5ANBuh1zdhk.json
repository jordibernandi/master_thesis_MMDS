            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  I'm getting ready for my St.  Faustina retreat, which will be Saturday, October 5th at St.  Mary's Parish in Ottawa, starting at 9  a.m.,  finishing at 1 p.m It's free.  You don't have to register.  Just show up.  Opening scripture for you, Peter tells us.  in 1 Peter 5, he says, Be sober and vigilant.  Your opponent, the devil, is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.  Resist him steadfast in your faith.  Now, Saint Faustina, she's had a number of experiences where she saw people dying, and she saw the demons trying to drag the person to hell.  One example is... Paragraph 1565, the Lord asked her to pray for a person who's dying, the chaplet.  She says, when I began to say the chaplet, I saw the man dying in the midst of terrible torment and struggle.  His guardian angel was defending him.  But he was, as it were, powerless against the enormity of the soul's misery.  A multitude of devils was waiting for that soul.  But while I was saying the chaplet, I saw Jesus just as he is depicted in the image.  The rays which issued from Jesus' heart enveloped the sick man, and the powers of darkness fled in panic.  The sick man peacefully breathed his last.  When I came to myself, I understood how very important the chaplet was for the dying.  Now, this whole thing about when we're dying, the demons are trying to drag us into hell, it's real.  And it's in our tradition.  For example, there's a mystic.  There's a mystic who's also a canonized saint.  Saint Catherine of Siena, who... Just give me one minute here.  Father Thomas Dub\u00e9 says, is surely one of our race's most glorious women.  St.  Catherine of Siena, a saint, one of our race's most glorious women, but also a doctor of the church.  What does that mean?  That means that... when the church is asked about what she teaches on a certain doctrinal matter, the church points to the doctors of the church and say, listen to what they taught.  That represents the church teaching.  Now, St.  Catherine of Siena received revelations from God the Father.  They're called the Dialogue of the Seraphic virgin Catherine of Siena.  And in one of her dialogues, messages from God the Father, God the Father describes this reality of a dying soul being tormented and the devil's trying to drag him into hell.  Now, check this out.  The caption for this one is called, \"'Of the death of sinners and of their pains in the hour of  death.'\".  God the Father says, How terrible and dark is their death!  Because in the torment of death, as I told you, the devil accuses them with great terror and darkness, showing his face, which you know is so horrible that the creature would rather choose any pain that can be suffered in this world than to see it.  And so greatly does he freshen the sting of conscience that it gnaws him horribly.  The disordinate delights and sensuality of which he made lords over his reason accuse him miserably.  It goes on to say, The devil torments him in order to bring him to despair.  Oh, how hard for them is this battle.  It goes on, There remains mercy.  And with this mercy he can, if he will, take hold of hope.  It goes on, My mercy is greater without any comparison than all the sins which any creature can commit.  Wherefore, it greatly displeases me that they should consider their sins to be greater.  Despair is that sin which is pardoned neither here nor hereafter.  And it is because despair displeases me so much that I wish them to hope in my mercy at the point of death, even if their life.  Now listen, God the Father also says you need to get in the habit of relying on God's mercy, of hoping in his mercy.  Throughout life, we tend to feel bad about ourselves, despair, lose hope, and God is saying, Get used to hoping, not in your own works, not in your own accomplishments, not in your own strength, but hoping in the mercy of God and in the blood of Jesus.  St.  Catherine of Siena speaks constantly about the blood of Jesus.  And also pray the rosary.  In the rosary we pray to Our Lady.  We say pray for us sinners now.  and at the hour of our death.  Amen.  Brothers and sisters, know the dignity of your soul.  Why are the devils so anxious to have you?  Because your dignity is inexpressible.  Your dignity is so great.  The price of your soul is so great that Jesus paid for your soul with his most precious blood.  Viva Cristo. ",
