Oh, look at that.  Man, a lot of them aren't even married.  If you're a virgin, or you're ugly as fuck, and you're below a five on the scale of one to 10, and you ain't rich or got good game, you cannot be MGTOW, man.  You need to get out there to the venues and pick up some women first.  And I mean I can.  I can get any girl I want.  I don't give a shit about that You're not true MGTOW.  You're just a you know, ugly dude.  Can't get chicks nor want to try. ",

Oh, and I just happened to get out of the gym and I was working out and really pumped up and and oh I was just in there oiling my packs and yeah, and basically You guys, unless you're like a 10 or 11, and if you're like a four or something, you can't be a MGTO.  And I know that I have the authority to tell you what to do.  And who can be a MGTO and who can't?  And I've just got to go back to my apartment and oil up my pecs some more because I can get any chick I want.  And because of that, I can tell you that you can be a MGTO and that you're better looking than me. ",
