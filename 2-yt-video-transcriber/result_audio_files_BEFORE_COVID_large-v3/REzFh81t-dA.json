I'm just giving you, so the book brings this depth into saying, if I accepted this, now I renounce it because that's not what God has for me.  God doesn't have that plan for me.  So today, whatever tormented me, whatever, whether it's sickness, there's people that are sick, people got cancer and the devil's lining is putting a tormenting fear.  You're gonna die.  You're not gonna be here next year.  And, oh, you have diabetes and, oh, your high blood pressure's high.  You're never gonna get healed.  You're never gonna get well, right?  And your mind is being plagued by these things and going on.  And you have to say, no, you have to draw the line and say, I make a choice.  I will not submit to fear.  I will submit to God, Jesus Christ.  And once you do that, you renounce fear.  You renounce whatever is tormenting, whatever door you open, whatever portal you open, I renounce it.  Today, I divorce it.  I give it an eviction notice.  And I receive God's best in my life.  And filled with the Holy Spirit, move forward.  And you can be, wow, more than a conqueror. ",
