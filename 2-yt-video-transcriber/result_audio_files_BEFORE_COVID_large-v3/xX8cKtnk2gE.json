It's called Undesigned Coincidences, and that's to kind of explain that.  That's when... you know, when an account of one event omits pieces or a piece of information which are incidentally filled in by another account.  So it's kind of like when the police separate the eyewitnesses and they say, hey, what happened?  And this guy says, well, you know, the fight happened at a coffee shop, you know, down on North Main and it was crowded.  And then the other guy says, well, it happened down on North Main and And right before the fight happened, the guy knocked coffee on the other guy.  So those would be two separate accounts that leave out pieces of information but are incidentally filled in.  And I guess from the premise of the argument that it would show that there was no cooperation in certain areas between the two \u2013 But we don't have \u2013 I'm sorry, but we don't have that with the Bible, do we?

On top of that, many of those accounts were written after the fact by people who never even met or were with those people and yet include direct narratives and conversations that people had privately.  And so in filling that in, I would say that you could not say that they were... What was the word?  Undesigned?  Because... You can actually see the growth from book to book.  As time goes on, they added to the story.  And so you have, you know, the character of Jesus, Meek and Mild, you know, who said... Who said, Father, take this cup from me.  And you have this progression to a Jesus who is not only, you know, just kicking butt and taking names, but forgiving the people on either side of them and saying, you know, by the end of this day, you'll be with me in heaven.

The problem with even the gospel is just going with that because that's the bulk of what we're discussing here.  There's no extra biblical historical writing about Jesus and his activities.  In fact, history proves that some of the things that the Bible says, like there was a census when Jesus was born, that didn't happen.  Mm-hmm.  His history has shown that.  So we've got problems right out of the gate with the veracity of Scripture.  And then when we try to use Scripture to verify Scripture on top of that, and then we're looking to compare coincidences and inconsistencies, the whole thing... is problematic because there's no one in that era that's verifying that these things happen.  I mean, if you've got a zombie apocalypse going on and you've got 500 people wandering around Jerusalem at the resurrection, I would think someone would notice that. ",

If I'm God and I want to communicate with all the people of the world all throughout history the most important message in the history of mankind, I'm going to be pretty damn clear about my communications.  And just your example of whether Matthew meant that literally or it was an allegory or it was prophetic or whatever... Why is it so damn complicated?  Why does it take years, eons of people arguing about what the Bible means, what it doesn't mean?  If I'm God and I'm communicating the most important message in the history of mankind, and I'm that muddy with it, I've done a pretty poor job of communicating.  And then tack on that...
