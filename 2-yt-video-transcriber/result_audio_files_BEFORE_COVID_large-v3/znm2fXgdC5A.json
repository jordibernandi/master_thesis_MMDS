            "text": "I hear this so many times.  People ask me about this all the time, that Jesus is appearing to Muslims in dreams and visions.  What do you make of that?  Well, right off the bat, I think of Hebrews 1, 1 and 2, and Romans 10, 14.  Hebrews 1, 1 and 2, God long ago spoke to the fathers and the prophets in many portions and in many ways.  In these last days, he has spoken to us through his son.  And so God is not speaking today through dreams and visions.  Hebrews 1, 1 and 2 makes that very clear.  He has spoken to us today through his son.  And Romans 10, 14 also puts the brakes on this notion.  Paul says, how will they hear without a preacher?  Not without a dream, not without a vision.  How are they here without a preacher?  And so right off the bat, this whole notion of Jesus appearing to Muslims in dreams and vision, it has very significant theological headwinds.  And another question I would have is what makes the Muslims so special?  why isn't jesus appearing in dreams and visions to hari krishnas or to mormons or to you know?  fill in the blank.  so what makes the muslims so unique?  and these stories are notoriously hard to track down.  there's no documentation.  the best i've been able to come up with you.  you see a few accounts and it's interesting to me the ones that i have read.  this quote unquote jesus.  that appears to muslims and dreams and visions He usually sends them to bad churches.  He will send them to a Roman Catholic church or to a word of faith church.  And that's not the real Jesus.  Jesus would not send someone to a bad church.  So, yeah, it just does.  It holds no water.  It goes against scripture and it goes against plain common sense. ",
