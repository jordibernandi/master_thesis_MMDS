            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  I try to choose my words carefully.  And the word stupid, I don't like to use that word.  It's not a nice word.  However, it is biblical.  St.  Paul in Galatians chapter 3 says, O stupid Galatians, who has bewitched you?  Now, I like to reserve as much as I can the word stupid for Catholics who vote for a politician who they know will allow harm to be done to innocent people.  It was Matt Fradd who taught me this.  Check this out.  Matt Fradd says it's always wrong for a big strong person to do harm to an innocent little, helpless person.  Would anyone argue with that?  It's always wrong for a big, strong person to do harm to a little, innocent, helpless person.  Now, in the history of humanity, there has been government leaders who have killed or have been responsible for the death of millions of innocent people.  And in some cases, these government leaders were voted in by Catholics and even other Christians.  And these political leaders, they were pretty clear about what they intended to do, what their philosophy was, what their approach was.  And there's a basic truth If someone votes for a political leader who will allow harm to be done to innocent people, the person who votes for that leader is complicit in the death of the innocent.  Now, I want to dedicate this video to the second joyful mystery of the Holy Rosary.  Catholics love the Blessed Virgin Mary.  We love to pray the rosary to meditate on the mysteries.  It's the visitation when Mary visited her cousin Elizabeth.  In Luke chapter 1 it says, When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the infant leaped in her womb.  And Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said, Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.  Our Blessed Mother, pregnant with our Lord Jesus Christ, visits Elizabeth, who's pregnant with St.  John the Baptist.  And when our lady... Comes to Elizabeth.  Elizabeth is filled with joy, filled with the Holy Spirit.  And little John the Baptist leaps for joy in his mother's womb.  And Elizabeth recognizes the presence of the Savior of the world in Mary's womb.  Beautiful passage of Scripture.  Dear Catholics, don't be stupid.  If you vote for a political leader who's very open about allowing harm to be done to the most innocent and the most helpless, the most little, you are complicit in the death.  of these little ones, and you have blood on your hands, and you might, and I say this out of love and out of concern, you might spend all of eternity in hell because you did not obey God's clear commandment, thou shalt not kill.  Viva Cristo. ",
