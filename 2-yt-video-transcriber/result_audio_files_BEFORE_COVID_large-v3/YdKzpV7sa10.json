And then one can stick their mutilated chemical waste rod into the other's infection-prone people-making hole located right next to the arousing area with the forbidden chemical waste hole.  punishable by eternity in a lake of fire if penetrated.

But if they don't, it will eventually become a person that will cause the host person excruciating pain when coming out if the first people piss you off somehow. ",
