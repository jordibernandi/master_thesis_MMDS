            "text": "No.  It is.  Sir?  I can't have it in the courtroom.  I don't plan on going in the courtroom.  Just walking around the courthouse.  It can.  But it can.  That's a legal thing, not a personal thing.  I'm not going to argue with you.  I don't want to argue with you, brother.  It's not a thing about arguing.  I can film.  You're not going to film today.  But I can.  You can, but you're not going to today.  I will.  I will.  Okay.  Okay.  That's fine.  Why are you saying I can't film?  We've got children here today.  But they're in public.  This is public.  Please don't touch me.  That's an assault, okay?  Give it to me.  I tell you what, I'm going to step out here.  Go.  You put your hands on me.  That's an assault.  I don't want that to happen, okay?  I don't know what your game is.  It's not a game, Officer Crews.  And can you please call your supervisor?  Because if you put your hands on me, that's an assault.  I'm not calling a supervisor.  I'm in charge here right now.  Can I have a supervisor, please?  I don't want to be argumentative.  You can go up to the sheriff's office.  You can talk to the sheriff.  I've seen your videos and stuff before.  Okay, so you understand.  I don't want to be argumentative.  I just want to understand.  You just want to start shit.  That's all you want to do.  Why are you cursing at me, brother?  I'm not cursing at you.  I said all you want to do is start shit.  That's all you want.  I just want to be understood.  Fine.  Understood.  I just want to be understood.  Is it wrong to ask for understanding?  Put it on videos.  I don't care.  I don't.  You're not going to go in here and bother people and interrupt this court.  I'm just going to wait for the clerk of court, okay?  I said you're not going to interrupt this court.  Now you can go outside now.  Here comes the clerk of court.  Go.  I'm waiting on the clerk of court like I was told to.  I said you're not going to disturb this court.  Thank you.  This officer here has put his hands on me and I need you to call someone because he grabbed my camera.  That's an assault.  I just need you to call someone for my safety.  He put his hands on me.  He told me that this cell phone.  He's the one that goes around making videos.  Damn, shut up.  You shut your goddamn mouth.  Yes, sir.  I don't mind talking to you at all.  Thank you for coming out and talking to me.  But this officer here is way out of line.  Let me tell you that.  Way out of line.  And I want someone called on this idiot because he put his hands on me.  He put his hands on me.  I'm going to tell you, I had every legal right to defend myself.  You looked at me, I didn't put my hands on you, okay?  I had every legal right to.  I don't have to explain to you.  I don't have to explain to you, brother.  You step out here and let me tell you about that, okay?  Let me tell you something.  What?  I don't have all day to talk to you.  Please explain to him that public photography is not a crime.  That's all I need from you.  Yes, sir.  Let me hear it.  Yes, sir.  It's a public area in there.  Yes, sir.  In the bottom of the floor.  Absolutely, absolutely.  So you're welcome to video or do whatever you want to.  Okay.  In the bottom floor here where the court is not going on.  Absolutely, absolutely, and again.  You can't go into the office.  Yeah, that's fine.  I'm sorry, excuse me.  How you doing, brother?  How you doing?  Excuse me.  Should there be judicial hearings?  Yeah, sure.  As far as that?  Yeah.  Yeah, and again, like I told you, I didn't have any plans of going into courtrooms or anything.  I didn't plan on going in behind any offices, just openly family.  Yeah.  And he here doesn't understand the First Amendment, and he tried to tell me that I couldn't do it.  And that's why she told me to wait for you.  It's not mine.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  This is what I believe.  That this area right in here is a public area.  Mm-hmm.  He's welcome as long as he's not disturbing anybody, disturbing the peace, the family, whatever he wants to right in there.  He's not allowed in any of my offices because we have judicial hearings, we have all kinds of things going on.  But that little area right in there, if he's welcome.  And I can't go in court.  Yeah, absolutely.  And again, it's not if it's fine with him.  This is a tax clinic building.  I don't need his permission, but he was gentleman enough to come talk to me.  And that's all I'm saying.  I don't need your permission.  I'm only going to tell you one more time.  I don't need your permission.  He is the security.  Security, but he's not above the Constitution.  So his security does not trump my Constitution.  All right.  You put your hands on me again.  I have every legal right to defend myself because you have no reason putting your hands on me.  The Supreme Court has already ruled illegal detention and arrest can and will be resisted.  And an officer that lost that case lost his life.  Please don't put your hands on me again.  I don't want confrontation.  I want understanding, okay?  And I'm willing to love you through that because you made a mistake.  I understand that.  I don't hold that against you.  I love you through that.  Please don't put your hands on me again.  Please don't.  I'm asking you nicely.  I over-touched you.  You put your hand?  It's on camera.  I can't get your phone.  This is my property.  This is part of me.  Go.  Yes, this is mine.  Please don't put your hands in my hand.  I'm asking nicely because it won't be good.  Please don't put your hands in my hand, okay?  I don't know who hired me.  I don't.  Phone, keys, wallet.  Put your stuff in that bucket over there and let me see what you got in your pocket.  Absolutely.  Just for you, okay?  My firearm is in the car.  Wallet.  Keys, phone, camera.  Is there anything else you need?  There's nothing.  that's on me.  You should probably read my belt.  I mean, I don't know that you want me to put it in.  At this point, you're reaching, and it's amazing.  Because now you know you done messed up.  And so now you're reaching for everything you can find.  But that's fine, because I have patience.  You are.  Take your cell phone through there.  It's got to go in there.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Listen, I don't mind doing what's right, brother, okay?  I don't mind.  That's the problem you have.  You don't mind doing what's right.  You're good.  Thank you.  You've made my day.  That's okay.  I like to make people's day.  Well, I don't want you to know that there will be a complaint filed in the form of assault.  That's okay.  I know it's okay.  It's going to be very okay.  So I hope you've got a second means of taking care of your family, buddy, because you're going.  Because if you know my videos, you know who I am.  I don't know who you are.  We've just seen you watch my videos.  I have seen your videos.  Okay, well then, if you've seen my videos, you know who I am.  I don't know what you're doing.  If you can get my job, I don't need it.  I just want you to know that.  You just assaulted a law-abiding citizen by trying to take my phone.  You tried to deter my First Amendment right and entry upon this social service building because you said I couldn't do it because you didn't want it.  Because you didn't want it done.  Do you not understand the law you've broken?  Do you understand that?  Because if you're seeing my video, then you should be educated by now.  And now you're pissed off because I'm right.  I'm not pissed off.  You are.  It's okay.  Everybody has emotions, brother.  It's okay.  You messed up.  It's okay.  They hire idiots like you to come be the security in buildings that don't need you.  Dummy.  Hey, young lady, I'm sorry he spoke to you that way.  I'm terribly sorry, okay?  I am terribly sorry that he spoke to you that way.  But it's still rude for him to speak to you that way when we were as cordial as we were and he was that belligerent.  Again, I'm terribly sorry.  It's fine.  It's no problem.  Thank you.  Wow.  Yeah, that's fine.  Yes, ma'am.  I wasn't going upstairs.  Yeah, that's fine.  I spoke to the man here.  He told me that this is all fine here.  I didn't have any intention of going upstairs.  I didn't want to be a disturbance.  I was just going to come in here and leave.  Thank you, ma'am.  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  I'm sorry y'all had to witness that event.  I had that.  Let's charge it, but it's going to the sheriff.  Don't worry about it.  It's okay.  Thank you again for your professionalism.  You're going to be unemployed.  I'll see you soon in court, buddy.  Don't worry about it. ",
