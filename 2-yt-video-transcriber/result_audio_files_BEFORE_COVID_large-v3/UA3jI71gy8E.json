She goes for a long time and makes a complete turnaround, does really a great job.  They say she's become a leader.  She's working with all these girls, doing a great job.  And then she graduates, and I remember this last shot when we do this piece at the ranch.  She jumps up on this fence and is smiling and everything and waving and all.  One night home with her mother.  One night.  And her mother's finding people that are trashing her, the mother, on these social media platforms.  Her mother tracks them down, backs into who they are, gets their phone numbers, calls them up, yelling into the phone, calling them names and stuff, gets the daughter involved.  One night.  So they come back for a follow-up like, I don't know, a month or two later.  And when they come, I say, okay, we're going to have them back.  They walk out.  I have the audience completely empty.  I have nobody there to play to.  I mean, 250 chairs, empty, nobody in the house but me, the mother, and the daughter. ",
