Share my videos.  Subscribe to my second channel, Alan Roberts, in my opinion.  Of course, I'm going to be above and below it in all those places.  And by the way, that is where you can find the old roasts of this young man, Tyrone Essex, otherwise known as the Fitness Addict.  I will normally, when I make future content about him, I normally just put it on my comedy channel because this motherfucker is free fucking comedy.  He is, it is so good that he lives at home with his mama.  I mean, I know it sucks being like a mid-20s, late-20s person, you know, having to live at home with your parents.  But in reality, they are more like caretakers.  I mean, there's a few videos, if you are not familiar, he has a few cooking videos where I don't even know how he literally survived making the video.  And that's not even a joke.  I mean, it is a joke because he's a joke, but that's not even really a joke.  He is just one of the more, I don't know, stupid people I've ever come across.  And I actually stopped making videos on him for a while because my wife felt like I was picking on somebody.  that was that fucking stupid.  And then she saw a video of him making fun of other people, and it's fucking game on again.  So what's up, Tyrone?  How the fuck you doing?  You have me blocked everywhere, but I'm sure you're going to watch this because most bitches do.  But!  The reason why he's on the main channel right now is because I normally reserve the main channel for people that are either bullshitting about fitness, giving poor fitness advice, or generalized fitness advice in general.  he is giving dangerous fitness advice often like the last video i did about him was on the on the other channel.  you can go check that out link above all those places.  go check it out like and subscribe.  make sure you hit the notification bell.  um it was him showing up drunk at three o'clock in the morning working out like.  i mean it's just stupid.  you know i mean i. i understand.  like.  When I entered Tyrone's life, his channel was doing really, really good, and I fucking decimated it because I pointed out that he's just a fucking ignorant idiot.  And I still would like an explanation from Chris Jones.  Next time we talk offline, Chris Jones, I want an explanation of why you brought this motherfucker into our lives.  What's up, Chris?  Congratulations on the baby.  So... But this video, he's making another protein shake.  He did a homemade protein shake video before where he had some difficulties deciding whether they were, what he was putting in was raspberry or strawberries.  And by difficulties, I mean, it says raspberries on the fucking box, on the fucking container, and he still called them strawberries over fucking over again.  Anyway, but he's going to continue to make his videos.  And here is his newest homemade protein shake. ",

Protein shakes are... inexpensive relatively per gram of protein and convenient.  That's the thing.  You can carry the protein shake along with you.  You cannot, you know, in the form of a powder and just mix water or whatever.  You can't really carry a steak in your pocket most of the time.

That's if it's whey or whey isolate or something like that, and that's about the average, and they don't want anything else.  Most people just want to supplement their protein when they think of a protein shake, and Tyrone here, now has about 18 grams of protein in the three fucking handfuls, the close to 500 calories worth of almond seeds, dumbass, that he put in there.  He's got very minimal, very, very minimal protein from the syrup and frozen fruit, because the idiot let the bag melt.  and he has about 10 grams of protein in the glass not cup glass of milk and about another 11 grams of saturated fat.  so he's looking at somewhere around 25 grams of protein right now for around 900 calories.  that's how idiotic this could classify as a meal replacement shake but it is not a protein shake now we are not even at the dangerous portion yet but this gets so.  he is so detached from understanding what he is actually doing.  this kid is lean by accident.  i i have raised the hypothesis before that he is fed.  Like, I mean, like, he does actually very little on his own.  Like, his handlers, meaning his family and his coaches or whatever, they tell him what to eat, they give him the food he's allowed, they actually take care of him, they tie his shoes, that sort of thing, they pay his bills, because he has no, clearly, no fucking idea what he's talking about.

They just say shit, put shit out there to fucking, just to fucking put information out and hopefully get an audience.  The idea is, is you want to educate your audience, not give them stupid fucking advice like this dumbass fucking shake.  So Tyrone... My offer is very genuine.  You can sit down at your mama's dining room table and me and you can do a live Skype conversation and we can record it and we can just go live right on fucking YouTube or whatever.  And I would love to hear how you are some sort of fucking genius that has figured out all the fucking secrets and you want to make it simple for everybody.  Because trust me, motherfucker, anything you say is fucking simple because you are one simple motherfucker.  And that's just my two cents a matter.  My name's Alan Roberts.  Hit me up on Instagram at Everyday Fitness.  Hit me up on Twitter at Everyday Fitness.  I'm also on Facebook at Everyday Fitness.  On the internet, whateverdayfitness.net.  And Tyrone has me blocked on almost all those things.  Goddamn. ",
