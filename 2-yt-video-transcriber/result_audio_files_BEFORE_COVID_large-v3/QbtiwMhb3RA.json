Thankfully, nothing happened.  But you guys got to hear the crap that came out of this cop's mouth.  Here we go. ",

You're all by yourself, and there's a lot of people who don't like the cops, and we're not going to know what happened to you until days later when we find you in the bushes.  I'm pretty sure that cop would have looked at me and said, is that a threat?  Is that a threat?  Double standards, 100%.  All right, guys, this is A.B.  Watchman.  You make sure you go check out Jet 888.  Once again, I will share the link down in the description.  And you guys, you know, let me know what you think down below in the comment section.  It's AV Watchman, and I'm signing out.  Appreciate all your love and all your support.  I know it's been a minute since I posted any videos.  Um, I will be uploading again here soon.  Pretty much, I've just been sitting back and just watching.  And, um, you know, keeping an eye on these sheriffs out this way in Lancaster.  And, um, I mean, basically, if anybody is out there and you're thinking about doing this cop watching stuff, you need to know something.  It's going to take a really wealthy person to fight these these agencies to fight back.  I mean, having a job, having bills to pay.  you know, house bills, food, cell phone bills, and stuff like that.  I mean, just a regular job, it's not going to help.  It's not going to help you with attorney fees.  It's not going to help you with your bail bonds fees.  So keep it in mind that if we don't have the support, I mean, 100% support, with the whole community standing behind you, standing behind us or standing behind you, then you're going to have to be pretty wealthy in order to fight back.  So you guys keep that in mind.  Most folks are not going to tell you this, but I happen to give a damn, and I've seen it firsthand, what they do and how they try to drain you.  All right, guys, Amy Watchman and I'm signing out. ",
