            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  Our ministry receives many emails from people asking questions and I want to address this on video today.  With the permission of Nancy from Tennessee, Nancy's question is a very good question that I will try to address in context by the glory and praise of Yeshua.  Nancy writes, I've been working for a computer company for 12 years.  In my company, most of the people that work are believers.  Recently, I've been relocated to a different location.  I am very discouraged because in my new location, there are almost no believers.  I don't know why God has moved me to this place.  Nancy, thank you again for your email and thank you for allowing us to address this email live on camera.  Well, first of all, that is a very good question, and I'm sure it's a question that has been asked by many people.  Why am I in this job?  Why am I surrounded by so many people that are non-believers that speak, engage about things that have nothing to do with the Bible, and I feel like an outsider?  It's wonderful to work in a company where you're surrounded with fellowship, but sometimes God moves you to a different location.  in order to be a light in the dark world.  Most people think that the reason they have a job is to provide for their families, and that's part of it.  But God can provide for you from manna from heaven.  He can provide for you in many ways.  We are all called to be ambassadors for the kingdom.  We are priests, and he's our high priest.  Our main focus should always be the gospel.  And one of the main reasons that God has positioned us to be where we are is to be a light in this dark world.  Jesus, Yeshua, is the light of the world.  And he said in Matthew 5, verse 14, So sometimes God will pull you out of the place where you are, your comfort zone, and put you in a dark place.  In order to be a shiny light.  All of us have been called to full-time ministry.  Maybe your workplace is your ministry where God has positioned you to be.  maybe if you're a university student you've been positioned there.  that's your ministry.  maybe you work in a bank.  that's your ministry.  maybe you're a bus driver.  that's your ministry.  maybe you're a house mother a grandmother wherever god has positioned you to be.  that is where you are to be a minister and nancy according to the word of god if god has moved you from the presence of believers and put you in the dark place.  that means he has promoted you to be a light in this dark world, in the kingdom you've been promoted.  Let us all shine the light of Yeshua, Jesus, wherever we are.  Isaiah chapter 60, verse 1.  Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you.  And in Hebrew, And in Hebrew, Let's continue to shine the light of Yeshua, Jesus, work the harvest together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem, and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Al Yehudah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, Amen.
