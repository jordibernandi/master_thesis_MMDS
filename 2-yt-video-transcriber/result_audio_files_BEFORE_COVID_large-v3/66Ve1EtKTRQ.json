            "text": "Hi brothers and sisters, this is Pastor Tim Henderson.  The words I'm feeling in my spirit to share with you doesn't mean it's my last video.  I'm not setting a time.  I am saying it's imminent, the rapture of the church.  This is a final warning from Jesus.  Jesus wants us Everyone to know that He loves them.  He loves you so much.  He, always having been God, eternally self-existent God in the persons of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, left glory, laid down His glory, was wrapped in flesh, born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, and willingly shed His blood on the cross at Calvary to pay the debt, the ransom price for your sin.  He became sin that we might become the righteousness of God.  He died, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  Hallelujah.  You believe that, as Romans 10, 9, and 10 says.  You call on the name of the Lord, as Romans 10, 13 says, and you will be saved.  I want to read for you from the Amplified, 1 Corinthians chapter 15, 1 to 4.  And now... let me remind you, since it seems to have escaped you, brethren of the gospel, the glad tidings of salvation, which I proclaim to you, which you welcomed and accepted upon which your faith rests, and by which you are saved if you hold fast and keep firmly what I preach to you, unless you believed at first without effect and all for nothing.  For I passed on to you, first of all, what I also had received, that Christ... The Mashiach, the Messiah, the anointed one, died for our sins in accordance with what the scriptures foretold from Isaiah 53, 5 to 12.  That he was buried, that he arose on the third day as the scriptures foretold.  You can find that in Psalm 16, 9 and 10.  Jesus, it comes down to this.  He shed his precious blood for you.  He died, he was buried, and rose on the third day.  If we believe this, On his redemptive work.  We know that we're sinners.  We admit we're sinners.  The A, we call it the ABCs.  We admit we're sinners.  We believe on his redemptive atoning work on the cross at Calvary.  And we call on the name of the Lord.  We are saved.  Hallelujah.  That's it.  That's it.  We are saved.  Ephesians 2, 8, and 9.  And some people say, well, you keep preaching this.  Yes.  Listen, time is of the essence.  Ephesians 2.8.9, for we are saved by grace through faith and not of ourselves.  It is the gift of God.  He did it all.  Jesus did it.  It's the free gift, we call it, of salvation.  Not by works, lest anyone should boast.  We are not saved by works.  You're not saved by living well.  You're not saved by going to church.  You're not saved by any works.  Nothing you did.  It's all about what Jesus did.  We're not kept saved by those things.  The precious blood of Jesus paid the debt once and for all for my past, present, and future sins.  I am in perfect, perfect, it doesn't get better, position to a holy God.  because of the blood of the Lamb, because of what Jesus did, because of his death, burial, and resurrection, I believe.  I'm in perfect position of God.  Now, I am not perfect in performance, but the day is coming very soon where 1 Thessalonians 4, 13 to 18, the Lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God.  The dead in Christ shall rise first, and then those of us who are alive will be called up together with them in the air.  And we'll be with the Lord forever.  We are told to encourage one another with these words.  Brothers and sisters, we are soon out of here.  Praise God.  We are soon out of here.  We encourage one another with these words.  But now is the time.  Today is the day of salvation.  I feel my spirit.  I have to send that warning out.  If you have not believed on Jesus, today is your day.  If you say, I just can't.  I just don't know if it's real.  If you're sincere wanting to know the truth, you call today.  Upon the name of Jesus.  You call out to the Lord.  And say Lord.  I want to believe.  But I don't know that I. Just be honest with God.  If you are sincere.  And want to know.  I'm going to encourage you.  Get a Bible.  Open it up.  Read the Gospel of John.  But talk to the Lord.  If you are sincere.  I believe with all my being.  Holy Spirit is going to do that.  Regenerating work in your life.  In your spirit.  Brothers and sisters.  I keep saying, he's here now.  Meaning, it's at any moment.  And I just want you to know, he loves you fiercely and passionately.  I love you too.  This is the last video for a little bit today.  I already know that should the Lord tarry, should he be willing, there's another one that I have.  But you know, I'm not guaranteed my next breath.  I've got to drive here soon.  And then I'll be a while because they're doing injections in my eye.  And I don't know how soon I'll be able to drive back.  But it's okay.  God will set divine appointments.  I'll be near a mall.  I'll do a walk.  And I know the Lord will use it.  Hallelujah.  In the next 60 seconds, approximately 105 people will breathe their last breath and go into the rest of eternity.  Where will they spend the rest of eternity?  Apart from Christ, they will spend it in hell.  With him, it will be in glory.  And what people don't seem to fathom, the love of God is so great.  Who has known such love?  While we were yet sinners, Jesus died for us.  The love of God is so amazing.  So, oh, who can put words to it?  The anger, the judgment, the wrath of God is equally perfected.  And what is about to hit the planet is the wrath of God.  Today is your day of salvation.  That tribulation period is directed toward the nation of Israel and the justification of the Jewish people.  We know that there'll be tribulation saints, but the literal hell you will have to live through that you may not even live through and having to be beheaded or take the mark of the beast.  If you take the mark of the beast, it's over.  And I've done videos on that.  Now, now is the time.  I beseech you.  I implore you with a final warning.  That's what I get in my spirit.  Not that I won't be doing other videos.  We don't know the moment, but we know we're in that season.  I don't even care who thinks I'm crazy.  And I want to say this.  I want to say this to those who disagree.  my pre-tribulation theory.  I love you.  I love you.  God loves you.  And you know what, brothers and sisters, we have brothers and sisters who feel differently on this.  It doesn't matter because we're going to be caught up together anyway, right?  So it doesn't matter.  Now, to those who are denying Christ came in the flesh, this Hebrew roots thing.  They're not saved.  Pray for their salvation.  Seriously, pray for them.  Don't be angry.  Some of you, you're letting those things get to you.  Look at them.  Look through the eyes of Jesus.  Let's love one another in this season.  1 John 4, 7, and 8 says, Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.  He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.  So brothers and sisters, let's love one another.  Our purpose is to worship him in spirit and in truth, build one another up in the faith, and reach out with the love of Christ to a lost and dying world.  Let's take that opportunity.  We are in the final moments.  Well, I know I've been like, whew, going, but I was up.  I was praying and inspired to do this.  I want you to know he loves you so much, so fiercely and passionately.  I love you too.  God bless you guys.  Have an awesome rest of the day.  May you be led by Holy Spirit with divine appointments and share.  the gospel of grace.  It is the free gift of salvation.  Hallelujah.  Let's just praise Jesus for a minute.  Jesus, thank you.  Thank you for loving us so much that you would shed your precious blood on the cross at Calvary to pay the debt once and for all, all sufficient for our sins.  We love you.  We honor you.  We adore you.  And we praise you.  And we are so excited that soon, hallelujah, soon, We are going to be with you forever.  In the meantime, Holy Spirit, guide us and lead us and use us in these final moments of the end of days.  And we give you all glory in the name above every name, the name of Jesus.  Amen. ",
