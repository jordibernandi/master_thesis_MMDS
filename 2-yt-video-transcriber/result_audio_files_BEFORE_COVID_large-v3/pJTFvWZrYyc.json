            "text": "Fewer than 6% of children in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden are poor.  But these countries have higher birth rates to single women than the US, where over 20% of children are poor.  And yet, one of the fiercest American cultural symbols of the late 20th century, and the current one, is the nuclear family.  When conservatives bring up traditional family values or blame poverty on non-nuclear families, they're ignoring a host of factors.  Often, their criticism is reserved for black people.  This isn't a new shtick either.  In 1889, a historian wrote to popular acclaim that the problems of black Americans were not due to poverty, discrimination, or racism, but to defects in their family and personal lives.  This is despite the fact that between 1855 and 1880, 70-90% of black households contained two parents and at least 70% were nuclear.  By the time the rollbacks of reconstruction took effect and limited the employment opportunities of black men, these demographics had changed.  Since emancipation, black people have had their economic struggles blamed on absentee fathers and single mothers in a blatant comparison to the fantasy of white family life.  Take the symbolic show Father Knows Best.  When it ran from 1954 to 1960, only 11% of American families had a similar setup of a married couple and biological children.  It was the post-World War II era, and though many white women had worked outside of the home during the war, they were expected to quit for returning vets.  Women who had come to enjoy the independence and income refused, but many were fired anyways or relegated to women's work, aka clerical and service positions.  All were encouraged to find happiness in home and family.  A 1947 book on the modern woman accused women who sought educational or employment equality of engaging in symbolic castration of men.  Thanks to suburbia, economic boosts, consumerism, and conformity culture resulting from the threat of communism, the nuclear family was born.  but it wasn't the reality of all or even most Americans.  The strong male head of house who worked while his wife stayed at home was not more common than households involving two working parents, working children, extended families, or one working parent.  Race and class played a major role in whether or not an American family could be traditional in the 50s, though the 1950s family itself was a new invention.  For starters, during the late 19th century, most working class families couldn't rely solely on a male breadwinner.  and women often stayed at home to do housework, meaning often it was children sent out into the world and forced to work, a trend that continued into the 20s.  In 1929, it was found that three-fifths of American families earned less than $2,000 a year and couldn't save money.  Fast forward past the Great Depression and World War II, when many white Americans benefited from the GI Bill propelling them into the middle class, they left roughly 25% of the population in poverty in the 50s.  These poor people didn't always have the luxury of having a nuclear family because of budget constraints that affected quality of housing and how often parents were away from children.  At the time, the poverty rate of two-parent black homes was 50%, about the same rate as one-parent homes.  And until the 1960s, 75% of black households with a child under 18 had two parents.  This didn't save black families from poverty because unemployment and discrimination were the problems, not the racist generalizations of irresponsible black single mothers and absentee fathers.  Rich two-parent homes could also afford help for raising children or maintaining a household, and still do, which can't be said for poor two-parent homes.  Another interesting thing about the fantasy of nuclear families was that during the 50s, two million legally married people lived in separate homes.  Domestic abuse was not a priority in the eyes of the law either.  It wouldn't gain attention until the 1970s when the nuclear family model had grown to roughly 40% of households having a married couple with children.  But other family styles grew too, including same sex couplings, couples with adopted kids, single parent homes, remarried step families, and even more importantly, couples with no kids at all.  And about that single black mother rate, according to historian Stephanie Koontz, the rising proportion of single mother families among blacks resulted from both the declining birth rate of married black women and a drop in marriage and remarriage rates.  Affecting the marriage rates most of all was unemployment.  One study found that employed black men were two and a half times more likely to marry the mother of their child than unemployed men.  Koontz also noted the black men most likely to leave their families when faced with unemployment or income loss are those who subscribe most firmly to the idea of a self-reliant male breadwinner.  In other words, pride is a motherfucker.  In the military, where income is standardized by rank and doesn't fluctuate by race, a study during peacetime found that black enlistees are as likely to marry as white ones and have lower divorce rates than their white peers.  This shows that when provided stable income, marriage is sought out by black Americans.  But how important is the nuclear family in alleviating poverty?  A University of Michigan study of income dynamics found that only one-seventh of childhood transitions into poverty were caused by families breaking up, and more than half were linked to changes in the labor market or economy.  You hear that?  Two parents doesn't guarantee happiness or wealth.  Poor two-parent homes are two times as likely to divorce than other families, and 40% of America's poor children live in two-parent homes.  This isn't to say that nuclear families are bad.  This means that more nuclear families won't bring about more resources or a better life, but living wages and affordable cost of living will.  Child poverty is a major issue that requires more discourse than take responsibility for opening your legs, especially in the black community.  It boils down to having viable employment opportunities and affordable cost of living and housing, not a certain type of family structure.  According to a huge report funded by bipartisan members of Congress that sought to find out how to cut child poverty in half, child poverty costs America between $800 billion and $1.1 trillion every year due to increased crime, debt, and health issues.  First of all, the authors of the report denied that work requirements, marriage promotion, and subsidizing long-acting reversible contraceptives are sufficient for ending child poverty.  Consider that millions of dollars were poured into marriage promotion programs in the 90s, and that one study of 7,000 single mothers who married in that period found that two-thirds of them went on to divorce in the 2000s.  The authors of 2019's child poverty report found that boosting minimum wage, providing yearly child allowances in the range of $1,200 to $2,700, and making the childcare tax credit fully refundable are the true ways to alleviate child poverty.  Basically, it comes down to this.  The propagation of the nuclear family as the thing that will strengthen the black race is shrouded not just in ineffective respectability politics for misogynists and homophobes, but also a ready-made excuse for the greedy and racist policy makers and corporations who exacerbate wealth disparity in the black community.  They ignore mass incarceration, rising housing costs, stagnant wages, and other factors that impact black wealth to place the sole blame on irresponsible black mothers and weak black fathers.  Don't believe the hype. ",
