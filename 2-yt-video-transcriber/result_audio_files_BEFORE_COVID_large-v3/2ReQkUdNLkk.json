They all seem to be doing just fine.  I don't think any of them have felt violence because they listened to a lecture on basic facts about our immigration system.  The question was, have I asked people in this room if they've felt as though some violence has been committed on them?  No, I haven't asked because no violence has been committed on you.  Because violence is not a subjective feeling.  Violence is an objective fact.  And I would say to you, as a faculty member at a taxpayer-funded university, this is the foundation of liberal education.  If you cannot understand that there is a difference between speech and violence, you don't understand anything that undergirds the liberal arts or liberal education.  And that is a real shame.  And I say this with all respect and with great distress for our universities.  If our teachers don't understand the difference between ideas and violence, between speech and violence, then they are in no position to educate the next generation of Americans.  I was asked to give a speech in defense of George Washington at George Washington University.  George Washington, one of the greatest men who ever lived, and specifically in this case, George the colonial, who is the mascot of GW, as well as all of those colonials who gave this world and gave all of us this great nation.  I think ignorance plays a major role here in the effort to get rid of GW's colonial mascot and moniker, George himself.  The activists make a number of mistakes, not merely in their logic, but even in their grasp of basic facts.  The first of which is to whom the word colonials refers.  The colonials that the mascot represents were not defenders of colonialism.  In fact, they were the opposite of defenders of colonialism.  They fought a bloody war.  They risked their lives to end colonialism in America and to end rule in Great Britain.  They wanted their political independence.  Oh, these kids are really proving me wrong.  You see, because my premise was that these students are ignorant and not well-behaved.  But they're proving me wrong tonight.  They called me a fascist for defending George Washington.  Behold your country, leftists. ",

I was promised certain costs for Obamacare and there was a lot of fuzzy math because the taxes kicked in early and the benefits didn't kick in quite so early.  So the question is twofold.  One, you're asking economically, you're saying that the current healthcare regime is not efficient.  And therefore, the socialist regime would be more efficient.  That may actually be the case.  That's not an argument for socialism, though.  That's an argument for liberalization.  That's for liberalizing the markets, making prices much more apparent to both the consumers and the service providers, to opening up what are now virtual monopolies for health insurance companies.  And fortunately, by the way, this administration has, around the edges, worked on all of those things.  There is also a moral argument as well.  which is that people ought to be free, man ought to be free, and if health care is going to have to be rationed, I would rather it be rationed by me and my freedom of choice than by some bureaucratic board somewhere in the federal government.  If the United States stops leading the way in health care, you're going to see that affect global markets and global health care regimes all around the world, and it will be a very bad thing.  And that is the reason that people, when they actually want care, living in Cuba, living in Canada, living in the United States, when even their private insurance that they're forced to buy doesn't cover it, that's why they come to the United States, because we're the leaders.

Why not convert to some... hypothetical, clean, wonderful avatar energy source.  Show me the energy source that could provide American energy.  You talk about how we have reliance on foreign fuels.  We found that biggest oil deposit ever in 2016.  We're the biggest producer in the world.  This is a wonderful thing.  This is something that we should embrace.  This idea of scarcity is a fiction.  This idea that we're just depleting our resources and they'll all be gone in 15 years.  The question you asked is, what is the downside of killing off eighty eight percent of the american economy outlawing?  i'm i'm uh... you asked it and i'm relating to the green new deal of outlawing gas powered cars within ten years of outlawing jet fuel powered jets.  within ten years of knocking down a rebuilding all the buildings within ten years.  what's the downside of spending ninety three trillion dollars eighty percent marginal tax rates killing american ingenuity and then once you kill off all of the people who make all the jobs and who but grow our economy?  then you just start printing money making the global reserve currency, I don't know, like the paper in Venezuela.
