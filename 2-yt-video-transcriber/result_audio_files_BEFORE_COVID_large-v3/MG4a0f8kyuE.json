I truly believe that visibility is the key to creating real change, real positive change in the world.  And that's why we're here today.  Because every one of you is having an impact through being here together, being your true, authentic self.  Today is about celebrating our right to be who we are.  Not just to be accepted, but to live our lives without limitation.  If you have a dream, go out there and get it.  Believe it's yours for the taking.  Trans men are men!  Trans women are women!
