            "text": "Hi there, it's Zee, and in this video I want to teach you the basics of a spectrogram.  So let's get started.  So first off, that's a spectrogram, and it allows us to see sound in three dimensions.  We have the first dimension, which is frequency, and that goes up and down on the y-axis like so.  So you'll see that this Little piece up here goes up and then it goes down, right?  So that's displaying the frequency measured in hertz, okay?  Now it also shows us time, which is on the x-axis, and we can see that here.  So as the sounds occur further apart, naturally the spacing and the display of it shows that they're further apart.  So we have time and we have frequency.  And then the last thing that we get to see from this is amplitude, okay?  Now let's take a look at this.  Notice how as the sounds get louder and quieter, you see that when they're loud, there's that hot intense heat map, that bright orange, right?  And then when it's very quiet, there's that faint blue.  Now we can change that color layout to anything we want, but basically this shows us like a thermal heat map of volume or amplitude.  So those are the three dimensions of sound and you can recreate any sound that has ever existed with just those three dimensions.  frequency, time, and amplitude.  And they are all perfectly displayed on a spectrogram here.  Now, you'll notice that that was just one straight line, right?  That typically doesn't exist in nature.  In nature, we have what are called harmonics typically occurring when we hear a pitch.  Like these lines, yeah?  And those exist in any physical object that creates a pitch.  Now let's take a look at an actual real instrument or a digital reconstruction of a real instrument.  So here you can see a flute with some reverb and a hall and we can see the individual notes of the flute.  and you can see there are lots of harmonics, right?  Like all these extra little streaks here are harmonics and you can see how the room is causing the sounds to sustain and almost blur into each other.  So even the very room that you exist inside changes the way the frequencies behave inside them, okay?  You will see each of these harmonics gaining volume right there.  Now the resonance is there, now it's there.  And you can see how these harmonics are individually getting louder or quieter.  That's what I do in my voice when I do this.  It's the exact same process.  So resonance modifies the relative amplitude or volume of these harmonics, which comprise the sound, okay?  Sounds are not just one sound.  They are typically infinite nests of other frequencies.  And we make those louder or quieter to change the timbre of our sound.  Let's take a look at some more sounds.  Let's take a look at, I don't know, like a drum set.  So a drum set might look like this.  These actually have a chaotic amount of frequencies because they don't produce exact pitches.  So they just kind of push air everywhere and you get these signatures.  You can see here that there's like kick drums there, the snare drums right there.  So you can tell whenever there's a snare drum.  Now let's look at a piece of music and see what that looks like.  A piece of music has lots of stuff going on at once.  So you're gonna see tons of frequencies all over the place.  You can see the kick drum, the 808 right there, right?  That's this low frequency.  The snare is this huge streak of frequencies.  And so that's what we're looking at when we deal with sound.  Now essentially all sounds are just arrangement of these frequencies in various volumes and various times.  Lastly, I wanna show you what human voices look like on a spectrogram.  I'm gonna demonstrate using my voice.  Now, here's what a live microphone looks like.  Apparently there's some noise in my room, so we can see really low frequency noise down there, right?  And we can see that my voice has lots of harmonics.  Right?  Those lines are harmonics.  Now watch me change gender. ",

            "text": "Um, okay, so like if I talk in this voice and I keep it at this kind of pitch, and then I talk in like a female version of that pitch. ",

            "end_time": "00:06:08,900",
            "text": "You can see here in the female one, there's all this brighter stuff going on than the male one, right?  Those higher harmonics are activated.  So we can use a spectrogram to measure if our voice is sort of moving more feminine or more masculine.  The pitch should stay the same, but we should see greater brightness or greater intensity, greater amplitude on these higher harmonics like so.  Or like this.  And you can see that when I raise my resonance really bright, like my pitch wobbled a little bit, right?  That was just bad control.  But you can see how we can observe all these amazing details about the sound, thanks to a spectrogram.  And all it shows us is frequency, time, and amplitude, which are the ingredients that build every sound that you've ever heard.  Okay?  so i hope you learned a little bit about spectrograms today.  there's a lot more to learn and there's so many cool uses for them.  um and below in the description i will put a link to a freeware one that you can use.  if you have any questions or comments please feel free to post below.  i love interacting with you all down there.
