            "text": "Thank you, America, for liberating Hondurans from their votes in the 2017 election.  We're at the Sotocano Pamarola Air Base.  This is the largest US military base in Latin America.  It is the center of US influence, not just in Honduras, but across the entire region and it's really why the US is fighting so hard to preserve the corrupt and deeply unpopular government of Juan Orlando Hernandez.  because this country Honduras is strategically located and so it's a place where the US projects its power towards Venezuela, towards Nicaragua towards Cuba.  In fact, during the 1980s, this base was a staging point for counterinsurgency operations by the U.S.-backed Contras overseen by John D. Negroponte in hunter-killer operations that killed as many as 30,000 people in a covert war inside Nicaragua against the Socialist Sandinista movement.  Right behind me you see a sign for an international airport that's under construction over there.  But behind that is the air base and it's absolutely massive.  I mean, if you can see these mountains over here, The base extends all the way to the foot of the mountains.  It's basically a city where some 500 to 600 US troops live.  Now they claim that it's a Honduran air base, but people in Honduras consider that an absolute joke.  This is a US air base.  It's where the US flies large Chinook troop transport helicopters to use in uh the war on drugs operations across latin america.  also blackhawk helicopters which are smaller troop transport helicopters that have offensive capacity are based here and larger u.s aircraft.  you can see right here some graffiti and it says fuera ho there's actually graffiti that's been put all over the walls of this base which is People in this country are outraged that this base is here because there's no war going on in this country and this base is actually the source of the repression that so many people feel.  It's where Honduran military train with the  U.S.,  especially the Honduran military police who are used as a private Praetorian guard for Juan Orlando Hernandez, the repressive and corrupt U.S.-backed regime, which has stolen two elections.  Let's walk over here.  Let's go under this sign.  Up here, you're going to see the entrance to the air base, and you can see military personnel with their cars here.  I'm not sure if we're supposed to be here or not, but, you know, we're going to go up there, and there is what looks like a A World War II era P-51 Mustang plane, a replica of one.  And you can see some of the facilities up here.  I don't know, these are taxis and cars for people coming out of the base.  But just to get a sense of how big the base is, let's go take a peek through the fence, just to get a sense of how massive this complex is.  This is actually the only real U.S.  military base in Latin America.  since the ousted progressive Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa removed U.S.  military bases from Ecuador, and he said that he would allow the base to stay in Ecuador on one condition, which is that Ecuador gets to have a base in Miami, and of course the U.S.  refused.  Here, let's take a look in here.  Just pop that through there.  You can see some golf carts to escort U.S.  military personnel and You know, this is what it looks like.  And again, the base extends all the way to the foot of that mountain.  Here, let's walk over to the entrance.  Hope I don't wind up with a sack over my head.  I mean, this was a literal death squad center.  This was the death squad center in Latin America.  But you know, I'm an American.  This is my tax dollars at work, and I demand a look.  Thank you, America, for liberating Hondurans from their votes in the 2017 election.  All right, so, yeah, cool little plane.  We got some little, Little mortars.  These are like tiny little mortar bombs.  I don't think you could fit a 12-year-old in there, but it's a tribute to the greatness.  It actually has a Honduran flag on it.  And this is from the Honduran Air Force.  This is the planes, I guess, they get.  I don't know.  They don't get the best technology.  They certainly don't get what the Israelis get.  Speaking of the Israelis, Honduran media is reporting that 1,000 Israeli soldiers are either on the way to Palmarola Air Base or are here.  Israel is one of the top three military. ",
