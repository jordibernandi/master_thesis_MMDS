            "text": "Donald Trump put out some tweets.  Many people immediately got offended and said that his tweets were racist.  when he said these progressive congressmen should go back to their countries, figure out what works, and then bring it back, tell us, you know, what they did.  Many people said it's an old racist trope about go back to where you came from.  Now I criticized Trump when he did this, as did many other conservatives without realizing this was probably part of a bigger strategy.  See, Nancy Pelosi had been attacking Ocasio-Cortez and there was a lot of bickering going back and forth.  This was showing the American people, the Democrats were standing up to the far left.  Trump forced them to circle the wagons and put AOC and the other far-left Democrats front and center.  Even Ezra Klein of Vox said Trump is trying to frame his narrative that Democrats are far-left and socialist.  But Trump's plan has worked beyond even, I'd imagine, better than he could have even imagined.  Because now the House is in disarray.  Chaos, they say.  In fact, here's the story.  House thrown into chaos after Pelosi decries Trump's racist tweets on the floor.  She broke decorum.  She wasn't allowed to speak.  That's my understanding.  We'll read the story.  And one Democrat even stormed out saying nothing was getting done for the American people.  Trump's plan.  Brilliant.  So I'll absolutely criticize his tweets as distasteful.  but you can't call him tactless.  It works perfectly into his strategy.  Aside from this news, we're going to be digging into these stories.  The biggest story I believe of Trump's presidency is that he's made moves to end asylum for Central Americans.  And where is the mainstream media?  Where is the outrage?  Where is the story?  Where is Nancy Pelosi bickering over tweets?  The madman's done it.  I'm shocked and impressed at the same time.  With only a string of tweets, he has been able to distract the press and the Democrats from a major story and send them into complete chaos.  So the first story we're going to start with is the House being thrown into chaos.  But I do want to mention one point from this New York Times story before we get started.  Head over to timcast.com slash donate if you'd like to support my work.  There's a PayPal option, a crypto option, a physical address.  But the best thing you can do, share this video on social media because YouTube no longer suggests independent commentators the same way they used to.  They actually derank us.  That means I rely on word of mouth if you think people should hear what I have to say.  And I greatly appreciate it if you do.  The first thing I want to highlight, New York Times writes, Trump sets the 2020 tone like 2016, only this time the squad is here.  Particularly, I want to highlight this passage.  They say Trump has told aides, in fact, he is pleased with the Democratic reaction to his attacks, boasting that he is marrying the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party to the four congresswomen known as the squad.  For those that have missed the other, the past couple of videos I've made, a poll from Axios came out showing that in swing states, people find AOC to be very unfavorable.  Around 72 or 73% of people know who she is, but only 22% like her.  Ilhan Omar only has a 9% favorability.  Trump knows he needs them to be the face of the Democratic Party so that he can win in 2020 and the Republicans can reclaim the House.  Well, this is the story I've gone over.  So that's the context.  And here's the latest update.  it's worked better than Trump could have imagined.  The Democrats are fighting each other.  They're breaking House rules, throwing the Democrats into chaos.  Trump's over simple tweets.  Trump has caused massive damage to the Democrats.  And I gotta say, I'm shocked.  Let's read the story from Politico.  House thrown into chaos after Pelosi decries Trump's racist tweets on floor.  They say... The House voted along party lines to allow Speaker Nancy Pelosi to call President Donald Trump's tweets about minority Democratic lawmakers racist in the congressional record on Tuesday, overriding a parliamentary ruling and GOP objections.  Pelosi's comments were initially ruled out of order on the floor itself.  A small victory for the Republicans during a tense day in which both sides exchanged accusations of racism, hypocrisy, and indecorous behavior unworthy of Congress or the country.  The drama over Pelosi's comments sure to rankle Trump played out before the House voted 240 to 187 to condemn Trump's weekend tweets about four Democratic members of color.  They go on to mention AOC and Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar,  etc.,  House members aren't allowed to refer to Trump or his tweets as racist when speaking on the floor, even though the resolution they voted on Tuesday said as much.  These rules on floor decorum are part of a package the body approved on the first day of current Congress.  So listen, not only did Trump send the House into chaos, he got them to break their own rules, and they got them to pass a resolution that actually they weren't allowed to say.  The resolution was decrying Trump as racist.  They weren't allowed to speak it based on their own rules.  This is ridiculous.  Not only do they have the far left congressman, which many people don't like front and center, they're fighting now.  Trump has just, he's just sent the whole Democrats, the Democratic Party is in chaos.  Let's read on.  That led to a bizarre scene on Tuesday.  Only clerks reading the resolution aloud were allowed to say the resolution condemned Trump's quote racist tweets, demonstrating once again how different lawmaking is from real life.  The chaotic dispute began when Pelosi went to the floor to bash Trump over his tweets about the squad as the four freshman lawmakers referred to themselves.  Trump said the four Democrats should go back and help fix the totally broken crime infested places from which they came after incorrectly stating they were originally from the countries.  Trump's tweets caused an immediate uproar throughout Washington.  But let's let's move on from this.  They say Pelosi decided to push the limits.  Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president's racist tweets, Pelosi said during her floor speech.  To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.  Republicans immediately objected.  Doug Collins asked Pelosi to rephrase her statement, and when she refused, he sought to have the words stricken from official record.  No speaker has had their words taken down as the process is referred to in 35 years.  And even challenging a speaker's comments is considered a serious breach of etiquette.  Collins request led to a nearly two hour delay in floor proceedings.  Now here is the part where I was actually shocked.  Rep.  Emanuel Cleaver, Democrat, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, who was sitting in the Speaker's chair for the dispute, didn't want to be a part of it when it became clear Pelosi was going to lose via a ruling by the House parliamentarian over whether her comments would be allowed.  As Cleaver stormed off the floor, several Democratic members could be heard gasping.  Others turned to each other with confused looks.  Quote, this whole day, we haven't gotten anything for the American public, Cleaver later told reporters.  And at the center of this is just one man.  All this based on one man's words.  Well, without going into greater context, I want to give my personal respect to Cleaver because that's spot on.  This is what the Democrats do.  Trump says naughty words on Twitter, and this is what they do.  Nothing was done for the American people.  Yes, Trump is worthy of some of this blame.  I criticize him.  I do not.  I do not appreciate his tweets, but I can certainly respect his strategy.  OK, and I don't mean respect in a positive light.  I mean, the man knew what he was doing and it worked.  Vox comes out with a story saying Trump is trying to force the Democrats to unify on purpose.  And now look at what's happening.  Not only has a fight reignited between Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Cleaver here now.  I don't wanna necessarily frame it that way, but Cleaver storms out saying nothing's getting done.  So they're back to being in disarray.  But they've also.  now, not only are the Democrats fighting each other, but now the four far left Democrats are front and center.  One of the biggest criticisms of Trump's tweets was that the Democrats were fighting and people said, just let them fight.  They look terrible.  And when Trump tweeted, they unified.  Now, I criticize that, as did many others, and I failed to realize what Trump's true play here was.  He wants the far left front and center.  Think about the outcome of Trump's plan now.  Not only is the far left front and center, but the Democrats are still fighting and they look ridiculous, bickering over whether or not to denounce Trump's tweets instead of actually doing something for the American people.  Trump played, you know, I said the other day he played the media like a fiddle.  He played them for fools.  But it is even beyond what I could have imagined.  I'm shocked to see this story.  They take the bait every single time.  They take his bait and it works.  We know Trump does this.  We know when Trump got elected, people were saying he played the media and got $5 billion in free press.  You know, look, man, people want to claim that Trump is an idiot.  He is not an idiot.  He may be, um, He may shoot, how do I, impulsive, perhaps, impulsive, maybe a bit boorish, but not stupid by no means.  I'm sitting here and I, you know, I pride myself as being a person of, I don't want to say the smartest person in the world, but I think I'm clever, right?  I study, I read, I play mind games and strategy games to try and keep myself sharp.  And I couldn't see this coming.  All I saw were Trump's tweets.  I was played.  I said, oh, here goes Trump mouthing off again.  And now look where we are.  This is this is I'm.  I'm flabbergasted, to say the least.  Let's let's let's read more about what they say.  Democrats then scrambled to find someone to take Cleaver's place.  Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, several of whom were on the floor for the debate, refused, not wanting to be the one to strike the speaker's comments.  Rep.  GK Butterfield, a Democrat, a former CBC chairman, briefly stepped in, followed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who read a parliamentary ruling when announcing that Pelosi's comments were out of order.  When asked whether Cleaver's abandonment of the chair was unprecedented, Hoyer said, I've not seen this before.  There was a lengthy delay after Collins' request, during which leadership on both sides of the aisle, the parliamentarian and various members involved in the debate consulted.  That led to Hoyer's announcement and a party line vote.  That vote allowed Pelosi's remarks to remain in the congressional record as part of the official debate, even though members still can't call Trump a racist on the floor.  Afterward, Collins said the House prizes decorum and he hopes we recover that confidence soon and more forward with respect for the American people who sent elected officials, including the president, to represent them in Washington.  Pelosi, however, remained defiant.  I stand by my statement, Pelosi told reporters as she walked back onto the House floor.  I'm proud of the attention that is being called to it because what the president said is completely inappropriate against our colleagues.  Well, congratulations, Nancy.  The Democrats look crazy.  They're fighting.  People are storming out of meetings.  You're propping up the far left.  The Axios poll shows us whatever your crit.  look as reclined, criticize it.  Of course, they're going to try to criticize it, but let's be real.  People don't like AOC and Ilhan Omar.  Certainly a lot of people do like them, but they are contentious.  They're controversial figures.  Okay.  While some people really like them, a lot of people really, really don't like them.  And that's what Trump wants.  He wants them front and center.  And you did it.  I want to point out a couple funny things here.  This tweet from Yashar Ali.  Nancy Pelosi said, in this house, we speak truth to power, to which Yashar responded, isn't the woman third in line to the presidency and with the singular ability to start an impeachment inquiry technically the power?  Yes, Nancy Pelosi is.  And what is she doing?  She is falling for the bait.  She is playing right into the hands of Donald Trump.  And what, so let's talk about why Donald Trump wants them to be front and center.  Well, there's a story, this story from this morning.  You may ask, outside of the squad being less than favorable, are there examples we can look at that show why they're so unfavorable?  And yes, we have this post from Mediaite.  Watch, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib blame Speaker Pelosi for attacks and death threats.  Progressive Democrat members of the squad laid varying degrees of blame for attacks and death threats at Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's feet during the group's first interview since Trump's racist tweets.  They implied that Nancy Pelosi was racist because she was singling them out.  You can't even criticize these people without being called racist.  That's the game they play.  And Trump wants Nancy Pelosi playing that game all day and night.  So look where Nancy is now.  She's being accused of bigotry, of essentially provoking death threats against these people.  And then she steps up to defend them, looking weak.  He's put her in an untenable situation.  There is nothing Nancy Pelosi can do to come out of this on top.  And he played it perfectly.  He even defended Nancy Pelosi, saying, of course she's not racist.  Now Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, is being slammed by the progressives, defended by the president, and now she's attacking the president.  It is complete chaos.  And what's the point?  Trump's base is not going to abandon him over this.  They're laughing.  They're laughing all the way to the ballot box.  They love what he does.  They love that he's playing these games.  On the left, they're attacking themselves.  They're in a circular firing squad and Trump's spinning around in circles.  The story says, on Wednesday morning, CBS aired Gayle King's extensive interview with Ocasio-Cortez, the squad, you know, you know, they are.  Toward the end of the interview, King asked the group if there existed a fracture between the squad and Speaker Pelosi.  I don't feel a fracture, Rep.  Omar said, and AOC agreed, saying, I don't, I don't.  I think that just as there are members of Congress that did not vote for the Speaker on the House floor on the day of our swearing in, just as there are members who challenge her conclusions, who disagree with her, so do we from time to time.  But that does not mean that there is a fundamental fracture or a dehumanizing going on within our caucus.  When you say things like the Speaker of the House is being disrespectful to women of the color, is she, according to you, being disrespectful to women of color because of your color or because she doesn't like your policies or the tactics that you are all taking to make your point?  King asked.  Right.  And I'll clarify.  I did not say that she was disrespectful of women of color.  Ocasio-Cortez said, but adds, I found some of the comments disrespectful, and that was my personal opinion.  And I did feel that singling out on the basis of one vote was creating an opening.  But the important part of the story comes from Rashida Tlaib.  When she says that she is Speaker of the House, she can ask for a meeting to sit down with us for clarification.  The fact of the knowledge is, and I've done racial justice work in our country for a long time, acknowledge the fact that we are women of color.  So when you do single us out, be aware of that and what you're doing, especially because some of us are getting death threats, because some of us are being singled out in many ways because of our backgrounds, because of our experiences and so forth.  What did she say right there?  Well, it's very simple.  You cannot criticize them for their wrongdoing because they will get death threats because of it.  Think about that.  When they do something wrong, they get singled out, right?  If someone else does something wrong, you criticize them for it.  I will criticize them all day and night.  I don't care if what the color of your skin is.  If you're worthy of criticism, you will get it because I'm an equal opportunity critic.  I will give you praise when praise is due.  But this idea that you can't criticize them because they're women of color is absurd.  And that's what Trump wants front and center.  He wants to keep putting them in front for several reasons.  For one, people don't like them, like I mentioned.  But more importantly, no matter what they do, they use the identitarian card against the Democrats, causing serious problems.  What would any other Democrat do?  They would apologize.  They'd keep it under wraps.  But these people are above criticism because you're a bigot if you criticize them.  And now we can see what may be one of the funniest developments for the Democratic Party.  And I don't mean this to be disrespectful, but we have this story that I will end off on.  So let me wrap up everything we've seen so far in that last segment before I get into this one.  Donald Trump has played the media and the Democrats and they're falling into disarray.  It's incredible.  It's like he pulled up, it's like a gender tower and he pulled out that block and the whole tower came crumbling down.  Again, I'll stress, I didn't see it.  I didn't.  And now I can see the damage he's caused the Democrats with his tweets.  While Trump does look bad to a lot of people over what he said, it doesn't matter.  Trump's base doesn't care.  They don't.  They're going to support him through this.  You cannot insult the man.  There's been smear after smear against Trump.  He's been called every name in the book.  And his approval rating is higher now than it's been in the past two years.  Trump knows the smears don't work.  So he knows he can send you into disarray by finding that attack vector.  And there it is.  So Trump, he's played them, plain and simple.  And it's, I'll say it for the last time, it's probably worked better than he would have imagined.  But now let's take a look at this last little tidbit that I think is actually quite funny.  Marianne Williamson is now polling ahead of Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand in New Hampshire.  New Hampshire primary voters don't care for any of these Democrats.  We can see that Marianne Williamson is actually pulling ahead.  It's impressive, but it shows us something about the Democrats.  They're fractured.  You've got these personalities that are running that no one cares about.  And to me, While I mean no disrespect to Marianne Williamson, I think she's a very lovely individual.  We can see that in the end, the Democrats are all over the place, completely all over the place.  And what's going to happen, I don't know.  But I will say this.  Trump knows how to push their buttons perfectly.  And it works, period.  And there you have it.  So I'm going to wrap up there.  This one has been kind of all over the place because I've had some distractions and some, you may have noticed the jump cuts, but it is what it is.  Stick around.  The next segment will be at youtube.com.  slash timcastnews starting at 6 p.m Thanks for hanging out, and I will see you all next time. ",
