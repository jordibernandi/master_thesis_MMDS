            "text": "She was made of stars, the moon, the sunsets of the world, courage, intuition, and inner strength.  She spent her days chasing sunsets and shooting stars, following the moon and sunlight to the end of the earth to better understand herself and her journey.  She followed the cosmos to guide her soul, yet at times she forgot she was a wild star on her own.  Who was she?  The world always tried to know.  No one knew her secrets, just like a chameleon transforming into so many different versions, adapting to each circumstance.  She had a fire burning at the core of her soul.  She hated playing by the rules of the world.  It made her feel weak and out of control.  She didn't mind being out of control, but only on her terms.  She felt like anything else was eating at her soul.  She stood fearful, yet fearless.  Vulnerable, yet guarded.  Powerless, yet powerful.  She never played on the safe side of life.  She wanted more.  She wanted everything.  And you more awaited her in the unseen past.  She would cross the wildest bodies of water just to find the answers that are burning at her core.  She would have to leave behind the baggage and the burden that's been stabbing at her soul.  It's the only way she could survive, strive, and be free.  Free of circumstance that's been holding her back.  To let go of her past and start a new path.  Yet it's hard for her to let go of people, not things.  She knew her soul belonged to no one, and yet to the world she cared so strongly for.  She was a kindred spirit, a rare soul.  you only come across once in a lifetime if the circumstance was right.  She awaited for answers for a lifetime, it seemed.  The timing to be right.  And on that night, as she cried herself to sleep, she questioned if she was ready to leave it all behind and open the doors she's been so longing for.  Fear fought her through and hard.  But she was made of stars who went over darkness every chance they got.  When she woke up the next morning, she knew the time was now.  With tears of joy, she finally let go and opened the pathway to the door that she's been so longing for.  it's her time to be free to have blind faith to let her intuition god the universe the cosmos to guide her way.  she was destined to chase sunsets mountain peak crystal clear ocean water because they consumed her.  she was what you called a beautiful mess but she was perfect for those who crossed her path And one day she'll look back and realize how far she's gone.  She was me.  She was you.  She was everything that's burning inside of you.  Longing for answers we can't buy or pay for.  But if we search deep down inside ourselves hard enough, the answers are within us.  All of us.  So follow your inner voice, follow your intuition.  Let the universe guide you into making the right decision to live for you and all that you love.  Because this life is precious and not worth wasting on anyone else. ",
