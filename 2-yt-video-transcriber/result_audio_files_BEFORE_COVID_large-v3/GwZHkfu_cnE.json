It looks to me like they don't want a guy to be a man, as the title of the video suggests, but rather that they want guys to be saddled with this extra economic pressure so that they'll be good, obedient little worker bees.  If they wait until they are already financially secure, the risks of getting fired are lower, so that's no good for employers.  No, boys, you should get married when you're in as economically precarious a position as possible.  That's the way the boss likes it.  Also, the younger you marry, the higher the likelihood of divorce, so early marriage isn't even good for marriage.
