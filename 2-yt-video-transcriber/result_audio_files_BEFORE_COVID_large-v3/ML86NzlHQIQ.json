            "text": "As mind-blowing as the truth about creation is, the most spectacular part of the whole narrative, in my opinion, is the firmament.  It's one of those parts of creation that took an entire day for the Father to create, and it really is one of our best timepieces.  It's a calendar.  It's for signs.  It's for seasons.  It is spectacular.  It is the great expanse, and it's really massive.  It's one of those things that we have nothing to compare it to because it is far larger than the dry land known as Earth.  It goes all the way to the ends of the Earth.  And a question that I've always had in my mind is where does this thing meet the Earth?  What does it sit on?  I think we all have this question.  We're not allowed to explore that far yet.  The Antarctic Treaty doesn't end for another 20 plus years.  So what I want to share with you guys is something I found when I was reading the fourth book of Ezra.  And it has to do with the foundations of the firmament.  And it's really cool.  It's not what I was expecting to find because I was getting near the end of the book when I came across this particular verse.  So, here's the verse.  I'm going to share it with you.  And it says, He has shut the sea in the midst of the waters.  And with His word Has he hanged the earth upon the waters?  He spreads out the heavens like a vault.  Upon the waters has he founded it.  So the firmament and its foundation is the waters.  You have this giant expanse and its foundation is the waters.  And people have all sorts of questions about the firmament, and the stars and how they move and how everything works.  And the firmament actually answers all those questions itself when it comes to lunar eclipses or when it comes to why stars move the way they do.  It's because they are within the firmament and they have the paths they were given at creation.  They could move in any direction.  the Father told them to move, but they only move the way they are told to except for the chief stars that we were told, believe it or not, before Christ, a long time ago, we were told that these stars would leave their orbital paths, the chief stars that we now know as planets.  And we were told that we would lose our understanding of what these things are, and we would take them to be gods, which is why they're all named after gods now.  That's not the exact wording of this, uh, of the, uh, prophecy in Enoch.  I would like to, I'll probably put that on the screen later, but that entire prophecy about these stars came true.  They have been used to give us a rewrite of what is above us because now we think that it is surrounding a ball when in reality it's just like the rooms that you see when you go to a planetarium.  People go there all the time and they look up at this vaulted dome ceiling and they watch how the stars work.  It's just like that, only it's very close to us.  It's not really high.  You see a lot of models where they have it looking like it's way up in the air above Earth.  It's really not that high when you zoom way out.  So the perspective issue comes into effect where you see things moving out of our view.  But since it's founded on the waters, Stars could be dipping down below that horizon and moving into the waters just as they appear to do.  Often the great distances where the firmament actually doesn't meet the earth, it meets the water according to the fourth book of Ezra.  I'm not saying this is all there is to the story.  I'm sure there's more details about this thing and how it moves.  If it moves, is the firmament stationary?  Does it move?  I believe Enoch talks about the firmament moving.  So there's probably some pieces of the puzzle we still don't know.  There definitely is.  That's why I don't spend time making these fancy models and I really do like to listen to what the book of Exodus tells us when it says, you are not to make for yourselves a carved image or any kind of representation of anything in heaven above, on the earth beneath, or in the water below the shoreline.  So a globe would be exactly what this is talking about.  Something that could deceive us about what the earth and creation is like.  It is far more complex of a system than anything our earthly minds could fathom, especially when you start looking into the sheer scale of things.  How much more land is out there?  How big the firmament is?  You look at lightning sprites shooting out of the firmament, the waters below it.  When they just shoot out, things like that that we've never seen with our own eyes because they are usually above storms, but they're so fast.  It takes really high-speed cameras just to capture that footage.  It's not something I could go out and film myself unless I was in a plane above the storm like the people were that filmed it.  But there's a lot of theories in my mind about what the firmament would look like or how it would move and all of that and what properties the water that it's founded on would look like.  but I don't want to get into details sharing that because again I don't want to do what the people who fed us the globe model our whole lives did is deceive anyone or take away from the beauty of creation.  the firmament is there you can look up you can see it yourself.  the only model of earth that I trust is to scale.  it's sort of the Stephen Wright model where one mile equals one mile.  It is to scale.  That's the only model I have that is accurate, is what we can see, what we can prove, and we can see the firmament.  It's been proven that it's there.  It's not just the atmosphere like I thought it was, the clouds and all of that.  The firmament is the great expanse that our Father spent the entire second day of creation making.  for us so that we would be able to see signs and seasons.  and what has happened is mankind has lost their understanding of what it was.  We're starting to figure it out again with the spiritual awakening that is powerful.  I have seen so many beautiful stories of people coming back to the Father or getting to know Him for the first time and it's really a cool perspective especially if you don't have any religious background at all, and you can just start with a clean slate and find out who he is without any bias or preconceived notions.  Because me personally, even though I grew up in what's known as the Bible Belt, I really didn't know or have a clue how great he really was until he reached down, picked me up, healed me, and showed me a love that I did not expect.  So it's there.  It's real.  It's greater than anything I can put into words.  That's why they call it joy unspeakable.  And it's the Holy Spirit and the way he allows us to experience his presence is something that's better than anything this earth has to offer.  And it's just a small taste of what's to come.  What's to come is far greater.  And we, with our minds, cannot imagine it.  The word tells us that.  And it's true.  So I want all of you to experience that if you have not yet.  Whatever is holding you back, if you do not speak to him because you think, oh, I'm so unworthy, he wouldn't want to hear me because I am addicted to something on the internet or a truck or whatever it is, don't waste any more time.  Don't condemn yourself.  Try.  Give him a try.  You know, go out there and speak to him.  We're never going to be worthy enough to see him or speak to him no matter what we do anyways.  So quit procrastinating with that.  Give him a shot.  I'm telling you from experience, so much time is wasted while we just condemn ourselves and we're waiting on ourselves to just become perfect enough to talk to him.  It's not going to happen.  Go speak to him.  He will set you free from those addictions so that you won't be a slave to your flesh anymore, which is another gift that you all can experience as well.  It's something that is really awesome to be set free from because you don't realize you're a slave.  And that's probably one of the worst types of slave because you're kind of happy in just being a slave to your flesh and the different things and not even knowing you are.  So I hope that you guys, especially those who have been set free, will pray for those still in bondage to be set free.  Pray for your enemy like we talked about in our last video with my brother who's brought about some really good points and opened my eyes to some things, the tricks of the enemy.  Um, before I get off here though, reminder, I will be going Monday, I believe, Monday, coming up this Monday, to New Zealand and then to Australia.  I will have the information of when to meet up and where in the description.  And you can also check out our video where I show you, you know, exactly where it is.  I will leave that linked in the description as well.  That adventure is coming up.  I look forward to it and I thank you all for your prayers and support as we do stuff like this.  And hopefully get to meet some of you all.  I know the Father's hand has been in this adventure the entire time.  And it's so awesome to see and experience that through getting to know you guys, seeing your testimonies, and just how much glory He receives in all of this.  It's something beautiful.  So share the truth.  I love you guys.  The Father loves you.  As always, you are a beloved creation of the Most High. ",
