That tells great stories, what happened, and Jewish heroes fighting against the Greeks who were trying to bring all the Jewish people into idolatry and sin, and what happened to them?  So where is Maccabees?  Well, let's take a look at an important verse about inspiration.  Paul wrote this to Timothy, as he was explaining about the inspiration of the scriptures, specifically about the Old Testament, 2 Timothy 3, verse 16.  This is what Paul said.  All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof.  for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that the man of God, the teacher, the leader, may be thoroughly equipped.  So we recognize that God's Word, that we call Scripture, is uniquely breathed out by Him, uniquely inspired by Him, and therefore plays a unique part in being part of what we call the Bible.  So what happened to, say, 1 Maccabees, for example?  There are several Maccabees books.  What happened to 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees?  What happened to these books?  Well, what happened was when the Hebrew Bible was being translated into Greek for the use of Greek-speaking Jews a couple hundred years before the time of Jesus, say 1 Maccabees, that was one of the books that was in there.  or Ecclesiasticus, Bensira, that was a book that was in there, or the Prayer of Manasseh, that was a book that was in there, or Tobit, that was a book that was in there, but these were not part of the Hebrew Bible, rather these now existed in Greek, either written in Greek originally like Maccabees, or translated into Greek like Ecclesiasticus.  And what happened was this was now part of what was read by the Greek-speaking church, but the Jewish community as a whole, when they decided what the canon of Scripture was, they didn't have those other Greek books in.  They had the books that were written originally in Hebrew, some in Aramaic.  That to them was the Bible.  called Tanakh, Torah Nevi'im Ketuvim, which is Torah, prophets, and writings.  And then when we look in the New Testament, we see that books like Maccabees or Tobit or Ecclesiasticus, none of these are actually quoted as scripture, whereas other books from the Old Testament were.  So what we recognize is Maccabees gives us really important history and some excellent inspirational lessons and tells us what happened between the old testament and the new testament but it is not actually part of the bible.  so by all means read it learn from it find it edifying but don't base doctrine on it or look at it as being inspired on the same level that scripture was inspired.  so useful helpful edifying absolutely yes.  part of the bible sorry no.
