            "text": "Hey, this is John Hotchkiss.  I'm the host of Be Less Stupid.  And the reason that I'm wearing this hat is because behind me is Donald Trump's national golf course in Palos Verdes, California.  And I came to do a little undercover investigation.  And I don't want anyone inside to suspect that I'm actually a liberal journalist undercover.  Come on, let's go.  Welcome to Be Less Stupid, I'm the host, John Hotchkiss.  I gotta say, I wasn't sure what to expect when I arrived at the Trump National Golf Club.  Were they gonna welcome me?  Or did they have my picture up in the lobby with a note that said, keep the fuck out?  You see, this wasn't the first time that I've gone undercover to a Trump thing.  Before the midterms, I put on a MAGA hat a bunch of times in order to hang around his supporters.  At a gay bondage bar in West Hollywood.  I'm kidding.  It was in North Hollywood.  Okay, look.  It was at a bunch of Trump rallies across America.  I thought that if I looked like one of them, they'd open up and tell me why they still supported him, which is what I was there to find out.  The first rally that I went to, the video I made about the crowd size went viral and got more than 15 million views on Facebook and YouTube.  Another time I shot a Democrat.  get out the vote video from inside a Trump rally.  That one went viral too.  On another occasion, I went undercover at a Sean Spicer book party.  the Q&A, I stood up, I asked Spicer about Russia, and suddenly a security guard raced up the aisle.  He hit me like a tackling dummy, grabbed me around the waist, and carried me on his shoulder out of the ballroom.  He tossed me down some stairs, frog-marched me through the parking lot, threatened me with a hazer, and then flew me off the property. ",

Anyway, that's what happened.  I asked a question right after.  they said, why can't we all just get along?  And it would be good if we could get along.  Only that wasn't what they were interested in.  I raised my hand.  I asked a question very gently.  And I was muscled out of the facility.  Tell me your name. ",

            "text": "Okay, so back to Trump's golf course.  After parking my car, I walked onto the property, which was eerily empty.  There were so few golfers and Trump supporters around, I figured that someone nearby must have been having a book-burning party.  After a bit of checking out the place, I thought I heard someone behind me.  Maybe one of Trump's goons.  So I had to take off.  I ran along this ocean path.  You see, Trump's course is adjacent to a nature preserve.  And some of the park's paths cross Trump's property.  Next, I raced up the stairs of the clubhouse.  Figured I'd lose the goons inside.  Then, I ducked into the bathroom.  Once I finished, I snuck around, ran to a dark, narrow staircase that led upstairs to the lobby.  Turns out, Trump National Golf Club is a public course, and anyone is welcome inside, regardless of who you voted for.  Moving on!  If you're a regular viewer of this channel, you know that in the last video, I went to the Trump Tower Hotel in Las Vegas to find out if Trump really cared about American workers when he was just a con man real estate developer.  In my room, I checked out the label on every item to see where it was made.  No surprise, most of the stuff was made in China.  If you want to see that video, by the way, I put a link down in the description.  That said, when I was done editing, I had a new question, actually.  What if all that stuff from China was just an aberration?  So to make sure, I went to the Trump National Golf Course to find out where all the stuff there was made.  If Trump really cared about American workers, I'd find all sorts of things at the golf course that were made in the USA.  All right, so here we go.  The first thing I checked was the humidor in the lobby.  Surely Donald Trump thinks of himself as a sort of Marlboro Man of Washington, rugged, independent.  Only instead of his teeth being orange from years of cigar smoke, It's his skin.  Turns out these Macanudos, Magnums, Gurkhas, and Romeo and Juliettes are from Honduras and the Dominican Republic.  These Padrones and Monte Cristos are from Nicaragua.  Trump cared about American workers.  His humidor at his golf course would offer the Grand Habano, Don Pepin, and Ernesto Padillas.  Those cigars are hand-rolled the old-fashioned way in Miami, Florida, made from the finest U.S.-grown tobacco.  Then, after the lobby, I decided to go and check this stuff in Trump's golf store.  Surely an American as great as Donald Trump who supports American workers has filled his store with goods made by honest and decent hardworking men and women from America's heartland.  Turns out all these shirts are made in China.  All these hats, they are from China too.  This jacket is from Cambodia.  All these shirts are from Vietnam.  And this pullover is made in India.  Look, clearly this isn't Trump's fault, right?  I mean, everyone knows that there are no apparel companies that make golf accessories that are entirely from the U.S I'm being told that is 100% incorrect, but there are lots of US-based companies making golf clothing.  For example, there's one called Golf in Adelphi, New Jersey, whose elite collection of golf shirts are made entirely in the US from fabrics made in the US.  Diamond is another US-based company that's a family-owned apparel manufacturer in North Carolina.  They make high-quality golf shirts from cotton grown in the US.  Okay, so look, the clothes are made mostly in China, but surely the clubs, I mean the clubs, they're made in the good old US of A, right?  Because Trump is all about. ",
