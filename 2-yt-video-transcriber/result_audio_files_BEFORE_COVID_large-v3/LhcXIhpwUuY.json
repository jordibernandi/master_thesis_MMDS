            "text": "Hey, what's going on guys?  James Madison Otis here.  We're in Ocala today and actually at the PD.  They've got kind of a weird setup here.  It's like a little bit of a retail shop section and then yeah, we're here.  So Ocala PD just recently did not respect some Second Amendment rights with a couple of individuals and I decided to come down here and check them out.  So that's what we're doing right now.  We're going to go in and see if we can't give them a deposit.  Yes, that's a diaper full of poop.  I'm actually going to leave it here.  All right, driving when it was closed.  Obviously it is.  And this is where you come and pick up records, apparently.  We've got their cam back.  They kind of have cameras everywhere to watch us.  No smoking or vaping within 25 feet of the building?  Okay.  That's legal.  Florida Clean Indoor Air Act says it is legal to say that.  And I would throw this in here, but... No food, drink, or tobacco products allowed.  Amazing.  Oh, there it is.  Hello, sir.  How's it going?  Is there something I can do for you?  Yeah, I was going to see if I can get a complaint form for an officer.  Complaint form?  Yeah.  Sure.  So they're up there on their pedestal.  This is a kind of unique setup here.  Got some guns up top.  Would you like to speak to a supervisor?  No, I'd rather not.  It would be easier.  Sir, can you not record people's names?  Okay, what's your name?  Rossi?  My name is Officer Rossi.  All right, Officer Rossi.  These are other people that have been in the building.  Oh, wow.  That aren't actually employees here.  So I'd like to make a public records request with you then.  With me?  I want a copy of that log right there.  You'd have to make a public record request with our records department.  Actually, Florida Statute 119 says that whoever receives it can forward it on, Officer Rossi.  Okay, I will get a hold of my supervisor for you.  You sure will.  That complaint form's for you now.  How long have you been here?  About three weeks?  No, sir.  I'm going to get a supervisor for you right now.  He does have two pins, a pistol.  Probably wants to shoot me right now.  That's what they did last week.  They drew down on some people.  Wow.  And also that text that you're doing there to get your supervisor, retain that too, because I'm doing a public records request for it.  I'm not sending a text message.  OK.  That complaint form, do you have it yet?  I'll be getting it for you in just a second.  Awesome.  Hello?  Yeah.  No, I was actually calling you to have you come out to the main lobby, please.  I do.  There was a citizen in here requesting a complaint form, and he's also making a public records request, and he would like to speak to a supervisor at this point.  I don't want to speak to a supervisor.  I'm sorry?  No, I don't know.  I don't believe so.  Okay.  Is that Eads here right now?  Or Summer?  Okay, I'll call him.  .  .  Aiden, sir, are you at the police department?  Okay.  Can you come up to the lobby, please?  Speak to the censor.  I call them.  I call Freedy's working on something right now.  He's looking for somebody that, a public, public records request, anything like that.  Okay, excuse me.  You got the internet there?  Just type in Florida Statutes 119 and read it.  Because when you violate it, You guys hear from me?  Hi.  I just want to educate Officer Rossi here, or Slob, or whatever his name is.  I just want to see the visitor log.  There's a public records request up there.  The visitor log?  The visitor log.  Yeah, he snatched it from me when I was taking a look at it.  So, he doesn't understand what Florida Statute 119 is, apparently.  I didn't come in here.  I was just looking at it.  It was open in the public, and he was looking at it, and he decided to snatch it from me.  So I do need a complaint from her if you have that.  I mean, if they're there, you can inspect it.  It's readily available.  It's not hard to do, so.  That's it.  See how easy that was?  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  Are you guys still doing, like, drawing down on people awfully carrying firearms at all?  Not when they're going fishing.  They did last, what, two weeks ago?  Oh, yeah.  I was there.  Yeah.  Yeah, about two weeks ago they did it.  A lot of them don't know about the statue.  It's so sad.  You know, the sad part about it is it's in the statue that lets you guys carry a rifle.  And then when I went to police school, because I did, I retired.  I did that, man.  Where'd you work at?  Don't say it.  Down south?  Somewhere.  Did I work for Broward County?  No, I'm out of state.  But they taught us, well, not out of state, but I worked here in state.  But yeah, they taught us the statue right off the bat in rookie school, so.  Yeah, that'd be awesome.  I mean, we're not against you guys.  I don't get it.  I mean, this isn't confidential information right up here, but I asked him if he's been here for a little bit.  So this is only the first page.  All right, sweet.  It's a three page form.  Yeah, unfortunately, I had about 10 years law enforcement experience, and a lot of times the disconnect between the public and police is pretty bad.  And we found it here with Officer Rossi.  So just to let you know, Officer Rossi, just in case you weren't aware of it, pretty much anything that's an official record... Pretty much anything that's an official record for the police department, like, for instance, this log here.  Even photos on your cell phone that you take while you're in the official course of your duty, text messages and all that, they're subject to public records.  Sure.  But there's also a procedure for getting them.  It is their procedure.  It's coming in here in this lobby and saying I'd like to make a public rights request.  Correct.  And for me, I get in touch with the supervisor so that they can determine that process.  And if it's readily available like it was here, that any government agency or something like that should not snatch it from me and pull it away from me and just be like that.  But that's it, yeah.  We got pretty much everything I need here, I believe.  And I think I'm pretty good.  complaint form here with these guys right here.  Not too bad.  The only thing we had issues with is the Florida statutes.  These five or six pages.  when you bring these back in they're gonna want you to sign them and do this here because the Florida statute about about eight years ago allows for law enforcement officers to actually take action and sue you if you do a file a false complaint there.  That's it.  So we have a Lieutenant.  We have Officer Ross.  We have a Lieutenant who?  Eads.  Eads?  Eads, yeah.  Eads.  Eat?  E-A-D-S.  E-A-D-S.  And the Sergeant over here, what's his name, sir?  Rigetti.  Rigetti.  So we're going to do that.  We're going to take a look around, see if they have any issues with that, like there.  And that, I think, I appreciate this is it.  I got the public records I needed right there.  I told him about pictures and cell phones on his, or pictures and texts on his cell phones.  I may request those, so don't delete them.  If you delete them, it turns into, I think, a misdemeanor, so... Okay, and you had a question about an open carry incident that happened a couple weeks ago?  Oh yeah, I think a couple guys were drawn down by the park walking to it, so.  Yes, that was not the Ocala Police Department.  I think everybody was there.  No, the Sheriff's Office, the units that were there, the OPD went after the fact to assist.  I see, assist, okay.  Yes, it was an OPD.  So yeah, I think you've had enough of that.  And they had an event today with no issues with it.  Yeah, we were there.  Everybody was cool with it.  The only thing that we did have is one of the staff there.  We have a cover that goes on the firearm that conceals it.  It's just a cover.  And he says, you can't come in here open carrying.  But then one of the officers came over and said, no, you can come in.  He checked his concealed weapons permit and did that.  It was pretty good.  Thank you, guys.  All right, so take a peek around here.  Oh man, look at that.  Shot there and broke the tip off the star.  Anyway, we're going to go ahead and take a look around and see if they've got anything else.  Those guys were pretty good there.  Officer, the desk officer.  Maybe that's why he's a desk officer.  I'm not sure, but we got our public records.  That's it.  I just want to take a look at it.  There we go.  Holly Havens.  we're gonna go check around that back see where they pull in park in and we'll be out of here information.  is that a screen?  that's a print.  all right guys all right we're gonna head out.  uh thanks for watching like and subscribe and hit that bell button.  sorry it's been a while since i've been on.  i have been swamped with work i mean just inundated.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  So like I was saying, such a weird location.  It's like this is an old retail shop.  And it's right next to all the other different shops in here, but still pretty cool.  All right, we're going to get out of here.  I think Officer Rossi or whatever his name is back there learned a little bit.  Sergeant came out and put it out there, and that's pretty awesome.  Maybe he'll learn this time.  He was texting when I was talking about that text that he was there.  It was in the text message, and then he jumped out of it.  So I think he was texting the officer or the sergeant to say, hey, we got a guy in here.  Probably gave him some information, and that was that.  Oh, look at this.  They got their GPSs on here, the Lard.  I've never seen anything.  Oh, there's an omen.  It's like my old ticket book right there.  You can kind of see it.  Oh, I can't see anything because of the reflection.  Oh, well.  Let's see where we're gonna head to.  I think we're gonna head out.  You guys ready to go?  Well, there we go.  That's Ocala PD, like I said, in a weird retail location.  We're going to head out now, head ourselves home.  And I want to thank you guys for liking, subscribing.  See you again soon.  That was kind of a fail. ",
