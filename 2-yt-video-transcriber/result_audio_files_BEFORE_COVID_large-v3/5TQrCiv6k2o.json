            "text": "Right now I'm going to tell you about three world famous celebrities who were also brought up on the Bible as they were growing up.  Number three, Katy Perry.  Katy Perry grew up in a Pentecostal home.  Her parents had their own ministry and to this day her dad still does much preaching.  When Katie was growing up, she used to hand out Christian pamphlets outside Marilyn Manson concerts, telling people to consider God.  However, in an interview regarding her big hit song, I Kissed a Girl, Mary Hudson, her mother, said this, We cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child.  but she knows we strongly disagree with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the Bible clearly states as sin.  Number two, Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence.  Jennifer Lawrence grew up with Christian parents and she specifically remembers praying every single night before she went to bed and going to church.  I grew up very religious.  I have a religious family.  But I don't believe in anything.  But if there is something, I don't believe it identifies as a man.  Number one, actor Brad Pitt.  Well known for his looks, well known for his acting ability, well known for his famous character in Fight Club, Tyler Durden.  Brad Pitt was raised in the Southern Baptist Church.  And as a teenager, he felt very moved when his parents would take him to revival meetings.  Brad Pitt sees a psychic regularly and takes part in meditation and channeling.  Now you tell me, leave it in the comment box below.  What do you think is worse, being an atheist or being involved with all of those channelings?  But here's my question to you.  Are you a celebrity?  I don't think you are, are you?  And neither am I. I'm just an average Joe, if I can use that pun.  But I do wonder if you yourself were brought up on the Bible.  Perhaps your parents took you to church, prayed for you, shared the gospel.  And now as you've got older, you've wandered from that way.  Now you are more interested in the things of the world, the pleasures, the excitement.  And you don't think about that Lord Jesus anymore.  Well today, I don't think it's an accident.  you're listening to this video and I would plead with you this very day to come back to that old rugged cross where Jesus died for sinners.  Commit yourself to him, turn from your sins and put your trust in the one who split time in two and rose from the dead.  Because let's face it, we've all got a grave waiting for us and it is only Jesus who can rescue us and give us eternal life.  Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.  So friends, perhaps today we need to reach out and share the good news with one of our prodigals, one of the people we know who once walked with the Lord but now no longer know him.  God bless you all.  Please do subscribe.  Please do hit the like button.  And thank you for all of your love and care that you've shown to this ministry. ",
