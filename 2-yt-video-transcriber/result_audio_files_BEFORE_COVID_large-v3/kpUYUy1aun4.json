We have 29 million people uninsured in this country.  We have 44 million people who are underinsured, which means they have insurance, but with the gaps and the coverage so big, it's as if they aren't insured at all.  35% of Americans go without needed care due to cost.  I would argue that that is unaffordable. ",
