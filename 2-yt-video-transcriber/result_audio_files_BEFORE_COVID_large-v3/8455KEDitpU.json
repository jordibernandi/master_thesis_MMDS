            "text": "Hello, this is Tony Hiller from RealClimateScience.com, setting the record straight about climate.  It's not an easy job committing fraud on the scale which climate alarmists are, so I thought I'd give them some assistance.  I've developed some new software which will give them a boost in identifying which critical data they should be hiding.  But first, there's some important news out of Washington, D.C.  They've identified a panel of experts who'll be setting our nation's climate policy.  Apparently, the Democrats felt they needed people who were better educated than AOC or Greta.  Now let's review the problem, which my software will help Climate Alarma solve.  This is the main page from the part of the National Climate Assessment which went out to journalists and policy makers.  This page contains a lot of graphics.  Here's one which shows heat waves increasing since 1960.  Here's another one which shows Arctic sea ice declining since 1979.  And another one which shows wildfires increasing since 1983.  And one more which shows sea level rising since 1920.  So we have one graph which starts in 1960, another which starts in 1979, another which starts in 1920, and one more which starts in 1983.  When you want to mislead people with statistics, picking your start date is very important.  First, let's look at the heat wave graph which starts in 1960.  They carefully picked a period during the global cooling scare to start their graph so that they could show heat waves increasing over time.  And here is the underlying data from the part of the National Climate Assessment which didn't go out to journalists and politicians.  This graph is warm spells days, this one is heat wave magnitude, and this one is warmest temperature of the year.  As you can see, summers were much hotter in the United States prior to 1960.  So by hiding all the data before 1960, they were able to show a little bit of an upwards trend.  I overlaid the part of the graph which went out to policymakers over here in this corner on top of the underlying data, and you can see exactly what they did.  The red bars are what policymakers saw, and the extreme heat prior to 1960 is what they didn't see.  People may consider this sort of behavior to be shocking, but it's actually standard operating procedure for climate alarmists.  This graph shows in pink all the data that was hidden from journalists and policymakers.  This next graph is the one which shows wildfires increasing in the U.S.  since 1983.  And this graph of U.S.  forest fires from the U.S.  Forest Service is the one which didn't go out to journalists and politicians.  And you can see why they hid all the data before 1983, because there was a lot more burn acreage in the United States prior to 1983.  Burn acreage in the U.S.  has been down about 80% since the 1930s.  This shouldn't be surprising to anyone because it was very hot and dry during the 1930s.  Fires are associated with heat and drought, so there's very close correlation. ",
