            "text": "good evening ladies and gentlemen.  welcome back to blue ridge silver hound and i'm your host sean.  tonight we're going to talk about the discovery of a third such coin a 1982 lincoln memorial set that you guys will be sure to love.  and this is this is a coin that is on the hearts and minds of coin roll hunters and treasure seekers as they go through their coins.  I'm gonna tell you why this coin is worth so much money here in a moment.  But first of all, I wanted to draw your attention to really big news.  So if you didn't see my post I had earlier or you're new to the channel, I'm gonna give you a little bit of a tidbit at the end of the video.  To let you know that the giveaway that I'm going to be hosting on Father's Day, June 16th, will be a good one.  Want to know more?  Stick around.  Enjoy the information on this 1982 Lincoln set.  And don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell for instant notifications.  That's important because this is a subscriber giveaway.  All right.  So without further ado, I wanted to talk about this 1982 Lincoln Cent that is kind of got a lot of buzz going around it.  It's an extremely rare coin.  It's one in which that, again, it's a cherry pickers guy variety.  It's a coin that is on the top of a lot of hit lists for coin roll hunters.  So it's a really neat coin.  A really neat coin.  And it's got a lot.  It's actually an incredibly dramatic double die.  One in which that, for the longest time, has gone unnoticed.  but was recently discovered a few years ago.  so you never know what you could find in your coin rolls and in pocket change.  new discoveries are being made all the time all the time on a yearly basis.  there are dozens of new varieties that come on the scene.  this one right here has an estimate of three thousand dollars and higher.  how much will it end at?  This one is for sale on GreatCollections.com.  as a coin that a lot of people are watching.  All right.  And before we get started, I wanted to discuss the variance in the date size.  All right.  Because the variety is going to be on a small date.  Lincoln cent on a Philadelphia, you need to know the difference.  Sometimes this could really trick some people.  So I have a graphic here on screen of both a large date, which is on the left, and a small date coin on the right.  Pay extra attention to the size of the numbers, especially the number 8 in both variants.  As you can see on the large date, the 8 is considerably bigger.  It's much more taller in length than the 2, and it looks kind of out of proportion to the 9.  Take a look at the small date.  This one looks a little bit more even.  The top and bottom is exactly the same height as the two sitting right next to it.  If you could draw an imaginary line connecting both the top of the eights to the twos, you will see that the small date the tops and bottoms of the eight and two will be touching with an imaginary line.  it's pretty neat.  so as long as you know the difference okay and you just sit there and kind of scan this image here for a few moments you'll know exactly what to look for.  It takes a little bit of practice, but this is a variety, you know, large date, small date, that you could see real easily with the naked eye.  You don't need a magnifier.  However, the double die, you'll probably want to use a magnifier for this.  I recommend 10 times power or less magnifier.  get an idea of what you're looking for.  so the this is the coin in question that we have here.  this is the one that a collector on coincommunity.com discovered back in february.  all right so the name of the individual that found it on coin community is levels of madness.  madness with one s at the end.  um which found it Was trying to do a little bit of research, came to find out it is one of the most sought after double die varieties that you could find in the Lincoln cent series, especially the more modern dated coins.  Now take a look at the reverse of the coin, okay?  Because this is where all the action is on this one.  And it is truly unmistakable, one of the craziest doubled die rotations that you'll ever see on a semi-modern Lincoln cent, okay?  Between this one and the 1983 double die reverse, I mean, they are two extremely notable varieties, okay?  Both in which sell for a lot of money.  However, this 1982 small date, and keep in mind, this is going to be the zinc coin.  This is a copper coated zinc coin, not the bronze.  This variety right here, third one to ever been found and graded.  So this one right here, again, is on Great Collections.  Let me fill you in a little bit on what the grade is.  Okay, so it did grade PCGS Mid-State 62 Red.  Now the coin obviously has been in circulation.  It's got some of those splotches.  I don't know how it got a red designation.  It looks probably red-brown, and I'm surprised it graded cleanly.  But I'm willing to bet the graders gave a little extra leeway on this coin because it is one of the modern rarities in Lincoln Penny collecting.  This one right here is designated as DDRFS1801 in the Cherry Pickers Guide.  Again, it's the small date.  zinc, copper coated zinc, double die reverse.  You see strong doubling in not only E Pluribus Unum, the motto, which is the main diagnostic point, but also in the United States of America and to a lesser extent on one cent.  So as you're going through your Lincoln pennies and you're pulling out all of the zinc small dated Philadelphia's in the 1982 date, you want to take extra, extra precaution that you are flipping the coin over and looking to see if you have one of these rare varieties.  Now tentatively, the starting bid on this coin through Great Collections is $3,000.  I have a feeling that this one is going to sell in excess of that.  The last example, let's see if I can find it right here.  I'm not even sure there's ever been an example that has sold.  But this is a coin right here, again, that is not going to be cheap to own by any stretch.  Let's see here.  Alright, well it looks like none of them has sold.  There hasn't been an example that has sold as of yet, which is interesting.  Which can make this coin worth a lot more money.  So keep an eye out on this one.  It's on Great Collections.  It ends on Sunday.  So this is going to be one that ends later this week.  And it's going to be an important find.
