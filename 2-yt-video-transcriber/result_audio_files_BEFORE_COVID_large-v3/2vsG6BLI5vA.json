            "text": "How's it, guys?  Nate here on the road in Rodanthe, North Carolina, which is a big part of the Outer Banks, getting to do a road trip with my sister in her 2019 4Runner Limited 4x4, which is a little exciting for me because I actually have my TRD Pro and just wanted to see some of the differences.  So I'm going to talk about that.  Obviously, right off the bat, you guys know that the Limited 4Runner Has a lot more chrome trim on the inside, outside.  Not really the inside, I guess more the outside.  This has this really nice wood leather.  And, you know, most of the appearance, you know, with the grills are the big-time differences.  You've seen SR5, the TRD Off-Road Pro, and the Limited, and that was the price point as well.  But it has the JBL system, which I've been actually really impressed with, comparably to my 16 Pro, which does not have the JBL, which was introduced this year, 2019, and And of course, the 20s as well, sunroof.  One thing I'm pretty stoked about this one is it has the, you know, the cooled leather seats, which the Pro does not.  And it does make a difference.  I like that option.  One thing that this, that has the dual climate control on this as well, but with the settings of your vent, I like the SR5 and the TRD ones a little better because you can adjust where you want the height.  If you want it more in the upper fan and the leg, you can dial it in incrementally.  This one is really just a 50-50 split.  So you say you want to have most of your air going to the upper vents and just a little bit to your feet.  You can do that with the SR5 and the TRDs, but you can't with the Limited.  It's here like, why did they do that?  I don't like this button style on the Limited as well.  What else?  The, I thought this was gonna ride stiff because of 20 inch wheels, but it actually rides really nice.  I think that has something to do with the X-Ray of suspension and the shocks and whatnot.  If you guys know anything about the X-Ray, it's like hydraulic shock absorbers.  And I had it on my 08 4Runner.  I had a Sport Edition that had the X-Ray.  So it actually rode really nice.  And I'm actually really impressed with the ride quality of this truck.  I believe it's full-time four-wheel drive.  I noticed that her miles per gallon was only 15 miles per gallon.  She lives in Charlotte.  She said her commute isn't that.  She drives like two miles to work.  She does mostly city, but 15 miles a gallon is pretty bad.  I think she has full-time four-wheel drive.  I'm looking at the selector switch here on the 4x4.  I think that's part of it.  Yeah, it has to be full-time four-wheel drive.  There's no way that I could drive on the sand without a full-time four-wheel drive.  Straight from the pavement to the sand.  Works good.  One thing I really like about the Limited, though, is it has a lot more interior lighting and undercarriage lighting, which I don't know if that came from factory or it was added.  When she got the truck, she said she bought it with like 5,000 miles on it.  The gauges, everything is near identical.  They still have the blind spot monitoring.  Most of the safety stuff is not in here at all.  That just got introduced in the 2020 4Runners.  This one does have the key fob.

A lot of my jobs don't call for it, so I'm super stoked.  Been surfing a lot on my trip here on the Outer Banks.  This is the smallest day so far.  Fun, playful.  Chest eye.  Light out.  Check out the footage.  There she is.  Buxton, Cape Hatteras Lighthouse.  Pretty cool.  You ready, little sister?  I'm ready.  Here we go.  Lights up there.  Cool.  Five minutes on the balcony.  Made it.  Pretty easy.  Wow.  Winds are still blowing.  It used to be over there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can see this was the path.  Or the old parking lot.  Yeah, this was the old path.  They moved it from all the way down to where those cars are way down.  It was like almost 2,600 feet or something like that.  absolutely incredible.  the thing's built in 1870. a modern marvel both inside and out with a staircase brick by brick.  you're like 1870. they built that thing like how with the scaffolding and everything just unreal human ingenuity.  all right we're out of here.
