            "text": "First and foremost, when somebody goes into a bank and they ask for a mortgage and sit down with the mortgage broker, very quickly the mortgage broker will give them the documents that they need to give to a conveyancing solicitor who they engage.  And the conveyancing solicitor will soon sit them down and say, OK, this is a situation.  You have to sign this mortgage deed in order to secure the funds to buy the house.  So if you do that now, it'll all go through.  So they sign on the dotted line and that document is taken by the bank and deposited in a private account and they then pretend to lend that money back to the customer at compound interest for 25 years.  In other words, the mortgage deed that is signed is the credit that's created.  It creates the credit and then that credit they pretend to lend back at compound interest for 25 years.  So the second aspect of it that must be considered is it's actually illegal to sign any mortgage deed to a property that you don't yet own.  And that point was hammered home significantly in a case called Southern Pacific Mortgages in 2015, when in the Supreme Court, the president of the Supreme Court, Lady Hale, ruled that despite the common practice of of the entire conveyancing industry for many years, it was in fact entirely right that nobody has either a legal or equitable right to sign a deed to any property prior to becoming the owner of it.  The third bit is that generally, they're given these deeds to sign and take home, or they're sent the deeds in the post.  And when they receive them, they're told to sign them and send them back.  to the conveyancing solicitor, who then adds a witness to the signature.  But they weren't there at the time and place of execution.  So again, it's another fraud.  On virtually every mortgage deed, the witness was not there at the time it was signed, and they have to be.
