            "text": "This is Richard Wolff with a response to President Trump's State of the Union message, February 5th, 2019.  I'm going to focus on the economics of it because they were, in their way, stunning.  Let's begin with the simplest assertion.  We are doing great economically.  We are in the best shape in the whole world.  Words to that effect.  Let's be clear about some things.  Over the last 20 years, the United States has had a hard time achieving economic growth.  The last year or two are slightly better, parts of them, than the previous ones, and there's no mystery for that.  It's because the government gave an enormous boost to the economy.  Let me say that again.  Not private enterprise, not private capitalist corporations, the government gave an enormous boost.  What was the form of the boost?  The 2017 tax cut in December of that year, which gave corporations a vast amount of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes they don't have to pay anymore, freeing up that money for them to do whatever they want with.  And they mostly used it to increase salaries of executives, to buy back shares of stock in the stock market, all of which was very good for the top 1%, but not for the rest of the American people.  All of that is hidden under the rug by Mr.  Trump.  But even the performance, getting our growth rate up to 3% for part of that time, even though it's averaging out to 2.5% to 3%, that that's the best in the world, that's just a lie.  Let me give you an example simply.  The People's Republic of China.  They're having a bad year.  They're only growing, ready, six and a half percent, which is lower than what they've been able to do for most of the last 15 or 20 years.  The Chinese economy has become the second most important in the world because they systematically grow, you got it, faster than the United States.  The real wages of Chinese workers, the average amount of money they get adjusted for inflation, has quadrupled in the last 12-15 years.  What happened to the average wage in America adjusted for inflation?  It hardly budged.  It went up single digits, not three to four times.  The experience of the economies in these two countries could not be more different.  Excluding that from the conversation, prancing around as if the economy here is the envy of the world, that's not just nonsense.  That's straight-out lying, and it is meant to position himself as the special person.  The second economic reality I would want to talk about is the fact that he spent more time in this State of the Union message demonizing immigrants than on any other topic.  stories of immigrants being bad, stories of invasions coming, wild exaggerations that have no basis in fact.  Let me give you the simplest economics with which to understand that.  The United States is an economy of 325 million people.  The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States is estimated between 10 and 12 million.  Okay, you don't need rocket science to understand that.  nothing that you can do to those poor.  10 to 12 million of the lowest paid people. ",
