            "text": "Most of you are familiar with the Ilhan Omar situation that spiraled out of control because she basically said when confronted, well, why do you think they would try to punish you for critiquing Israel?  She said, initially, it's all about the Benjamins.  Quoting a famous song by P. Diddy, of course.  But by the way, let me just go ahead and clarify this because I think that a lot of people didn't get this.  Listen, it's a little nugget from the black community.  are these things called double entendres?  okay yes she was speaking about the song all about the measurements because of how much uh israeli money influences political outcomes to an even greater degree than what most people may believe.  um it's just.  these are the facts right.  so yeah there was a uh.  the idea that the money by the Israeli government and its lobbyists were influencing politics and politicians to basically disproportionately punish not only Ilhan Omar, because another person gets left out of that discussion is that they threatened Rashida Tlaib as well for nothing other than speaking out against the atrocities of the Israeli government.  They're not.  they're not the only ones, though.  Coincidentally enough, the only other Muslim member in Congress has also received these threats.  Keith Ellison or he was a member of Congress.  So this is this is kind of like one of those situations where you kind of can see what's really being what's really going on.  If you catch my drift, we talked about on several of the videos, but the whole all about the Benjamins thing.  It's called a double entendre, which is the clever part about it that I appreciated and a lot of my friends appreciated, but I think a lot of y'all didn't get it.  She was also talking about Benjamin Netanyahu.  Because the money that obviously it's all about the Benjamins, right?  The money that allows or that demands that politicians do what Israel says is also what is allowing Benjamin Netanyahu to get away with whatever he wants to in Israel.  So it's all about the Benjamins and doing what Benjamin Netanyahu says because it's all about the money that flows in through AIPAC and other Israeli lobbyists.  So let me just clear that up.  I think, because I'm going back and forth with some people in my comment section and some people got it immediately and other people were kind of, they were surprised like, hold up, did everybody else not get that?  Yes, that's double entendre.  So, urban hip hop news for the day.  Anyway, On the on the on the on the other side of that coin was the responses in the lack thereof.  The establishment responses were exactly what you expect them to be.  Right.  Unfortunately, there is no when it comes to attacking.  In silencing the military, anybody who opposes the military industrial complex, and I would say that Israel is definitely, considering a lot of the aid that they get from us is military base, they are definitely one key component and one key pillar of our military industrial complex because they allow us to get and gather intelligence about them in the Middle East that otherwise we would not be able to get or be too difficult to get.  And a lot of times we can actually separate ourselves from some of the actions by Israel that are conducted in the Middle East by Israel, by just funding Israel and letting them do what the hell they want to there.  So even though that's been much more difficult to escape recently, they've automatically tied us together.  So, yeah.  The establishment responded exactly how we expected them to, whenever it's time to come down to anybody who opposed the military-industrial complex.  Both, which is something I talk about often, the right and the left establishment love identity politics.  They love it.  They thrive on the idea of bashing someone or uplifting them.  based solely on identity because oftentimes when it comes to policy.  identity.  identity politics are absent of facts regarding policy.  it's purpose.  okay identity politics is absent of an analysis of character.  okay identity politics is just that you get people really galvanized or you get people really pissed off about the identity of the person that you're critiquing or uplifting.  uh Nobody else is weaponized as better than the Republicans, right?  I mean, let's be honest.  Most Republicans are white.  You know, this is a fact.  You know, it is what it is.  And oftentimes, I don't know if you've ever heard of the Southern strategy.  That's basically what it was, to use a bunch of racist dog whistles where you condemn Black people for basically whatever stereotype that you believe most convenient for Black people, like the welfare queen.  And it turns out that white people are actually on welfare by a wide margin.  I'm not talking about like like the numbers, the raw numbers, of course, there's more white people, but also just statistically, there are a lot more white people on welfare.  Now, but that was the Southern strategy, was to convince people that black people were the cause of their issues outside of the politicians.  And that was started by Republicans.  Now, Democrats have become very good at weaponizing identity as well.  Bill Clinton was no stranger to weaponizing the white identity and demonizing people of color.  Trump, obviously, right?  Hillary Clinton tried to do it with her femininity.  That was kind of non-existent.  Well, that's neither here nor there.  Basically, but she tried it.  So the identity politics, I don't want people to think it's unique to one side.  The outrage culture and social justice warrior nonsense is not, that's also not limited to one side.  Ben Shapiro's a social justice warrior.  He's just a social justice warrior for the right.  Right?  Okay.  Okay.  the Neera Tanden's of the world, or the Dave Pakman's of the world, or the, at times, different, you know, TYT, depending on which segment you're getting and who's on, they can be social justice warriors on the right, or on the left, excuse me.  But both the left and the right, well, on the establishment wing, that champion identity politics will always use identity to attack.  And that's what we saw happen with Ilhan Omar.  With Ilhan Omar, basically she was attacked because she was, like the amount of attacks, the type of attacks she was berated with, my favorite one, and by favorite I mean most disgusting attack, was when Chelsea Clinton came out of literally nowhere.  because who cares what Chelsea Clinton is doing?  Somebody made the mistake of telling Chelsea Clinton that her opinion matters to somebody, who that person is.  They probably haven't been born yet or they died a long time ago because we don't know who the hell cares about Chelsea Clinton's opinion.  But she came out of nowhere and said that, yeah, we must stop our politicians or especially our politicians from being anti-Semitic and making anti-Semitic tropes, which didn't happen.  And then she said signed as an American, which I thought that Ilhan was an American.  I mean, I know she's a Somali refugee.  I know she came from a Kenyan refugee camp.  I know she's been living in Minnesota and, you know, she had to work to get her citizenship and become legal.  But I thought, you know, that's what made America great.  The idea that you can do these things that have landed Ilhan ultimately in the congressional seat, but signed off as an American.  I'm sure that wasn't a dog whistle either.  Just like your mother's super prayer comments.  Wasn't a dog whistle.  So they attacked her in both sides.  She should never have apologized.  I know, I understand why she did it because imagine feeling like you're almost alone in that situation because like I said in another video, there were a lot of people who abandoned her.  But one person did not abandon her.  And this is a response of somebody that we were all kind of waiting to hear.  And that person is Bernard Sanders.  because Ernie Sanders, on a conference call hosted by Jim Zogby, co-chair of the DNC's Ethnic Council, when asked about the controversy over Representative Ilhan Omar's tweets about AIPAC, he said, I talked to Ilhan last night to give her my personal support.  We will stand by our Muslim brothers and sisters.  That's really important to hear.  Let me just say that when it comes to Bernie Sanders' stance, it's often time to take a step back.  Foreign policy, I don't hold my breath much, to be honest with you.  Very lukewarm, right?  He will condemn regime change, but then in my opinion, wrongfully demonize someone where we haven't actually seen the proof.  And the only proof, the little bit of proof that we have comes from numbers that later, numbers or facts that later get proven to be untrue.  And we're just a convenient method for people to start pursuing more defense contracts and going over and committing genocides, right?  Cool.  Get that.  He needs to work on that.  And I hope to see that in the very near future.  And I have hope in that after a couple of the conversations I've recently had.  With that being said, domestically, when it comes to these type of things, Bernie's not a grandstander.  He didn't show out on Twitter like the rest of us.  He didn't go do a video about it like the rest of us.  He took the time out to call her directly and get her understanding of what took place and perhaps even had already made up his mind based off of what he saw.  Because remember Bernie Sanders was the only candidate in the entire election that refused to go and seek AIPAC money, right?  So for him to call and say, I know exactly what you mean.  I know exactly what you're talking about as far as big money in politics.  I know exactly what you mean.  That's what you're saying.  I knew what you meant.  They knew what you meant.  And I stand by you.  Now, here's the other important thing about that.  Saying that we stand beside our Muslim brothers and sisters speaks volumes because this is the this is.  The identity politics, identity politics is bad when it's weaponized, but it can be good when we're talking about something like this because that was a firm condemnation of the xenophobic tropes that we were seeing coming from both the establishment left and the establishment right.  And even scarier, which is the part that will always doom the Democratic Party if they don't get it together, which is when they allow right wing tactics and right wing smears and right wing attacks start governing and dictating their responses to the issues or to other Democratic Party members.  Because that is where basically this all came from, was from smears from Democrats. ",
