Meanwhile, back on the ranch, our president has pulled us out of the JCPOA nuke treaty, imposed sanctions on Iran and tariffs on China, and he abides the regime change meddling in Venezuela and elsewhere.  Is this erratic administration, plus emerging Eurasian collaboration, the perfect storm that can sink the US dollar as the world's preeminent currency and our leadership among nations?  Let's ask RT defense expert, longtime Pentagon official Michael Maloof and Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital.  Welcome both.  And Michael, during the recent G7 meeting, I couldn't resist the temptation.  I muted my TV.  And to me, the body language was very telling.  Is it my imagination or are other world leaders merely tolerating Trump's buffoonery? ",

They see that the United States is going it alone with its America First approach, which is basically controlled by the neoconservatives in this government.  And as a result of using economic warfare through sanctions and tariffs, tariff battles with almost every country in the world these days, they're looking for alternatives.  And we're beginning to see Europe, our Western partners there, beginning to look more eastward as a consequence.  And I think as a result of all of this, and with a benchmark of the Trump administration, as you point out, dropping out of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear agreement in May last year, that really set the tone for an acceleration of getting out from under the dominance of the U.S.  dollar and the Western financial system such as SWIFT and what have you, and looking for alternative approaches.  And what we're seeing here is this acceleration.  We're seeing Russia, China, Iran, Turkey, India, Pakistan, the BRICS countries of Brazil, China, Russia, and even South Africa beginning now.  to look more eastward in this pursuit.  And it's not stopping.  It's accelerating.  And as a result of sanctions that are being put on our European friends, they're looking more eastward as a consequence.  This is beginning to evolve, but it's accelerating more rapidly now. ",

I mean, the real issue for the dollar and what's going to sink the dollar is our own fiscal profligacy.  And these large deficits, budget deficits and trade deficits, were here long before we elected Donald Trump.  Now, he has not done anything about it.  In fact, the deficits are getting bigger, both trade and budget deficits.  What has enabled this over the years has been the world's willingness to hold U.S.  dollars as the primary reserve currency and to continue to loan money to Americans and to the U.S.  government so we can continue to live beyond our means, we can have enormous government programs that we don't pay for, and we can consume all sorts of goods that we don't manufacture.  And we can live in an economy based on consumption and debt without having to save or produce.  The world has done that for us.  And I think this is what's going to come to an end.  I think we're going to see a collapse in the value of the dollar.  And when the dollar does collapse, America's power is going to dissipate.  And Americans are going to have to deal with reality that we've hollowed out our infrastructure.  We've been living above our means.  And there's going to be a day of reckoning for these years of excesses.  Unfortunately, Trump didn't start this, but he may be the fall guy.  Who knows? ",

This is simply giving the world yet another reason to look for an alternative to the US dollar, which they should have been looking for a long time ago.  But now, by flexing muscle that we really shouldn't be flexing, we're in effect biting the hands that have been feeding us.  And now they're questioning whether or not they should continue to do that.  And so we have accelerated the process of the dollar's demise by antagonizing so many of the nations around the world that we really need to continue to hold the dollar.  We keep talking about how, or Trump keeps talking about how, we've got the Chinese over a barrel, and they're somehow in a weaker bargaining position than we are.  But we have far more to lose because the Chinese simply lose a customer that doesn't pay and that they have to vendor finance.  But we lose a banker.  We lose a supplier.  The Chinese have been propping up the US economy.  We have been screwing up the Chinese economy.  Because in order to maintain this relationship, they have pursued reckless monetary policy.  They have inflated bubbles.  They have done things in order to artificially prop up the dollar so they can continue to sell products to people that really can't afford to buy them.  China should be developing trading relationships with countries that can produce the things that the Chinese citizens want so that trade is balanced.  They can't run this enormous trade deficit with the United States or surplus with the United States.  It is screwing up their economy. ",

The Chinese hold a lot of U.S.  dollar denominated debt in addition to the treasury debt.  So it's a lot more than a trillion.  And on the margin, that is a tremendous amount of money.  If we lose Chinese lending, if the Chinese want to unload their dollar denominated debt, President Trump seems to think there's an ample supply of lenders that really want that debt.  I don't believe that they exist.  I don't know that there's that many foolish people out there in the world that want to lend so much money to the U.S.  at such a low rate of interest.  And once the thing turns around, what Trump forgets is that the national debt is not financed with 30-year treasuries.  The majority of it is financed with short-term treasury bills that constantly mature.  We have to roll over this debt all the time.  And if foreigners finally lose confidence in our ability to repay our debts with money that actually has any value, the game is over.  I mean, why do you think gold prices have moved above $1,500?  People are losing confidence in the dollar.  And you can't see it in the foreign exchange markets.  The dollar hasn't really started to fall against other fiat currencies.  But that's because all fiat currencies are falling against gold.  But the strength of gold is showing an underlying weakness in the dollar that the forex markets aren't showing yet, but they will. ",
