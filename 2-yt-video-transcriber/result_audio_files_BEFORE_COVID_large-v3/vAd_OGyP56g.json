You will become a Muslim, right?  After you watch this, you will understand everything.  To me, that's it.  Like, so that's how famous this guy is.  I mean, the audience that this guy has, like some of our biggest politicians in, you know, in the West and in US, for example, like don't enjoy that level of, you know, that big of an audience.  This guy, when he speaks, millions of people are listening to him and to me it says a lot when a Muslim and they give up on you like so some of them just say like oh just read the Quran.  but more people actually tell you to just watch this guy's videos instead of reading the Quran.  right to me sure that shows how how popular this is where their last attempt at converting you is not just sending you a Quran video.  is this guy right?

And that's actually somebody who was watching his videos in Bangladesh in 2016, killed 22 people in a cafe and gave... Dr.  Nayak the credit for it, saying, you know, he moved me to do this.  So he's banned in other countries as well.  And obviously, if you watch a lot of his videos, I do not.  But, you know, a lot of people do say, yeah, his videos do incite hatred.

Sopam is also saying he is banned in India.  Malaysia isn't giving him up to Indian authorities for some reason.  Well, I think that's my guess is Malaysia is not giving him to Indian authorities because, you know, there's a call out for my beheading in Malaysia, right?  Malaysia, there are some really, so there are some, they have an Islamic extremist problem in Malaysia.  And I think that if the government there does decide to give him up to Indian authorities, there might be some really, really angry people the government there has to deal with.  So that might be the reason why they're not giving him up.  uh what's the top comment is saying chapter seven verse six says he has got nothing to do with that.  oh okay no people don't know what the i i don't know if people i don't know if people know what the joke here is because people have to listen to zakir like to know what it.  because every time most of the time when he when he's talking he always say chapter seven i can't do access.  okay but just go listen to him like he's.  he just starts to say chapter seven verse six of the quran says like he memorized the whole quran and every time he just quotes the quran and but so yeah if you want to read this joke properly you have to say it in an accent.  so i can't do that.  i wish valid was.  uh from we do biz was here.  he would Just go watch ViduVids, his channel.  Great impressions of him.  You will understand this joke, okay?  I just ruined the joke by explaining it.  So there's another top comment saying, challenge admin if you listen to his lecture.  Oh, oh, look, this is exactly what we said.  That's one of the comments on the post is a challenge to us, the admin, that if we listen to his lecture, we will too believe in a creator.  This is exactly what we were saying.  It's right here.  Okay, so this proves what we were telling you guys.  So another top comment is saying, where did this money come from?  Brother asks a very good question.  It's so sad because a lot of these jokes will only make sense if you actually listen to this guy.  Okay.  Brother asks a good question.  Okay.  Alright, so let me see what other comments do we have.  John Brown is saying if he's advocating violence against non-Muslims then yes he should be banned.  I don't know, should his videos be banned?  Like, I don't know.  I'm really worried.  I don't like when government says that this... I think he should just get arrested for preaching violence, but I don't know if his videos should get banned.  That's like really authoritarian in my view.  I mean, I don't want any kind of expression to be... I want to be on the side of, you know, allowing all comments out there.  even maybe he should get arrested for expressing violence and like for advocating violence but i don't think the videos should get banned.  i don't i. maybe i'm wrong but i'm open to changing my mind and that but i always try to be on the side of freedom of expression.
