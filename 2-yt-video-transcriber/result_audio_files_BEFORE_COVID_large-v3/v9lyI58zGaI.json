            "text": "These people want to destroy the Irish nation and want the Irish people to support that, to vote for that, to vote for their own displacement.  I think it's quite ironic that we passed here the Fine Gael stand, the Fianna F\u00e1il stand, the main political party stand, and what are they doing?  They're offering Irish farmers, inviting them into their stand to give them a cup of tea.  Here's a free cup of tea, Barry's tea in Fine Gael stand, Lion's tea in the Fianna F\u00e1il stand and people then are supposed to be thankful and grateful that you have parties that are representing their interests when in fact they're betraying them, they're selling them out.  This fund was signed up to the Mercosur region allowing 99,000 tonnes of substandard South American beef.  We cannot adopt a policy of being lapdogs to people who don't care about this country in the European Union.  The same people who foisted and forced the 64 billion bank bailout on this country that added 64 billion euro to the national debt and which caused the policy of government austerity.  There's a minister now, Minister, You're an austerity minister, and he walks by.  This is Minister Charlie Flanagan, the minister for part of the austerity government that has misruled this country since 2011.  This is the same Charlie Flanagan who's promoting Project 2040.  He's running again.  Security bringing them off.  There are a lot of people from Langford that came over to congratulate me on what I'm doing.  Yeah.  Traitor!  Traitor!  Traitor!  Selling out Ireland!  Traitor!  We see what happened last week in relation to the beef deal.  Beef farmers have been sold out.  Beef farmers will become an extinct species.  They won't survive another few years of this government's failure to address the malpractices at the heart.  of the meat industry in this country, and in relation to corporate dominance of agriculture.  And corporate dominance not only in agriculture, wider than agriculture, when it comes to society in general.  The Minister for Climate Change, Richard Bruton, is talking nonsense inside, as he has made a living out of talking nonsense for the last 30 years.  I challenge Minister Bruton at the Fine Gael stand across the way in relation to the contradiction of the government's approach to punishing farmers and scapegoating farmers for climate change.  And at the same time, they're standing over, they facilitated and they're standing over a rigged beef deal, a raw beef deal that was negotiated last Saturday night, that sold out soccer and beef farmers in this country, giving them no, where there was no commitment to increase the base price, which is now at an unsustainable 3.45 a kilo.  And we have a situation where The 30 months age limit, the discredited 30 months age limit is locked into that deal.  All that was done in relation to the 36 months is to give a derisory 8 cents bonus for cattle sold or slaughtered before 36 months.  and to increase the quality assurance bonus to 12 cents to 20 cents for under 30 months.  Cattle slaughter at under 30 months of age.  Why challenge Minister Bruton, who ran away basically to this stand, from the Finebale stand, when there was an agricultural debate organised by his own party, on this issue?  Because if he truly believes in doing something for climate change, and if he believes that the carbon footprint from... the agricultural sector in this country is too great then he would embrace and be pushing.  he would be an advocate around the cabinet table for increasing raising the 30 month limit to 36 months because any farmer who knows who feeds cattle knows that to finish cattle before 30 months involves pushing them, feeding them with increased levels of concentrates and not taking advantage of the clean green image that we have as a nation where we have a temperate climate.  and where we can produce beef fed on grass, which can be easily done at 36 months.  In fact, you can finish beef steers especially at 34 months.  But 30 months is used as a price suppressing mechanism by the factories, that if you have cattle, 30 months and one day over, you lose your 12 cents bonus, or after last weekend's deal, the 20 cents bonus.  And you have to do it and 8 cents is dead.  That's punishing farmers and that's punishing the environment.  This man is talking inside about protecting the environment.  He won't come outside and talk about it, about his contradictory policies.  Everything is done for big business and corporate interests.  Everything is done to protect the lower corporation tax rates for multinational corporations, while we tax our own people to the hill.  And they're talking about introducing carbon taxes in the forthcoming budget.  I left Ballymahan picket on Monday.  They're still standing out on picket duty outside factories because farmers are not going to accept this deal.  And I realise and I understand that there are many other farmers out there that have to pay bills.  and they want to dispose of livestock.  and they're under pressure to dispose of livestock.  and what the policy of the meat factories been facilitated by Minister Crean and the government is to divide farmer against farmer, turn farmer against farmer.  Farmers must unite and unite against this deal and look for a realistic and a fair deal.  It's 19 years ago since the last beef blockade that I was involved in at the time when I was an IFA country chairman.  And again, once again, the same issue.  Price wasn't allowed to be discussed.  And it's because of these people in here, the European Union, that are interfering in the domestic affairs of this country, interfering in the crucial issue for Irish farmers, is the ability to negotiate a fair price.  to secure their livelihoods going forward.  Farmers at the moment are working for a loss and they're being subsidised for a loss and that's what the purpose of the Common Agricultural Poverty is.  The Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Cheap Food Policy is about subsidising farmers to work for a loss.  They give them, most farmers, three quarters of Irish farmers are in receipt of a basic payment of less than 10,000 euros per annum.  10,000 euros per annum.  And we have some, like Mr.  Goodman, who is in receipt of a basic payment of in excess of 413,000.  And we have on board BIA, on board BIA, which is a state agency, in receipt of a basic payment of 1.4 million.  That's how taxpayers' money is being abused.  And we're not getting value for money and farmers are not benefiting.  Farmers are again, as I repeat, being subsidised to work for a loss.  And they're being expected then to take the crumbs from the table and accept a derisory, worthless, raw deal that was negotiated last weekend.  that doesn't allow the crucial issue of base price, which is at the moment at 3.45 a kilo.  3.45 a kilo.  And just yesterday, not too far from here, Chagas, at their stand, they were saying that the base price that's needed to give a break-even situation for farmers, for livestock farmers, would be 4.17 a kilo.  4.17 a kilo and instead we're talking about 3.45 a kilo and we're talking about a 20 cents bonus on that for cattle under 30 months.  These people can run but they won't hide.  There will be a general election next year and Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il that's propping them up are going to take a drumming and it's up to you the people to not play tennis ball politics anymore.  Not think that you're punishing Fine Gael by voting Fianna F\u00e1il or vice versa.  to vote and vote for real change. ",
