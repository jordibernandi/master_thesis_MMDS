            "text": "The Title IX system and the fear and backlash over abuses in universities and sexual assault has resulted in a whole bunch of injustice and backwards cases.  This story from the Daily Caller was so shocking.  And I mean this, I really do mean it.  I had to absolutely do a segment on it.  It's a story about a man who was sexually assaulted, could prove it with audio recordings, and was still found guilty of being responsible for an assault on the woman who actually assaulted him.  The story is quite complicated, as all things are.  But this is, to me, one of the most egregious violations of Title IX, okay?  For those that aren't familiar, Title IX is, it does a lot of things.  It's basically about like gender equality, essentially.  And so what happened was feminists started arguing that because they weren't taking assault claims seriously, it was gender discrimination.  In response, they started taking them so seriously, they no longer use a general, you know, English common law standard of justice, just a preponderance of evidence.  They don't allow cross examinations or evidence or witnesses.  So the whole thing is just completely absurd.  It's not real justice.  It's kind of like, okay, for political reasons, we're just going to brush this aside and say the dude's guilty.  In this story, the man was apparently in a room with a girl.  He, for some reason, started recording audio, probably because he knew about this.  This is what's so freaky.  And the girl was saying things like, I want you and let's do it.  He was saying no.  And she forced herself on him.  And then later, like two days later or something like that, she claimed he assaulted her.  They wouldn't even let him admit the evidence.  He has audio recordings.  And The Daily Caller covers this.  Let's just read the story and figure out what's going on.  They say this, exclusive.  Columbia University found him guilty.  But he's got voice recordings and he's not afraid.  They say, it wasn't the balancing act high above Manhattan atop a water tower, nor her demands that she be effed and effed right this very second.  But the moment she suddenly said, we're in my apartment, right?  That made Ben Fiebelman glad.  he hit record.  What you're about to read is based on court filings, a 30-minute recording, and an interview.  Before warned, it is detailed and explicit.  I'm probably not going to get to everything, okay?  They say last May, Feebleman filed a $25 million lawsuit against Columbia University in New York federal court for expulsion and gender discrimination under Title IX.  A female classmate had accused him of sexual assault.  He says she assaulted him, not the other way around.  Despite the evidence, the school decided he was guilty.  His case is now in the discovery phase.  In all court filings, Feebleman's accuser is called Jane Doe.  But both sides are waiting for former President Obama appointed judge Valerie Caproni to rule on Columbia University's motion to partially dismiss the suit.  The ruling could come any day.  Defense was no longer enough for Fiebelman.  No, he wanted to bring it all down.  The night in question was fairly routine, they say.  It was a brisk Tuesday night, October 2016, when students gathered in the world room on the third floor of Poulter Hall.  Think high ceilings, exquisite art, huge picture windows overlooking the city's Upper West Side and Harlem.  Beer and wine flowed from an open bar.  Nobody's getting hammered yet, mind you.  This was a graduate reception at a dignified Ivy.  Not exactly right for sloppy hookups.  A woman plays a starring role in the space.  Stained glass panel, turquoise.  Okay, whatever.  We'll skip over this stuff.  They talk about the cost and everything.  The large group shrank, yada, yada, yada.  So eventually he said this.  He watched and she did a perfectly backward roll up the side of the water tower.  She taunted him about being a Marine who was afraid of heights.  She straddled on top of him on top of a ladder.  And then we're going to scroll down a little bit more, skip over a lot of the unnecessary parts, in my opinion, get to the crux of the story.  She talked to him in a hot, vulgar way back at his apartment.  Don't you want to F me?  She asked multiple times on tape in clear words.  In fact, she affirmed her desire to have sex with a classmate no less than 29 times.  She wanted him to F her, and she wanted it, in her word, hard.  He wanted it too, but something in his gut told him he'd better protect himself.  What's crazy about this story... is that this guy knew to press record.  This is what's truly terrifying.  He didn't want to hook up with her and he recorded the interaction because he knew this was going to happen.  Isn't that shocking to say the least?  Now I tell you this, how many young men have been accused?  The whole thing's been kept quiet.  They didn't record it and then they were expelled and no one knows about it.  This guy said, I'm going to press record.  And the only reason we know about the story and we're not accusing him of being a rapist is because he recorded her assaulting him.  But guess what?  As the story goes, they were messing around doing a bunch of things.  I'm going to keep it as it's not family friendly, but, you know, I'll avoid the more explicit details.  They say it was around this time she attempted to force herself on him.  I'll put it that way.  It was around this time, this point that Fiebelman sensed that things might go sideways.  So he pressed record.  Some things made him nervous.  When he first tried to leave, she started to cry.  He couldn't leave a woman in tears.  He wanted to leave on positive terms.  He liked her.  He liked his classmates.  He didn't want to be known as the class as class scum.  conversation took the form of a nightmarish loop.  She demanded rough sex.  He said no.  She asked why not.  He told her she's too drunk, but later said he didn't believe it.  She had stopped drinking hours earlier, he recalls.  He was just trying to employ what he describes in court filings as the nuclear option, which he believed would make the conversation stop.  Again, he tried to leave.  Again, she demanded he stay.  In the morning, you're going to thank me for not taking advantage of you, Feebleman says in the recording.  She didn't agree.  Or I'm going to apologize, she replied.  After many of her pleas and more of his denials, she seemed to snap back into consciousness.  OSFS.  Those are swears, by the way.  And this, Jesus Christ, okay, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait, no, what's going on?  He asked if she's okay.  After her confusion, she seemed to ease.  She returned to her refrain, I think you want to F me.  He said he did.  She told him to do it.  He said, you know how bad I want to do it.  I'm going to cut the more explicit details.  If you're watching on YouTube, you'll see them on the screen.  But for those that are listening, at least your kids won't hear, I guess.  They say for the entirety of the 30-minute recording, she forbade him from leaving.  On tape, he could be heard cooing at her cat and tucking her into bed.  It can also be her declining her relentless demands.  He seems to soothe her by telling her that he wanted to do her at a later date.  Some of his fantasies involved a bunch of fantasies.  At no point did she appreciate him saying no.  After a lot of begging and pleading, she asked why not.  He said, because I'm going to go home and go to sleep, and you're going to go to bed and get sober.  She continued trying to coax him.  We get the point.  So moving on, they say, he replied, I don't think you're gross at all.  I think you're gorgeous.  Just after 2  a.m.,  Feebleman left.  It wasn't even a day later when she accused him of assault under the university's Title IX statute.  She didn't seek medical attention or call the police.  She said, Ben tried to have sex with me, she told her roommate after he left.  She also told her boyfriend, who allegedly questioned how drunk she was.  She called him an a-hole, I'm assuming, and hung up.  That morning, she informed the school that female men had assaulted her.  Columbia University allegedly investigated the matter for six months.  In June 2017, a panel of three administrators held a kangaroo-style hearing in which they never used any evidence he provided or asked Jane Doe a single question about his side of the story.  Neither of the two investigators on the case even showed up.  In the end, the school withheld his degree, effectively ending his career in journalism.  Let me stop you right there.  You were going to school for journalism, buddy?  They did you a favor.  Your career, well, I get it.  Look, he's suing.  So in his claim, not getting his degree was damaging.  I can respect that.  But my personal opinion is that a J school degree is actually bad for you.  And it was a big mistake.  But anyway, moving on.  At one point, they warned him not to utter a word about a medical report he obtained that addressed her level of capacity based on 700 photographs and the 30-minute recording.  According to his legal complaint, a witness, Jane Doe, called to support her in Columbia's case against him, later called Fiebelman and told him that she sometimes mixed pills and alcohol to get over a boyfriend.  If he mentioned the report, Columbia authorities said they'd throw him out of the hearing and proceed without him.  Feeble Min had seven minutes to speak in which he said, please, please ask me about it, referring to his allegations against her.  School administration's administrators declined.  He had no voice, literally, apparently had laryngitis.  So he sat silently with his lawyer, who also wasn't allowed to speak.  In less than 24 hours, the panel declared him responsible for the assault as the result of consensual non-intercourse sexual contact he had with her prior to her demands for intercourse.  I'm gonna tell you something.  There is a secret.  So it's not really a secret, but whoever calls the cops, whoever reports it first wins, period.  I have been in circumstances where I was the victim.  I won't get into great detail about this story.  I think I've told it before, but I was attacked.  They called the cop.  I tried calling the police.  They grabbed me.  So actually, I'll get a little bit of detail.  I was attacked by security guards at a mall when I was like 19.  Out of nowhere, they just jumped me and my brother because I guess they had a report about somebody.  They mixed them up.  They thought it was us.  So they beat us up.  I called 911 because we're being attacked.  The security guard grabs the phone, hangs up.  911, the police try calling back.  He hangs up again.  He shows it to me as he does it.  When the cops finally come, it's because they called.  We get arrested.  And when we try explaining to the police that we were the victims, the cop says, I don't care.  We don't file cross reports.  They said you were disorderly, so we're arresting you.  And that was the end of it.  We ended up getting the case dismissed and winning, but nobody wanted to sue the city or the mall or get involved with it.  The mall had too much money.  Nobody wanted to do anything about it.  No justice served.  In this case, we have a similar story.  This guy seems to be the victim.  She was pressuring him, threatening him, trying to force herself on him.  So we recorded it.  And when he says, please, please, please, he wants to address this.  They refuse.  They won't take his complaint.  Why?  She went there first.  Let me tell you what happened.  In my opinion, she filed this report against him because she knew she assaulted him and to prevent him from filing a report.  She filed it first.  There you go.  The problem with the system.  Unless we have a legitimate court of justice at these universities, you will end up with these insane cases where the school doesn't actually adhere to any standard and just says, what's going to save us the most money?  Fine.  Throw the guy out of the school.  Keep his degree.  Congratulations.  Now you're facing a massive lawsuit.  You'll probably lose.  I'm going to wrap it up here.  It's a really long story and you kind of get the point.  They go into great detail.  This is a really long story.  The general thing I wanted to convey, though, is the gist of the story.  There's lots and lots of details, but I'll give you the final conclusion on this.  The last paragraph, they say, never mind.  This is one of the daily callers.  Look, I'm not a fan of this kind of writing.  I absolutely detest this kind of writing.  No dig against the author or anything like that.  I'm just not a fan of narrative news.  I would much prefer a very simple explanation of what happened with details and then links to some of these details.  But they say that apparently the guy is not a choir boy, I guess.  On his personal website, he shares lengthy stories about his life with reckless abandon.  In one story, his idea of a party favor is a bag of dicks.  In another, he cleared the air path of choking, vomiting, or whatever.  Sounds like a really bad guy.  They say his Instagram is a wild ride.  The pictures are artistic snapshots of his life.  Whatever.  I'll tell you this.  I don't care what this guy is.  I don't care if he is just a generally unethical or amoral dude.  If in this particular instance, he has evidence that she was the one forcing herself on him, It is shocking that he was the one who was found guilty of it.  But there's serious problems in our universities.  This story kind of points to that, you know, but stick around.  I have another segment coming up in just a few minutes.  This video, this story requires a lot more time.  So I'll put the link in the description and I will see you all in the next segment. ",
