            "text": "Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthfication Chronicles and I don't know if you had a chance to listen to President Trump's two hour long speech, but it was great, wasn't it?  I mean, it was so entertaining.  I love it when he goes off script and I'm sure he didn't plan on it being two hours long, but it was.  and wow, it was just so full of different things.  I am going to do some clips in another video and at the end of this I'm going to put a clip.  But I wanted to tell you about one of the people that he mentioned when he went to Iraq.  He mentioned seeing this guy and meeting this general named Raisin Cain.  Now, the guy called himself Raisin, but his name was Dan Cain.  As far as we can tell, this is what the Anons came up with.  They came up with this document, which is a declassified transcript of an interview that he did with the National Guard Office of Inspector General.  And it was September 28, 2001.  Now, if you remember, shortly there before, there was a big event in the United States that I'm not going to mention, and this guy was there.  So you can't help but wonder... hey, does he have some information about it that maybe we don't know?  And maybe this is why Trump pointed him out so much.  Because when you hear the clip at the end, you're going to find out that he did.  He talked about him a lot.  So... He mentioned the name quite prominently.  And usually when he does that, it's because that's somebody that the Anons need to dig on.  It's somebody that they really need to spotlight and to look into.  And so this, like I said, this is what they came up with.  And if you look down here, it talks about it.  Now, there are some places where it's redacted.  Not a lot.  There's 39 pages.  So obviously, I'm not going to read it all.  And there's nothing huge in this that you can see.  However, it does tell, you know, it does have some places where I think some names were redacted, and some basic information like what their true mission was when they were up in the air, and he said that he couldn't talk about that, and that it was secret.  So... I don't know what that is.  Maybe this is something that will lead to that.  This was secret, but now it's declassified as of, I think it was 2014 is when it was declassified.  I should say somewhere.  I don't know.  Anyway, probably at the end.  I saw it somewhere.  Oh yeah, right here.  Declassification date, September 29th, 2014.  So it has been declassified, this part of it, but there are still redactions.  And again, we don't know for sure what's under those redactions, but it could be very interesting.  And I wanted to get this out to you so those of you who enjoy looking through such things can look into it and read through it yourself and listen to what President Trump has to say about him.  And there's a couple other things I want to point out in this clip that you're going to hear.  is he talks about being at the white house all alone and we know that over christmas uh... we know that that's where he was.  and he talked about five hundred machine guns outside of the white house 500.  I mean, that's not just a little.  So I think that does maybe lay a little bit more weight on the idea that there was an assassination attempt and they were trying to protect him from that.  500 is a lot.  And he talks about them being up in the trees and everything.  And I think that's just unusual.  I can't imagine that they... typically have 500 there.  I mean, maybe they have some, but 500 is an awful lot of troops.  So I'm not sure that that is standard operating procedure for the White House.  It doesn't appear to be, in my opinion.  But again, maybe there's something I don't know.  I know it's a fairly large facility, so it could be that they need a lot of people.  But that just seems unusual.  It seems like a lot more troops than they would typically have to protect him.  And so I do think that there probably was something going on.  and that likely is why you know nancy pelosi and her buddies were trying to get out of town because of the bus and i did a video on that.  so you might want to see that video anyway.  that's what i've got for you on this document.  i'll leave the link down below so you can read it for yourself.  and will it lead to something?  i don't know.  but right now this is the guy.  evidently from what he said this is the guy he was talking about And he does refer to himself as Raisin.  I think it's like right here.  Please identify yourself.  Sure, it's Major.  At the time, he was Major Dan Cain.  I go by Raisin, and I am the Chief of Weapons and Tactics at the 121st Fighter Squadron, 113th Wing, District of Columbia Air National Guard.  So, you know, this is the guy, apparently.  And it was very interesting that POTUS talked so much about him.  So listen to the clip, see what you think about it.  And then I'll come back and tie it up at the end. ",

And then I flew to Iraq.  First time I left the White House because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places.  And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay?  I figured it would.  I figured it would look good.  So I stayed in the White House.  And I'll tell you what.  I was there.  I told my wife, go to Florida.  Enjoy your Christmas.  I stayed for Thanksgiving.  I said, I mean, I was in the White House for a long time, months, months.  I had cabin fever in the White House.  But if you've got to have cabin fever, that's the place to do it.  But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months through Christmas.  I spent my New Year's all by myself.  Don't cry.  It was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns. ",
