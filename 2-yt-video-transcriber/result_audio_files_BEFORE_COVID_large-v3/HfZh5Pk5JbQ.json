            "text": "So when I say, who do you want me to interview?  One of the most common names that comes up is Ben Shapiro.  As I've said before, I'm glad to talk to Ben Shapiro on the program.  Anytime.  I would gladly appear on Ben's new Sunday special program anytime, although I don't think he's interested in appearing on my show and I don't think he's particularly interested in having me on his show.  But what we do have, and this is an interview that a lot of people have not seen.  because the channel was like one fifth its current size when this interview went down many years ago is that I actually did interview Ben Shapiro some years ago and we talked about gun control primarily.  There are some interesting moments.  There are some funny moments.  Uh, but in the absence of a new interview with Ben or my appearance on his program, uh, this is the last time that Ben and I spoke in a public broadcast setting.  Joining me is Ben Shapiro.  He's Breitbart News editor at large, also author of the new book Bullies, How the Left's Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America.  So, Ben, I saw your recent appearance with Piers Morgan.  It was very, very entertaining.  I think you did way better than Alex Jones did.  I'm hoping, though, that we can have really kind of a productive conversation.  I mean, we have... we're the same age, we have similar backgrounds, both have families with ties to the Holocaust and Eastern Europe.  and politically we are very very different.  but that being said i would love to see if we can get any kind of consensus on assuming that we're both kind of in good faith really have the goal of reducing the number of people killed by guns in the?  u s which i believe that you do and i i know speaking for myself that i do.  can we come to some kind of consensus about really what would help putting aside whether those solutions would fall under democratic or republican ideas?  so i hope that helps a good place to start.  i think that is what do you think really is the cause of gun violence in this country?  i mean is it is it education?  is it the wrong people having guns?  is it too many guns?  is it not enough guns as some people have said?  it?  is it liberals?  i mean what is the problem?

And that may mean tailored solutions for different cultural backgrounds, but that seems to me the real root of the problem.  Otherwise, we can pass as many gun laws as we want, but the truth is this.  Britain has a lot of gun laws on the books.  They have five times our violent crime rate.  So if we really want to end not just gun violence but violence violence, then that's going to take a shift in culture more generally. ",

So we have to be looking at solutions that will actually work.  And the truth is that broadly tailored solutions, I mean, it's possible there's a different solution for Chicago than there is for Montana.

Those would be good weighing factors.  And what we have to do is we have to create a culture with strong male role models, a culture where people have the opportunity to get out of poverty, and a culture, honestly, we need to jail more criminals.

The Constitution is a document of negative liberties.  The Bill of Rights is also a document of negative liberties, but it carves out actual spaces where government can't go.  I mean, you know this.  This is why there was the debate between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists.  The Anti-Federalists said, there's no point to a Bill of Rights.  It actually infringes our liberty because it says to the government that it can go all these other areas.  The Second Amendment, when it says that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, it also is that it doesn't.  first of all the second amendment applies to the the federal government not to the states.  uh... but it's in and that is a huge thing that has been overlooked in constitutional history uh... but even assuming that applies to the states the fact is that the state has always had and and always did have the ability to prevent private citizens from on.  in canada i mean there were.  there were laws on the books when the constitution was written preventing people from owning certain types of weapons.
