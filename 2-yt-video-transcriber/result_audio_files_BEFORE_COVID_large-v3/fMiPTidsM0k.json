            "text": "Good evening, my brothers and sisters.  So I like to get in my car and just, you know, worship, go into worship mode.  And I just, you know, pray.  And sometimes the Lord would download something for me and I'll share it with you guys.  And a lot of other times the Lord would say, I want you to go and say this to my people.  And so I feel that if you log into this live tonight, this word was specifically for you.  i feel that the lord put this word in my spirit and this is not going to be a long video.  it'll probably be three four minute stops.  so i was worshiping sitting here in my car and the lord said tell them i know and the way that that began to develop in my mind it's like he put that seed in my mind.  he said tell them tonight that i know all right.  i know every tear that they've cried.  I know every person that has broke their heart.  I know how they've been faithful when they didn't feel like being faithful.  I know how they kept going when they didn't feel like going on.  i know when they wanted to quit.  i know when they wanted to stop.  i know when they wanted to sin.  i know when they wanted to throw in the time.  but i also know the good.  i also know their labor of love.  i've seen how they have forgiven.  i've seen how they've been long suffering been patient.  i've seen how they've taken the blows taking the hits and so the lord wanted me to just tell you quickly tonight i know he wanted you to be reminded that he knows You feel like maybe God has forgotten about you and you see life passing you by.  You see other people being blessed.  You see other people just going with their life.  And it seems like, you know, maybe nobody's concerned.  The Lord says, I know.  Now, if you know that he knows your responsibility is to respond like he knows, not respond how you feel, but respond like my God knows that I'm in the storm.  My God knows that I got to face this giant.  My God knows that I'm going through this trial.  And if he said that he'll never leave me nor forsake me.  All right.  If I know that I know that he sees what I'm going through, then I have to respond like it.  even if i don't feel it even if i can't see it even if things are not going my way i have to take comfort in the fact that he knows and that's what the lord why he said.  just tell them that i know You are not forgotten.  Your blessing, your promotion, your relationship, your marriage, your healing, your deliverance, your prayers, your turn is coming, but you just got to stay planted.  If you stay planted, you can produce fruit.  you got to be planted in your emotions.  you got to be planted with your worship.  you got to be planted with your praise.  you got to be dedicated.  you got to be committed regardless of the wind that is blowing around you.  i'm planted i'm rooted and i know that if i stay rooted in this spot that the rain is going to come.  i know that if i stay rooted in this spot the sun is going to shine But if you don't believe that, you're not gonna stay rooted.  If you don't believe that, you're not gonna stay planted.  I told you guys at the beginning of the year, the Lord said, tell them, go into 2020 expecting him to do something.  Stop walking around like you don't serve a mighty God.  Stop walking around like you don't serve the best thing that has ever happened to you.  Stop walking around like he doesn't have the victory in his hand.  Stop walking around like your God is defeated or your God is like one of these dead idols, these statues that can't speak, that can't respond.  The Lord says in 2020, walk around expecting the unexpected.  And what that means is I don't even know what you're going to do, Lord.  I don't even know how you're going to do it, but I know that you're going to do something.  So I'm expecting the unexpected.  And finally, the Lord told me to tell you, if they give me something, I'll give them something back.  If you give him praise, he gonna give you something back.  If you give him worship, he gonna give you something back.  If you give him your problems, he gonna give you something back.  If you give him questions, he gonna give you answers.  If you give him your sickness, he gonna give you healing.  If you give him your chains, he will give you deliverance.  If you give him your bondage, he will give you freedom.  If you give him your cares, he will give you peace.  If you give him your sadness, he will give you joy.  You say, Brother Marcus, how do I give it to him?  When I pray, I release it.  I surrender it.  When I worship, when I don't feel like it.  When I praise, when I don't feel like it.  He says, if they give me something, I'm going to give them something back.  If they touch the hem of my garment, I'm going to touch them back.  If they call on my name, I'm going to respond.  But understand, he might not respond how you think he should respond.  He might not respond how you want him to respond.  But this is the thing about being rooted and trusting that he knows what's best.  That I can trust that he will respond in the way that is best for me.  Total surrender.  Total brokenness.  lord i'm giving you this situation and i got my ideas about it but i don't want my ideas to become idols.  lord i'm giving you this situation.  i got my feelings about it.  but lord if you want to change my feelings if you want to change my outlook if you want to change the way i respond change the way that i think about it change the way that i see it that is fine with me.  the problem is so many of us get stuck.  Well, that's just the way that I feel.  That's just the way that it is.  That's just the way it's always going to be.  It ain't never going to change.  This is just who I am.  This is just how my family is.  This is the situation.  It's their fault, his fault, her fault, my mama's fault, my daddy's fault.  And the Lord is saying no.  If you give me something, no matter what it is, I give you something back.  If you give me your talents, I give you something back.  If you give me your obedience, I give you something back.  If you give me a sacrifice, I give you something back.  Whatever you give him, whatever you give him, he's going to give it back greater, bigger than you could ever imagine.  Might not be in your timing.  But in his timing, it's always perfect.  And it's always on time.  I love you guys.  You be blessed.  You be encouraged.  Don't you give up.  Some of you get on these live videos and you hear me say it every time.  Don't you give up.  I promise you, your season will come.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows who broke your heart.  He knows who did you wrong.  He knows who cheated on you.  He knows who cheated you out of some things.  He knows how you've been overlooked.  He knows how you've been rejected.  He knows how people have hated on you, plotted on you, schemed against you.  He knows how your father wasn't in your life.  He knows how you miss your mother.  He knows how you miss your grandparents.  He knows you feel rejected in the church.  He knows that you can't seem to find the right church.  He knows it all.  Acknowledge him in all your ways and he will direct your path, because he knows the best path for you.  Be blessed, be encouraged in Jesus' name. ",
