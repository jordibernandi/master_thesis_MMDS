            "text": "Yeah, so I was diagnosed with stage three colon cancer when I was 26.  And of course it was a shock.  It's always a shock when you're diagnosed at any age.  But it really, you know, it turned my life upside down.  Sure.  And one of the first things I did after I was diagnosed was prayed about it, right?  I mean, I was desperate to understand why am I going through this?  What's happening to me?  I mean, in the first segment, you're all talking about, you know, the... when the water starts boiling, right?  So that was my situation.  And the first verse that came to me was Romans 8, 28.  God works all things for the good of those who love him and who are called according to his purpose.  So I just chose to believe that.  This is my verse.  I'm believing this.  And also Psalm 34, 19, which you guys talked about as well.  The righteous may suffer many troubles or afflictions, but the Lord delivers them from them all.  So I focused my faith on those two verses.  I had surgery.  I was kind of rushed into treatment, which is pretty common for most cancer patients.  They're rushed in.  They don't know what they're getting into, but I had surgery.  I was recovering from surgery, and I made a decision to forego chemotherapy.  The reason I did that is because my instincts and my intuition were just telling me it was not right for me.  I came across some information and had sort of revelations about cancer, about health that are pretty simple, really, and that's the way I was living was killing me.  And I realized, wait a minute, if many of our cancers today are caused by our diet and our lifestyle and our environment, We need to change what we're doing, right, to help ourselves either get well or prevent it.  And so I sort of embarked on this radical life transformation journey, which we'll get into those details.  But I changed my whole life in every way possible and was just determined to do everything I could do to help my body heal.  And I got well.  Wow. ",

And so that's one of my sort of core issues.  mission elements, I guess you could say, is just to help empower patients with knowledge so they can make a smart, wise decision about treatment.  So for me, I took a calculated risk.  I said no to chemotherapy and I decided to overdose on nutrition.  So when you look in the Bible, you see the Garden of Eden, the original diet for mankind was fruits and vegetables.  And so I basically decided that's all I'm going to eat, fruits and vegetables, all raw, no cooked food, no animal food, no processed food.  So I eliminated everything man-made and everything from an animal and just ate fruits and vegetables. ",

That's an important dynamic of the relationship that needs to be in place.  Beyond that, yeah, it's true.  They're not trained in nutrition.  There are hundreds of thousands of published studies on nutritional science that doctors are not taught.  They're too busy doing what they're trained to do to really read and research this information.  Here's one big takeaway.  We know that 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day is considered optimal for disease prevention.  So 10 servings of fruits and vegetables every day.  That sounds like a lot, but it's actually not that much.  A serving is only about half a cup.  So a bowl of oatmeal with some fresh berries, you're going to get three or four servings right there.  A fruit smoothie or a big salad, you're going to get three or four servings.  Dinner, having a salad or some cooked rice, beans, potatoes, greens, spinach, broccoli, whatever, you're going to get another three or four servings.  So it's easy to hit 10 servings of fruits and vegetables every day.  Now, I was eating between 15 and 20 servings every day because I was really going overboard.  Overlord, yeah.  Yeah, I was just trying to give my body everything it could possibly use to repair and regenerate and detoxify. ",

And he didn't have extensive nutritional training, but he was in a position in his life where he'd come back out of retirement and he really just wanted to help patients get well.  And so he was very open and he was studying integrative and non-toxic therapies to help patients.  And so he was an amazing blessing in my life.  And I found a naturopathic nutritionist who was also very helpful and encouraging at the time.  And so, yeah, we monitored my blood work every month.  I had CT scans every six months for the first few years.  But doctors are really hesitant to say you're cancer-free, you know, that kind of stuff until you hit the five-year mark.

There's three categories.  One is an unhealthy diet.  Two is our lifestyle choices.  And three are environmental factors like pollution.  So the diet that is causing cancer is the Western diet, the American diet.  And that's a diet that's really high in meat and dairy.  It's really high in processed food, junk food, fast food, sugar, salt, and oils.  When you look around the world, the countries and regions with the lowest rates of most cancers eat a plant-based diet.  So they're eating mostly plants.  They're not vegetarians or vegans per se, but their diet consists mostly of food from the earth.  that God made, and their access to animal food and processed food is very low.  So imagine if you lived in the African bush, and you're in a village, most of the food you eat is the food that you grew, with the occasional animal food.  If the village was having a feast, or maybe somebody killed something in the wild and brought it home, but what you're gonna subsist on are plant food.  So it's a very simple thing, eating a plant-based diet, For someone that's interested in prevention, what this means practically is going from eating meat three times a day to maybe three times a week.  Make it more of a special occasion versus in every meal. ",

And we know that Jesus's ministry was focused on forgiveness.  What did he say in the Lord's prayer?  Father, forgive them.  I'm sorry.  That's what he said on the cross.  Forgive them for they know not what they do.  And in the Lord's prayer, he said, forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us.  So throughout his whole ministry, he's talking about forgiveness and how important it is.  So I want to encourage you right now.  There's someone in your life you need to forgive.  And there may be more than one person.  And the way to forgive is just like this.  You just, I can walk you through it.  We'll just pray through it, right?  So this is how you pray.  You just say, God, You know what they did.  You know how I feel about it.  You know how much they hurt me.  But I'm choosing to forgive them right now.  I'm letting it go.  And I'm giving it to you.  They're all yours.  I'm not going to carry this anymore.  And I'm asking you to bless them.  Bless their family.  Bless their business.  Bless their children.  And I thank you for forgiving me and for blessing me in Jesus' name.  Amen. ",
