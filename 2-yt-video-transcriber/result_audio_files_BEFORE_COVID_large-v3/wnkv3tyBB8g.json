We went to the Plastown, New Hampshire Police Department at the safety complex there, and, um, well, did not work out so well.  Tyrant lost it, retaliated against me for practicing my First Amendment right, and then verbally accosted Hot Toe Truck Girl.  Video's crazy, got crazy real fast.  Take a look and enjoy, and let the Plastown Police Department know in New Hampshire exactly what you think.  What's going on, guys?  It's Josh, the accountability for all, and today we're at the Plastow Police Department in New Hampshire.  We're going to see if they respect our First Amendment right and our constitutionally protected activity.  Let's take a look.  Interview rooms always look like a jail cell.  It's supposed to look like that.  The only walls that look like that go, oh, Jesus.  I hate that.  Well, it doesn't mean they failed.  It's just the way the building's built.  Can I help you?  Someone just talked to me?  I'm over at the other one.  Oh.  I thought God just made contact.  Oh, how can I help you?  I'm good.  Just walking around, thanks.  You know, I do have a question.  You're probably a dispatcher, not a police officer, right?  So this is actually law.  This isn't my opinion.  Flag code policy says that the United States flag has to have red, white and blue on it if it's displayed in an official capacity.  So that flag, being the way that it is, is actually the same as if you burned it in front of the White House.  It's desecration of the flag.  Did you know that?  And I think that you guys should... I mean, obviously you guys like to believe in the public and protecting the public, so... Can I what?  Not record?  You know what I mean?  It's actually a public area.  Can you come down to the lobby?  There's a guy recording me.  Is this a public building?  I mean, maybe it's a public, this could be private.  Is this a private building?  It's a guy recording dispatch.  Okay, he can come if he wants.  I guess we'll find out if this is a public or a pro.  This area is under 24 hour.  Sorry, lens.  I may have a problem with me filming.  I'm on dispatch right now, guys.  This is a guy filming in the lobby.  We need some help immediately.  Oh, there's cameras right there.  Hello?  What's going on, man?  How are you?  Not too bad, how you doing?  Can I have your name and badge number, please?  Yep, name's right here.  I obviously have goggles.  Yep, name's right here.  You can read, right?  All right, well, if the judge asked you what your name was, you wouldn't say name's right there.  And you are?  I don't answer questions.  Okay.  I was just taking a peek, and she said that I... Is this a public building or private?  This is a public police building.  Okay.  As you're aware.  Well, I got confused because she told me not to record her because it was private.  Okay, well, she's a dispatcher, so... Okay.  So could you give me your badge number, please?  So my name's right here.  Right.  As you can see.  Right.  And as I told you, I can't see.  Badge number 91.  91.  Okay.  Anything else?  Yeah.  Someone burns a flag or desecrates it, that's a violation of flag code policy.  Not aware.  You can look it up.  Penal code states that it has to have red, white, and blue if it's displayed in a public setting.  Okay.  All right, man?  Cool.  Thanks.  What's going on?  How's it going, Sergeant?  What's going on?  What do you mean? ",

Wait, he ran your plate?  Yeah, that's what he said he was doing.  And what crime did he suspect you of committing?  Now, it is public information.  He said, are you with the person in there?

Well, it's legal for them to run your plates because it's considered public access, so they're basically doing the same thing I'm doing, but I'd love to know that it was illegal.  Now, you know what?  I was going to leave, but now we're going to just check out the fire department.  Stay tuned, guys.  Really appreciate it, and that's the reason I stopped you today.  What's going on, guys?  It's Josh with Accountability for All, and today we're in Plastown, New Hampshire.  The police station just got an epic fail, and then they afterwards, as you saw, they came out to run Hot Toe Truck Girl's plates because she wouldn't tell them if she was with me.  She doesn't have to in a public police station parking lot.  That's public access, right?  And then she says, oh, you know, you could be sleeping or something in there.  Sleeping is not a crime and being suspicious is not a crime.  So that's retaliatory in itself.  So we're going to be going back in and getting complaint forms.  But today we're at the Plastow Fire Department conducting a First Amendment audit.  These guys are the real heroes.  I mean, they run into fires to save you, and the police don't do that.  Police don't do that.  You know, what the police do is refuse to identify complaint forms.  I'm going to need complaint forms.  I'm going to have to go back in.  and get some complaint forms.  I don't even want to audit this fire department right now.  Because these fire department guys, they do the right thing.  You know, they're working to run into the fires to save you.  They're working to make sure they save your life.  And the police next door are running plates and telling people that it's illegal to sleep.  So we're going to go back in and get some complaint forms today.  And they're going to learn that it's we the people, we're gonna issue some citations.  Shiny badge does not grant extra rights.  Sorry, Miss, can I just get two officer complaint forms, please?  Thank you.  That's awesome.  And could I speak to the sergeant one more time, please?  If he's available, thank you.  All right, so just gonna open this up, and I'm gonna take out these officer complaint forms.  I'm gonna fill these out.  So these are Plastar Police Department citizen compliments and complaint forms.  Okay.  We have two officers we're going to fill out today.  Now, a license plate is public.  Hey, Saj, quick question.  So, I'm very aware the lawyers are probably going to understand at this point.  A license plate is public, right?  However... to run a license plate in a retaliatory manner is actually illegal.  So I went outside, and it's all on film, and you guys asked if she was with me, and she didn't have to answer.  Oh, it was this officer.  Okay, so he asked if she was with me, and she doesn't have to answer that question, because she's not detained.  So he said, well, if you're not going to tell me, I'm just going to go around.  And then he runs the license plate.  And then there's someone sleeping with a seatbelt on, even though the car's in motion.  And he's saying, oh, you got someone sleeping back there?  That's not good.  So my issue is, number one, I didn't know when sleeping became a crime.  And number two, what was his reason to run that plate?  Because I have an audience of a combined 100,000 subscribers.  And this one's going up.  So I'd like to know why he ran that plate. ",

So you're going to get a lot of calls.  Okay.  And now I'm going to, I'm not going to go into any unauthorized access points or across any unauthorized places, but now I'm going to start... recording the cars, the cruises that you have out there, and I'm going to go on Spokio and I'm going to run them on a reverse plate check just to make sure there's no warrants, because they're in public.

Like he should automatically assume that no crime is being committed and nothing's being wrong.  He should see if like, I don't know what the issue with the camera is, but you see your 24 hour filming.  When someone comes into a lobby, I'm practicing my first amendment.  When I came out here, I didn't detain him and disarm him because he's got a gun.  That's his second amendment activity.  I can't assume if he's carrying a gun, he might be doing it for nefarious purposes.  So, I mean, I appreciate you being nice, but that officer, he's a tyrant.  The word tyrant was created for people like him.  And I'm not sure what happened, but you seem very nice.  So hopefully you can coach him and educate him because it's bad cops like that that give good cops like you a bad name.  And I'm not going to present.  I don't edit my videos.  I don't leave things out.  So when I put them up there, people are going to decide for themselves.  I'm going to tell you one thing.  10,000 people can't be wrong.  And I have a feeling what they're going to be calling to let you guys know.  But I appreciate what you do.  But you've got a tyrant there.  It's your safety.  When you're out in the field with him and he does the wrong thing or tries to violate somebody's rights, it could be your job.  God forbid that person is armed.  It's very important that people like that have a tight leash.  But I appreciate it, man.  Have a great day.  And that's how we deal with boys.  They work for me.  And that's what you call throwing each other under the bus.  Well, he's right about the views.  Until next time, guys.  That's the reason I stopped them today. ",
