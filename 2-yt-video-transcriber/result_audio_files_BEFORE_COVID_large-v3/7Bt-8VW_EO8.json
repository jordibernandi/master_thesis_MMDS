            "text": "Benjamin Bleeding Anal Fisher.  Shapiro was created in a laboratory on January 15th, 1984, in a failed attempt to create the world's most realistic pocket vagina.  Though he is indisputably a vagina, he doesn't quite fit in the average pocket, thus why he was considered a failure.  Originally, his creators were going to throw him in an incinerator, but when it was discovered that he was quasi-sentient, they instead decided to train him to be a conservative commentator.  Ben Shapiro has written 10 books, including his 2004 New York Times bestseller, Diarrhea Spewing Prolapsed Donkey Butt, an autobiography.  Despite being completely unlikable and wrong about literally everything, he became the youngest nationally syndicated columnist in the United States at the age of 17 and currently serves as editor-in-chief for The Daily Wire, which he founded.  He also hosts The Ben Shapiro Show, a daily political podcast and radio show funded primarily by contributions from the feminine hygiene product industry.  Ben Shapiro identifies as Jewish, though this is disputed by God himself, who said in a recent interview, I had nothing to do with that guy.  Here is more Ben Shapiro. ",
