            "text": "Hey everyone!  So right now, I am in Bangkok, Thailand, and I wanted to show you around some of the stuff I've been getting up to for the last week or two.  Me and Fiona have been having such a good time here that I just wanted to show you some of the stuff we were getting up to.  But first, I want to tell you about this video's sponsor, the Dollar Shave Club.  The Dollar Shave Club's razors are the only ones that I've packed for this trip because they're the only ones that I need.  They're incredible, they leave my legs feeling super smooth, and I just really like them.  Plus, they have a shave butter and a bunch of other, like, toiletry-type things that are a travel size that are Perfect for taking on a trip.  They've got stuff for oral care, deodorant, and shower gel.  So I really can't recommend them enough.  And if you go with Dollar Shave Club, it also means you never have to get a razor from one of those stores where they have like a super gendered aisles where there's like men's shaving stuff and women's shaving stuff.  Because they'll just send you a box every month with your replacement razors.  And this razor is totally gender neutral, so it doesn't matter what your gender is.  You just get one of these nice, sturdy handles with the detachable heads, and you can get replacement cartridges sent to you every month.  If you go to dollarshaveclub.com slash riley, you can get your starter set for only $5.  That starter set comes with the weighted handle, a box of the cartridges, and a 3-ounce tube of their shave letter.  After the starter set, the restock box ships regular sized products at their regular price.  So I just wanted to say a huge thank you to Dollar Shave Club for sponsoring this video because I love their product and their sponsorship allows me to keep making videos like this.  So if you'd like to try out that $5 starter set, you can go to dollarshaveclub.com.  slash riley.  Alright, let's go explore Thailand! ",

When we first got here, Fiona got pretty sick, so we were spending some time inside.  But she's feeling better now, we've had a good time.  And we've spent some time just inside working, which would be boring to see.  But it's been a really good trip.  You have a good time, babe?  I've had a great time.  Nice.  But yeah, that's about it for this one.  I'll be making some more travel stuff as we hop around to some other places, but thanks for sticking around for this one.  And I'll see you next time.  Bye!
