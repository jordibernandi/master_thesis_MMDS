I drive past it every day going between the Bronx and Queens.  In fact, the Washington Post reported on the Trump Links Bronx course in an article entitled, Taxpayers Built This New York Golf Course and Trump Reaps the Rewards.  That article is where many New Yorkers and people in the country learned that taxpayers spent $127 million to build Trump links in a, quote, generous deal allowing President Trump to keep almost every dollar that flows in on a golf course built with public funds.  And this doesn't seem to be the only time the president has benefited at the expense of the public.  Mr.  Cohen, I want to ask you about your assertion that the president may have improperly devalued his assets to avoid paying taxes.  According to an August 21, 2016 report by the Washington Post, while the president claimed in financial disclosure forms that Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida was worth more than $50 million, He had reported otherwise to local tax authorities that the course was worth, quote, no more than $5 million.  Mr.  Cohen, do you know whether this specific report is accurate? ",
