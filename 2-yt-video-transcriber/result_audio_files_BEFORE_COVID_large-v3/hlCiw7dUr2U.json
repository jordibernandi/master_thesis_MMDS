And I wish I could be the perfect daughter, but I go back to the water no matter how hard I try.  Every turn I take, every drill I try, every path I make, every road leads back to the place I know where I cannot go, where I long to be.  See the light as it shines in the thick of me And no one knows how far it goes.  If the wind on my sail of the sea stays behind me One day I'll know.  If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go.  I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island.  Everything is my design.  And I know everybody on this island has a role on this island.  So maybe I can roll with mine.  I can lead with pride, I can make us strong.  I'll be satisfied if I play along.  With a voice inside, it's a different song.  What is wrong with me?  I see the light as it shines in the sea.  I mean, no, I know.  How deep it goes If the wind on my sail And the sea stays behind me One day I'll know.  If I cross the line.  Will I cross the line?  I am a woman.  See the light that shines in the sea.  It's got me.  And no one knows how deep it goes.  Is there wind on my sails or the sea takes me on me?  One day I'll know.  one day i know how far i'll.  Thank you. ",
