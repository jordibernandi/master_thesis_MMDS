            "text": "Bible Answers with Dr.  Al Garza.  All right, welcome back to Bible Answers.  I am your host, Dr.  Al Garza.  And this is my podcast on Bible Answers.  Today I'm going to be discussing something that's come up quite a bit in relation to my book, The First Trinity, and in regards to Genesis 19-24 from the Hebrew and how the Hebrew reads and how it reflects back to Genesis 18 and 19.  So I want to kind of discuss this briefly and kind of give a... A little bit about the Hebrew grammar and how Genesis 19.24, you know, emphatically shows that it is not one Lord or one Yod-Heh-Vav, hey, the Tetragrammaton, but more than one.  And I'm going to argue for the three.  And that's very easy to do based on the context between 18 and going into 19 of Genesis.  So let me explain this.  So what we have here in Genesis 19.24 is, And I'm going to read from the English.  Now, some have speculated that this is referring to two, just two individuals, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh and Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh out of heaven.  And that's not the case when you go back a few verses in its context.  That's referring to actually not just the two messengers who came to Lot, but also going back to Genesis 18 where the three men appeared before Abraham.  And Abraham went out to greet them and bowed down and said, O Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, O Adonai, the plural name of God, Adonai.  So let me clarify a couple of things before I get into the grammar here.  The context, and remember, in the original Hebrew manuscripts and texts, there's no chapters and verses.  It just continually flows within the Hebrew.  Chapter and verses are added much later, around the 13th century.  So we won't get into that, but that's not in the original Hebrew text.  We know that from the Dead Sea Scrolls and so forth.  But let me explain this.  We have in Genesis 18, going back to the context, that three men appeared to Abraham.  Abraham looks up and says, the Lord appeared to Abraham.  Abraham looked up and saw three men, anashim in Hebrew.  It doesn't say that he saw the Lord in two men or the Lord in two angels or two messengers.  It says he saw three men, anashim, the equivalent of each other.  He saw three.  Then he got up and went to greet them.  That's the verb of to greet them, to go meet them.  We won't get into the Hebrew too much, but it's pretty clear just from the English that he went to greet them and he bowed himself down.  He prostrated himself and said, O Adonai.  And again, Adonai is the plural form of the Tetragrammaton, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  And here, it is used for the first time without Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh in connection with it.  Usually be the Adonai, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, the combination.  And this is the first time out of 134 to 136 places where Adonai appears by itself without Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  This is the first time.  So Abraham is the first one to call the three men to greet them as Adonai, which again is the plural name of Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  So, and again, utilizing it to three men.  Now, again, if you continue reading, you find that they speak as one.  They said, they said, and then it is Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, the Lord speaking to Abraham and then to Sarah.  So obviously the Lord is there.  He's one of the three men, but some Jewish interpretation, some other sources might try to, actually commentators might put out that this was the Lord and two angels or or these are all three angels and giving them names.  Well, that's an interpretation.  That's not in the text.  That's an interpretation.  The text by itself and the Jewish understanding of pashat, the simple meaning is that the Lord appeared, he saw three men on Hashem, and he greeted them by calling them Adonai.  Them, not him or singular form.  He greeted them as Adonai.  And then they speak as one.  And then the Lord, of course, speaks.  But the interesting is, if you go down a little further in Genesis 18, the Lord asks the question when they get up to go with Abraham.  The Lord asks, shall we tell Abraham what we're about to do?  Or basically, shall I tell you what I'm about to do in regards to Sodom and Gomorrah and destroy the cities?  And then the Lord answers and says, I will go down.  I will descend and I will go to Sodom and Gomorrah.  So the Lord asks the question.  The Lord answers and says he will go down.  So what happens?  The next verse, the two men get up and go down to Sodom and Gomorrah.  So again, this is in relation, again, to what we just read.  That the three men appeared as the Lord himself, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  They're called Adonai.  The Lord asks a question about telling Abraham what he's about to do.  And then the Lord answers and says, I will go down.  And I will go down to Sangamor to hear their cries.  I've heard their cries.  I will go down.  Again, the I, the singular form of I. First person singular.  I will go down.  I will descend and see.  And then who goes?  The two men.  So again, and then of course, the third stays with Abraham.  So this is interesting because when we get to Genesis 19, we see that Lot sees the two messengers.  Now, Moses is writing as these are two messengers coming.  Why?  Because they're about to deliver a message to Lot about what's about to happen and what he needs to do and flee.  So Abraham reflects now not as two men, but two messengers because of what they're about to do in warning Lot.  And how does Lot greet them?  Lot greets him the same way with Adonai, not Adonai.  Adonai.  And there's only slight difference in the Hebrew vowel points of a Komet and a Patak, the short A and the long A sound.  So again, he calls it Adonai with the short A sound, but still the same meaning, Adonai, not Adoni.  He did not use Adoni, which is a different vowel point.  So again, Lot dresses in the same way.  Abraham does.  Now, again, I have to argue, of course, there was no vowel pointings In the original Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls, this comes much later in Jewish tradition.  But even when they added them, they understood that this was the understanding of Adonai, not Adonai.  Adonai would be my masters or my lords, which again applies to humans and people and so forth.  Whereas Adonai is a name that derives directly to God himself.  And we just saw in Genesis 18 in context that it was the Lord himself who appeared as Anashim, three men.  So here Lot addresses them, the two messengers, as Adonai.  And then again, he does it again in Genesis 19, verse 18.  He addresses again.  So when the two messengers bring him out and they tell him to go escape to the mountain in verse 17 of Genesis 19, Lot turns to them and says, And again, the Hebrew is Vayomer lat alachem alna Adonai.  And Lot said to them, no, please, Adonai.  Nope.  Again, he uses this time with the vowel points.  He calls them by the plural name of God, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  No, please, Adonai.  Vayomer lat alachem, to them, alna Adonai.  So again, we see Lot addressing by the very divine name, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, in the plural form of Adonai.  And then you see, of course, he asked to go to a different location and they grant him.  But then we get to verse 24.  So we've already just, before we just saw all three being called Adonai, the plural name of divine name of God, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  And in verse 24, we see, Then Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.  In the Hebrew, of course, it is Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh who goes to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah with brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven, Adonai out of heaven, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  But in the Hebrew, of course, which is from, there's a Hebrew direct object marker, which points to the next subject or noun of the verse.  In this case, when it says and, in the Hebrew, it is va'et, va'et, or sorry, from, ma'et, ma'et, mem, aleph, tav.  And it uses the aleph, tav, the et, the direct object marker, Because what it's saying is that the next noun or direct object of the text is referring to Yod-Heh-Vav, someone separate, distinct than the first Yod-Heh-Vav or Adonai.  So they're not the same.  They are separate individuals being called Yod-Heh-Vav in the Hebrew.  The first Yod-Heh-Vav in the beginning is reflected of the two men that Lot just called Adonai.  And then you have the third at the end, from out of heaven, or by the Lord out of heaven, referring to the Lord who was with Abraham, the one who left him and descended back to heaven.  So you have all three in the text.  And that is by the direct object marker, the olive and the tab that reflects back there.  Now again, I'm going to read this from a Hebrew grammar book.  So that verb is, of course, the Lord will send or send down fire or rain upon fire and brimstone.  from the Lord out of heaven, Ma'et, the et there, showing that these are two separate names being applied to different individuals.  The first two men with Lot and then the Lord who left Abraham.  That's how the Hebrew reads in distinguishing here that it was the Lord Adonai who were with Lot who are going to reign upon Sodom and Gomorrah, brimstone of fire from Yod-Heh-Vavah who had left Abraham and went back to heaven out of heaven.  The Hebrew grammar using et there to point to the next direct object of the noun that it's going to reach from the verb is showing they are not the same individual.  These are two different Adonais, but the name Yod-Heh-Vah being applied to the two men as Lot used as the plural form Adonai in Genesis 19.18.  So this from the Hebrew grammar cannot be ignored.  So if someone wants to say, well... That, you know, well, the angels or those messengers can be called Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, but they're not Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  They're representing Him, but they're called by the name.  Then what they have done, if anybody wants to say that Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, the divine name, the Tetragrammaton, can be applied to anybody else other than God, has simply now diminished that.  and lowered the bar of the application of the name.  The name itself to any Orthodox Jew, to any rabbi understands that that name is a special name that represents God in the past, present, and future form and means from the Eternal One, the Almighty, and that name that was spoken to Moses, the Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  That name is brought together by the application of the past, present, and future of the Eternal One, and to say that it can be applied to anybody else just destroys the supremacy of that name, saying it doesn't really mean much.  Anybody can be called, the Messiah can be called Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, the angels can be called Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  So what's the point of the name?  The name now really means nothing.  The name itself represents the eternal nature of God, yet you won't apply it to just anybody that it's called.  Oh, to the angels, to the men, to the Messiah, as if it's a broad, sweeping, generic name.  This name is applied to the Almighty, understood by all Jews and Orthodox Jews and rabbis, of being special and designating the eternal nature of God.  So those three men who come... In the name of God, that name Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh is, are, and is Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh manifested as the three men and the messengers, the two that left and went to see Lot.  That's why they're called Adonai.  That's why in 24, it is Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, the two men who rained fire and brimstone out from Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh from heaven.  That is all three.  That is what is referred to in Christian circles as the Trinitarian view, Trinity view.  And Jews understand this, why they had to reinterpret it as angels or some other non-Trinitarian say, oh, well, it's referring to those two men can be called the name, but they're not the name.  Then the name means nothing.  If you want to apply that name to pretty much anybody that you think it can be interpreted to, then it has no meaning.  There's no... I mean, it's just belittling the name to the eternal nature of God who is, who was, who is, and who will be the eternal one.  As spoken to Moses and to Bernie Bush.  It has meaning.  Every Hebrew name has meaning reflected back to the person.  And you can't just diminish it.  Specifically, the Tetragrammaton, the Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  So... This is an argument that cannot be really refuted from the Hebrew grammar of Genesis 19-24 with the direct object marker et, the Aleph Tav there in the Hebrew pointing back to the other, Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, who was with Abraham.  So the two and the one is the three.  And they're all called Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh and they're not just given that name because they're representing him.  That name represents who he is and he revealed himself as three men to Abraham and then to Lot.  So that's how we got the first Trinity.  It is not pagan.  It does not come from pagan sources.  It is in the Hebrew and the Hebrew text alone.  And the name itself represents the eternal one as the divine person who is.  God is spirit.  And when he revealed himself, he revealed himself as the messenger, the word, and as the almighty.  And we see that later on.  And again, this is in my book, The First Trinity, which you can get a copy on Amazon.  But I want to thank you for listening.  This is Dr.  Al Garza at Bible Answers Podcast.  If you have any questions, you can leave them here, comment or email me.  I'll be glad to discuss it with you.  But again, this is something we need to kind of not gloss over and try to just interpret it in some other way.  But again, thank you for listening.  Please like and subscribe and share.  And again, this is Dr.  Al Garza, Bible Answers.  Thank you for listening and God bless. ",
