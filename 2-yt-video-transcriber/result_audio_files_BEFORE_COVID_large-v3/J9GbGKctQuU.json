            "text": "Here's what I'm believing for.  I know it's never happened, but I know that it must before the end.  There must be not just individuals.  I'm thankful we have individuals that are rising up with such anointing, such strength.  We have people scattered all over the planet right now that are just making a mess of things in all the right ways.  We're so encouraged.  But what I'm believing for is a generation.  A generation will rise up with a corporate faith, a corporate anointing to press into realms.  because it's my conviction that as much as God put on a William Branham or a Catherine Kuhlman or a Wigglesworth, he'll put far greater anointing on a company of people than he ever would on an individual.  And to do that, there must be that corporate sense of.  we have to deal with the issue of obeying the rules of this kingdom to tap into the resources of this kingdom. ",

Lake in Healing and Miracles, it's because of the divine power of the Holy Ghost and his grip on dominion and his grip, and I'm not just talking about him, I'm talking about many men and women in the past.  William Branham had a gift of a word of knowledge that was so scary.  It was so scary.  He wouldn't know exactly who the person was in the back of the crowd, what city they came from, what car they drove, what their neighbor's house looked like.  This is crazy, and people were like, and it gripped men's hearts.  It gripped women's hearts with such a ferociousness that there was no way to escape the love of God. ",

            "text": "Several years ago, I was laying on the floor.  I think it may have been in a prayer chapel.  And I was asking God if I could have the mantle of William Branham.  I just got done, in fact, Bill has a series of video, old videos of William Bram and I just watched one of them where he called out about 40 people in a row and he said, your name is like John and your doctor's name is Dr.  Henry and you got cancer or whatever.  and your sister Mary told you to come here and did that with about 30 or 40 people on this video.  So I got done watching that video.  I'm like, oh my goodness, I don't even have a prophetic gift.  So I was in the prayer chapel and I'm laying on the floor and I said, God, would you give me the mantle of William Branham?  And he said, well, how could I do that?  If I did that, it would destroy you.  So I was laying there.  It was like the Lord asked, how could I do that?  So then I said, I waited about a few minutes and I was thinking about it.  I said, well, you could put the same mantle on a whole generation, then we wouldn't stand out.  from one another.  he said alright I'll do that not awesome that's what the Lord wants to do. ",
