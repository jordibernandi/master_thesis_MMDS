            "text": "So do you think that the children that are apprehended at the border that are in government, U.S.  government care, whether it's a U.S.  government agency or it's a Catholic relief agency that's being contracted by the government, do you think like babies who are going to die should be resuscitated and be given care?  Do you believe that like a baby who's born alive during an abortion in a Planned Parenthood should get care?  What's the difference?  No, my question is, what is the difference?  No, because I'm going to answer your question.  I actually wrote down your points.  But I want to know from you, what is the difference?  Why do you care?  about a mom whose risk made a dangerous journey through Mexico, through Central America, put her life, her child's life at risk.  Why do you care that we should give, we should use taxpayer dollars to say she crosses the border, her child's severely malnourished, and her child is dehydrated, right?  For example, my son was in the hospital last week with severe acidosis because of dehydration and could have died.  So... So she comes across the border and she has a baby in her arms that's dying, right?  Should we pay for that child's healthcare?  Yes.  If a child is born alive during an abortion procedure, because sometimes the abortionist misses the heart when they're administering the digoxin, should the abortionist have to provide healthcare to that child?  No.  Why?  Because they're performing an abortion.  So before that, they've already determined that It's not a baby.  I know you're telling me that science has determined one thing, but... You just said they determined it's not a baby.  How can an abortionist determine... How can an abortionist not determine it's not a baby?  Excuse me, I'm dialoguing with her.  How can an abortionist determine it's not a baby?  Why is it not a baby?  is what I want you to tell me.  Why do you think it's not a baby?  Because it's fetus.  What if it hasn't been born yet?  But if it has been born, so if this baby comes out of utero and the digoxin hasn't been successful in inducing cardiac arrest and this baby is alive.  Well, first of all, I think that's a really rare occasion.  I think it's a really rare occasion.  So I don't think it's all abortions.  It is rare, but it does happen because a group of abortion survivors are just at the White House.  So it does happen.  So do you think it's a baby? ",
