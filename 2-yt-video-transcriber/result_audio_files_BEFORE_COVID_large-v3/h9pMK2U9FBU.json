            "text": "So people now send me this stuff so frequently that it's really difficult to keep up with.  But this one leapt off the page because it's CNN, right?  So, you know, these people have real money to spend on real reporters who are meant to investigate things.  And what do they come up with?  This 13-year-old scientist, I don't really think there were any 13-year-old scientists, may have designed a better version of the Hyperloop from Francesca Street and CNN.  And look, there's an awesome, awesome picture, an engineering sketch of what this new improved Hyperloop is going to look like, which is something.  Something?  CNN, several rival companies may be hard at work trying to get Elon Musk's Hyperloop concept off the ground, but are hurtling across the country, maybe even across continents.  They can't even get it to hurtle to the end of the block, and they certainly can't get it to carry people at 600 miles per hour in low-pressure steel tubes.  It still feels far from reality.  Remember the steel tubes thing, that's going to come back in a second.  But the 13-year-old New York student Caroline Couchley may have invented a more economically viable and eco-friendly Hyperloop solution.  Really?  You don't think you might be overselling this?  A 13 year old?  has come up with something that wasn't, ah.  Anyway, Couchly's idea just won second place in the annual 3M Young Scientist Challenge to build pneumatic tubes next to existing tracks.  Right, so, yeah, one of the best plans that you ever have with a railway, it's the land issue, the land rights are a big problem, so building things on parallel lines is actually a sensible enough idea.  But building pneumatic tubes next to regular tracks, for what purpose?  Magnetic shuttles would travel through these vacuum tubes, okay, so that would be the Hyperloop, connected via magnetic arms to trains traveling on existing tracks.  So how does that help you even in the slightest?  I mean what what I got a working hyperloop.  Why do you need it connected to a train?  right because fundamentally you're.  The thing that's mostly gonna limit you here is the air resistance on the train is which you're going to get no matter whether you're powering it by a maglev here, or you're going to turn this into some maglev anyway.  Why not just put the train inside or onto the maglev?  Anyway, the system would utilize current train tracks, thereby cutting out, because that's fine.  It says eradicating the potential risks posed by propelling passengers in a vacuum.  okay so no people go in the hyperloop.  fine there'll be no need for trains to. ",
