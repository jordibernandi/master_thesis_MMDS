Alright, let me go ahead and show you what Google Earth is actually based upon.  You see, Nathan, Google Earth is actually based upon the WGS 84 geode.  That's where they get.  They're elevation information, and it's above mean sea level.  This has absolutely nothing to do with drop.  If you want to look at drop, one of the things that you can do is look at a tangent line to the horizon.  Here, let me give you an example.  Okay, so let me see whether or not I can help you out a little bit.  Now on the bottom, you will see Mount San Jacinto.  and this is from Google Earth, and I want you to pay attention to that area right there.  You see that one little red line that goes from the bottom to the top of the mountain there, or towards the top of the mountain?  That's the line of sight from Malibu, California.  Now, if you look, there is actually a small line that kind of goes at an angle to that, and it's just off to the right side.  That line marks Malibu.  6,200 feet or so of this mountain.  Now on top, you will see JTOLEN Media 1's image of San Jacinto.  So if we make the Google image a little bit opaque and we superimpose it up on the San Jacinto image from JTOLEN Media 1, you will see that each of these little peaks line right up and there's the mountain.  Now you notice right here in the box, we have that little cross line at 6,200 feet or so, and that is literally right on the horizon of the Pacific Ocean.  The rest of this mountain, which is this part down here, is all below the curvature of the Earth, including down here by Gilman Hot Springs down at about the seven o'clock position at the bottom.  All that mountain below that little hash mark is below the curvature of the Earth because the Earth has curved over it.  But the elevation of the mountain is given in sea level and the elevation of the observation point was also given in reference to elevation above mean sea level.  So this is where your lack of understanding is really coming through.  Yes, both these sites have an elevation above mean sea level, yet because of the intervening curvature, you're missing a lot of this mountain, see?  And that's the difference between looking at elevation above mean sea level and looking at the drop on the curvature of the Earth.  Here's the drop.  Both sides have an elevation above mean sea level.  There you go.  Okay, let's go back to this drawing real quick.  Now recall that on this, what we had was we were looking at elevation above the surface.  And since all of the pins on our sphere were the same height, the elevation above the surface was the same.  Now, the fact that the bottom line here is straight just has to do with we are naming the surface as our baseline.  We're not making a statement about the shape of the surface.  We're simply graphing elevation above the surface here.  Now, surely Nathan Oakley understands that.  Well, let's see. ",

So Google Earth has been a flat Earth map all this time by its own measurements.  And They said, but the line is curved.  Well, they put an arc in it, but they have the same elevation the whole time.  You went along that graph that showed elevation over the course of that line.  It never changed, but it looks curvy.  Therefore, it must be a ball earth.  That's how bad it is in the chat. ",

People came into their chat to try and correct them, to tell them that these elevations were above mean sea level.  And Nathan Oakley does nothing but point to that little box, the elevation profile, and say, look, the bottom of it's flat.  I mean, how do you counter this?  How do you counter this sub-elementary school level of comprehension with an argument from logic or facts.  You really can't.  But these are the people that presume to tell us what an independent variable is and how to conduct scientific experiments.  These are the people that call astronomy and seismology pseudoscience.  Nathan Oakley and Quantum Eraser are the people the Flat Earth community look up to for scientific knowledge.  Yet this is their level of comprehension.  It's absolutely unbelievable.  The only thing that I can think of is that this is some sort of a joke on the Flat Earth community that they're just trying to, they got together over lunch one day and said, let's see what kind of nonsense we can put out that they'll eat up.  You know, they're all idiots.  So this is them quantum eraser and Nathan Oakley telling you that you're an idiot because they expect you to go along with this.  And their little echo panel just does.  And you heard the young lady saying, well, this just makes perfect sense to me.  Well, no, it really doesn't.  You know, folks, If nothing else, this is a great example of why you need to stay in school and actually pay attention.  All right?  This is why you should go out and seek knowledge rather than seek dogma and listen to people give you narratives.  So in any event, well, thank you very much for stopping by.  Remember to, you know, just kind of go down there and hit that like and subscribe because I just passed 10,000 viewers or 10,000 subscribers and I'd like to get to 20.  So take care from Northern Michigan.  This is Bob the Science Guy.  We'll see you again real soon.  This rabbit hole's too deep for me.  Feel my brain getting real sore.  Up above the side sky. ",
