            "text": "The choice of a running mate is always a serious concern for a presidential candidate.  The selection is a serious early indicator of a potential president's judgment, and the choice can have serious campaign consequences.  Barack Obama chose Joe Biden as his VP after the guy had unintentionally made some pretty racialist comments about him.  We got the first sort of mainstream African American who was articulate and bright and Obama's selection signaled to Americans that he has rather thick skin, and they would not have to tiptoe around their first black president.  In the very same election, John McCain chose Sarah Palin, and while I don't want to dunk on a departed war hero, his pick indicated less than perfect judgment.  In 2016, Trump's choice of Mike Pence was an attempt to reach out to more traditional establishment conservatives.  Hillary's choice of Tim Kaine signaled to progressives that, while she would certainly appreciate Bernie's endorsement in campaign rallies, his political revolution was unlikely to have a place in a Clinton White House.  For Bernie in 2020, the choice of a running mate is more important than ever.  Should he win, he would be the oldest president ever elected to a first term, beating the record of the current commander in chief.  While unlike Trump, there have been no serious discussions surrounding Bernie's physical or mental aptitude, his advanced age heightens the significance of his VP pick, and the urgency of the decision.  The sooner he picks a running mate, the sooner voters can know who would be in charge should the worst happen.  As such, the discussion surrounding Bernie's running mate predates his 2020 announcement, and by a lot.  George Solomon put a pretty strong shortlist together for Medium all the way back in August of 2017.  At the end of February 2019, the Toronto Star published one of the most out-of-touch opinion pieces I've ever seen, suggesting Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Oprah as potential VP picks.  That's not a good list.  What hints Bernie has already dropped?  rule out all four of these options.  I'm going to break down Bernie's stated preferences and tell you who I think is most likely for him to select.  I'll also touch upon this slightly different question, who should he pick?  During an appearance on The Late Show back in December, Stephen Colbert asked Bernie Sanders what he thought about Beto O'Rourke.  Bernie gave a perfectly nice assessment of his grassroots campaign, before pivoting to talk about Elizabeth Warren and then Cory Booker.  Bernie also brought up these two, and only these two, in his interview with The Breakfast Club.  His bringing up Warren should be no surprise, as the two have been friends for decades.  Warren is often described as the second most progressive senator, and she is a serious ally in the struggle against Wall Street greed, having developed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Then he mentions Booker, a more unlikely friend, as while Booker is progressive on many issues, he's well known to be funded by Wall Street.  According to Open Secrets, Booker's top donors have included financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, Apollo Global Management, and Morgan Stanley, as well as New York corporate law firms like Paul Weiss, Gibbons P.C.  and Sullivan and Cromwell, and the pro-Israel PAC, NORPAC.  But Bernie's mild praise is not likely to lead to an offer when it comes to selecting a running mate.  In a more substantial and relatively recent interview with The Young Turks, Bernie gave some serious clues as to who he may be thinking of selecting. ",

I think we would look for somebody who is maybe not of the same gender that I am, and maybe somebody who might be a couple of years younger than me, and somebody who can take the progressive banner as vice president and carry it all over this country to help us with our agenda and help us to rally the American people.

            "text": "Here.  it may not sound like he's saying much, but he's actually whittling the field down quite substantially.  I read from his comments three qualifications he's looking for.  His VP must be a woman, younger than Bernie, and a genuine progressive.  Let's break this down.  First, when it comes to someone who is not the same gender as Bernie, that takes Cory Booker out of the running.  It also means no Beto, no Biden, no Buttigieg, no Barack, no Bennett.  No Brown, no Bullock, no billionaire Bloomberg, and no Bill de Blasio.  He won't consider Castro or Yang, neither of the Johns, nor will he consider Ojeda or Gillum, no Jay Inslee, Tim Ryan or Terry McAuliffe, nor Seth Moulton, Wayne Messam, Chris or Phil Murphy, Jeff Merkley, or Martin O'Malley.  Anyway, you get the idea.  It's going to be a woman.  That eliminates about half of the possible options.  The next clue is not as useful.  Younger than Bernie only eliminates two prominent female Democrats that I can think of, Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein.  I don't know that anyone suspected he would consider either of them, but for what it's worth, they're definitively eliminated.  Next, let's move on to the next and final hint.  That one's a little more open for interpretation.  So let's listen to it one more time. ",

            "text": "So who is a younger female progressive who Bernie thinks could spread the message all around the country?  The establishment press would likely guess Kamala Harris.  She certainly is a strong campaigner, great at articulating the progressive agenda, but I'm not sure Bernie or his supporters would consider her progressive enough.  A good starting place might be to look at the standout victorious candidates endorsed by his group, Our Revolution.  Aside from Bernie himself, the most famous member of this group is probably AOC, but as a woman who is too young to run for president, she's probably a poor choice for VP.  Tulsi Gabbard was also supported by Our Revolution, and is certainly a favorite amongst Bernie fans.  She's been pretty solidly progressive for a good seven years now, and has proven herself to be a strong, charismatic competitor in the race for 2020.  Tulsi also meaningfully proved her loyalty to Bernie Sanders in 2016 when she stepped down from the DNC.  But there are some reasons to doubt this choice.  I've never seen Bernie mention her.  There doesn't appear to be a personal relationship there, and that could be a problem.  Bernie tends to work with people he knows well, and keeps friends for a very long time.  Take for instance Bernie's 2016 campaign manager Jeff Weaver.  The guy began his career as a campaign staffer for Bernie way back in 1986, and Bernie's stuck with him ever since.  Bernie even put him in charge of Our Revolution.  When he proved unpopular there, Bernie kept him in the organization, and while no longer campaign manager, he remains with Bernie for his 2020 run.
