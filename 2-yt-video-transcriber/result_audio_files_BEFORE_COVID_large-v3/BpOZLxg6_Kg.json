He disgusts me at a fundamental level.  So in typical flat earth style, if you've no idea about the concepts that you're discussing, it doesn't matter.  Just resort to name-calling.  You stupid old bastard.  You deserve pain.  I was going to say, I was hoping for a little more civil discourse tonight.  I bet you were, yeah.  I think everybody was.  Anyway, we're going to have a look today at how Nathan Oakley reacted when he was presented on his own Flat Earth Daily Debate show with three very sensible questions about the shape of the Earth.  Now, do you think that Nathan Oakley, A, presents articulated and educated responses to these points, or B, do you think there's more chance of bumping into a snowman in a sauna?  Well, we're going to find out in a minute, but before we do that, we have to meet Nathan Oakley's partner in crime.  A certain Mr.  Quantum Eraser, who at this point is actually, believe it or not, speaking to a friend of his.  You should be hung for sedition.  You should be institutionalized.  Right?  Me and you, we're done.  You come on the show, I'm going to rip your frigging eyes out.  So the scene is set.  Nathan Oakley and Quantum Eraser do a daily show where they do a good job of pretending that they believe the Earth is flat, but a really bad job of pretending they understand anything about even basic science.  And enter our hero, Mr.  Jose Gonzalez.  Now, Jose runs his own chat show, which is linked in the description, and it is absolutely superb.  And he's appeared on Nathan Oakley's show to present him with three very sensible questions in the hope that he might get some sensible discussion out of them.  Here are the questions.  Right, so question number one, an extremely reasonable question.  Do we actually have any photographs of a flat earth or of a dome or of an ice wall?  Do any photographs of anything like that actually exist?  Question number two, are there any calculators online that can make accurate predictions about the world around us and our observations using the flat earth as its starting position?  And final question number three, do Nathan Oakley or Quantum Razor have any long-range observations that actually support the idea that the Earth must be flat?  Now, we joined the debate straight after Jose has asked question number one, which is, do you have any photographs of the flat Earth?  Now, remember, Nathan Oakley runs his own daily debate show, On the Shape of the Earth, where he repeatedly asks his own subscribers for money so he can prove that the Earth is flat.  So a simple question like, do you have any photographs of a flat Earth, surely shouldn't provide much of a problem. ",

But our hero, Jose, doesn't want to get dragged down into pedantic, silly arguments.  He knows he's proven his point.  Nathan Oakley cannot produce any single image of a flat earth and neither can any other flat earther.  So he moves on as fast as he can to question number two, which seems to anger Nathan a little bit and also anger his partner in crime, Quantum Eraser, who in about 45 seconds time loses it in hilarious fashion.

Like this website which uses our understanding of the heliocentric model to predict exactly what the moon phase will be at any given time and date and exactly what the moon will look like from any given location.  Or this website which again uses our understanding of the heliocentric model to tell us what stars and planets will be visible from any given location on earth at any given time.  Or more common websites like this which can tell us the weather thanks to the information we collect from satellites that are orbiting the earth.  we have the curve calculator which accurately enables us to predict how much of an object will be hidden because of earth curvature from any given distance and any given elevation.  or this eclipse calculator which again uses our understanding of the heliocentric model to tell us when eclipses will occur and precisely which location on the globe they'll be visible from.  And I could go on, but I'll finish with this one, the ISS Transit Finder.  All you've got to do is plug in your location, and it will tell you exactly when the International Space Station will travel overhead from your location.  And it works every single time.  So the significance of this question is obvious.  We are able to make repeated, accurate, and reliable predictions of all the observations we see around us using models that have the Earth as a globe.  But if we were to make our starting point the Earth being a flat plane, none of those predictions would be possible.  And nobody, nobody has been able to create any kind of calculator that has predictive capabilities of the observations we see around us using the Earth as a flat plane, which would indicate that the Earth isn't flat, simple as.  Now, when presented with this point and asked for some sort of predictive calculator, do we think that Quantum Eraser surprises us all by A, giving us a lesson in advanced geometry and showing us where we're wrong, B, gives us a lesson in advanced astronomy, showing us where we're wrong, C, gives us a lesson in advanced seismology, showing us where we're all wrong, or B, do we think he just handles it in the only way he knows how?
