            "text": "What's up YouTube family?  Hope you guys are having a great Monday.  I am on my lunch break about to run up to UPS and ship out the boxes that I had put together for my two giveaway winners.  And so I wanted to share a dream that I had with you guys last night.  I thought it was pretty insane that... So today I had text... Because me and Saved by Grace and Lily Girl are in a group chat together.  We talk all the time, but I had texted them this morning and told them about the dream that I had.  And all of a sudden, Saved by Grace, Christina comes back.  She literally had a dream.  It was just crazy.  I'm not going to talk on her behalf or tell you guys about her dream.  I'm sure that later she's going to upload the dream that she had.  But it was just crazy that I had this and then she had that and then we started conversing about it.  I'm conversating about it.  So I'm just going to go ahead and share with you guys what happened.  So I was driving down the road and all of a sudden I'm driving and I just had like complete pure like panic and fear because all of this destruction just started happening and I thought that the rapture was happening but I wasn't sure because I didn't hear the trumpets go off.  I didn't hear the trumpets sounding and so I'm freaking out because there's panic and everything going on there's destruction happening and so immediately well no before I get on the phone I look up as I'm driving in the sky and I see like these white spirit type things floating up in the air and or not up there, they're kind of, they look like they're just all over the place, like they're, and then they're like diving down.  And I called, so immediately, I called Flora.  I called Lily Girl.  And I'm on the phone with her, and I was so happy that she picked up the phone because I knew that the rapture didn't happen.  I was just, I was, it made me feel better to hear her voice, and I'm yelling, and I'm like, Flora, you know, like, what's going on?  What are these?  Because I, like, I had an understanding that She was seeing them too.  I said, Flora, what are these?  I remember her telling me that they were souls that were going to hell.  I just thought that was wild.  At that time, as I had called her on the phone, I had pulled into this gas station.  And then I guess I pulled back out on the road and I'm driving with somebody, I don't know who's driving.  So we were going down the road and we were driving down road along the beach.  kind of reminded me of the little island that I'm from.  but um I'm driving down this road and there's houses on each side like you would see on an island like on the beach.  and I'm driving and this tsunami is coming.  I knew the tsunami had hit And as I was driving down this road, I'm looking and the water is just completely just starting to flood the road in front of me.  And I'm yelling at whoever is driving and I'm like, stop, like turn around.  We can't go through this.  The roads, it's starting to just completely just be just flooded with water from the tsunami that had just hit.  And I'm yelling at the person to turn around and the person that is driving, they're like, are you sure?  And I'm like, yeah, I'm sure.  Like we, we can't go through that.  And I just complete panic and destruction was happening.  And so we turned the car around and then I remember seeing, um, these, they were, they They weren't like the spirits that I had seen.  So after that, I had seen rockets or missiles or bombs or something.  Missiles flying up into the air.  Then I had an understanding.  So after all this is said and done, after I woke up and earlier, I had an understanding that What Flora saw were the souls that were going to hell that had died from those rockets or those missiles hitting.  And so I think what I was seeing was that I was seeing the destruction and the panic and I was seeing the tribulation.  And now I have an understanding that what I saw was This is just, I feel like as soon as the rapture happens, like as soon as the rapture happens, it's going to be complete panic and complete chaos and destruction will come.  So I knew that the rapture did not happen yet.  I knew it was basically, it was any second.  And I just, I know that what he was trying to tell me is that the... That the rapture is very soon.  And right after the rapture happens.  Destruction is going to come.  And then... And then I did see, I saw the souls that were going to hell, um, that were dying from all of the destruction.  and Flora had told me, and that's, that's what they were that I was seeing or that she was saying and that we were seeing, um, people, the souls that were going to hell from, you know, being blown up by the missiles and stuff.  Because the second time I had seen what I saw in the air, I knew that they were, um, that they had something to do with each other, if that makes any sense.  Um, Christina had just a chilling dream of a tsunami hitting and then another one happening and so I'm gonna let her come on and I'll tell you guys about that.  But man, he is coming.  And I just know that like I feel like and I know what he was trying to say is that the rapture is so soon and that basically like as soon as it happens, it's just going to go like downhill from there.  So I wanted to share that with you guys.  I don't care what people think because way before I have ever been on YouTube or ever thought about creating a YouTube channel, I have dreams from the Lord and I've had them since I was a kid.  And I know when they are from him because of the very first one that I ever had.  And God says, the Bible says that in the end times or in the end days that people will dream dreams.  They will prophesy.  They will see things.  They will have visions.  And that's what he's doing.  He's showing us things.  that are soon to come.  So people can mock and scoff all they want, but it is what it is.  And so when I get something, I have to share with you guys because I want you guys to know what I'm getting.  All I can tell you guys is it's gonna be really, really bad.  when we are out of here and that's why I don't think I really don't think that people are understanding the true importance of saving helps help saving as many souls as we can because when the rapture happens like that's it there's going to be people there to be left behind.  and right now we have the opportunity to help those people not be in that situation.  Because, and I don't even think people are fully grasping how bad the tribulation is going to be.  How bad the destruction is going to be.  I don't think people even have a clue.  I don't know if people even think about it or even read Revelation.  But it's going to be worse than any movie producer could ever even think up.  It's going to be worse than anything that anyone has ever seen on this earth.  So... I urge you guys to rise up, step out in faith, get uncomfortable, share the gospel.  And this was on my heart yesterday, and I was going to tell you guys this, but I forgot.  When you're planting seeds, there are going to be many people where you plant the seed and they may not come to faith right away.  But the reason why it is so important to plant the seed?  because there's going to be a lot of people that you've planted that seed and you've told them about the rapture.  You've told them about God.  You've told them everything that's going to happen.  You've tried to tell them you know, to bring them to faith.  You've tried to tell them about Christ, but they didn't want to listen.  There are going to be many, many, many people that are going to come to faith after the rapture, and they're going to be saved.  They're going to go through hell on earth, but there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be saved, and a lot of those people may be because of you, because you planted that seed.  So, it's up to God.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, it's up... It's up to God.  All we can do is plant the seed and he's going to come along.  There may be people that come along and water it, but God saves.  So you just plant the seed and you just leave it in his hands.  And that's all we can do.  So I wanted to share that with you guys.  I know that destruction is coming.  I know the rapture is coming so, so soon.  I can't wait for you guys to hear Christina's dream because it gives me like literal chills.  So I just wanted to share that with you guys and I'm going to run and ship these packages out.  Hope you guys have a great rest of the day and I'll talk to you later. ",
