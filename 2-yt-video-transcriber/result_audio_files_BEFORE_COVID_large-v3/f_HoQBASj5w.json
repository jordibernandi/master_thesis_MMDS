Let's roll with this.  South Park.  You know, I grew up watching South Park and they always are coming through with the clutch anti-SJW, anti-political wreck.  political correctness uh skits that they do with these little kids that are just out of control and funny.  i haven't watched it in a very very long time probably in about five or six years but this video came across my feed and i felt like it was necessary for me to talk about.  This video is funny, man.  Listen, they are literally making fun of and drawing a connection to reality as it relates to how this gender identity thing in sports is really going to be a detriment and cause chaos and confusion as it continues to go along and as people begin to take more advantage of it.  So in this scenario, there's this big muscle dude identifying as a woman and just trying destroying women.  let's watch this video man.  a beautiful day in morrison colorado as we get ready for the sixth annual strong woman competition a two-day long competition of tests built to push athletes to their very limits.  you already know this about to go south.  you already know.

            "text": "Oh, man, so listen, it goes on to show him smashing them.  I'm talking about breaking their arms during arm wrestling.  I mean, he throwing up five or six times the weight that they doing and just running the gamut, man.  And I love that South Park did this because in the spirit of this political correctness BS, we don't get that honest subconscious ideology about how ridiculous the trans people in sports things have become.  Now, you understand, and I think we both can agree, that it's one-sided, right?  You're not gonna have a man or a woman turn into a man and then go into sports and dominate.  I have never seen that happen.  It probably never will happen.  Show me a record that has been broken.  when you put a woman who transitioned to a man and competed in male sports and break records.  Show me and I'll shut my mouth and I'll delete all of my videos about it.  Until then, I'm gonna keep telling the truth.  But you do see consistently across the board, across age groups, across demographics that when these men transition to women and they compete in women or female sports, they dominate.  they don't just win.  they don't just compete.  they dominate they win.  i mean i've experienced this in my personal life.  riding the tour to tucson there was a a person who transitioned.  i even went on a group ride with this person and 50 other people.  but this person was on a group ride.  so i had a chance to see this man who's now a woman In person, the physical build, the makeup, the look, the strength, all this other stuff, I can see it with my own eyes.  This person was a man pretty much with a wig on, with some feminine makeup and fingernails.  But everything else, this person's body looked like all the other male cyclist's bodies.  And then you go on and you look up the stats or whatever.  This person is dominating the women.  Got all the female records.  And this person was competing as a man before.  And these things are just, it's not fair.  It don't make sense.  And we live in a society where we overcorrect too much.  Like driving, when you learn how to drive, like a tactical driving in a police department, When you start to lose control, the reasoning or what you should do to overcome losing control is to be calm and give slight input.  Slight input, right?  You don't overcorrect.  Because when you overcorrect, you crash.  Everything is off.  You're sliding everywhere.  The car loses control.  So you put slight input to correct it.  When you see a phenomenon like men turning to women and now there's a sports correlation to it, You don't overcorrect.  You just put a little input in it.  Maybe you create an environment where they can compete.  Okay, that's a little input.  Then you realize that they're biologically different than the natural women.  So what you do is you put a little input and you give them maybe their own category.  You give them an asterisk beside their name so that people can understand that they're not actually women.  They're men who are now identifying as women.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  And when you see that women are getting pushed out of the sports and their records are being destroyed, then you can say, we made the tweak this a little bit.  You don't have to go full.  Your rights don't exist.  We don't care nothing about you.  These people who are feeling this way, they have complete authority over what everybody feels.  And so back to the subject at hand, I'm glad that... South Park did this video because I think it's relevant and necessary for our society to get this in our head that this is becoming a real problem and people have this visual subconscious understanding about this whole thing.  Not everybody.  Similar to what South Park put out.  Let me know in the comment sections what you think.  Am I tripping or be Tatum on or something, man?  Like and subscribe to the channel.
