Because even in 2015, there were people whinging, why are you still talking about feminists and SJWs and safe spaces and whatnot.  That stuff is so last year.  It's totally over and done with.  Because woke hipsters are just the shadow pawns of the virtue signals, folks.  It doesn't matter if this shit has been going on for a thousand years.  They got bored of talking about it after three weeks, so everyone else has just shut up and pretend it's not happening.  Cut to four years later, and it has got butt cake.  nothing but worse and worse and larger and heavier and dumber.  Why are we still talking about it?  Because you're still not fucking listening.  Come to the ICMI, folks, if you're interested in talking about what the hell to do about this shit, or even if you're just interested in listening.  It starts next weekend, from as I record this, 16th to 18th of August 2019.  And it's not too late to get your ticket, unless it is by the time I publish this, or sometime later, when you see it.
