            "text": "Hi, guys.  This is Jesus.  Jesus Christ has chosen this week to update.  Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I want to come to you to do a sort of an expose really on a very popular pastor which the Lord has brought up in my spirit about three to four weeks ago.  Now his name is Chris from Christ Embassy Church, a very huge church.  I think he's based, his headquarters is in Nigeria, if I'm not mistaken.  But it's a very, very, very, very massive church and he's got little churches of branches all over the world.  but i did a video on this man.  i think it was last year when the lord gave me a vision about him and i posted it.  i will try and find it and link it in the description box.  so when you have time you can go and see uh the vision that the lord gave me about this man uh christ oklahomans um and his church christ's embassy.  so i'll link it in the description box.  But brothers and sisters, I am telling you, God is not done.  God is not done with Africa because he is cleaning up the land.  And what you're going to find that's going to happen in the months and years to come is that these false prophets, the judgment of God is going to fall on them because they're not going to get away scot-free.  You cannot lead God's people astray.  And believe that everything would be okay.  Just because you do something wrong.  And the Lord don't strike you down.  At the same time.  You think that you've gotten away with it.  However God is merciful.  But judgment is coming upon the false prophets.  The false teachers.  The false preachers.  And those who abuse the pulpit.  to gain their popularity in the world.  So three weeks ago, the Lord spoke to me about this pastor, Chris Guy.  And when he spoke to me, I said, Lord, I've already done a video about him.  And it's on my YouTube somewhere.  But the Lord spoke very, very strongly, very, very strongly to me.  And he said to me, Chris operates in the spirit of Benny Hinn.  Now, when the Lord dropped that in my spirit three weeks ago, I said, okay, Lord, I didn't dismiss it.  I didn't question it.  The only thing that I said, Lord, I need some more information because all the Holy Spirit said to me is that this Chris Pastor, Chris guy, operates in the spirit of Benny Hinn.  I didn't go on YouTube.  I didn't research nothing.  I didn't read up nothing, nothing at all.  But I knew that somehow the Lord will finish the information because for me, my relationship with the Holy Spirit is very, very unique.  It does not overload me with information.  It doesn't work like that.  Since I've been in ministry with the spirit of the most high from 2015 until now, he has never, ever, ever overload my brain with information.  It doesn't work like that.  So I knew that somehow he will finish telling me what he needs to tell me so that I could do a video and release.  Because when he told me, Chris operates in the spirit of Benny Hinn.  That was all.  Brothers and sisters, about three days after or so, when the Lord told me that, I got an email from a brother in the Lord who lives in, I think it's Nigeria, somewhere like that he lives.  He emailed me and he said to me, Sister Kerrian, could you tell me if Pastor Chris from Christ's Embassy Church is a false prophet?  Because at the time I was exposing Bushiri, Java, Benny Hinn and all that.  So obviously he wanted to know if Pastor Chris from Christ's Embassy was a false prophet.  So when I started to read the email, I shook my head and I laughed in my spirit because I said, my God, three days ago, the Lord told me that this man operates in the spirit of Benny Hinn.  And as I continue to read this brother's email, brethren, I'm telling you, brothers and sisters, I was shocked.  The phone nearly fell out of my hands.  He went on to say, That Pastor Chris Ministries, the Christ Embassy Ministries and Benny Hinn Ministries worked together.  I could not believe it.  That was my confirmation that I needed.  This is what the brother was saying, that Chris from Christ Embassy and Benny Hinn Ministry both work together.  And I said, my God, this is some serious stuff.  And that is the reason why.  So I emailed him back and I said, you know, three days ago, the Lord showed me that this Chris guy, this Pastor Chris guy operates in the spirit of Benny Hinn, which is very, very dangerous.  You cannot... Have a ministry and operate in a man's spirit.  You need to move in the power of the Holy Spirit.  You need to move and maneuver in the power of the Holy Ghost.  Very, very dangerous position that man is in.  So that was that.  And I still didn't feel led to do a second video on this Chris guy.  Until a beautiful brother in the Lord, because I don't watch TV, I don't read the news or anything like that.  I just depend on the Holy Spirit really to show me things.  And a beautiful brother in the Lord were talking and he sent me a message.  And he said to me, Kerrian, have you heard?  And I said, heard what?  He said, Benny Hinn has gone to Pastor Chris Church and is begging for money.  And I thought, there you go again.  There you go.  There you go.  Because everybody thought that Benny Hinn repented from his prosperity gospel.  I knew he didn't repent.  It's very, very deep what the Lord showed me concerning Benny Hinn and why he came out, I think, in September time to denounce the prosperity gospel.  That wasn't a true... repentance of him because now he's gone back to his vomit.  okay preaching in in this chris.  uh and chris this pastor chris is um christ embassy church preaching and begging for more money basically preaching the prosperity gospel is going back to that brothers and sisters.  and then three days ago or two days ago a beautiful brother in the lord tagged me in one of his posts and he said karen look here.  so when i went over to the post brothers and sisters yeah Chris from Christ's Embassy Church, Pastor Chris, has now been investigated in the United Kingdom for fraud.  This thing is serious.  This man, his church, now has been investigated for all sorts of things.  Fraud, this, that, what have you.  The UK government is doing that.  So, when the Lord came to me and said he operates in the spirit of Benny Hinn and no no why?  the Holy Spirit told me that because this you see these pastors mimic each other and they pick up their spirit.  now Benny Hinn is well-known in the Christian circles.  a lot of pastor reverence him and respect him And wants to have the type of ministry, fake ministry that Benny has.  But they do not know where Benny Hinn gets his power from.  so i'm saying this to say that this chris guy a lot of you think that he's operating in the holy spirit that is anointed by the power of the most high.  he is not.  he is operating in the spirit of benehan.  so the same spirit that benehan operates in that's the same spirit this chris uh okiome guy is operating in.  and if you're underneath his ministries you need to come out you need to get off from his church you need to stop listening to him because i am telling you the judgment of god is about to fall on this false prophet.  you're going to hear people in the pulpit just fall down dead.  i am telling you this is serious.  this is the most highest time because god is waking up his people.  He's literally waking up his people from sleep.  And he doesn't want no interference.  And these people have been sent by Satan.  I am telling you brothers and sisters.  You've got to use the spirit of discernment.  This is night time.  This is time.  You cannot enter 2020 like this.  You cannot enter 2020 with... with just false prophecies and fake pastors and fake prophets in your heart.  You've got to debunk.  You've got to seek the Holy Spirit and listen to what the Lord is saying.  know so i just wanted to come because god is not done with africa.  he is.  you know i said africa because obviously this man is well known throughout the world but i'm just using africa because that's where his base is and that's where majority of it is at.  that's where the but that is where the headquarter is and obviously a lot of people listen to this man.  He's false.  He's a false teacher.  You need to get out from this Christ God ministry.  I am telling you, brothers and sisters, you're going to learn the hard way if you don't listen.  Take it to the Lord in prayer because I know that he's got a lot of fans and I know I might get a lot of comments.  On this post, people are going to be upset.  But I am telling you for your own good.  He is a false teacher.  He does not operate in the true Holy Spirit.  He operates in the spirit of Benny Hinn.  And Benny Hinn is a false prophet or false teacher.  Just like I said to you that... passion Java that he in that Benny Hinn initiates passion Java.  okay Benny Hinn initiates passion Java.  so you know be on your guard.  be be steadfast.  i love you.  come here.  sorry my little my little four-year-old is with me.  all right.  yeah you sure.  yeah yeah okay you must make any noise.  okay oh good boy.  um be on your guard.  brothers and sisters 2020 is going to be a rough year.  i will do another video before we enter 2020 but i do love you.  every time i do videos like this i get serious attack.  The last time I did a video on Bushiri, yeah, that was, that attack was.  That attack was deep.  That attack was so deep when I did that video on Bushiri.  So I know these are mega pastors.  They're in the Freemasonry.  They're protected by demonic entities.  So when you do a video about them and expose them, those demonics comes for you.  But I'm not scared.  I'm not scared at all.  Not one bit.  So, you know, take this to the Lord in prayer.  Chris Okiomi, whatever his surname is, from Christ Embassy Church, is a false teacher.  Get out from his ministry.  Okay?  So God eternally bless you.  I love you all.  And I will see you soon.  Someday in glory.  In Jesus' precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen.  Blessings. ",
