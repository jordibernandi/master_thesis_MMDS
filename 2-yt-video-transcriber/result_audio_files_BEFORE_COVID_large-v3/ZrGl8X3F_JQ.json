Now let me ask you, what do you think is the best news in the world?  What's the best news that I can tell you today?  Girls, what would be the best news you could hear today?  You won the lottery, okay?  That would be good news, yeah?  Many people say that.  I'm asking you, what would be some good news?  What would you say?  of all the stupid people like yourself who based their lives on stupid books written 2,000 years ago?  Okay, so this man here, thank you, what's your name?  Sorry, I'm Joe.  I'm Ashton.  Ashton says to me, thank you, I was asking what's the best news, and Ashton said the best news would be to get rid of all the stupid morons like myself that believe a fictional book.  Is that fair enough?  Yeah, so Ashton, can I ask you a question?  Why do you think it's a load of rubbish?  Why do you think the Bible's a load of rubbish?  Because it's full of things like, if I become poorly now in my own age, at seven or five, if I become poorly and my daughter that I live with wants to look after me, would you suggest that what's in your good book would be a good treatment for me if I was caught?  You were cold.  Cold.  Black King Dave.  Sorry, those who are stopping, my friend Ashton, there's a lot of people listening.  He's saying, you know, the Bible's a load of rubbish.  Say you were sick, would you follow the Bible?  Now, you've heard of the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke.  No, you haven't answered my question.  Yeah, well, do you know what Luke was?  Luke's job was he was a physician, he was a doctor.  If you were sick, Ashton, I would send you to the doctors.  That's what I would do because the Bible teaches about doctors.  Yeah, but your Bible has a wonderful answer.  Okay, tell us this answer then, Ashton.  Okay, well, I wouldn't buy that, okay?  That's a different time.  Jesus said, in the beginning, there was male and female.  Marriage, that's what God believes. ",
