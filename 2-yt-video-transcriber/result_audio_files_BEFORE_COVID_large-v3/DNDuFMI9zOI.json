They make a big point over female modesty and how women can dress.  all right, but they can't be too fancy.  They can't be too pretty.  They can't be too... everything.  They make a really big deal out of this.  but now you're essentially asking men to do what women would go to hell for.  You want men to dress up fancy, you want them to not just have boring clothes.  It feels a little hypocritical.  And of course you're forgetting that in the Bible it's a sin to wear clothes of mixed fabrics.  so you are asking men to sin for you so you can find them attractive.  Probably gonna go to hell for that.

Is that he eventually stopped listening to me.  And he used to be such a good listener and he was so... sweet and kind and always like actively listened to what I was saying and it got to the point where that turned into just passive listening and then honestly ignoring me a lot of the time not listening to anything.  I was saying I'd open up about something important to me or ask him to do something and he just wouldn't listen an hour a day.  a week later he'd forget.  we'd even had the conversation and one time i was like trying to tell him how i felt about stuff and he was like kind of nodding along and i asked him to like repeat back something i said and he completely missed the main point of what i was talking about.  And I just felt if you don't respect me enough to listen when I'm opening up to you, then you don't respect me enough to build a life with me.  So that's one of the reasons I broke up with him after a while.  Like I gave him a lot of chances.  It wasn't just like one instant or anything.  But yeah, sorry, enough about that.

So the thing with this is that making jokes and stuff during a conversation can often be a coping mechanism when you don't know how to open up emotionally or you're scared to or you're worried.  It's not something to mock someone for or like criticize them for.  Yeah, you just need to help them feel safe and comfortable talking to you and opening up.  Because letting out your emotions with people is very difficult, especially new people.  You can feel very vulnerable doing it, and it's a scary thing.  It's not an easy thing to ask of someone.  So, yeah, sometimes people cope with that by making jokes or clamming up or pretending they don't feel something.  But don't shame them for it.  And it gets worse, because she goes on to say this. ",

You know, when they really get into it and they really get all emotional and they tell you about all the things that they know and that they've learned and what they love about it.  And, you know, you can just kind of see them light up inside.  I love hearing people talk about that kind of stuff.  And I would never, ever put someone down for being passionate about something that I wasn't passionate about myself.  I get with these two, religion is like the main focus of their lives and it's something they really care about.

While I'm an atheist myself, I honestly think if people want to be religious, they can be and they should be.  And that religion should be something that adds to your life.  not detracting from anything else, not taking over anything else, not replacing anything else.  Human beings are so amazing because together we all have so many like interesting skills and passions and things we care about and areas of expertise and knowledge.  And one of the most fun parts of life I find is meeting people from completely different backgrounds to me with completely different experiences who love completely different things and learning from them.  and sharing what I know with them and they share stuff with me.  And that's how you learn and grow as a person and as a society, from learning from people so different than you.  I just, I can't imagine wanting to spend my time with people who are only interested in the exact same things as me.  As they ask for this to happen, it's so bizarre because they're creating a really tiny, really specific kind of echo chamber.  And I just don't think that can be healthy or fun.  And honestly, I don't think it's really realistic.  to ask that people are only interested in the stuff that you're interested in.  It's weird.  Anyway, so there we go.  That is what Morgan and her sister find unattractive in men.  I find it kind of bizarre to be honest.  From a personal standpoint, as a woman and an atheist, I would say the main unattractive things are mostly like rudeness and meanness and being unkind, poor personal hygiene.  I'm gonna go with the bad listener thing.  That's definitely unattractive. ",
