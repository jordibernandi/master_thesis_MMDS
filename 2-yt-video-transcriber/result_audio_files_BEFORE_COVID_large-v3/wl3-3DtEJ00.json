            "text": "Thank you.  So as many of you are aware by now, due to my argument with Logix, none other than King Crocoduck jumped in to defend his honour, and what followed was a truly shitty comparison between trans people and wanting to be an amputee of the seafaring variety, and whilst I could waste my time pulling apart what was stated there, something more important came up.  Namely, two case studies.  The first is a case I'm all too familiar with.  It's one of the case studies used in Psychology class to warn us what can happen if we let what we want to see blind us to what we actually observe.  People can die, sometimes after a lifetime of torture and betrayal, and I wish I was exaggerating.  I speak, of course, about the case of David Rima.  The second is that of Luna Damanjunga.  Now, oddly enough, only one of these people are trans and have any actual relevance to the conversation about trans people, trans children in particular, and that's Luna, so I want to focus on her case for now, but I will cover David Rima in an upcoming video.  Now, the reason I want to cover Luna's case first isn't just the fact that it's actually relevant.  There's also the fact that said child is not only currently alive, but both her and her mother find themselves being targeted by both conservative Christians and fascists.  And no, that's not hyperbole, as I'll evidence in a moment.  The case involves two divorced parents from Dallas, Texas, and their twin children, one of whom has come out as transgender.  The father is Jeffrey Daman-Younger, and the mother, Dr.  Anne Gurgals.  Now, the relevance of Anne's degree is the fact that she is not only a practising paediatrician with a relevant medical degree, she is also certified under the American Board of Paediatrics.  And to say her actions in this have been outstanding would be a vast understatement.  When the divorce first went ahead, she gained majority custody, including full medical custody, of both children.  Yet she understood that there would be disputes over various aspects of Luna's gender, so she put in the request for an amicus attorney.  For those of you who don't know, an amicus attorney is a court-assigned attorney who will obtain relevant documents for court proceedings, they will conduct interviews with the child and the surrounding people such as doctors, friends and family, they will communicate the child's desires without undue parental influence directly to the court, and lastly, they will sign or refuse to sign any parental pleadings on the basis of said information, all of which is done to ensure that the child receives the best quality of care.  And she didn't need to do this, but she did, and the parents were subsequently signed an amicus attorney by the court.  On top of this, Dr.  Anne Gurgels has also done everything in her power to try and get Mr.  Younger involved with the child's paediatrician.  When the issue first arose, Dr.  Anne Gurgels started sending her daughter to a paediatrician they knew through their career, but when Mr.  Younger raised issue with this over potential bias, doctor-uncle gals changed to a paediatrician.  she had no prior history with, again, something she didn't need to do since she has full medical custody of the child.  And all this information can be found on page 23 of the July 10th, 2018 court proceedings.  She actively chose to try and build bridges with the father to try and bring them around and accept their daughter for who she is.  Meanwhile, Mr Younger has taken to recruiting conservative Christians with the desire to torture the trans out of his daughter, and neo-Nazis to harass his ex-wife.  Dr Ungergauz just refuses to talk about her daughter's private information publicly.  As a result, all of the articles I found on the matter are reporting solely from the father's perspective.  and has complete respect for her daughter's privacy, so much that she even attempted to seal off proceedings from public due to harassment.  Everything I've said so far has come from the court transcripts which Mr Young has made publicly available, much to his detriment since they do not portray his actions in a good light.  Now, the story broke headlines in The Federalist in an article written by Walt Heyer.  If you are unfamiliar with Walt Heyer, he's a conservative Christian preacher who advocates the fairly horrific and entirely pseudoscientific process, sometimes referred to as conversion or reparative therapy, specifically of trans children.  The facts, it's akin to torture.  Now, Heyer's gimmick is that he's one of the very few instances of people who seem to have genuine regrets about their transition, something which has allowed him to fill the same role in the Christian ministries as ex-gay preachers.  Now, Why do I say genuine regret?  Well, when I say gender transition regret, people often jump to the conclusion that I'm talking about a person who thought they were trans and later discovered otherwise.  And whilst that would be arguable for Haier himself, the truth for many of the cases he has stolen and edited to fit his narrative before hosting them on his website is a little more complicated.  As an amazing investigatory piece by Zinnia Jones found out, there are many reasons a person may regret transition which lay outside of discovering that they were not trans.  In fact, many of the cases he references don't even qualify as having regret.  Some people who medically but not socially detransition still hold the experience to be something which helped them come to peace with themselves.  But the fact is, Meyer has carved an industry for himself by selling fears about transitional regret which are not factually based and actually run counter to what the scientific consensus tells us.  All of which is, again, covered in Zinnia's video, so be sure to check that out, either now or when you're done here.  So when Walt Heye wrote an article on the matter, we should be aware of this history and approach said story with caution.  We are dealing with an anti-LGBT plus minister who has a known history of editing stories to meet his narrative.  Now, following the original article published by The Federalist, these are the only news sites, and I say that loosely, to have covered the matter.  The Daily Wire, Breitbart News, Christian Post, Christian Examiner, Russia Today, World News Group, The New American, The Federalist , The Blaze, and The Daily Wire .  All of these are far-right Christian or fascist publishers, all of which are using the case of Luna Younger to whip up a trans panic, something King Crocoduck has thoroughly bought into without a hint of scrutiny.  Instead, King Crocoduck is trusting the man who violated not only the will of his daughter, but court orders him forcefully cutting her hair as an attempt to shut her up about being a girl.  For further clarification, the court had ordered that both parents would have to contact their assigned amicus attorney when considering a haircut for Luna.  Now, I couldn't find the original order, but I found it stated once again in the official documents after the order had been breached as stating, quote, Parties must obtain permission of the amicus attorney and follow the instructions of the amicus attorney regarding haircuts for the  child.\".  And to be clear that this already existed in some form, when Mr Younger showed a flippant disregard for the court order, pretending like he just misinterpreted it, the judge stated, and I do quote, Okay, first of all, you do have to get permission of the amicus attorney to cut the child's hair.  That's verbatim in the order.  That's a violation of the order for you to cut the child's hair without the permission of the amicus attorney.  Don't do it  again.\".  So whilst I don't have the original order, I am assuming that they're the same or at least near identical from the statements laid out by the judge.  Again, I'm having to work with what I have access  to.\".  Now, the hearing was not just about the hair, but also Mr Younger's actions following that breach of what the court had ordered.  Namely, whilst talking to his daughter over FaceTime, he attempted to fish a response from her about the haircut.  Luna froze and went silent for a couple of minutes before her mother stepped in to end the situation.  Luna has suffered clear distress as a result of Mr.  Younger's actions, distress he seeks to maintain.  Jeff was also blocked from holding custody during all teacher-parent conferences or similar meetings following said hearing, the reason being that he clearly had the intent of going to said school to actively misgender his child, is solely referred to as a girl by the name of Luna.  Dr.  Angel Giles had been willing to allow Mr.  Younger to attend if he were willing to use Luna's proper name and pronouns.  Mr.  Younger has shown no such intent.  It was also noted that Mr.  Younger had attended no prior school meetings for either of his children, and that it seemed to be another means of attack against his ex-wife, one which ignored the likely harm that such an action would cause Luna.  Mr Younger shows a desire to hurt his ex-wife at any cost, even at the expense of his own child's wellbeing, and the courts concurred.  As well as restating the order on haircuts, the court ordered that quote.  If a school activity for the children is scheduled on a Thursday night, father's possession on that Thursday night is abated.  In lieu of the Thursday night possession, Father is to have possession of the children from 6pm to 8pm on the Wednesday that is the day before Thursday on which the school activity is scheduled.  Mother must give father 14 days' notice of every instance where a school activity will occur on a Thursday night.  This order does not affect the right of father to attend the school activity on the Thursday  night.\".  End quote.  So again, the father is still allowed to attend alongside the mother, but the court sees his intent to be potentially harmful towards the child, and therefore won't allow him to do so on his own.  And that's really the whole situation thus far.  There was a use of force investigated by the police, but Mr Younger was later acquitted.  The details of that I do not know, since, oddly enough, those transcripts haven't been uploaded, so I don't know the grounds upon which they were acquitted, and I can't really comment on that.  What I can comment on, however, is their appalling behaviour towards their daughter.  Since their meeting with Walt Heyer, they've taken to setting up a website, promoting much of the dishonesty that people such as King Crocoduck seem to have bought into alongside pictures of their child in seemingly male-coded attire.  And the goal of this is rather clear.  They want to create an association between the child's clothing and their gender.  Clothing which, by the way, doesn't actually impact their gender.  Just like many cis girls can and do reject female-coded attire, so do some trans girls.  But there's also the fact that this child has been harmed by their father.  The hair is just one example.  Like a bad case of clich\u00e9, the father keeps demanding that they continue certain sports to try and turn them into a man, and the child is picking up on that.  So is it unreasonable to consider the fact that the child prefers to just do what their father says on the days he has custody, only to return to normality when she's back with her mother?  Well, the evidence would seem to suggest that.  Mr.  Younger claims he doesn't force his child to do anything, but the active avoidance of the amicus attorney paints a very different picture.  But now we come to the question of the video.  Has Luna Younger been scheduled to start puberty blockers when she becomes eight years of age, as King Crocoduck proclaimed?  No.  See pages 26 and 71.  That's when assessment of future options, including puberty blockers as well as hormone monitoring, begins.  Which is not the same thing.  It's the gathering of information to make a better informed choice in the future, not actually acting on it right then.  Puberty blockers in trans children are typically used somewhere during Tanner Stages 2-3, and whilst it's true that the lower end of this range for a typical person is 9 years of age, the vast majority of children are much older when they're put on them.  The number often thrown around by critics is usually 12 years of age.  But I don't know where that comes from.  In the study I just referenced, the average was actually somewhat higher.  The average for assigned boys was 14 years of age, and for assigned girls, it was 15 years of age.  However, in this case, they are taking a proactive approach.  They're not simply sitting around until the child comes to them after years of dysphoria.  they're getting ready to intervene at the first clear indication that this is the correct path for said child, so they'll likely start a little earlier.  Now, will they start at 8?  not likely.  That is, unless the child suffers precocious puberty, in which case puberty blockers are already the go-to response for that as well.  But all of this is pretty irrelevant since puberty blockers are clinically trialled and fully reversible, a fact that King Crocoduck just couldn't wrap his head around, as evidenced by his desperate attempts to quote Wikipedia as an argument.  Now, sadly, all I could grab was the response to his wiki quote due to the fact that they closed their Twitter account to scrub away the evidence of their misdeeds, such as this.  But I think the context is very clear, and it's true.  Some physicians have raised possible concerns about puberty blockers, Not one of which has actually been substantiated.  in all the years they've been using puberty blockers for cis children going through precocious puberty, and potentially trans children, to give them more time.  There's just no evidence to support that fear.  That's why people like Mr Younger turn to publishers such as the New Atlantis.  For those not familiar with The New Atlantis, they are to medical journals what the Creation Research Institute is to cosmology, geology, and evolutionary biology.  The people who publish in The New Atlantis do so since they find themselves unable to get through the peer review process to be published in a recognised medical journal.  It's pseudoscience 101. publish your wild claims with scientific jargon.  that will fail to convince the scientific community, but is good enough for your average buyer.  In this case, the aforementioned conservative Christians and fascists.  and that's all they have.  So, not only is the child not scheduled to start puberty blockers at age 8, the science on the matter is pretty clear.  There's no known negative effects of puberty suppression.  All it does is delay the process, offering the child, then teenager, more time to work with trained specialists to reach a decision on whether to begin HRT.  typically around the age of 16.  When said blockers are removed, whatever hormones are in the system will take their course.  That's whether it be the body's own hormones or those sourced through medical means.  So I hope this review of the Luna Damon Younger case reveals the true nature of the situation.  Please, if you see this case being thrown out there as an attack on the trans community, feel free to respond with either this video or the information supplied within.  All references can typically be found in the description, yet due to character limits, that's sometimes not possible.  In that case, they can always be found in the transcript and the pinned comment.  But I need to note this.  When we have members of the secular community.  turning to conservative Christian and fascist sources for ammunition against trans people, which were the only sources available to King Crocoduck at the time, That review was a deep problem needing addressing.  But what do you lot think?  Did King Crocodux screw up royally in throwing said case out there?  Should potential concerns overrule all available evidence surrounding certain medications, as seems to be the argument?  Why do so many people pretend to care about their child's wellbeing, only to subject them to hostile domestic environments?  Has Dr.  Angorgao's done the right thing for a child in not speaking publicly on the matter?  Did I miss something you lot noticed?  If so, be sure to leave us a comment down below.
