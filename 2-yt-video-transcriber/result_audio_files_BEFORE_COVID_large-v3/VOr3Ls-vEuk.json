            "text": "Hi everyone.  Also while I was out of town, I'm sorry, I'm really behind on things here.  I should have responded immediately, but I've been out of town.  Ken Ham tweeted some stuff that I feel like addressing.  And this was in response to the In No God We Trust protest that was held by some atheists in America.  Ken Ham tweeted this.  This is what we observe regarding such atheists.  One, their main message is always negative.  They're usually against something and their main emphasis is to be against Christianity.  Well, that's because in America it's Christianity that's being shoved down their throats.  Now, I tend to sympathize with them because I am also an atheist and I wouldn't want Christianity shoved down my throat.  Well, it's not so bad in Sweden, but it does happen that I come across people in the street who want to tell me the good news about Jesus and I really don't want them to be in charge of deciding what the law should say, for example.  Of course, if Christianity is the main religion being shoved down people's throats, Christianity is going to get the brunt of the protests.  They are going to be our primary target, if you will.  Christians, if you have a problem with this, If you have a problem with atheists protesting your religion over any other, here's what I think you should do.  You should practice religion in private among nothing but consenting adults.  Because what consenting adults do in private, it's none of my business.  I don't care.  I don't care if you have gay S&M orgies or if you practice Christianity.  I don't care.  I can have an opinion about it, but it's none of my business.  In fact, they're obsessed with being against anything Christian, and that's because it's a spiritual issue.  It's not a spiritual issue.  First of all, I... I can't say I really know what that means.  It's such a vague term that I'm not sure I would know a spiritual issue when I saw one.  But what I can tell you is that it's a scientific and philosophical issue, because if we're talking about the God of a fundamentalist type of Christianity, the God of a literal interpretation of the Bible, then it is actually a fact that that God does not exist.  At least as far as anyone can tell, and that includes you.  So we are factually right.  It's also a moral, social, and political issue because Christianity is being used to dictate policy and determine what the law should say.  We're talking about laws that actually hurt people like the anti-abortion laws in parts of America that were recently passed.  They're shaking their fists at our Creator, God, and Savior.  No, you are the ones shoving your demonstrably false beliefs down our throats.  Not your God.  Your God doesn't exist.  Two, they claim to be against religion, but what they mean is that they want their religion of atheism, their blind faith that life arose by natural processes, and their belief that there is no God forced onto the culture.  Okay, atheism has nothing to do with the belief that life arose by natural processes.  Also, most people who identify as atheists, in fact, all of them that I have ever come across, define atheism not as the belief that there is no God, but as the lack of belief in a God.  I think the belief that there are no gods is unjustified because so many gods are defined in ways that are unfalsifiable.  However, it is perfectly justified to believe that your god doesn't exist because, well, for one, He's defined in a way that is logically incoherent.  Omnipotence is logically incoherent.  Then you have the problem of evil or the problem of suffering, if you prefer, which you can't get around by saying, oh, free will, because there are things like natural disasters.  There are diseases, you know, stuff like that.  So you can't blame it on free will.  which is a completely different can of worms.  But then you have things like the fact that your God, according to the book you believe is his word, which is absolutely true.  Well, your God created the world 6,000 years ago, and yet the world has been around for a lot more than 6,000 years.  So your God contradicts what we observe in reality as well.  So we are justified in saying that your God doesn't exist.  But in order to be an atheist you simply need to not believe in a god.  At least that's how every atheist I have ever come across defines the term.  Well, what does it actually teach?  Because last time I checked it could be interpreted to teach absolutely anything.  I mean, just for one, does God love everyone or does God hate fags?  Just, we can start there.  Because the Bible says both.  Four.  When they state, in no God we trust, they're actually saying the God they trust in is the God of self.  That's their religion.  They often use terms like right, wrong, good, bad, etc.  But they have no absolute basis to use such terms.  Their meaning is relative, subjective, determined by the person who decides the meanings for them.  We actually have the closest thing there is to an absolute objective sense of morality.  And that's because we look at the consequences of our actions, both short-term and long-term, and decide whether an action is good or bad as measured by how those consequences are desirable or not.  You, on the other hand, have a sense of morality that is based on, this is what God has declared.  It's either divine command or it's God has, God is simply reporting what actual morality is.  And either way, it's completely subjective.  It has nothing to do with the consequences of actions which are, by the way, objective.  It's just, here's what God wants.  Or rather, here's what the people who made God up want.  Or here's what you get out of your interpretation of reading what the people who made God up want.  How is that any more absolute than our standard?  Our standard works.  Yours doesn't.  Shut up.  Five.  They don't understand science and confuse beliefs like origins with operational science that builds technology.  We don't understand science.  We at least know that there's no distinction between the science that studies the past and the science that builds technology.  It's the same method.  Theory.  Use a theory to construct a hypothesis.  Make a prediction using that hypothesis.  Test that prediction.  If that is correct, modify the theory accordingly.  If it is false, go back, modify the hypothesis.  Until you get something that is correct, modify the theory accordingly.  That's how we learn about observable reality.  Whether we're talking about learning about what happened in the past, or learning about how to build a particular type of machine.  Same method.  We understand that.  You don't.  You're the one who doesn't understand science, Ken.  6.  Most don't really know what they believe or why, as usually they just regurgitate what they've heard.  I can't speak for atheists in general, but I certainly know what I believe and why, and I only regurgitate things that I accept for good reason.  Also... Projection Overload!  7.  They often use personal attacks against Christians, which is what happens when one doesn't have logical arguments for one's position.  Well, we do use personal attacks on occasion, you idiot, because sometimes that's actually justified.  But you really need to learn the difference between an ad hominem and a rebuttal plus an insult.  8.  They inconsistently borrow from the Christian worldview when using logic and accepting the laws of nature, etc.  Interesting that Matthew 19, 26 says, with God, all things are possible.  Meaning that you can't, if you're going to take the Bible literally, that is, you can't make any predictions at all.  That means you can't have laws of nature in your worldview.  On the other hand, we can because we understand, unlike you, that the laws of nature are simply our descriptions of how nature appears to work in a consistent manner.  Logic?  Well, that's just a bunch of definitions that we've come up with, definitions and axioms that we've come up with in order to create rules for how to structure arguments.  Whether we're talking about structuring arguments, or whether we're talking about describing observable reality, this has nothing to do with Christianity.  9.  They can subjectively decide whatever they believe is purpose and meaning for them while alive, but ultimately they're preaching a religion of utter purposeless and meaninglessness.  Become an atheist, when you die you're done and you won't know you ever existed.  What a wonderful positive message they have for the world.  But this is the message atheists and everyone need to hear and understand.  It's not in atheism that there is no afterlife.  Atheism doesn't address the issue of an afterlife.  It's in reality.  See, we understand that life is a bunch of chemical processes, and death is the termination of those processes.  A process does not continue after it has terminated.  That's what termination refers to.  You are a bunch of chemical processes, and when those chemical processes end, there is no more you.  Whether you think this is a positive message or not is completely irrelevant.  It is the truth as best as anyone can know.  It is what everything indicates.  And there is nothing pointing in any other direction except for a bunch of wishful thinking.  Wishful thinking made up by people who didn't even know that life was a bunch of chemical processes.  See, when we learn things, we update our understanding.  You guys don't.  That's a bit of a problem for you.  But you know what?  I think it is a positive message.  This is it.  So make the best of it.  Be a decent human being.  Don't shove false beliefs down other people's throats.  Don't judge people based on arbitrary, silly things that ultimately don't matter to anyone other than them.  This is other people's only life as well.  So help make the best of it for them as well.  Be a decent person.  That's what I get out of it.  What's your message?  Be as big of a jerk as you can.  Be judgmental.  Be a complete and utter asshole to everyone who isn't part of your little tribe of people who have chosen this particular interpretation of this particular religion.  Be as big an asshole as possible.  And then when you die, you'll be rewarded afterwards.  And the reward is that you will get to laugh at all of those who made other choices.  How is that a positive message?  We have the positive message, Ken.  You have a shit message.  A shit message that also happens to be completely false.  See ya. ",
