            "text": "Why does the Bible say the fire is everlasting if the wicked are destroyed?  It's time to unlearn the lies.  Hey, welcome to Unlearned.  My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we unlearn the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  Now let's get started.  We already spoke about the Great White Throne Judgment, but I want to take a look at the second death and the eternal fire that will consume the wicked.  The Bible teaches that God is a just God who makes righteous judgments, which is why it's important for us to have an accurate understanding about the punishment of the wicked, because we don't want to believe lies about the Almighty.  Many people are confused about the punishment of the wicked in the lake of fire.  They seem to think that the wicked are going to be tortured for eternity.  But the Bible says the wicked will be destroyed in the fire.  So why does the Bible say the fire is everlasting if the wicked are destroyed?  The fire is eternal because it was not created for mortals, it was created for Satan and other fallen angels.  Then he will also say to those on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  Satan and other fallen angels are not mortal.  They are heavenly beings and the Bible says they will be tormented for eternity.  The devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night, forever and ever.  It's important to note that when Satan, the beast, and the false prophet are cast into the lake of fire, there is no mention of their death.  The Bible is very specific when it mentions those three who will be tormented forever.  while there is no mention of anyone else receiving such torment.  Unlike the devil and his angels, humans will not be able to endure the eternal flames.  When a mortal is cast into the lake of fire, they will die, which is why the Bible calls it the second death.  But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexual immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.  The Bible also tells us that Sodom and Gomorrah suffered the vengeance of eternal fire, but we know for a fact that they are not still burning to this day.  As Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.  If eternal fire means the fire never stops and those in the fire never stop burning, that would require Sodom and Gomorrah to still be on fire today.  Yet we know they were destroyed by the fire and remain destroyed to this day, never to return.  This is what Jude was talking about when he said they suffered the vengeance of eternal fire.  The Bible makes it clear that the lake of fire is a place of punishment for the wicked.  and that we should make every effort to avoid it at all costs.  Yeshua taught that it's better to pluck out your eye or to cut off your hand than to have your whole body thrown into the fire of Gehenna.  If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you.  For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.  And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you.  For it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.  Notice that Yeshua said your whole body would be cast into Gehenna, indicating that it's a bodily destruction.  Likewise, He indicates in another place that both the body and the soul will be destroyed in the fire of Gehenna.  And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul, but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.  This is significant because it shows that the soul is not kept alive in an eternal state of torture separate from the body, as many people seem to teach.  but the soul is actually destroyed by the fire.  This is why the lake of fire is referred to as the second death, because the scriptures teach that the soul who sins shall die.  I've had minor burns on my skin over the years, and although they are only minor, they are extremely painful, and I can't even imagine how terrible it would be to have your entire body burning to death in fire.  I wouldn't want to suffer one second in a fire like that, and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone else either.  That's why I'm so thankful that God is so gracious that He didn't allow humans to become immortal in their sin, so that they will find grace even in their punishment.
