            "text": "The Bible to this day is the most read, the most bought and the most distributed book in the whole world.  His popularity still by far surpasses any other novel in existence.  But with all the translations, is it perfect?  Was Satan over the centuries able to corrupt some of the verses?  Well here are the top 5 verses that have some serious problems.  Let's have a look.  1.  To be born from above.  Throughout Christ's ministry, he mentions several times of being from above, and telling his critics that they are from beneath.  However, in John 3.3, that born from above was instead translated as born again, and here is a much better translation.  This corruption has spawned an entire doctrine of people believing that they must be born-again Christians.  The Greek word used here is anoven, which is an adverb which describes a direction.  The opposite adverb is from below.  In Strong's concordance we have the meaning from above, from a higher place, of frings which come from heaven or God.  from the first from the beginning from the very first.  only with the King James Bible was the further translation again suddenly added in and there is no other place in scripture where it could or should be translated as again or in any other contemporary Greek writings where it must be interpreted to mean again What Christ means is that Adam was created by God.  His origin is from God.  He is from above.  If you descend from Adam, like Christ, you are from above.  When the fallen angels mixed with every animal producing monsters and giants, these offspring were corruptions.  God never created them and therefore they were from beneath.  In Judea there were the real Israelites who generally accepted Christ and there were these Edomite Canaanites who pretended to be Israelites but were not and they never accepted Christ.  These were the offspring of Adamites who had married and mingled with the descendants of Cain and the Rephaim.  They are the seed of the serpent and the Genesis 3.15 war is still very true to this day.  Since only Adam was given the Spirit of God, if you don't descend from adam you don't have this spirit and this is why christ distinguishes between the two.  number two christ's own people.  when christ god himself came in the flesh to save israel to save his people one of the first verses in john's gospel seems to indicate that they rejected him making it out as though god was a complete failure.  if he can't even convince his own people then how can you ever rely on god?  John 1.11 indicates that his own received him not, but under a correct translation, what it really says is the men of the country received him not.  To understand this, we must understand the history of Judea around the time of Christ.  When the Judeans returned to Judea from captivity in Babylon, other people had moved in, most notably the Edomites.  and as we talked about earlier they were descendants of the fallen angels.  around 200 BC the Israelites rose up under the leadership the Maccabee brothers.  unfortunately they began conquering the surrounding cities and forcefully converted many of these Edomites.  from then on these Edomites would also be recognized as Judeans.  now around a hundred years later those Edomites managed to seize power and overthrew the Maccabees.  And this is how Herod the Great came to rule over Judea.  He was not an Israelite, but an Edomite, and he put all his people into high positions, taking over the priesthood.  Generally, the south of Judea had a lot of Edomites, whilst the north, Galilee, was mostly just real Israelite Judahites.  and this is why whenever christ travelled into judea he was suddenly met with hostile opposition with people who rejected him.  of course the edomites rejected christ.  they hated him whilst the majority of the israelites always accepted him.  As Christ put it.  in simple words, my sheep hear my voice and they follow me, the real Israelites.  But you do not believe me, because you are not my sheep.  They were Edomites.  3.  The Unclean.  Some mistranslations are so subtle they are hard to spot.  Numerous times in the Old Testament it is commanded that the Israelites remain a separate nation.  That commandment still exists to separate from the unclean.  In 2 Corinthians 6 and 11, the word thing was added on after, which implies that it's specifying an object, like say an idol, an unclean thing.  But it's not, it's talking about people.  It's telling us to stay away from the impure, and only then will God admit us away from the unclean.  Those being once again the descendants of the fallen angels, we should have nothing to do with them.  We are commanded by God to separate from them.  And this is why today we have lost control of our nations.  We are ruled over by banks and we have little to no power over our own governments.  To change this, first we must repent, separate, and only then will God hear us.  Number four, Christianity is not for everybody.  Paul wrote many letters to the European nations explaining Christianity and the new covenant.  In one of those to the Thessalonians, unfortunately, it's generally translated, all men have not faith.  implying that not everyone accepts christianity which is true but the real meaning gives a different context since the faith is not for all.  this shows that some people you should never even try to convert.  paul is referring once again to the descendants of those fallen angels.  They don't descend from Adam, and Christ only came for Adamkind.  Furthermore, the gospel, the good message, is only for the children of Israel.  5.  The Anointed Nation.  Over and over again in the Old Testament, God repeats that He will save Israel and He will redeem them.  Since they had gone into adultery and turned their backs on their husband, God, they were liable to the death penalty.  that was the law.  the only way out of this was for God himself to come as a man and die to release his bride Israel from the penalty of death and also so that he could remarry them in the supper of the lamb.  this understanding has become completely corrupted where instead we are taught that Christ died for everyone and if you just believe in Christ suddenly you become the anointed people.  Paul explains in many of his letters that the promises to Abraham never ended and the Israelites are still his people even to this day.  what most people don't understand is that they dispersed into Europe and the Europeans are the Israelites.  in Galatians 3 16 implies that the seed is Christ but it should read that to you your offspring speaking to Abraham which are anointed.  This is why all of Europe accepted Christianity.  They are the same people as in the Old Testament and still are anointed whether they realize it or not.  Thanks for watching.  There's a few more videos coming up showing you what they've done with the Bible.  Praise Yahweh and hail Yahshua Christ. ",
