            "text": "Let me start here.  Here's this freshman congresswoman that no one is willing to look into.  There is an electric fence around here.  You cannot talk about her.  But when I said to my staff, I want to really look into her and I want to see \u2013 tell me who she is.  Tell me where she came from, et cetera, et cetera.  We started uncovering things that are just beyond description strange.  There are multiple, multiple suspicious stories that \u2013 The media has granted her a pass, and they would never grant this pass to anyone.  I mean, even the average Democrat would not get away with these things.  So I want to talk to you a little bit about her and where she came from today.  We'll talk about her anti-Semitism and the heart of that on tomorrow's episode at this time.  Now... the first stories that started to come out to question her came out from online bloggers back in two thousand sixteen.  normally i wouldn't go to an online blogger and say hey look at what this online blogger did.  however when you have no media sometimes the online bloggers if you check them out have something, and they have checked this out.  Back in 2016, Ilhan Omar had committed immigration fraud.  This was the charge, that she had committed immigration fraud by marrying her brother to facilitate his arrival in the United States.  Okay, all right.  If it was from a blogger, I would look into it, but it doesn't help that, you know, it's like, okay, really?  So she set her social media platforms to private immediately after that story broke and then deleted all of the alleged evidence that was used to prove the immigration fraud case.  It was all up on her social media.  And as soon as that came out, delete.  OK, sounds suspicious, but the mainstream media wouldn't touch it.  Not even the local Minnesota media would touch it.  And you'll understand why by the end of this episode tomorrow.  The Associated Press actually took this on.  They were the only outlet, the Associated Press, not a slum out vet and currently not a conservative outlet, to say the least.  But when they asked Omar what was going on, she just said, quote, I choose not to further the narrative of those who oppose us, end quote.  OK, well, I assume that you're saying that those are all lies, but it would be easy to prove them.  So the AP asked Omar for her immigration records and birth certificates.  that would prove her denial.  Now, when I first saw this, I was like, oh, geez, a birth certificate thing.  There was nothing with the Obama birth certificate.  Can we stop with the birth certificates?  And the fact that she said that her family's birth certificates were lost during the Somali civil war, something that probably did happen and was true.  So you're not going to base it on birth records.  However, the immigration records, the things that should be open, you shouldn't have a problem with this at all.  She refused to offer any of those up and a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by the Associated Press was sent back explaining the approval of the release had to be authorized by Omar and her husband and they won't sign off.  Now, even Snopes, who's not really in the Donald Trump camp.  classifying this not as true or false but unproven.  So let's recap.  We have a credible case of immigration fraud by a U.S.  representative, and the alleged perpetrator has deleted the visual evidence, refuses to provide any evidence, the person who is under the microscope.  She's gone radio silent on this issue ever since, and no one is looking into it.  Okay, I mean, you'd think that someone would, you know, at the New York Times or Washington Post at least be curious.  Why wouldn't the government open a probe?  The Associated Press, according to the Associated Press, the Obama administration never started an investigation, and the Trump administration hasn't started an investigation.  Okay.  What else you got?  Well, there's also evidence that Ilhan Omar committed perjury in court.  Now, this is where it starts to fall into place.  When she filed for a divorce from her possible brother in 2017, Omar claimed that she hadn't seen or made contact with her husband since 2011.  She said, I don't even know where my husband is or where he was.  It's possible he was somewhere in London.  Well, PJ Media went to the Minnesota Family Records Center, and they verified that Omar officially submitted to the court that her last contact with her husband was June 2011.  So remember this.  She said, I haven't seen him since June 2011, and that's in her divorce records.  So in the absence of any journalist doing any work on this at all, The internet sleuths had to go to work, and they searched Omar's husband's last known location, which was London, right?  She said, I haven't seen him, probably in London.  So they searched to see if Omar had traveled there between 2011 and 2016.  Oops!  They found some photos on social media, taken in London back in 2014.  The picture is up on the screen now if you happen to be watching.  It is taken in 2014.  That's Ilyan Omar and her ex-husband or brother or whatever.  So isn't that a pretty strong case for perjury?  Case for law enforcement at least to investigate the mainstream media to do some kind of looking into this.  Give credit to the Associated Press.  They're the only ones that at least ask Omar about this discrepancy.  And she refused to address the situation.  And Omar's husband, ex-husband, has declined any kind of response either.  And by the way, the pictures, yeah, they're mysteriously been deleted.  Now, there's one other thing.  Omar has been accused by state representative Steve Dreskowski of of not one but three campaign finance and ethics violations.  The first allegation involves the use of $3,000 in campaign money that was spent on travel to Estonia and Boston.  Now, Drakowski claims that these trips were personal in nature.  And her response?  It should be concerning to his constituents that he's using taxpayer dollars to harass a Muslim candidate.  So in other words, her defense is, I'm a Muslim.  The second allegation is that Omar used over $2,000 in campaign finance to pay her lawyer for her divorce proceedings.  Omar's response was basically, no, no, it was for something else.  And no other explanation has been given.  The third allegation is that she made ethics violations after accepting speaker fees from public colleges.  Omar would later pay that money back, but... No apology?  No, instead we got this.  We recognize how these folks are deeply invested in stopping a progressive, black, Muslim, hijab-wearing, immigrant woman.  Boy, intersectionality is working for her. ",
