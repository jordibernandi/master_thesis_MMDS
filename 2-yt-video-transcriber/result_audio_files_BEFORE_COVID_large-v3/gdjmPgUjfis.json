I have morals.  You know, I know that you can't kill your neighbor over small arguments type, you know, like you can't kill your neighbor at all.  You know, it's like, I, I know there's right and wrong in the world.  And I do feel like I have purpose.  Like, for whatever reason i absorb information about ancient life i can talk about it literally all day ask my friends ask my family like i could go on and on and on and on and on and on and so that's like basically all i've done in my career is studied ancient life studying fossils studying the progression of life and so that to me is my purpose.  like For whatever reason, my brain understands ancient life and I have no problem with deep time.  It doesn't freak me out.  And so like that to me is a purpose.  Like I'm doing what I feel like I was meant to do, you know, and I try to donate to charities.  You know, I'm trying to be a good person.  Thank you. ",
