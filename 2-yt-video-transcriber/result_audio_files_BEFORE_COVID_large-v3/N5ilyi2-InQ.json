For all their outrage over SJWs having cuckgasms on college campuses, nothing, no nothing, dear viewer, compares to the outrage of the right-wing YouTube manosphere.  For it is they, the true alpha males, cut from a different cloth, chiseled in his image, the Adonis master race of infallible titans, come to free the betas of their cuckold and live as the upright, walking alphas they were destined to cream.  And there's nothing more alpha than no BS and the quartering.  Why these two in particular?  Well, sure, there's Tim Pool and his weaponized string of outrage porn. ",
