Thank you very much.  That was Piers Morgan and Good Morning Britain talking about the Tess Holliday Cosmo UK cover, which is up for cover of the year.  Cover of the year because nothing is, you know, more healthy for our society than to put a morbidly obese person on the cover normalizing obesity.  Now, you can call her pretty.  You can say she's attractive to you.  You can say all those things.  But please do include that she is morbidly obese.  She is morbidly obese.  That is just a fact.  I mean, if you want to include all the other things, please do.  That's a matter of opinion.  But the fact is, she is morbidly obese.  She is going to shorten her lifespan being as big as she is.  It is fact.  It is just fact.  I believe that having her on the cover of a magazine like that is harmful to people.  I am in agreeance with Piers Morgan on that subject.  It is just harmful to me.  It truly is.  I believe it is harmful for our society in that when it used to be if somebody was obese, They were like, oh no, I need to do something about this because I am obese and I will short my life.  But now with the healthy at every size movement, which she is a part of, which she has been openly stating that you can't tell if a person is healthy by looking at them, which is false.  That is not factual.  That is not factual at all.  So she is a part of that movement.  She's a part of your beauty standards.  She's a part of this movement, that movement, the fat acceptance movement, the morbid obesity acceptance movement, whatever you want to call it.  She is one of the figureheads of it.  When people normalize morbid obesity, it causes them to not worry about it as much.  It causes them to not do something about it.  Therefore, it actually hurts people because once a person becomes morbidly obese, they think it's normal and they think it's okay and they don't take the steps they need to do something to lengthen their life, to actually make themselves healthy again.  It is a problem.  It is a societal problem.  It is systemic in our society.  We must do something about it.  And having this be cover of the year, It probably should be cover the year.  now I think about it.  It probably should be because it did spark conversation.  And I am very happy to be one of the people that is having this conversation often, to the chagrin of many of my followers that don't want me to talk about fat acceptance as much, but I don't see anything more important in our society.  With both people in Great Britain and America getting obese at unprecedented rates, making it normalized, making it seem like it's okay, making it seem like it is not actually unhealthy.  That is a problem to me.  Now, I was alerted to this video from Good Morning Britain from looking at Twitter.  Tess Holliday basically tagged Piers Morgan and said, hey, my cover's up for cover of the year.  He actually tweeted back saying, I have nothing against you, congratulations, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But I did see that a couple days later, after they discussed this, she tags him to get him to talk about it.  Then a couple days later, she kind of pulls victim, which she does all the time.  She pulls victim and be like, I heard I was talked about on Good Morning Britain.  Well, she said, why don't you fly me out there?  And Piers was like, okay, well, Piers and Good Morning Britain, I'd love to sit in on that.  You can Skype me in.  You can do whatever you want.  But I would love to do that.  She has me blocked.  I'm sure it's blocked on Twitter now, too.  But she has me blocked on most forms of social media.  I would love to sit in on that conversation because there is absolutely no way that this can be seen as healthy.  None.  But I did want to talk about the video, the Good Morning Britain video a little bit, just to see the conversation that is being had in a country whose national healthcare system is getting crushed by diabetes and obesity.  Crushed.  Britain's national healthcare system is just being destroyed.  by obesity. ",

I even did a video about that, that our entertainment should represent our reality.  We should see many, many, many more people that are overweight, obese, and even super obese on television, on our media.  We should see that all the time.  We should see it much more often because the majority of people in both Great Britain and in America are overweight.  A vast, vast, vast, vast number of people are obese, and there is even quite a large percentage of people that are super obese, meaning BMI's of 50 and above.  That should be shown.  That should be reflected in our entertainment.  It should be reflected in our media.  It absolutely should be.  Just as all the health issues that come along with it should be front and foremost also too.  All of the health issues that come along with being overweight, obese, morbidly obese should also be seen.  If you want representation, it should be a true representation.  of what you actually are.  it should not be this glamorized effect of.  you can be a cover model and everything is great and you can't tell if i'm healthy or not.  no it should be a true representation of what society actually is.

He just brought up when you go to a doctor, the doctor's going to tell this person to lose weight, tell Tess Holliday to lose weight.  And yes, I'm sure they are because being obese and being morbidly obese is very unhealthy for you.  However, I've seen so many, I've read so many articles on fat acceptance, how they talk about don't be fat shamed by your doctor.  You don't even need to be weighed by your doctor.  Very, very honestly, if you are morbidly obese, they have a harder time hearing your heartbeat with a stethoscope because there's so much tissue between the stethoscope and your heart.  It's just fact.  I mean, the problem is that you are morbidly obese.  You are carrying vastly too much weight for your frame But in many, many, many articles and almost every argument I've ever seen with you can't tell if I'm healthy or not by looking at me, they will even talk about don't listen to your medical professional.  That's the state we've gotten to.  And again, that is not actual reality.  So again, if we are going to celebrate this cover as cover of the year to the point where she wants to celebrate it and tag Piers Morgan and then claim victim because all of a sudden he talked about her, let's represent it really how it is, that she is unhealthy.

It is a person that identifies himself as an influencer saying this is okay, saying that this is glamorous, saying that this unhealthy body standard is okay.  That's exactly what it is.  And the doctor again kills it by saying it is teaching another generation of women that being morbidly obese is completely okay.  You can be pretty.  You can be nice.  You can be smart.  You can be intelligent.  You can be president.  You can be everything.  You can be anything you want at any size you want besides healthy.  You can be anything you want.  You can't be a professional athlete in some cases because you need to be healthy enough to be a professional athlete, but you can be any profession you want in today's world.  and be morbidly obese or super skinny.  You can be any profession you want, but you cannot be healthy.  That is just not true at every size.  There's no such thing as healthy every size.  And that is what this type of magazine cover propagates, that you can be healthy and happy at this size.  I deal with morbidly obese people on a daily basis because I coach people to healthy weights for morbid obesity.  That's what my wife and I do.  We coach people from morbid obesity to healthy weights as a living.  That is what we do.  We do this by not lying to them.  We do this by saying, you should not eat that because you are morbidly obese.  If you want to have children, you should lose weight.  If you want to have a healthy, long life, you need to lose weight.  That's why you shouldn't eat this.  That's why you shouldn't eat that.  That is what we do.  Telling people that it is okay to eat whatever you want and be whatever size you want and you're going to lead a happy, healthy life is lying to them.  It is a lie.  So, I would love to have a debate with Tess Holliday about healthy at every size.  I would love to sit down with anybody from the healthy at every size movement and have them tell me how it is okay to propagate an unhealthy standard, how the facts don't actually matter.  Because I found this whole scenario extremely interesting, how Tess Holliday kind of baited Piers Morgan into talking about it and then bitched that he talked about it.  I find that amazing.  But that I digress completely.  I find the whole conversation extremely necessary to be had.  Because in reality, there is no such thing as healthy every size.  And putting an obese model on the cover of a magazine, glamorizing it, is dangerous to our society.  And that's just my two cents of a matter.  My name is Alan Roberts.  Hit me up on Instagram at Everyday Fitness.  Hit me up on Twitter at Everyday Fit.  I'm also on Facebook at Everyday Fitness.  And my internet at EverydayFitness.net, where Tess Holliday has me blocked on most of those.  God damn. ",
