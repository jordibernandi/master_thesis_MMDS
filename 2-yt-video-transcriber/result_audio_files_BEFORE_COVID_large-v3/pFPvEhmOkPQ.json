And they make money that way, but women's professional soccer is a very low-profit enterprise right now.  And the women's soccer players are not paid substantially by their individual clubs.  They are paid by the U.S.  Soccer Federation.  So it's a different pay structure, again, because people watch men's soccer more than they watch women's soccer.  That's the only element of sexism in this whole thing, and it's not even sexist, that viewers, Americans, prefer watching the men play versus the women. ",

Well, have you ever went and paid to watch a women's soccer game versus far more Americans will go out and pay to watch a men's game?  So if you want women to get paid more to be soccer players, then go out and buy tickets.  Give them the backing that they need in order to do that. ",

            "text": "Right.  Be part of the supply and demand.  Because right now, I mean, everybody tunes in, by the way, and watches the World Cup every four years.  It is true.  I want to address this.  It is true that the ratings, the viewership for women's World Cup soccer games is similar to men's World Cup soccer games.  But that's not typical.  That's not how all the games are.  That only happens... During that short amount of time during the World Cup, if you look at the revenue generated in the other three years and 50 weeks, it's not the same whatsoever.  In fact, here are some of the numbers.  On Fox Sports, the women's soccer team, when they started airing the games, averaged approximately 63,000 viewers per game.  On ESPN, at the same time, the men's soccer team averaged about 240,000 viewers.  I mean, that's literal television advertising revenue right there.  that makes a huge difference as well.  And if you want to look at the revenue overall from World Cup games, the Washington Post actually reported this in 2015, that the women's soccer games earned only $17 million in revenue overall.  While in 2014, the men's final game brought in $529 million.  That's not a small difference.  That's a huge difference. ",

            "text": "Right.  And then if you dig deeper into this and look into the ways that men's and women's soccer contracts are drawn up and negotiated, women actually appear to have negotiated for different types of benefits versus men chose to get paid out in bonus structures, which led to a lot of the higher payouts for them.  And this really reflects the whole gender wage gap debate that we see and talk about all the time, where it's more of a gender choice gap.  Women are making different choices in the types of careers that they'll choose because they do value benefits such as maternity leave or more flexible hours.  And men might be more willing to take on extra hours.  So I think it's really unfortunate.  Although I support the women's soccer team in so many ways to see them out there claiming to be victims when that's really not the case. ",
