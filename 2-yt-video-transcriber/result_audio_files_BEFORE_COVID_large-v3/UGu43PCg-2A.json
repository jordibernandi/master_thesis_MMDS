            "text": "Cenk Uygur is an absolute wrecking ball.  Now, Cenk Uygur is a candidate for California's 25th District.  He's running against corporate Democrat Christy Smith, and I did a story about how Christy Smith was refusing to do a debate with Cenk Uygur, okay?  Now, they held a debate.  She wouldn't show up.  She's very scared.  And there were three other progressives here who I guess are like aligned with Cenk Uygur and their policies.  They showed up.  But Christy Smith didn't show up to the debate because she's super entitled, of course.  Now, I do want to give a thank you to Retro Proto because he actually posted the link to this debate.  Make sure to go to the subreddit and subscribe.  Reddit.com slash r slash progressive voice.  Make sure to go over there and subscribe.  Now, what I have done here is I chopped up a bunch of clips from the debate of Cenk Uygur himself speaking.  It's like four or five clips of him reaming and going after Christy Smith, calling out Christy Smith, exposing Christy Smith for being entitled for not showing up, for being anti-Medicare for all, for being a corporate sellout,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.  Okay, so go ahead and check this out.  We're going to come back and talk about it.  Christie's team has said a number of lies about tonight's debate.  All right, no problem.  Anytime, anywhere.  The Democratic Party, if they would knock her up, would say, she's disqualified.  So what kind of an insult.  and entitlement complex says, I don't have to speak for the voters?  That's ridiculous.  How am I going to ask the Democratic Party, are you kidding me?  Look at all these Democratic voters.  Look at all these Democratic voters.  And if the Democratic Party leadership says, we're not going to talk to any of you, and we don't give a damn what any of the voters think, we're going to make a decision in the back room, I'm not working with them, I'm fighting them, and I'm beating them.  The corrupt Democratic leadership says, oh, no, no, we've got to keep this seat blue.  Are you kidding me?  Of course we want to keep it blue.  Who wants to give it back to a monster like Steve Knight?  Nobody.  That bootlicker voted with Donald Trump in 99% of the time.  So, now, Kofi says, well, that's weird because her own seat, she says, I care so much about the committee.  She gave up her own seat.  And who did she endorse?  She endorsed Susan Christopher, who's a Republican, until a couple months ago.  Now wait a minute, I thought you wanted to keep things food.  Why are you doing this to Susan Christopher?  Do you know, she gave her $9,400.  She maxed out to a Republican in her home seat.  That's insane.  That's insane.  That's insane.  Yeah, so I'll look that up.  I don't know, but I will look it up.  So I love this talking point.  So I raised $800,000.  We've done PACs and corporations and lobbies.  It wouldn't be amazing at all.  It would be the easiest thing in the world.  Hey, PAC, what would you like me to do?  Corporation, what would you like me to do?  Lobbies, what would you like me to do?  Special interests, what would you like me to do?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  That's how all the other politicians raise money.  No, I got it from 30,000 donations.  So now they turn around and say, oh, no, no, those are just regular people.  Well, they're from all over the country.  Your followers are too strong.  Too strong.  Now, I mean, they say, oh, they're not from the district.  Hey, are Christy Smith corporate donors from the district?  No.  They are blogging from the district.  Oh, oh, oh, the district.  Oh, I'm going to represent you guys.  She's going to represent the donors.  That's right.  Okay, isn't that similar to the way Donald Trump is running?  So guys, here's the thing.  So they say, hey Jay, you're a bit of a celebrity, thank you.  How did I get that?  Was I dancing with the stars?  Was I an athlete?  Was I an athlete to you?  I got it by fighting for progressives!  You're too many progressives and too many Democrats that love you for fighting for them for 18 years.  Maybe you should have done that and you would have had just as many people backing you.  That is the only reason why I am known.  I'm known for being a progressive fighter that says, get the money out of politics.  They vote for their corruption, for their lobbyists, for their donors, and they have the audacity to turn around and assault progressives both in this district and all across the country.  Don't you dare let them do that.  We want them to win.  This is not between us, but between us and the person that didn't show up.  She's the distributor wing of the Democratic Party.  She's against Medicare for All.  And she finances her campaign through corporate contributions.  That is all the difference in the world.  Now, as to why me, as opposed to the other three folks here, number one, I have the resources to fight Steve Knight and anyone else in the race.  They're right.  As I said earlier, it's not fair.  We should have public financing.  Everyone should have the same financing.  And the kids keep getting less and less out of their losers to fight back, thanks to all those wonderful progressives across the country.  But that's not all.  I also started Wolfpack to get money out of politics.  We've been doing that for a long time.  And it's really great that you've just decided not to sweat it.  And I'm aiming it at you, because no matter why you take corporate PAC money, And I fight, and I fight for practical and pragmatic reasons.  You do it through public pressure.  We would have never gotten the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, if Martin Luther King had not.  I mean there is absolutely no way that you watch that video and those clips of Cenk Uygur not get riled up and get hyped up and see how he's just so passionate how he's.  you know this again this bulldozer.  he's a wrecking ball if you will and honestly if he is to get into the House of Representatives C-SPAN is going to be insane.  the House of Representatives is going to be pretty insane with him on.  you know the debate stage and what not.  it's going to be pretty insane but Christy Smith is so entitled that she didn't even show up to the debate.  Now, this is actually a parallel to the AOC race in which she had run against Joe Crowley, in which she emerged victorious.  Now, if you recall that race, Joe Crowley actually didn't show up to a debate against AOC because he thought he was going to win it easy.  He was an incumbent for a long time, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Similar to Christy Smith, except Christy Smith has been handpicked.  Christy Smith has been endorsed by Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, I believe Feinstein as well, and Pelosi.  So she is completely corporate backed.  She's backed by Katie Hill herself as well.  And so she's under this impression that basically she doesn't have to do anything for the voters and she's automatically going to get picked.  And this is another reason why Democrats don't seem to appeal to a lot of normal voters is because They have their own corporate elitism that they have in their own ranks, which is what we are trying to fight against.  That's what this uphill battle and overtaking the Democratic Party is.  There's just a story about how AOC is talking about how she's not paying DCCC dues because they're basically against people primarying corporate Democrats.  So if Cenk Uygur wins the race, it's going to be a huge change and an impact in Congress.  And him calling them out is insane.  Now what was interesting there was, if you recall the video that I did about his interview, a local interview on the, I think it's called like Talk of Santa Clarita, with a guy I believe by the name of Steven, who was the person he was talking to, he's actually a moderator here.  Now yeah, he, you know, equated him to Donald Trump, which seems to be a very common thing that the neoliberals like to do, they enjoy doing, it's hilarious.  But Cenk is talking about his, you know, deep history of being a progressive, his progressivism.  And, you know, how he's cultivated this big progressive audience, essentially.  And he has done a lot to garner this progressive audience.  And so he's really rubbing that in.  And again, he's definitely made the money in politics aspect the biggest thing about this race.  He always ties everything back to that corruption, that money in politics.  He also makes a point about how she had supported someone who's a Republican up until very recently.  So he's drawing some lines there, of course.  But he always brings everything back to corruption, which is a very popular thing.  Explaining to people how the other person is corrupt and you're not corrupt is huge because it means that, you know, you're going to represent the people, the other person is not, right?  Which makes it... It makes a world of difference.  It's really cool to see him doing this.  It's awesome to see him get this fired up.  I don't know how you could listen to that and not be riled up, excited, fired up to really go and fight for some change.  He's really going to be a wrecking ball in Congress.  And, you know, another thing worth mentioning about the sort of entitlement thing about Christy Smith is.  she sent out a tweet where she quoted herself.  It's weird.  It was a quote saying, like, a woman of substance doesn't need to bend the will, bend the knee to that of a man with neither or something like that.  And it's hilarious because she thinks that she's a woman of substance.  Here's the thing, right?  Christy Smith is a literal ghost.  Do any of you guys, have any of you guys ever heard Christy Smith speak?  I've been keeping a pretty close watch on this race, okay?  Pretty close.  Pretty much as close as anybody else has been, except for maybe local people on the ground, okay?  I've never heard Christy Smith speak.  I don't even know what her voice sounds like.  She's a total ghost.  And when have you heard her talk about policy positions?  All I've seen from her on her Twitter account is... Talking about raising funds and then smearing Cenk Uygur as not being a progressive because of his 2006 videos on TYT.  So it's hilarious to me.  So she's both a cabal of, she's a fake Democrat, she's a Republican.  She is... A sellout, okay?  She's, you know, bought out a corrupt politician.  She's super entitled because she's got the backing of the entire DLC, the Democratic Leadership Council, or, you know, the elite Democrats, whatever you want to call it, right?  Pelosi, Gavin Newsom, Kamala Harris.  Like, all these people are well-established, powerful California Democrats who are corrupt themselves and don't represent the people.  So, you know, there's that sense of entitlement and it just goes on and on.  and she's not someone who's about any substance.  So she's a coward for dodging a debate.  If you're going to represent, you know, a voter base, you better show up to a debate.  OK, otherwise you deserve to be shamed into oblivion for now.  How do you not show up to a debate?  Are you kidding me?  Do you know how embarrassing that is, dude?  Get your ish together, man.  What are you doing?  But this was very awesome to see.  I hope you guys did enjoy that.  And he really, really gave it to her. ",
