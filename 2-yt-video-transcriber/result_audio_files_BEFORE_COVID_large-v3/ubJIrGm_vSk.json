            "text": "Greetings, this is Indian in the Machine.  I'm very excited to share with you further proof that the Shroud of Turin is the supreme commander, Sananda Izu Emmanuel.  Now look at the Shroud of Turin image and look at the picture from 1963 of Sananda.  in which it is said that he appeared in tangible form in Chichen Itza, Mexico and allowed himself to be photographed.  Look at the S in the hair of the Shroud of Turin and the image of Sananda and you will see it's pretty much an exact match.  Now this for me is literally 110 proof that the shroud is sinanda and furthermore there are numerous implications of this including proof of the resurrection proof of immortality proof of an extraterrestrial who lived on earth at the time of Jesus and is immortal and is now in other dimensions and such.  God has given us a gift here for anyone who can not be so certain as I am.  Look at how the eyes line up, the lips line up, the hair lines up.  And in Phoenix Journal 2, they even hinted that the Shroud of Turin was legit.  So check it out.  Let the truth sink in, dear ones.  There are extraterrestrials, there is immortality, and there is a Supreme Commander, and he is here, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  This is awesome news.  Sananda, our brother, has returned.  This is the proof that many have been seeking.  There is no need to question any further on this matter.  Let your heart decide and make sure that it's open.  Thanks for tuning in. ",
