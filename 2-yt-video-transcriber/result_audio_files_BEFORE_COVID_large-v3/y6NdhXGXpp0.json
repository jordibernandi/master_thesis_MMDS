It's the fact that technology is pushing our economy to a point where more and more Americans are having a harder time finding paths forward.  Amazon's closing 30% of our malls and stores in the next four years.  And being a retail worker is still the most common job in this country.  The average retail worker is a 39-year-old woman making between $9 and $10 an hour.  We know she doesn't have much in the way of savings.  So as her stores close, the opportunities disappear.  We have to start focusing on solving those problems, and that's what makes America think harder.  It's the opposite of this call to yesteryear.  We need to start solving the problems of today. ",
