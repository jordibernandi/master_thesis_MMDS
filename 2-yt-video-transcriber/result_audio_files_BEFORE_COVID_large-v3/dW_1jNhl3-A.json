            "text": "Hi, my name is Aaron, and this is my show, Re-Education, and today I want to talk about why I absolutely hate liberals.  Now, when I'm talking about liberals, what I'm talking about is the political compass definition of a liberal who is a centrist.  Now, my problem isn't with centrists necessarily, I think that they have their purpose.  I think that they are a good base for both sides to be able to pull in different directions to make them come to a stronger conclusion, but I inherently think that centrism is a dangerous, comfortable position that people only fall into when they believe that the system has zero flaws.  And when you believe that the system has zero flaws, there is a good, very strong chance that you're being exploited and that you might be benefiting from that system.  These are problems.  Right?  That the majority of centrism has.  When you are talking about centrism, you are talking about a position of weakness.  You're coming from a position that has no teeth.  The only time... And I said this in a video the other day.  The only time that there is ever any social change is when the fringes make it happen.  Change only ever comes from the fringes.  It cannot come from the center.  The center is where people sit and be comfortable.  They don't do things.  They just allow things to happen to them.  Centrists are a necessary evil.  Like I said, they can be moved from one position to another.  And it is up to us, as those radicals, to be able to move them to a position of strength.  Centrism is not a position of strength.  Anarcho-communism is a position of strength.  When you have nothing but platitudes, when you have nothing but mealy mouth, nothing sentences that literally motivate absolutely no person on earth, you don't win.  You only win.  When you have strength, when you have things that people believe in, when you have ideas that people can get behind.  The other huge problem that I have with liberalism is that it's considered to be the left.  And anything beyond that point, that centrist point, is considered to be leftist.  extreme and radical.  And that is because the Overton window has been shifted so far to the right that centrism is looked at in the United States and in Canada as being the far left.  And I can assure you that centrism has absolutely zero to do with the far left.  When you consider centrism to be the far left, then that means that anything beyond that is taboo.  That means that anything beyond that point is something that you aren't allowed to talk about.  And this is why My channel exists.  My channel exists because I am on that fringe.  I am on that extreme side and I believe that people, for the majority, only ever get to hear a position from the strongest end of the conservative side.  They only get to hear The strongest of the fascists, the strongest of the racists, the strongest of the authoritarians, they don't get to hear the strength that comes from the left, that comes from anti-authoritarianism, that comes from libertarian socialism.  They don't get to hear the strength of those arguments because they're considered taboo.  If you've noticed throughout this video series, I've been confronted countless times with arguments that would normally be considered difficult for most people to answer.  If you have a capitalist system, most people can't answer a lot of the questions that I'm being proposed.  And yet, every time, the answers are there.  The answers are simple.  They're even obvious.  That's because this is the strongest position to hold.  I have had countless people now, countless fascists and racists, watch my videos and say, hmm, that's an interesting point.  I want to know more about this.  I want to know more about this position of strength that I've never heard of before.  This sounds like an interesting idea to me.  All I've ever heard of was hate, and I thought that there was no way for us to actually be peaceful, and yet here you are with arguments that allow us to have those things and to still be strong.  Well, that's because we're being forced to not listen to anything further than the center.  We're not allowed to listen to anything beyond the liberalism of Hillary Clinton.  I'm telling you right now, Hillary Clinton is not even centrist.  She's a right-winger.  Bernie Sanders is just barely left of center.  And he has a bunch of crazy radical ideas and solutions that a lot of people like.  Well, it turns out that the further that you go... Over to that side, over to the anti-authoritarian leftist side, the better your answers become.  Because you don't have all of this disgusting baggage of capitalism.  You don't have all of this disgusting baggage of authoritarianism.  You don't have all of this nonsense, this bullshit trying to... justify a system that is clearly broken in every single way and saying that, no, somehow things still work, things are still possible, you were still able to get through.  No, you're not.  You're being stifled at every single turn.  You're being told that your beliefs are wrong at every single turn.  And you're being stopped by the amount of money you make, by the amount of social capital you have, by all of these arbitrary barriers that capitalism inherently creates.  You are not allowed to hold opinions that can help others.  people.  You are only allowed to hold opinions that inevitably enforce the structure, that inevitably enforce centrism.  I don't hate liberals because I think they're bad people.  I hate liberals because I don't believe that they have the strength and conviction that is necessary to be able to make a real difference.  At least that's the way I look at it.  My name is Aaron.  This is my show, Re-Education.  Thanks for watching. ",
