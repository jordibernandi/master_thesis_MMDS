            "text": "Okay, this is going to be a brief update on Persia and what has happened recently.  And right now, as a matter of fact, I'm working on, it's going to probably take me two to three weeks to get this together, for our International Prophetic Summit, which is coming up in April, which is 12 messages with five speakers.  It's the biggest prophetic conference probably held anywhere in America.  and i'm going to delve into ezekiel 38 and 39. it's very complicated.  this will be about a 70 to 70 to 70 to 80 minute message because you have to do the word studies and that's what i'm doing right now.  i'm digging out for example where it says israel would become a great army.  the hebrew word there root word means to twist which doesn't make sense but then i'm doing some explanation on that.  But this is what I want to share with you about the significance of what you're seeing.  Ezekiel 38 and 39 mention a war called the War of Gog of Magog.  And this is a war that prophetic teachers had been anticipating for quite some time.  But there's never been a strong alignment to where we could say that this could happen.  This is probably the first time since I have been in ministry for 44 years that recent events are aligning for this to take place.  Now people who do not believe in prophecy or they don't study the Bible or read the Bible, they see what's happening and they become real stirred and they become very upset.  However, prophecy which has been recorded by the biblical prophets concerning the time of the end will come to pass sooner or later.  And Persia is mentioned as the nation that will lead this battle at the time of the end.  And of course there'll be two big locations of this battle.  Persia is the country of Iran.  Now I want to make two quick statements about the country of Iran.  You have to be careful watching the secular networks.  As you see people in Iran, you know, burning effigies of Trump.  They placed an $80 million bounty for someone to take out Trump.  That just happened two days ago.  They say death to America, death to Israel.  And these individuals who are the radical elements in that country are showing what they are.  And we've been told by sources, and I want to say this, this may not have made news publicly, We have been told by sources that the reason that this general was taken out was because the attack, the attacks that were being planned were not being planned overseas.  They were being planned here in the United States.  and because of the sleeper cells that are here, and by the way, these sleeper cells are not really sleepers.  I mean, our government has monitored and tracked people.  People don't even know they're being monitored and tracked, and they're watching them right now all over the United States, and so there'll be people that'll be arrested.  Some will be arrested secretly.  Some will be arrested without anybody knowing it.  that are planning things, but let me just say this, that The thing about the Iranian people, because we know a number of Iranian people, the Iranian people, 30% of them, I'm sorry, 80% of them are under 30 years of age.  And I can tell you for a fact of what you're not going to see on the news, is that the 80% of the youth who are in the country of Persia do not like and cannot stand the mullahs and the imams and all these different people that are the radical element.  There's about 20 to 25% that's actually the radical element in that country.  And they want them out.  And you see the news coming from there, you're getting the propaganda, the burning of the flags, death to America, we're gonna do this and this and this.  But I'm just gonna tell you something.  If you are in that line of thinking that you're going to attack or do things, you have a different president in there.  You don't have Obama in.  Obama was passive.  Obama got I know this from insiders.  When Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize at the beginning of his presidency, when he did nothing to get it, to gain it, they did that to restrain him from having any war.  so he would never have a war, he would never fight, he would never defend the United States.  because when you get that award of a Nobel Peace Prize and you make a speech, you get three, four times more money anywhere because of just that prize.  America has gone through this particular stage of where They're weary of war.  They're tired of Afghanistan and Iraq and all this, which is very understandable.  And America by and large is not a country that wants to go to war, but we will defend our country and our people abroad.  And so this is a different leader that we have.  He is not going to sit back and let these people get free money and and then apply it to terrorism.  In fact, an Iranian man told me that when Obama released all that money before he left as president that last day, and they shipped all that money in, that the Iranians, the Persian government, hired 7,000 secret police to come after Christians and come after believers and arrest people and follow people around.  That was a good deal, wasn't it?  How good a deal is that?  So my point is, you know, Things are going to be very, very strange, probably for the next three, four, five months.  But if we have to go into a worse scenario, trust me, this is not going to be a long, drawn-out Vietnam.  We hear all these people talk about stuff.  I mean, I don't even want to tell you.  I mean, it's on the news.  But I only wanna tell you some of the weapons that could be used.  that would end it in no time.  And I'm not talking nuclear here either.  But I'm saying that it's gonna be very interesting, but we're living in prophetic times.  So just remember, these are prophetic times.  And also, you should never have a fear of Israel defending itself because Israel has weapons nobody's ever seen, that they've never brought out of their arsenal.  Again, very quick strike, has nothing to do with nuclear.  And the Bible says that when this war takes place, that the nations that attack Israel, all but one-sixth of their armies are going to be decimated and wiped out.  So I wanted to give you just a little update.  I'm not going to go into detail.  I do not.  I wanted to say this to you.  I get a lot of people that comment, why don't you say more on Facebook and on the internet?  It's called, why is it a serpent and harmless as a dove?  Because there's things that need to be said in a setting of people who believe the way you do, who are hungry for the teaching, who understand it and can comprehend it versus just making updates and things go public.  We've had so much the trolls and the opposition, it's not worth it to me to just give people everything and anything.  You can come to our meetings and be a part and you can plan that.  Sometimes we'll have material that's available and it helps keep our ministry going.  And I could care less about critics.  Critics are a dime a dozen.  Opinions are like noses.  Everybody's got one.  So I do not waste my time answering skeptics and critics, I could really care less about what they think.  I really don't.  I'm 60 years of age now and I've been preaching 44 years and I don't care what they think.  I know what I believe.  I know what the Word says.  I know what the prophetic scriptures teach after over 170,000 hours of Bible study.  And so for the people who are hungry for the Word, desire the word and many of you that follow us I know are that way.  We want to from time to time share things with you.  So I want to give you a little bit of that and tell you that this is the first time in my lifetime that I can start seeing the very slow alignments take place.  Even today when the parliament in Iraq voted to remove all US troops out of Iraq which is really stupid.  and the reason they're doing that is because the southern part of Iraq is Shia Muslim and And Iran is Shia Muslim.  And then the Kurds in the northern part is Sunni Muslim.  And man, these two folks have been fighting each other all the way back to the death of Muhammad.  And so they're going to continue to fight each other.  So there's a little bit more to that, but we'll leave that alone and just tell you to pray.  Be sensitive to the Lord.  Keep your eyes open, your heart open for the things of God.  And you can always join us on our Tuesday night services at Omega Center International.  And we'd love to have you to come and join us.  And we appreciate this great city of Cleveland and our police force, our security forces here, our SWAT teams here.  We have a great force of men and women that we're very close to in our city here.  And we appreciate, I appreciate, if I can say this, the Bible Belt where people still believe in God and they still believe in the scripture and they still believe in family.  And I know a lot of you in the Midwest and West that we hear from are the same way.  So bless you.  Thank you for your time. ",
