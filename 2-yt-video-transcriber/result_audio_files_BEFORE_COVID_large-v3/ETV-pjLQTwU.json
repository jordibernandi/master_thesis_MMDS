Juicy Smollett.  He's doing our job.  I have a question about this.  People are making such a big deal about if you were to fake it and, like, the consequences that he should go through, but I know so many accounts of, like, white people in history that have faked, um... something that a black person has done to them, and it was never this, like, serious to people.  I just have a question as to why this is, like, such a big deal.  Well, we're pretty divided right now as a country politically.  We're very polarized.  And it seems like he did this fake hate crime in order to promote his own career and kind of become, like, the ultimate victim.  Like, he's a gay black man, and for those two reasons he was attacked, that was kind of the narrative he was pushing.  So I think he should be held accountable.  I agree that there are times in the past where maybe historically... Bad things have happened to people that didn't deserve it.  And I think this actually marginalizes those kind of stories.  And this actually kind of waters those down and makes them less in the spotlight and less, you know, important in a way.  I think this is actually really bad. ",
