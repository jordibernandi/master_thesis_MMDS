You might be wondering, why is that great news?  Well, the reason is because all of my old friends are here.  That's right, Dim Whitley, and Fuck Taylor, and Shit Johnson, and Ban, and Ron Fraudster, and whatever the name was of that agent that Jesse played.  They're all here, and I'm excited to hang out with them again.  Some of you might also be wondering, is this another figment of your imagination, Chris?  It seems like it must be.  Well, I would say to that, I doubt it.  Anyways, we've got a great program for you this week as the Fat Master calls Jamie.  Plus, we've got calls to Patrick Netherton and the Right Chicks.  First, though, J.J.  McCartney is wearing a shirt, and so we call him about that, but he also has IQ Al Rasooli and his helicopter microphone on, and we decide to call and confront him about the awful audio quality.
