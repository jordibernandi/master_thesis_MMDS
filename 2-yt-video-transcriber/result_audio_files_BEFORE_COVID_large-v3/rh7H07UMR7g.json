            "text": "Hey guys, so I really think that this is a story that needs to be getting more attention, a story that I broke yesterday that people really ought to focus on because it shows a lot about Ilhan Omar's character.  Yesterday, I released a story about how Ilhan Omar was caught on video endangering children and breaking several laws in Minnesota.  As you know, Ilhan Omar is the United States Congresswoman, and thus she's a lawmaker and has a duty to uphold the law.  And if you look at my article, I clearly show the evidence of how she was in the car filming herself while she was driving, okay?  And her six-year-old daughter was in the backseat of the car, not wearing a seatbelt, not in a booster seat.  That's a violation of Minnesota law.  That's actually two violations, a violation of the booster seat safety law and the seatbelt law.  And then her son was also seen in the video not wearing a seatbelt.  What kind of mother films herself while she's driving and then doesn't put a seatbelt on her children?  First of all, that's endangerment.  That's child endangerment.  And it just goes to show you what kind of degenerate people were electing to Congress.  When you have a Congresswoman who doesn't even want to uphold basic laws when you're just in a car transporting children, okay?  Along with being a Jew hater, Ilhan Omar can now add bad mother to her resume.  And this is something that really does need to go viral, okay?  Because I personally take offense to that.  I take offense to that.  I'm not a mother, but I take offense to that knowing that there are a lot of children who are dead.  There's a lot of children who will continue to die in the future because of, endangerment from other people, reckless drivers.  Every single day, thousands of people die from reckless drivers, people distracted by their cell phone.  And Ilhan Omar has the audacity to one, transport two children in a car, and then on top of that, with them not wearing a seatbelt, she's gonna film herself asking Beyonce to meet with her and her daughter.  I mean, talk about priorities, right?  She could crash and potentially kill somebody else, somebody else driving with their kids who actually are in seatbelts.  But Ilhan Omar is just so selfish and she's so concerned about identity politics that she literally wants to endanger children just to get a little message over to Beyonce on Instagram.  It's honestly disgraceful, you guys.  Absolutely disgraceful.  This woman is totally unfit to be serving in our Congress. ",
