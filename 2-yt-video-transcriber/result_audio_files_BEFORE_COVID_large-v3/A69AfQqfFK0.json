            "text": "So Tulsi Gabbard not only won the debate, but she exposed the fact that many Democrats, though they claim to be the party of peace, are actually neocon warmongers.  So first of all, let's talk about why I think Tulsi Gabbard won the debate.  It's pretty simple.  She ended up being the most Googled candidate.  during and after the debate, which is huge when you're a candidate that is seeking name recognition.  That is the entire point of being there on the debates.  You want people to say, who are you?  I need to find out more about you.  That's the whole point.  If you're a candidate that's coming in with less name recognition than somebody like Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who have a lot more name recognition in the stage.  So Really, I think that that means I mean, she wasn't the only winner.  There's several ways to win a debate, but that is certainly a massive, massive thing.  So that was huge for her.  And I'm sure she received a bump in the fundraising.  It'll be interesting to see how much each of the candidates did receive a bump in the fundraising during and after the debates.  That would be really the true indicator of who won the debates.  is based on that, how many individual contributions they received.  Because it's not just about getting your name out there, but it's also about getting people to want to spread your message more and to donate to that.  But the big thing that Tulsi did besides that was she exposed the Democratic warmongering message by calling out Tim Ryan.  So let's watch this exchange.  Jump off what he said. ",

They're signing up to serve and protect Americans, to serve and protect our country.  And yet they're just being marched around like a type of police force.  And, you know, that is what Tulsi is saying, is that that is unacceptable.  to say, well, we have to.  We have to be there.  That's why you're sacrificing your life.  We just have to be there.

The Taliban has never come after the United States.  They've never been our enemy.  They're definitely an oppressive place.  I don't think we should be there.  I don't think they should be there in Afghanistan.  But we and Saudi Arabia and a few other nations helped create the Taliban.  We were largely responsible for the Taliban's existence to begin with.  which if you've watched some of my other videos, I explain that in detail of exactly how that happened.  But this is what all of these neocon democratic warmongers say, is they say, I don't want this.  I'm for peace, but we have to.  He gassed children.  He's a brutal dictator.  He's a monster.  Look at the way he rules his people.  They say this about everybody.  And they've continued to say this and they've continued to march us into these wars.  And it's not the truth.

            "text": "Yes.  Absolutely.  It is Saudi Arabia.  Why are we still using this excuse?  I mean, the Taliban, look, sure, after 9-11, they were maybe harboring bin Laden.  But al-Qaeda has been paid for and funded by Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia has harbored and cultivated more terrorists than the Taliban.  Why aren't we going after Saudi Arabia?  Why is it just the Taliban in Afghanistan?  Why not Saudi Arabia?  Well, because that's not really why we're going into these wars.  That's the problem.  That is the fundamental problem.  So still using something that happened years and years and years ago as the premise to why we're still in Afghanistan.  Nearly 20 years.  It's going to be 20 years soon that we're in Afghanistan.  And Tulsi's absolutely right.  We haven't eradicated the Taliban.  They were there before 9-11.  They're going to be there after 9-11.  That's just the reality of Afghanistan now.  And the only thing that we can do is withdraw our troops and make a deal with the Taliban.  Then Tim Ryan goes on to say, well, that's what Trump is saying.  That's what Trump is saying.  And so he automatically wants to be anti anything Trump says, even when it's to the benefit of our nation.  That is a warmonger.  that it doesn't matter if it's the correct response, if it's the right answer.  If Trump wants to do it, it's a bad idea.  I mean, it is just\u2014this is why we're never safe, because when the Republican Party is in power\u2014 now, when the Republicans say, let's go to war, let's go to war, The Democrats say, oh, my gosh, no, no, no.  But unfortunately, at that point, the Republicans are in power.  And so we're going to war.  But then what happens is when the Democrats get into power, they say, well, the Republicans didn't want to do this.  And so we have to because they didn't have the guts.  They weren't doing the right thing.  And so now we have to do what they were against.  So if the Republicans are ever against war, then the Democrats say, no, we need to be for war.  So.  At all times, one party is for war.  Either the Republicans are for war and the Democrats pretend like they're not, and it's just for pretend, or because they know we can be against war.  when the Republicans are for war because we're still going to end up in war, so it's okay.  Same thing.  When the Republicans are against it, Democrats all of a sudden are saying, wow, well, we must because look what he's done.  This brutal dictator, look at all of this.  And so we must go to war.  We must do something.  We're Americans.  We're humanitarians.  We must.  So we're always in perpetual war because of this.  We never get out of this.  So after this exchange of Tulsi going\u2014exposing Tim Ryan\u2014and, you know, he's not the only one.  This is a\u2014he's just spewing the same lines that they all spew.  He's just a little sample of what they're all thinking and how they're\u2014what they're all saying.  But after all of this, Tim Ryan goes on to say this about Tulsi after the debate.  So he was pretty mad about this exchange because he got called out.  I mean, he said the Taliban flew the planes into the building.  That wasn't true at all.  So he says, quote, I personally don't need to be lectured by somebody who's dining with a dictator who gassed kids.  I know what I'm talking about.  I'm right.  And we can't let these areas be wide open.  Really, Tim?  Really?  So you're going to say this.  You're going to smear a soldier who has served in combat and you think you're right.  You think you're the right one.  Okay, yeah.  And along those lines, bringing up Assad, trying to smear her over that.  Tulsi has always maintained that Assad is not our enemy.  She won't call him our enemy.  I don't know if she says directly he's not our enemy, but he's not our enemy.  And she won't ever say he is.  She won't ever say that he is an adversary of the United States because he isn't.  He's not trying to go after us.  He's not saying, oh, I'm coming after Americans.  I'm going after the troops.  I'm going to harm them.  I'm pointing nukes at you.  That is not anything that.  Assad has ever been saying about Americans.  So this other question that she was asked before this exchange is really relevant to that.  She was asked about what would be her red line.  And this is an important question because for so many Democrats and Republicans, it seems like anything is just going to march us into war.  You look at us wrong and we're going, you don't even have to look at us wrong.  We're just going to go to war with you if we want something from you.  So this is what she says is her red line.  This is when she would go to war. ",

            "text": "Yeah, absolutely.  That is the right answer.  The red line needs to be when we are provoked.  We need to be a sleeping giant.  We need to be docile.  We need to be on our own over here, just minding our own business.  And unless someone provokes us, like what happened during Pearl Harbor for World War II, that is when we march ourselves into war.  Now, with World War II, maybe we could have gone in a little bit earlier to help our allies.  I mean, we were being begged by England to save them because they were about to be taken over.  But, you know, it took a long time to get us into World War II.  It was a hard sell to the American people.  It wasn't a look.  You know, we were watching our allies being taken over by Germany.  We were seeing all of this happen.  And yet we still were saying, no, we're not we're not getting involved.  We're not getting involved because we don't want to be that country.  It took a lot to march us into World War Two.  It took an attack on our troops in order for us to say, OK, we're in now because we can't avoid this.  They're attacking us.  That has to be the red line when it comes to war.  That has to be it.  It can't be this.  Well, now, you know, we're no longer the sleeping giant, the sleeping beast.  I mean, we are on everybody's doorstep.  We've got military bases around the world set up on everybody's doorstep.  We are threatening them.  We're right there, right at their borders.  We're being very threatening.  We are not being a sleeping giant.  So after all of this.  There were a lot of, you know, several Democrats and liberal outfits honed in on the fact that there were many prominent conservatives and right-wing outlets that were singing Tulsi praises.  And of course, a lot of those liberal and democratic outlets, they don't like that.  The minute a conservative says something good about Tulsi or somebody else, they say, oh, my gosh, well, you must be one of them, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Here's an example from BuzzFeed.  So they wrote this article saying just here's some clips from it.  Among some conservative pundits, there was one clear winner of Wednesday night's Democratic primary debate.  Representative Tulsi Gabbard, the long shot anti-war Hawaii member of Congress, more than any other Democratic candidate, Gabbard has developed a favorable presence in the right wing media.  She's made appearances from time to time on Fox News shows like Tucker Carlson Tonight, and her unorthodox candidacy has attracted praise from those farther to the right as well.  On Wednesday night, Matt Drudge, the reclusive Drudge Report impresario, tweeted that Gabbard had won his site's online debate poll.  So I saw this and then I went to Twitter and people were like, oh, you know, she wins the Drudge poll.  Then that shows you what kind of person she is.  That's how this is.  And, you know, it goes on like Breitbart.  They... Breitbart News devoted a lot of its debate coverage to Gabbard, writing several articles about her.  Breitbart writer Joel Pollack livestreamed his exchange with Gabbard in the spin room after the debate, the only candidate who got that treatment.  So they're pointing out all of these right wingers.  They even go on to say Mike Cernovich, the new right social media personality, tweeted Wednesday night about the increase in Google searches for Gabbard, writing Tulsi Gabbard was breakthrough star of the night.  Then they talk later on about Ann Coulter, who tweeted, go Tulsi, after Gabbard tussled with Ryan over Afghanistan on stage during the debate, said she watched the debate with a liberal and a moderate on Wednesday, and all three preferred Gabbard over the rest of the field.  It's really outstanding that Tulsi is the only Democrat running frontally and unambiguously as anti-war, Coulter wrote in an email, calling the Democrats as relentless a war party as the Republicans at their worst, only more feckless.  So people have honed in on this and they say, well, a Breitbart likes her and Ann Coulter and look at the company that she's keeping with these people who like her.  And listen up, guys.  How are you thinking this election is going to be won?  You think it's just going to be with hardcore Democrats and that's the only way?  No, you have to win over independents and you also have to win over some right wingers who maybe voted for Trump, who are looking for another candidate.  You need a candidate who is willing to reach across and talk to these Americans.  This is not a Democrat Republican issue.  These are Americans and Americans are going to be casting their votes when it comes to this election.  It's not just, oh, our team, your team.  Don't cross over here.  Don't cross over there.  That is how you lose.  And if you're one of those people, which I see many of these people, some of them are even my friends who are sitting there saying, oh, you know, we don't want any candidate who cozies up to these right wing conservatives, to any of these outlets.  Look, you are going to cause the loss of this election to Donald Trump.  It will be you, not somebody like Tulsi Gabbard.  It will be you.  You will be the person.  Tulsi Gabbard has the best shot at beating Donald Trump because of exactly what BuzzFeed wrote about.  Because not only do progressives love her, Democrats will vote blue no matter who, and independents and some conservatives even like her.  That is a clear winner.  That is a clear winner.  So she just has to get the nomination.  If she can get the nomination, she absolutely would beat Donald Trump.  I have no doubt about that.  She is the best possible candidate to defeat him.  I just don't know how many people are going to wake up and realize that and, and go for it, you know?  So, um, But I loved that she called out these, the neocon Democrat warmongers who are no different than the Republicans.  They just say, no, no, I want peace.  I want peace.  But, but that's what they all say.  So, all right.  I do want to show you this.  Look at what I'm wearing.  I'm wearing this.  Super Progressives shirt.  I am not affiliated with this company.  I am just really flattered that I was included in the picture here.  Let me see if I can show you.  I am right, where am I?  I'm right here.  You can see my superhero, Kim the Samurai.  It says Kim on the boot.  You've got Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard.  You've got Jimmy Dore, Kyle Kalinske, Nico House, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  You've got Marianne Williamson here.  Cenk Unger, you've got Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ilhan Omar on this.  And they notified me and told me that I was included in this bunch and I was just so flattered.  So I had to order myself a bunch of shirts and I even got myself a mug of me.  I know it's kind of... But it's cute, you know?  This is so cool.  So you could get this for any of your favorite progressives.  I'm going to get a Tulsi one.  And you could get, you know, you can get a Bernie one.  You can get Marianne or whoever you want in individual.  Or you can get the group.  They've got stickers, mugs, shirts.  Again, I don't make a single dime off of this company or anything like that.  I'm not affiliated at all.  I just think it's so cute.  So the link, I'm going to put that down below.  Thank you guys for watching.  And until next time. ",
