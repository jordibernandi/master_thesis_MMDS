            "text": "Welcome to another episode of No Dick with Chloe.  She leaves her dirty underwear on the floor?  No dick.  She has to read the instructions for spaghetti?  No dick.  If you give her morning head and she never gives it back?  No dick.  If she expects you to drive her friends around?  No dick.  If she uses Victoria's Secret spray to cover up the fact she has bacterial vaginosis?  No dick.  If she expects you to pay to have someone else's hair sewn into her hair?  No dick.  She doesn't brush her teeth, no dick.  If she talks to you like this, but baby, why?  No dick.  If the drain gets clogged up with her hair and she expects you to clean it up, no dick.  If her nails are long enough to shank somebody, no dick.  But most importantly, if she does not make you feel valued and respected every day, no dick.  Thank you.  Back by popular demand, red flags from women, part two.  Self-entitlement.  It is a huge red flag when a woman believes that she deserves preferential treatment just because of how she looks.  The type of woman that believes that she deserves five-star treatment wherever she goes and will even go so far as calling people out and being rude if she doesn't get it.  The type of woman who treats people that she believes is below them completely disrespectful.  The type of woman that acts like she's above everyone else for no reason.  Hot girls who don't act like hot girls are the hottest girls.  Women who don't glide along on their appearance, but they still treat people with humility and respect, even if they are genetically blessed.  Humble, hardworking, down to earth, and genuinity is what you should be looking for.  No matter how good you look, guys will not put up with you if you're a biznatch.  Thank you.  Welcome to No Dick, part two.  If she expects you to give her head but won't give it, No dick.  If it's month two that you guys have been seeing each other and she still hasn't taken you out on a date, no dick.  She's got a nasty ass attitude that always makes you want to pull your hair out, no dick.  She never offers to pay for anything, no dick.  She leaves her makeup and hair stuff all over your bathroom, no dick.  She doesn't know how to do her taxes, no dick.  Doesn't ever compliment you first, No dick.  If she's got the audacity to try to go through your phone, no dick.  As long as you're not being a cheatin' little hoe.  She's always posting passive-aggressive or depressing memes on Facebook?  No dick.  But most important of all, if it smells like trout, stay the fuck out.  Thank you.  Are you guys ready for no dick part three?  Because I am.  Let's go.  She doesn't know how to cook anything other than Kraft dinner?  No dick.  Treats her parents like shit?  No dick.  She doesn't offer you back massages?  No dick.  If her bathroom looks like it hasn't been cleaned or organized in a year?  No dick.  Sleeps with a pile of trash beside her bed?  No dick.  Has a fruit fly infestation in her kitchen?  No dick.  Always having to pay you back for things?  No dick.  She doesn't make her bed in the morning?  No dick.  If she tells you that your dreams are stupid?  No dick.
