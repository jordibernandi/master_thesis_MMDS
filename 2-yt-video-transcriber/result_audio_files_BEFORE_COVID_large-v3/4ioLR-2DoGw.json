            "text": "What's up everybody?  It's your girl.  back for another video.  So since my last update, we have found out we are expecting a baby girl in less than three months.  It has been absolute chaos at my house.  The kids have gone back to school and it's just been absolutely crazy and I cannot film at home because the minute I walk in the door.  I have to cook, do laundry, you know, do my daughter's hair, baths, dinner, iron hubby's clothes.  It just goes on and on.  And I'm literally running around like a chicken with my head cut off.  So I figure I need to go back to filming in my car.  like I'm doing now, just left a baby doctor appointment to check on baby girl, and I figured I'd film real quick before I go home in the madness.  I mean, it sounds like the Ottoman Zoo when I walk in the house.  So that's why I have to film in my car so much.  It is what it is.  But this video has been... You know, a long time request.  Should women know?  Should men be able to hit women?  Is that acceptable?  You know, should that be allowed?  You know, what do I think about that?  This is the thing.  When I was growing up, I was taught that, you know, men do not put their hands on women.  And boys do not hit girls.  And I believe that at the time because, you know, women are naturally emotional, sensitive.  You know, women are not naturally out there being bullies, being aggressive, being loud, dominant, masculine, you know, women.  But nowadays that has changed.  Liberalism and feminism has changed.  They've created, you know, women that are.  they want to be men.  It's like this new progressive regime.  They want women to be men and men to be women.  And in my opinion, it's all a plan to destroy the family unit, you know, to control people and.  know to conquer us.  and and how else do you do that?  what better way to do that than to first destroy the family unit?  make men think they're women and women think they're men.  you know turn the two genders against each other.  turn the races against each other even though we're all americans turn them all against each other make them all think they're different and make some think they're victims.  it's just that.  that's how they do it.  so this is the thing When women were nurturing and emotional and actually acted like women, no, I don't think men should have been out there putting their hands on women.  But nowadays, when you have these loud, aggressive, dominant women that act like men and are out fighting like men and trying to be men.  well that changes.  if they go out and put their hands on a man then they deserve to get their ass knocked out like a man.  you know you want to.  you want to go out in the street and curse and and and get all in a man's face and threaten to uh beat his ass and start hitting them.  you want to do that and act like you know some loud aggressive man then like i said you deserve to get your ass knocked out like a man.  You know, people deserve to be able to defend themselves against other people.  Doesn't matter what gender you are.  There's only two, by the way.  If you're a man, you have you should have the right to defend yourself against men and women.  If you got some loud, aggressive woman in your face, your girlfriend or your wife or just some random chick all up in your face and she starts throwing punches, you should be able to punch her ass back.  You know what?  I think you should punch her first.  No, but if she puts her hands on you, you deserve to be able to defend yourself.  It really ticks me off.  I've seen countless videos where men will be minding their own business and their girlfriend or just some random chick.  You know, for instance, I saw one where a man was working at a gym and his ex-girlfriend walked in and started beating his ass, punching him, kicking him, throwing stuff at him.  And he kept running away from her and ducking.  and when he finally couldn't run anymore he was in a corner.  she's punching him in his face.  he pushed her ass down and these two guys come out of nowhere and start hemming them up against the wall like he did something wrong.  that's completely up.  he did nothing wrong.  he was defending himself.  she should have went to jail for what she did.  he did nothing wrong You know, then I saw another video where they had a guy waiting in a line at a club.  And him and this girl started arguing.  She started it.  And she got all up in his face and then started punching him.  He punched her ass back and knocked her clean out.  And I was like, yes, that's what I like to see.  You want to go out there and act like a man, ladies?  You want to go act like a big, aggressive, dominant woman?  freaking bull dagger.  you deserve to get your ass knocked out.  if you put your hands on somebody i don't care if it's a man or a woman.  you put your hands on a man.  he deserves the right to be able to you know defend himself.  and if that means knocking your ass clean out so be it.  i don't care.  you should have thought about that.  you lost all your rights when you put your hands on him you know.  so that's how i feel about it.  comment below.  you know what do you think about that?  there's some people that have told me no matter what a man should never put his hands on a woman.  that is horse.  okay horse.  if a woman is out there fighting you and beating your ass and punching y'all in your face you deserve to be able to beat her ass.  okay never in my life at my age have I ever put my hands on a man.  never.  the only way I ever would is if somebody was attacking me.  then yes I will fight back any way I can and what I can't do with my hands I will do with a firearm.  so but I've never had to do that.  I've never put my hands on my husband.  You know, if we've ever argued, I would never put my hands on him.  I have no right to do that.  So comment below, like the video if you did, and I will see y'all back on my next one.  Bye. ",
