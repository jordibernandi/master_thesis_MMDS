            "text": "You're such an asshole.  All right, take two.  I'm going to hurt Mike.  The client sent me this request, and I had seen this video before, and I pulled it up.  I was like, oh, this one.  And it was painful.  Captain, in the spirit of Valentine's Day, I'm wondering if you'd break down this video and remind us all why being single these days isn't all that bad.  This video is from NBC News and these women have seemed to become a parody of themselves.  Yeah, it's mainstream media.  It's news in some... director or editor or whatever the title is decided to expend resources on putting this video together and and wasting editors time and video editors and These people who made fools of themselves the the women that are in this video.  I'm sure you'll really get a chuckle out of Lana.  She's real peach.  Yeah, she's like I'm gonna teach her and she talked like that.  I'm like you.  you can't be serious you can't?  You know, it's one thing if you see it on TV or, you know, like, ah, it's a stereotype.  And then you realize, no, that person actually exists in the real world.  The stereotypes are becoming standard.  They're not parodies.  That's what's sad about this video.  This is not a parody.  This is real world.  Half the time, can you tell if The Onion is a legitimate story?  The Onion is a spoof news site.  But man, nowadays, sometimes their articles, the titles are like, yeah, that may be a true story.  You know, it just might.  And if it weren't for being on The Onion, there was a good chance it would have been true.  He provides the link.  I'll provide the link below, but I'm not going to stream it here.  I wanted to kind of do the live takedown, but I don't want to get copyright infringement.  Happy to make a donation.  I'm sure you'll enjoy.  We'll all enjoy your take, Mike.  And so... I'll pull it up here even though I can't play it.  Um, it is, you gotta watch it because the number one concern again that I have giving younger men advice about dating that I haven't done in a long time, uh, And is it really that bad?  Is it really that bad?  I got to rely on other people like our good buddy Chad Elkins, some younger people, some of you young gentlemen out there.  Like, yeah, it's horrible.  It's horrible.  It's horrible.  Roosh talking about the arms race with smartphones.  But then, you know, is it?  I haven't been.  And then I see this.  It's like, wow.  So the video is just a bunch of precious millennial girls.  And they do the line to being fabulous.  And all the titles, the title is millennial women reveal all in quest for passion, love, and money.  And the... it wouldn't be so sad if they were actually hubristic and arrogant to have these delusional, what they're talking about, No anchoring to the real world.  None.  Completely scripted.  Completely spoon-fed in the nursing home for millennials called K-12 education.  And you could tell they have drank the Kool-Aid.  There is no altruism or selflessness.  There's no, well, I just want my husband in.  It's all about, I've got to balance my feminism.  And, you know, I don't want to make more.  I would like to make more money, but not too much more money in all these things.  childish, very childish.  If they think this is what life is about, they are guaranteed to have miserable lives because there's nothing like, I want a man to rock my world in bed.  I want to be a strong and I like being female.  None of that.  It is your career, your education, and money.  That's all it is.  And that's fine.  I'm not saying you shouldn't care about those things.  I'm not saying women should go out and be accountants or engineers.  but how it's prioritized.  And then also how they're, like I said, it'd be sad, but they're not arrogant or cocky or trying to do this Google thing.  It's, that's, that's what they want.  They, they are, there's no agenda.  This is what they really want.  So they're completely clueless as to what they're going to get in the real world and what they're expecting to get in the real world.  It's stereotypical.  The Lana gal, of course, is a teacher.  I think she is the most laughable of the bunch.  Yeah, the like to dislike ratio is huge.  I thought it was 33,000 likes.  It's 37 likes and then 1,400 dislikes.  The comments... Marriage is dead and these entitled basic females killed it.  Who in their right mind would marry any of them?  The like to dislike ratio is classic.  Time to invest in cat food.  None of them are babes.  Some of them are good looking.  I won't deny that.  Women don't love men.  They love what men can provide them.  Me, money, me, me, money.  Buy me this money and I'm a princess.  Vampires sitting around a table discussing the blood type of their future victims. ",
