The little girl is calling him daddy.  That's some sick-ish, too, that I want to talk about.  that came from the Surviving R. Kelly docuseries.  This man got to where he got these children not even able to call and contact their parents.  And it's a catch that's still taking up for this man.  Michael Avenatti, this guy, he actually represented Stormy Daniels against the most powerful man on the planet, and that is Donald Trump.  He represented Stormy Daniels when she was trying to go after Donald Trump.  However, so he's a heavy hitter.  He's a heavy hitter, man, and this is a heavy charge.  If convicted, if convicted, man, he's facing jail time.  More importantly... iTunes.  everybody can't take him off the list because he has not get been convicted yet, but I'm gonna get to that.  This is my life in the shot.  So now let me bring you, this is one of the, this is the tweets.  This is a statement.  He's a statement of Michael Aviani, Aviani, uh, regarding our Kelly investigation.  He says he was retained last year in April and that several people are, you know, with allegations of sexual assault to minors and he obtained and recovered a VHS videotape of Mr.  Kelly engaging in multiple sex acts with girls under age.  This tape is clear.  and is approximately 45 minutes in length and has never been previously disclosed or until recently.  He's reported over to the law enforcement.  Importantly, this conclusive video evidence is not the same evidence as previous, so they have a new tape, new girl.  All right, now, as a part of our effort to ensure that Mr.  Kelly is finally held accountable for his repeated sexual assaults of minors spanning over two decades, We will provide extensive information, including the videotape described above, and witnesses to Cook County State's attorney, Kim Fox, in Chicago.  Ms.  Fox is an exceptionally dedicated prosecutor, and she is personally committed to investigating this matter further.  We're going to see a lot of this.  This is some serious charges.  Okay, so now, our work has been painstaking, detailed, explicit, and time-consuming.  Mr.  Kelly is a predator and a criminal.  Who has preyed on young vulnerable girls for far too long.  The time has come for him to finally be held accountable for his actions.  I'm going to also bring you guys.  This is his Twitter page.  This is his Twitter page.  He just released this new tweet.  Actually five hours ago as you guys can see.  Let me get this picture out the way.  No not this one.  This one.  Alright.  This one.  Okay, so now this tweet is new.  Below, please find the second statement related to our investigation on R. Kelly.  As a father of two teenage girls myself, I have the utmost faith and confidence in Ms.  Fox and her staff to ensure justice is done.  They want this man and they want this man bad.  Alright, so now, here's the statement.  Second statement.  This is the second statement from Michael Aviani.  Remind you, his statement just came out.  This statement was just made public today.  February 14th.  In response to the press inquiries, we can confirm the following regarding the VHS tape we have uncovered and provided to law enforcement.  The VHS tape depicts Mr.  Kelly engaging in multiple sex assaults of a girl 14 years of age.  On this tape, Mr.  Kelly engages in oral, anal, and vaginal sex with the young girl in two separate rooms.  They are clearly visible throughout the tape and have been identified in a mold that they have been found on the bottom of his back, blah, blah, blah.  You can see him repeatedly directing the young girl to perform various acts.  In addition, Mr.  Kelly takes great pains to adjust the camera on many occasions in order to ensure What a sick individual.  Now, even under all this investigation, you think this man will burn these tapes, get rid of them?  He probably has, because from what everybody was saying from Surviving R. Kelly, that he was taping a lot of that stuff, if not most of that stuff.  And the sickest this individual got them calling him Daddy.  I don't understand.  Even a lot of other people talk about, oh, I call him Daddy.  It was a female dresser.  He called me Daddy.  Oh, no, hell no.  I'm not your father.  What type of sickish is this?  No, do not call me daddy.  Under no circumstances, that is the sickest issue I've ever heard.  A lot of these parents, man, especially the ones who are surviving R. Kelly, for those of you not seeing it, make sure you go out and see surviving R. Kelly.  You will have a total and utter new respect.  But a lot of cats are just trying to have this defense.  Oh, y'all already knew, so why y'all mad now?  It's one thing of knowing and seeing it, man.  This man got away with it.  A lot of people just kind of, the investigation was found not guilty.  A lot of people just let it go.  And because of he's famous and his music, a lot of people kind of turned a blind eye, which we should not have.  We should have dismissed him back then because he's clearly on evidence.  Tape.  Having sex with a 14-year-old girl.  I see young girls now that's 19 and 20 and they are babies.  19 and 20 are babies.  To me.  That is babies.  14 what in the world.  That is sick.  That is sick.  This man deserves the death penalty.  Forget jail time.  But so with the conviction.  He would be.  iTunes could take him off.  Spotify, all those accounts, all those platforms can completely drop him.  Record label, I think he's already been dropped.  Tours can be dropped.  This man is already facing a financial crisis, and that'll destroy him.  That'll destroy him.  But this man, I think sexual predators deserve the death penalty.  I don't think they deserve nothing more, none less.  Um, there was a sexual predator that said, you know, if he was let out, he'd be offended again.  He's just, it's something, a chemical imbalance.  Um, several R. Kelly's family, um, especially his brother Killer Kills, um, had that video out.  And then even did that interview, said, talked about the sister, um, was possibly molesting R. Kelly.  The brother Killer Kills said the sister was molesting him.  And he definitely thinks she was also touching, um, Robert R. Kelly or whatever the hell you want to call this cat.  Man, it ain't no good in it, man.  I got a partner that's cousins with R. Kelly, man.  And I've been to several sports bars in certain places, man, where I've seen where they recruited girls.  But it was in bars at least.  They were 21 and taking girls to R. Kelly crib, man.  You know, that's different, but... These little girls.  Now, this is one of my homeboys, Reese, man.  I got respect for him, man.  He do promotions.  He doesn't have anything to do with this.  But, you know, I'm friends with him, was friends with him on Facebook.  And he, you know, when all this was going down last month, he put this up on Facebook.  He's saying family support.  Whoever don't like it, hit that unfollow button.  Well, unfortunately, I didn't like it.  I don't follow them and I don't like it because I have a daughter.  And if this man touched my little daughter, R. Kelly, I'm talking about, I'm shocked.  None of the parents, he lucky to be alive.  honestly somebody said unfollowed.  he said done unfollowed.  somebody said yep cousin me too done and for real you know that's everybody's personal choice.  you know man Reese ain't got nothing to do with it but if I was him I would have stayed out of it.  like yo I'm gonna but you know he chose to stand up for his cousin and that's cool.  you know that's his personal preference.  however me Child molesters deserve, I don't care, family, no family, I don't care who you are, you deserve the death penalty.  But, you know, you see he got 160 comments, 38 shares.  And most of those comments, those 160 comments were in defense of R. Kelly.  I can't defend that, man.  Don't give me, Ro, much respect for Reese.  He's, uh... promoter in chicago does a good job.  like i said he is a personal friend too.  but you know i can't give with um the the allegations and not only allegations man so many of what we even seeing on tape 14 years old.  that's a whole nother ball game at that age man.  so you know um I don't know what to say about that.  I am done with Kelly, his music, and everything about that man.  It's sickening to me.  How can anybody still defend that?  Especially with children.  How can you defend that?  I don't know what to say.  Anyway, I want you guys to like, comment, let me know what you think about this video.  Peace, peace.  Okay. ",
