            "text": "Happy Sunday, family.  It is your girl T, aka the nappy-headed jojoba, here to talk about 10 or so times that our YouTube faves, our fave booty gurus, had us hoodwinked, bamboozled, and run amok.  I've been thinking about all the times over the years that all of a sudden it seemed that all of our faves were talking about one particular product or a couple particular products, talking about how it was completely changing the game, and then those products were never seen again.  Now, I know it's fair enough that we have favorites and sometimes we just move on to other things that we discover later on and like even better.  I know how it is being in the sunken place, as makeup struggles used to say, where you're just such a makeup enthusiast that you're constantly trying new things and sometimes you just straight up forget about things that you actually sincerely loved.  However, there are also those products where, in retrospect, or even sometimes while the YouTube love is happening, it is abundantly clear that all of this YouTube love has a lot to do with dollar signs.  What I'm saying is these gurus lie to us.  Not all, but many of these gurus are often in their bags and selling us things so that they can get a check or maintain a good relationship with a brand rather than being honest and sincere about products that they're actually enjoying and loving and plan to continue using after the check clears.  So that is what we are going to be talking about today.  This is just a lighthearted, fun video just kind of roasting ourselves for the times that we've been duped by our faves.  After all, I know I can't be the only one who, in the past, before I knew better, completely played myself, took these gurus at their word, and actually believed them whenever they said that they actually liked the product.  You know the old saying, fool me five or six or seven times, shame on you.  Two bits of housekeeping before I begin this drag.  First of all, can we talk about this lip?  The nude I am wearing right now has me very excited because it is from the collection by one of my YouTube faves and friends in my head, Mel Thompson.  She recently launched a collection with Christian Odette, and the sun is coming out from behind a cloud, but let's press on.  The collection features two lip liners and two lipsticks.  I am actually wearing both liners, Smooches and Kitten, as well as the Nude Lippy.  Smooches is a mid-tone brown liner, which I use to almost completely fill in my lips.  Then I went in the center of my lips with Kitten, which is a nude pink liner.  Then I went over the top in the center with Beauty, which is a nude pink lipstick.  and just kind of dabbed and patted, and that is how I have the nude that is on my mouth right now.  Puffin is a bright, bold orange, which I was tempted to wear, but I kind of have a lot going on with my eyes today, as well as my purple braids that I just got done, so I decided to keep it a little bit more subdued today.  But I really love this collection because one, it's Mel's, and two, I love that she thought of deeper complexions.  After all, the Smooches lip liner is named for her best friend IRL and fellow YouTuber, Kelsey Brianna Jay.  And it's great because if beauty, for example, the nude lippy that I'm wearing right now, if that's a bit too light for you to go in without a liner, it comes in the collection with a deeper liner for us more melanated queens.  Anyway, Mel was kind enough to add me to the PR list.  You know, I don't do much PR because one, it's bad for the environment, and two, I don't want a lot of trash in my PO box.  But as soon as Mel contacted me to ask me if she could send me this collection, I jumped at the chance, and I'm really grateful.  Thank you so much, Mel.  Thank you so much to Christian Odette.  If you've already heard about the collection but were wondering how it might look on someone with brown skin or a deeper complexion, hopefully this is helpful seeing it on me and seeing how I use the products.  And of course, I will link the collection in the description box as I always do with the rest of my makeup details.  It seemed appropriate to me to wear this particular sweater today since I knew I was going to be wearing Mel's lipsticks because Mel also made me buy this sweater.  it's her fault.  i was influenced because i saw mel wearing it in one of her videos.  had to have it bought it in yellow.  some of y'all will have already seen that in a recent video.  now here i am in the ballerina pink color and i love it.  second bit of business before we actually get into this video.  this is for my patrons in the notification squad or the ride or die tier.  in case you didn't see it a couple days ago i put up an announcement that we will be having a patrons only live stream tonight at 5 p.m pacific time today.  i know a lot of you guys missed the other live stream that i did for my patrons this month so i don't want anyone to miss it who's actually interested and available.  so make sure you log into your patreon account so that you can get the link to access that live stream.  and again today sunday at 5 p.m pacific time We gonna kiki live and in person.  Well, not in person, but live.  Okay, let's get into this video.  And the first one, this one really, really crinkles my taint because I fell for it.  Be Nygma.  Remember that?  I can't tell you how many YouTubers in my subscription feed were ranting and raving about how amazing and life-changing this B-Nigma face cream was.  This was maybe three, four years ago and I remember it was a very expensive face cream because as I said, I bought it.  I did wind up sending it back and getting most of my money back because here's one thing about that that really pissed me off.  is not only were clearly all these YouTubers lying because ain't nobody heard about B-Nigma since then, but this face cream was supposed to be so amazing for the skin because it had B-Venom in it and that was supposed to help plump your skin and get rid of texture and provide more moisture and yada, yada, yada.  The ingredients they had on that website were either incomplete or a lie or both because I remember thinking that it looked pretty good on the website.  And then when I got the product, I think fragrance was either very, very high on the ingredients list or it was just obvious to me as soon as I opened the tub of it.  That jar of face cream was probably like this big.  I mean, that is a little, little, teeny tiny jar.  This thing was around $100.  I think it was 80 to 90 bucks, plus shipping.  I'm pretty sure it did not ship free, plus I had to pay to mail it back to them.  Chock full of fragrance, did nothing for my skin.  I was so happy to be able to get at least most of my money back, and I have never, ever forgiven those YouTubers.  Continuing in the vein of products that we never hear about after these YouTubers rant and rave about how much they love it when they're trying it, KKW Beauty or Kylie, the Kylie Childs makeup.  It seems like we hear about these two brands a little bit less nowadays, but that might also be because I've consciously uncoupled from like 90% of the big booty gurus.  But there was a time when, especially with Kylie Cosmetics, every launch, every single booty influencer was kissing so much ass, it was actually sickening.  I concede, it's no secret that I am not the biggest fan of that family.  Nonetheless, the fact that none of these influencers would seem to use these products ever again after doing the video where they would rave about this or that palette, I think that speaks volumes about it being more about them trying to be in those brands' good graces than them being honest with us.  Moving on, we have the Nivea After Shave Balm.  Remember that?  Throwback Sunday.  This one is less shady because NikkieTutorials, who is 100% behind that phenomenon, a credit to her level of influence.  The fact that that aftershave was selling out because everyone was buying it as primer based on NikkieTutorial's makeup hack of using it because it got really tacky or whatever on your skin.  I thought that that was actually pretty remarkable, but how many people are still using men's aftershave to prime their makeup nowadays?  I think approximately 0%.  So this one isn't really about people being disingenuous.  It's more about us.  just moving on as a whole.  I personally never tried the aftershave balm as a primer because I just wasn't interested.  And frankly, it is kind of funny to me just how much of a craze that became.  Again, it speaks volumes about the power and the influence that some of these gurus have.  Anyway, while that is a credit to NikkieTutorials and her influence and reach, I am really glad that that part of YouTube history is behind us.  Number four is another primer, and that is the Milk Blur Stick.  This was probably two years ago or so, but when that product launched from Milk, a whole bunch of influencers were talking about how this primer was the best they'd ever tried, how it was going to change the game, how well it really worked to blur the skin.  I really felt like I was getting inundated with people talking about how bomb this primer was, and yet, No one ever talks about that product now.  It's still around, it's readily available.  So where it at though?  This is one that strikes me as influencers getting paid and possibly not disclosing that they were getting paid to do videos and posts on that product because new products launch all the time.  So for there to be so much focus and enthusiasm on one thing and then for it to just suddenly not be talked about ever again, it smacks of dishonesty and shadiness and probably undisclosed sponsorships.  Number five, another primer.  And this one, I'm not really certain it was shadiness and undisclosed sponsorships and product placements, but it's the Sisley primer.  This one, my memory of it isn't very clear because as soon as I heard of a primer that was over $100, my ears just tuned right out because I wasn't having it.  But again, it seemed like all of a sudden everyone was talking about this overpriced primer that most of their audiences can't afford.  Most of us are not balling out like these influencers are.  And yet again, all of these influencers seem to converge and decide that this was the life-changing primer du jour.  And now we haven't heard about that primer in forever either.  And perhaps it's because they got a lot of backlash for trying to promote something that is so not affordable to almost anyone.  Or maybe even the influencers got tired of paying that price and Sisley probably wasn't sending them the product for free.  Sisley doesn't strike me as a brand that's doing a ton of influencer outreach, to be perfectly honest.  But when that Sicily primer seemed to have its peak popularity, it just struck me as something where influencers were either talking amongst themselves and maybe that's how it gained popularity among them in a more organic way.  And then when they tried to just casually throw that into their get ready with me's and tutorials, they realized that they had completely lost the plot because everyone watching was just like, you, I'm not buying a $100 primer.  Are you nuts?  Number six is going to kind of verge into the Cardassian territory again, but it's actually a product from Charlotte Tilbury.  It's a specific lipstick shade from her and it is the Kim Cardassian West shade.  It's a nude.  I'm sure it's very nice, but there was a time in YouTube history a few years back when it was suspiciously popular.  I feel like it had been out for a couple of months by this point, but there was suddenly this one to two week time span where all of a sudden this lipstick was showing up in every booty guru's favorites videos.  I mean, this is back when it was kind of standard practice for all these gurus to be doing favorites videos.  This was a situation where I remember even the public response noticed that this seemed suspicious and accusations of undisclosed sponsorship and or product placement were definitely thrown.  Some of these booty gurus even countered and denied it.  To this day, I remain suspicious.  I feel like just the fact that, again, it wasn't an especially new lipstick at that time.  You know, the shade had launched a couple months prior, and yet, all of a sudden, in the same week, everyone's talking about how it's their favorite nude of all time.  I call bullshit.  These influencers, man.  Y'all really be trying it.  Y'all ain't slick.  This next one is centered more around the brand trip posts that I saw surrounding this launch, and it just really stuck in my craw because I remember thinking it was incredibly ridiculous even at that time.  It was when Benefit launched some mascara, like bad girl mascara or something, bad girl bang, I don't know.  But the marketing talking points all focused around it having like NASA or like space age technology in a mascara.  No one needs that, baby.  None of us are sitting at home doing our makeup like, you know, I feel like this mascara would be so much better if it had space dust in it.  I reiterate, I don't fully remember what the hell that was, but Just how these influencers were shucking and jiving so hard, trying to make those talking points make sense to us when they were in Bora Bora or whatever.  Like, girl, you're not relatable anymore.  Hang it up.  That was really a turning point for me where I was like, you know what?  It is time for me to like publicly divest from the makeup scene on YouTube.  Number eight, and this one, I'm probably going to catch some heat for this because this is controversial.  The Fenty Foundation.  Pfft.  The first one, the first one.  I know we all love and commend Fendi for coming out of the gate with such an expansive, inclusive range.  Even though to this day, I personally cannot find a shade that looks quite right on me.  Maybe that's why I'm salty, I don't know.  However, I have noticed that since that foundation launched and everyone was talking about how much they loved it.  I can't think of one YouTuber who continued to use that foundation on a regular basis after they did their first impressions or whatever video surrounding the launch, let alone any booty guru who still regularly reaches for or talks about that foundation today.  Now I imagine regular Schmegler everyday people who bought that foundation, you know, continue to use it because we're not getting sent new foundations every week or whatever.  And I'm sure a lot of people still like it.  because that foundation, you know, I think it's still probably a bestseller at Sephora.  I don't really know.  But for something that had such crazy fanfare and fervor.  when it launched, It literally seemed to drop off almost immediately and I hadn't heard about or really thought much about that foundation again until they just launched the hydrating one a month or two ago.  It was only when that foundation came out that people started talking about the old one again and were maybe doing comparison videos to show the different finishes and coverage and how they last and so forth.  But in the two years in between, no one really talked about it.  So I don't know.  It seemed to me that maybe people, again, were wanting to be on the good side of the Fenty brand, on Rihanna's good side, and were maybe hyping up that foundation as something they were going to use more than they wound up actually using it.  Number nine is something up there with the bee enigma.  The Vanity Planet spin for perfect skin.  If I never hear the words Vanity Planet again in life, I will be cool, man.  I'll be fine.  Because the way that that brand flooded YouTube with product placement, it made me never want to get anything from them ever.  It was too doggone much.  Not to mention, this is one of those brands that thinks we're stupid.  Consistently, one of the talking points they'd give to these YouTubers is, oh, this Vanity Planet Spin for Perfect Skin Brush normally sells for $100 or whatever, but With my coupon code, you can get it for 70% off and it's only $30.  We all know good and goddamn well, not a single soul ever paid $100 for that brush.  It's meant to be a budget drugstore, if you will, version of a Clarisonic.  And I don't know what planet they're on, I guess the vanity planet, but no one was ever going to pay $100 for that thing.  So the idea that we're somehow getting some amazing price break at 70% off, like if you're selling something for 70% off, you've actually lowered the perceived value because that's too deep a discount.  At least to me.  To me, it would look better if you said this normally sells for 50 bucks, but we're giving it to you at half price at 25.  Like that to me seems a little bit, a little bit less blatant than trying to convince me that someone out there originally paid $100 for this piece of shit.  Oh, I hope the days of Vanity Planet anything are behind us because I can't with that brand.  Last but not least, we have Michael Todd.  Again, remember them?  Michael Todd was a skincare line and I think they even had their own version of like a less expensive version of the Clarisonic.  But what I mainly remember was YouTubers trying to sell us their masks and stuff.  Fell for this one too.  I definitely remember using their pumpkin enzyme mask.  At one point they were even at Ulta, like they were able to get that big.  And you know, it's just another brand that these YouTubers were swearing up and down that they love, that it's one of their favorite skincare brands, and literally no one ever talks about them anymore.  I say again, we all find new favorites and move on to things that we might like better than old favorites.  But considering how saturated the YouTube beauty scene was with Michael Todd products five, six years ago, it is very peculiar to me that no one, and I mean no one, ever talks about them anymore.  And even though I haven't checked, I have a hunch.  they're probably not even carried at Ulta at this point because I feel like I would have noticed and been like, oh yeah, Michael Todd.  Anyway, that's going to do it for today.  That is just 10 of the far too many times that these booty gurus played us.  It's why I got trust issues today.  And that's why I don't really with the big booty gurus.  No mo.  I just stick to the real ones because like I say at the end of every video, never trust anyone with a morphe code.  That's why I stick to my girls, Mel, Alicia, Kinky Sweat, Kelsey Brianna J, Laura Mae Beauty.  To be perfectly honest, you can tell who's real and who's not on YouTube in a heartbeat.  That's enough of that.  Thank you for keeping me company.
