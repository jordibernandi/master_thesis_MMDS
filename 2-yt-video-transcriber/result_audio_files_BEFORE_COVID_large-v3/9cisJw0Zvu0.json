            "text": "shalom israel.  it's your boy new breed coming through with another video and welcome to the cool out corner aka the lions den.  from this undisclosed location.  you're going to be getting a lot of open broadcasts.  you're going to be getting a lot of blogs live streams uploads videos etc.  so get used to the scenery.  Now, before I even dive into this topic, shout out Rima word clothing, the clothing that ministers.  As you can see, I'm rocking the Qam Yasharallah, which means rise Israel, which it says both on there.  It says Qam Yasharallah, rise Israel.  And I'm telling you, this is the flyest clothing in the nation.  So if you feel in this outfit along with a variety of others, make sure you click on the link in the description box.  There'll also be a link in the comment section as well.  So come check us out.  And pretty soon, a new breed brand along with Rima Word Clothing will be doing a collaboration project.  And I want to clarify, it's not a partnership, but it will be a collaboration.  And that'll be a future project to look out for.  Now what I want to talk about in this video is being prepared to walk alone.  Being prepared to walk alone.  Now I find this video quite important because on this channel.  we talk about the isolation and loneliness agenda.  We talk about the life of a loner.  And I want to talk about preparing to walk alone.  Because there are a lot of people out here who figured out that they prefer to be alone.  Which I see a lot of that among this channel.  A lot of my subscribers, they prefer to actually be alone.  Which that's sort of out of the ordinary when you look at it.  And so I decided to make a video addressing those people who absolutely are terrified, petrified, and they loathe The idea of being alone.  Now I find this important because we realize that being alone is actually a time where you come into fruition and understanding, wisdom.  The ministering angels are able to speak with you in your time of being alone.  The most high is able to give you certain knowledge.  You're able to take a step back from everybody and look from the outside looking in and you're able to decipher who your friends are and your enemies.  you'll begin to see people and how they move.  you'll begin to understand why you should veer away from certain individuals and this is important.  This is very important to gain that sort of clarity because I'm going to tell you now, some of us, we need to take a step back because you don't know what people have planned.  You don't know the ill will and ill intentions that people may have planned for you.  So sometimes you just fall back and really see how people begin to move.  But I want to talk about preparing to walk alone because I understand the mentality of a person who just does not want to be alone.  You have people out here who cannot help but to be social, can't help but to walk in a crowd, to mix, mingle, and just have a huge crowd around them.  Now, a lot of the times, and I'm not saying all of the times, But a lot of the times when people are like this, they actually fear being alone.  They fear being alone.  And I'm gonna tell you why.  They actually have issues that's embedded that they are afraid to address.  It's their selves that they are afraid to face.  And that's very important.  See, we're living in times of spiritual warfare.  Satan, the enemy, Lucifer, he's doing his best to keep you distracted.  See, in times of old, there was a lot less technology.  There were people walking in the wilderness, deserts, being alone, isolated.  And these people had way more spiritual revelations.  Some of the greatest inventions and greatest advances in mankind came from people who spent a lot of time isolating because they were then able to come to terms with their own battles that they faced themselves.  And then they were also able to work the left-right paradigm within the brain, able to invent and create And this is very important.  It promotes creativity when one is left alone.  It also helps you exercise those personal demons that we all battle with.  Because you have nowhere to run to.  You have no one to talk to.  Now you have to absolutely open yourself up for the Heavenly Father to begin to minister to you.  You have to face reality.  And there's a lot of people out here who are afraid to do this.  And I think it's important that I speak to those individuals as well.  Because you gotta realize, the days we living in, there's a lot more pressure being put out there in the atmosphere.  People are becoming a lot more dangerous to be around.  There are so many people walking among us with narcissistic tendencies.  The programming and the agenda has created envious people who are homicidal maniacs, to be honest with you.  People that are calling you brother and sister, a lot of these people, they're harboring hatred in their heart, envy, jealousy.  And the only way that you can begin to realize this, is if you take a step back and spend some time alone.  And also, why it's important to prepare to walk alone.  Why it's important to prepare to walk alone.  And I'm gonna say this, overall, when it's all said and done, all the real, we will come together.  We will be together.  But right now you got to go through the purging period.  You got to go through the period of refining yourself and fine tuning yourself.  So why it's important to walk alone is because you got to understand this.  Nothing in the fleshly realm is permanent.  Nothing in the fleshly realm is permanent.  Nothing.  only thing that's permanent is the spiritual realm your soul your spirit.  that's the only thing that lives eternally.  so your focus should be critiquing that preparing that and people tend to get put all their stock put all their hope their faith all their energy is concerted into relationships Especially in modern times with men.  Men desire to have marriages.  A lot of women have lots of options.  But a lot of men grow depressed putting their whole stock and their everything, their whole entire soul is buried upon a relationship.  Even for brothers and sisters who've been married for 20, 30 years.  Just know that that relationship will come to an end one day.  Somebody's going to die.  Your flesh is temporary.  We all got to face death.  Somebody might just want to pack up and leave you.  Do you want to be that person that is so wounded that you're going to get suicidal because a failed relationship, because a person decided to pack up and leave?  Are you going to be a person who is up stagnated in life?  Because of a relationship?  See, that's why it's important to prepare to be alone sometimes.  That's why it's important to go and be alone.  See things spiritually.  Because you just never know with people.  People can leave you high and dry and there's only a few ways that you can take it.  You can take it as, okay, you know, I've been left alone.  I don't know what to do.  You can feel lost in this world if you're a person who puts all your stock in relationships and people and groups.  What are you going to do when you have to stand on your own is the question.  What are you going to do when you have to stand on your own?  And again, let me repeat this.  All the righteous in this earth, all the people who are fine tuning, critiquing their spirits and their souls, coming to grips with themselves, fighting with the man in the mirror.  One day, all of us will be together.  All of us brothers and sisters who stand for truth, who is not afraid to face ourselves and battle within our own spirits.  and allow the father to give us his understanding and wisdom, we'll one day be together and we'll be prepared to be together because by the time we're together, we have already learned basic human things that will help us jail and get alone.  We will learn the empathy.  We would basically know how others are thinking and feeling.  Because when you spend a lot of time alone, your empathy grows.  You can feel others.  You know when somebody is going through something.  You know when you got to console a brother or sister.  These are traits that actually come from being alone.  A lot of times when people are always around others, there's always drama.  Because there's too many people.  There's too many personalities mixed in there.  There's too many different agendas mixed in there.  And when there's smoke, there will be fire.  So, this message overall is for people who are used to being social, who want to really start a spiritual journey.  Am I telling anybody in this video to isolate yourself and stay away from everybody and close off?  No.  You can start with building blocks.  Sometimes it's healthy to just get up, leave out, go eat dinner alone, go see a movie alone.  Do something by yourself.  This will bring you to the next level spiritually.  This will begin to help you come to coach with who you are.  Not worrying about what others think and things of that nature.  And really just begin to manifest more spiritually.  That's the goal.  And I just thought I'd come through with that video, this video to, you know, kind of help you out with this midday motivational talk.  Hopefully this edified you.  For those who are subscribed to the channel, make sure you turn that notification bell on in the corner.  All right.  And if this video edified you, make sure you hit the thumbs up.  I'd like to thank y'all for viewing.  With that being said, shalom and peace. ",
