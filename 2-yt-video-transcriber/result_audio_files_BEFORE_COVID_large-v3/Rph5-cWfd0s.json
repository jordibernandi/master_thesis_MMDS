            "text": "Y'all.  How y'all living?  Checking in with y'all real quick too.  What's going on out there in continental west?  What's up, y'all?  Y'all having a good time this weekend?  Y'all chilling?  No, it's not the weekend.  My day's all off.  It's Monday.  Shit.  I'm thinking it's the weekend.  It's not a weekend.  Feels like it.  What's up in Philly?  Shout out to Philly.  There we go.  That's much better.  What's up, Kiera Brooks?  What's up, Court Court?  How are you, dear?  I was checking in with y'all.  I hope y'all checked out my last broadcast last night.  The data.  Is it difficult to hear?  Can you guys hear me?  Or is this nigga trying to watch me on a T-Mobile sidekick?  Knowing good and well ain't?  no sound and it don't stream.  What's up, Corcoran?  How you been, dear?  I'm still in Hawaii.  I'm still in Hawaii chilling.  Don't see that beautiful background back there.  I'm under my thought tree right here.  This is why I come and I do a lot of writing under this tree.  I've been writing under this tree right here in Hawaii for 20 years.  I come here and the thoughts flow.  It's like one of my little spots out here.  I come out here and I get busy with the creativity.  That's my little thought tree right here.  This right here.  Always got to come here and get my shit right.  That album is coming fly.  The first single on the album is a song called Guest List.  Hot as hell.  That next slide album is going to pop off.  Ladies, if you're in  L.A.,  y'all going to have to come down and be in the video.  The first video we're going to do is going to be all ladies.  Ain't going to have all the niggas out there.  We had a gang of invited people, and they look like a Malik Yoba video.  It's a gang of niggas.  Too many fucking niggas.  We got to get some ladies up in here.  All ladies on the new video.  We're going to have all ladies.  Shout out to New England.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So, yeah, bunk breaking.  We're going to start filming that in a minute.  So, we're getting busy.  Yeah, I'm out here in the cut, so hopefully ain't nobody going to pull up on my ass.  I better watch my back.  Shout out to the couple last night.  They were cool.  But as you can see, I'd be fucking around and get caught slipping if I had real enemies.  I don't have no real enemies like that.  But just, you never know.  You know, I always got to be on my P's and Q's.  You know, I'd be broadcasting.  I'd be forgetting shit.  I'd be thinking, okay, I'm out here in the middle of the damn Pacific Ocean.  Everything is going to be all gravy and knob.  Folks will push up on you when you least expect it.  You know?  But no, the people, they were real cool.  Now, Peanut, they're coming out here tomorrow.  Peanut and the kids and everybody, I'm bringing them out here tomorrow.  Yeah, so they'll be out here tomorrow.  What's up, Las Vegas in the house?  Shout out to Vegas.  How I feel about the Ghana return?  Well, it was like, um... It brought a lot of tourism money to Ghana.  I know that.  Shout out to them.  Ain't got a problem with that.  But it brought a lot of tourism money to Ghana.  And that's cool for what it is.  You know, right now, I really focus on us getting our shit right.  I really focus on Foundational Black Americans really understanding who we are and standing on that and using that to build our power base, which is very important.  And fresh.  Excuse me.  Rick the Terminator.  Boy, this sunset is beautiful as hell right there, ain't it?  You know?  Didn't Ludacris get dual citizenship?  I don't think it was Ghana.  I think Ludacris got dual citizenship in another country, and I think that's based on his wife.  His wife is from over there.  You know?  Something like that.  There's a lot of y'all in here.  Y'all got to come to Hawaii at least.  You don't need your passport.  It ain't that.  Yeah, it wasn't Ghana.  It wasn't Ghana.  A word on prosperous roots?  So Paul's real name is Matt O'Brien?  Well, I'm going to look into that.  We're going to find out who he is.  Because y'all see that I've already exposed the ADOS chick, Bakara Johnson.  We've already exposed that.  And I told people her ass worked at a federal facility.  Her ass out there working at a federal facility at the National Conference of State Legislators.  So we got in touch with her supervisors and all that for accessing those federal servers, getting private information and damaging information and putting that shit out.  So, yeah, that's some real serious shit right there.  So they crying foul right now, you know, strappy and toned.  They out there crying foul because their little bullshit backfired on them.  Old girl is in very hot water right now.  She's lucky she don't get criminal charges with that shit.  she did using those federal damn servers to pull that shit and post online in a malicious fashion.  Yeah, she's real quiet now.  She ain't talking all that big shit on Twitter now, is she?  Oh, she's not talking that big shit no more, huh?  Huh?  That just shows, man, they unraveling.  They were a con game from top to bottom.  And let me tell y'all something.  If y'all went to any of those damn ADOS events, understand your name is on some list somewhere.  They got these people working with the federal fucking government.  that we proved, we proved that they work with the damn federal government sitting up here at these damn meetings while Tony's slobbering all over the place and Yvette's strap-on is bumping into people.  So your name, if you went to an ADOS event, your name is on some damn list somewhere.  You dig?  That's what it is.  I see one of the Bussy Brothers in here.  I see you in here, Bussy Brother.  I see you in here, Bussy Brother, trying to get me to comment towards your ass, and I'm not.  I see you, Bussy Brother.  What's up, Organic Vianna?  Vianna?  Man.  But I have to go back to my hotel, man.  I got to do some more writing and stuff.  Just enjoy this beautiful sunset going down over here.  So I'm going to go live a little bit later on, man.  So y'all holla. ",
