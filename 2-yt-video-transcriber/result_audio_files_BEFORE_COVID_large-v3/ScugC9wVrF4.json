I'd command thee sing, be it fish or fowl, with a woof, and a woof, and a royal dowel.  As I'd click my heel, all the trees would kneel, and the mountains bow, the bulls howl, and the sparrow would take wing.  Fie!  working.  Each rabbit would show respect to me.  The chipmunks genuinely reflect to me.  Though my tail would lush, I would show compash for every underling. ",

Not no how.  Not even a rhinoceros?  Imposterous.  How about a hippopotamus?  Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottom.  Supposing you met an elephant?  I'd wrap him up in cellophane.  What if it were a brontosaurus?  I'd show him who was king of the forest.  How?  How?  Courage.  What makes a king out of a slave?  Courage.  What makes the flag on the mast to wave?  Courage.  What makes the elephant charge his tusk in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?  What makes the muskrat guard his musk?  Courage.  What makes the sphinx the seventh wonder?  Courage.  What makes the dawn come up like thunder?  Courage.  Hello, everyone. ",

Today, I would like to talk about the differences between a prince and a king, just like I did before between a princess and a queen.  prince, king, princess, queen.  Now, I'm not a man.  But like I said, I think I'm just already defending myself between some of you little meanie pants.  I've never been the type of person who has the logic of, if you're not a man, you can't talk about men.  If you're. ",
