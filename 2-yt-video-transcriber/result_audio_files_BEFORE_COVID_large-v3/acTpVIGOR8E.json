            "text": "Telling the story of Southern California without the orange would be like trying to explain how Disneyland succeeded without Mickey Mouse, or the history of modern aviation without the Wright brothers.  Southern California and the citrus industry once enjoyed a mutual symbiotic relationship that brought countless numbers of citrus farmers to the state in the early 1900s to partake in what was known as the Second Gold Rush, and its immigrant workforce was the key to making the entire operation work.  The first commercial citrus orchard in California was planted in 1841, but the industry didn't really take off until 1873, when the U.S.  Department of Agriculture mailed two small Washington naval orange trees to this woman, Eliza Tibbetts, one of the early settlers and founders of Riverside, California.  Word quickly spread of Tibbetts' delicious golden oranges, especially regarding their ability to adapt to the Southern California climate.  In just a 10-year span from 1875 to 1885, the citrus industry in California went from some 90,000 trees to a staggering 2 million, and then doubling to 4.5 million trees in 1901.  By 1893, Riverside had become the wealthiest city per capita in the United States, and dozens of new citrus-growing communities were formed, including Rialto, Fontana, Bloomington, Redlands, Loma Linda, and Corona, to name a few.  This new California gold was initially farmed by native California Indians, but destructive policies passed by the US government, fueled by public prejudice, led to a decline in the workforce.  At the end of the 19th century, the Native Americans were mostly replaced by Chinese immigrants whose horticulture skills and knowledge made them a valuable asset to the industry.  Unfortunately, once again U.S.  policies fueled by anti-Chinese sentiment, particularly the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, delivered a shocking blow to this new immigrant workforce.  Japanese immigrants soon filled the gap and at the turn of the century roughly 3,000 Japanese workers were employed in the citrus farms of Riverside, California.  In fact, from 1900 to 1920, they were the largest of any labor group in the entire citrus industry.  However, if you've been following the pattern here, then you won't be shocked to learn that yet again, this new immigrant workforce soon declined due to anti-immigrant sentiment.  In the 1920s, a rebellion against the imposition of secularist and anti-Catholic articles in Mexico's constitution led to over 450,000 Mexican citizens immigrating to the United States.  This near-perfect timing allowed thousands of Mexican American workers to fill the new void in California's citrus industry, and by the 1940s, Hispanics made up two-thirds of the entire workforce.  Today, the spirit and legacy of Tibbets Washington navel orange is beautifully preserved at the 250-acre California Citrus State Historic Park in Riverside.  Here, you can learn more about the important role the citrus industry played in Southern California's early days, especially how it provided a way of living for many Chinese, Japanese, and Hispanic immigrants who shaped new communities as they settled and grew families in California.  For a small $5 entry fee, you'll have access to the beautiful trails, guided tours, picnic grounds, and an informative visitor center.  Whether you live in the area or you're just visiting, your Southern California experience will not be complete until you check out California Citrus State Historic Park.
