So please, please keep watching because we know that some of you like to turn off.  We just want to see the calamities that are happening.  And that's okay, but we'd really appreciate if you keep watching.  So we want to show you now the mission work that's funded by the viewers.  And it's in Pakistan, which is the fifth most dangerous country in the entire world for Christians.  There's a lot of persecution going on there.  So yeah, just take a look at the latest mission work.  Okay people, we normally play music over it, but I think this week we really felt, actually Chris suggested it, he says, let's talk over the photos.  So I think the first thing that I'd like to say is that we are really, really inspired and super, super excited to do this mission work.  We have a wonderful mission director in Pakistan, We have a team of about 28 people.  Some days, some days, people, we actually conduct three missions on the same day.  And each mission may be three or four, you know, people.  And that could be like there's carriers, there's a photographer and, you know, there's a lead pastor or an evangelist.  And it's all going really, really well.  And again, you know, you guys are cheering us on.  You're you're.  you're funding um you know this work and it's it's.  it's going so well and i know that we keep showing this stuff week after week.  but don't take it for granted don't get accustomed to it like it's always going to happen because you know we've got a door open at the moment.  we can we can work and we just want to take advantage of that.  and i'll also say that i know that we do the food missions but the real food people the real food is giving out the word of God.  Giving out Bibles is super, super important.  I don't think enough Bibles are really being given out in the UK.  And I'd say in America, I think it's, what do you think, Chris?  I think it's a bit overlooked, isn't it?  We're not really focused. ",
