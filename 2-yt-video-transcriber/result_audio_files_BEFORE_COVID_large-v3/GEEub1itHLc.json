But don't you, but when you were 18 years old, did you believe in the Bible?  Of course I did.  Okay, let me tell you what the Bible, let me tell you what the Bible says.  No, I don't know.  Let me just share some scripture.  You believe in God?  Yeah, but you know, God doesn't look at skin color.  Let me share some scripture with you.  I'm not.  Don't worry about it.  No, no, no.  God doesn't look at skin color like that.  I didn't say it was skin color.  It's about ethnicity.  That's not the God that I want to be around if he's going to judge me.  So do you reject the God of the Bible?  Of course I don't.  Okay, so let's see what the God of the Bible has to say.  I'm not going to be judged by you guys or by anybody that you know.  Yeah, y'all are sad, man.  Okay, how are we?  No, you're sad.  You came at us.  You're really ignorant.  You're sad.  I'm ignorant because I love black people.

Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Is it wrong that we wanna protest the unjust killings of black people?  That's not wrong, but what's wrong?  that you came at us sideways?  Why is he calling us ignorant for protesting black power?  Because you came at me sideways.  How's it sideways?  We were walking by and that's all it was.  If we want you with a black man, how is that ignorant?  Right.  You can't come at me at a different angle.  There's a different way to do it, guys.  You guys are stupid.  Okay, okay.  Can you please leave that cracker and get with your own people?  You're saying that you lied that I said a bad word?  And then you say it, man.  And get with your own people?  We want you with your own people.  You guys are a bunch of liars.  You guys are a bunch of liars.  You're going to be race wars and race rights.  You don't want to be with that white boy with the race rights.  Hey, boy.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Don't let them talk to these black kings like that.
