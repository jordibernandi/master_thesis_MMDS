            "text": "Good evening, brethren.  This is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, I want to give all praises to the Most High, Yehawah.  I also want to give acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother.  Okay, who is wisdom?  Who is the Holy Spirit?  I also want to give acknowledgement to Yehawashai.  Pray to the Most High, blesses this lesson tonight.  Gives us more clarification to some of the prophecies that are coming on this Earth.  And one thing I wanted to talk about was, um, it was put on me a couple of days ago.  I've been kind of preparing for another video, but then, um, a couple of days ago, most high kind of put it on me to, uh, look at a little, a couple of things from Albert Pike.  And if you don't know who Albert Pike is, I was just maybe doing a little bit of research.  Cause this, uh, this person here was dealing with seriously dealing with, uh, demons.  And the demons allowed him to see a glimpse of the future.  And he predicted the first three world wars.  And this is actually a pretty good video.  I'll leave the link in the description.  It's a really short one, but it kind of gives you a little taste of the information.  I think he wrote a letter in 1871 breaking down the three world wars.  And I was kind of looking at some of this right now, and something stuck out to me about the Third World War and what it was going to do at the end.  And how when you know the truth about who we are, where our land is, and about all the other books and the information that's been hidden, then when you start to hear things about what they were saying, what Albert Pike was told by these demons, it all starts to make sense.  Now, as I said, that the Most High is going to pretty much expel all of the people who are not supposed to be in our lands.  And everyone's going to go back to their lands.  And then once they go back to their lands, they're going to be fighting one another.  Now, when you listen to Albert Pike and his breakdown of World War III, You're going to see how that corresponds almost exactly the way that these prophecies are playing out.  Now, you know, many of the people are going to be just surprised because, you know, the truth is so far from the vast majority of the world's minds.  They're still stuck with everything revolving around the so-called Middle East and the so-called Arabs over there and the so-called Jewish people over there.  Everything is revolving around them, and people are not really taking account as to what is transpiring right here under their noses.  So we're just going to listen to a little bit of this video clip.  And I'm going to stop it as we go through it, kind of show you the breakdown of this Third World War's prophecy from Albert Pike through the eyes of the Hebrews with the help of the Holy Spirit guiding us and giving us real clarification as to what's going to be transpiring during this time of World War III.  As we can see, we're at the precipice.  of huge things with Iran actually taking, confiscating ships from Britain right now.  And the United States saying they shot down a drone and then the Iranians, you know, showing that they didn't shoot it down.  I mean, there's all this information now that these other nations are now standing up and they're not afraid anymore, which is all part of Bible prophecy as well as other prophecies from other books as well.  Let's continue.  Let's take a look here at this video. ",

During the Second World War, international communism must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for final social cataclysm.  The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the agenture of the Illuminati between the political Zionists and the leaders of the Islamic world.  The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam, the Muslim Arabic world, and political Zionism, the State of Israel, mutually destroy each other. ",

            "text": "Okay, so they set up Israel with the Second World War.  They set up Christianity.  in the second world war.  So to make sure that they're ready to use those two entities for the third world war.  So all of this has all been planned.  You know, so you have your, you have your Islamic faction, you have your Islamic side right here.  You've got your, you've got your Christendom and you've got your Zionism on the other side, and they're going to be made to fight each other to utter exhaustion.  Now, remember now, when we talked about how the Molossai is going to make everyone go back to their lands, if you go to 2 Ezra chapter 15, it talks about how he's going to make them fight one another.  Let me see.  I don't even have this book right here.  No, I don't even have it.  But they're going to be fighting.  Everyone's going to be turning against each other and fighting with one another.  That's all talked about in 2 Ezra chapter 15, which is exactly what's going to be going on right here.  Everyone's going to have to pick a side, and they're going to be fighting with each other and destroying each other, so they just destroy one another.  Remember, we're going to be in our own lands, and the Most High is going to be protecting us there.  He's going to be renewing the lands there.  He's going to be protecting us with the angels there, and they're going to be just destroying each other.  And as you can tell by looking at the news, that's exactly what we're on the doorstep of.  Everyone picking sides.  Everyone's got their, they've got their, they've got the enemies that they're set up, And they got their comrades they're going to get together and work with.  You know, so that's what's going on right now.  Everyone's picking their sides.  Everyone's setting up their teams, getting their allies together because this is going to pop off.  But this is all based off of us awakening to who we are and to where our inheritance is.  You know, many people and still in the Hebrew community are still stuck on Africa and the Middle East.  And they're sleeping on the fact that we're already in our own lands.  But many people are now awakening to the truth because they're starting to see that as we bring out this information, me and myself and the other brethren, there's many brethren that are bringing out a lot of information.  And one brother I forgot to actually mention on the last video was UB News.  That brother brings out a lot of great information as well.  But as our brethren and I come together, working together, bringing up this knowledge and information, bringing up this information through the power of the Holy Spirit, so now things are going to start to fall into play.  Now things are going to start to make much more sense.  Even when you're listening to Albert Pike and the things, his prophecies of what he thought was going to happen.  and what he was shown was going to happen, but we need to know what's the underlying current.  Why are these things happening?  Let's continue with this video a little more. ",

And that's exactly what he's going to be doing on a grand scale right now.  Because this is all, like you said, this is all, everything's just playing itself out the way the multi said it was going to play out.  Let's continue. ",

As you can tell, people are already losing faith in Christianity because once they start to really analyze, you know, the tenets of Christianity, of Constantine, I say Constantine Christianity, and you start to get questioned on certain things and they have no answers.  Many people are starting to realize that the foundation of their religion is based on a pile of sand.  that is quickly being destroyed, especially now as we rise and the real true people of the book rise and we, you know, claim our books and our understanding back.  They realize that, you know, their people can't, can't hold a candle to us as far as knowledge and understanding because the books were never given to them in the first place.

            "text": "Now, this is huge.  This is where, you know, you know that the truth coming out as far as who we are, our lands are, our inheritance is, is huge.  What he just said right there is, shows you how this happens.  What can destroy Christianity and atheism at the same time?  Let that sink in for a second.  That question, what is, what can happen that could destroy Christianity and atheism at the same time.  I'll tell you exactly what can destroy both at the same time.  The Most High waking up his people, empowering his people.  The whole world realizing that those Israelis over there were not God's chosen people.  But the people that we've had under our thumb, that we've had our boots on their necks this entire time, the people that we've had at the bottom this whole time were God's chosen people.  That will destroy Christianity in an instant.  Because Christianity is already based off of a deck of cards.  And, you know, a good strong wind blowing those cards all over the place will destroy that.  the whole basis of Christianity being set up over a fake people.  And they've been blessing the wrong people this entire time.  That would absolutely destroy Christianity in an instant.  What would destroy atheism in an instant?  When they see the father crack them clouds open, crack the skies open, And they see what he really looks like.  And they realize who his people really are.  And they're seeing our people being gathered from the four corners back into their lands.  Every knee will bow.  Every knee will understand.  Every person at that time will understand that there is a God or a power.  And he's the power of the true Hebrews.  That would then make it without a doubt that there is a power.  up in the heavens.  So us being restored, the Most High sending his angels out and collecting our people from the four corners, bringing them back into our land, will destroy Christianity and atheism at the same time.  And then once that happens, then the Most High has the other nations fighting and destroying themselves.  until he decides to send his son back.  And the other nations are then summoned.  when the Most High puts that hook in their jaw and tells them to come back over here again to the Holy Lands and try to do what they did the first time.  He's gonna put that in their minds to do that again.  You know, when they realize that they're gonna be back in these desolate lands and they don't have any resources and they're gonna see us, you know, living happily in our lands and they're gonna be, you know, coaxed to come back over again.  When they come back the second time though, they're gonna have to deal with our power because at that time he's going to fight for us.  He's known to his people and to the rest of the world.  So Albert Pike was shown many things, but without the understanding of who we are and where we come from, the interpretation of his, of his, of his, uh, you know, his letters can go all over the place.  Because they're missing the biggest point.  The biggest point is his people have been hidden.  And without the understanding of who the most highest people really are, all prophecy is going to be off.  If you're still stuck on, you know, I see this even a lot within the Hebrew community.  They're still talking about, you know, well, this is the beginning of Jacob's trouble.  We've been going through Jacob's trouble for thousands of years.  When I'm reading the accounts out of that, you know, the Dogs of the Conquest book and showing you the things that they were doing to our people.  You know, you start looking at the accounts of what happened to us in slavery and gator bait and everything else.  Selling off of our kids and, you know, all the things, all the curses that we've already gone through.  So what you're saying is that we have to go through this again for another seven years?  Yes.  I mean, what more could the nations do that they haven't already done to us for the last four to 500 years?  You see, that's just, that's like Christianity, pretty much all the things that Christianity has told us.  Then when people give into the truth and they try to force, you know, the Hebrew Israel community to follow what we were told in Christianity, you know, people still talking about, you know, um, going through seven year tribulation period about still taking a mark of the beast.  We've been marked before we got here.  We were marked either to be for the most high or against them before we even were conceived in the womb.  That's already been decided.  Saying we're going to go through another tribulation period.  I said, we've been going through tribulation.  We're going through tribulation every day already.  We're now at the time where we're waiting for our father to make things plain, to show himself to the other nations, to show himself to two-thirds of our people who refuse to believe the truth, who still fight with us, you know, at every turn.  We're waiting for the Most High to restore our spiritual power that we had once before.  We're waiting for him to make us the nation that he intended us to be in the first place.  I'm not trying to make the Hebrew Israelites fit into our awakening, fit into Christianity and the way that they've tried to break things down.  Everything revolves around us and our awakening and the depth that our awakening goes to.  Some people are just happy with knowing that, hey, you know, we're Hebrews.  Well, there's much more to us than just that.  Our inheritance is also a big part of this awakening as well.  But I wanted to kind of just go over this really quick with the old Albert Pike and the way he was breaking down World War III.  And he's talking about how the other nations are going to be fighting to exhaustion.  Yes, that's talked about in 2nd and just 15.  Talking about how Christianity and atheism are going to be destroyed.  You know, they're both going to be destroyed at the same time.  Yes.  once we are restored and they see who the real people are and they see our power fighting for us, they're going to know that there is a God or there is a power who controls everything.  And they're going to realize that, you know, that we are the real true children of the most high and that they've been lied to and all their Christian churches.  You imagine that day, you imagine that, The utter chaos that's going to cause for the vast majority of the people in the world when they realize that everything that they've been taught has been an absolute lie.  That day is upon us, brethren.  All praises to the Most High, Yahuwah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yahuwah Shai.  Shalom. ",
