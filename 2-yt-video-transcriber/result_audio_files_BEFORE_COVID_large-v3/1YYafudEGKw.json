You got your tickets from St.  Louis.  That's what's up.  Oh, man.  Oh, man, let's get it popping.  There's so much stuff we got to talk about.  Today's talk, the main theme, I want to talk about some blood quantum laws and rules that foundational black Americans might need to get.  See, we gotta start cleaning up a lot of the mess that's going on out here.  We need to start cleaning up a lot of the mess that's happening out here.  Right now, family, we gotta get very serious.  We gotta start circling our wagons.  We really gotta get on code here.  It's good that we are letting other people hold their own nuts, because when things happen to us, I've posted a few videos of black people getting ambushed by these race soldiers.  And I'm gonna show y'all some of the things that I've posted.  But I'm noticing a lot of these outsiders, and I'm talking about just non-black and most of them non-black, these non-black outsiders, really getting their little pigs in, co-signing white supremacist terrorism against us, and then we're told by our fake black non-leaders, because we don't have black leaders, we have puppet Negroes that are propped up by the white supremacists to sabotage black society.  And everybody's going on a little tizzy about Trump.  Trump made some comments about Baltimore.  And, you know, the Democrats, they're using this.  They're trying to run with this to try to get some mileage out of it.  Like, ooh, look at how Trump is so racist to us black and brown people.  See, this is why all of us need to stick together because of Trump.  Trump is coming after all of us black and brown people.  Family, don't fall for that.  Don't fall for that con game.  Elijah Cummings and all these people are going back and forth with Trump.  Elijah Cummings has the cape on for immigrant groups.  He's a non-factor when it comes to black people.  We're not falling for that.  Now, I've had to G-check a couple of the MAGA crowd people.  You know, we had to reel them in because, see, what they like to do, the Democrats and the Republicans, they like to play this game of racial hot potato.  They like to point the finger at each other, talking about each other's racism.  Both parties are run by hardcore white supremacists.  Both parties have a selection of coons and butter biscuit eaters that they place and prop up.  And we can call out both.  Now, the thing is, some of these MAGA Negroes, they'll sit up and call the racism out for the Democrats, but basically, they're sucking the balls of the MAGA crowd, and you're no better.  You're still a Sambo.  See, that's the thing.  We got to watch this stuff.  And most of those MAGA Negroes, damn near 98% of them are some of these immigrant niggas.  Damn near all of them.  are these niggas with first or second gen immigrants or anchor babies at the most.  Damn near all of them.  All of the MAGA Negroes.  See, this is why I'm going to get into that blood quantum thing a little later.  The Democrats, I don't want to hear nothing about them talking about how racist Trump is.  Yeah, we know that, but you're no better.  You're no better.  We're just getting racism from multiple groups coming from the left.  So we still got to stay on code.  We're not going to let them play racial hot potato.  And, you know, they got that Negro on CNN, Victor Blackwell, is that his name?  They had him on CNN crying because Trump made some disparaging remarks about Baltimore.  He's on there crying like his pussy is itching.  And let me play the clip.  And CNN love these crying Negroes.  They love these buck-broken Negroes.  They love that.  They love that.  Hold on.  Okay, let me play this dude.  Hold on one second.  This is Victor on CNN crying.
