            "text": "The truth is you will never win in life by being someone you are not.  You cannot ever live the life of your dreams by settling for someone else's idea of what you should be doing with your life.  You will never, ever be happy if you change who you are to fit in with others.  Until you accept and embrace who you are, you are destined to live a life at only a mere fraction of your potential.  It is simply impossible to be genuinely happy when you are not genuinely yourself.  You must be yourself if you want to experience your true purpose in life.  If you're different, be different.  Be different and do it with pride.  If someone doesn't like it, if many people don't like it, who cares?  Those aren't the people for you.  There is better.  The right people will show up when the real you comes out.  There will always be someone prettier.  There will always be someone smarter, stronger, richer, younger.  but there will never be another you.  Kurt Cobain once said, I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not.  The truth is, you will never be hated by the right people for being real.  Being real, being yourself, is the greatest filter you could ever use.  It instantly filters out all the people that don't belong with you.  And at the same time, it reveals those who do.  Bob Marley once said, the only problem is people are being hated when they are real and loved when they are fake.  It's true.  But what is missed here is one very important fact.  The people that are hating people being real are fake people.  And the people that are loving fake people are the same fake people.  Real recognizes real.  Real recognizes fake.  So who do you want to attract?  Fake people or real people?  Be yourself.  And I promise you, eventually you will attract the right people.  Be yourself.  No matter what has happened to you, no matter who has hurt you, no matter what you believe, be yourself and be kind to others.  If you do that, life will turn out far greater than you ever thought possible.  If you don't, life will be painful.  Because living a life with a mask on, you can't see.  Living a life trying to fit in, you will never.  Living a life trying to be someone else so other people will like you, you might fit in on the outside.  But inside, you'll never be complete.  You'll never be happy.  Repeat to yourself every day, I am different.  That is why I win.  I am unique.  And that is why I am great.  I'm not like anyone else on this planet.  I am grateful for who I am becoming.  I am grateful for who I am.  I am committed to be myself and speak my truth at all times.  And I know that is the only time the right people will show up in my life.  Those who are meant for me will love and support and be real with the real me.  I'm done with fake people.  And that includes a fake version of me.  I will stand tall and stand strong in my purpose, in everything that matters to me.  I'm different.  That is why I win.  I am different.  That is why I win.  I am unique.  And that is why I am great.  I'm not like anyone else on this planet.  I am grateful for who I am becoming.  I am grateful for who I am.  I am committed to be myself and speak my truth at all times.  And I know that is the only time the right people will show up in my life.  Those who are meant for me will love and support and be real with the real me.  I'm done with fake people, and that includes a fake version of me.  I will stand tall and stand strong in my purpose.  In everything that matters to me, I'm different.  That is why I win.  I am me.  That is why I win.  I am different.  Different with pride.  If you're different, be different.  Be different with pride.  Thank you. ",
