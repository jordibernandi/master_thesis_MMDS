            "text": "What two sides would you like with that?  Well, I don't bloody think I can take two sides.  I mean, if you agree one side is right, you're necessarily suggesting the other is wrong.  It's like, what, do you think a person can believe something is true and false at the same time?  Do you honestly believe that?  That's bloody post-modern neo-Marxism, man.  And if you ever want to rescue your father from the belly of the well, you had- Why well stop speaking mistruths.  you know to be mistruths?  I just work here.  Oh, you just work here, huh?  Well, we're all going to be just working at a bloody gulag if you don't clean your room.  Spare any change?  That's a complicated question, man.  I mean, what kind of change are we discussing here?  It's true that all progress is change, but it bloody well isn't the case that all change is progress, I can tell you that much.  It's like, oh, you want to go out and change the world?  Well, how do you know you're not gonna mess it all up?  After all, you're a bloody chimpanzee full of snakes.  Something approximating that.  So how about before going out and trying to meddle with the entire society around you, you do a little introspective work and look at yourself before you end up with a dirty room and get us all sent off to the gulag.  Gimme all your money!  Well, what puts you at the top of the dominance hierarchy all of a sudden?  You think holding people at gunpoint is a practical, long-term solution to your problems, don't ya?  It's like, okay, let's see how that works out for ya, sunshine.  Before you know it, no one's gonna want to associate with you anymore, let alone be your friend, and then you're really gonna be in big trouble, because let me tell ya, we're social animals and we're afraid of snakes.  Like Indiana Jones level afraid of snakes!  And I know where the snakes are, Buster!  You'd better believe I know where they are!  I've seen them, and I've battled them, and now I control the snakes!  The snakes obey my will, and I can force them to carry you away to the underworld, bucko!  So why don't you get that gun out of my face before I get really aggravated?  And why don't you run along to your mommy's basement and post Pepe memes before I tell the KGB how dirty your room is and they haul you off to the gulag?  That's what I thought.  Jordan Peterson, I've been following your work for a very long time, and I was wondering if you had any insights on things like the Gulag, or snakes, or the importance of keeping one's room clean?  Not really, no.  It's like if you enjoyed this bloody video, you should subscribe and like and leave a comment, man.  And if you want more of these videos to be made, you'd bloody well better donate on Subscribestar, man.  Unless you want to end up with a dirty room and get us all sent off to the gulag. ",
