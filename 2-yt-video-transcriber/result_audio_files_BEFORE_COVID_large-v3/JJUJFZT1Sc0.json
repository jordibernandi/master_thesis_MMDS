            "text": "Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthfication Chronicles and I was on the board tonight and look what I found.  The POTUS schedule, which is a Twitter account, it's not official, notice there's no blue checkmark or anything, but they just keep track of where POTUS is and they, you know, give his entire schedule a lot of times.  I mean, this is public information, so it's not like they're giving away anything.  but yeah this is what they had.  this was the last post that they made and all it is is the capital here and you've got the beast and it says capital the beast waiting on the way back.  And in my opinion, this one, let me get that, bring that up, that looks like they're inside the car.  So, you know, is this someone who is part of the entourage?  I don't think this is from the Beast itself, but it looks like it's right in there with the whole caravan thing.  So I don't know, that's the last thing they posted.  And then when you go to their account, It was suspended, so see, I put it up here at the top, and watch what happens when you click on it.  This is what you get, account suspended.  Why would they have suspended that account?  Serious, that account never says anything bad about anybody.  All it does is it gives Trump's schedule, and it posts little pictures like that, and once in a while, it gives like a little thought, but nothing is controversial in what they do, and they clearly said that they're not an official account.  so i don't understand why they suspended it.  that is just crazy.  anyway i wanted to share that with you.  and then this real quick.  i have not seen the video yet about the helicopters and whatever went on.  i really have not been aware of that.  i heard a periphery about it and somebody mentioned something in the comments and wanted to know my opinion.  well my opinion at this point is i don't know enough about it to have an opinion but i did find this and i'll put the link down below so you can look at it.  it's a lot of helicopter and military type speak So I don't totally understand what it's saying because I haven't seen the video.  I need to see the video before I can really collect this.  There have been some indications that it has to do with a lawyer for that Nexim cult.  And so it very well could be that.  I don't know for sure.  I will put this down below.  If you know anything about planes and things like that or military, that may make a lot more sense to you.  And if you have the video that they're referring to, could you please post it?  Because I've not seen it.  I did a short search for it.  I didn't find it, but I'm really tired tonight.  And so I'm headed off to bed as soon as I get this done and uploading.  And hopefully it won't take very long.  so we have a suspended account and for i don't know that was their post.  i can't imagine suspending them for that.  that's kind of weird because again this is public knowledge.  this is not putting out anything that is unusual or anything that shouldn't be there.  That's a pretty mundane account out of all the accounts.  So I don't know why they would have suspended this account.  It's really sad because I used to go there a lot to find out what was going on and where POTUS was.  So I don't know what's the deal.  This Anon says, POTUS schedules last pictures before suspension.  Wonder if they were the ones who leaked the schedule.  I don't know.  Whatever's going on.  Twitter is getting weird.  And the whole thing about the helicopter, I don't know.  I would really like to find out about it.  I'm going to have to do more research on it.  But sounds like something went down.  And according to this guy right here, it was not something that is typical.  So in his opinion, and he was actively involved with military helicopters.  So what happened?  I don't know.  I'm going to keep looking on it and see if I can find out what's going on and let you know.  So that's it for tonight.  I want to thank you for stopping by and I'll see y'all later. ",
