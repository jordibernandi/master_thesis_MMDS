            "text": "Hello friends.  So I've been asked how many foreigners are there in the triads?  Can foreigners join?  And by foreigners we're talking white guys, girls and other races, right?  So the short answer to that is none.  But there's kind of some exceptions and I'll try and explain.  Now, myself, I was never a triad.  All I was was a nightclub doorman for them.  So I was loosely what you might call an affiliate.  In America, back in the 80s, I think that's the era we're talking, there was a guy called John Willis who was a nightclub doorman.  And he broke up a fight or he stuck up for a Chinese guy one night.  And the Chinese guy happened to be a high level triad.  And he gave John a card and said, if you ever need me, come and look me up.  So John found himself out of work one day and stuck between a rock and a hard place.  He called this guy and the guy took him in.  The house that he lived in was frequented by a triad gang in, I think this is Boston we're talking about.  And the rumor is that he was taken into this gang, so went through the initiation ceremony, etc.  Well, that may well be.  I mean, there's always exceptions to kind of rules, right?  And this was in America.  In Hong Kong, it's a pure-blooded society.  They don't even trust people that have been overseas.  They're certainly not going to take a Westerner on their books.  I mean, these people have got people to answer to, right?  So, but what I did... No, the first thing I say there is they will work with anyone though.  If the triad think they can make money, whether it's through drugs, prostitution, gambling, crime, corruption, fraud, you know, this kind of thing in big business and any way they think they can make money, they will work with anyone because that's what they are.  They're a brotherhood, they're a fraternity, but they're also a crime syndicate, right?  So that said, what I came across in Hong Kong, I'll tell you the story.  I was on the door one night.  It was after the incident where the tie girl collapsed on the floor and she was unconscious and I kind of went in to help her.  If you've seen Sean Atwood's podcast, you've probably heard me talk about this.  I talk about it in my video.  What's it like to work for the triads?  and the night after I helped that girl or a few nights later I turned up for work and there was a South African guy there called Drick and he'd kind of been sent to keep a bit of an eye on me because I think they were quite suspicious because I was asking so many questions because I was fascinated.  I think they thought that maybe I was undercover police or something.  now What happened was this guy, Drick, had been homeless with a drink problem, and he said the triads rescued him one day.  They gave him a place to stay.  They asked him, they gave him a job in one of their clubs.  So, yeah, they'd kind of seen an opportunity to get a Westerner to come and work for them.  And they need Westerners because Chinese, they don't want to interact directly with Westerners because our culture and our psychology is so different.  So they need that person in the middle.  It's not like it's like me.  They're not massively going to trust you.  But they kind of, they've got you there as like a buffer, right?  So this guy Drip told me a story that he'd been homeless, sleeping on the street.  They'd come, they'd offered him a job.  They'd got him accommodation and in return, like he had to sort his life out a bit and work in their clubs.  And he was a cagey guy and he kept saying to me, have you got it yet, Chris?  I'd be like, what are you on about?  No, nothing.  fucker.  and then you know next like Chris so have you got it yet dude got what.  nothing you know got really annoying in the end.  and then one day I noticed when he was stood on the door of the club that when it when expats would approach so foreigners living in Hong Kong he'd go, he'd just let out this tiny indistinct cough and the person coming into the club would just cough back.  And it was so discreet that it took me ages to notice this thing that's going on.  When I looked down at the hands of the foreigners, you've got to remember, I was fascinated with the triads.  So I'm thinking if there's some secret cough code going on, are they doing like the hand signs as well?  And lo and behold, every time these expats would come, they'd make this sign.  it's referred to as Sik Yin which means smoke cigarette and Yak Gun Ho Lok means one can of coke or a can of coke.  so Sik Yin Yak Gun Ho Lok.  and it was just so clever And it bugged me for years that these guys kept trying to say, Chris, have you got it yet?  Can you see what's going on?  My friend was rescued, old Ron in my book.  He was rescued off the street.  Next thing I knew, he had a job.  He was going out with bar girls.  He had a flashy laptop.  He had an expensive apartment.  And he would do this thing when we're walking down the street.  couple of Chinese would walk past and he'd go, and they'd go, like, not as blatantly as I'm doing it now, right?  It was so subtle.  And I just cornered him one day and said, Ron, what the fuck is going on, man?  Oh, nothing.  I said, don't bullshit me.  Look at me.  I was out of my mind by this time, I was really unwell on the drugs, and I was desperately just trying to make sense of what the hell is going on in Hong Kong, in Wan Chai, and I said, Ron, don't just tell me, we didn't just walk past those two geezers, and you coughed, and they coughed back at you, and he went, I said, Ron, look, just throw me a bone, mate, please.  Throw me a bone.  Can't you see I'm desperate?  And he said, I said, all right, Ron, just tell me this.  Should I be, you know, should I be doing that?  And he's like, well, at least they'll see you're trying.  That's the God's honest truth.  That's not my psychosis talking.  That is what he said to me, right?  So, fast forward, years later, I'm still, I'm writing my book and I'm trying to get my head around.  what were all these foreigners doing?  They came in my club.  A lot of them, they had no jobs in Hong Kong and Hong Kong's a really expensive place.  I knew that they were selling drugs and I knew that they were selling the drugs in the Chinese clubs, right?  Remember, the Chinese will work, the triads will work with anyone if they can make a buck, right?  So I'm doing some research for my book and I just typed into Google the foreign triad.  And lo and behold, up comes an article called My Big Fat Triad Wedding.  It was written by, I think it's Asia Online, which is an Asian newspaper.  And it was written by a guy called Bill Sparrow, William Sparrow.  And it was about a Westerner who'd gone into a Hong Kong nightclub in Wan Chai.  So probably we're talking the one I worked in.  And he got talking to a Filipino bar girl, right?  And he notices she's got a tattoo on her wrist.  And he says to her, I'll post the link guys for this.  I'll post the link for this.  You can read it yourselves, right?  He said, what's the tattoo?  And she said, oh, nothing, nothing.  He said, no, come on, what's the tattoo?  She said, ah, it's the foreign triad.  He's like, what?  She said, the foreign triad.  When I was younger, I was in the foreign triad.  It's this clique of Westerners that they, you know, foreigners that run errands for the 14K.  That was the gang I worked for.  He's like, what do you mean errands?  She's like drug running, smuggling jewels, prostitution, you know, getting girls to pimp out, this kind of thing.  So I was gobsmacked.  I'd lived with that knowledge for like 15 years.  I couldn't find anything on the Internet until I came across this article.  And it all came flooding back what happened in that club.  And to think that I was right about the foreign trial because I was so unwell.  It was really unclear about a lot of things, right?  If you've read Eat and Smoke, you'll know what I mean.  And so, yeah.  Now, fast forward.  When I went back to Hong Kong for my book launch, it was a very proud moment for me, actually.  I walked through Heathrow Airport and I'd gone from being chronically mentally unwell in psychosis from crystal meth addiction lost everything right almost everything to walking through Heathrow and my book was like number 12 bestseller and I did all that myself.  I had no help no support groups no AA nothing like that no doctors.  anyway I digress.  When I got back to Hong Kong, I went back to that club.  I tell you what, it was quite a nerve-wracking moment for me.  I wasn't quite sure how it would go down, right?  I kind of figured everything would have changed, but then I saw a YouTube video with the owner.  If you heard my Sean Atwood podcast, you'll know the owner was called David.  not a triad.  I saw a video with him on, right?  So I'm going back to this club, realizing he still owns it.  And I didn't know if the Dilo, that's the triad big brother, still managed the place, the guy that I knew, Paul Eng.  Yeah, it was quite a moment to go back in that club, right?  And I just went straight in, passed the guy on the door.  Anyway, I met a couple of guys, old China hands they're called, that's expats that have lived in Asia all their lives.  And I was pressing them saying, look, can you tell me about the foreign tribe?  And none of the people I spoke to would let anything slip.  I took it that they just genuinely didn't know.  But then again, you've got to remember, I worked for the triads.  These guys probably never worked for them.  I don't know if that is a factor.  But I spoke to a Filipino bar girl and I said, do you know the foreign triad?  She's like, no idea, you know.  So it's quite bizarre.  I don't know if this was just a thing in the 90s.  I don't I don't know.  Yeah, I just don't know.  It's kind of the beauty of my book if you've read it because it's kind of up in arms.  So the answer to this story is no, no white triads, foreign triads.  There's people that are close, the people that work in the clubs like I did.  I was never that close, but there are some Indian guys that have been in Hong Kong like 20 years.  They know all these guys like the back of their hand, you know.  And there was the John Willis character I told you about.  So next question, please.  Thank you. ",
