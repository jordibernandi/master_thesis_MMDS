            "text": "Chris Silliza at CNN points out the chaos of just the past five days, just the past five days.  Chaos has been the defining word of the Trump presidency from the fucker's inauguration speech, total chaos.  And Salazar writes, that's why it's hard to say that things are ever somehow more chaotic than the day before.  Because what's more chaotic than utter chaos, right?  Then he answers his own question.  He says the answer to that is the last five days.  Because in these last five days, we've seen an avalanche of news quotes and just general Trump-related content everywhere.  that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.  Consider what we've seen just since Friday, and this is Tuesday.  Two Trump rallies, one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky, filled with the now familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become Trump's calling card.  Second, A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes, setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown.  Third, E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her, raped her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him.  Four, the Department of Justice threatens legal action against the publishers of a not yet released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House.  That's the book Warning.  They threaten against, I mean, goddamn, a threat against something that hasn't even been fucking published yet.  This is where we live.  This is where we're going.  Why can't we put millions of people in the streets to stop this while we still can?  Calm down, Mike.  Number five.  House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy.  Number six, Roger Stone's trial into his attempts to gain information about Russia hacking efforts opens.  Number seven, newly released documents from former special counsel.  Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's deleted emails.  And in that same frame, Friday night at 5 p.m.  through this morning at 10 a.m.  Eastern.  Trump had tweeted 68 times.  In addition to dozens of other retweets, he also held three press availabilities, one each on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.  The rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday are staggering.  Even for people who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting.  But chaos is the point.  That's what Trump has always dealt in, chaos.  He's not a leader.  He's a destroyer.  He's not a kind man.  He's a fucking beast.  He's not a smart man.  He's one of the most ignorant savages ever to be in the office of the presidency.  He's not a benevolent man.  He is a malevolent man.  Trump knows, Chris writes, that the media and people more generally can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day, or week.  And so the more he throws shit up against the wall, the harder it is for anyone to hone in on any of the stories, like impeachment, that are less favorable to him on a day-to-day basis.  You can't look in ten places at once.  Now, Trump, of course, doesn't control when House Democrats release transcripts or when federal courts rule on things like his fucked up tax returns.  But anyway, the more people tune out and just say, like every day, you know, I tell Kathy, why the fuck am I doing this again today?  you start to get to the point where it's just overwhelming and you just want to tune out.  I keep thinking of my good friend Bob Alexander who finally reached the point where he said, you know what?  Fuck this!  I'm leaving!  And he left.  And he left before Trump.  And moved to Canada.  And he's now a Canadian citizen.  Anyway, the more people tune out and decide that what they see coming in this avalanche of shit from Trump's Washington, the more they just describe it to, oh, it's just the same old, same old stuff.  You know, I'm starting to hear that here in the South, too.  Well, they're all like that.  Oh, what's the big fucking deal, you know?  So I made a phone call to the president of Ukraine.  So what?  They're all a bunch of liars.  Jesus Christ.  That works for Trump.  That's exactly what he wants.  His behavior is actually deeply abnormal.  He is a sociopath.  Yeah, I think you get that.  The pox on both houses mentality that a lot of people are starting to feel helps him immeasurably because it avoids casting his actions, what he does, and his words, what he says, for what they are.  Totally ahistoric.  There's nothing like this in the past in this country.  There is in Germany, in Italy, in Spain, in Japan, in some South American countries, Central American, Middle Eastern countries, but up to this point, up until this raunchy, rancid son of a bitch was spewed up on the stage in this country, we managed to, for the most part, escape that.  Not anymore.  not anymore.  solicit puts this out there too.  from a fact-checking standpoint Trump again benefits from the sheer volume of this shit and the contents he creates.  reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday in Kentucky last night Chris writes, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both A, the truth, and B, even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for the office.  But by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower.  while the White House senior counselor, the filthy, degenerate Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of alternative facts.  And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out, and the tax returns thing happened.  Even for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all these stories the attention they desperately need and deserve.  We have a gangster, a criminal, a killer running the country.  Chris writes, and if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, What must it feel like to the average news consumer?  I'll tell you what it feels like.  Like madness, like insanity, like nervous breakdown, like overload.  Drinking from a fire hose doesn't come even close.  Yeah, that's the truth.  And then he closes with this.  He writes, now consider this.  We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election.  and 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa.  In short, if you think this has been bad, just wait.  The real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up, because it won't, but what the political and psychological impact of this unending chaos will be.  Do voters tune it out?  Do they dial in even more?  And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant avalanche and cavalcade of bullshit and lies and assaults and attacks?  Trump, I don't know where this miserable fucker came from, but he comes from something that is sick and twisted in the American psyche.  You want a good example of that?  Take a look at these little shits who work at the Fox sewer, starting with Hannity.  And who's the one, the business side, who is that?  Lou Dobbs, if ever there were two more ridiculous, sickening figures in media than Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity, I mean, these two together have even eclipsed Limbaugh.  Of course, Limbaugh's shelf life expired years ago, but that fucker is still on the air, still hauling water for American fascism.  But I think Limbaugh is too fat and too old, and he's been repeating the same shit for 35 years.  So along comes this little prick Hannity and Lou Dobbs.  Not that they're new to the scene.  Hannity's been in broadcast for 25 years.  Dobbs has been fucking around first at CNN, then at Fox for another 25 or 30 years.  But what happened to the head of the Institute of Advanced Conservative Studies?  What happened to Limbaugh?  You have a whole new class of lying deceiving, filthy Christians, rotten, Christ-killing Christians.  Hannity claims to be a Catholic.  That figures.  Lou Dobbs, I have no fucking idea, but I know he's a Christian.  What?  Lou Dobbs is Catholic too.  Oh, that's right.  Where's his wife from?  Yeah, I think she converted him from... I don't know.  If we don't put millions of people in the streets, if we don't do that, I don't see any hope at all, any salvation, any turning.  Do you?  You think things are still malleable enough, pliable enough, democratic enough?  that we can all just troop to the polls and elect a new Senate, a new House, and a new president, and then get about the business of saving life on this planet?  Do you think it's just a matter of flow?  Yeah.  Without millions of people in the streets demanding an end to this madness?  I don't see it any other way. ",
