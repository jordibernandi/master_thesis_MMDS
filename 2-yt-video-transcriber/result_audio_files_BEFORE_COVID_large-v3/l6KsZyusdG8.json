This operation is going to cost at least a half a billion dollars.  So I've repeatedly written to the Department of Defense asking whether the deployment impacts military readiness.  Each time the answer has been no.  General Neller, last month you wrote a memo to the Navy Secretary identifying nine factors, and I'll quote, imposing unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and  solvency.\".  One was the border deployment, and a second was the President's plan to take funding away from military construction for a border wall.  Now, General Neller, I know you did not expect this memo to become public.  You did not release it.  You were just doing your job by assessing risks.  Ranking Member Reid and I, along with several other committee members, sent another letter to the department yesterday because that's our job as members of this committee to ask questions about the impact of these risks.  So let me ask, have any exercises been canceled or were any units sent to the border instead of going to schedule training exercises?  Just factual questions, General. ",

You're correct, I had a list of eight unresourced requirements of which one was the mission to go to the border.  And what I tried to articulate was if we did not get funding for these, the total cost of these, about $300 million, of which the border mission right now to date costs in about 6.2, if we didn't get additional money, then we would have to look at other sources for money, which could potentially include other exercises, which would eventually affect the readiness of the force.

Other units, one particular unit is doing a mission today.  that's not part of their core competency, so for 60 days they can handle that, but it will affect their readiness. ",

There are some that actually benefit from the deployment because they can actually do their job that their core competency is, some not.  But let's bring it up.  And the whole reason that I ask both the CNO and the Commandant for memos such as this is I feel I have to know, being the chief executive of the service, to know where the stresses are.  This was item G on the whole list.  The main stress that we were dealing with at the time, Senator, was the hurricane, which was imposing the greatest cost on the Marine Corps.  500 men for a month at the southern border is $1.25 million.  In my mind, is that affecting my readiness stress?  No, it's not. ",

You're doing your job when you raise those concerns.  We're doing our job when we ask about them.  The Commandant of the Marine Corps has said that border deployment and the transfer of military construction funds for a wall contribute to an unacceptable risk to the Marine Corps' combat readiness and solvency.  I think it's time for the President and Congress to listen to him, and we should keep asking these questions.  Thank you.  Thank you both. ",
