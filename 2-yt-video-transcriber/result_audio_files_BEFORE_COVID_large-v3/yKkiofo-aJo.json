            "text": "Shalom, chavirim!  We're here in the city of Jerusalem talking about the names of God.  One of my favorite names is Adonai Rof'i, which means, God is my healer.  Now, the word Rof'i comes from the word doctor in Hebrew, which is Rof'eh.  And as we call out on the name of the Lord in times of sickness and time of need, we can declare that powerful statement, God is my healer.  In Isaiah chapter 53, it says that Messiah took upon Him all of our pain and all of our affliction, and by His stripes we are healed.  So when my kids aren't feeling well or when my kids are sick, we lay our hands upon them and we pray and we declare, God is my healer.  As we go forth this week in any situation, you can declare and worship that God is a God that heals. ",
