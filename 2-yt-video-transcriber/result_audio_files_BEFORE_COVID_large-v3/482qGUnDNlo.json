He knows how many hairs are on your head.  He knows you by name.  He knows every thought of your heart.  And he says you've got a multitude of sins.  But because he's rich in mercy, he made a way for you to be forgiven.  2,000 years ago, God became a human being.  Jesus of Nazareth.  Perfect, sinless man who gave his life on the cross to take the punishment for the sin of the world.  It's as simple as this.  You and I broke God's law, the Ten Commandments, Jesus paid the fine in full.  Just before he died, he said, it is finished.  In other words, the debt has been paid.  If you're in court and someone pays the fine, the judge can legally let you go.  You can say, Leslie's guilty, but someone's paid a fine, let her go.  You can do that, which is just and right, because the fine was paid by another.  And God can be just and extend your mercy at the same time.  He can legally let you live forever even though you're guilty.  He can let you go because of what Jesus did on the cross through his death and resurrection.  What you have to do is repent and trust alone in him.  We can't earn everlasting life, but God can freely give it to us because he's rich in mercy and the lover of our soul.  Does that make sense? ",
