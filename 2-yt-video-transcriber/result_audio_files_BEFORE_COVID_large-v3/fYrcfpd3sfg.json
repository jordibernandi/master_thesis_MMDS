            "text": "Hey folks, it's Patriot Nurse.  Join me today.  We're going to discuss what we can expect out of the left during the next civil war.  So I saw an article recently, I'm sure y'all did too, in which essentially Seven out of ten people in the United States recognize that a civil war is coming.  I'm not happy about this and I'm not thrilled to be able to discuss this subject matter at this time, but I am a realist, as I'm sure a lot of y'all are, and I also believe in being prepared.  and being able to be equipped to handle different situations, and so that's what I want to discuss with you.  When we evaluate the way in which leftists and people who are pro-socialist, pro-essentially communist, and there is no differentiation because the two of them go together, so don't give me this nonsense about, oh, Bernie's so different because he's a democratic socialist.  Listen, it doesn't work that way.  We know that people who are aligned with this ideology will eventually turn to violence far, far, far faster than your average person who believes in conservative values and Bible-based values.  Because for the most part, people living their everyday lives who are Bible believers and who align with conservative ideology also align with turning the other cheek and nonviolence in general.  Definitely nonpreemptive violence.  So when we look at the left and we look at who their founding fathers are in contrast to the founding fathers of our republic here in the United States, the contrast could not be starker.  When we look at men like Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, Adams, these are men who, regardless of their particular background, inflection on the Word of God, or the way in which they viewed and interpreted the Word of God, they still essentially believed that the God of the Bible was God, and that there were laws to live by that were ensconced in the Bible.  And those laws, of course, sprang forth and helped us develop the laws which we have here in the United States.  When we look at the founding fathers of the left, we look at men like Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, and then, of course, their inheritors.  when you look at Stalin, and let's go right on down the list of ruthless dictators.  But the commonality is that these people, these leftists, these communists, these socialists, before they got into power, oh yeah, by the way, Hitler was another one of them, National Socialism, Nazi, National Socialism, all of these people utilized violence and terrorism in order to accomplish their great and glorious plans of bringing the world into a glorious socialist revolution.  One of the ways in which they did this was to utilize terrorism and especially bombings in order to do this.  And so the reason why I am focusing on this with you all and this recounting of history is that we know these people are very non-creative.  They recycle the same failed ideas, whether it's on television or whether it's in advocacy of public policy, and especially in the way in which they seek to accomplish their glorious socialist revolutions.  They will eventually turn to violence.  They have already done this, as we have seen with Antifa, but they haven't achieved the rate and speed of change which they desired, which is why they are attempting to overthrow the president, a duly elected official, via a secret hearing to establish impeachment articles right now.  I'm not a partisan politician, so I don't believe the Republicans are the party of God.  So this is not the lens through which I'm viewing this circumstance.  What we do know is that these people are rabid.  They are demonic.  They get their power from demonic entities.  And if you need any further proof of this, just look at the same positions which they espouse and see what they have in common.  Okay?  Universally, it's death.  it's destruction and it's theft.  the enemy comes to steal and kill and destroy.  okay.  so when i look at what they do and how they do it throughout history and even in this country in 1919 granted it was anarchist terrorism but they will use explosives in order to accomplish their reign of terror.  so what they do is they go to different places and they utilize violence and they utilize terrorism and they utilize the tactics and the technology of the day to most effectively do this to scare people to strike the sheep And then they'll scatter and then they'll go to whatever seems powerful and somewhat protective at the time, which of course brings in tyrannical and totalitarian governments.  So when we look at the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar and Maxine Waters, these people give, via the elected officials, these people give legitimacy to the violence that's being perpetuated by their underclass, by the underlings and by the grassroots organization of people like Antifa.  When I look in recent history, we had a fellow who was a devout and avowed leftist who brought explosives and attempted to attack the Tacoma Ice Center.  We also look at what happened when a member of the, I believe it was Portland Antifa, took a firearm to his daughter's school.  And he had, if I'm not mistaken, he had been stripped of his parental rights because he was such a loon and an unstable, unhinged individual from seeing his daughter.  So when he shows up at the school to try and, if I understand this, take her by force with a firearm, he is confronted and shot by a police officer.  The branch of Antifa to which he was aligned responded in Portland by planting explosives around the police station in Portland.  What we see time and time again, especially in recent history when we evaluate the 60s forward, is that these leftists and these socialists align not only politically with Islam and public and particularly radical Islam and their tactics, but they utilize the methodology of different groups who are radical Islamist terrorist groups around the world to attack.  accomplish their their means and so i anticipate that in the time forward we're going to see more and more improvised explosive devices more and more bombings more and more explosions and so we need to be prepared for this.  okay when you have documented historical proof of these different groups.  And this goes back, guys, I could go right on down the list with Bulgaria, with Vietnam, with Russia, with the Soviet republics, Chechnya, there's another one, that's a really good one, and all throughout South America, Central and South America, Rhodesia, South Africa, Like, need I go on?  These people have proven time and time again that they use terrorism in order to get their way when they feel that the political momentum has slowed and is no longer in their favor.  So we're right there at about the cusp of this.  And so I, at this point, I've been really praying for about two to three weeks because I haven't put a video up in a few weeks.  And I just haven't really had anything that really was pressing on my heart.  And it came to me last night.  That I want to encourage us to be prepared for this.  Because many of us who carry firearms and who advocate self-defense, we are prepared for and we have trained for the active shooter situation.  But I want to encourage us also to have our heads on a swivel and be prepared for the eventuality that these people are going to use explosives in order to accomplish their means.  I'm not advocating for violence.  I'm just telling you that as a student of history, and I'm sure there are many of you folks out there who are also students of history, that when you look at the ways in which these leftists accomplish their political objectives, especially when they feel that the political wins are not in their sails, they will use violence in order to frighten people into pushing them into an objective.  So I anticipate that they're going to try and do this at some point, and we need to be prepared and ready for it.  One of the ways in which you can be ready for this is clearly to carry your firearms, to be skilled in self-defense, but also to be skilled marksmen.  Another thing we can do is to carry first aid equipment, to carry blowout kits, etc.  A tourniquet is a great thing to carry, a purpose-built tourniquet.  I recommend either the soft tee wide or the cat tourniquet.  I'll put links in the description box below to those.  I recommend that you be familiar with being able to stop hemorrhagic bleeding, of course.  And then also be prepared with what it looks like when people are the victim of blast injuries.  There are many, many classes you can take.  PHTLS is actually a really good one, Pre-Hospital Traumatic Life Support, Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support.  You can go to nremt.org.  I'll put a link in the description box below and take their classes.  You do need to get the book ahead of time though.  Spend $100 on the book because you're gonna suck in class if you don't.  You need to know how to deal with blast injuries and the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary injuries that come from blast injuries.  Because I have news for you folks.  The health care... Services in this country are in rapid decline.  I saw a news article recently where more than half of nurses and doctors are burnout, and I can attest to that.  I can tell you that as a nurse, I have the feeling and the observation that the healthcare industry, which is what it is, has abandoned and left me as a nurse.  It has valued technology and the implementation of technology and the electronic medical records and tech and gear far more than it has.  patient care and certainly supporting nurses as the front line.  patient care givers.  When I look at what has happened, I see a very, very overtaxed healthcare industry on the verge of collapse in this country, primarily because of the implementation of Obamacare.  We had problems beforehand, but when you subsidize something, you get more of it.  So if you subsidize sickness and you encourage people to get sick, then you're going to get more sickness and you got more people coming in with less money and less care providers.  So you can't expect this healthcare industry and this system to be in ship shape and Bristol fashion.  when these leftists strike and try and accomplish their means.  But you start to see how these people, how the mind works.  They consider that our representative constitutional republic doesn't work anymore.  And they believe that the way in which they're going to accomplish their great socialist revolution for the wealth redistribution and the evolution of mankind, the way they're going to do this is with violence.  And why is that?  Because look at who the father is in that ideology.  Their father in that ideology is satan.  he comes to steal to kill and to destroy and that's everything that they want to do.  they want to steal other people's wealth and distribute it.  they want to kill people who don't align with them and they want to destroy everything good and everything wholesome and everything conservative and everything that has been proven throughout time to perpetuate greatness in the civilization.  they want to destroy it.  So be prepared for them and for their antics.  We need to be prepared to defend ourselves.  We need to be gathering together with like-minded people.  Because the war that we are going to be facing is not solely in the physical realm.  We are going to be battling people who have their power and have their strength and have their momentum from a very dark, wicked, vile part of this universe.  And the weapons of our warfare are not merely physical.  I hope that was helpful for you all today.  That's what I had on my heart.  I'm not going to make a video, guys, just to put more stuff out there.  That's not how I roll.  And if I have something to say, I'm going to say it to you.  And if I don't have anything to say, I'm not just going to make a video for the sake of making a video.  I'm past that.  We are past that.  And we don't need more noise anymore.  We don't need more noise.  We don't need more news articles that just reinforce helplessness.  We need to be prepared.  We need to be acting on it.
