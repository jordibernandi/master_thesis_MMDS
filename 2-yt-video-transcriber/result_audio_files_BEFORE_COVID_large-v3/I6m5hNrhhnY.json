            "text": "There is a movie that Netflix put out, 2016, I believe.  It's called Barry.  It's about Barack Obama.  Went by the name Barry when he was at Columbia.  And in that movie was something quite insightful for a Hollywood movie of some type.  It was Obama, the actor portraying him, debating some Hebrew Israelites in Harlem.  And so that showed a few things.  It showed there's an increasing awareness of Jews.  Hebrew Israelites in major cities throughout pop culture.  I think you're going to see it more and more movies.  In fact, there's another movie with Woody Harrelson and there's Hebrew Israelites out there.  There's a movie coming out that actually partially lampoons Hebrew Israelites.  So that was one thing.  So it relates to the growth, their increasing visibility in urban areas.  And also it made for a great title of book because in jest, I said, look, one of the earliest books, apologist against the hebrews lights apparently was young barack obama.  but really i use that scene simply as a window to go into a mysterious subject for a lot of people.  so i talk about that scene and i use it simply as a platform to discuss the larger issue.  really the book's not about obama and it is about the hebrews lights and i only use black hebrews lights and the title.  they don't like being called that they used to call themselves that but now they just like hebrew Hebrews or Israelites only, and I just call them the Hebrew Israelites.  All right. ",
