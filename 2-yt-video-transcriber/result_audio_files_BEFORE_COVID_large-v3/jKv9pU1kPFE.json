            "text": "So, listen.  This is why they consider Tulsi Gabbard to be a danger to the establishment.  This is why they consider her to be a danger to the military industrial complex.  This is why they consider her to be a danger to their checkbooks.  Because she tells the truth.  Right.  She she got wind.  This is part of the reason why she went to Syria.  Right.  She got wind.  that we may be directly or indirectly funding terrorist groups.  And these rebel groups may be allied with the very people that we were told.  And she was taught and we are conditioned in the military to believe are our enemies.  So she went to visit and figure out that was the truth.  And in her encounters, she also visited Assad because she was invited.  She found out that it was true.  We were funding these groups.  Now, what she reports is true.  There are numerous stories where this is discussed, right?  But we don't have to look at the stories.  WikiLeaks told us the truth already.  Hillary Clinton told us the truth via her emails when she talked about the fact that we give money to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar, to Yemen, excuse me, not Yemen, to Turkey.  in other governments that she admits in the email knowingly funds terrorism, despite the fact that on the Department of Justice's website, they'd have you believe that Iran is the biggest financier of Middle Eastern terrorism, which is not true at all, actually, not even close.  It is Saudi Arabia, if you only want a small example.  How about we look at where Osama bin Laden came from?  Osama bin Laden was a member or is or was.  I don't know.  We don't know if he's still alive anymore.  Whatever.  Let's just say for the sake of the argument, he's dead.  So Osama bin Laden is of the royal family.  OK.  Osama bin Laden is Saudi Arabian.  Osama bin Laden was formerly a CIA asset.  This is something you can look up easily.  This is one of the most basic things that we're taught in the military.  But he was indeed a CIA asset.  Now, knowing that Osama bin Laden was CIA, knowing that he was of the Saudi Arabian family, why weren't we invading Saudi Arabia?  Why aren't we constantly pressing the royal family?  Why aren't we constantly pressing the elites of Saudi Arabia who might have been involved in housing him?  Now, this, once again, isn't speculation that they might have been involved because right now, as we speak, there is a federal court case against elite Saudi royalty in Florida, of all places.  What a surprise.  It is currently being presided over by Judge Zopp, the same judge that is currently presiding over or was presiding over the DNC fraud lawsuit, who may actually be retrying the case if we get through the federal appeals process, which is looking like we might get through the federal appeals process.  So The Saudi Arabians are in some way very connected to this whole thing, but we didn't go and invade their country.  Yet we went in Afghanistan for Al Qaeda and ended up killing most, not most of the people, but hundreds of thousands of people.  Right?  So then fast forward, a Columbia, our study from Columbia university had found that we actually directly took part in creating ISIS.  This is news that has been available.  Now, for Jake Tapper to say, oh, well, they would dispute that.  And they said, they vet them really well before we give them money.  They vet these rebel groups.  We vet them.  We vet them.  We vet them.  Once again.  We supposedly vetted rebel groups before we trained them in Iraq.  They turned into ISIS.  We vetted Al-Qaeda before they became Al-Qaeda.  What a surprise.  We vetted Saddam and his army.  When we wanted to use him to fight against Iran, and then he turned on us because we defended Saudi Arabia and Qatar against Iraq from oil money, basically.  In Kuwait, excuse me, not Kuwait, not Qatar, it was Kuwait.  So, what does that mean?  This is the same CIA that lost trillions upon trillions upon trillions of dollars.  Have you ever thought, I mean, yeah, some of it's probably going into somebody's pocket, let's be honest.  But also, let's keep it real.  Where do you think a lot of that missing money is going?  Why do you think they don't want it to be tracked?  Because it's going to rebel groups.  Now, in Syria specifically, We can even discuss the fact that, remember when the missiles that literally everybody was against, except for the military industrial complex establishment that is the Democratic and Republican parties and mainstream media, everybody was against those attacks because we said there was absolutely no proof.  The United Nations found no proof.  Hell, even, excuse me, Rand Paul said that there was no proof of chemical attacks.  Later on, we found out Mad Dog Madness concurred with that.  There had been no proof found of chemical attacks, although he said he wanted to find some.  And yet we launched missiles anyway, alongside several Western European nations.  You know what happened very shortly after that?  ISIS ended up invading Damascus.  Like a coordinated attack.  It was minutes, not even an hour.  Like they were already mobilized and ready to move on a planned operation right after the military strikes.  Interesting, right?  Almost like they were being guided to pretend that we have some type of control over the rebel groups.  The same rebel groups who will betray us because they know very well how we betray other groups in the Middle East at our behest and our convenience.  I mean, these are for you and I, these are simple connections, simple patterns.  Doesn't seem really debatable.  But these are patterns that many of the American people have not been exposed to because it's never really been discussed on mainstream.  It's never been discussed, especially by a presidential candidate.  And it's never been discussed by a presidential candidate who was once a part of the political establishment that she is now trying to take down from both sides.  So now you start to get an even deeper look into why they consider her to be so dangerous.  Understand something.  There are people that would have you believe that Tulsi Gabbard is, is, uh, not progressive, right?  There's that side of the fence.  Oh, she's not really progressive.  Um, I would have to say that at this point, if Tulsi Gabbard put an R by her name, I'll probably have to, I live in Florida, so it's a closed primary, but I would probably have to register as a Republican to vote for her right now.  If you ask me right now, why?  Because there are some intangible qualities.  That supersede labels.  There's some intangible that they transcend party politics.  You've heard me time and time again discuss how ably I'm against the military industrial complex because I've seen what it does.  I know who it targets and I know a lot of the people it targets looks a lot like me.  They look a lot like you and I. People of color, marginalized people.  That's on my video about Yanomar.  I discuss how the military industrial complex, for some reason, almost exclusively targets people of color.  Very rarely does it target the countries where white people dominate.  They say that socialism is so bad, we have to destroy socialism.  We have to destroy socialism.  We don't invade Germany.  We don't invade France.  We don't invade Spain.  France is one of the least socialist countries, but we don't invade Switzerland.  We don't invade the Netherlands.  We don't invade Norway.  We don't invade Sweden.  We don't invade basically any socialist nation or socialist capitalist nation in Western Europe.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  We don't use chemical weapons on white dominated military either.  We don't treat white dominated countries with the disdain, with the xenophobia as a government, as we do countries that are dominated by people of color.  These are the facts.  Tulsi Gabbard being a military veteran saying these facts becomes an immediate threat because now these facts start to hold water.  Being a presidential candidate saying these facts, now they start to hold even more water.  Then when you consider the fact that she was accepted by them, it's like y'all loved her and the moment that she decided to tell the truth.  Y'all despise her.  You attack her.  You belittle her.  You denigrate her.  All of a sudden, she isn't a factor, but she was a promised one because she didn't only speak.  She introduced Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic National Convention, yes, but she also spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention because they were trying to prop her up, which is why subsequently she became the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.  So you believe to her then.  So if you care about our government, if Al Qaeda is really the enemy, if ISIS is really the enemy, shouldn't we be taking a step back and saying, wow, maybe we should do a better job vetting.  Maybe we should be.  if we're really concerned about national security, maybe we should take a deeper look into this.  No, they don't want that.  Because if you take a deeper look, you'll find out not only did they vet them, they knew that.  who those rebel groups would be working with.  But as long as y'all create controversy, as long as you destabilize, then you will get our support.  Look at what happened in Libya.  We paid rebel groups from Chad.  We made it seem like that Libya was punished, Qaddafi was killing his own people, which wasn't true.  The Africans, African Union, Libya, they love Gaddafi, actually, believe it or not.  They consider him a staple as far as protecting Africa and the AU from Western imperialism and colonialism.  We had propped up a leader in Chad who was a right-wing authoritarian.  We paid rebel groups in Chad, which is a country that neighbors Libya.  To cause controversy there.  Then that was our excuse to be there, saying that Gaddafi was trying to destroy the government in Chad and the rebels in Chad that bordered Libya.  And look what happened with those rebels that we paid.  They started engaging in slave trade.  You notice we don't talk about Libya anymore, though.  The stories always end up the same, and yet we wanna question Tulsi Gabbard on the legitimacy of her facts, of these truths that she is telling the American people so they can finally wake up.  But these truths are much more, they're much more impactful and effective than you may think because, well, she was just in Iowa.  She filled a gym.  I mean, She filled, she, I was in, I was part of Bernie Sanders, the Bernie Sanders campaign when they were saying that he had a 2% chance of winning the primary election.  And it was like a 3% margin of error.  Okay.  Which means he has zero chance.  That's what they were basically predicting.  Mind you, Tulsi Gabbard right now in the earliest stages of her campaign, just announced two weeks ago, is pulling more people before the debates.  right now than Bernie did.  She has more support and popularity than Bernie did right now with a four or five month head start that Bernie did not have.  Keep thinking she's going to be a non-factor.  But for you all who do support her, these are the truths that we have to continue to tell.  These are the clips we have to continue to show people.  They try to say, oh, she's not really progressive.  She didn't really evolve.  How convenient.  Her evolution was not convenient at all.  It almost cost her everything.  The same decision that Bernie Sanders was faced with.  The reason that y'all love Bernie Sanders, he played ball at the end of the day.  I understand why he did it.  I don't hate him for it.  I don't despise him for it.  I still think the guy is top two as far as the best candidates to run this country.  Now, if you want to ask me honestly, who's the best candidate to help run the free world and free it from the shackles of colonialism and imperialism, I'm probably going to go with Tulsi in that regard.  Because to free the rest of the world from these shackles of imperialism and colonialism, you have to be willing to take the hits from the establishment and not worry about the direction of your career.  You can't worry about your personal legacy at that point.  You have to be willing to be apologetic when it is necessary and be genuine about it.  You have to be willing to admit when you were wrong.  You have to be willing to stand up to the establishment when they claim Russiagate was the end all be all, was that?  was it.  And we just found out from NBC today that that was nonsense.  There's no collusion.  We just found that out.  But you have to be willing to stand up to that type of stuff.  Tulsi was.  You have to be willing to say Assad is not an adversary or an enemy.  He has never attacked us.  He has never sought to cause controversy in the United States.  You have to be willing to use facts and truth to combat xenophobia, establishment smears, and lies.  Tulsi has been willing to do that, even if it meant putting her career on the line.  So, once again, now you know why they're so scared of Tulsi Gabbard.  This is just another example.  Keep hitting them where it hurts. ",
