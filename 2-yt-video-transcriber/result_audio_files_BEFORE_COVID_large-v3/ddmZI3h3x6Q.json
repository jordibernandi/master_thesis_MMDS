Where fossil fuel companies receive subsidies while the sun shines free.  Where individual citizens are blamed for problems caused by large companies.  Where schoolchildren have to fight because their future is at stake.  The climate, we can't wait!  Thank you.  We do have solutions already.  They require reparations and redistribution at an unprecedented scale and a complete transformation of our economic and political system.  Hey, Patsy, somebody right there.  Thank you. ",
