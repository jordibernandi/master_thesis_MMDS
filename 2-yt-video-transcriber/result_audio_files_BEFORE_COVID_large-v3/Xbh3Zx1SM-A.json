Like, that would not be, at the very least, okay, better than what we have.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, what are you so perplexed about, Chris?  Like... He keeps going back to.  why should you run?  Like, why shouldn't?  he would be my question.  And also, let's not act like, you know, having some sort of background in politics is something that, like, you know, is a prerequisite to, you know, holding some sort of, you know, a high chain of command.  Do you see who is in?  When you was having six hours of empty podium for Donald Trump, you wasn't saying that.  You know what I mean?  Like, where was all that then?  You know, like, whoa, what?  Why would you do this?  Why do you think this?  It's like, what are you talking about, dude?  This is like the third time he's asked, why you?

So the media has constantly smeared people like Tim Pool, Joe Rogan, Jimmy Dore as being far-right extremists or alt-right or some sort of something like that.  So they just blanket that, and because he was on the Joe Rogan podcast, he then got a huge bump from 4chan again.  And so on and so forth.  Yes, there are pockets of bad people in every single facet of every single platform.  There is horrible Antifa members that watch your show, Chris.  Doesn't make you a member of Antifa and you shouldn't have to come out and constantly denounce that.  You're not responsible for the people who are your fans to the largest extent anyway, right?  So for him to even phrase this question, it's such misinformation.  It's such a blatant lie.  He does not have a large following of KKK members.  What are you even talking about?  What he means is he's talked to people like Sam Harris, people like Joe Rogan that the mainstream media establishment has called \u2013 the intellectual dark web.  And that's what he means.  So when he appears on a Sam Harris podcast, who was originally one of the Four Horsemen with Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, and the other guy.  So that's crazy.  So because he goes on one or multiples of these shows, all of a sudden he's a racist because they've made that false equivalency and touted that false narrative against those people who are getting way more traction than the mainstream media.  That's what's happening here.  And the same was a similar situation with the other interviewer that I didn't have any audio with, that I didn't really talk through like this.  So there's a lot of this in here.  And if you guys like me breaking down stuff like this, this long-form content, smack a like and comment down below.  Let me know what you think about this.  Andrew Yang destroyed him, man.  He just destroyed him.  And he did it subtly.  He didn't do it abrasively.  And he's classy, man.  He keeps it classy.  And that's what we like about it.  So anyways, don't forget to like and subscribe.  I appreciate you guys.  I'll have more stuff coming out.  Especially because I think Andrew Yang is getting ready to explode here soon.  And I should have that video up by tomorrow.  So I'll see you guys around. ",
