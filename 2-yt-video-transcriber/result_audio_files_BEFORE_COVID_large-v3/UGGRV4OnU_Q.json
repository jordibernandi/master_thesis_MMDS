            "text": "Managers gave you their presentation.  When they submitted their brief, they repeatedly referenced Hunter Biden and Burisma.  They spoke to you for over 21 hours and they referenced Biden or Burisma over 400 times.  And when they gave these presentations, they said there was nothing, nothing to see.  It was a sham.  This is fiction.  In their trial memorandum, the House managers described this as baseless.  Now, why did they say that?  Why did they invoke Biden or Burisma over 400 times?  The reason they needed to do that is because they are here saying that the president must be impeached and removed from office for raising a concern.  And that's why we have to talk about this today.  They say sham, they say baseless, because they say this?  because if it's okay for someone to say, hey, you know what, maybe there's something here worth raising, then their case crumbles.  Because they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no basis to raise this concern.  But that's not what public records show.  Here are just a few of the public sources that flagged questions surrounding this very same issue.  The United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, Hunter Biden's former business associate, an ABC White House reporter, Good Morning America, ABC, The Washington Post, The New York Times, Ukrainian law enforcement, and the Obama State Department itself.  They all raised this issue.  We would prefer not to be talking about this.  We would prefer not to be discussing this.  But the House managers have placed this squarely at issue, so we must address it.  Let's look at the facts.  In early 2014, Joe Biden, our Vice President of the United States, led the United States foreign policy in Ukraine with the goal of rooting out corruption.  According to an annual study published by Transparency International, during this time, Ukraine was one of the most corrupt countries in the entire world.  In Ukraine, there's a natural gas company called Burisma.  Burisma has been owned by an oligarch.  named Mykola Solchevsky.  Here's what happened very shortly after Vice President Biden was made U.S.  point man for Ukraine.  His son Hunter Biden ends up on the board of Burisma, working for and paid by the oligarch Solchevsky.  In February 2014, in the wake of anti-corruption uprising by the people of Ukraine, Zolchevsky flees the country, flees Ukraine.  Zolchevsky, the oligarch, is well known.  George Kent, the very first witness that the Democrats called during their public hearings, testified.  Zolchevsky stood out for his self-dealings even among other oligarchs.  House managers didn't tell you that.  Ambassador Kurt Volkler explained that Burisma had a, quote, very bad reputation as a company for corruption and money laundering, end quote.  House managers didn't tell you that.  Burisma was so corrupt that George Kent said he intervened to prevent USAID from co-sponsoring an event.  with Burisma.  You know what this event was?  It was a child's contest and the prize was a camera.  They were so bad, Burisma, that our country wouldn't even co-sponsor a children's event with Burisma.  In March 2014, the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office opens a money laundering investigation into the oligarch, Solchevsky, and his company, Burisma.  The very next month, April 2014, according to a public report, Hunter Biden quietly joins the board of Burisma.  Remember, early 2014 was when Vice President Biden began leading Ukraine policy.  Here's how Hunter Biden came to join Burisma's board in April 2014.  He was brought on the board by Devin Archer, his business partner.  Devin Archer was college roommates with Chris Hines, stepson of Secretary of State John Kerry.  All three men, Hunter Biden, Devin Archer, and Chris Hines, had all started an investment firm together.  Public records show that April 16, 2014, Devin Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House.  Just two days later, on April 18, 2014, is when Hunter Biden quietly joins Burisma, according to public reporting.  Remember this is just one month after the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office opened a money laundering case into Burisma.  Hunter Biden joins the board.  And not only 10 days after Hunter Biden joins the board, British authorities seize $23 million in British bank accounts connected to the oligarch Zolchevsky, the owner of Burisma.  Did Hunter Biden leave the board then?  No.  The British authorities also announced that it had started a criminal investigation into potential money laundering.  Did Hunter Biden leave the board?  No.  What happened was then?  Only then did the company choose to announce that Hunter Biden had joined the board after the assets of Burisma and his oligarch owner, Zolchevsky, were frozen and a criminal investigation had begun.  Hunter Biden's decision to join Burisma raised flags almost immediately.  One article from May 2014 stated, the appointment of Joe Biden's son to the board of Ukrainian gas firm Burisma has raised eyebrows the world over.  Even an outlet with bias for Democrats pointed out Hunter Biden's activities created a conflict of interest for Joe Biden.  The article stated, the move raises questions about a potential conflict of interest for Joe Biden.  Now even Chris Hines, Hunter Biden's own business partner, had grave concerns.  He thought that working with Burisma was unacceptable.  This is Chris Hines.  He was worried about the corruption, the geopolitical risk, and how bad it would look.  So he wisely distances himself from Hunter Biden and Devin Archer's appointments to Burisma.  He didn't simply call his stepfather, Secretary of State, and say, I have a problem with this.  He didn't tell his friends, hey guys, I'm not getting on the board.  I want nothing to do with this.  He went so far as to send an email to senior State Department officials about this issue.  This is Chris Hines.  He wrote, apparently Devin and Hunter have joined the board of Burisma and a press release went out today.  I can't speak to why they decided to, but there is no investment by our firm in their company.  What did Hunter Biden do?  He stayed on the board.  What did Chris Hines do?  He subsequently stopped doing business with his college roommate, Devin Archer, and his friend, Hunter Biden.  Chris Hines' spokesperson said, The lack of judgment in this matter was a major catalyst for Mr.  Heinz ending his business relationship with Mr.  Archer and Mr.  Biden.  the media also noticed.  the same day an abc news reporter asked obama white house press secretary jay kearney about it.  here's what happened hunter biden has not taken a position with the largest oil and gas company holding company in ukraine.  is there any concern about at least the appearance of a uh of a conflict there see the vice president.

            "text": "In fact, every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest.  Multiple House Democrat witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and others, unanimously testified there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest.  These were their witnesses.  How much money did Hunter Biden get for being on the board?  Well, if you start looking at these bank records, according to reports, between April 2014 and October 2015, Burisma paid more than $3.1 million to Devin Archer and Hunter Biden.  That's over the course of a year and a half.  How do we know this?  Some of Devin Archer's bank records were disclosed during an unrelated federal criminal case having nothing to do with Hunter Biden.  These bank records show 17 months that Burisma wired two payments of $83,333, not just for one month, for two months, for three months, but for 17 months.  According to Reuters, sources report that of the two payments of $83,333 each, one was for Hunter Biden and one Devin Archer.  Now, Hunter Biden was paid significantly more than board members for major U.S.  Fortune 100 companies, such as Goldman Sachs, Comcast, Citigroup, The typical board member of these Fortune 100 companies, we know they're titans of their industry, they're highly qualified, and as such, they're well compensated.  Even so, Hunter Biden was paid significantly more.  This is how well he was compensated.  So Hunter Biden is paid over $83,000 a month.  while the average American family of four during that time each year made less than $54,000.  And that's according to U.S ",
