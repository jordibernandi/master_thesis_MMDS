If people talk about having insurance, there are millions of people who have insurance, they can't go to the doctor, and when they come out of the hospital, they go bankrupt.  All right?  What I am talking about, and others up here are talking about, is no deductibles and no co-payments.  And Jake, your question is a Republican talking point.  At the end of the day, and by the way, and by the way, by the way, the healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program.  Let's be clear what this debate is about.  Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system.  What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years, the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent $4.5 billion of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions.  That is why when I went to Canada the other day, people paid one-tenth the price in Canada for insulin that they're paying in the United States. ",
