            "text": "Welcome back to Redirecting.  So I've had a number of you share with me the release of the camera footage from the police department concerning Diamond Ross.  Now as I'm watching this, I'm going to just provide commentary while I'm showing it on the screen and as I'm watching this.  Now there was footage prior to this that actually showed her in the vehicle.  That footage was very, very difficult to watch.  As she was in the back of the vehicle, you could see where she was having trouble breathing, where she was.  You saw when she was very mobile and she was doing things and kicking on the door and the window or the partition between the front and the back of the car.  You saw all of that.  But then you saw where she started having difficulty breathing.  And I do believe at that moment she was probably already at death's door.  Even though her body was moving, she was right there.  When they brought her in, the way they treated her was just like a rag doll, like trash.  You see how they just flopped her over in the chair and her head just flops back.  And there was no care or concern in placing her in there gently, none whatsoever.  But I'm going to tell you some of the parts that I had difficulty watching in all of this.  If you notice, throughout this whole scene that you're seeing or that you're viewing, there are various racial groups represented here.  As far as the officers, we're seeing white officers and black officers.  Now, the part that really, really bothers me is not how the white people are handling her because this is how they have done historically.  When I say that, I'm not saying that it doesn't bother me, their responses to it all.  I'm just saying that this is what we've come to expect.  Okay?  It is what it is.  The part that I'm having trouble dealing with is how the several black officers that enter into that space and see this woman in the state that she is in.  The black male officers, the black female officers, all of them seem to be completely cut off from the fact that this woman Look at that guy.  He just went over there and I know when he looked at her, he was looking to see if she was dead or alive.  So he went over there and I know in his heart of hearts, he knew at that moment that she was no longer with us, but he decided, Hey, I'm just going to walk away.  Now look at this guy.  He goes in there, he lifts her head up and watch this.  He's moving her around.  No movement.  And so now he decides, okay, I'm just going to lean her head up against this hard wall as if he's doing her some type of favor.  And I'm pretty sure that guy knew that she was no longer with us, that she was deceased.  And so everyone just goes about looking at him.  He gets something to wipe his hands.  Oh, I just touched her head.  Let me wipe my hands.  Looks like another black guy wiping his hands and arms because he just touched her.  She's sitting there in that cage and these people, black and white, appear to be so soulless that they don't care that this woman probably gave up the ghost, that she's probably dead.  Look at this one.  You can see his feet like he's leaning up against a wall.  You know how you do that one foot on the ground and the other is kind of like on the kick toe or whatever.  Again, I believe that's another one of the black men.  I'm just kind of looking at this as I'm speaking and everyone just going about their business, doing their job while another human being is either laying there suffering or has already passed away and they just don't care.  And so he goes in, he takes a peek over, he looks over, okay, whatever, whatever, who cares, okay, walks past again as if you think that's a normal thing.  Okay, so now we have more people coming into the room.  Okay, this person is doing what?  More black people enter into the space.  Look at that.  More black people.  Looks like they're putting on gloves, showing paperwork to their comrade.  Nonchalant.  Okay.  Everybody's putting on their gear.  Peek over there.  You know something's going on, woman.  You're looking in there.  You know something's going on.  But in your dark mind, the only thing you care about is the job that you're getting paid for.  But that soul, that body, that person, that human being, someone's sister, someone's cousin, someone's daughter, Where is the care and concern for her?  And how many times are you going to pick up a box?  It's like all this back and forth, gallivanting, walking back and forth.  I have a feeling someone has already told her that the woman is dead.  Okay, look at everybody there.  Look at them.  Look at them.  Okay, let's get her out of here.  Let's go on and get her out of here.  This person that we don't care about.  Look at this.  Let me just move her legs so you can do your job easier.  Okay.  Yeah, I have mercy.  Okay.  So now the black woman is lifting up her head.  No care in the world.  That could be your sister.  That could be your cousin, your aunt.  Now she's beaten all on her chest.  They know something's going on.  They already knew it.  I believe before she came in and put the gloves on that they already knew something was going on with that woman.  Look at her completely cold.  Okay.  Let me get the gloves off.  Let me get out of here.  I'm done.  Get the gloves off.  I'm out of here.  Look at this guy.  He looks at, okay, no big deal.  I'm out of here.  Whatever.  Let me grab this.  I'm out of here.  Look at this.  Okay.  So everyone is just looking at her.  Okay.  Let me see if she's breathing.  He puts his hand over her mouth.  You're trying to see, okay, is she moving?  Is she moving?  Look at these cold-hearted people, black and white.  Cold-hearted people.  You know she's gone.  This is why the scripture says, Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.  They know she is gone.  But look at these cold-hearted devils, black and white, so cold.  That is no big deal to them.  She has her backpack on.  Oh, what's going on over there?  Somebody dead?  Oh, let me get on out of here.  Look at that.  I can't say that it's unbelievable to me how humanity has shaped up because Okay, now what are you standing there for?  What are you looking at her for?  What are you standing there for?  It seems as though our people are trained to not care anymore about each other.  Okay, she's coming back.  She's putting on gloves again.  For what?  Why are you putting on gloves again?  You already had on some.  She don't know what she want to do.  She picked the gloves up.  She put them down.  It's almost as if these people are just, I don't know, in the twilight zone.  It's almost as if they don't care.  They're just doing their jobs.  Everybody's so busy wiping and washing hands.  Look at all of this.  Even people who didn't touch her.  Everybody back and forth.  This poor soul is here.  Everybody's grabbing things.  Now, I'm not sure if the guy that's right there now is someone who was arrested with her.  But if he was, if he was, or even if he wasn't, he's another black guy.  There's going to be a moment where he's going to turn around and look at her too.  And everybody is completely unfazed, completely unfazed by what has happened to this woman, how she met her end, how she suffered in those last moments.  It's all about getting the job done.  When dealing with people becomes just a job to you in situations like this, look at them.  It's like her dead body is just sitting there in their way.  Nobody cares if she crossed over in peace or anything.  She's just there.  Cold-hearted people.  This is why sometimes, you know, I know that we have enemies without.  We have an established enemy that was prophesied.  But there's one enemy we keep forgetting about.  those that look just like us.  Look at him.  See, he looks back at her now, looks back at her now.  If that's his friend, is he not concerned?  Is he, is he that high or drunk to where he doesn't realize that his friend or this woman that he knows at least, I don't know if they were friends or this black woman, even if you weren't friends, I don't know, but she is a person.  Who belongs to someone.  Someone gave birth to her.  She's someone's child.  The coldness of the hearts of men is just off the chain.  When I say men, I'm talking about men and women.  People's hearts.  Okay, so now you have the rescue squad.  comes in here and they're going to deal with her.  In the very same way.  Look at them.  Okay, yeah, uh-huh.  I think everybody there knows that she's already dead.  I believe everyone already knows this.  They're going to do something, you know, the rescue squad.  Let's just get the wheelchair out of the way and her body just flops to the ground.  I can't imagine what her family feels looking at this, looking at her knowing that this is how she spent her last moments.  This is why we say to our people all the time, we've got to repent.  Whatever we have done, which we know what we've done to anger our father, we need deliverance out of these situations because for some of us it's very difficult to watch While others are suffering.  Some of our people have become numb to it.  It doesn't matter to them.  They don't care.  They've detached themselves from it.  But for some of us, it's very hard to do.  This is why we've got to do better.  We've got to do more than better, family.  We've got to pray for one another that we can repent.  When I say pray, I'm not saying pray that... You know, a lot of times people pray that a person can just merely have a good life.  You don't get a good life if you're not going to live right.  The Most High has requirements too.  We need to pray that we will all collectively repent because this is one very sad... thing to watch and behold.  This is very sad, difficult to watch as this young woman takes her last breath.  You know, the footage even before this shows the police ride in.  These people, they're not trained to care.  They say protect and serve.  They don't want to protect and serve, especially not black people.  Look at how everybody's just dealing with the situation.  She's just Just a person that they're strapping to the gurney to try to get their job done so that they can get out of there and do whatever it is that they have to do for the rest of their day and get on with their lives.  That is what this is.  Nobody there, no one in that room cares about that woman.  Not one person.  And they're just pretending, in my opinion, popping on her chest.  You know she's already out of there.  You know.  And look at these people.  Oh, okay, back to work now.  Let's get this stuff up out of here.  Time to get back to work.  No care or concern about the soul that just left the building.  And I'm talking about black and white people.  Mosai showed me a long time ago that enemies come in black and white.  Black and white.  Latino, Chinese, Arab, it doesn't matter.  Now many will say, well, yeah, they are doing their job and they can't feel a certain way about every person who comes through.  I've heard people say stuff like that, but when you are a part of the system and it gets to the point where you can't see how the system has wronged your own people and that sometimes the system leads to the death of your own people, then you are part of the problem.  I'm sorry.  I don't care what people say about that, but they are a part of the problem.  The way they brought her in was wrong.  And it is not right.  It made the most high judge of this situation.
