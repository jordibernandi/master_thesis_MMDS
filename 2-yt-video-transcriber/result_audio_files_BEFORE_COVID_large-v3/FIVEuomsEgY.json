            "text": "Howdy.  Everything alright?  Can I help you?  Yeah, just curious.  Can we help you with something?  No, thank you.  Just taking photos?  What does it look like?  Thank you.  How's it going?  Ready to get home again.  Hello.  How you doing?  Hi, how are you?  How's it going, sir?  Hi.  Good morning.  All right, so we've got Anaheim PD here.  And I don't know for what, because I've been out here on the sidewalk the whole time.  I guess they didn't like the fact that I didn't tell them what my story was about.  Get another page in there.  so so All right, well, these guys are learning a valuable lesson today.  We all know that the officer is not going to arrest me or detain me or might try to attempt to identify me, but he knows that I have every right to be here.  How's it going, sir?  Can I talk to you for a minute?  No.  I don't want to talk to you.  You don't want to talk to me?  No.  Can you answer me why almost 99% of police officers don't know how to park their vehicle when they pull up to the scene?  You don't even have your emergency lights on, man.  Somebody can slam into you, and it's going to be your fault because you don't have your emergency lights on.  Can we start with our names, or you don't want to give me your name?  No, I'm not going to answer any of your questions.  I'm just telling you what I've seen wrong with you pulling up here today.  Okay.  What's your name and badge number?  My name is, uh, Sergeant Lee.  My badge number is S-222.  S-222?  Uh-huh.  All right.  You have a good day.  Okay.  Can I give you an advisement?  Try to park properly when you pull up to a scene, man.  You're in the middle of the street.  People aren't going to hit your car, and then I guarantee you'll try to give them a ticket for it.  So I'm going to just keep... Have a good day, man.  Have a good day.  Okay.  I'm letting you know, as you walk the way, if you walk to there properly, you'll be arrested for trespassing.  Did you hear that?  If you walk onto their property, you'll be arrested.  I believe that grass is actually their property.  I don't think so, dude.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Because there's a city poll right here.  Don't you know the law, man?  You're in law enforcement.  Don't you know the law?  Don't you know that this is public easement, or would you like me to walk in the street?  This is a public easement.  This is open to the public, dude.  If there's a city poll there, if there's city signs, it's open to the public.  Well, you could also argue that the property probably maintains the trees over here.  No, I don't think so, dude.  I don't think so.  The city doesn't give property to people just because there's a tree there.  Get the fuck out of here, dude.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  You're fucking trash, dude.  You don't even know the law.  You're out here to enforce the law and you don't even know the law, dude.  That's a disgrace, man.  It's a disgrace to your badge and it's a disgrace to your colors, man.  It's a disgrace to your department because you should know the law.  Coming out here trying to regulate me for doing something that I'm doing perfectly legal, you want to regulate that?  You don't even know the law, man.  Have a nice day, sir.  It's sad.  It's sad that our police officers, Anaheim police, do not know the law.  They do not know the law.  This guy doesn't even know the law.  I don't even know why you called him over here.  He's telling me that this is private property.  Disgrace.  You're a disgrace to the department.  Thank you.  You know, instead of you coming out and educating the people so they don't make false 911 calls, you want to make it worse.  You want to make it worse, dude.  You're fucking trash, man.  You're trash.  You're trash.  You should learn the law if you want to enforce the law.  Go read a book, man.  Get educated.  Come over here and tell me I'm on private property?  You're full of shit, dude.  Time to take out the trash.  Yeah, use your blinker.  There you go.  And do me a favor, put your seatbelt on before I get you a ticket.  Put your seatbelt on, because you're breaking the law.  You're not above the law.  You are not above the law.  So this guy took off without putting his seatbelt on just because he's so butthurt that he couldn't regulate me.  And he tried to tell me that this is private property, knowing that there's a city pole right here.  This is private property.  When I walked on the grass and he said, well, you know, they maintain it because they have trees here.  What a crock of shit.  You guys suck.  You couldn't even get calling the police right.  There it is guys, Lynch Ambulance, Anaheim, California.  You guys let them know I was out here. ",
