            "text": "Hey guys, Alex aka Miga here and today's video, a backpacker dies after taking diarrhea pills from Cambodian pharmacist.  Now, this is a bit of a serious discussion here for all you travelers out there that recently have gone or are planning to going abroad to Southeast Asia, South America and pretty much right around the world.  So, a British backpacker and her pal were found dead in a Cambodian hostel after taking drugs given to them by a local pharmacist for food poisoning, authorities said.  Natalie Seymour, who is 22, sent a final WhatsApp message to her mother saying she was feeling ill and might go get something to make her feel better, before her body was discovered at the Monkey Republic Guesthouse in the southern city of Kompot on Tuesday.  Quote, the hotel manager was going up and down with drinks and told them they should go to a medical center, Seymour's mother, Wendy Bowler, told the outlet.  They decided to slip it off, but never woke up again.  And then they were found by, I don't know.  Seymour and her Canadian friend, Abigail Amisola, who's 27, are believed to have died after overdosing on tablets they bought at a local pharmacy.  And it's most likely Imodium, which is an anti-diarrhea medication.  Quote, we found pills for headaches and dizziness at the scene.  A few of their friends came and told us the girls had eaten something bad and had diarrhea and headaches, so we think they took too much medicine.  Provincial Police Chief Mao told local outlet Khmer Times.  Officials ruled out foul play because they said no marks or bruises were found on the girls' bodies.  They also ruled out the suggestion that the pair had taken their own lives.  Quote, we cannot say it was a suicide because they called for help from guesthouse staff.  at around 3 a.m.  Quote, they were sent to the provincial hospital where they were pronounced dead.  Forensic tests haven't been conducted yet and an exact cause of death has yet to be determined.  Seymour had a passion for travelling and met her Canadian friend while visiting Bali last year.  Quote, they were doing all these sightseeing things.  She loved all that sort of stuff, Seymour's mother said.  She told us every day where she was going and what she was going to be doing.  She always really wanted to travel and just wanted a break from work.  Seymour's Instagram shows she travelled to an island of Cambodia four days ago and other images of trips to the Indonesian Gili Islands, Berlin and Milan.  The grooving mum said her globe-trotting daughter had bought a one-way ticket to Cambodia.  Her body will be returned to England within the next three days.  So, and what this article does not mention is the fact that these girls most likely overdosed on a pharmaceutical drug called Imodium.  So, when you hear of the name Imodium, you probably don't automatically think about a dangerous or potentially deadly drug.  Imodium is on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines.  It's inexpensive and it's available over the counter.  None of those things might seem like something that would be part of the opioid epidemic.  that can lead to overdoses and death, but at high doses, it is possible to overdose on Imodium and it's becoming more common than you think.  The following provides an overview of what Imodium is and why it's becoming such a problematic medication as the opioid epidemic ravages the nation.  So, Imodium is the brand name of the generic medication known as laparamide.  Its primary use is to help with diarrhea.  It slows the activity of the gastrointestinal system so that people who use it will experience less diarrhea and less watery stools.  It can be a helpful medicine because excessive diarrhea can lead to complications such as dehydration.  Imodium, when used at recommended doses, is considered a safe medicine and the side effects are pretty minimal.  Some of the possible side effects of Imodium used at proper doses can include drowsiness, nausea and vomiting.  Unfortunately, there is a dark side to Imodium that is becoming increasingly problematic.  Opiates are also commonly called opiates, are a class of drugs that include prescription painkillers and heroin.  Addiction to these drugs has overtaken the nation in many ways and it affects communities rich and poor and everything in between.  Some of the blame of the opioid epidemic lies in the loose prescription regulations for these drugs early on in the 90s.  And to be fair, a lot of physicians and individuals probably didn't understand the addictive nature of these substances.  Opioid abuse has grown so much that it's considered one of the biggest public health crises affecting the US and there's little relief in sight.  There has been steps taken to tighten up regulations and restrictions related to prescription opiates.  But because of this, some people have moved on to heroin and others have looked for alternative ways to get high or fend off withdrawal symptoms.  One such alternative is Imodium.  Imodium is technically an opiate because it activates the same receptors as pain medicines and heroin.  However, when Imodium is taken as instructed at normal doses, very little of it is absorbed and not much of it becomes available in the bloodstream.  As a result, it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier.  It means that typically Imodium wouldn't cause people to feel high as with other opiates, nor would it provide pain relief.  However, at very high doses, Imodium can create the euphoric high addicts chase with opiates.  It's become a significant problem because Imodium can be very dangerous or deadly when taken in large doses, and the deaths resulting from this anti-diarrhea drug are on the rise.  So, as the first article failed to mention that these girls most likely took Imodium because literally they fell asleep and never wake up again.  so there you go guys when you're traveling around the world and you've got a diarrhea be careful when taking anti-diarrhea drugs like imodium because if you take too much you just might not wake up again.  and this is a serious topic.  i'm not even joking about this.  so let this be a reminder to you all to look after yourself stay healthy and sometimes it's just better to sit in the toilet and let it all go through.  i mean i was in thailand last year and i got a really really bad case of food poisoning that lasted for about three days.  i did not eat a thing for three days.  i was lucky to have made it because i literally was taking activated charcoal to get rid of all the toxicity and I started drinking Lugol's iodine with water and the other thing which really helped a lot was those salts that you can buy from pharmacies.  you just it's fruit salts.  you mix it in with a bit of water and drink it and it rehydrates you.  so yeah pretty much anything I drank came out the other end and I did not have any appetite.  I lost a bunch of weight so it was a pretty bad time for me.  But yeah, I did not end up taking any Imodium and I made it.  Anyway, guys, thanks so much for watching this video.
