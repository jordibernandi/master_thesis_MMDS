            "text": "Well, this is gonna be a bit of an interesting one.  I'm gonna sit across from the screen from you and try to make the case that God is a Yandere anime girl.  So, you know what that means.  Alrighty, so before we get into the video proper, first we have to get fan art out of the way, and then I might need to give a few definitions.  So starting with fan art, we have That's Really Straight from Kirby, a Pirate Cirrus from Ruohi, and then some hot sauce flavored sandwich absurdism from Spooky Boy Ray.  As always, I deeply appreciate all of your fan art submissions, and let's get into the definitions.  So, what is a yandere, or a yandere, depending on if you want to get anal about the pronunciation?  Well, it's a Japanese term for someone who's initially very loving and gentle, or at least innocent, before their devotion becomes destructive in nature, often through violence and or brutality.  is someone who seems like they should be loved, but if that love isn't properly reciprocated, then brutality occurs.  This is a term that's become popularized through animes like Miraniki, and if you haven't seen it, well, ironically, the premise of the anime is that a bunch of kids get together, and participate in a survival game to determine which one of them gets to become God of the Universe.  The show's protagonist is Yuki, with the potential love interest Yuno being the yandere at hand.  I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that every time that Yuno thinks that Yuki is going to fall in love with someone else, or even start spending time with them, this tends to happen.  Thank you.  So, given that we know that the God of the Bible definitely has the brutality in check as well, I mean, flooding the entire world, or even a local region if you want to take that interpretation, that constitutes a lot of killing.  So we know that any run-of-the-mill Yandere and God probably have something that they can at least share tea over and converse about.  The murdering of everybody who doesn't lay down and worship them, or love them.  In Yuno's case, it's potential lovers for Yuki, and in God's case, it's potential gods that other people would follow.  Do you want to potentially follow a different religion other than the one that God wants you to? ",

And of course, if you don't love God back, then I guess it's time for you to get the eternal hellfire, or in Yuno's case, the bite of the axe that everybody else has been suffering with up until this point.  The point I'm trying to make here is that the type of love that you would get from a yandere that's filled with brutality, obsession, and constant threat of personal harm is the same type of love that we see from the God of the Bible.  Don't believe me?  Well, then why don't we go ahead and get our yandere God to quote Exodus 20, verse 5.  So if If you worship or serve any other god, that's not good for God at all.  His jealousy just can't take it.  Much like with the Yandere, if they're not the center of your world, then everyone you love is at risk.  At least in Yuno's case, he didn't threaten to kill everybody in the generations after Yuki.  But let's move on to the next verse.  Perhaps Deuteronomy 4, 23 through 24. ",

I don't know why I even asked that question.  Oh, and don't try to make any arguments about bodily autonomy, because, well, both the Andre and God, really there's not much of a distinction at this point, have definitely claimed your body as theirs.

The type of love that God wants you to reciprocate to him is absolutely horrendous.  I'm sorry, but if there's anyone that would be willing to kill me and or my loved ones if I didn't love them properly, I think that would give me incentive to just not love them.  Ever.  And any argument that God is well within his rights to receive that kind of love from you, nay, demand it, would rest solely on the fact that God is more powerful than other people, at least in the biblical mythos.  And if I have to love someone just because they have power over me, that sounds like one of the most abusive types of relationship that I could ever possibly find myself in.  Let's ignore bathing the world in fire and revelations.  Let's ignore the biblical flood in Genesis.  Let's ignore the demands to slaughter the Canaanites.  Any being of any type that claims that they deserve my love because they are in power over me can bite the sharp corner of my hammer.  And while most of this video was made to be somewhat funny, honestly, comparing God to an anime schoolgirl is probably going to give me a lot of weird fan art that I'm not prepared for.  I'm just kidding, you guys have already given me technical art, I'm sure I can handle it.  In reality, my hopes is that this video can open at least a few people's eyes into the type of God that they're told they need to worship, if it's the biblical God.  Alternatively, if you are in an abusive relationship of some kind, maybe the parallels between the demands of the biblical God will help you realize what you're stuck in, and hopefully help you take the first steps to getting out and getting safe.  Anyways, with all that said, if you guys think I made a good enough case that God is a yandere, then let me know in the comment section below.  If you disagree, then, well, same place.  If you liked this video, please hit the like button and share it with your friends.  This is one of those ones that I actually really would like to go viral, though I'm fairly certain it won't.  YouTube is a fickle master, after all.  If you want to support me in what I do, then Patreon is always the best place to do that.  You get special roles in my Discord, and you get to see videos as soon as they're produced, as opposed to when they're released.  Though, if you'd rather support me in a one-time type of way, then perhaps go check out my merch store.  It's getting cold here, and there are hoodies there.  If you liked what you see, but you haven't subscribed yet, then please click the button.  It gives me inner warmth.  Anyways, thank you all for watching, and I will see you in the next video.
