Two men live in a spooky lighthouse, but get this, they're about to find out that living in a lighthouse isn't all it's cracked up to be.  The Lighthouse sounds on paper like a deeply inaccessible film.  It's in black and white.  It's in a four by three aspect ratio for some inexplicable reason.  And it's mostly just two guys sitting around and talking.  And sometimes their accents are very silly.  How long have we been on this rock? ",

            "text": "It's the type of movie that maybe you'd hesitate to recommend to a general audience because it sounds like the type of thing that only the artsy or the fartsy would enjoy.  And perhaps I am fartsy, but I found it to be one of the most compelling movies I've seen in years.  I found myself several times just reflexively leaning forward in my seat, just wrapped in attention.  The characters, both of them, felt rich and textured thanks to one incredible performance and one transcendent performance.  It's a film where almost nothing happens for an hour, but somehow all these little incidents just get more and more engrossing.  Like, holy shit, there's a seagull standing in front of a guy!  I don't know what that represents yet, but I do want to find out and I do not trust that seagull.  The movie stars Willem Dafoe as an old-timey lighthouse keeper, Thomas Wake, and Robert Pattinson as his assistant, Ephraim Winslow.  Mystery is woven into everything in this story.  Winslow clearly has some dark secret in his past, and Thomas' motivations are unclear throughout the entire film.  Not to mention, there's some mysterious force on the island where the lighthouse sits, and it has some sort of dark design.  Or is there?  I don't know.  One or maybe both of these men are going mad.  Thomas is sometimes definitely gaslighting Winslow, but other times it may be Winslow's delusions creeping in, or the malevolent influence of the lighthouse itself.  We see the story through Winslow's perspective, but he's very much not a reliable narrator.  And as you watch, you become more and more unsure of what you're seeing, just like he is.  The main thrust of the story is the relationship between Thomas and Winslow.  Sometimes it's cold and distant.  Sometimes it's intimate and loving.  And sometimes it's passionate hatred.  Both men hate each other's guts, but they also need each other, but they also can't live with each other.  Sometimes they manage to convince themselves that they love one another, but then their conflicting personalities always destroy any camaraderie.  Both men struggle for control over their deteriorating situation as bit by bit every sense of comfort or safety is stripped away from them.  Thomas has a pathological need to be in control of Winslow.  he has to make him his subordinate and constantly belittles him to keep him in line.  winslow for his part wants to be respected and when he fails to get that it eats away at him making him resentful.  At the same time, Winslow wants to keep an emotional distance from Thomas, while Thomas wants to make Winslow emotionally dependent on him.  From the very beginning, the situation is very clearly going to implode, and as the two men lose control of their environment and their minds, the tension becomes almost unbearable.  Based on that description, you'd probably not realize how many fart jokes are in the movie.  It is a plot point that Thomas farts all the time.  Each time he does it, it's funny, but in some incredible balancing act, it never quite breaks the tension.  Farts just make Winslow angrier and angrier and steal any sense of drama or intrigue that he longs to feel.  He wants to be a serious man, but even his homicidal rage is ruined by farts.  And surprise, surprise, Willem Dafoe is unbelievable in this movie.  He delivers one particular monologue where the camera just sits on his face for what feels like ten uninterrupted minutes, but definitely was not ten uninterrupted minutes.  And he just spits invective, and gradually that turns into him realizing just how hurt he is by Winslow's constant rejection and defiance.  Thomas is an incredibly realized character.  He's cunning, manipulative, literate, lonely, sometimes abrasive, sometimes gracious, and more often than not, entirely full of shit.  He's deeply superstitious, but also skeptical of magical claims, but also knows about the potentially supernatural secret of the lighthouse and works to keep that knowledge to himself.  Robert Pattinson gives a great performance too, but I mean, it's really not up to the task of meeting Defoe's.  And I know, Pattinson was in some movies that people don't like because they were for girls.  Eww.  But can we all just grow up for a minute and just accept that this dude's gonna be in movies?  And he's usually gonna do a really good job?  And he's gonna be Batman and we should all just fucking chill out?  I mentioned that up front so that you know that the critique I'm about to give is offered in good faith.  Where the fuck is his accent in this movie?  What's going on with that accent? ",

            "text": "I mean it's really jarring and I don't know if it's him doing a bad job or if it's some like period accurate accent that they did a bunch of research for and it's actually meant to sound like that.  Is this a Tom Hardy?  Is he doing a Tom Hardy?  Either way, his performance felt best to me when he wasn't speaking, and he does spend a lot of the movie being quiet, so his performance is still quite good.  But more so than anything, the draw here is the atmosphere.  If you've seen The Vivitch, you know what to expect.  That movie really captured the feeling of being isolated in the woods.  And this movie, holy shit, captures the feeling of being isolated on an island at sea.  Everything feels wet.  Don't make that weird.  Everything feels weathered.  The characters seem to always have a cigarette in their mouths, like they're always pacing back and forth, even when they're doing other things, even when they're sitting still.  The 4 by 3 aspect ratio makes you feel cramped, stuck together, too close to these characters.  You feel the texture of the water, the seaweed, the old knotty wood in stark black and white.  This movie is part Herman Melville, part Edgar Allan Poe, part H.P.  Lovecraft, and part Alfred Hitchcock.  I'd highly recommend it, but let's face it, if you've listened to me talk about it for this long, chances are pretty good that you would have been pretty interested in it either way, really.  I will mention, though, that there is one scene of horrific animal cruelty against the seagull.  If that type of thing bothers you because you're not a heartless monster like the rest of us, then, you know, keep that in mind.  The Lighthouse is exactly the type of movie I want to see more of.  It's exactly what I love about movies and just, like, friggin' stories in general.  And that didn't exactly surprise me because that's exactly how I felt about The Vavitch.  If it sounds like it's going to be too dense or unapproachable, I promise you, it isn't.  It's far more approachable than The Vivitch.  If you had trouble following that movie because of the dialect, you're still going to be able to keep up with this one.  It's much more approachable.  Also, in case you're still on the fence, this movie shows a full-on shot of a mermaid's genitals at one point.  And that's got to make you curious, right?  What do they got down there?  Like a cloaca?  What do fish vaginas even look like?  Dare you Google?  How do you know if it's even a fish vagina?  Maybe it's a human vagina on the fish part of a mermaid.  Maybe it's some sort of new genitals that you've never heard of.  You're just going to have to watch the movie to find out.  That should be on the poster.  You have to watch this movie to find out what kind of genitals a mermaid's got.  Thanks for watching this video.  Click the like and subscribe button because of all of the good work I did today.
