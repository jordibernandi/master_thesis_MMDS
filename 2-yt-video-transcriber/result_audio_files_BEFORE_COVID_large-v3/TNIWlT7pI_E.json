As I said, this weekend saw the release of the Charlie's Angel movie from director, you're right, Elizabeth Banks, I thought she was just the producer.  The reboot follows the footsteps of a classic television show, yada yada, not really, because they actually took a lot of liberties with it.  You've had 37 Spider-Man movies and you're not complaining, Banks says.  I think women are allowed to have one or two action franchises.  Every 17 years, I feel totally fine with that.  Just this year, we've had Alita.  We've had Captain Marvel.  Again, it's debatable as to the quality of the movie, but it did make money somehow.  But then we also had bombs like Dark Fate.
