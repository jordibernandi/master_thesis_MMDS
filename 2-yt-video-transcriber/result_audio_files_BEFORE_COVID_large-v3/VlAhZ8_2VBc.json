            "text": "my gosh y'all so hot.  it's so hot out here today.  I hope y'all are staying cool.  my thermometer in my car says 102.  I believe it's.  um I believe that's backwards.  I believe it's 201.  Y'all, I just wanted to come on here and tell you guys an amazing dream that I received from the Lord.  that is super encouraging.  I'm not going to put my seatbelt on yet.  I ain't going nowhere.  I got to talk to y'all first and then I'll drop.  I'm crazy.  I've only received four dreams from the Lord in my lifetime.  The first one was the very first rapture dream I ever received as a child.  I was 10.  Second dream I ever received from the Lord is when he showed me heaven and I saw my Uncle Ronnie up there.  The next one I received was when I saw him coming towards me in the sky from a distance.  I told you guys that one.  And the last one I received was not very long ago when I asked him if he was coming soon soon and he gave me the dream where I was being raptured out of the bed.  Not too terribly long ago.  So, as you can see, the pattern he has only given me four.  And so obviously they are spread out, very, they're spread out, far apart.  So I didn't expect to receive this dream.  I didn't ask for it.  I think it's really awesome when he gives me dreams when I don't have to like desperately beg for them.  He just gave this to me.  I had this dream the night before last.  And so the dream is... pretty short but very significant.  So me and my husband were inside this house, I guess we were in a house, a building somewhere.  I knew we were inside.  And him and I were inside and it was nighttime, it was dark.  I don't know what time it was but it was definitely nighttime.  And all of a sudden we heard something outside.  It wasn't like trumpets or anything.  We heard something, it was more like an explosion.  And so Shane was like, what was that?  So automatically, automatically we went outside and all of a sudden I looked up into the sky and the best way that I can describe it is I saw beams of light coming from the sky.  Mind you, it was nighttime.  So this was lit up beams of light that were kind of like in the shape of a sun ray.  So you know how sun rays are kind of like this but they were beams of light and i also saw what looked like what i didn't know at the time what looked like thousands of stars.  and but these stars weren't at a distance like normal stars are.  these stars were much closer much much closer.  where these were these beams of light were.  and then all of a sudden i had an understanding which the lord gave me um that they were not stars they were angels.  And I then realized once I had the understanding that that they were angels, I had an understanding that what was happening was the rapture.  And as soon as I had that understanding, I myself started to be.  I was being raptured up as well.  And then I woke up and I. That is now the second time that I have literally felt what it feels like to be raptured, basically your soul coming out of your body and being raptured up.  And so I now know what that explosion was or that sound that we heard was the graves being busted open.  that is in the Bible which basically says those who are dead in Christ will rise first and then we will meet the Lord in the air.  and that's I believe that's what that was.  but I also knew in that dream when I when I walked outside I things were just different things you could tell there was a lot of I don't say chaos wheels.  I could feel something was different in the air.  but I, I want to bring that to y'all because first of all, I know my dreams when they are from the Lord and I want you guys to be encouraged because, um, he's trying to tell us those who are watching and waiting, um, and seeking.  He wants us to know, Hey, I am at the door.  I do believe that we are in the season.  Um, Jesus clearly tells us we will know the times and the seasons.  Will we know the specific day or the hour?  No, we will not.  Um, but we can tell.  And if you, you know, if you open the Bible and you read what is in it, and then you look and see what is going on in the world, you see these birth pangs that are intensifying, you know, um, the tornadoes, I think there were just 90 tornadoes, a cluster of 90 tornadoes that hit within the past few days.  Um, the earthquakes, the 8.0 that just hit, um, floods it's it's crazy what's going on and we can.  we can see how things are intensifying.  and Jesus tells us he commands us to watch.  that's why he says that It's going to catch people like a thief in the night.  They're not going to be expecting his return.  He tells us to watch.  So that's what we're doing.  We're watching.  And we can tell that we're in the season.  I saw somebody say something that was very, very... true um you're either a saved sinner or you're a lost sinner.  and guys i'm coming to you as a sinner.  do i want to be perfect and do i want to please my father?  and do i want him?  do i do i not want to sin?  of course.  so i'm coming to you as a sinner myself.  um but guys you're either a lost sinner or you're a saved sinner.  All Jesus wants you to do is accept him into your heart, believe he is who he says he is, and confess your sins to him.  And I just don't want you guys to make it harder than it is.  And if you're truly seeking Jesus out, if you're truly doing that, and you're truly watching, ask for a prophetic dream.  Ask him for a dream, guys.  Sometimes I ask and I don't receive.  sometimes I don't ask and I receive.  but um you know I I don't know why it gives me this dream these dreams but maybe it gives me these dreams because he knows that not only does he want me to know these coming but he wants me to tell you guys too.  so I want you guys to understand that Jesus is coming and he loves you so much and he just wants a relationship with you.  and when I say that you're either a lost sinner or you're a saved sinner That means that if you don't want anything to do with Jesus, if you just decide that, you know what, I'm gonna reject him, then yes, because it says in the Bible that we're all basically doomed to go to hell.  But the amazing thing is, is that Jesus died for us.  He didn't want to see us perish.  So he died for us.  You know, he saved us all.  And all you have to do is accept him into your heart.  So I just wanted to come to you guys with that awesome dream.  I thought that was amazing.  He's basically saying, you know, Chelsea, I'm coming.  Like we're almost there.  I'm right there at the door.  And, um, So I hope that you guys find encouragement in that.  I think it was amazing that, you know, it's so exciting to know that we are in this.  I truly believe that we're going to see him return in this lifetime.  I don't think, you know.  He's coming soon, and he's trying to wake us up, guys.  And what do you do to a world who's rebelling so much and acting out in sin and turning our backs from him?  What is he supposed to do?  That's what he's doing, you know, with all the weather and all the crazy stuff that's happening.  You see it intensify.  You see everything that's going on.  He's trying to shake this world and wake us up.  So wake up, guys.  He's coming.  Don't be asleep when he comes.  Be awake.  Hope you all have an awesome day. ",
