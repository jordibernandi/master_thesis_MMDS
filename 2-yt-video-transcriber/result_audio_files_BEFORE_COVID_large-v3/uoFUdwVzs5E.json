            "text": "You asked us if we needed help.  Now our help is questions.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I'm walking down the street.  Right here, sir.  All right.  This morning, county department.  Identify yourself.  Hey!  I did it by myself?  Yes, sir.  Badge board, 900 officer.  Thank you, sir.  Yes, sir.  Identify yourself immediately.  I'm not going to do it immediately.  You don't do it?  Why not, man?  You don't order me to do it immediately.  My name's Officer TallBadge622.  Thank you.  Got the cool mustache.  I like it.  I wasn't just... What's that?  Who called?  Can you point out that person?  Did security tell you everything was okay?  If dispatch were to get trained... Did you guys talk to security in there, sir?  What's that?  Did you guys talk to security in there when you got here?  When you responded?  Well, where did you go?  What's your name and your badge number?  Right there?  Right's your first name and there's your last name?  I have dyslexia and I can't read.  Can you please identify yourself, sir?  Can I get one of those waters?  You got an extra one of them in there?  You got an extra one of them waters up in here?  Can I check this out?  See if you got anything suspicious up in his bag here?  Touch it.  See what happens.  What's going to happen?  Tell me, sir.  Tell me, sir.  Did you get a call for us over here?  I did get information that you guys were over here.  That feels good.  Yeah, it does.  Is there something that we can help you with?  I don't understand.  Huh?  I don't understand.  What do you mean you don't understand?  Is there anything that we can help you with?  We know how to ask for help.  You can call 911.  I'm not saying that you ask for help.  I'm asking if you'd like to help.  That's just kind of rude.  That's not very nice, sir.  You're an older gentleman.  You should be more respectful, sir.  Okay, we're done.  Unless you guys want some official help.  I don't understand, ma'am.  We didn't call you.  That's kind of silly.  Do you walk up to everybody and ask them if they need help?  How many people do you walk up to and ask them if they need help every day?  You know, actual crimes happen in the sun, too.  Don't be silly.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're silly.  You're silly, sir.  I see the face she made.  Bye-bye.  You're silly, sir.  You want to go in?  Have some respect when you're talking to the public.  We pay taxes.  If not for us, you wouldn't be having dinner on the table.  Sleeping on that bed that you sleep on.  We pay for that, sir.  How much do you get paid, sir?  What is your annual salary, including benefits?  You're riding inside with a bike?  Is that against policy?  You should park the bike outside, sir.  That's dangerous.  That's very dangerous.  You know, sir, that's very dangerous to be riding that bike around in here.  You could hurt somebody.  They're older people, older women, older men.  Ken, here at the city hall right now, dealing with this, where are you?  I'm glad to see you aren't riding your bike around in here.  They act like this matters to us and it doesn't.  We're public servants and we're okay with it.  That's good.  That's very good to know.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  That's fine.  Hold on, let me turn my mic.  Okay.  Are we done here or done?  She asked us if we needed any help, and now he's trying to ask questions.  Well, now, do you think that we need to be talked down by some other person?  I am not talking down to you.  He didn't know what I was talking to about him, but you're just ignoring me.  See, and you're still ignoring me.  You know what?  I am his supervisor, and I will review that video.  Okay?  Because he does have a video camera.  Do you know where to find it?  Oh, of course I do.  Just yours or ours?  Because you guys delete yours sometimes.  No, I have his.  Okay.  I almost opened it because I don't want it to hit you.  See, I'm a gentleman, too.  I can be a gentleman when people are nice to me, I'm nice to them all the time.  Happy day.  Thank you.  Okay.  I was right there.  So is there something that you need from me?  Because you keep following me.  Could you not follow me?  You asked us if you needed help.  Now our help is questions.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I'm walking on sidewalk.  Yes.  Protected legally.  We do need help.  We have questions.  Okay.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.  He had the questions.  He's not finished.  He's not finished.  Hey, you know what?  This is not a call for service.  So really?  I have other things that I need.  You said you got called?  Yes, he did.  Wow.  This lady's off the hook, yo.  Oh, we have the dirt bike quads, yo.  Oh, look at these dirt bikes, yo.  Damn, they got the dirt bikes.  Yeah.  Come on.  Damn.  Look at them.  They got the dirt bike squad out here.  Sacramento, man.  That's crazy.  Hey, sir.  Shoot.  915.  So it's either going to be.  Excuse me, sir.  Officer, I would go desk in this one, but I think it's going to be 915.  This is probably.  Well, you know what?  As long as it's not a blue light.  Right there.  No problem.  Right.  Officer, you wouldn't happen to have extra water in that box.  I don't.  I'm all out.  All right.  Thanks, though.  Do you guys wear that blue stripe?  bye have a good day.  man.  these wear a uniform.  you know what they're talking about though right maybe like blue light blue flag stuff.  what are these called?  do you know what they're called?  the model of it?  yeah this is a zero a zero god.  i don't know if it has the brand name on it.  it's got four force 6.5. pretty cool.  i never saw that before ever man.  we got more beef going.  Next time I ask you a question, respond.  Have a good day.  Don't be rude.  Watch.  Watch crossing.  Watch the roadways when you cross.  Be careful walking down the street.  Be careful, older gentleman.  Hey, sir, did you find my phone?  I don't have my iPhone.  Okay.  You're silly.  You're silly, son.  Hey.  Pedal off.  Pedal off, Shane.  How y'all doing?  This is her in the car right here, guys.  Yep.  That's the cruiser that she drives.  She got that cruiser.  She got that.  Stop blocking traffic, stupid.  1-1-5-4-0.  You have to train the public.  You should please us over and give him a ticket.  Don't be stupid, too.  You see?  All right, team.  Take it easy.  That's my heart.  Bye-bye.  Hit your film, man.  Hit your film, man.  I love you.  I hope you get better.  I had one of those on for like five years.  No lie.  I'm hoping to take this off.  People.  People.  People.  People.  People.  People.  People. ",
