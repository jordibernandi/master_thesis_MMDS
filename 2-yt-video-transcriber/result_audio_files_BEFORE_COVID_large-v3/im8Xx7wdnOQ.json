            "text": "I'd like to know what your purpose is of videotaping this building or I'll contact the police department.  Why would you call the police for?  Because you're videotaping this building and the employees without anyone's consent.  And what's wrong with that?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Auditing America here in Newport, Rhode Island.  We're at the City Hall.  I'm with Bucket Boy News, and we're doing a First Amendment audit.  We're going to see if they respect our First Amendment right to record in a public place.  And we're going to do a public records request.  Please share, like, and subscribe.  It's nice and warm in here.  Payroll office closed.  Ah, we can't request payroll.  Hi, how are you today?  Do you know when the payroll office will be open?  Yes.  At noon?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I didn't notice.  Thanks.  What services do you guys provide here?  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, yes.  Say something.  Hi.  How are you today?  Good.  I'm just walking around taking pictures of the building.  How are you guys?  Good.  Thanks.  Take care.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Just working on a video.  Thank you very much.  You're very nice.  Yes.  And you are?  Yes.  No, who are you?  I don't know you.  You're approaching me.  Is this a private building?  Okay, so actually it does mean that I could videotape here.  It's just the people's building.  I don't need it.  You're a public employee and this is a public building.  We have the right to come in here and conduct business and document it.  But what business are you conducting?  You haven't identified yourself to me, so I don't have to tell you anything.  Well, I don't need to identify myself.  I'd like to know what your purpose is of videotaping this building, or I'll contact the police department.  Why would you call the police for... Because you're videotaping this building and the employees without anyone's consent.  And what's wrong with that?  I don't need it.  You do not have my permission to use my image.  You need... I don't need it, ma'am.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  It's the First Amendment.  Yes, but do you understand?  when I was in Wilkinson State... All I need to do is give my consent to record you.  But you didn't.  But I already gave my consent to record you.  We pretty much don't need your... We don't want to be rude.  That's fine.  You can call whoever you want, but we're not doing anything wrong.  No, we'll stay down here.  She's calling the police for video recording.  Do you work here?  All right, we'll just wait right here for the police.  Are you a supervisor here, sir?  What can I help you with?  I'm just waiting for the payroll office to be open.  I'm conducting business in the people's building.  I have to write the document.  Of course you do.  Well, she's calling the police because I'm videotaping.  She thinks that she needs to... Can we help you?  Consent.  I need a public records request form.  Okay.  Okay.  We can.  Are you a supervisor?  Let me help.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It would be unfortunate if the police shows up because they should be looking for guys, you know, doing the wrong thing.  What type of public records are you looking for right now?  I want to get payroll documents, whatever you guys release to the public.  Are you looking for a four-year request?  Is that what you're looking for, a four-year information request?  Yes.  For employees and specific employees over here at the city hall.  Hello.  How are you?  I have this gentleman here.  He's looking to do a FOIA request.  So Freedom of Information request.  Sure.  Are you filming at the moment?  We're not sure.  Yes, we're all being filmed everywhere we go.  I just want to document my visit here.  We have the right to do so.  It's perfectly fine.  So public information request form is going to be on the wall over there.  Okay.  I see it.  Very good.  I like that.  you guys have it here.  Okay, cool.  Okay, and how much is the charge?  How much do you guys charge per hour?  You know, if there was something that, you know, she had to charge you for a number of copies or something, she would let you know and she reached out to you saying she has that information.  Okay.  But just to submit a public information request, there isn't any fee.  Well, like if I was to request like a larger file, they would charge me for it.  It would depend on the time that was involved in gathering the information.  Okay, so if there's a fee, am I able to pay it in cash?  I don't see why not.  Okay, cool.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  you thank you.  which way do we come up?  which way you can either come out this way.  did you come in through the front?  um i still want to take a couple of video from the from the building.  but how do i come out this way?  that'll take you right down the front where you can come up these stairways that front door and that'll take you down the stairs.  you're very nice.  thank you very much.  thank you So.  that gentleman was very nice.  That other lady had a terrible attitude.  Is the police here already?  Are you a supervisor here, ma'am?  No?  Okay.  Can you please get one for me?  Or is the supervisor the guy that was here?  I just walked in, so I didn't know.  Oh, okay.  I should have asked that gentleman down there.  Do you have a pen?  I should have asked if they want it.  You have a pen?  How would I be, might not do it, but if I decide to, how would I be able to file a complaint on that lady?  We do have a, I think we used to have a company.  Look.  Look, they record.  Everyone's using their personal phone to record us.  It's okay to do that, but not while at work.  This is it.  Customer satisfaction survey.  Thank you very much.  I'm surprised you guys have these up front.  I've never seen these like this.  Very nice.  I could just mail it here?  Yes, absolutely.  Or you can drop it off.  Oh, they have a drop.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right.  Yes.  You guys are probably looking for me.  I just don't want them wasting their time.  You know, they have more important things to do than just going around looking for a guy with a camera.  Yeah.  Can I have your name and badge number, officer?  What's that?  Can I have your name and badge number, please?  Yeah, I'm Officer Dale.  It's badge 90.  Thank you very much.  How's your day going?  So far, so good.  Good, good.  Yeah, public employees misinformed about public photography.  You ever hear that line?  Photography is not a crime.  Skateboarding is not a crime.  Those are very popular ones here.  No, unfortunately, you don't.  Why?  What do you lose?  What's going on guys?  How's your day going?  Good.  How's your day going?  Doing good.  Thank you for asking.  You guys have business here?  Yeah.  What's your business?  We already have the paperwork.  Are you guys like rushing us?  Yes, we are.  Why?  Do you have any business here besides the paperwork that you got?  I do.  I do.  I finance this place.  I finance this place.  Do you have any other business?  If you have no other proper business in here, then you leave.  Well, video recording is... Why are you getting hostile?  Go with your voice, please.  We're talking... What I'm telling you is if you don't have any business in here, then you need to leave.  Did you do your business?  I'm going to go ahead and fill out the paperwork that I need to do, but video recording is my business, okay?  All right, that's fine.  We can bring video recording... And you need to watch the way that you talk to people because where's the pen?  It's right there.  You need to watch the way that you talk.  I'm sorry, officer.  You're supposed to be courteous and professional.  I am being courteous and professional.  No, you're rushing me out of here.  You're not doing anything right now.  I just, I just, listen, you just got here.  You just got here.  I am.  I've been trying it out.  Right now you're not.  You're rushing me.  I am rushing you.  You don't have that privilege.  I'm going to do it because I already know that you have a bad attitude.  This gentleman over here is very nice.  We'll make you sit here all day.  I have the right to be here all day recording.  It's a First Amendment protected right.  This is not.  No, it is not.  This is not.  No, it is not.  You have to sit here.  My business is recording.  And we're pressed.  You're not press.  Oh, we're not press.  You have credentials.  Oh, credentials.  This guy doesn't even know.  Look, look.  I am the supervisor.  How many people have you arrested for video recording?  None.  Okay, so today's not going to be the... That's not why you're not being arrested, number one.  No, but I know where you're going.  I know where you... You're rushing me into doing this?  You know what?  I'm going to mail it in.  Let's get out of here.  Let's get out of here because you are a tyrant.  You're a very professional young guy.  310.  310.  Danny Turnoff.  Have a good day.  You're a bad cop and that's the reason why we do this.  You have no rights to rush us out of here.  Okay?  Video recording is a job.  Okay?  How do you know this is not my job?  Have a good day.

Remember, if you're a good cop, you got to put bad cops in check.  If you're a good cop, you have to remind him, even though he's your boss...
