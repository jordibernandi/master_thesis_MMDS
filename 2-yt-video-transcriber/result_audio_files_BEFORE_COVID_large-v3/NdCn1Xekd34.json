            "text": "The last few days saw the gathering of G7, seven of the top countries' presidents and prime ministers getting together in France to talk about a lot of issues, including Brexit.  Now, the highlight of the event was the encounter that Boris Johnson had with Emmanuel Macron and a number of other leaders when it comes to the issue of Brexit.  It all started with the French President Macron, who repeated what he has been saying since June.  As the leaders met to discuss Brexit, obviously Boris Johnson came prepared to propose a complete change to Theresa May's deal, not only to be the backstop, but also the \u00a339 billion Brexit bill.  But President Macron, just like what he said back in June, has said that the UK failing to pay the Brexit bill would amount to a sovereign debt default.  And you can guess what Boris Johnson did.  When asked if he had told EU leaders this week that he planned to withhold the money, Mr Johnson told Sky News that, I think what the entire European Union understands is that if it comes out without a deal, then the \u00a339bn is no longer legally pledged.  As I've said many, many times, we will therefore on the 1st of November have the very substantial sums available from that \u00a339 billion to spend on supporting our farmers and indeed for investment in all sorts of areas.  Now Boris' hard no when it comes to the \u00a339bn didn't really go down with the EU fanatics.  The Irish politician Senator Richmond said that there is a massive lack of understanding in the UK on what the Brexit bill actually is.  It's not a punishment payment, It's a settling of accounts based on programs the UK has already benefited from, like CAP, Erasmus, Horizon 2020, and not to mention pensions for British citizens.  But also the deputy director of the pro-EU think tank British Influence criticised the Prime Minister for saying that the UK won't pay the divorce bill.  He said on Twitter that the UK has already agreed to the sum.  He doesn't seem to be happy that apparently we're telling the world that we're not going to continue with our commitment.  And again, he's repeating the whole default on our deadline.  Now the beauty of this weekend was that Since then, every time Boris Johnson was asked about this, he just repeated his answer.  He said, I've already said no.  I'm not going to come up with an excuse or justification.  A no is a no.  Well, we've had other Conservatives coming to his defence.  The Tory MEP, Dan Hannan, has mocked the Remainers' comments, asking why would we want to pay what we don't owe?  He said that the UK has never accepted this sum as a liability.  And he's absolutely right.  It continued by saying that, what does it say to the world that some British remainers are so unbalanced that they now want to pay what we don't owe?  And I guess this is the whole problem because not many people know where this \u00a339bn sum came from.  the whole aspects of the divorce bill and the financial settlements, is not something that was properly and legally and financially calculated.  This is why initially the European Union came and said, okay, you owe us a hundred billion pounds.  This is a negotiated sum by both parties.  And let's not forget that the UK has been the net contributor to the EU budget since the establishment of the European Union.  So if anything, they owe us something.  The House of Lords has already found that our legal balance of obligation amounts to zero.  There's nothing to see here.  This is all political and we know it.  But that wasn't it.  As I said, obviously G7 included seven of the prime ministers and presidents of countries from across the world with an extra guest.  I don't know who invited him, but he was there.  Now, let's have a look at the leaders.  Surely it's G7, so we should have seven, but we have eight.  We have an unexpected guest, number five.  Who is that?  Ah, it's our close friend, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council.  Again, I have no idea why he was there, because if he's representing the European countries, then but firstly it's g7.  so it's about germany france and the uk and we already had leaders from germany france and the uk present.  why are you there?  but secondly he decided to hit back at boris johnson's comments not just on the financial settlements but also no deal in general.

Firstly, the no-deal Brexit is the fault and we all voted for it anyway.  Secondly, if anyone wants to blame someone for a no-deal scenario, it's the European Union's fault.  You created this mess, it's your fault.  But just imagine how sad the situation is right now that the opposition leaders of this country, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, and George Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, have decided to take the side of our opponents.  Yes, both Jeremy Corbyn and George Swinson have defended the European Union, Macron and Donald Tusk on their stance when it comes to Brexit instead of taking the side of Britain.  Well, I'm not surprised personally.  They are so desperate to survive and they're so desperate to come up with any plan to stop Brexit.  And as I said recently, when I was talking to talk radio's Mike Graham, they don't really have any plans.  That's what all their focus is on this vote of no confidence that might happen at some point in September. ",

I think they're in this kind of death throes, some of these MPs, because they know that this is their final throw of the dice, that they know as soon as there's a general election, an awful lot of them are going to be out of a job.  Sarah Wollaston for one, Dominic Green probably for two, and all sorts of other people who have betrayed their constituents.  And they know.  that this is really their kind of final last chance saloon drink and that's why they're playing up so much and they are absolutely getting as close to breaking point.  for me in terms of our you know um confidence in them as they can get as far as the future goes um and as far as the um the sort of the makeup of parliament goes.  it doesn't seem to me um that anybody can stop what it is that boris johnson wants to do.  and i'm now more and more convinced that You know, it is going to be a no-deal Brexit because there isn't anybody else who can sort that out.

How hard is it that for once that you take the size of your own country?
