            "text": "I think the answer is a resounding yes to that, actually.  And I think that it's very different than a postmodern culture.  Postmodernism rejected the idea of objective truth altogether.  And of course, that's self-defeating, as you well know.  You know, if someone says there's no such thing as truth, you simply ask them, is that statement true?  And it all falls apart.  Post-truth is different.  Post-truth doesn't reject.  truth's existence, it just subordinates it to feelings and preferences.  So a post-truth person would say, yeah, there's objective truth, but if it conflicts with my preferences, then I don't care.  My preferences matter more.  So something is post-truth if it elevates feelings and preferences above truth and facts.  And I think what you're seeing today, whether it's in the realm of politics, whether it's in the realm of sexuality, whether it's in the realm of religion, is a post-truth culture that elevates those preferences to the point where if I don't affirm your preferences, now I'm labeled hateful things like bigot or fascist or whatever it might be.  And on all sides we're doing this, on all sides, because we're elevating our agendas above what's true, actually.  I think the way to actually combat that and to come back at this post-truth culture is... forming solid argument, but also showing people what the consequences of living in a post-truth culture actually are.  And the consequences are we lose our sense of reason, we lose our sense of accountability, because our preferences matter more than anything else, and we lose our sense of human value.  How is that the case?  Well, think about it.  We're no longer talking about freedom in this country.  We use the word freedom.  What we really mean is autonomy.  And autonomy comes from two Greek words, autos meaning self, namos meaning law.  So we don't want to be free.  We want to be laws unto ourselves.  Freedom has boundaries, and that boundary is truth.  When you're autonomous, you are a law unto yourself.  Here's the problem.  If my preferences matter more than truth, and someone else's preferences matter more than truth, and I'm a law unto myself, and that person's a law unto themselves, when my preferences clash with their preferences, Truth won't be the deciding factor because truth is on the bottom shelf.  It won't be truth.  It'll be power.  And that is a recipe for chaos where we lose reason, accountability, and a sense of human value.  And that's what happens when truth is gone.  We become enslaved to our autonomy, which is why Jesus so remarkably says in John chapter 8, you will know the truth and this truth will set you free.  Jesus links truth and freedom.  Post-truth says autonomy leads to freedom.  Jesus says it's truth that leads to freedom. ",
