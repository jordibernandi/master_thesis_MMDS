            "text": "Hey everybody, John the Other here.  Obviously.  And I have a hypothetical question for you.  At least it's hypothetical for now.  If you find yourself in a courtroom accused of sexual assault, do you think it would be relevant for your case if the jury knew that you had a previous and ongoing sexual relationship with the person who was accusing you?  I ask because on January 16th this year, the Supreme Court of Canada convened to hear the Alberta Attorney General defend the overturning of a not guilty verdict in an Alberta sexual assault case.  One of the questions asked by the Supreme Court was whether a jury's knowledge of the ongoing casual sexual relationship between the accuser and the accused in that case had any relevance in the prosecution and defense evidence at trial.  As an example, according to the evidence of the defendant in the Supreme Court hearing in question, prior to the events which were claimed to be an assault, the accused and the accuser had gone together into the downstairs of the accused man's house, and he had said, I'm going to fuck you.  The female accuser is said to have smiled when she heard this based on the testimony of the man accused.  However, according to her, she had no memory of how she responded.  But this brings us to the question of context.  If we are in that jury, you and I, and we hear that the man said this to a woman where there was no sexual relationship in his basement, we might get a strong impression that he sounds predatory, that he sounds like a creep.  But what if the man who says this to a woman while they're walking down a flight of stairs to his basement and we know that they have a long-term casual sexual relationship?  Does that knowledge change the situation as we picture it?  And is our new understanding logical, or are we indulging in legally forbidden assumptions?  Because there are two legally forbidden assumptions in sexual assault trials, commonly called the twin myths.  An accuser in a sexual assault trial cannot be assumed due to their sexual history to be a less reliable witness.  The second assumption is that it cannot be suggested that an accuser consented to a sexual act due to that accuser's prior sexual history.  The fact that it is obvious to people outside of courtrooms that a pre-existing sexual relationship makes consenting sexual acts more likely is not addressed in the current law, at least not yet.  Bill C-51 is law in Canada now, and one of the things this new law did was expand the definition of sexual history to include communications of a sexual nature.  This means that any record an accused person might have of consent to sex is not usable in defense evidence without first making an application to use it prior to trial, and of course letting the accuser and the prosecutor know ahead of time that that evidence exists, which gives them opportunity to modify the story of the accusation to bypass that evidence.  I've mentioned this in a number of past videos, but now that it's law, a large number of innocent people are going to go to jail because the evidence they have of their innocence will not be allowed in court, or it will be allowed but they will be maneuvering around it, and that's not good, to say the least.  But the Attorney General of Ontario is not yet satisfied, because it's always possible that a person with evidence of their innocence might somehow be allowed to bring those records to court, and there might not be enough wiggle room for an accuser with a false story to modify their accusation, allowing for conviction of a factually innocent person.  The Ontario Attorney General's Office has a plan to prevent both accused people from bringing their evidence to court and to prevent accusers who are not telling the entire truth to the court from accidentally offering evidence that a defendant might refute with facts.  The video I'm about to play to you now is the Ontario Attorney General's representative outlining the Attorney General's plan to control the evidence. ",
