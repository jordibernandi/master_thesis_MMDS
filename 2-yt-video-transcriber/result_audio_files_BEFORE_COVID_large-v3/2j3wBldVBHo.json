            "text": "Nikola Tesla was a great inventor and a great, great humanitarian.  Well, Tesla wanted to get into his field, which was free, if you will, energy that comes from the surroundings.  He was hired by J.P.  Morgan to work with Westinghouse and Edison companies in the East Coast.  And Tesla said, I've got it made, I think we can now transmit electrical power through the Earth, through the ionosphere, without any wires or telephone poles.  If you gave a device, like a free energy device, a generator that would service all their needs in their home, for free, they could then bring out their creative talents, which they were born with and have been suppressed because they've had to toil for a living.  They could be tremendous artists beyond our dreams, tremendous engineers beyond our dreams.  J.P.  Morgan was not buying it.  He said, no, we're going to have to tear this stuff down.  So Tesla kind of pulled back into himself and decided, you know, well, I guess it's not time for this.  Well, at that time, he was living in the New Yorker Hotel, actually, in New York.  And there was a fellow by the name of Otis Carr, who, he's going to school, and to supplement his income, he worked as a clerk in this hotel.  And Tesla and him became acquainted.  And Carr was a sponge.  He loved science in every way, shape, or form.  And he was a natural scientist.  He believed in the same thing Tesla did, that there's no limits to natural science, and everything should be on a simple level.  Tesla said, they're not interested in my time.  I want you to take everything I can teach you and go in your time and see if they'll listen to you.  And if you don't make it, you're going to have to pass it on because at the rate we're going, we're on a self-destructive course.  Carr said, I will, I will.  And he got his own lab started and started really getting into a lot of free energy devices and building them. ",

And we had magnets, horseshoe magnets, 12 of those around the craft.  So when you started rotating and counter-rotating, as these neutrons went through the field, they would act as a generator and a capacitor in themselves, and they would generate a lot of power, not necessary electrical power, vibrational power.  when you get to the resonant frequency of your surroundings it cancels everything out.  it goes to a zero point and once you've reached zero point then you can go anywhere you want and you're you have your own force field around the craft control its up and down and left and right movements by how fast it spins or other gyros in there.  yeah the ones with the models we have.  we had remotes you know to operate the models but when when you get up into the larger craft it's not necessary because everything then as car was explaining the difference between the brain and the mind is synergetic.  you operate the craft and like it was a friend, like it was a living thing.

And as the light came up and dispersed around this crystal, it lit up the crystal from infrared all the way around to ultraviolet.  And then Carr said, OK, guys, what I want you to do is just clear your brain.  and use your mind.  so this is an experiment and we're going to go outside and back in through what's known as time and space and all you have to do is concentrate on what i'm what i'm about to tell you.  we're going to go down range 10 miles and that 10 miles down range is equated to the vibratory rate of the color aquamarine.  the colors just kind of dissolved and started turning into this brilliant aquamarine and it lit up the whole ship.  and then he said okay that's it boys get out of the craft and we're going to debriefing.  And we looked at each other like, I don't think it worked.  We didn't go anywhere.  We didn't do anything.  And we said, well, it didn't work, did it?  They said, why don't you guys empty your pockets?  And we started pulling out sticks and stones and grass and stuff and putting them on a table.  And I know we didn't have those going in.  And where in the heck did this come from?  And he said, well, you remember I told you about.  the brain has a limited capacity.  It cannot believe beyond its jurisdiction.  It doesn't want to believe anything beyond that.  So you travel with your mind and it will come back to you and all these dots will be filled in as your life progresses.  You'll remember what you did.  It was in retrospect, I did go back now and I do remember going and getting out of the craft.  There was three of us.  We walked down this ramp.  We got out and we went over to a little hillside.  I can see it right now.  We picked up rocks and sticks, put them in our pockets, and we got back on board.

I said this is impossible but I'm doing this and I put it in in and out of the craft and and car was over there.  because he said yeah they said your energy and that's energy and when you understand that and you get a harmonic with energy you get a balance you can do anything.  there's no limit.  so the next day he had another model and we put it up but he was going to accelerate beyond.  he says these retinas are like cameras are flashing at milliseconds and when you flash fast enough things seemingly disappear.  so with that in mind here's our next demonstration.  so we fired this one up And we were all watching it, and I was getting ready to put my hand in it, and the whole thing disappeared right in front of us.  He said, it's quite simple.  Tesla did this all the time in his laboratory, and it's teleported.  He said, well, where did it go?

Maybe it's gone.  Maybe it's still there.  But we just don't see it.  We don't see it.  It's out of our dimension.  And he explained that the mind... when you get when you tune yourself high enough and you get into the mind space instead of the brain space instead of logic or instead of reasoning or instead of all those things you just get up to a sense of knowing you know who and what you are that you're a creative immortal infinite being and we all are and he said every everybody on this planet is are gods by comparison and they don't know it.  they're asleep.  And until they wake up, this is what our job is.  We're making these toys trying to get them to wake up to realize there's no limits to what they can do.  They don't have to live in servitude.  They don't have to live in poverty.  They've just been told that by people that unfortunately want to control things.  Carr explained to us that the brain that we have operates this water vessel which we live in.  But the Energy that inhabits the vessel is who and what we are.  We are energy.  We're not bodies.  The energy is all magnetic in nature.  It's free in nature.  We're swimming in energy.  Well, before we could get any further with it, we were invaded, if you will, by people with a piece of paper that said they were at this time closing us down.  The paper read that we were attempting to overthrow the monetary system of the United States And that could be construed as high treason, and we're shutting you down and confiscating all your equipment.

What did the energy companies do to Carr?  The powers that be, namely the power companies, weren't quite interested in anything to do with Tesla or Carr.  They didn't want this information out.  It was even beyond the energy company.  It was behind, it came down to, and it can be traced to this day, back to the international banking system out of England.
