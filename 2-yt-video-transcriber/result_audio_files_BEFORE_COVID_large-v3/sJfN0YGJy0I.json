            "text": "Alrighty, so we already have a bit of a problem.  You're using possibly one of the most narrow definitions of socialism you can ever find.  As a result, you get to say that Jesus doesn't fit all of these categories, therefore he could not be a socialist.  But remember how in the beginning of the video that I could say I smelled the lack of nuance from here, based on the mere merit of it being a PragerU video?  This is what I'm talking about.  There are types of socialism that are inherently harmful, and there are types that are more benign, and there are types that work more as a graft onto pre-existing capitalist functions.  For instance, New Zealand is not strictly a socialist country.  However, most of their welfare policies are inherently socialistic.  In the United States, we literally have a program called Social Security, a program that, for some reason, people have been trying to get rid of.  But let me go ahead and run through a non-comprehensive list to show you exactly why this narrow view of socialism doesn't make any sense.  Some communist ideologies include utopian socialism, Marxist communism, Marxist Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, mutualism, collectivism, autonomism, democratic socialism, liberal socialism, ethical socialism, libertarian socialism.  Oh, and Here's a few.  Christian socialism, Christian anarchism, and Islamic socialism.  There's also things like green anarchism and sociocracy, but you get the picture.  Trying to paint socialism as any one thing is almost nonsense.  If we were to try to find a defining difference between capitalism and socialism, then it would basically just boil down to who owns the means of production.  In socialism, the people own the means of production, and in capitalism, a capitalist owns the means of production.  There are some forms of socialism where the state owns the means of production, or the government owns it, but there are just as many options for socialism that don't include the state doing anything like that.  Like, say, anarcho-syndicalism.  In this version, the means of production is piloted by a series of trade unions.  Think the Trade Federation in Star Wars, whereas the capitalists would have been the Meuns, the international banking clan.  But I'm starting to overcomplicate the video. ",

In the graphic that you just showed, he literally gave a smaller amount of wealth to one person, and the person with less wealth decided that they wanted to hold on to their money instead of investing it.  That was uneven distribution.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that on an individual basis, but reprimanding the person who had less for not investing as much as the people who had more, and therefore more means to invest, is basically the same thing as asking a standard Joe Schmo citizen to invest as much into charity as J.D.  Rockefeller did.  It says nothing about the kindness of Rockefeller or the kindness of the Joe Schmo.  It says everything about the means to which an individual had access to.  And speaking of the J.D.  Rockefeller thing, let's go ahead and point out that in the United States, giving your wealth back into charity organizations is a tax break.  It's not a measurement of personal kindness, it's literally a write-off to avoid being punished by the government. ",

Let's put it this way.  I would rather give that money through tax dollars to the government if they were willing to pay for things like socialized healthcare.  And anyone that wants to argue against that has effectively just argued against a police force or even a firefighter squad.  as these are also organizations that are primarily funded via tax dollars.  Privatizing of healthcare has led to a crap ton of hikes in prices, and several incidents like EpiPens and insulin no longer being remotely accessible to the people who need them most.  That price hike is a failure of the free market.  So if we could somehow convince the government to work with a single-payer system, then I'd be a little more okay with that.  And then, yeah, I would gladly pay my tax dollars into that.  Your tax dollars also feed into the education system as well, but you guys aren't even a real university, so I don't know why you would care about that.  On the side of righteousness, though, you have the Salvation Army, which has notoriously been homophobic, and in 2001 literally lobbied with the Bush administration to allow discriminatory hiring practices against homosexual individuals.  They have since attempted to explain away their behavior as a method to remain competitive with other non-faith-based charities, but it is faith-based charities that are already given the most leeway in the United States anyways.  Hell, on the topic of the Salvation Army, their track record is so bad they have an entire area on their website as an FAQ dealing with all of the alleged homophobia coming out of that organization.  So in this instance, instead of giving that money to the Salvation Army, I would rather give that money in taxes and then have that money go to people who need it via either welfare programs, education programs, or even health care.

In it, a landowner hires some laborers to pick grapes.  Near the end of the day, he realizes he needs more workers to get the job done.  To recruit them, he agrees to pay a full day's wage for just one hour of work.  When one of the laborers who had worked an entire day complains, the landowner answers, I'm not being unfair to you, friend.  Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?  Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money?  That's a testament to the principles of supply and demand, of private property, and of voluntary contracts, not socialism. ",

William Sloane Coffin actually has used this as an attempt to justify the principle of a living wage, because in the parable, the workers are poor men, and they're working as temporary farmhands during a harvest.  The employer realizes that they would need a full day's pay to feed their families.  And given that the minimum wage for one person and one child has fallen well below the poverty line since the 80s, with one instance of popping above the poverty line and multiple instances of getting dangerously close to the point where a single person couldn't sustain themselves on minimum wage full-time, it would seem to me that the more apt modern use of the parable is to justify a living wage, as opposed to justifying a single capitalist being able to exploit their workers.

Rockefeller, then you've already shot yourself in the foot because there's just as many examples of people brought out of poverty in the United States as there are people who have been shoved into poverty because of just one medical bill or a student loan.  But I don't even have to go that far to prove my point.  The freest market economy in the world today, based on the 2019 Index of Economic Freedom, is Hong Kong.  They rank as 90.2% economically free.  By contrast, the United States ranks at about 78%.  And what do we find in Hong Kong?  Oh!  1 in 5 people live below the poverty line.  Singapore is the second most economically free society in the world, and they too have a massive poverty issue.  They have the largest economic gap in the world for income, and over 43% of their families have to be on economic assistance in order to even get by.  These too are some of the most egregious examples of free markets literally forcing people into poverty.  This is why you need socialized policies as band-aids in order to help out when the free market starts failing the proletariat.  If you're going to make the absolute dumb shit argument that by mere merit of existing the free market lifts people out of poverty, then you're going to have to come with some facts and data and not just, you know, hyperbole.
