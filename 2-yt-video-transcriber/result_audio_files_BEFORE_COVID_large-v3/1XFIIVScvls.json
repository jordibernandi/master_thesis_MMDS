The popular vote is not the deciding factor because the founding fathers designed the United States to be a constitutional republic and not a direct democracy.  The immediate election of the president is to be made by the states in their political characters.  The votes allotted to them are in a compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and co-equal societies, partly as unequal members of the same society.  So the way we vote for president is simple.  Each individual state holds an election, and the candidate that receives the most votes wins the state.  Okay, it's not that simple.  There's a little more to it.  Every 10 years after the United States Census is conducted, each state is assigned congressional districts based on total population.  A densely populated state like New York has 27 congressional districts, While a state like Montana has one congressional district, on top of that, each state has two United States senators.  When you add them all together, you get the number of electoral votes that each state carries.  To win the presidency, you need to receive 270 electoral votes. ",

Every vote should be equal in America, no matter who you are or where you come from.  What's ironic about this is that states like California and New York have more congressional districts because they have a larger population.  According to Pew Research, that includes 2.2 million illegal immigrants living in the state of California and 725,000 illegal immigrants living in New York.
