            "text": "The sixth Democratic debate featured just seven candidates.  Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, and Tom Steyer.  The event was hosted by PBS and Politico in Los Angeles, and was the last debate of 2019 for the Democratic presidential primary contest.  As I had predicted in my predictions video, the debate featured an extended conversation about the impeachment of President Donald Trump, and numerous candidates unloaded on Mayor Pete in regards to his big money fundraising.  But there were also plenty of surprises.  Amy Klobuchar showed a new willingness to attack her fellow moderates, Bernie Sanders avoided taking much heat from lower polling candidates, and Andrew Yang did not end up getting more talking time than he normally does.  Once again, he had less time than any other candidate on stage.  While I will follow up soon with a more extended breakdown of the debate, in this video I'm going to try to be relatively brief and focus in on distinguishing the winners from the losers.  So who can be expected to gain new ground after this debate?  Who failed to make an impact?  And who lost?  Let's begin with the lowest polling candidate in the December debate, Tom Steyer.  As with other low polling candidates, the standard to achieve a real victory in a democratic debate for Steyer is high.  Without serious upward momentum or strong standing in the polls, low polling candidates need to make a serious impact in the debates to propel themselves into serious consideration for the nomination.  In general, Steyer seemed to perform better than usual in this debate.  He seemed more comfortable on stage and delivered reasonably strong arguments in favor of impeachment and about Trump's divisiveness. ",

All in all, Steyer showed improvement, but good for Steyer isn't good.  He failed to effectively articulate or demonstrate why he, above the far more popular choices on stage, should be the nominee.  As a result, it was absolutely a loss for him. ",

But as the frontrunner, it was enough to count as a win.  Even though he escaped undamaged, that doesn't mean he was totally conflict-free.  Biden did spar with Bernie a couple of times with an extended debate over healthcare, but both candidates presented essentially the same arguments they've put forward in the past, and I don't expect either to have left the debate with any harm done to their campaigns as a result.  Bernie Sanders entered this debate in extremely strong shape, surging nationally, in Iowa, and in New Hampshire.  At this point in the race, Sanders appears to be the most viable alternative to Biden, so even a mediocre performance to maintain his momentum would likely be sufficient to count him as a winner of this debate.  And yet, Sanders delivered much more than that.  He clearly distinguished his Iraq vote from that of Biden's, always a strong point to include.  He laid out the specific benefits recipients of a Medicare-for-all system would receive.  He pointed out how unlike Biden and Buttigieg, who have each received contributions from dozens of billionaires, Bernie himself has received zero donations from the billionaire class, and has run a clean grassroots campaign.  He also made a strong argument in favor of his own electability, arguing that his progressive message would increase voter turnout.  He also powerfully laid out what that progressive vision is. ",

Warren used to raise money in the same way and is currently benefiting from that, which damages Warren but does not do anything to help him.  And the classic Hillary Clinton argument, sure, rich people give me money, but that doesn't corrupt me.  This last argument I think has been roundly rejected by Americans.  It's why many candidates in this race decided to reject PAC money, not just Bernie Sanders.  By and large, I believe most people agree that when rich people and corporations give money to candidates, they do so expecting some return on investment.  And that even if and when a wealthy donor does not expect anything in return, a campaign finance system that makes politicians constantly rely on and socialize with wealthy donors creates a disconnect between average people and their leaders in Washington.  Suffering attacks from Klobuchar, Warren, and several others, Buttigieg left this debate badly damaged.  A serious loss, in my view. ",

She might survive that with no issue, were her positioning in the polls particularly strong.  But while she remains a relative frontrunner in this race, averaging in third place nationally, she has continued to plummet in the polls since early October.  A below average performance was certainly less than she needed to steer her campaign onto a path to victory.  I don't anticipate a total collapse for her campaign coming out of the 6th democratic debate, but she's most likely to continue seeing slippage as a result of her performance.  I count this debate as a loss for Elizabeth Warren.  So for the December debate, I see Bernie Sanders as the biggest winner of the night.  Biden, Yang, and Klobuchar delivered winning performances as well.  Warren, Steyer, and especially Buttigieg appeared to be the biggest losers.
