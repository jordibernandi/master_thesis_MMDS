            "text": "A couple years ago, I was in Berkeley, and I've been to Berkeley and Oakland several times, and I noticed this strange phenomenon.  Many of the businesses have far-left protest signs in their windows.  And at first glance, I just assumed most of these businesses support far-left protesters and far-left ideology.  But it wasn't until I went to one establishment that had a sign in their window where I was talking to the bartender.  There's a bar.  There you go.  And the bar, it was a restaurant with a bar.  And the bartender said, you know, we were having a political conversation and they did not sound far left.  In fact, they sounded quite moderate and, you know, kind of liberal.  And I said, so then what's with the sign in the window?  And they said, if we don't put that up, they'll destroy our, they'll smash the windows, they'll loot and rob the store.  You never know.  And I was like, whoa, really?  Yeah.  There were a bunch of stores, all of them.  And some of them were just like a nail salon from Asian immigrants.  And I'm like, oh, yeah, that makes sense.  The violent riots that happened in Oakland, they're terrified.  someone will come and smash their windows.  In France, there was a during.  I think it was France.  No, no, I think it was Germany.  Hamburg.  There is a photo of all of these storefronts smashed out.  Save one with a far left protest sign in the window.  So let's get to the, we'll get back to this, okay?  But let's get to the brass tacks here.  Last night, I should say this morning, about four hours ago, I was greeted at my home by a strange person who tried breaking in.  In this, what you see on the screen here is, this right here is the individual, right?  And I'll play for you the video now.  And I have some sounds and everything, which I don't know if it's going to play properly here.  But you can see them doing, I have no idea what they're doing.  So this is 4.27 a.m.  this morning.  And they, you know, put some stuff in their bag and they just kind of dilly around.  But I've got more footage.  They then walk up to my porch.  And now you can see them right here walking up onto my porch.  After this, something interesting happens.  Now, I'm actually quite angry that the porch light wasn't on.  That's a whole other issue.  What's interesting is that this person walks onto my porch and then does nothing.  At least, that's what I thought at first.  Because in this video, which I'm going to have to drop in a clip over the top because it's not playing the audio.  You can hear them try and actually break in.  I did then have the police come to my house, which you can see here from other surveillance footage at 510.  The police actually got here a little bit earlier than that.  But, you know, they came out, they talked to us.  And so let me tell you what happened.  And I do have some, I don't know, enhanced footage for a better view.  But let me tell you a story.  Let me tell you a story.  I'll tell you why I talked about that thing in the beginning.  This was not a chance encounter, this person coming to my house.  This was not a random person.  They told the police they knew who I was.  But here's the thing.  around 4.27, as it were,  a.m.,  I woke up because I heard a weird noise.  And that was it.  I heard a thump, and all of a sudden I wake up, and I'm thinking to myself, did I just hear a noise?  And what people don't seem to understand is that the mindset you have... When you're alert and awake throughout the day is dramatically different to when you're asleep and just wake up.  Plus, optimism bias, right?  There was one story I heard about a security guard at a bank, saw a bunch of guys running with masks on, and he didn't do anything.  And they asked him why.  later, and he said, I couldn't believe it was actually happening.  Well, so here's what happens.  I wake up at about 427, as the security camera shows, because I heard a noise.  And And I'm groggy, confused.  I've just been pulled out of a deep sleep, and I have no idea what's happening.  My brain's not functioning yet.  And I heard this noise.  My lights were on.  Now, my lights are voice activated because I have the Amazon device.  And my first thought was, must be a critter.  I don't know.  But why are my lights on?  Well, the reality is my lights, for whatever reason, aren't functioning properly.  They like turn on randomly.  It's really annoying.  I think I know why.  But it's like they're supposed to be set on a timer to wake up with the sun.  It's a really frustrating thing.  They're actually really cool, by the way.  But boy, do they not work.  So in the middle of the night, the lights are on.  I hear this noise and I wake up and I think it's nothing.  Maybe the dog, I have no idea.  So then I yell out to my Amazon device, turn the lights off and it fails.  So I yell again and it fails.  So I yell a third time and finally I get the lights to dim down to 1%.  because boy, do these things love giving me the business.  About a couple minutes after that, I hear knocking, and now I realize there actually is someone at my house.  This is weird.  It's 4.30.  It's pitch black outside.  I open up my security cameras, and I can't see a damn thing.  So I'm frustrated.  Why is the porch light off?  It's on specifically for this reason.  They are special bulbs that, you know, so whatever.  I guess we need motion detectors.  But so I'm frustrated by this.  And who's at my house?  at 4.30 knocking?  There's no cars in the road.  I'm like, is one of my neighbors like needing a cup of sugar?  It's like, what is this?  It's really weird.  So I'm not going to get up and go to the front door when this strange person knocking.  And I'll tell you why.  And I'll tell you why.  I talked about what happened in the beginning.  Now, we know who this guy is.  And there's going to be a follow-up.  We have information on this person so far.  There have been threats.  towards the event we're putting on this Saturday.  I don't think or know if this has anything to do with it.  However, due to the nature of the local issues that have been happening, because I live here, and the Antifa people who have been harassing and threatening these businesses, I took this very, very seriously.  Who in their right mind shows up to a house at 4.30 in the?  And it's not my neighbors.  Anybody I know would have sent me a text and said, hey, I need to stop by.  It's an emergency.  And if it was an emergency, they'd be yelling my name.  Now, this was different.  So I texted my brother because I don't know if you guys know my brother.  He's got a YouTube channel as well.  And he's actually here more than I am because I've been doing the traveling and the subverse stuff.  And I messaged him like, hey, someone's knocking on the door.  And he basically responds exactly as I did.  Who in their right mind would show up at 4.30  a.m.,  pitch black, and come knock on our door?  So at least they're knocking, right?  Well, look, they tried breaking in, and I'll get to that.  So we ignored it.  I'm not going to go down and try and figure out who's at my house at 4.30 in the morning.  But then we started hearing noise in the back, like someone may have been trying to break in.  So at that point, I said, I'm calling the cops, right?  The cops are about one block away from me.  So, well, a little bit more than that, but I'm, you know, exaggerating.  But they're close.  The cops are close.  So I call the police and I say, look, and I don't know if I'm overreacting, but someone showed up to my house at 430.  I heard a noise.  They're knocking on the door.  And we're concerned about potential threats.  And we have no idea why this person is here.  Now, look.  At first, we kind of ignored it, but then we heard a noise at the back door, and we think maybe they're knocking to see if anyone's home.  Maybe they want to knock first before breaking in, or it could be somebody who is potentially threatening me or the event.  And I was like, and it's awkward for me to say, but I said, I've come to you guys before and let you know that I have a YouTube channel and that people might try and pull something like this.  And the cops were like, yeah, don't worry about it.  We'll swing by.  Well, this is where it gets interesting.  I'm on the phone with dispatch or communications or whatever.  And he says, did you just meet the officers?  And I said, no.  And he says, you're not with the officers right now.  I said, no, I'm not.  And then I can hear the other cop on the radio saying something about being with the caller.  And he's like, that's not you.  And I'm like, I'm in my house.  There's nobody here.  Like the cops haven't pulled up.  Turns out the cops found the guy.  He was about a block away and they stopped him and they searched him.  The dude claimed he was a big fan of news anchor extraordinaire Tim Pool and that he walked here from Philadelphia, which is about 15 or 20 miles away.  He took a bus from DC and then walked here across the bridge, which to the best of my understanding is not a pedestrian bridge.  Walked to my house at 4.30 in the morning and then, as we believe at the time, knocked on the door to try and share an important story.  So that freaked me out.  And I said, you know, so the cops ended up coming to my house.  That's what you see in this other video.  The cops showed up.  And I'm extremely grateful to them.  They got here really quick.  They were really nice guys.  And, you know, they were calm.  And they made some allusions to the Second Amendment, which I will take very seriously.  And look, I am not a gun control freak.  You know what I mean?  I'm fairly moderate.  So we've had discussion about... home, home defense.  And we're absolutely for it.  So, uh, I talked to the cops and they told me, Hey, we stopped the guy.  We searched him.  He was unarmed.  He claimed to have been a big fan who wanted to share a story with you.  And I said, I don't buy it.  I don't a 4 30 AM visit is an intimidation.  It's about intimidation.  And we're doing this event.  I don't buy it.  Well, here's the thing.  And I'm actually about to go to the police department to follow up after they left.  Uh, as I was talking to the cops, I pulled up the, uh, camera footage and I said, you know what, man, like we, it has infrared on it, but it's just, it's not that good.  And the porch light was off the one night.  it's, it's not supposed to be off, but I guess someone hit the switch and it's really annoying.  Boy, am I frustrated about that?  Um, but you know, the light on, you can see everything perfectly.  And the cop was like, well, you should.  Yeah, I think the guy from my house is back.  if you could send police.  to be great They're on the front porch, I think it's the same guy from this morning.  I have no idea, but I don't know who this is.  So I'm not gonna answer the door.  Yeah, it's one guys That might be the same guy.  I really don't know but considering I don't know if you're the same guy I talked to this morning or what but I Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  And there you go.  So I'll just say this.  I don't know who this person is.  I don't know what they think they're doing.  They just showed back up.  The noise I heard in this video sounds like someone trying to pop the latch on my door.  It was after the cops left that I went through the surveillance footage and heard that noise and realized what woke me up.  Somebody was trying to push on the door and pop it open.  And that's the sound I hear.  And the cops stopped the guy and apparently he just showed back up.  Do not come to my house.  Do not come to my house, especially not right now.  As I was filming this, they came back.  Presumably, I don't know who it was.  We have security cameras.  And there was somebody who looked similar.  I called the cops.  Cops are on their way.  I guess the person just ran off again.  I'm not playing any games.  In the middle of the night, somebody walked up on my porch, made no sounds, because when you try and open my door, it actually doesn't make noise.  But then they made a noise that sounded like they were trying to pop the latch and push on the door at the same time.  And they stood there for several minutes doing nothing.  And I don't know what they were doing.  And then started knocking.  I don't care if they actually are a fan or what their plan is or what they're doing.  But this is either, at the best case scenario, someone's deranged and shut up to my house.  Someone's, I don't know who in their right mind would think it's appropriate to come to my house.  Well, there you go.  As I was filming this video explaining what happened, the person came and I don't know if you heard, I don't know if you can hear the dog barking.  And I checked the camera and there it was.  I just called the cops.  So the most inappropriate thing you could ever possibly do is come to my house.  I don't know who this guy is.  I'm not going to find out either.  The cops are going to deal with it.  He was warned not to come back.  And I have video footage, audio, that sounds like he tried sneaking into my house.  And I don't know what he's doing now.  So you know what?  The cops are going to be here in a second.  And then we'll deal with it.  And I'm going to upload this.  Because, I don't know, I'm crazy, I guess.  But I think it's important to show everything that's happening right now.  with people who are trying to dig up my information, and this is nuts.  This is absolutely nuts.  So I'll end by saying this.  You show up to my house at 4.30 in the morning again, I don't care who you are, and don't be surprised when home defense becomes an issue, if you know what I mean.  And I think a lot of people can understand why that's an important thing for most individuals in their home.  I live in a sleepy middle of nowhere town, kind of.  Not really middle of nowhere, right?  I'm in the suburbs.  But I'm in an area where all of our neighbors, we know each other.  And no one is going to take kindly to someone showing up at 4.30 in the morning and trying to pop my door open.  And I don't know why you did that either.  So you know what?  This is not a fan.  This is freaky.  It's really freaky.  Some people think there's speculation the person's far left.  I don't think that's true.  I don't know why they're doing it.  I just know that somebody got my address and is showing up to my house.  So now the police are involved.  There you go, that's what happened.  Now look, I'll stress this point.  Normally, in the mornings, I'll do a segment talking about news.  But I'm dealing with the police now because of this.  And so this is what I have to do.  And I also think it's important to make sure everybody knows This is what happened and why.  In the event things escalate, because I feel like if I say absolutely nothing, then what ends up happening is if this person comes back in the middle of the night and pulls a weapon and does something crazy, no one's going to have any idea.  Well, now there it is.  Can you believe that?  I don't even know what to say.  I'm sitting right here right now recording this video and all of a sudden the dude comes back.  I get it, man.  Whatever it is you got going on, but the cops are pulling up.  So I'll keep you updated.  Stick around.  Next video is going to be at 1 p.m ",
