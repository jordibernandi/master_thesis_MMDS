We'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of men on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.  You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.  If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin?  Just in the face of this enemy?  Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the Pharaohs?  Should Christ have refused the cross?  Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard around the world? ",

And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.  For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence, on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.  It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations.  Its preparations are concealed, not published.  Its mistakes are buried, not headlined.  Its dissenters are silent, not praised.  No expenditure is questioned.  No rumor is printed.  No secret is revealed. ",
