            "text": "Winchester is a really beautiful town in England.  It preserves some of the medieval character that really gives a town a charm.  It used to be the capital, well at least the capital of Anglo-Saxon Wessex.  well, if not a capital, at least a centre of administration in the 7th and 8th centuries.  In fact, King Alfred took residence here in 871.  And that's why it was considered suitable in 1901 for a statue of the only king of England to attain the title of Great, Alfred the Great.  At the unveiling of the statue, Prime Minister Roseberry said, In him we venerate the ideal Englishman, the perfect sovereign.  the pioneer of England's greatness.  The Victorian novelist and historian Sir Walter Besant described King Alfred as the typical man of our race.  Call him Anglo-Saxon, call him American, call him Australian.  The typical man of our race.  that is best and noblest.  There's another statue of King Alfred in the town called Wantage, which is one of the places I went to school as a boy. ",

            "text": "Hear ye!  Hear ye!  Hear ye!  Christian King Alfred descended from pagan god!  God save the king!  There is also a third statue.  It has a Roman look for some reason.  King Alfred was associated with literacy.  Therefore, it made perfect sense for Alfred University in New York, who take their very name from Alfred, to celebrate their Anglo-Saxon roots and the roots of English literacy with a statue of King Alfred.  But when the statue was erected in 1990, many of the students and faculty opposed it, saying, this represented the image of the dead white European male.  dr linda mitchell who was professor of mediaeval studies at the university said it would be foolish to choose a symbol so exclusive and effective in emphasizing the straight white male power structure of history.  obviously the fact that the statue was depicted wearing a roman toga wasn't gender inclusive enough.  it should be obvious to any sensible person why these people are wrong.  king alfred is a link to the past for all people of anglo-saxon descent.  he was a great man a devout christian but he honoured the past that even came before christianity.  his line the house of wessex continues in our beloved monarchy to-day.  king alfred was the son of king everwolf he of egbert he of eomund he of eifer he of eopa he of ingild and ina the famous king of the west saxons.  they were two brothers the sons of cunred he of ceolwald.  ceolwald of cutha cutha of cuthwin cuthwin of ceolin ceolin of cunric.  cunric of creoda creoda of ceredic ceredic of elisa of esle esle of ywys ywys of wyg wyg of freawyn freawyn of frithulgar frithulgar of brond brond of balde and balde of woden.  now those last few in that genealogy are gods and the last one of course woden i expect you are all familiar with.
