And the reason for that is that I've made it very clear, not only in my videos but on Twitter, that I don't like them.  I don't like their anti-Semitism.  I don't like their use of identity politics.  I don't agree with their aims.  I think that their notion is something like, well, if everybody's going to play identity politics, we're going to play it too, and we're going to win.  And I can certainly understand that motivation, but I think it's a bad game all around.
