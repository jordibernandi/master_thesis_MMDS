            "text": "I think what happens, if you read almost any commentary on 1 Corinthians, you will see that the commentators look at the life situation in which the epistle was written, and they notice that in Corinth, which was an old kind of somewhat\u2026 loose city that a sign of a prostitute was to go around with an uncovered head.  And so the commentators say that in all probability the reason why the Apostle exhorts women to cover their heads during church and all of that is because they don't want to have that cultural scandal.  of appearing like prostitutes.  My problem with that is this.  If the apostle gives an injunction and doesn't give a reason for it, I think it's certainly fair game to speculate to some degree looking at the contemporary culture and say, well, maybe the reason why the apostle gives this injunction is because of this problem in the contemporary culture.  However, as you've already suggested in your question, Paul gives a reason.  And if there's anything that's transcultural, It's that which is rooted and grounded in creation.  And the reason he gives for this is rooted and grounded in creation.  So I think it's a mistake to just dismiss that as a contemporary custom.  that's not applicable today.  Now, I'm in a minority in that point, remember.  I give the minority report there.  Thank you. ",
