            "text": "Shalom, shalom, shalom, Israel.  You know, it is Thursday evening and we're in Houston, Texas.  And so I would bow for everybody who have been praying for us that we make it here safely.  We made it here and actually, You can barely see it in the distance, but the RV is in the background.  And I had a little bit of time, so I walked around this little man-made lake pond that was here at the RV site.  And the mozai, you know, kind of put on my heart to say a word.  to Israel.  And so I thought I would use this opportunity in this scene to do just that.  You know, I started thinking about the fact that we are honestly moving into what is called the last days.  We keep hearing people talk about that over and over and over and over again.  And one of the things I think that is often, I guess, overlooked, especially by those who are constantly being bombarded with like religion and church and Christianity and all that, is that somehow, yeah, is changing, like changing with the times.  As the times change and as people change and as morals change and as political correctness changes, they believe that Yah is changing right along with them.  But I was reading in the book of Malachi, where the king says, for I am Yahuwah, your Elohim, I change not.  And so when you look that term up, I am Yahuwah, your Elohim, he simply said, I'm Yah, your almighty power, and I don't change.  People change.  I don't change.  Times might change, but God does not change.  We read in the book of Hebrews, where it says, Yahushua HaMashiach, the same yesterday, today, and forevermore.  Once again, with the emphasis in the same, he doesn't change.  And The precept that I want to mention tonight in this little short video is I want you to go to Revelation chapter 1 and in your English version of the Holy Scriptures, you're going to see something similar to this.  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.  uh then it'll say something like who was and is and is to come.  and while that is uh the english version we all know that the hebraic version does not say alpha and omega.  we know that the hebraic version of what our king says when he's speaking hebrew we know what he says is i am the aleph and the Tav.  The Aleph and the Tav.  The Aleph representing the ox or strength or leader.  The Aleph, the ox being the most powerful animal that was domesticated, used to work in order to benefit the family.  And the Tav represented the mark or the sign or the covenant.  And since the aleph, or the ox, primary job was to plow, he would be plowing towards something.  And of course, a tav, representing a covenant or a mark or sign, and he would be plowing toward the mark and therefore you or the sign or the covenant.  so in order to keep the oxen going in the straight path there has to be something set up on the other side of the field that would represent the ending or the post or the thing that keeps the person who's plowing in line.  And so when you bring in that particular Hebraic understanding of the term Aleph and Tav, which represents the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which is where we get our word Elohim.  And Aleph is actually spelled with anlamet, which represents a shepherd.  And of course, a Tav, which represents the speak.  So the Aleph is our high power.  And he is the strength.  of Yisrael.  It's actually one of the names of Yah in the Bible, in our scriptures.  And then you see the Tau, which is the last letter in the Hebrew Aleph Bet, and it represents a mark or a sign or a covenant.  Then we see that our Aleph is heading in one particular direction.  He does not deviate from the path.  What is the path?  We know the path is the path of righteousness.  So when Yahakana received the vision on the Isle of Patmos concerning Yahushua, Yahushua says, I am the Isle of Tal.  I change not.  In other words, He says, I'm the Aleph and the Tal, the beginning.  So number one, the way he started this thing, how it started, the beginning of it, it's going to be consistent with how he's going to conclude it because he's the beginning and the end.  He doesn't start it being one kind of Elohim.  and then ends it being a different kind of Elohim.  He doesn't start it by being one type of Almighty and then conclude the journey being a totally different Almighty.  He doesn't have like one set of rules and then at the end, a completely different set of rules.  He doesn't begin this with one set of laws and then end it with a completely different set of laws.  There is not a beginning Torah.  And then when you get to the end, you have a completely different ending to Torah.  You don't have one set of precepts or principles in the beginning.  And then when we get to the end, we are now working with a completely different set of principles or precepts.  No.  The way this started is the way it's going to finish.  And the one who started it is the one who's going to finish it.  And that is our Aleph Tav.  One of the things that we don't get a chance to see throughout scripture is we don't get a chance to see how often this aleph tab is actually mentioned in scripture.  Because we only know English for the most part, we don't know that Aleph Tav, this ap, is mentioned throughout the scriptures thousands and thousands of times.  And so the question arises every time you see Aleph Tav in the Hebrew text is, why is it here?  Or what purpose does it serve?  Or... what is it?  and even a deeper word would be who is it that this that is olive top keeps pointing to?  so by the time you get to the revelation it's just like point blank.  i'm out of top.  so yo sure letting everybody know i'm the olive and the top i'm the beginning and i'm going to end this thing with my covenant with my mark with my sign.  Now, I said I was going to keep this video short and I'm going to do that.  But the last thing I want to say as the sun has went down and you can see that, can't see the trailer no more hardly in the background.  But anyway, what I do want to conclude this little video, this short video is with this.  He says, and I am the one coming back.  That's powerful.  See, he says, I was and is and is to come.  In other words, I was here.  I still am.  And I'm the one coming back.  Not the one who's changed.  Not the one who went from being a Hebrew Israelite to being a European.  not the one who went from being a Hebrew with the faith of Abraham, Isaac, and Yaakov, the Elohim of Abraham, Isaac, and Yaakov, who spoke completely against idols.  He didn't turn into somebody who now is accepting of idols.  No, our king is coming.  And when you look up, this will be he in whom all the law and the prophets written about.  when he says I am the one to come it means that he is the one that we need to be aligning ourselves with Zion.  time is out for playing some kind of weird church games.  time is out for being caught up in all different types of like world religions and it's time to return to the Elohim of our forefathers.  the one was the one who is and the one who is to come.  We better be prepared to meet Yahushua Hamashiach.  We better be prepared to meet the lion of the tribe of Yehudah because he's the one, he's the king who's coming back for his assembly without spot or wrinkle.  And he's right now Even now, walking among his candlesticks.  He's walking among his assemblies.  And hallelujah, he's waking us up before it's everlasting.  Too late.  Just a word of encouragement.  Y'all stay strong and keep your head up.  Our redemption draws near.  Shalom. ",
