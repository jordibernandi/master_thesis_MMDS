Imagine that.  Subjects of another country shaming free citizens in another country for their freedom.  Sadly, there's a growing trend of people living in America who are ashamed of our Second Amendment freedom and even apologize for it.  But not Donovan.  Donovan is confident, borderline cocky about his freedom.  And if you ask me, this is exactly how every gun-owning, law-abiding American citizen should be.  Arrogantly free.  Anti-gunners will say we need to ban guns because they have a right to feel safe.  Actually, you don't have a right to feel safe, but you do have a right to defend yourself.  But for the sake of discussion, let's go with that notion that you have a right to feel safe.  Okay, now what do you do when someone violates your right to feel safe?  I'll tell you what you do, become a victim.  Because in your misguided attempt to feel safe, you got rid of the tool that can actually make you safe in order to feel safe.  And now you have neither safety nor the feeling of safety.  Life is beautiful, but it's short.  So you have to protect it viciously.  Donovan felt safe until he didn't.  But he made himself safe, not because he got rid of his guns, but because he had one.  This is America.  We aren't supposed to give away our freedoms.  We're supposed to embrace and protect them.  Right now, there's a culture war against the Second Amendment, which is why I need your help spreading our message to counter their message.

Let my voice be your voice and let them know you want to keep America tactical because the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  wasn't a suggestion.  It was a directive.  Also, if you're wondering where to get your, I will not comply.  I lost all of my guns in a boating accident.
