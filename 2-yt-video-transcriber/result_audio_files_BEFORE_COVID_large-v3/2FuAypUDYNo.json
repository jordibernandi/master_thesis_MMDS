Oh, this is where I encounter here.  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  You see this hand and you see this head.  It don't belong to the U.S.  government.  You ever been to one of those churches where people look like they were weaned on a pickle?  And I was throwing the F word around.  I'm up here with multiple voices in my head.  I don't even care if we do church.  Go have a donut.  I can tell because in worship, some people were still standing. ",

            "text": "Hello, Brian here.  Welcome to my channel, Bezel T3.  Bezel is the nickname people have given me at work.  T3 is short for triple three, which is my little way of describing the Christian understanding of the Trinity.  You know, one number, that is three, representing one divine being, and yet three distinct numbers, three, three, three, representing everything.  three distinct persons within the one true and living God.  What happens here at my channel is this.  I primarily examine what is happening in some of the more wacky corridors of 21st century evangelicalism.  Now, evangelical is a tricky word these days, because it cuts a swath wide enough to include everything from signs-and-wonders junkies like Patricia King and Sid Roth, to word-of-faith money-grubbers like Ken Copeland and Jesse Duplantis, to megachurch rock stars like Joel Osteen and Brian Houston, to very solid guys like R.C.  Sproul, Tim Keller and Steve Lawson.  From time to time you will find me comparing and contrasting pseudo-Christian organizations and non-Christian worldviews with those of historic, confessional, Trinitarian Christianity.  I believe that the books of the Old and New Testaments are God's very words, inscripturated by men over a 1,500-year period as they were moved along by God the Holy Spirit.  I believe that it is the ultimate authority in all things pertaining to the faith and one's behavior stemming from that faith, once for all, delivered to the saints.  I believe that the Bible, with all its knots and blotches, with all its gritty stories, its flawed individuals and miracles, is, in fact, true.  Jesus, the Christ, the second person of the Trinity, who is Himself the central figure of both the Old and New Testaments, He prayed this to His Father.  He said, sanctify them, talking about us, His disciples, if you are one, Through your truth.  Your word is truth.  Now I don't monetize at all.  I leave up all comments, unless of course they're blatantly profane.  And I want you to know, many people disagree with me.  I've been called Beelzebub more times than I can count, but oddly never Bezalel, who was filled with the Spirit of God.  But of course I digress.  My desire is that everyone who visits this channel will be encouraged or challenged in some way regarding what it is they believe about God, the Bible, mankind, human suffering, and life after death.  So I invite you to come and check out the many videos I've already posted.  And as I try to put out a video every weekend, I encourage you to subscribe.  So look around, put something or someone into my channel.  search, and see what comes up. ",
