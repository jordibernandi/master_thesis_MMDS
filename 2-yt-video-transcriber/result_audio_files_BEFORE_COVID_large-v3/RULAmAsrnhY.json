And which we now know is a code word for find some dirt on Joe Biden's son, Hunter.  I'm curious.  your take on all this and how up to his eyeballs you think Pence is in this this whole mess. ",

It looks like he's more exposed than he ever was during the entire Trump-Russia Mueller probe.  Yeah, he met with Zelensky.  Now, two things to point out here.  He gets two questions about this, right?  The first question is, did he bring up Joe Biden at all?  And he says no.  So definitive, no.  Second question, what did you talk about?  Well, we talked about corruption.  ukraine.  so now we know that that's part of this entire push by trump giuliani apparently bill barr.  bill barr's people say the justice department say that never happened.  um but ted's for the first time looks like he's he could be.  he could be exposed here and you know of course trump himself said that hey i'll release transcripts of pence's phone calls and and meetings of gladly.  so the trump seems ready to put him out there as well.

October 7th, 2016, The Washington Post reports on this, these explosive tapes where Donald Trump is, you know, bragging about molesting women and, you know, how he uses TikTok.  um in the hours after that happens uh republican party donors call up pence's campaign and say we're ready to replace mike pence or trump on the ticket with mike pence.  make him the republican nominee.  pence's people say no and here's why because down in flames more than likely also he would have lost the support of the trump base of vote.  they're thinking about running for the white house in their own right.  that's the goal.  so if you assume that then everything becomes about who controls the trump base of voters.  and in order to do that you have to be unflinchingly loyal to donald trump.  and i just don't see.  you know pence.  i've heard these stories.  we've all heard them before.  there's rumors that pence wants to push him off the cliff and stick the knife in etc.  etc.  toss him under the bus.  it's a.

The capital of Israel has to be moved to Jerusalem.  And the second temple has to be rebuilt.  I was in Israel just a few weeks after Alan Goodman tried to do this back in, I think it was the 80s, where he just ran into the temple mound, threw up a tent.  And then started shooting, killed a whole bunch of people.  And he thought the tent would be the second temple and that immediately the sky would open and Jesus would come down.  And of course he got taken away.  But there's this doomsday theology about, you know, and then of course, you know, all you know war will be erupted will erupt in the middle east.  only a hundred and forty four thousand israelis who survived.  uh... jewish israelis.  they will all convert to christianity and then jesus appears and uh... it's pretty toxic theology but you know a lot of folks israel are more than happy to take their money.  uh... now uh... how does donald trump and mike pence fit into this here?

Some of the foundations, not everything, but it is a key portion of it.  And I wanted to see where Mike Pence fit into that.  So let's talk about his salvation experience for a second here.  1978, he goes to the Ictus Music Festival in Wilmore, Kentucky.  It's right outside Lexington.  It's sort of like Jesus Woodstock.  And he has this experience, and in that at that same time uh paul waverish and morton blackwell take a drive down to to meet with Jerry Falwell, basically create the moral majority.  They link up the conservative movement with this evangelical, sort of Southern Baptist, more Southern Baptist-inspired evangelicalism.  So I really wanted to understand, so is Pence a theocrat?  That question has been floated, we hear that very often.  And let me just say that as best I can tell, the answer is no.  And there's two reasons why I come to that conclusion.  Number one, his friends told me that he does not personally get into a lot of this to serve it.  But if your viewers want it, uh... ask about this to check that google premillennial dispensationalism.  and that's where the the uh... ",

And you see that when you have, when they move the embassy and the first person you have speak there, or not the first person, you have the invocation given by Robert the updated version of Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, that type.  And he believes in this, and he actually flicks at that prophecy, that belief that there will be a doomsday at the end of the world as long as they repopulate Jerusalem with Jewish people.  So, yeah, he actually talks about that at the opening of the embassy last year.  My understanding, though, is that Pence himself does not really buy into this.  to help them out over the years, and we had a very serious conversation.  I said, you know, I asked him, I said, does Pence really buy into this, that there will be, you know, what it says in Revelation, there will be bowls of fire poured forth from the heavens, and that, you know, there will be, you know, the tribulation, the rapture of the tribulation, a judgment day, and then, you know, ultimately the return of Jesus, and You know, aren't there, like, you know, more immediate concerns about that, too, creating a serious holy war by taking sides in this, you know, split in the Middle East?

Back years ago, it must have been six, eight years ago, maybe longer than that, probably longer than that, I debated Mike Pence at the Heritage Foundation.  It was at a Talkers event.  It was at a talk radio convention put on by Talkers magazine.  And maybe a decade before that, I had written an op-ed or I'd written an article that peripherally mentioned the Fairness Doctrine.  And at that time, when I first wrote that a decade earlier, I had bought Rush Limbaugh's line that the Fairness Doctrine that the end of the Fairness Doctrine is what made him possible and that the Fairness Doctrine somehow mandated equality or balance, political balance in media.  That's absolutely not what the Fairness Doctrine says at all.  But anyhow, he's debating Mike Pence about the Fairness Doctrine and saying we need to bring it back.  And he pulls out this piece of paper and he reads this statement about the Fairness Doctrine making Limbaugh possible and all this kind of stuff and how getting rid of it was such a good thing.  And then at the very end he says, you wrote that.  Thank you.  and i'm like yeah you got me.  i did write that and i was misinformed back then.  i have since informed myself.  but he says but you wrote that and and and the whole room i mean they are most of the people.  the rumor right wing talk shows and they're all built up a lot intense and i'm i'm just like he just did is slam to me.  i mean this guy does homework he's a very candy politician he's very smart and i think that we uh... diminish ever taken for granted peril.
