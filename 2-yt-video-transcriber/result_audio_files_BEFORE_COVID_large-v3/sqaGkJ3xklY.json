There's a sickness in America that has robbed these families of these loved ones.  And we have to get to the bottom of it, but in a way that looks at the roots.  And that is tonight's story.  Here are some of the facts.  Every mass major shooting in the United States since 1966 has been committed by a man.  The only woman, in fact, to pull a trigger in four decades was the wife of the San Bernardino killer.  So why is that?  Young women, girls have the same access to guns, the same access to violent video games.  What makes these killers so different?  Dr.  Warren Farrell has been studying men and boys in America for more than four decades.  He sees this hole in their lives, this missing piece in violent young men, as something that has been brewing in a changing America for a very long time.  And it boils down to a number of things, but in part, one element is what he calls the dad deficit. ",

Dr.  Farrell, thank you very much for being here tonight.  It's a pleasure.  It's great to have you here.  I mean, obviously, there's the big picture of what's going on with men and boys in America.  Then there is this subset, very tiny subset, very violent subset.  And you see some common threads among these young men.  And we're still waiting to learn more about the killers over the past couple of days in El Paso and Dayton.  But what is the dad deficit and how do you see it come into play here through your research and study? ",

            "text": "What I found is that in the prison population, in the ISIS population, in the mass shooter population, they all have in common a very high percentage, about 90%, dad-deprived boys.  And what happens when boys are dad-deprived is they don't have a male role model to channel their testosterone constructively.  And the male role model tends, in addition to being just a male role model, dads tend to be much tougher on boundary enforcement, and the boundary enforcement creates postponed gratification, which leads the boys to being able to be successful at school or successful in sports, to feel more proud of themselves, not ashamed of themselves, not withdrawing, not feeling like an outsider.  They get praise from teachers, they get praise from women and male peers, and they get praise at home.  And those boys remain involved in the process.  They're also much more likely to learn how to be empathetic because they do roughhousing with dad.  And then the roughhousing dad says, you put your elbow in your sister's face, there'll be no more roughhousing.  So the boy learns to think of his sister rather than thinking just of himself.  And he learns the difference between being assertive and aggressive.  All these things, empathy and assertiveness, create friendships that allow him to be involved and engaged and feel like his ability to accomplish things allows him to feel a sense of purpose.  So boys with dads involved, the more the father is involved, the more that boy is likely to find, to discover himself and be successful in whatever he discovers. ",

And we are not making an overgeneralization about that.  What we're doing is looking at this subset and trying to figure out where the synapses, you know, break down.  That's not a scientific term in my way, just sort of a way of looking at it.  But we showed that chart in the beginning.  All those men who are mass killers, only one woman among them since 1966.  These young girls, in many cases, grow up in the same circumstances.  Dad has left.  They've got access to the same kind of violent video games.  They have access, in some cases, to guns.  But they don't do it.  Why? ",

Secondly, as they learn, they also don't have as much postponed gratification.  But girls without postponed gratification that don't do as well, boys are still interested in them.  That's not the primary way that boys choose them.  They're more likely to have a mom to empathize with them and work with them, and so they don't have as much tendency toward violence.  doesn't channel itself into negative and purposeless outcomes as often.  However, on average, the children that do best by far and away tend to have a checks and balance parenting of the dad's propensity to do that boundary enforcement and the mom's propensity to do more nurturance.  And when those two come together, those children on average do significantly better. ",

He said, after I picked up the handgun, I brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power.  I was now armed.  Who's the alpha male now?  And you can see the expletive at the end of that. ",

They're much more likely to feel that anger that comes without having jobs.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointed out there's two crises that are occurring in the future.  One is the cyber warfare.  The second is the boy crisis.  And so if we're not preparing our schools with male teachers, with communication systems, teaching girls and boys in elementary school to communicate with each other rather than bully each other, teaching their parents to communicate with each other so that there aren't the divorces that lead to the absence of fathers.
