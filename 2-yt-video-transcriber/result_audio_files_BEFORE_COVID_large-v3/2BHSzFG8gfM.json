            "text": "Like you pointed out, Herod's temple is a massive structure that, you know, dwarfed the temple that Solomon built as far as its amazing structure.  Not that it just won't fit in the city of David.  Let's go back in history and look at, like I said, just the archaeology alone.  I'm not looking at scripture.  I mean, that also supports it, but again, it's interpretive, right?  So it's my interpretation versus yours.  Good, well let's look at the archaeology and let's see if it supports my interpretation or yours, right?  So the archaeology will show you, number one, that what we see today, the slope of David, of the continuation of the same mountain, by the way.  They're not two different mountains, Mount Zion, Mount Moriah, they're one and the same mountain.  The peak is here under the Golden Dome, the very highest point.  the city of David slopes along the mountain down like a thumb.  And right at the point where these people suggest their temple goes with the Gihon Spring and all that, it's in the very bottleneck in one of the most narrow parts of the city of David.  Now today, you can imagine it maybe somewhat that maybe this could fit in this little, in this space that's small, but you have to go back again to the history of where, what was then.  There was less earth, less mountain there, and it was much, much narrower.  A lot of Jerusalem, in fact, a lot of all this, the Kidron Valley was a much steeper valley.  Because that's one of the argumentations is, oh, well, the valley here isn't as steep as recorded.  Well, that's because it's all filled in with earth of 2,000 years, almost 2,000 years worth of dust and debris.  You need to go back in time.  And I know it's hard to imagine for people that live in Texas or Florida or England or China, but if you understand what you're looking at, and I believe the Jewish archaeologists know the terrain better than foreigners do who don't live here, and they have examined the earth and the debris, They've dug very deep down to the bedrocks of a lot of the archaeology.  It all points to what the Jewish people have always believed.  It's not just tradition because that's a lot of things that we get accused of is pushing the tradition.  I don't even talk about tradition.  I'm talking facts versus fiction.  Facts are all evidence.  points towards a temple have been here all the way back to first temple period.  We have that proof.  mm-hmm plus you have the scriptural proof plus you have the eyewitness accounts like Josephus.  and they say well Josephus says that the temple was destroyed.  yeah but he also says that the that the Antonia fort was raised to the ground so that the Romans could access the temple.  They forget to quote Josephus there because they see, oh, look, the temple is still standing. ",

            "text": "It was a very fortified temple and it had a very strong fortification on the northern part to control over it.  that was built, by the way, not by the Romans.  That's the other thing, because they say, well, the Romans do this, and the Romans in Europe build temples, sorry, build forts that match the dimensions of the Temple Mount Plaza.  That's just a very interesting coincidence, actually.  First of all, it wasn't Romans that built it, it was Herod, who was a Jew.  Okay.  Yeah.  So, Herod is the one who builds the plaza, and it's Herod that builds the Fort Antonia to his good buddy, Roman buddy, Anthony.  Right.  And so, it's Herod that builds it.  for him, basically to say, look, I'm going to build this magnanimous thing to make the Jews happy.  I'm also going to build the Romans a fort to control it so they don't feel threatened by this, what's going to seem like a fortification.  Herod's purpose was not to make this huge fortification per se.  It just became that.  It also functioned as both a very strong fortification that the Jews who revolted against Rome actually did use it and fortify it.  But the only way that the Romans were able to finally ransack the temple was to actually destroy the fort.  Again, these are different opinions and different options.  The fort could have been much larger, could have taken more of the north.  That's fine.  There's no issues there as far as how big it was.  It really doesn't matter.  All we know is that it was up here in the north and that we have archaeological findings of the remains of that, plus the remains of the walls that were destroyed.  So everything was razed to the ground.  Because that's what people say, not one stone on top of another.  Well, you're kind of being a stickler to what the scriptural reference is saying.  There's also what is called hyperbole.  that's used in scripture all the time.  That nation was obliterated.  Well, that nation wasn't obliterated.  It was mostly... The same with the temple.  It was mostly destroyed.  And what the Romans did is they tore down the walls to the point where the bricks that were pushed off met.  what then was the wall.  So now you're pushing wall against brick that was pushed over, right?  So you have this pile of stones that meet the wall.  And then basically the point is you can't push anymore.  You can't.  And so that's what the Romans said.  We're done, right?  And that's literally what happened.  So if you're trying to refer to what's standing there today and use that as an example of, well, there's a fort here and it's standing, well, then you're misinterpreting the data that's in front of you.  That was rebuilt times over throughout the centuries.  Ah, so the Coachella is really just part of the, this is the fort.  Oh, here.  Yeah, you see, it actually shows you the red there, that's the... Oh, that's right, okay.  So the Kotel, yes, the Kotel was part of the remaining part of the actual retaining walls of the temple.  Why did they just knock it over?  Like I said, stones meant stones and they basically gave up at that point. ",

            "text": "First of all, yeah, well, the ones pushing this, first of all, I don't think they're into trying to support the U.N.  agenda.  They do say that they support Israel and all that.  That's fine.  But I think what they're really what their main agenda is, is we know that Jesus is the Messiah.  You don't.  We know that the temple, where it really is located, you don't.  It's this ah-ha-ha where, you know, we have this information that you don't have, right?  Or the God chose us and replaced you with us, the church, right?  It plays into that replacement theology.  And again, these are people that don't, they don't say they're replacement theologists.  They don't support, they're not in that camp, right?  Mm-hmm.  But ironically, their theory does play into that camp.  And those who are replacement theologists, and based off of the feedback that we get from our videos and our content, I get a lot of hate.  that says exactly what they say that they don't want to promote is, ah, the Jews wrong, you know, we know better.  It plays into that.  And it plays also, even in the most extreme, in some very strong anti-Semitic rhetoric that I that I see in the feedbacks, but again, it's not coming from these people themselves, the ones who are pushing the theory and pushing the idea.  I think they're pushing the idea, if you're going to talk about the political part, they assume that, oh, If it's in the city of David, this works out great.  Because it's in the city of David, then it's not going to be an issue.  The Al-Aqsa can be there, and they have in their minds this diplomatic way to solve the so-called issue.  Well, they're wrong again, because I happen to come from the background of defense and security, and I have quite a... strong grasp, I think, on the security issues and situation, mainly in the Old City and also in the City of David.  I can't talk about many of the projects, but I've worked a lot of projects, and I can tell you the people in Silwan, the Palestinians, the Arab Muslims in Silwan wouldn't want a temple built there just as much as they would want one up on the Al-Aqsa.  Okay.  And that's just a fact.  So if you have this dreamy idea that, oh, they'll accept that reality as a compromise, well, then you're wrong.  You're a Westerner who comes from the other side of the world who thinks again, and this is my beef a lot with the West and a lot with... you know, started mainly in Great Britain and then carried over into the United States, where Great Britain came in here after World War I, and they created nations, and they cut borders, and they put up leaders to take over and lead those nations, and they thought they were going to solve the Middle East issues.  They were wrong.  They created a mess.  That's why you have the war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Syria, in Jordan, in Egypt.  That's why they're all still trying to kill each other because you didn't really solve anything.  All you did is give these people a nationality which these people don't connect to a nationality identity.  They connect to a tribal identity, to a religious identity.  And those are much different than the Western concepts that Westerners have.  And I would say, as an example of that mess, this is another mess that the West thinking Christian world is thinking they're going to come here and solve.  And they're just wrong.  And I can tell you because I grew up here, and I think I understand the mindset a little bit better as being a local and one who grew up here.  Of course.  Besides, I know the Hebrew scripture, we read the original language, and there's a big difference there too.  If you read your Bible in Hebrew versus if you read it in a translation, Actually, you can easily get two different interpretations, in fact, many interpretations, which is part of the problem that many Christians suffer from is multiple ideas of pick a topic and you'll notice there's different theologies.  That's the why.  It's because how do you read it?  In the Hebrew, it's much simpler.  There's one simple, direct message.  And if you don't connect to that original message from the original people who wrote that message to a specific people, to a specific land, you can come up with all kinds of nice ideas, but you don't have to necessarily be right on that.
