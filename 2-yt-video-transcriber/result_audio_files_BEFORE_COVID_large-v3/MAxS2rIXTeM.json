Is it the district clerk?  District clerk or county clerk?  District.  What do you need me to do?  District clerk.  What do you need me to do?  District clerk, it's all the way down the end of the hall on the left.  Okay.  What you got to come do here.  Okay.  Anything you need.  Keys, cell phones, belts.  Are you on here?  No, in one of these.  Chain.  You'll come to it.  No, yeah.  What are y'all doing today?  Should have hit.  Just.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I thought it said hot chicks, but it's hot checks.  Ask you a question.  What's your policy as far as recording inside the courthouse?  They can record if they want to.  What are you going to do?  I've been recorded.  Oh, that's okay.  We don't care.  We don't do nothing wrong.  I wouldn't think I would, but I go to quite a few courthouses, and they usually handcuff me and take me to jail.  First Amendment comes first, and I appreciate you.  Yeah, as long as you don't tell the problem.  We don't cause a problem.  You're a rarity, and you're Deputy Pinky?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, have a good day. ",
