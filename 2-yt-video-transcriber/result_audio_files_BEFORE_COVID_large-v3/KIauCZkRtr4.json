            "text": "Hey Scaredy Cats, it's me, Scaredy Matt.  You're probably wondering what happened to my face.  It's, I used the wrong guard on my razor.  It's every beard owner's dilemma.  Don't worry, it will grow back.  You're just gonna have to deal with a bit more of a double chin than usual in this particular video.  You know, I'm no expert.  I'm not somebody who's seen every single horror movie.  I probably haven't even seen as much as the average horror fan.  You might notice I said several times that there was an evil Santa Claus in Black Christmas.  There is not.  Oops.  You might notice I referred to Train to Besson as Train to Baton.  Oopsie daisies.  I just like horror movies a lot.  That doesn't necessarily mean that I have a solid foundational grasp on the horror canon.  Which is exciting, because it means that there are still classics out there for me to watch for the first time.  It's just that my brain has all these weird prejudices about some movies.  Like, I don't watch them because maybe I think, oh, I'm not going to like this, or it would be too boring, or maybe I think that they were really influential at the time, but now so many movies have iterated on the formula that it's going to seem basic in comparison.  I was in my 30s before I watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time, which is now one of my favorite movies.  I had this idea in my head of what kind of movie it was.  It was going to be like a broad, hellbilly slasher, kind of like a Rob Zombie movie.  And I also haven't seen any Rob Zombie movies.  But then when I did watch it, it was a slow burn, surreal nightmare.  Like I like!  For years, people have been telling me to watch Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs.  I assumed, based on literally nothing, it would be really boring for some reason.  Somehow, in the 20-odd years I've been a huge Nightmare on Elm Street fan, I never read the synopsis of The People Under the Stairs on Wikipedia, which would have quickly disabused me of that misconception.  The People Under the Stairs is bonkers.  It is one of the bonkersest movies I have ever seen.  It's not the most bonkersest, that's still haosu, but it's up there.  I'm going to show you a brief montage from this movie, and if you're not familiar with it, I want you to try and guess what the movie is trying to say. ",

It's a movie about how class in America keeps some people in permanent poverty and servitude and the perversity of neoconservative social values.  Would you have guessed that from this part?  You know, there was a lot of criticisms I could see someone making of this movie.  Maybe the humor doesn't work for them.  Maybe they find the villains too over the top.  Maybe they disagree with the film's message.  Now, I don't agree with any of those criticisms, but I could see someone making them.  But I specifically thought this movie would be boring.  I thought this movie... would be boring.  The People Under the Stairs follows the adventures of a young man named Poindexter, who everybody calls Fool, because his sister is really into tarot cards and the Fool is his card, and it's a way for the movie to just kind of bluntly tell you this is a movie about a boy learning to overcome childish naivete and become a man.  The first scene is all about this, how the name doesn't mean that he's a dumbo, just that he's ignorant because of a lack of real-world experience and how the world is gonna challenge him. ",

            "text": "There you go.  Don't waste any brain calories trying to interpret Fool's story.  This is what it is.  This is what they meant by it.  Right off the top, very considerate.  Thank you, people under the stairs.  Fool's family is very poor, and they're going to be evicted by their heartless landlords who want to gentrify the shit out of their neighborhood by building a bunch of condos.  Even though their mother is dying of cancer.  In a last ditch effort to pay rent, Fool decides to help this guy, Leroy, break into the landlord's house to steal a stash of gold coins they're rumored to have.  And if that already sounds nuts to you, buckle up.  Before I go any further, I just wanna note, Ving Rhames is so fucking funny in this movie.  I didn't know Ving Rhames was funny.  I've only ever seen him as a dour, tough guy in movies.  But in this movie, he's kind of a blowhard, jackass type.  And in every scene where Leroy was in danger, I was on the edge of my seat just begging for Leroy to live just a bit longer because he's so much fun to watch in this movie.  Now, I was a little chemically enhanced while watching it, but he was hilarious.  So anyway, they break into the landlord's house with this other guy who sucks, and he immediately dies.  And it turns out that the house is escape-proof, rigged with tons of booby traps, and oh yeah, full of what appears to be monsters.  Turns out the Robesons who own this house are a criminally insane incestuous couple who snatch babies and try to raise them as their own, never allowing them to leave the house, but are also so brutally abusive and demanding that they ended up sending dozens of them to live in the basement forever as cannibalistic troll people.  I thought this movie would be boring.  Oh, and one of their fail sons is living inside the walls in the various cavernous tunnels they're in.  That's Roach, that's his name.  Meet Roach.  They also have a kidnapped daughter named Alice, who to this point has avoided the horror of the basement by strict obedience to her fake parents' crazy demands.  Don't worry though, Alice is chill.  So Fool and company spend about 45 minutes to an hour running around this crazy house.  And at this point I thought, okay, I got this movie figured out.  Turns out, I wasn't paying close enough attention, because at the end of the second act, the movie throws one last twist at you.  Fool escapes the house with enough gold coins to not only pay his rent and support his family, but also to pay for his mother's cancer treatment.  But, to do so, he had to leave Alice behind.  The police, of course, are no help, because the Robisons are rich and white, so the police work for them, naturally.  So Fool goes back into the crazy murder house of his own volition to save Alice and the cannibalistic troll children and his neighborhood.  The movie actually set this up in the tarot reading in the beginning, but I just forgot about that, I guess. ",

            "text": "And just when it seems like Fool is done for, it turns out that before heading back in, he led his neighborhood in a revolution against the Robesons.  They all show up at the end to back him up, and they blow up the house, because, oh also, I forgot to mention this, probably should have mentioned this earlier, the whole house is rigged with dynamite for some reason, and most of the dynamite is in the money pile room, so when the house explodes, all of the stolen money rains down on the neighborhood for them to collect.  And that had to be one of the most satisfying endings to a movie I think I've ever seen.  I adored this movie.  The deranged premise, the ridiculous child logic of these two millionaires literally hoarding gold coins in the basement like Scrooge McDuck.  The performances Everett McGill and Wendy Robey as the characters man and woman respectively are a joy.  I should point out the conspicuous way that these two are based on Ronald and Nancy Reagan.  Like, look at the man's haircut.  Consider the way that he calls his sister wife, mother.  Like how Reagan called his wife, mommy.  Google it.  I didn't make that up.  Mike Pence does this too.  It's fucking weird.  Conservatives are fucked up sexual weirdos.  Consider also the exacting standards they place on their children to live up to their weird demands.  Look at the way they think about guns.  Look at how racist they are and how they associated a white little girl even being near a black little boy to be inherently sexual in nature.  They keep saying that Fool turned Alice into a whore when they're both prepubescent children.  Like, there's nothing at all about their relationship.  that isn't perfectly innocent.  Consider that this guy's name is The Man.  You know, like the man you stick it to.  This movie is of its time, but also really ahead of its time.  The things it was satirizing are still big problems today, and it feels like he could just kind of take the script, put in a few cell phones, and it would feel like it was written last week.  It's not a big surprise to me that Jordan Peele listed this movie as a major influence on his work.  It really shows when you watch it.  The way that the situation starts off with very relatable concerns and gradually spirals into madness, and the combination of humor and scares are very much like the way he structures his movies.  Bottom line, nothing makes me happier than when a movie surprises me.  If The People Under the Stairs has taught me anything, it's that I need to have a more open mind with movies I choose to watch.  I need to be willing to sit down with movies that I'm afraid might be too dry or not exactly what I'm looking for at that moment.  You've never run out of good movies, good books, good media to cram into your noggin.  Who knows what movies I've never watched that turns out might be masterpieces?  Hellraiser Deader?  I Still Know What You Did Last Summer?  Ginger Dead Man vs.  Evil Bong?  Smiley?  Deathbed the Bed That Eats?  I must now watch every movie on Earth on the off chance that one of them is as good as The People Under the Stairs.  Well, that was a YouTube video that you watched.  I hope you enjoyed it.  Please press the like and subscribe buttons here on YouTube.  Ring the little fucking bell.  All of that would help me a lot.  It helps me go up and down in the algorithm.  I don't know how any of it works.  Neither do you.  Nobody does.  Please do those things if you liked the video.  Bye!  Really sold it.  Really convinced people.  it's in their best interests to do.
