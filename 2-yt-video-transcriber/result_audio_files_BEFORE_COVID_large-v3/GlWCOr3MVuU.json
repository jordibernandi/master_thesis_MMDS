But she talked about 25,000 good paying jobs that were lost.  uh she talked about uh massive infrastructure improvements that were lost.  uh the fact that when somebody like amazon comes to your area that that attracts other tech giants.  the opportunities lost there are extraordinary for people as andrew ross sorkin said who don't even understand basic economics.  they actually think you know all that money in tax incentives.  if the jobs were brought in all the other great things happen to that area.  yeah he said there's a financial literacy epidemic in america.  quick lesson new york city wasn't handing cash to amazon.  it was an incentive program based on job creation and how much tax revenue they created.  There is $3 billion that can now be spent on subways or education.  And unfortunately, Donnie, this project was killed by people who didn't understand that and also who ignored over 80% of Latinos in the New York area and 70%... of black Americans in the New York area who needed these jobs, who wanted these jobs.  End of the line, the people who wanted the jobs the least to come to the area were white elites in Manhattan, according to all of the polls. ",

That would be the second most inane move of the day.  You know, this is Joe, and I actually called you yesterday.  I was so out of my mind, my head was exploding.  When you have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who I find extremely dangerous at this point, I hope she doesn't tweet that, who are you, Donny Deutch, I don't care about you or anything, because basically she has a Twitter following, and that's her power base, to basically come out and say, as you pointed out, what a great thing it is.  If we could take that money and give it to teachers, it doesn't exist.  It's an abatement.  $27 billion.  We put down three.  That's business.  That's what happens.  And you attach this to the Green Deal, and you are handing President Trump... President Trump now gets to go, oh, the Democrats don't want jobs.  The Democrats don't want companies coming to your neighborhoods.  The Democrats have a Green Deal that wants a 70% tax rate, that wants jobs for everybody, even if you just hand it to you.  They just, tuition, hand it to you.  Socialism.  We are in a dangerous place, and if people in the party don't start to speak up against people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is young and dynamic, but does not know what she's talking about, and her and her cohorts, some of these new, fresh, progressive faces, are going to hand the presidency ",

The important thing to remember here, though, is there are a lot of local politicians, not a lot, but some local politicians in New York City also opposed to this still.  It's just AOC was the most vocal and was actually cheering, which i do find remarkable.  cheering on twitter the loss of twenty five thousand high-paying jobs that most of the people in her district in most of the people in new york wanted.

Think about what comes out of that.  Think about all the businesses that are built and the people that are hired and the dry cleaners and the restaurants and everything that flows out of 25,000 jobs coming in.  Susan, you've worked in New York City politics for a very long time.  What's your view of this?  And did some of the progressives have a point in some of their protests about what Amazon wanted out of this deal? ",

We are going to lose our influence in Washington during the next redistricting because we'll lose about one to two congressional seats.  Now we're telling business, don't come here.  Just because she has a progressive agenda, which some people like, does not mean she has the city's best interest.  What she showed me today or yesterday is that she only cares about herself, not about her colleagues and Carolyn Maloney, and definitely not about the people she represents because those people would be getting jobs as well.

That would make people's commute from her district and also all around New York a bit easier, a bit less onerous.  The commute is so long and so difficult for so many working class New Yorkers.  It's a real problem.  But again, Mika, this is the sort of thing, again, this is the sort of thing that Again, I found when I first got to Congress, younger members of Congress just didn't know what they didn't know.

And that zeal, that joy, that energy, that new kind of thinking is all great, but you still don't have the experience.  And in this case, it's the political experience.  It's the ham-fistedness of that tweet.  Obviously, the issue was complicated.  Obviously, there was a lot of support for what she was talking about on the local level.  It is always more complicated.  But in politics, it's clear.  And she needs to follow some of the more successful, more mature members.  I would suggest Nancy Pelosi would be a great example.  But you don't know what you don't know.  And you're going to step in it if you're not careful.  And they have a few times.  And I just I watch AOC with a lot of hope. ",
