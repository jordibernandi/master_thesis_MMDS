            "text": "Hey folks, it's Patriot Nurse.  Join me today and we're going to make pain medicine from perfectly legal herbs.  So friends, join me in the kitchen here.  I don't have necessarily the most organized kitchen, but at least it's functional.  I want to show you the herb that I'm using here, and that's mullein.  And I like to use organic when I can.  This is Dr.  Christopher's brand, The Best Botanicals.  Another good brand is Frontier, and Star West Botanicals is still pretty good.  But these are large, bulk sizes of mullein that I purchased, by the way.  And I found that the efficacy as far as pain relief is pretty even between the brands, but what I want to show you is how I'm preparing it.  And hopefully you can see here, A simmering pot of mullein here.  And this is of course the cut stems, leaves, and flowers.  It's all in there together.  The flowers are the best as far as overall content of the properties that give you pain relief.  But the best way to prepare them I found is to make a strong decoction of mullein.  And let me show you over here real quick.  I will show you the book that I recommend here.  This is the Herbal Soul Bliss and also the School of Natural Healing from Dr.  Christopher.  And I'll put a link in the description box below so that way you can score some of those books for yourself.  But that right there is what I'm making as far as herbal medicine.  And basically all that you have to do, friends, is just slow cook this for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour.  And I use the formula that Dr.  Christopher gives in his School of Natural Healing for the Strong Decoction of Mullen.  And I would call it effective overall for pain relief.  And it is also a good nerve food for people who, for instance, have pain that tends to set in later at night.  It can help you sleep through the night pretty well.  So if you've got any questions, of course, you know, run it by your pharmacist or your doctor.  if you're worried about drug interactions because I don't give, I'm not giving pharmacological consults on YouTube.  So I hope that was helpful for y'all and I'll put links to the things that I talked about in the description box below.  If you did enjoy the video, I hope you'll subscribe to me, Patriot Nurse.  You can also support me on Patreon.  Friends, I have a prayer request, if you would please.  I have a friend named Mr.  Eddie who is battling for every breath right now.  He is fighting Lou Gehrig's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS disease.  So if you would lift him up and his family up in your prayers, I'd appreciate that for sure.  I hope it was helpful for y'all.  For now, let's pay your nurse sign off.  See y'all later. ",
