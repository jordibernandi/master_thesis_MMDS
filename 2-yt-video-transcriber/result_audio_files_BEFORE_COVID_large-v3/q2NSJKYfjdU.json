            "text": "Strangely enough, the term incel was first used by a Canadian woman in the 90s on a chat forum where lonely members traded advice on dating and sex.  As time went by, increasingly the chats became hateful and male-dominated, especially thanks to the growth of feminism and its acceptance into the mainstream.  Now, most incels are young men and boys with a history of isolation and rejection, men who over 40 years ago would have been married to a woman with few life options or opportunities.  You see, incel culture is the result of men losing access and entitlement to women's bodies.  Think about it.  For most of America's history, white men especially had unfettered access to women, and for free.  White women of a certain class were expected to marry and fit perfectly into patriarchal expectations of womanhood, pleasing her man sexually and bearing his children.  Marital rape wasn't a crime until 1979, and actually wasn't a crime in all 50 states until 1993.  Chattel slavery granted white men endless opportunities to rape black women, and the mass abuse of indigenous women at the hands of Europeans and their descendants can't be swept under the rug either.  And in the workplace, sexual harassment wasn't taken remotely seriously until the 90s.  That means for most of American history, white men, even those of low erotic and social capital or with little money, had relatively easy access to women's bodies in their time.  To look at the history of incels, a group that has only been around since the late 90s, we must examine the culture of the 20th century that shaped them.  Several events drove men both into the incel ideology and the more dressed up conservatism that exacerbates it, but more on those enablers in a second.  The key component of incel ideology is a sense of entitlement to women.  As I'll discuss in the corresponding podcast episode for this video, wins in the feminist movement had direct impacts on the sexual economy.  When Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique in 1963, it was just one of many shock waves that challenged the status of women in America.  The book contained interviews with white middle-class housewives, many of whom were unhappy with their lives.  As discussed in other intellectual media content, the nuclear family model of patriarchy that required women to be stay-at-home submissives was more of a manufacturing than an American reality.  So women who bought into the notion of being a housewife to fulfill a societal expectation, or because there were no other options, rather than because they truly wished to be homemakers, would go on to channel their restlessness into feminism.  Their efforts were filled with wins and losses, diversity and racism, consensus and disagreement.  Ultimately, the increase in choices available to women at the late 20th century, from being able to be involved in politics or work outside the home, or forego motherhood altogether, to even having better college experiences, meant that children and marriage often took a backseat.  This has only continued into the present, as millennial women are now more likely to get married and have children later than previous generations.  We also can't forget the rights extended to more queer women, meaning women who decades ago would have been more likely to marry men now do not.  But that's not all.  Increasingly, since the late 20th century, there's also been a desire to instill girls with self-esteem.  Jessie Sengal wrote for The Cut on the trend in self-esteem lessons.  If you grew up or raised a child during the 1980s or 1990s, you almost certainly remember this sort of material, as well as goofy classroom exercises focusing on how special each individual child was.  A certain ethos took hold during this time.  It was the job of schools to educate, yes, but also to instill in children a sense of their own specialness and potential.  While these self-esteem lessons were gender neutral, girls of the 90s were also being fed a steady diet of girl power messaging in pop music, television, and other forms of entertainment.  Lately, Angelica's been acting like a real princess.  That's great!  In a male-dominated power structure, she's gotta eat, breathe, drink, and sweat self-esteem.  Take Your Daughter to.  Work.  Day became a popular corporate event meant to inspire during this period.  This was also the same decade that Anita Hill took the stand against Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas and filled the country in on how he sexually harassed and humiliated her.  He wasn't punished for his actions, but the next year, a few more women than usual were elected to Congress, creating the misleading label for 1992 as the year of the woman.  In the years since, dismantling rape culture has been one of the most visible aspects of the feminist movement.  For example, Me Too, coined by Tarana Burke and adopted by everyone, exposed the prevalence of rape culture in various cultures and communities.  Rape itself, though still often trivialized by some, is being taken more seriously than ever before.  The importance of consent, a fundamental blow to rape culture, means men face more rejection despite whatever entitlement they feel to women.  But feminism isn't the only catalyst of incel growth.  Because incels feel entitled to women's bodies, they absolutely hate sex workers, who have only become more emboldened and empowered in recent years thanks to the internet.  In the eyes of incels, not only can they no longer take sex with impunity from women they desire, some women they view as desirable also have the audacity to sell sex when they should just be giving it for free.  Many of the incels rationalize their alleged rejection and isolation from all women as fallout from being irrevocably ugly.  This could be body dysmorphia, a mental disorder in which people exaggerate or obsess over a perceived flaw in their appearance.  It affects about one in 50 people.  But incels could also just be choking on a lot of misogyny, regularly doled out in echo chamber chat rooms of congruent beliefs and egging on.  Love shy was the misogynistic form of choice in the early 2000s for incels, but the culture itself was influenced and shaped by other members of the so-called manosphere, like pickup artists and men's rights activists and their forums.  Pickup artists see women as conquests to be seduced with mental games and methods and prey on lonely men willing to part with their coins for questionable advice in seminars.  Men's rights activists despise feminism and see the wins made by women in the past century, like voting rights, equal pay, reproductive rights, et cetera, as destructive to society.  In these circles, red-pilling is the act of being exposed to the alleged toxicity of feminism and the truth of male-female relations.  Red-pilled men are conservative, worship gender roles, and even advocate for rape or claim that women can't actually be raped.  Black-pilled men, or incels, take it a step further, believing that sexual success is based on looks, and that they are in the bottom of a social hierarchy.  At the top are chads, or 20% of men who are attractive to women.  They believe that 80% of women who are vain and cruel creatures are only interested in chads.  They are referred to as stacys.  In incel chats, where like-minded thoughts are reverberated and duplicated, violence is regularly encouraged.  Elliot Rodger evoked incel ideology in his 141-page manifesto before stabbing and murdering six people in California in 2014.  A Montreal man named Mark Lapine, who marched into a university classroom in 1989 and murdered 14 women and injured another 10, is idolized, and his name has even been retrofitted for usernames.  Other incel murderers, like Christopher Harper Mercer, who killed nine people in Oregon in 2015, are also held in high esteem.  In the incel-related murders reported by the media, the killers expressed congruent themes of rejection by women or not being given what they were allegedly owed sexually.  In the aftermath of the murders of 10 pedestrians in Toronto by a self-proclaimed incel.  in 2018, an economist named Robin Hanson said, one might plausibly argue that those with much less access to sex suffer to a similar degree as those with low income, and might similarly hope to gain from organizing around this identity, to lobby for redistribution along this axis, and to at least implicitly threaten violence if their demands are not met.  Allegedly playing devil's advocate, his entire stance was that maybe incels have a point, that men, who once could easily have their sexual needs met, are getting the short end of the stick in the tidal wave of this whole feminism thing.  He compared men's personal issues obtaining sex with class issues in obtaining wealth.  He implied that they need sex so badly, a highly valuable commodity, that it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable for them to turn to violence to get it.  Women's consent be damned.  If incels wanted sex, they'd want to legalize or decriminalize sex work.  But instead, they want absolute control over women and unfettered access to them.  Social conservatives may not advocate for outright violence against women, but by implying or saying that incel culture would dissipate without feminism and sexual choice, they are reinforcing it.  And violence isn't the only course of action for incels who can harass women in their lives in other ways, making it nearly impossible to measure the true scope of incel activity.  They can post revenge porn, stalk women, verbally harass women, dox their private information to the web, or in the case of sex workers, report them to authorities, set fake appointments to waste their time, steal cam girl content to repost to tube sites, among other things.  A prominent example of incel culture infiltrating the mainstream is GamerGate.  As women have gained increasing visibility and representation in video games, something that has been historically geared towards men, there has been pushback.  Starting in 2014, several prominent women were doxxed, harassed, and threatened by gamer incels.  Men who came to the aid of these women were called social justice warriors, a term regularly used by racists who want to trivialize racial issues.  Speaking of race, an analysis of one of the most popular incel sites found that while 55% of the users are white, the rest are a diverse group of races.  I will address black incels on the podcast, but I do want to close this episode by noting the overlap between incels and white supremacy.  We know that the white man's economic and political dominance is a reflection of systematic racism and sexism, and that he has much to lose from not only minority progression, but from feminism.  It makes perfectly logical sense for white men agonizing over black pride and unrest in chat rooms to fall into a rabbit hole about the damage of interracial dating and civil rights and ending up in a Reddit thread dedicated to hating Chads and Stacys.  But for black incels, what's the appeal?  Find out in episode three of Lex Rated, the podcast. ",
