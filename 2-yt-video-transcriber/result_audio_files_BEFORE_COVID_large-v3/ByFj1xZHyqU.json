When you have the government determining what language is and is not acceptable, That's a very dangerous precedent to set.  Where's the line?  What you find offensive might not be offensive to someone else.  What someone else finds offensive, who may be in power for those four years, may be completely acceptable to you.  Why would you support giving that right over to the government?  Furthermore, most movements, civil rights movements, the LGBT movement, the gay pride movement, these movements have been created by people who would be presumed to be underclass or the oppressed.
