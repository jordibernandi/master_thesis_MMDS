            "text": "Okay boys and girls, this is why I despise YouTube and why I have a hard time making videos sometimes and why I get disenfranchised and demotivated with YouTube.  These videos with a little yellow mark there were monetized when I put them up.  A day or two later, are you dating a pinball girl?  I didn't say in there it was hateful or anything like that.  yet it's now been demonetized.  First taste.  Punch double Corona.  I'm just smoking a cigar talking about what it tastes like.  Demonetized.  Where have I been?  Where have I been?  Talking about what I've been doing, why I haven't been on YouTube?  because I'm confused with the diet and stuff.  Demonetized.  Hang on the deck with Kel.  Demonetized.  And that one, I did ask for a manual review, and it's confirmed that it's not suitable.  This is what I go through on a regular basis on YouTube.  It's just sickening.  I mean, dating a pinball girl.  If I were a woman, I talked in this video about women who break up with you, cheat on you, then they want to come back and be a girlfriend again, then they break up again, they go to some other guy, and they're being pinballed backwards.  If some woman put a video up about men who did that, it would be featured somewhere on YouTube.  But no, I do it about a woman because it's about women and it's demonetized.  Again, first taste, punch, double cone, cigar.  What in the hell is wrong with that?  It's a review of a cigar.  I didn't swear in the video.  I did nothing politically incorrect.  It's just, ah, we're going to demonetize that.  Where have I been?  Talking about, you know, being tired and losing weight and why I haven't been around as much.  They demonetize that.  This happens again and again and again.  And what happens is, by the time if they do monetize it, I've had most of the views I'm going to get, so I'm screwed.  Request review for this one here.  This is the whole process you go through.  You gotta click on it, request manual review, confirm it's suitable for advertising, which it certainly is, and then you request review.  And sometimes you do this and they never review it.  It just sits in limbo forever.  I've gotten, you know, and they've gone through my channel.  I've got over a thousand videos.  They've gone through my channel and done this again.  And I get all videos way back when I made years ago.  They've done this.  These aren't just new videos.  They're doing this too.  They've gone through all my, all my old videos and they just automatically just do this.  They get the thing set this way.  By the time they do, do monetize them.  I've already gotten most of my views anyway, so it doesn't even matter.  It doesn't make a person feel very good about YouTube.  I opened my YouTube creator studio today, by the way, to put up a video.  And what I get is slapped in the face by YouTube.  That's what I got.  That's what I consider this.  A big punch or slap or a big kick in the groin by YouTube.  That's what this is.  They hate their creators.  They hate the people who make YouTube work.  They hate us.  They actually do.  I have no doubt about it.  This is what it tells me.  They despise us and don't want us making videos.  It just pisses me off.  It's demotivating as hell.  It really is.  It's disgusting.  And you get these little trippy videos they make about, oh, let's help the creators.  Oh, we would not help our creators.  Oh, it's so nice.  Oh, we don't help.  No, you don't.  YouTube, you're a bunch of fucking scumbags.  Now, this will be demonetized, and I don't care.  Because I said the F word in it or whatever, I suppose.  I don't know.  I'm sorry for the rap, but I'm pissed.  I'm sick of this.  Every time I go to my YouTube channel to put up a video, this is what I'm faced with.  You know?  I didn't want to be a creator.  I didn't want to be a partner.  They asked me.  They harassed me for almost a year to be a partner before I did.  And I didn't want to do it.  And I did it.  And now I'm dealing with this crap.  Sorry, folks.  I'm pissed off.  This makes me mad.  I'm just so sick of it.  I really am.  I'll tell you what, honestly.  I hope YouTube goes out of business.  I'm sorry, but I do.  I hope it goes out of business and gets resold to somebody who will manage it properly.  I've never seen in my life a business that purposely goes out to destroy their own business.  YouTube lost 70 million.  billion dollars on market cap.  it was revealed here a few months ago and they talked to the the manager of youtube the ceo whatever and he's happy.  oh i'm gonna keep doing this.  i'm gonna keep going after people and and demonetizing videos and banning people.  oh this is the right thing to do.  you know He doesn't deserve to be a manager of anything.  And this business isn't even a business anymore.  It's just a chance for these politically correct scumbags to virtue signal how nice they are, how good they are.  These narcissistic scumbags.  It's disgusting as hell.  Well, I was going to put a different video today, but I'm putting this one up instead.  All right, folks.  Thanks for watching.  Hey, subscribe, please, I guess.  Click the bell.  All that stuff.  And you can check my Patreon below.  That's why I have Patreon, because it's not doing me all the good, really, really, these days.  But that's why I have it, because they're screwing me every chance they get.  Sorry, I'm just pissed off.  I'll talk to you guys later. ",
