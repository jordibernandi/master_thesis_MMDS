I'm out here with Nancy Nathaniel.  We were actually gonna perform a First Amendment audit directly across the street from this location.  When I turned around, I noticed there was a bunch of flags, just like the one here in this corner, so I decided to take a picture of the flag.  When I took the picture of the flag, all the employees here at this location started tripping out.  They started pointing fingers at us.  They started telling on us and everything else.  So we decided to walk across the street and perform the First Amendment audit here first.  You got me fucked up.  We're over there taking pictures.  So what?  So what?  Don't tell me shit.  All right, guys, A.B.  Watchman.  I'm sitting here with Nancy Nathaniel.  And we're out here doing some public photography.  And these guys are acting like there's a... What are you guys doing?  What do you mean, what are we doing?  What are you doing?  Why don't you take a picture of us?  Anything we can see in the public. ",
