            "text": "Bible Answers with Dr.  Al Garza.  All right, welcome back to Bible Answers.  I got an email regarding a question that someone had about the Book of Mormon, Pearl Gate Price, and the Doctrine and Covenants.  Kind of what you see that picture on the screen there.  And the question was in regards to these books, how do we talk to a Mormon?  How do we talk to someone from the Latter-day Saints Church and use these books to show the inconsistencies or contradictions within the books themselves?  So I'm going to... Focus on a few sections in each one showing how each book from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price are inconsistent among themselves.  So the Book of Mormon will say one thing, and then Doctrine and Covenants will say another thing, and then Pearl of Great Price will contradict either one or both.  And then, of course, what does Scripture have to say?  And the two areas I want to briefly touch on, this is something you can bring up.  So if you do talk to a Mormon or someone from the LDS Church, and they have these three books, which they usually always do, or if you have your own copy, which I would suggest definitely get one, because it does help for you to read it for yourself, then you can kind of highlight these areas we're going to touch on.  Two major points.  Now, there are a number of areas I can go to with this within the Mormon doctrine, how inconsistent it is, the contradictions within them, contrary to what the Bible says.  and even within their own writings.  But I want to focus on two main points that are pretty devastating to the church itself as far as doctrine and theology, and contrary to what the Bible teaches.  And that is the idea of the many wives idea in the Book of Mormon versus doctrine and covenants, as well as the multiple gods in Mormonism, the progression of gods, becoming a god, and God from God eternity having other gods out there.  So I want to touch on those two areas.  Briefly, I spent the first 10 years of my ministry and research in apologetics, dealing with Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, pretty much everybody that was contrary to the Christian faith, Unitarians, you know, apostolic to deny the Trinity.  you know, pretty much everybody in the kingdom of the cults and even in some cases the occult.  So the first 10 years, I researched a lot of this in those areas of false religions.  So I do have my own copy of, of course, the Book of Mormon, Doctrine of Covenants, of course, the Pearl of Great Price right here.  All three books, which you see on the screen.  And I have read them.  I have them all tabbed right here, as you can see, all the tabs.  I have read this, highlighted everything in here, read through all the books, spent a lot of time going through these so-called scriptures that the LDS wants you to believe.  But there's a lot of problems within these three books and those two areas we're going to touch on have our great contradictions within themselves as well as against.  what scripture says which we're going to look at uh is what the hebrew bible says and even in the new testament.  so let's take a look here.  the first thing about the wives.  now i made a couple of notes here uh and we're going to look at uh first um mosaic 11 and of course in mosaic 11 starting right off the bat.  It says, King Noah rules in wickedness.  He's living with his wives and concubines and so forth.  But here's what it says.  It says, For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after desires of his own heart.  And he had many wives and concubines.  And he did cause... And he did cause his people to commit sin and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord.  Yea, and they did commit whoredoms of all manner of wickedness.  So, of course, this is talking about how they took many wives and concubines and they caused their people to sin and commit wickedness with this and whoredom.  And part of this was taking wives, uh, which again is, is, is consistent with the scripture saying, you know, when Solomon took over 500 wives and, and, He committed idolatry with them, and God punished them, divided the kingdom.  Again, after the Torah, God had forbidden these things, and even Paul in the New Testament speaks clearly that men should have one wife.  This is the first part, because it seems to be clear here in Mosiah 11 is that having many wives and concubines is against the commandments of God.  And it's abominable and it causes sin and wickedness.  But here's the interesting thing.  If you go to Doctrine and Covenants, and we're going to look at Doctrine and Covenants 132, you're going to see something much different.  Because here, it seems to be, it is contradictory to what was just spoken about.  Verily thus saith the Lord unto my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired in my hand to know and understand, whereas I, the Lord, justified my servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David, and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and  concubines.\".  So it appears that God justified it, allowed it, and justified his servants, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon, as to having many wives.  Even though the Book of Mormon in Hosea 11 says it's abominable in God's sight, it's horrible, it causes sin, wickedness, and yet he goes on to say, again, that they receive these things from God.  Again, you can't have God justifying taking wives and then having it be an abominable wicked sin.  You can't have both.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  Either one is right or one is wrong.  We know what Scripture just says about taking one wife.  God punishes Solomon.  We're supposed to have one wife in the Torah.  It speaks as clearly.  Paul talks about men having only one wife.  God made Adam and Eve in the beginning, as Paul reiterates, of having one wife.  Jesus talks about this.  Even in the Gospels, one wife.  Of course, the divorce decree between a husband and a wife, not wives.  So this is, the scriptures don't, there's no space here, gray area for scriptures.  Why they did, like Abraham before the Torah took wives, yes, Paul answers that in Romans 5.  But the Torah was not yet there.  Sin was not imputed yet.  So they did what they, on their own desires.  It doesn't mean it was right.  When the Torah came, God laid it down.  So God cannot justify something that he calls sin.  And even in the Book of Mormon, wickedness and abominable acts.  You just can't have both.  So you need to decide here.  But justified and abomination in his sight.  clear contradiction.  I haven't had a Mormon, I mean, I've had elders try to answer this, talking about, you know, time frames, but you can't get away from this.  You can't justify one and condemn another of the same sin.  God is not inconsistent like that.  He's consistent where his Torah, his law, his instruction, teachings are consistent throughout the scriptures.  So you can't justify one group and condemn another.  So that's one big issue.  Now, the idea of other gods, this is interesting.  In Alma 11, We have a great question asked and answered, which I, it's, again, we can say it's consistent with what we know from the scripture in some parts.  So in Alma 11, it says, And Zizrom said unto him, Thou sayeth there is a true and living God?  And Amalek said, Yea, there is a true and living God.  Now Zizrom said, Is there more than one God?  Here's the question.  Is there more than one God?  And he answered, No.  So is there more than one God, according to the Book of Mormon in Alma 11?  No.  Well, again, Doctrine and Covenants.  Now, Doctrine of Covenants, of course, is supposed to be a continuous revelation of Joseph Smith, if you're not familiar with that.  It's a continuous revelation where the Pearl of Great Price touches on much of the teachings within the church and the faith of the LDS church.  You can see the introduction of the Pearl of Great Price in the book and read it.  Doctrine of Covenants, continuous revelation.  Of course, the Book of Mormon is supposed to be like another testament of God.  So is there more than one God?  No.  Doctrine of Covenants 121.  Now, let's see if there are gods.  And this is what we're going to get into as well with even within creation.  In 121, verse 28, So it's going to be manifested.  Before it says, is there more than one God in Alma?  No.  according to that which was ordained in the midst of the council of the eternal god of all other gods before this world was that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof when every man shall enter into his eternal presence and into his immortal rest.  So we have a council of gods, eternal God, all other gods, and of course, this is being manifested.  So there is other gods, all other gods.  This is important because we're going to look at the scriptures about other gods and what the Almighty, the God of scripture, what he says about all other gods.  So Here you have one side saying there is gods and it's in a council of God and toward our council of all other gods.  And of course, when the question was asked, is there more than one God?  He said, no.  Well, not according to doctrine of covenants.  So, but again, here's the interesting part.  Because the Mormons believe, or the LDS individuals believe, they can become gods themselves.  They can earn their way to becoming a god.  And there's a progression they need to go through here on earth to hopefully become a god themselves and have their own world.  So here's where this becomes an issue.  Because in Doctrine and Covenants 132, here's where we have something interesting.  Because this is where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we talked about earlier, it refers to them as being them being gods themselves.  It says basically, you can read verse 18, but it's gonna go in there and say, when they were out of the world, they cannot be received there because the angels and the gods are appointed there by whom they cannot pass.  They cannot therefore inherit my glory from my house, the house of order, sayeth the Lord.  This is considering after the afterlife.  There are other gods out there and the gods are appointed there.  So, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the prophets... They're gods.  Now, it says again in verse 37 of Doctrine and Covenants 132, verse 37.  Of course, discussing again the wives.  Abraham received concubines and they bore him children.  It was accounted unto him for righteousness because they were given unto him and he abode in my Torah.  So again, contradicting the abomination of what it said in Mosea.  It says, So, This justifies, in fact, in verse 37, all the way down to 39, it justifies them taking wives.  David also received many wives and concubines, and Solomon, Moses, my servant.  And they did nothing that they, they did not sin in doing so.  And David's wives were given unto him by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others, and the prophets who had keys to this power, and so forth.  And they did, he sinned against me, saved the case.  They didn't sin.  So by taking wives and everything else, they didn't sin doing so.  God gave it to them.  But of course, it's abomination to wickedness when they took wives and they committed sin in the Book of Mormon.  And then, of course, they sit in thrones as gods and gather their exaltation.  So you have one hand saying there are no other gods, but then they have a council of gods, appointed gods, and they became gods themselves.  Abraham and Jacob, they sit in thrones in heaven and the exaltation of being a god.  um okay when we get to the scriptures we're going to see this is impossible from the hebrew of the text.  but interesting enough one big contradiction again this is want to have your cake and eat it too.  in the book of abraham in the prologue price we have this uh illustration.  actually let's go let's go before that let's go to the book of moses.  i believe.  first in the book of moses and chapter two we have this, in the order of creation.  And I, God, say, let there be light, in verse 3.  And I, God, saw the light, and the light was good.  So this is I, God, I, God, I, God, all the way down, verse 11, verse 12, verse 13, verse 14.  I, God, singular God, I, God, I, God.  Continues all the way to chapter 3, and I, God.  When you get to the book of Abraham, and you go to the same creation account, in the book of Abraham, chapter 4, Something is definitely changed here in verse 3.  And they, the gods, said, let there be light.  And they, the gods, comprehend light.  And they, the gods, the gods, the gods, plural, plural, the gods, the gods, all the way down, 18, 19, 21, the gods, the gods.  So now you have the gods, the gods, the gods, all the way to chapter 5.  The gods, the gods, the gods.  Something is definitely not right here.  You cannot have two creation accounts together.  Complete contradiction of God, I God, singular, first person singular, I, God versus the gods.  Again, major problems.  The Hebrew scriptures regarding the gods say, Can't be any clearer.  Where it says in Isaiah 43, 10, This is the Hebrew form of Yetzar, meaning to I did not ordain, I did not form, shape, create any god, Before or will there be after me?  None.  I have not ordained it, commanded it, shaped it, formed it, made it.  Zero.  No God.  You can't get any clearer in the Hebrew.  You can't have God and gods.  Anybody becoming a god.  You can't exalt to Godhood.  The Hebrew is clear just as passage.  You are my witnesses, sayeth the Lord.  Before me there was no God formed.  Lo notzarel.  You cannot have it.  I'm sorry.  It's impossible in the Hebrew to have anybody becoming a God, being commanded or ordained of God.  The Hebrew does not allow it here at all.  So, I mean, it's kind of... It's disheartening to me to see people fall for this type of doctrines and teachings.  And these are what we call in the false religions, man-made centered doctrines of men becoming gods.  You go back through history from the Canaanites to Egypt, the Egyptians, all the way down to Babylonian, the Persians, the Greeks to the Romans.  They all believed they were not just gods on earth and they can do whatever they want and take as many wives as they want and commit all the sin they want, but that when they die, they will be with other gods in the heavens and ruling as gods and such into this exaltation that the Mormons are actually following in this pagan practice.  Throughout history, it's become a pagan practice, and the Mormons have adapted this pagan practice in the LDS Church in these three books.  One book contradicts the other.  Book of Mormon, and there are issues within the Book of Mormon itself, don't get me wrong.  I mean, it makes Jesus the Eternal Father and so forth.  I mean, there's a lot of other stuff in there.  that's very inconsistent.  But these points of the Book of Mormon contradicting Dr.  Comet's Poge Price... Uh, you can't, there's no foundation in that.  The scriptures are clear.  There's only one true God.  The, there's no God formed before after me.  That's an eternal decree in the Hebrew, eternal decree of nothing before me.  There is nothing after me.  I'm it.  This is it.  And there's no gods that are going to be formed, shaped, ordained, or exalted to in, in any sense of the, of the words.  So, We need to be careful with this.  These are the things you can bring up to a Mormon.  or ask about if you have these books.  I've used them.  I hammer on those topics and subjects, and believe me, they don't have very good answers for them.  They try.  I'll come back and get some answers, and they never come back.  But these are areas you need to focus on.  And get these books and read them.  I mean, if your ministry is focusing on the LDS Church and the Joe Witnesses get their materials and read them.  I have books and book loads and articles from the Joe Witnesses and the LDS Church's writings and so forth.  So I know what they believe.  And this goes against the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament.  So again, I hope this helps.  I hope this sheds some light on these three books and the inconsistencies within them.
