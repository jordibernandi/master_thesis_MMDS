            "text": "What's going on, Americans?  Jericho Green here with you once again.  Then President Trump continues to kick Elijah Cummings ass over Baltimore.  Remember, this all started with some of the president's tweets after Elijah Cummings was grilling, I believe, the head of Border Patrol or Homeland Security.  grilling them in the House of Representatives, saying that there were children laying in their own feces and the conditions are so horrible.  And Trump was like, hey, fool, look at your district.  Look where you come from.  There's children and their feces there too.  There's rats and vermin and rodents and roaches and filth and murder and crime and drugs.  Right there where you come from.  Right there where you've been sitting since 1996.  With a higher death toll, a higher homicide rate than countries in fucking Central America.  Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.  You look at those images on TV and you're like, damn, that place sucks.  Well, we have one right here.  He was at a rally last night in Cincinnati, Ohio.  And he was letting them have it as they should.  All these people talking shit, shedding these fake tears about children at the border.  Look at their districts.  Look where they come from.  I posted a video on my Facebook and on my YouTube page from Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens, Brandon Tatum, shout out to B. Tatum.  And this guy goes to these actual neighborhoods in Baltimore.  The president again shined a light on a sore spot, on an open sore, on an open festering sore on the American landscape.  So people were like, shit, Baltimore is so bad, let's go check it out.  So they put somebody on the ground to go in these neighborhoods with the abandoned homes, with the piles of trash, with the crime, with the lack of jobs.  He went down there and talked to people, white people, black people, older people, younger people.  He talked to real working people.  There was a dude he interviewed with a hard hat on and a vest.  It gets no more working class than a man with a hard hat and a vest.  He's talking to people.  He asked them straight up.  Trump said it's rodent infested.  Is there a rodent problem?  And they all said, hell yeah, there's rodents.  There's rats, roaches.  Everyone was like, yep, yep.  Rodents, rats, yep.  There sure is.  I hate to say it, but there sure is.  People in my comment section saying I'm from Baltimore, man.  It sucks.  you want to see a shitty city, I will show you one.  Then the common theme in all of these cities, all these crime-ridden, drug-ridden cities, they're all run by Democrats, have been for decades.  Trump is right.  And why does he care?  Is he going to get the black vote?  Hell no.  We vote for those damn Democrats, 95 to 96%.  He doesn't need our vote to win.  He's doing it because it's the right thing.  He's doing it because it's true.  When did truth become taboo?  When did truth become wrong?  Does the truth still hurt?  Hell yeah, it does.  But it's still the truth.  He doesn't need the black vote.  He's not doing it for that.  despite these hardships, despite the horrors that the Democrat Party has and continues to visit upon black people, we're not going to vote for him, the majority.  And the Democrats claim so much, the left is always telling you they care about people of color and the indigenous people.  Well, what about the indigenous people of Baltimore?  What about the people who were born black?  in Baltimore who've lived there their whole lives, their parents, their grandparents, they're indigenous people as well, and you don't give a shit about them.  And this is a black congressman doing this to black people there.  And of course, not to let an opportunity slip by, not to let a race-based controversy slip by unnoticed.  They called in the general.  They called in the leader.  They called in the special ops of slave catchers.  That's right.  Al Sharptongue.  He says that the president has a certain venom for black people and people of color.  Man, shut your sickly looking ass up.  I've said it before.  Al Sharpton looks like he has hepcades.  That's hepatitis, cancer, and AIDS all together.  You look gross.  Now, did Trump have this venom when you were sitting somewhere with him and Jesse Jackson and you came up and shook his hand?  Did he have the special venom then?  Did he have it when you asked him for favors?  When he donated money?  Did he have that special venom toward black people and other people of color then?  Either you're lying to me or you're a fucking idiot and you didn't notice that you were shaking hands with one of the biggest racists since the Fuhrer.  Which one is it, Al?  Are you dumb or are you lying?  Please check out that video on my Facebook and my YouTube page.  It's crazy.  It looks like a bombed out third world country.  Trash, boarded up buildings.  This shit looks like Chernobyl.  All overgrown, buildings collapsing, trees growing up through old homes.  It looks like nobody's lived there in 30 years.  And that's a major American city.  Yeah, I'm saying it like we're better.  We are.  We're the best country in the world, and we need to act like it, and we need to look like it.  West Baltimore is disgusting.  My mom's from there.  We just had a cousin.  I'm not going to front like.  he was a cousin I was super close with.  I didn't really know him.  I haven't been back there in years, but a couple months ago, he was murdered.  Imagine that.  A black person getting murdered in Baltimore.  That's happened over 300 times over the last few years.  That's damn near a murder a day.  So what have you been doing since 1996?  Where has the money been going?  It is not showing.  It is not looking like a damn dime has come through that city.  At least that part of the city.  So where is all the money?  Like the great poet, Cuba Gooding Jr.  Show me the money.  Where is it going?  If it's not going to the people of Baltimore, if it's not going to the streets of Baltimore, it's going to the pockets of Baltimore's politicians.  Didn't the mayor of Baltimore just get in trouble over some scandal with money and shit?  Corruption.  It's rotten with corruption and lazy ass people who aren't doing shit.  But if somebody else mentions it, look, they're the racists.  Look at what the racists are saying.  Well, I'm starting to think racists aren't as dangerous as you people.  Because racists aren't doing nearly the damage that you're doing to those people.  So let's say they were racists.  I don't give a shit.  They're not hurting me.  You are.  Trump's not done with them yet.  He's still beating that ass.  There's a few more rounds to go.  And I'd like to see if any of these fools open their mouths again talking about these children at the border.  Because you know that Trump is going to hit Twitter and expose your city.  Expose the feces and needles in your streets, San Francisco.  Be careful.  Because that bright light can shine both ways.  Keep your mouth shut.  Fix your damn cities.  And stop trying to get us to take in and pay for the rest of the damn world.  Fucking crooks.  Man, I'm done with this rat race.  I'm about to get home with my beautiful family.  My wife and kids stayed the night somewhere else last night, so I miss them.  It's about to be fun and wrestling on the giant beanbag in the living room.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.  Please subscribe, hit that notification bell, utilize the PayPal link and the Teespring link to get your green gear.  I am Jericho Green.
