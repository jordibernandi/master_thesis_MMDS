The economies in Germany, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and a number of other countries are also showing vulnerabilities, experts say.  The uncertainty is exacerbated by fears of the potential financial fallout that could happen if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in October without first reaching a deal on the terms of its departure.  In particular, developments in Germany are quite troubling.  Their economy actually contracted last quarter and the German government is preparing to embrace new fiscal stimulus measures should its economy stumble into a deep recession.  Nearly two weeks after Der Spiegel sent its first trial balloon about the prospects that the German government might crank up its fiscal stimulus if Europe's largest economy slides into recession, which, as we explained last week, is already on the cusp of doing, The trial balloons across the Atlantic.  Bloomberg reported on Monday that the German government is preparing to embrace new fiscal stimulus measures should its economy stumble into a deep recession, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  Now, we haven't seen talk like this in a very, very long time.  For many people, the extreme pain caused by the economic crisis of 2008-2009 has almost faded from memory.  But the truth is that many experts believe that what is ahead is going to be even worse. ",

At the end of the day, a lot of the power of blockchain is kind of faithfully recording information that you value.  And you want to make that information dynamic.  You want to transfer ownership.  And that's a payment.  And so we believe that this Internet of Value concept, which kind of involves all these applications, really relies on having a strong payments infrastructure under the hood.  The way we inject XRP is at the source exchange.  So in our Bob and Alice example, this is in South Africa, the system you would purchase XRP at the source exchange for using your South African RAND.  The XRP ledger would let you transfer that across borders in just a couple seconds to an exchange in the Philippines where then you could purchase Philippine pesos and send those out.  Why is this better?  The power comes from separating the action of foreign exchange from crossing the border.  So at the source of the destination, you're within a single jurisdiction.  You have regulatory clarity, ideally.  You have kind of simple integration against a single type of payment system.  And that's where you can do your foreign exchange into and out of the digital currency XRP.  Moving it up to the other country, now you have this digital asset.  It doesn't care about borders.  It's open.  Anyone can use it.  It can get to the other side in a matter of seconds where you can kind of reverse and then pay out in the local rails. ",

Any chance that we could have gold actually become a worldwide to actually be the currency used?  I don't think so as long as the U.S.  has authority over it because we don't hold near as much gold as other countries.  That would be terrible for the U.S.  dollar.  If gold were the backing for the world's reserve currency, China is way ahead of us in terms of that.  Libya was way ahead of us in terms of that.  Who knows where their gold is now?

They cut out the central banks, they cut out the banks, and they're ideally directly peer-to-peer between you and I. And so the challenge for payment systems is to move in that direction so we can instantaneously move money from my account to your account to the publican's account, the guy who runs the pub, directly.  And what we're doing at the Bank of England is we're reorganizing the core of the system in a way that allows new payment providers to just plug in.  They could be using distributed ledger technology.  They can use other technologies.  And we're in a position where these innovative so-called PSPs will be able to provide those types of services.

We believe that when nations respect the rights of their neighbors and defend the interests of their people, they can better work together to secure the blessings of safety, prosperity and peace.  Each of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture, a rich history, and a people bound together by ties of memory, tradition and the values that make our homelands like nowhere else on earth.  That is why America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control and domination.  I honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs and traditions.  The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship.  We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return.  From Warsaw to Brussels to Tokyo to Singapore, it has been my highest honor to represent the United States abroad.  I have forged close relationships and friendships and strong partnerships with the leaders of many nations in this room, and our approach has always yielded incredible change.  With support from many countries here today, we have engaged with North Korea to replace the specter of conflict with a bold and new push for peace.  The dreams that fill this hall today are as diverse as the people who have stood at this podium and as varied as the countries represented right here in this body are.  It really is something.  It really is great, great history.  There is India.  A free society over a billion people, successfully lifting countless millions out of poverty and into the middle class.  There is Saudi Arabia, where King Salman and the Crown Prince are pursuing bold new reforms.  There is Israel proudly celebrating its 70th anniversary as a thriving democracy in the Holy Land.  In Poland, the great people are standing up for their independence, their security and their sovereignty.  Many countries are pursuing their own unique visions, building their own hopeful futures and chasing their own wonderful dreams of destiny, of legacy and of a home.  The whole world is richer.  Humanity is better.  because of this beautiful constellation of nations, each very special, each very unique, and each shining brightly in its part of the world.  In each one, we see awesome promise of a people bound together by a shared past and working toward a common future.  As for Americans, we know what kind of future we want for ourselves.  We know what kind of a nation America must always be.  In America, we believe in the majesty of freedom and the dignity of the individual.  We believe in self-government and the rule of law, and we prize the culture that sustains our liberty, a culture built on strong families deep faith, and fierce independence.  We celebrate our heroes, we treasure our traditions, and above all, we love our country.  Inside everyone in this great chamber today, and everyone listening all around the globe, there is the heart of a patriot that feels the same powerful love for your nation, the same intense loyalty to your homeland.  The passion that burns in the hearts of patriots and the souls of nations has inspired reform and revolution, sacrifice and selflessness, scientific breakthroughs, and magnificent works of art.  Our task is not to erase it, but to embrace it.  to build with it, to draw on its ancient wisdom, and to find within it the will to make our nations greater, our regions safer, and the world better, to unleash this incredible potential in our people.  We must defend the foundations that make it all possible.  Sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured, where peace has ever prospered.  And so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all.  When we do, we will find new avenues for cooperation, unfolding before us.  We will find new passion for peacemaking rising within us.  We will find new purpose, new resolve, and new spirit flourishing all around us and making this a more beautiful world in which to live.  So together, let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride.  Let us choose peace and freedom over domination and defeat.  And let us come here to this place to stand for our people and their nations, forever strong, forever sovereign, forever just, and forever thankful for the grace and the goodness and the glory of God.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the nations of the world.  Thank you very much. ",
