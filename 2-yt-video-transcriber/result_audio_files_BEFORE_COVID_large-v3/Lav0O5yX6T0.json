            "text": "Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.  You know, for quite some time there has been something that I've been meaning to discuss with you all.  And yes, it does have something to do with giants, but it has more to do with fallen angels, specifically the ones bound to the Euphrates River.  Now this is very interesting because we have a location.  There is no mistaking the Euphrates River for anything else.  Let me just remind you of the scripture.  Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God.  saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.  Now this is based on a prophetic vision, but there should be no mistaking angels and the river Euphrates.  There is a documentary that was released by L.A.  Marzulli on the Kandahar Giant.  And for those of you who have seen this, there is a short section in there where Marzulli is interviewing a soldier who tells him about the apparently very haunted Haditha Dam at the Euphrates River.  And how the prisoners there would freak out.  How the guards would draw straws to go down there.  So I want to discuss this and see if we can come to a better understanding of why there may be fallen angels locked beneath the earth, perhaps still in another realm.  After all, when it comes to many of these ancient sites, one never knows what lies beneath.  So many of us are very familiar with the verse from Revelation 9 that states four angels were bound at the Euphrates River.  And so before we get to the river I want to discuss who these angels are and why they would be bound there in the first place.  Now, if you were to only read the Bible, then you would have a very difficult time trying to find the answers to those questions because for one, it does not specify who these angels are.  it would really just confuse you anyway because the names of angels change by culture.  so what you end up with are a bunch of names that are really just one angel.  so trying to identify these angels will just end up in speculation.  but i believe you could come close.  i mean if you consider the hierarchy of angels and who is responsible for certain things there are only a certain number of angels of death And there are only a certain number of angels of death who are also fallen angels.  Abaddon or Apollyon, of course, whose name means to destroy.  There is Samael, archangel of death, second sphere, powers, authorities.  Azrael, or sometimes Sariel, angel of death.  And the only other angel I can think of that would be considered a fallen angel, and also an angel of death in rabbinic writings, is Leviathan, who may be female, the male being behemoth.  Now, if we look into the book of Enoch.  It is there where we may gain a better understanding of why these angels may be bound there.  It was all due to the defilement or demoralization of mankind.  In this account, a sizable group of angels fell to earth to live among men, to teach and defile them, many taking human wives.  Of the leading fallen, Sariel is one of them.  So the angels that fell made a huge mess of things.  They were going down and they just wanted to take man with them.  Not all of them fell for the same reasons, however.  Azrael, for example, an angel of death, decided on his own to be an outcast, mainly because his entire choir was outcast and he felt lonely.  He felt that he could better do his job of gatekeeping between heaven and hell as an outcast.  The result and consequences of all this falling to earth, I guess these angels, being immortal, figured that any punishment issued by God, I guess they figured that they would get through the punishment over time.  And the worst thing that could happen is that they would just be destroyed by God, right?  Wrong.  See, there were four angels watching this, Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel, who are all to some degree considered angels of death, but not fallen angels.  Even they couldn't believe the punishment that was dished out.  At one point, God sends Raphael to bind Azazel hand and foot.  open up a hole in the desert and throw him in there, which is in Dudel, which since that time period the name of the place has changed.  Some have a strong feeling that this place is Palestine, which is Israel, which is pretty close to the Euphrates as well.  Enoch had direct communication with Azazel and came with a message or sentence.  And Enoch went and said, Azazel, thou shalt have no peace.  A severe sentence has gone forth against thee to put thee in bonds.  And thou shalt not have toleration nor request granted to thee because of the unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and because of all the works of godlessness and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast shown to men.  Then I went and spoke to them all together, and they were all afraid, and fear and trembling seized them.  And they besought me to draw up a petition for them, that they might find forgiveness and to read their petition in the presence of the Lord of heaven.  For from thenceforward they could not speak with him, nor lift up their eyes to heaven for shame of their sins for which they had been condemned.  Then I wrote out their petition and the prayer in regard to their spirits and their deeds individually and in regard to their request that they should have forgiveness and the length of days.  And I went off and sat down at the waters of Dan, in the land of Dan, to the south of the west of Hermon.  I read their petition till I fell asleep.  And behold, a dream came to me, and visions fell down upon me.  And I saw visions of chastisement, and a voice came bidding me, I to tell it to the sons of heaven, and reprimand them.  And when I awaked, I came unto them, and they were all sitting gathered together, weeping in Abishjel, which is between Lebanon and Sennasir, with their faces covered.  And I recounted before them all the visions which I had seen in sleep, and I began to speak the words of righteousness, and to reprimand the heavenly watchers.  Needless to say, God did not change His mind.  Once it is spoken, it is so.  So them and the others were bound in the valleys of the earth.  Assuming not all in one place either.  And Hadith Adam is one of those places that may indeed be a prison for fallen angels.  There are four nations that are bound to the Euphrates and some believe that these nations represent the four fallen angels bound there.  But it probably means that they hold dominion over regions.  powers and principalities of which according to angel hierarchy are responsible for setting nations against each other.  and if there are the angels responsible for wiping out a third of mankind then this is the area to start it up.  if we start at the persian gulf the euphrates actually divides iraq and iran.  then it runs off to the west right straight through the middle of iraq all the way up into syria.  it flows into lake assad.  then it goes all the way up into turkey into a series of lakes now along the euphrates.  in iraq right before you get to syria's border There is the Haditha Dam Lake along with the dam and hydro plant which has a strong US military presence as well as being one of the largest dams in the world.  Let me tell you what happened.  The dam was built in the late 70s and it was a joint project between Iraq, the Soviet Union, with a price tag of over $800 million.  It was designed to regulate the flow of the Euphrates, as well as provide hydroelectric energy and irrigation to the region.  Consequently, the completed construction caused the flooding of at least two ancient archaeological sites in the early 80s.  So in 91, we have Saddam Hussein and Operation Desert Storm.  where he flooded the Persian Gulf with oil.  After that, the US began to look at Iraqi infrastructure to find possible destruction targets.  that if destroyed would devastate the economy and land sending the nation into chaos and the haditha dam was one of those possible targets.  the U.S.  suspected Saddam of developing nuclear weapons and wanted to do a sweep of mostly the western region of Iraq.  I mean they set up a special forces unit.  you wouldn't believe they didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.  but in the process of all that they would take control of a number of targets and at the end they wanted two main targets the Ramadi Highway and the Haditha Dam which was guarded beyond belief.  I'm talking multiple tanks missile launchers the works.  But that didn't stop the US.  And they invaded the dam in a night assault.  And this team of rangers, very proficient at what they do by the way, seized the dam.  And the rest is history.  So as you can see, there is already a ton of negative energy and death surrounding this area.  You can only imagine the amount.  The Haditha Dam is now by all means a U.S.  military facility or base.  And you know when they take something, they're keeping it.  How many of you have heard of the Haditha Massacre?  There are stories along the Euphrates River of strange phenomenon reported by soldiers.  Mostly ghostly phenomenon UFO sightings, but this is a place that may have been where man originated and where the first murder occurred.  Since then the blood that has spilled on the land is unfathomable.  Not to mention it is the ancient site of Babylon.  There are stories of soldiers encountering possessed Iraqis.  There is no doubt in my mind that this place is teeming with spirits of all sorts.  Now one of the most interesting things I find about this dam is what is present in the lower levels.  And Marines who have been stationed there, it was the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Marine Regiment that occupied the dam some time ago and they provided a pretty good description of the place.  The base itself is located inside the dam, where long hallways and corridors were converted to living quarters and eating areas.  They put in a gym and a chapel.  In other large rooms of concrete there are transformers and high voltage lines, along with some other equipment as the hydroelectric power is still a major function of the dam, delivering energy to some 25 million people.  It's almost exactly like being on a ship.  You've got all the stairwells.  There's the constant humming from the turbines.  The water all around, said Staff Sergeant Thomas Watson.  They said they got plenty of exercise running the stairwells of the dam, which has 11 levels above ground that have ceilings of different heights, and the elevators didn't work, so according to First Lieutenant James Crabtree, It's definitely a workout.  Crabtree also stated, the spaces get wider as you get toward the base of the dam.  There are three levels below ground, but they're off limits to us.  There are signs throughout the facility instructing Marines of what to do in emergencies or an attack.  Now, according to some of the plant workers there, Saddam once used the facility as a private resort hotel with rooms overlooking the water.  And I can tell you that anyone staying there must have had a hell of a vacation.  They said there were constant mortar attacks around the dam almost every week, causing the base to shake.  Windows had to be taped up to prevent shattering in case of a nearby explosion.  At the time, the facility was falling apart.  The plumbing, the infrastructure, everything.  Rodent infestation, you know, your typical haunted building.  Now, there is a place, folks, that is in Turkey.  A place that is reported to be haunted.  People have gone missing there, and there are UFO sightings there as well.  And this place is known as Pluto's Gate to Hell.  A place that also releases strange gases.  More on that place later.  And the reason I bring this up is because of the gases that may be at the bottom of the Haditha Dam as well.  The soldiers there said that the dam experiences occasional power outages.  The humming stops.  The engines shut down and everything goes black.  The soldiers also report of a distinct odor, a horrible smell coming from the underground levels, a smell that seeps all the way up to the upper levels.  They have never been able to figure out what the smell is, but like most of the Marines who were stationed there, they have a pretty good idea, stating, we're living right on top of the gates of hell.
