            "text": "Alright, chances are if you're watching this video, you're probably new to my channel and you clicked on this video because PewDiePie is in the title and I am criticizing PewDiePie.  Now before you leave your dislike, I want you to hear me out here.  Please, watch the whole video before you leave the dislike.  So, PewDiePie has had a lot of drama for the last few years surrounding white nationalism, racism, neo-Nazism, all that.  It all started, if I recall correctly, back in October of 2017 when PewDiePie was streaming some PUBG and he The N-word that was heard around the world happened.  PewDiePie was on a bridge in PUBG.  He hit a guy like six times with his fucking M4, if I remember correctly, and the guy didn't go down.  Finished his friend.  He had a heated gamer moment.  He dropped the N-word.  Most gamers, most people, me as well, it was 2017, Chad, defended PewDiePie.  I defended PewDiePie as well.  little while after that and a lot of mainstream news articles like pick this up because i mean if the biggest youtuber on the fucking website says the n-word on stream pretty big deal.  but I, at the time, was a chud, and I also didn't care all that much about the situation.  I was like, you know, clearly he does probably say the N-word in private.  Like, listen, he said the N-word.  Like, he dropped that N-bomb.  Like, it was an insult.  He didn't even realize he said it for a second.  Like, he said, what a fucking gamer.  Oh, shit.  I'm so sorry.  Like, what the fuck?  Like, it took him a second to realize what he had just said.  So that tells me.  He probably says it or said it a lot in his free time, like as an insult with his buddies, which on its own, I didn't see as a big deal.  All right.  But a lot of news articles like pick this up and we're saying PewDiePie is racist or at least saying that PewDiePie said a racial slur on stream.  From there, a little bit more drama went down.  PewDiePie did a video showing off Fiverr.  Now, PewDiePie claimed the point of this video was to demonstrate the crazy shit people online would do for money.  So he paid these two dudes, I think they were like two Indian dudes or something, I don't remember.  He paid them to hold up a sign that said, gas all Jews or gas the Jews or something, and like dance around on screen.  That's what he paid them for.  It was a dumb meme.  That's what I saw it as.  Just a dumb fucking meme.  Or his death to all Jews.  Yeah, not gas to Jews, his death to all Jews.  Yeah, it was a dumb meme.  But once again, people took it as just a dumb meme.  It was a joke.  He apologized for it.  Everyone moved on.  Then more things started to stack up because the alt-right is... The alt-right is a problem in the way that they act.  The alt-right has an interesting tactic where they will appropriate symbols and memes that are popular with normies in order to make the people in their movement who dog whistle those memes to muddy the water.  so it's harder to point them out, right?  And that's what they'll do.  So they did this with Pepe, although we've sort of reappropriated Pepe.  If you're watching this video right now, you can see there's quite a few of them in my chat.  There's one right here.  There is a Pepe right there.  Like, yeah, there's quite a few of them.  Oh, look, there's a Pepe right there.  Look at him.  Look at all those Pepes.  Look at all of them, guys.  That's a lot of Pepes right there.  So we've reappropriated the Pepe, but the Nazis kind of took them.  They started using them.  So that was a problem.  And they did the same thing with the OK symbol.  There's been a lot of memes they've done this with.  However, there is a new meme that was created on poll specifically about like white nationalism.  Like it's a Nazi meme.  It's very clearly meant to be PewDiePie.  That's right, guys.  We're talking about the Aryan Nordic gamer meme today.  Now, PewDiePie did make a video about it, like, a month ago.  There's no point in going over the video.  PewDiePie does not acknowledge the history of the meme or its origin or what it's used for by white nationalists at all.  He just makes a joke about how his likeness was being used for the meme, and that's it, basically.  He absolved himself of all responsibility with this.  Unfortunately, Nazis, regardless of PewDiePie's political affiliation, because PewDiePie is very unwilling to take any hardline stance against Nazis or anything or the white nationalists in his community, he will not take a hardline stance of it.  He'll just sort of like... Just pretend they don't exist so that technically he can keep getting their support.  I mean, the Nazis think he's their guy.  That's what they call him.  He's forward slash or, yeah, no, backslash their guy.  Backslash.  That's like the meme, right?  I mean, like, Stormfront, like, the number one Nazi publication on the website believes that PewDiePie is one of them.  And is their guy.  Like, regardless of PewDiePie's position, they think he's a Nazi.  Which sucks, because I don't think PewDiePie's a Nazi.  I personally don't.  But he just isn't willing to speak out against them in the way that it needs to happen.  He just won't do it.  So.  What are we gonna do about this, guys?  What are we gonna do about the fact that PewDiePie is being supported by fucking Nazis?  Well... There's nothing, really.  All we can do is keep calling it out and hope that figures who are bread-pilled that are friends with PewDiePie continue to gain popularity.  Maybe somebody like, I don't know, Jacksepticeye could convince him to do it, because Jacksepticeye is pretty left-leaning.  That would be nice to see.  It would be nice if, in the future, to have PewDiePie acknowledge this.  But regardless, let's take a look at some of the memes that PewDiePie is being used for, because it is clearly PewDiePie.  I mean, like... It's clearly supposed to be PewDiePie.  Are you shitting me here?  It's not subtle.  The people who made the meme on poll weren't being subtle.  So, okay, we're gonna go over some of the other meme ones here, but first we have one.  Right here, of the coomer and the thought saying, so you two are really just going to pursue a normal and healthy sex life built on love, mutual respect, and a genuine desire to see your partner happy?  And then it's like, the trad wife and Aryan gamer, you know, it's very clearly meant to be PewDiePie with the beard.  Just says yes.  That's just the response.  Just yes.  Well, shit.  All right.  Let's keep going then.  Holy fuck.  God, we're about to hit 400 viewers.  You guys are insane.  All right.  So this one isn't on surface level, doesn't look like any Nazi shit, might just be like a somewhat harmless incel meme.  The problem is, if you guys are aware of the JEQ, the Jewish question, there's basically a conspiracy that the Jews are trying to push... sexual deviancy in media to try to break apart the white aryan nuclear family.  this is a very common white nationalist or neo-nazi um conspiracy theory.  so that's clearly what this is a reference to.  that's where the kumer and thought meme comes from.  so there's that.  then there's this one.  at least they give him blonde hair in this one.  but um yeah I'm going to shrink myself a little bit so you can see it a little better.  That is a skull mask.  That is a very clearly racist caricature of a black person that I'm not going to read because I don't want to get banned from Twitch.  With a literal skull mask PewDiePie.  I think you guys are getting the problem here.  That's pretty fucking yikes.  All right.  The problem is, now thankfully lefties or just non-racists or normies, whatever you want to say, have come along and they're starting to reappropriate the meme into like non-racist memes.  Like here's one that's like about boomers.  I actually kind of like this meme quite a lot.  Um, the zoomer is like, you ruined the housing market, the job market, and the environment, which is true.  And then the boomer with like the I heart Florida fucking visor and the camper in Florida with the Hawaiian shirt just saying yes.  Like, I think it's very clearly this one's meant to be satirical.  Um, like, listen, I live in Florida.  This meme is really fucking accurate.  that's me in 15 years.  15 years what the fuck i'm 20 i'll be i'll be 35. you think this is gonna be me when i'm 35?  actually you know with the beard yeah maybe it might be me when i'm 35. fuck um i don't know.  guys this is a little fucked up.  i feel like there's a problem here.  like A literal neo-Nazi, before shooting up a mosque, yells, subscribe to Pew- well, he didn't yell, he just says, alright lads, remember, subscribe to PewDiePie, before murdering 50 Muslim people.  Like, the fuck?  I feel like at this point, oh yeah, and then also the, um, oh yeah, there was also the San Diego shooter, who also, um, gave PewDiePie a bit of a shoutout in his manifesto before murdering a bunch of Jews.  Like- Regardless of whether or not PewDiePie is a Nazi, which I don't think he is, it does seem weird that he's so unwilling to just acknowledge the issue, right?  He did a tweet, which is something at least, but it's getting worse.  The problem is with these groups, when you have literal Nazis in your community, festering, if you don't acknowledge them, they're like a virus.  They're like a fungus, right?  Like, let's say you have some sort of fungal infection somewhere in your body, right?  And... You don't do anything about it.  You don't treat it.  It's only going to get worse.  Leaving it alone and letting it fester doesn't make it any better.  It's only going to get worse.  And that's what PewDiePie is doing right now.  He thinks that if he ignores them and he cuts them off and gives them no attention, then maybe they'll just go away.  Not how it works.  From the Nazis' point of view... Him ignoring them is a good thing and a good sign because if he didn't like them, obviously he would confront them, right?  But he's not because he can't come out in support of them because that would be, you know, social suicide for, you know, all the normies would leave him, right?  You know, all the normies, right?  But if he ignores them and he knows they exist, then that must be some sort of, you know, passive acceptance of their ideology, right?  That seems to be the implication.  It's interesting.  I feel like because PewDiePie is becoming so popular with Nazis, and he is, he's getting more popular with them, do you think we're going to see more Nazis shooting up mosques, burning down buildings, committing murders, and writing manifestos, and referencing PewDiePie?  How many more times can it happen?  It's already happened twice, at least twice.  How many more times can this happen before PewDiePie realizes?  How many more Stormfront articles can there be talking about how PewDiePie's face is going to be the one on the billboards when they're gassing the Jews?  How many more articles like that can there be before PewDiePie finally disavows all of it strongly?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  There's so many examples too.  It's very possible.  PewDiePie is a reactionary as well.  He's a fan of the quartering.  The quartering just like a month ago was tweeting.  Holy fuck, we're about to hit 400 viewers.  The quartering was tweeting a couple, like two months ago, how happy he was because the PewDiePie was in his chat.  PewDiePie was like in his stream chat saying what a big fan of the quartering he is.  So that kind of fucking sucks.  Being a fan of the quartering doesn't make you a Nazi, but it is a bit of like, it is a bit yikes, I will say.  And it sucks.  It fucking sucks.  It really does.  It really does suck that the biggest streamer or the biggest YouTuber on the fucking planet, the biggest singular person on this fucking planet.  Also, he was following like Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern on Twitter.  That's a bit yikes as well.  It does suck that there is a non-zero percent chance that the largest public figure on YouTube might be a Nazi.  I'm not saying he is, but it is a non-zero chance that he's a Nazi.  It is a non-zero chance.  We just hit 400 viewers.  Holy fuck.  He's probably somewhat reactionary.  I would argue that socially, he's probably fairly progressive.  He's probably pretty progressive socially.  But at the same time, yeah, he also had Ben Shapiro on for meme review and shilled Jordan Peterson's book.  Like, even if you're like the most milquetoast centrist person, you have to agree that there is a non-zero percent chance that PewDiePie is a crypto fascist.  It's possible.  I don't want him to be.  I don't want this to be a case where it's like, oh, he ends up Sieg Heil-ing in a video.  PewDiePie uploads a video tomorrow, and it's just him full-on just coming out as a Nazi.  If that happened, I would be mad.  I would be upset.  I would not be happy.  I don't want to be proven right on this.  This is not a scenario where I want to be like, ha, to like all the centrist liberal people who've been defending PewDiePie all these years.  I don't want to be able to say, ha, told you so to those people.  I don't want that to happen.  I don't want the number one sub-YouTuber on this fucking platform to actually be a Nazi.  I don't want to be right on this.  I want PewDiePie to just be somewhat disaffected and not aware of what's going on.  This is the ideal situation.  PewDiePie is just disaffected, doesn't know what's going on, and... tried to avoid the problem because he thought it would go away.  but when he realizes that it that it's not going to go away he speaks out against it and we're all good.  that's what i want to happen.  that is the best case scenario and that is what i'm hoping for.  he just does that to appeal to his nazi fan base to make more money.  i don't know.  listen anarcho tv.  pewdiepie is a multi-millionaire possibly in the tens of millions of dollars already saved up.  he's been the number one most subbed youtuber on this platform for Over half a decade.  I really think that if he has some amount of, um... If he has some amount of integrity to him, which I think he probably does, he isn't doing it for money.  I don't think money would be why he's ignoring the problem.  I think it's to avoid controversy.  Because if he makes some video tomorrow, let's say tomorrow he makes a video that's just denouncing the Nazis in his fanbase.  I would love it.  That would be awesome.  I would be so fucking happy.  However, it would bring up a lot of drama that would be... disadvantageous for his reputation.  right a lot of centrist liberal gamer bros would probably accuse him of being an sjw.  that would be a big one.  not only that but um we would also see.  uh like people like um like the like the the reactionary as anti-sjw community would also call him out for it too keemstar would.  yeah pewdiepie is a keemstar supporter which is also pretty fucking yikes but I don't know.  It would feel like a punch in the gut if PewDiePie came out as a Nazi.  But I don't know.  We're back in the prime time of year for BreadTube.  We're in January.  So January to May is BreadTube's season.  So we're back in that.  That's why we're 400 viewers right now, which is very nice.  But I'm excited to see where this goes from here.  I want to see if during BreadTube season, PewDiePie does some shit when he has so many eyes on him.  If he does some shit that ends up standing out.  We'll find out. ",
