            "text": "Hey there internet, my name's Luxander and today we are going to be discussing the question of do you need dysphoria in order to be trans?  This video has been a little bit more difficult for me to produce than most because it is very heavily sourced.  You'll find all of the references and citations in the description.  I'm going to put them in the order in which I am mentioning them.  The main organizations that I'm going to be referencing are the American Psychiatric Association and the NCTE, the National Center for Transgender Equality.  So honestly, if you have any major problems with any of the things that I'm going to be saying here, I would go ahead and write a letter to the APA.  I do want to give a brief disclaimer before I get started.  I personally am a trans person who has dysphoria.  It waxes and wanes, sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not, but I do have it, and it was the main thing that I pointed to at the beginning of understanding that I was trans as, like, proof that I am trans.  So I am not in any way an expert on what it is like to be a trans person who discovers that about themselves in the absence of experiencing dysphoria.  I'm just here to collect information and distill it down into one source for people.  I will be defining dysphoria here in a second, but I just wanted to acknowledge that most of the time it's broken down into like two different segments.  You have social dysphoria, which is how you feel when people address you in a gendered manner.  And then there's body dysphoria, which is how you feel about your body and how that is congruent or not with your gender.  It seems to me that most of the time when there are trans people saying, you need dysphoria to be trans, they're saying that you need that physical dysphoria, less so the social aspects.  Without further ado, let's get started on all of these citations.  We're going to begin with the American Psychiatric Association's page on what is gender dysphoria.  Gender dysphoria involves a conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which they identify.  People with gender dysphoria may be very uncomfortable with the gender they were assigned, sometimes described as being uncomfortable with their body or being uncomfortable with the expected roles of their assigned gender.  This is just me quoting straight off the page, I should have a screenshot over here for you.  This page also notes that gender dysphoria is not the same as gender nonconformity.  And further down the page, it shows the DSM diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.  when you go to transition physically, medically, you get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.  You are not diagnosed as transgender.  And the diagnosis of gender dysphoria does require some amount of distress or problem functioning as a result of the incongruence between your internal gender and your assigned sex.  Now that we've defined gender dysphoria, I want to look at this other page on the APA website that is Expert Q&A on Gender Dysphoria.  The first question that they address on this page is, what is the difference between transgender and transsexual?  And here it says, transgender is a non-medical term that has been used increasingly since the 1990s as an umbrella term describing individuals whose gender identity or gender expression differs from the sex or gender to which they were assigned at birth.  I don't think the wording of that is exactly perfect as they say, or gender expression, and I would say that if you only have a gender expression different from your assigned gender, then that's more gender nonconforming.  But the previous page did make a distinction between gender dysphoria and gender nonconformity.  It goes on to say, some people who use this term do not consider themselves as matching a binary gender category.  And they go on to acknowledge new terms such as genderqueer, bigender, and agender.  The next question that they're answering on this page is, is there a general age that people realize they are transgender or experience gender dysphoria?  The very first thing that the APA says in this answer is, not all transgender people suffer from gender dysphoria, and that distinction is important to keep in mind.  So here we have the APA explicitly stating that the word transgender is a non-medical term, they acknowledge non-binary gender, and go on to say that gender dysphoria is not a requirement for being transgender.  Most of the rest of this video flows from these points, so again, if you have any serious issues with that, you should write to the APA.  And don't spam my comments with hateful stuff.  Next, I want to look at the National Center for Transgender Equality's website.  They have a page that's frequently asked questions about transgender people.  This whole page is really an amazing resource.  I'm just going to be picking out a couple of things that I wanted to specifically mention to address this topic.  The first question on the page is, what does it mean to be transgender?  And it starts by saying, transgender people are people whose gender identity is different from the gender they were thought to be at birth.  Trans is often used as shorthand for transgender.  So right off the bat, it says nothing about needing to have gender dysphoria.  It's explicitly, the word transgender means you have a gender different from the one that you were assigned at birth.  Further on down the page, they are answering the question, what is gender dysphoria?  And here it reads, For some transgender people, the difference between the gender they are thought to be at birth and the gender they know themselves to be can lead to serious emotional distress that affects their health and everyday lives if not addressed.  So now we have two organizations, the APA and this activist organization, NCTE, who are both in agreement that you don't have to have gender dysphoria in order to be a transgender person.  One of these is an identity label and the other one is a medical diagnosis.  Now I want to move away from the sort of dry explanations by these organizations and look at a couple of articles written by trans people about gender dysphoria and whether you need it to be trans.  Because part of the point of making this video for me is that I don't think it's good, I think it's actually pretty actively harmful to the community and to the individuals within it to hold this extremely firm stance against people who don't have gender dysphoria.  The first article I want to look at is one on the website Everyday Feminism and it's called Not All Transgender People Have Dysphoria and Here Are Six Reasons Why That Matters.  It was written by Sam Dillon Finch.  He opens up by describing a conversation he had with a fellow trans person in which they were beginning to discuss dysphoria and the friend became very uncomfortable and a little bit reticent to speak on the subject because they don't have dysphoria and they had bad experiences with discussing this with trans people previously.  Sam describes feeling a little bit defensive and then goes into a little bit of introspection on why his original feeling of defensiveness wasn't the right one to have.  He does break this down into six things, I'm only gonna talk about four of the points.  Point number one is it suggests that gender identity is for outsiders to decide.  He says, when we allow other people to make the rules, we strip away the rights of trans people to self identify.  If we tell trans people that their identities don't belong to them, we uphold a culture where the naming of gender identities belongs to outsiders instead of ourselves.  He goes on to say, when I started to doubt my friend's transness, what I was saying to them was, you say that you're transgender, but I don't recognize that or believe that.  I was saying that I knew their gender better than they did.  Yikes.  I agree on this point wholeheartedly, I think that you should be listening to people when they tell you who they are rather than putting a bunch of steps in the way to say like, oh, you're not allowed to participate unless you have had XYZ experience.  It's not a very diverse way of looking at the experience of being trans.  The second point he brings up is that it medicalizes the experience of being transgender.  He essentially posits that the medical model is disempowering to trans people.  He says, And if we give the medical establishment too much control over identifying us as trans, we end up with situations like in Japan, where you're required to be sterilized, you are required to have bottom surgery in order to change your gender marker.  I hope that most of us would agree that that's not a positive thing, and that we shouldn't say, like, you have to have every available hormone and surgery done to you before you're allowed to be who you are.  I agree that that's not a very helpful framework.  The third point is it's a Eurocentric definition of transgender.  Essentially, there are other cultures in the world where people experience something like what we would call being trans, but it's not operating within this Western framework that we have created and brought with us.  Frankly, I don't know enough about this to make a very big point on it, and I don't think it's right for me to appropriate the experiences of people from other cultures in order to make my point.  The fourth point and the last one from this article that I will be discussing today is, it equates being trans with distress and dysfunction.  Essentially in this section, Sam is discussing the fact that being dysphoric and having that pain is not the only thing or even the main thing that defines his experience as being trans.  He says, I want to live in a world where transgender doesn't equate to pain and suffering because ultimately the pain we feel is not what unites us.  It's the identity we claim and the unique journey we each took to find it.  And jumping off from this point that dysphoria and pain shouldn't be the markers by which we determine who's trans, I found this article in The Advocate written by Jessie Earl about two months ago actually.  She writes, to many being transgender has brought them nothing but pain.  Dysphoria is the only way they relate to being transgender.  Yet, she continues, we cannot let dysphoria be the only path, the price of entry into our community.  It frames being transgender as something painful, shameful, and to be resented.  It defines transgender not as something to be proud of, but to be fought against or hide.  Slightly further down the page, she says, I honestly couldn't agree more.  I think that we should have a view of transness as something wonderful and to be celebrated.  She reflects some of the same discomfort that Sam expressed in the beginning of his article.  She says, as I stated before, this very concept seems insulting to so many transgender people who do suffer dysphoria because they haven't gone through the rite of passage.  that is the anguish that many suffer when learning that one is transgender.  I think that this is a lot of where the resistance is coming from.  For a lot of us, it was such a painful process to realize that we were trans because it involved hating our bodies and hating the way that people interacted with us.  But I don't think it's right to set that as the litmus, that's the line that you have to get to in order to be allowed in the trans community.  We should want to make it easier for people in the future, not make it harder for them.  We should want them to be happy in this process of self-acceptance and not suffer through it.  Just because we had it hard doesn't mean that the next generation should have it hard.  And I want to point out that we are seeing a lot more acceptance of trans kids.  If we have more trans kids realizing that they are trans before puberty, if they go on puberty blockers and then go on to the correct hormones through puberty, we might have an entire generation of trans people who never even knew what dysphoria was.  I think that's a really good goal.  I think that we should want that.  We should want the next generation to grow up not even beginning to understand what that pain feels like.  If you went through that pain, I really hope that you don't think that it should be required that children should have to suffer like that when we can prevent it entirely.  And lastly, I want to take a quick look at an article written on the website Gender Analysis by Zinnia Jones.  The article is called, Do You Need to Have Gender Dysphoria to Be Transgender?  She opens by pointing out that this is a question that comes up frequently on the internet.  She says, Most commonly, a person feels strongly that they are indeed transgender for various reasons, but worries that their apparent lack of dysphoric feelings means that they aren't really trans.  This process of questioning can also be complicated by trolls across the internet who seem to believe they need to protect the very concept of transness by keeping out so-called transtrenders who don't meet some particular criterion.  Zinnia has an interesting experience of transition in which she didn't think she had dysphoria, but decided to try hormones anyway.  She describes feelings of derealization, depersonalization, sort of a flatness of emotion, which she didn't recognize could be gender dysphoria.  From her other articles, I know that she was seeing medical professionals through this time, and her symptoms of depersonalization and derealization went away within about two weeks of starting hormones.  In this article, she describes why she decided to start hormones even though she didn't think she had gender dysphoria, and she ends that section by saying, To be clear on the degree of commitment here, if you decide you don't like HRT, you can easily stop after a month or two with little or no permanent changes.  To me, this was at least worth trying.  In her final subsection here called Considerations Other Than Dysphoria, she says, Not every trans person feels a strong, clear aversive and negative feeling toward their body and its features.  For those who don't experience this but still identify more closely with a gender other than the one they were assigned, there are plenty of other ways to clarify what you want out of gender in your life.  And she lists a couple questions you can ask yourself if you are going through that process for yourself.  In her closing paragraph, she says, Being transgender doesn't always mean experiencing a vivid repulsion about aspects of your body and gender.  It can also reveal itself as simply having more positive feelings toward the idea of living as another gender.  Ultimately, this isn't about who does or doesn't fall within a given definition of transgender.  This is about which choices are best for an individual as they navigate gender and its roles in their life.  So that was kind of a lot to get through.  If you stayed with me this far, I really appreciate it.  If you're a person who does believe that you have to have dysphoria in order to identify as trans or be part of the trans community, I hope that these resources helped sort of elucidate things for you, even if it didn't change your mind.  And I really do hope that you check out all of these resources.  I have all of the links down below.  All of them are very, very good information.  It's good to have the sort of clinical explanations from the organizations and then have more personal reflections in the other three articles that I mentioned.  Ultimately, I don't think that it's up to anyone to say someone else is or isn't trans.  I think that this is something very personal.  If an individual tells you who they are, you kind of have no choice but to believe them, unless you think that you're a greater authority over their life experience than they are.  And if you feel like you don't think a cis person should say whether or not you're really trans, I hope that you take that reflection on how you treat other self-identified trans people who don't have dysphoria.  And if you are a trans person who doesn't experience dysphoria, just know that I have your back, and so does the APA and the NCTE.  That's gonna be all from me today, though.  If you liked this video, please give me pretty pretty analytics to look at and comments to read.  As of uploading this video, comments are going to be allowed, but if things get too acrimonious down there, I will have to shut things down.  This is a channel where I check the comments, and if it's a whole bunch of negativity, that is going to impact my mental health.  And again, if you have very significant problems, I would suggest that you address them to the APA.  Subscribe to this channel, ring the bell for notifications, check me out on Patreon if you feel like it, and I really, really, really hope that you have an okay day.  Bye!  Oh god, I'm so tired.
