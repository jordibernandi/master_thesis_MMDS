            "text": "White people have a priority.  Like in the system of white supremacy, white people are trained or taught at an early age to have a priority.  And that is to support the system of white supremacy.  That's what they are taught.  And the victims of white supremacy are taught, if they are taught by white people in the system of white supremacy, to support the system of white supremacy.  So this is why you have white supremacy worldwide in all nine areas of activity.  Economics, education, entertainment, labor, law, politics, religion, sex, and war.  White supremacy in all of these areas of activity.  And everybody has talked this.  both white and non-white, directly and indirectly.  That's what white supremacy means.  So black people among themselves, as prisoners of war, teach each other.  But most prisoners, or most people who are just about to start being prisoners, do.  They do little petty stuff.  You look forward to doing petty stuff.  Petty stuff like what?  Impressing each other.  That's what prisoners do.  If you go to a prison, you see the prisoners all day long trying to impress each other.  Impress each other how?  By playing little kid games, marbles, cards.  bingo, a fight in the cell block.  I mean, that's entertainment.  I mean, that's something to do in the prison.  Start a fight.  I mean, and then look forward to starting the next fight and getting back at the next people in the next cell block.  Why?  Because you're in a prison, and this is the nature of a prison camp.  People have a tendency to do this over a long period of time.  They can't make any grandiose plans.  Plans to do what?  I mean, they're never, you know, they're doing a life sentence.  This is a life sentence in the system of white supremacy.  There's no such thing as parole.  There's no such thing as a pardon.  in the system of white supremacy.  So we do little small things and make big things out of small things.  And I'd just like to look at the things that I'll say here in 2018.  What does the average black male I know in the, I would say, speculate in the Northwestern Hemisphere think about?  doing most of the time or make plans as a young black person.  What does he or she look forward to?  Just about two or three things, just a very short list.  And what is it?  All right.  Savage black male walking around in the northwestern hemisphere in what we call the United States.  walks around thinking about, maybe he's about 16, 17 years old or thereabouts, give or take a few years, basketball player.  All right?  That's correct.  The black person with the bouncing basketball out there on the concrete.  Bouncing basketball.  Got it in his hand, back and forth, one hand to the other.  Or looking forward to being a football player.  That's the second thing.  All right?  Now, if that doesn't look very promising, then in the front of his mind, talking about the black male now, the young black male, he's thinking about maybe singing a song, glorifying the ghetto third wife.  This is in 2018.  All right?  I'm going to write a song, I'm going to sing a song, I'm going to maybe be on the stage, and one of these days, maybe if I'm lucky, I'm going to, you know, write a song about glorifying the prison third life, all right?  And what does the third life consist of?  Killing other black people and pushing black females around.  That's just about it.  You don't hear in the lyrics and anything about anything else about building anything.  All right?  I don't hear it from what I hear.  Of course, I'm not up on all of that.  But very seldom do you hear anything that has anything to do with anything except showing off and killing.  and doing little petty things to impress members of the female sex.  That's the black ambition.  It doesn't go any farther than that.  I mean, you can nail that down.  It's not going to... You start talking about engineering and all like that, and start talking about space exploration, and start talking about harvesting, coming up with formulas for making better crops or something.  Oh, no, that's nowhere on the radar.  Nowhere on the radar.  I mean, that's considered white folk stuff.  All right?  And then, and the fourth one, is being a ghetto thug.  Not singing about being a thug, but being a ghetto thug.  And not being a universal thug even.  Just, you know, small time.  Ghetto thug.  Don't move outside the ghetto with your thuggism because you know that you move outside the ghetto with that thug stuff.  by how far you're going to get with it on the first day.  Not very far.  So you make a big deal.  in the little prison, part of the prison that you're given space to do it, of terrorizing people in bus stops, shooting into a crowd of black people at a picnic, stuff like that.  Now I'm talking about what you look forward to, truth be told.  17, 18 years old, what's really going on in your mind?  Going down the street, bouncing that ball.  And if that doesn't look promising after a few bounces, doesn't look like you're going to make the big leagues.  Big time.  Or walking down the street, thinking about being a linebacker.  And that doesn't look promising.  You got hurt in high school doing it.  So now you're licking.  So what's left?  Singing a song.  Writing a song.  Making a record.  Making a record about what?  About Thurgood.  What else do you know?  What else do you see around you?  So you're gonna make another one of the millions of records that are about Thurgood.  Thurgood among whom?  Among other black people.  You know?  Killing other black people.  Stealing from other black people.  Robbing other black people.  Alright?  And then if that seems like you're not going to be really good at that, then you actually don't sing about being a third.  You start thinking seriously, age 22 now, about seriously being a third simply because nothing else is ever in your radar and nobody comes to you with any other plan.  See, that's another thing.  Nobody in school or anywhere else gives you another plan.  Now, I'm not talking about theoretical stuff.  I'm not talking about you get all the theoretical stuff right from the first grade in school, all about paradise and all about, you know, being a king or a queen and all the great kings and queens that have come and gone and all like that.  But you don't get any detailed information about what you are going to do.  with that piece of paper that you have in your hand when you walk off of whatever campus you're on.  Nobody gives you details about what phone to pick up and what number to call.  that will send you on your way on the correct track.  This is what needs to be done.  We need to have a rule.  When you don't come out of any school, Unless you have a long list, maybe a whole book of pages of phone numbers that you immediately call while you've got that tape in your hand saying that you graduated.  You immediately call any one of those numbers, and they say, oh yeah, we need somebody like you right now.  And we know you're prepared, because they prepared you in that school.  No, you come out wishing and wanting to know, get somebody to tell you something about.  what do you do with that piece of paper in your hand?  Who do you go to?  Where can you go?  So you wind up in despair.  and you wind up with a 9mm pistol in your hand, shooting up the neighborhood.  This is what all your 22 years prepared you for.  That's a sad state of affairs. ",
