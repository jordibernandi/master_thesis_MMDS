            "text": "Bible Answers with Dr.  Al Garza.  Hi, welcome back to Bible Answers.  Again, I'm your host, Dr.  Al Garza.  All right, so today I'm going to be discussing one of the most common questions from my videos that I've made on Calvinism dealing with Romans 9 and on Ephesians 1 and even dealing with the language is.  the question I get is how do I know with certainty that the idea of of the teaching of salvation or soteriology in Calvinism is foreign to first century Judaism.  How do I know this?  And what evidence can I bring?  Well, there's a couple of things I want to talk about.  And this is key because I can say with 100% certainty that Paul Paul's view on righteousness or his view on the soteriology of how one becomes saved and receives eternal life is, how I can say it, that Calvinism is foreign to his concept and his teaching is based on the school of thought, where he was trained, where he was trained to be a Pharisee.  The pharisaical teachings... Background, which a lot of times is called rabbinic, pharisaical teachings, comes from two major houses of teaching in the first century Judaism.  And that is what is called Bait Halal and Bait Shammai.  Now, this was the house of Hallel and the house of Shammai, which was two different schools of thought within the pharisaical ideas of all matters.  If you came from the house of Hallel, then you would have different thoughts or views of the Torah and the prophets than the house of Shammai.  Now, these weren't.  dramatic differences.  These were differences based on a literal interpretation versus more of a spiritual interpretation.  And so they would debate and have questions on these from both houses.  Now, Paul, Shaul, came from the house of Hillel.  His training as a Pharisee, as he states in Acts, was at the feet of Gamaliel, which was Gamaliel I and even II.  Gamaliel I was the son of Hillel, which they hold as a great sage of that time, and with Gamaliel as well.  And then Gamaliel II, the grandson of Gamaliel, again, both coming from the same house, which was the house of Hillel, the teaching.  So Paul's teaching comes from that very academy, we would say, that very school of thought, the Hallel.  So it boggles me that most people don't consider to go into that and say, okay, what was the views and teachings of the Pharisees of the first century from that specific academy, that specific school of thought?  Well, I'll tell you straight out.  That school of thought, Hillel, and even Shammai, the house of Shammai, the Calvinistic view of soteriology that God elects some to be saved and passes over and doesn't elect others is completely foreign to those two houses, Hillel and Shammai.  They all believed in the pharisaical mind of the first century.  that one is made righteous by faith or in trusting in God alone.  Now, there was also debates on how works came into place.  A lot of Jews, a lot of first century leaders and the scribes started incorporating a works-based salvation that, yes, you're made righteous this way, but if you don't, but you've got to keep the commandments and follow Torah to also have eternal life.  So that idea started trickling down within the leaders.  And again, this had nothing to do with election of salvation.  Even that school of thought was foreign as far as Calvinism was foreign to their understanding.  So they added works-based.  Now Paul's teaching is consistent because he quotes Genesis with Abraham that he was made righteous by trusting in God, by faith.  And the Hebrew concept is imunah, which is trusting God.  So you're made righteous unto eternal life by trusting God.  This was a consistent understanding and theme within pharisaical Judaism of the first century from the house of Hillel and even Shammai.  Now again, Works came in from different subgroups of these ideas and concepts.  So that's why Paul deals with how Jews pursued righteousness through works of the Torah, while the Gentiles pursued it by faith or trust in God alone.  And so that clarifies that.  The concepts of Calvinism, of soteriology, is foreign to Paul's thinking as a Pharisee from the house of Hillel, period.  It did not exist in the first century, so I can't understand how any Calvinist talking about how one is saved, can easily undermine first century pharisaical understanding of soteriology, of becoming righteous for God by trusting in God alone, and that the opportunity was granted to all after the death, burial, and resurrection, that the Gentiles and... The Jews come now through the Messiah by faith, by trusting God, not by election, not by God's choice of favorite pick and choose, pick and choose, but by strictly by trusting in him and the opportunity based on their understanding of sin, death.  what the word elect mean, what the word predestined in the Hebrew concept, again, does not fit Calvinistic soteriology.  It's foreign.  So just that understanding alone.  So if you're a Calvinist and you believe in that Calvinistic soteriology, then you need to understand and explain how the house of Hillel, which Paul came from, did not ascribe to that type of teaching.  Now, if a Calvinist wants to say, well, Paul's changed his theology, That is complete nonsense.  Paul states in Acts, when he was being on trial by the Pharisees and the Sadducees, he says, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee.  Not I was, I am.  he maintained that he was a pharisee even after conversion which means he was still in the same mindset of a first century pharisaical jew.  uh in dealing with every aspect resurrection the hope of the resurrection uh salvation eternal life the messiah all those things.  it never changed.  and again you'd have to prove that.  paul says well i was a pharisee but now i'm not and my teachings now change to this Again, you will not find that.  So for any Calvinist out there, you can't escape this.  Now, in my book that I wrote, Calvinism Challenged, you know, I address part of this issue with dealing with some of the text in here.  Now, again, this is my book, Calvinism Challenged.  You can pick it up on Amazon.  I deal with some of these things.  But even outsiders like Flavius Josephus, who, again, was a first-century Jewish historian, he makes it clear, and this is what he says in one of his writings regarding Pharisees and their understanding and how they viewed stuff.  According to Josephus, the Pharisees held to a certain view that made it impossible for either free will or the sovereignty of God to cancel out each other.  So in other words, they both exist.  God's ruling over his creation does not cancel out man's freedom to choose between right and wrong or to seek God or come after him or to completely rebel after God.  They don't cancel each other out.  He says, this is what Josephus says, quote, They assert that everything is accomplished by trust or faith.  They do not, however, deprive the human will of spontaneity.  It having pleased God that there should be a mixture and that the will of fate should be added, the human will, with its virtue and baseness.  Joseph is concluded with God's having a sovereignty over his creation, but men can act virtuously or viciously on their own.  Now, In the oral tradition of the Pharisees going into the third, fourth century, which is referred to as the Mishnah, some of the traditions, the Mishnah states this, which would have been consistent with even Paul's theology as a Pharisee.  The Mishnah states, So again, You have within Jewish thoughts, you have within the first century Pharisee Jewish mindset, the idea that man has the ability to also seek God, have a choice to choose right or wrong, to choose to be righteous.  to choose to trust and put their faith in God and how Abraham was saved.  Not because they were elected, but because based on the fall.  And again, this has to go back to the Hebrew Scriptures, the Old Testament, their understanding.  Remember, the New Testament did not exist.  They read from the Hebrew Scriptures.  That was their foundation.  And since we know with certainty that Calvinistic theology, when it comes to soteriology, is foreign to the Hebrew Scriptures... they would have never had that concept or idea in the first century, specifically Paul from the house of Hillel, which is key and important to understanding Paul's theology.  So yes, I will say Calvinists misinterpret, misrepresent, and misunderstand a lot of the New Testament passages that they tried to force in their view of soteriology.  They totally misinterpret.  go over the edge.  Because that's not how the house of Hillel, the Pharisees who were trained there, understood how to become righteous before God or the fact that they had the ability to choose and put their faith and trust in God to be made righteous.  Now again, we're not talking about a lot of the perversion that happened.  Of course, you will have different pharisaical sects that came up and a lot of them based their whole righteousness on works and faith.  which you had to have both.  But in this case, Paul's theology, Paul's understanding in the area of soteriology has nothing to do with Calvinism.  Completely foreign.  Because of where he was trained from, what house he was representing.  He even says, I was at the feet of God, which was the son and grandson of of Hillel was in the same lineage.  So they would have never, he would have never had those ideas of Calvinism type theology.  Again, foreign to the first century.  So again, I hope this helps in dealing with Paul's soteriology.  Which house did he come from?  And if you weren't aware of this, I encourage you to do your homework on this.  Look this stuff up.  Check out the first century Jewish ideas and content from the house of Hillel and how they understood him, what Paul's training came from.  Most Christians and even reformers do not go back to that area of thinking of, okay, of Paul's training.  Where did he come from?  Where was he trained to thought?  What was he, what type of rabbinic teaching was he being exposed to?  And then how does that come into the play of his letters?  they don't go that far.  Unfortunately, they just stick with the Greek mind understanding, which is, again, foreign to first century Judaism.  They're more into the Hellenistic Greek concepts.  And again, which is, it's totally separate ideas.  And this is where they fall short.  So again, I hope this helps.  I didn't mean to make this video too long, but this is what seals the deal for Paul's soteriology from the house of Hillel.  And again, I hope you like this.  Please like, share, and subscribe.
