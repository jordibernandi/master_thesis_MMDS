It's been some years since my last acquaintance with Sky News, so I must be doing something right if I've made it onto your terrific show, which I've been listening to this morning.  Well, I've written to the Labour Party General Secretary asking that my expulsion by Mr Blair over the Iraq war end.  in 2003 should be rescinded.  It should be rescinded because it was contrary to rule at the time.  It was, I think, unjust.  And Mr.  Benn, Mr.  Foote, Mr.  Corbyn were all protesting outside.  Mr.  Benn and Mr.  Foote inside the expulsion hearing.  And it now looks ridiculous, Neil.  Everybody now knows that I was right about Iraq, and it was Mr Blair and his friends that were wrong.  So something that was unjust, contrary to rule, and now looks ridiculous, probably should be corrected. ",

The decision was predetermined by Tony Blair.  I don't think even Mr Blair would deny that.  And I think that it's time, high time, that it was lifted.  Because we have been vindicated, those of us who said that the Iraq war... would turn into an unmitigated disaster.  In fact, we underestimated just how catastrophically wrong it would go.  And since then, of course, I've twice beaten the Labour Party in parliamentary elections, two of the most significant election results, I think, of recent times.  And I'm the man that beat Roy Jenkins, the head of the last breakaway.  You're talking about breakaways.  I'm quite good at beating the leaders of breakaways, so maybe I could do a job for them.

Luciana Berger was three times elected as a Labour MP in Liverpool, Wavertree.  That doesn't sound like anti-Semitism to me.  Anti-Semitism is less now than it was when Miliband was the leader, a Jewish leader.  There was more anti-Semitism, according to the statistics of Jewish organisations themselves.
