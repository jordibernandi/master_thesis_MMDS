            "text": "Lately I've been thinking about how loyalty even fits into today's world.  Is loyalty an old peg in today's round hole?  Maybe this is coming off the back of my last video discussing being a more honorable friend, but I've been struggling to reconcile what loyalty even means today as a person who's trying to live by good, honorable standards.  The fast world of business is the obvious modern example.  It has no time to accommodate loyalty.  It's a burden.  And I have nothing against the business world.  It works, it's efficient, and I've always admired efficiency.  But I think it plays a part in how we use and abuse loyalty today.  Let me illustrate with a recent example I had in my own life.  For a while now I'd been paying way too much for my electricity bill.  But like many things in life, the notion of I'll get around to it sometime soon becomes never.  You know, life sweeps you up in its routines and so ostensibly I stayed loyal to an entity that was continuing to take advantage of me.  But recent events made switching to another cheaper electricity provider a necessity.  And so as soon as the transfer took place, surprise, surprise, my old provider calls me up with a pretty little voice on the other end of the phone saying, Great news, sir.  We're happy to offer you our special retention discount of 40% off all of your future bills for a year if you'll stay with us.  Isn't that great?  And I replied, now you're offering me a discount when I'm leaving?  Yes, sir, because you're a valued customer and we don't want to lose you.  And I said, sorry, I would have appreciated this discount during the last few years while I was loyal and while you were conveniently overcharging me by 40%.  But my words didn't register and she continued with her script.  But sir, this offer is an amazing deal.  yada yada yada and so after a few more times of her willfully ignoring my reasons for leaving i decided to waste my breath one last time as a parting gift and said to her let me use a metaphor that this recorded conversation might help someone up higher understand.  i said imagine a woman who's been taken advantage of and abused by her husband for years and then when she's had enough and finally says I'm leaving, then, only then, you, the husband, suddenly starts buying her flowers and treating her better.  I mean, would you stay?  To which she just continued, I understand, sir, but this offer... Look, I interrupted her.  I've got to go.  But I hope you treat your existing customers better than me before they decide to leave.  Bye, and I hung up.  And look, it's business.  It's nothing but impersonal mathematics.  Just like males and females have their nature, so too does a business.  I completely get it.  But the growing human concern today in headlines out there is always about the exploitation and atomization of us and our human connection, our depression, our loneliness, our skyrocketing suicide rates, people's lack of resilience.  And as a consequence, we're isolating ourselves into digital straitjackets to stay as safe as we can.  And now we're even scrambling to curb or censor each other.  like fucking snitches, to the very bully that exacerbates the problem, Big Brother, though thinking nothing of the language of Big Brother themselves, i.e.  their marketing and advertising.  They are the awful parents that care nothing for its children, but somehow we seem to turn to them for safety at every turn.  One might say, but human, these businesses aren't doing anything wrong.  They're offering a service and it's not their fault if you allow them to overcharge you, is it?  Technically, you're right.  I agree.  But it's the Machiavellian way in which they use morality as a slot machine lever rather than a human moral conviction.  And again, yes, I know they're not a human being.  But I mean, why are the so-called honest and open parts of the agreement written in microscopic fine print at the bottom that you can't see?  It reminds me of the person who infects someone with an STD.  and when asked, did you tell them you had an STD beforehand?  They respond, well, they didn't ask.  And look, I've had firsthand experience of how the business world works in advertising and marketing agencies.  I've been working in them my whole life.  And I've been in countless brainstorming sessions where the only driving force for a campaign was to exploit a human being's good nature and soft spots in order to make them do what the company wanted.  abusing people's naivety through just the right kind of words and images to make people trust the ad was the tool of choice in that board room the blunt tool of choice.  the amount of times i witnessed fathers and mothers in board rooms patting themselves on the back when they came up with sleazy ad slogans which amounted to little more than, this is your fear, but we will protect you, followed by those microscopic lines at the bottom telling you how they have every intention not to protect you.  Daily I'd hear such phrases in the boardroom like, Use the image of the old grandfather holding his granddaughter in his arms with the slogan, For the things that matter.  as they all patted themselves on the back for a campaign designed to charge elderly people more for insurance.  You know, it amazes me how concerned we are today about individual nobodies like you or I online, and what we say or think, effectively policing ants, clutching our pearls in fear, censoring not what is said but what it might incite in the minds of idiots.  But those same social justice warrior idiots think nothing of the intentional malevolent language of advertising and marketing.  Big brother, it's amazing.  I can't fathom the loyalty people have to the machine, but not to each other.  Is it just our survival instincts siding with the bigger, more powerful entity like a hypergamous wife?  A consistent, legitimate gripe one hears over and over from men sharing personal experiences amongst each other is, if not the main gripe, is the betrayal of their loyalty from someone in their past they once trusted, usually their ex.  And after understanding the nature of us as human beings, many of us let go of that loyalty gripe.  That is, it doesn't frustrate you.  after you accept it for what it is.  You take the red pill and you accept things for what they are.  You accept nature for what it is, in both the male and the female.  And look, I don't begrudge my exes.  Even the nasty and cruel ones.  Not anymore.  I really and truly don't.  Not in that personal and visceral way I used to when I was younger, where my catharsis consisted largely of finger-pointing and swearing at their ghost.  But understanding the nature of the world has helped a lot to alleviate the personal aspect of things for me.  I still remember an embarrassing moment many years ago when I told an ex-girlfriend of mine that I was madly in love with at the time that no matter what you do, I'll never leave you.  There is nothing you can do to make me give up on us.  Nothing.  Yep, I was that guy once, and you probably guessed what happened shortly after that.  Look, I admit it wasn't my finest hour, but one insight I've had since then is that the idea of no matter what, loyalty means no loyalty at all, really.  Because it's based on no standards.  It doesn't have any.  And the hero, as I was in that moment, that rewards bad behavior with blank check loyalty does not deserve respect.  He might deserve pity, but not praise.  And looking back on it, I probably did get pity from my ex in those moments.  Pity like one would to a dog you felt sorry for.  And let's face it, for the most part, men are figuratively dogs when it comes to women in relationships.  We're excessively loyal, embarrassingly so, compared to women, typically speaking.  I'd say men almost have a faith in women like religion, and it's hard to break that hard wiring.  Reproduction needs it, I guess.  But I'd say it's always good to remind ourselves that, just like Caesar was reminded, memento homo, I think we should always be whispering to ourselves, she's just a woman, she's just a woman.  I think much of our angst as men would vanish if we only remembered this more often.  And there's a reason men love dogs, generally, much more than cats, gentlemen.  We admire and love the loyalty a dog possesses as an absolute.  It comes out of the box loyal.  What a fine and perfect product.  Man's best friend.  The epitome of pure love, loyalty and devotion.  The immovable, unquestionable, almost biblical loyalty of dogs amazes us.  It can sit there in silence and connect with us men perfectly, without words.  The same unspoken language.  It'll never betray you for another.  A dog is the finest definition of loyalty.  Stories of dogs risking their lives for their masters, no matter how questionable the master has treated the dog.  The dog's always wagging its tail in love and loyalty regardless.  And I think many of us try and love women like this, love them like dogs.  And I mean this in the most complimentary way possible.  Notice how women will probably get offended as a knee-jerk reaction as describing them as dogs.  But curiously, not when we describe them as self-serving, aloof cats.  But that's a discussion for another day.  Anyway, I think men, without being conscious of it anyway, want to love women to the highest standard possible when they're with a girl intimately.  And so they're loyal and love like a dog, mistaking her as one too.  We're effectively projecting.  And that's men's frustration and mistake.  Because we're wanting to love a dog intimately.  reciprocated back to us from a fucking cat and a cat can't?  we're effectively saying here kitty kitty kitty love me like a dog.  i mean to frame our perspectives back to human beings in terms of loyalty.  shouldn't we pity this simple dog from a human perspective instead of loving it?  and to be fair i think much of the manosphere has grown as a rational reaction to male dogs trying to do their best at walking away from abusive feline mistresses.  but the fact is men are biologically hardwired to be those loyal dogs Far, far too loyal for the most part.  My advice, find something else to be loyal toward, gentlemen, other than sex, and you'll stop loving like a dog in heat.  When all is said and done, loyalty in this context just seems like the simple dependency of a dog to me.  And can be summed up in one short pitiful sentence.  Don't leave me.  And the stoic in me today dry reaches at that statement.  Because I remember what I used to be many years ago.  And I know, I know, gentlemen, the sensible economic morality keeps pushing us to think of just the money and be damned with all the rest and forget about everything else.  Take the smartest, cheapest deal in the case of my electricity bill previously, right?  But really, even if it's offered by the entity who's been using you as a doormat?  Is this the dry and inhuman mathematical standard of today?  Just business all the time?  I can't help realizing that we're turning into machines or whores, gentlemen, and I'm not quite sure which.  Is this us evolving in a perverse way and letting go of our antiquated sentimentality to survival instincts of loyalty we just simply don't need anymore?  Now that the world is more connected and safer, I honestly don't know.  I'm posing the question.  I mean, scarcity is gone.  It's an endless digital network of people.  Why should I act loyal or decent to Jim over here, when a thousand other potentially better Jims are probably waiting for me with a click or a swipe?  Don't like your group of friends?  No problem, backstab Docs or smear them on your way out the door.  Fuck it, you're anonymous anyway and just move to another group of people on the internet anonymously again and rinse, repeat and you move frivolously without contemplation or forethought because there's no consequences online and not because of ideals but because you're bored.  You can't even stay loyal to what you were into yesterday.  A new relationship is a swipe away for similar reasons.  New friends, new everything.  Keep us from the burden of loyalty to anyone or anything, even our values.  What a relief, huh?  Great.  It's like your own personality TV with a million channels.  you can click through forever and binge on.  Everything is fast food and so endlessly abundant.  Why the hell should we stop trying the options that loyalty restrains us from?  Relax, I'm playing devil's advocate in order to get us to ponder the world and maybe as a consequence, our own values.  A good mantra for me has always been, do what's right or do what's easy.  And usually the easy thing has never worked out for me that well.  And as this video is illustrating, I'm still struggling with accepting today's easy methods, gentlemen, even though the advertising out there is promoting that I should just jump in.  I don't know.  It just looks unfulfilling to me past the very first move.  Maybe though the world has become easier and easy is an option.  my stubborn old ethical model is resisting because I'll need to change who I am.  And as Danny Glover once said, I'm getting too old for this shit.  I don't know.  I've been chewing on loyalty and its ethics of late and its crooked picture frame hanging on the society wall has bothered me.  And I guess this video is a little different to many of my previous ones, gentlemen.  It's less about me having a strong opinion and more of me posing a question.  Is loyalty dying?  Should it?  Has it already?  And am I deluding myself, refusing to accept the new world?  Is loyalty a risk we could do without?  Is it a responsibility my human shame and anxiety could do without?  Think about this.  Existentially speaking, the more we're in the soup of gynocentrism, are we becoming more female, figuratively speaking, casting off the burden of loyalty and learning to do so as time goes on?  Something to think about.  Are more and more men over time getting in touch with their female sides in this way?  You know, casting off loyalty and then coldly seeing the benefits of it in your world materialistically.  Am I just that dog that needs to learn new tricks in today's world, gentlemen?  Do we all?  Our survival as a species might?  But the part of me that is inspired by everything that's come before me and waking up for something good tomorrow, hopes not.  Maybe it's just a matter of recalibrating the old model of loyalty as we see it for today's world.  I just don't know how to do it.  It might just be that kind of adjustment of the compass or a new operating system.  Anyway, no firm stances today gentlemen, just thoughts on this one.
