Anyone with a brain would know how the vanishing point works.  We don't need videos dedicated to explaining this.  The problem is that when things move further away, they will never appear to set below something that is underneath them.  In this case, the Sun should never appear to disappear behind the Earth.  Everything else, when they get further away, disappear by shrinking into a size that can no longer be seen.  But no!  For some reason, the Sun doesn't do that.  It sinks below the ground instead.

            "text": "Yes, excellent.  Finally an explanation that makes more sense than just perspective.  Alright, so there are many things I need to point out here.  I do agree that this is the best argument I've heard, but it is still full of flaws.  For one, atmospheric refraction isn't always present.  In fact, depending on the condition of the atmosphere, it could just be normal or the opposite could happen.  Which means if this model were true, then only sometimes would we see the Sun set below the Earth, and sometimes it would just disappear into the vanishing point.  It wouldn't just be consistent every morning and every night.  Atmospheric refraction doesn't just happen every day.  Depending on the weather conditions and your location, lensing can happen to different degrees.  One example is that a greater gradient of temperatures causes greater refraction, and that can be caused by a number of factors.  Gradient of humidity and pressure are also essential factors.  If the index of refraction is greater on the Earth's surface compared to higher above, then the light bends downwards, and vice versa.  Which leads me to my second point.  The lensing you are showing in your demonstration is different than that of the video you showed before.  While seeing the Chicago city is due to light bending downwards towards the earth, the sun setting on a flat earth demonstration there can only be done through the opposite, light bending away from the earth.  This is indeed possible though, so I won't dismiss it right away.  Objects can appear to be lower than their actual positions, given the correct conditions.  and this is generally more rare and happens more often in the afternoon.  This is because the ground is usually hotter during the afternoon which heats up the air closer to the earth, which causes that air to be less dense compared to higher up, thus bending light away from the normal.  This isn't something that always happens and happens less often during sunrise and sunset, which is why this model doesn't explain the sun's behavior on the flat earth.  I do applaud you for suggesting this though, but it is still flawed and isn't reality whatsoever. ",

I'm sure you're familiar with the argument that on a flat earth, the sun should be visible at all points during the night.  Atmospheric refraction and lensing doesn't happen 24-7 for all days of the week, so it makes no sense to never see the sun during the night.  But then you brought up the argument that water in the air eventually dissipates the light from the sun if you are too far away.  And yes, I am impressed by this argument.  However, that only applies to water in its liquid state and not in its gaseous state.  Clouds can block sunlight because it's liquid water, but water vapor is different.  Now it is true that the atmosphere can block sunlight though due to the many solid particles and aerosols that exist, but it's not nearly enough to potentially block out all the sunlight if it were on the other side of the earth during the night.

If you have a sunrise in an area that isn't over an ocean, then we couldn't see this.  What's the supposed illusion for that?  See, it's important to be able to see explanations in all other aspects.  Now, addressing that phenomenon directly, yes, the reflection does happen.  It's evident in the footage you just showed us.  But to claim that it can only happen on a flat plane is nonsense.  It can very much easily happen on a curved earth as well.  And in fact, this reflection actually proves its convexity.  The type of reflection seen here is due to a degree of specular reflection, where the water acts like a mirror.  With the Sun, this type of reflection actually proves a small degree of observable convexity.  Now, I won't be using the footage you gave since it's not very clear, but here are some other images.  Here, you can see a sunrise over Lake Michigan, which I pulled from a paper I found online.  If the Earth were indeed flat, the reflection of the portion of the Sun would be the same size as the actual Sun.  But instead, we see a portion of it cut off and the reflection clearly portrays a bigger sun that appears to be closer.  This is because of the convexity of the earth, which causes the water to stretch the image before the light reaches our eyes.  And this isn't just for the sun.  Here's another image of some landscape.  The height of the reflection is always shorter than that of the actual land, and that is due to the fact that the earth is curved.  While the height is shorter, the width is always the same.  That's how you can tell.  Now if we were on a flat plane, the image should appear to be the exact same size as the actual object.  But that doesn't appear to be the case, so for now it looks like we've earned another point for Team Globerth.  Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go grab my big paycheck from NASA.
