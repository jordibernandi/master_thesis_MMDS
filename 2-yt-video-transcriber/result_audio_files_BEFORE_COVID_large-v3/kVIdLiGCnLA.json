            "text": "Hey, what's up, guys?  Running Man here.  Look, when you're reading the news these days, you really got to use your head because there's so many articles, there's so many news sources that are twisting information.  Now the information is there if you dig, but you got to dig and you got to use your brain because it's often not being presented for what it is.  Uh, you know, just today I woke up this morning, I read the news, I came up to the pool and I've already come across like two pretty extreme, uh, I would say almost like forms of deception.  The first thing I watched was this interview of a woman named Harriet Lerner.  She wrote a book called The Dance of Anger, which I thought was a great book.  And it was about how anger is an important thing for humans.  It tells you, just like physical pain when you've got a problem, you know, you have something wrong with your leg or whatever, it tells you, okay, I've got to be careful with that.  I've got to fix that, right?  Pain tells you that.  And anger tells you how you feel about life.  So when you find yourself getting angry about something, it's almost like a message, like that's something you value.  It teaches you who you are.  And anger is an important thing.  for human beings.  So it was a great book.  I thought it was good.  And then I watched it.  I thought, well, I want to watch it.  I read the books.  I'll watch an interview of her on a podcast this morning.  And so I started watching it.  And like half the interview... Now, this is from the woman who did the research.  This is the woman who figured out, basically, anger is often presented as an evil thing, a bad thing.  And she's basically saying, no, anger isn't important.  It's something that warns you.  It tells you important messages.  And the book's great.  The problem is when you started to get off the book onto her own opinions about things, she actually misused her own data, in my opinion, pretty badly too, because half of the interview was about... How women are not allowed to show anger and men are allowed to be angry and women are this and that.  But that was not at all.  the focus of her research, which was quite interesting, was that anger is an important emotion.  And there was nothing in her data that said men and women are different on this, is that both men and women, when they find themselves feeling an emotion, it's an important message that this is something they care about and something to be paid attention to.  But instead, she takes her whole narrative of basically feminism into this discussion and it completely changes it.  It's like not even an honest interview at all.  And there's a man interviewing her.  So it's like, it's really, it's really, you know, tedious.  I couldn't watch it.  And so often, We come so close to the truth and it's just sabotage at the last second.  So then I go on to the news and I'm reading the news and there's an article on the Dredge Report.  It says about the importance of fathers in children's lives.  And I'm like, oh, that's interesting.  So I clicked on it.  And the article was quite good.  It just basically... There was a video.  There's an original video by Bradford Wilcox, W. Bradford Wilcox, his research into the importance of the impact of fathers on children regarding child abuse, child neglect, and many other important issues.  And so he was being interviewed by Christina Hoff Summers, which I really like.  And it was a great interview.  It was... He just like, boom, boom, boom.  And... In his data, I'll go through a couple of points, is that daughters who have... Okay, here's the important thing.  Daughters raised in nuclear families are more likely to flourish educationally and professionally.  And this is from data, this is peer-reviewed data.  So they went into women in their 20s and they looked at women who, how far did they go in their education, and they went farther, got better grades, when the father was in the home.  And when they went back and they looked at them in their late 20s, women did better when they had a father in the home.  And so basically saying, like, the nuclear family is very important.  Now, I'm not making any argument either here or there, but this is, like, what the research says.  Now, sometimes, again, it's like an inconvenient truth, right?  You know, that fathers are important, that intact families are important, right?  Nobody really wants to know that because we've kind of decided as a society that, you know, it doesn't matter.  Men aren't that important and women can raise the children just fine and play their role.  There's all this kind of like memes going around.  But when you get data, that's not what it says.  This was a study across class lines, so very wealthy and very poor.  Women with a father present, okay, so it wasn't just biological nuclear families, it was women with a father present were much less likely to become pregnant as teenagers.  And they were, Women especially daughters who were raised by their father with with a father involved that this one was not so clear.  I didn't know it was biological intact families or when the father is emotionally connected and involved.  I was a little bit unclear.  but Basically when when men are very involved in the daughter's life there nine times Less likely to be physically and sexually abused nine times.  And so basically, children are much safer when they are raised with their father present.  And whenever the father was not present, okay, so as is often the case, the increase, the chance of child abuse went up nine times.  Now, I don't think society is ready to hear this kind of thing.  Society doesn't want to know this.  They want to just like ignore it.  So it's very interesting how this works and why it's so important to logically deduce things and to follow things.  Don't believe logical fallacies and to use your brain.  So I read the article.  It was very accurate until the last paragraph.  Let me read you the last paragraph.  The last paragraph said, all this being said, if you don't have a dad in your life, you are still capable of great things.  Now that's true, right?  Father figures, now here's the part that's completely, that just sabotages the whole argument.  Again, this is not the research.  This is the, basically you have a journalist using valuable research and they're putting a link like a video link inside of a blog post.  okay so here's where they put their own opinion in and this basically sabotages the whole argument.  father figures come in many forms and just because he might not be your biological father does not mean he is not important.  sometimes the people who are there for us are are are the most the most are not the ones we expect them to be.  So basically, actually it's poorly written.  But they're saying their opinion in the end of this.  But this is not what the research says.  The research is very different.  Now, sometimes this is difficult stuff, right?  The research says a nuclear family with the father emotionally involved in the daughter's lives protects her life, her education, the chance she's going to be abused, the chance she's going to be a teenage mother, and all these basically very, which everybody would agree are terrible things for daughters.  in the father is very important in the daughter's life.  but even with this data you have news sources basically negating the whole thing because in the end the article they're basically saying like oh yeah anybody can be a father it doesn't matter it doesn't matter.  but logically what's actually happening here.  actually it's interesting because i thought about it this morning.  What they're actually saying in the blog post is actually more important.  Because what they're saying is that father fingers come in many forms, and there's many types of men that are important.  So what they're really saying is that the research is true.  They're not negating the fact that the biological father in a nuclear family equals a nine times greater chance the daughter will not be sexually abused.  okay that they're not negating.  but what they're saying is is they're saying that there are other men are very important influence on children and that on top of that uncles uh you know other loving men are also very important.  so really what they're saying is like what they're not trying to say.  because what they're actually saying is yes the biological father is the most important factor in sexual abuse of a daughter And in her success in education and likelihood of becoming a teen mother, the father is the most important factor.  And a biological father and an intact nuclear family is the most important factor.  But what they're actually saying is, they're saying even more than that, is that his friends, other men involved, other loving men in the child's life are also... very important factors.  so now that hasn't been researched but that's just logically makes sense right?  just like a mother has a very big impact on children but other loving women will also have a big impact right?  so they're actually the blogger with what they're trying to do.  is they're trying to like they're it's a sleigh of hand.  they're saying yeah yeah but you can just have any kind of father and it's important.  now I disagree that if you don't have a father, okay?  See, it's so tricky how the modern, I don't know, journalists are just twisting the facts and allowing children to be abused.  I don't disagree that if you don't have a father, of course you have to make do with what you have.  And that's one of the... There is a way to have a very successful life without a father.  And that is true, but that's not what they're saying.  That is if the father dies, let's say goes to war and passes away, then you just have to make the best do.  But why would you... If you knew... that the most important factor for the child being sexually abused was the biological father being at home in a nuclear family.  Why would you take that away?  It's like you can swim with a rock tied to you.  Okay, but why would you do it?  Why wouldn't you just swim in your bathing suit instead of being weighed down by a 100-pound rock?  What is the point of deliberately sabotaging the chances of your success?  And that's what they're not saying in the article.  So when you read the news today, you just cannot take it on face value.  You have to read deeper.  Because men are being methodically taken out of children's lives.  And it's not just that.  The value that you have as a man is being negated.  And that's why you see so much suicide.  That's why you see men dying so much younger than women.  It is your value and your As a human, like, the whole thing.  when you see people committing suicide is because they're like, there's no meaning.  I don't matter.  Nothing matters, right?  Nothing matters.  When things matter, you're much less likely to commit suicide, to despair, right?  So when a... When a powerful news organization deliberately misuses very important data that can protect children in order to further an agenda, You know, I just don't know what to do about this kind of stuff.  I mean, we're talking about the Drudge Report here.  It's known as a very conservative site, right?  But they're allowing some SJW to basically say, and the author doesn't even put their name on the article, which is really hilarious.  The site that it was on is called Awareness Act.  if you want to find it.  But, you know, how do you navigate modern society?  Like, how do you do it for yourself?  Because it's not easy these days.  It is fucking not easy because even when you have good data, like, what they're doing is like, okay, just in a nutshell, You know about clickbait, right?  Clickbait, you're basically just trying to get people to click on an article.  Then they get to the article, they don't read it.  The headline tells them everything they need to know and people don't take the time to read the article.  That is something that an unscrupulous journalist will do in order to get clicks, in order to get SEO value, in order to make money on advertising, right?  and they'll have a deliberately misleading title or exaggerated title or whatever.  Now, there's another version of that, and that is what I'm talking about here, is you have a gem, okay, which is the report, which is the research by W... What was his name again?  W. Bradford Wilcox, and then you're taking this video and you're relying on the fact that that you know as a journalist that that most people don't have time to watch the video so what they're going to do is they're just going to read the summary.  but the problem is the summary at the end of the summary.  it negates the whole point.  it negates the whole point.  and that negation is not without impact because children will be physically and sexually abused because they will believe that review that a summary.  And that's what's going on.  I mean, it's fucking outrageous.  It is so fucking outrageous.  You can have fantastic research that is, can protect our children.  And you can have a journalist just twisting it, just twisting it for their own benefit.  And to the child's detriment.  And then, you know, life moves on, right?  Another man is kicked out of a child's life.  Another child is abused.  Nine more children are abused.  Nine times greater.  And nobody even notices.  And there's no debate.  There's no debate.  Now, I am not going to debate the nuclear family because... I just, it's not my, that is not my, what do you call it?  Like one of my hot button issues.  I just think that I'll leave that one to the MRAs.  But I do care about kids getting abused.  And that is fucking important.  And that is like probably, it's probably like one of the biggest issues.  I think abuse of children is like... It's like terrible.  I can relate.  And I don't think... I don't like it.  I don't want to see it happen.  And when there's research out there that teaches me how to protect children, and then there's people deliberately using that in order to leave children vulnerable, I just feel like... Fuck.  I mean... What is going on here?  What are we allowing to happen?  So... if you have anything like that where you're reading an article and it's like useful information, but it's deliberately being twisted, uh, tell me about it in the comment box.  because this shit is dangerous because it relies on the fact that you're busy and that you don't have time to like.  you know we just don't have time to like.  when you buy toothpaste at walmart right you don't buy it and then wonder if it's safe and send it to a chemistry lab to be tested for long-term cancer causing.  you know it might cause cancer but as long as there's toothpaste on it inside of a Walmart, you figure that's good enough, right?  That's how we live our lives.  We say, okay, that's good enough.  That's safe enough, right?  That's okay.  I'll just move on.  I'm busy.  And this is how narratives, even if they come so close to the truth, so close to a good thing, they are just sabotaged and we move on.  And so it's almost like his research didn't even exist.  And those children that were abused don't exist.  And we just, boom, next, next, next, next, next.  And nobody takes the time, right?  That's what I love about this whole community is that guys are like, guys have brains and they're taking the time to break shit down.  They're being honest with themselves.  They're not, what do you call it, reactionary.  Where it's like, hey, everybody's an idiot, they're all idiots, blah, blah, blah.  It's like, no, what's wrong here?  What's wrong here is that you're using valuable data that can protect children for your own agenda.  And it's being twisted to say that any man can be a father, but that's not the research.  Now, I'm not saying that there couldn't be more research about the importance of men even if they're not biological fathers and i'd like to see that research.  but that is not what this particular research talked about.  and so this is what we we have value here.  right let's let's let's take that value let's take that into consideration and let's protect kids right.  and by protecting kids we're not just protecting kids.  we're making our lives better and we're making society better.  We're lowering crime, we're lowering teenage pregnancy, we're lowering abuse, we're making people happier.  So let's not let people abuse children Increase crime and unhappiness, which is what, to me, that's what this journalist is doing in the end.  That's the reality.  That's the end result of what they're doing.  Don't let it happen, at least in your own mind.  All right, guys.  I hope you guys have a great day and talk to you later. ",
