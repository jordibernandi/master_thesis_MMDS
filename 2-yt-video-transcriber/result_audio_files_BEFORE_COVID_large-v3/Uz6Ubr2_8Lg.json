            "text": "Dear YouTube viewing audience, What you are about to watch is an attempt by a grown adult man to discuss and analyze an eight-year-old film made for children.  That film is entitled Gnomeo and Juliet, a 2011 computer animated film distributed by Touchstone Pictures and co-produced by Sir Elton John's Personal Film Studio, which ostensibly exists only to make Elton John-related content, yes, even the ones that people seem to like.  For this project, I've watched the film multiple times, and watched promotional material showcasing its very famous voice talent doing their damnedest to hype this innocuous project, which will have little to no impact on their larger careers beyond having something to show their very young kids as proof that they do in fact have jobs in motion pictures.

            "text": "The protagonists of this film were all traditional garden gnomes.  The practice of adorning gardens with small figurines goes back to the Roman Empire, but the first proper garden gnomes date to 1841, when the Dresden-based company Baer & Marisch kept small ceramic dwarf figurines for sale.  The Gardensverga, or garden dwarves, spread from Saxony to Thuringia and then to France, and finally to England, where Sir Charles Edmund Isham, 10th Baronet, imported 21 terracotta figurines to his home in Lamport Hall, Northampton, where they were first called gnomes.  an alchemical, mystical creature first described by Paracelsus in the 16th century, the name possibly derived from the Latin genomos, roughly meaning earth dweller.  None of this information will enrich your life in any way.  The film's ceramic protagonist also serves as an aesthetic shortcut, since CGI is expensive and most rendering software can handle porcelain better than human skin, which is why the two human characters, Ms.  Montague and Mr.  Capulet, are always kept obscured.  The gnomes are divided into red and blue groups, allowing them to reenact the tragic story of the Crips and the Bloods.  That statement was, to the best of my ability, a joke.  For this is, in fact, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, a story which, as the movie admits, has been told before.  A lot. ",

            "text": "A lot.  The film admits its shameless rating of the public domain freely, while simultaneously commenting on its generally loose relation to the work.  Indeed, the film bears little of the Bard's language, save for scant quotation, or sly hypertextuality towards the author's greater canon.  In fact, the greater artistic presence in the film's text is not Shakespeare's words, but the musical compositions of Sir Elton John, whose works are woven throughout the score in quotations ranging from orchestral rearrangement to full pop cover to direct sampling, to digitalization.  It's a simple strategy of allowing the film to have fun, kid-friendly musical moments, with the economic bonus of not needing to pay for any original songs.  This market-tested kid-friendliness also encourages a sense of whimsy and innocence possibly best exemplified by this sequence, where the rival gnome factions compete not through bloody street swashbuckling, but by competitive lawnmower racing set to a lyrically adapted version of Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting.  One of these races ends in the shattering of Tybalt, resulting in his death, as the character does die in the play.  This death is then undone by the end by showing Tybalt alive, though crumbling, yet still able to participate in the film's mandatory dance party epilogue.  For you see, dear viewers, unlike the play, which ends with the death of its title characters and an easily avoidable double suicide, the film ends with a big stupid dance party set to crocodile rock.  This practice of changing a work to suit the needs of middle-class family values is called Boldlerization, after Thomas Boldler, who in 1818 infamously published The Family Shakespeare, which altered passages and in some cases omitted entire characters to appeal to 19th century morals.  For this, boldlerize became a verb describing the act of radically altering a text for the purpose of moral censorship.  While the film is guilty of boulderization, it admits its guilt through the presence of a statue of William Shakespeare voiced by Sir Patrick Stewart, who summarizes the end of the play succinctly.  She feigns her death.  He finds her, thinks her dead, takes his own life.  She wakes, finds him dead, takes her life, both dead.  Exeunt omnes, the end herden!  This allows the filmmakers to replace it with their own ending, an all-out garden war featuring an overpowered lawnmower voiced by professional wrestler Hulk Hogan.  Your lawn will be afraid to grow!  Terra firminator!  No, no! ",

            "text": "Sure.  Perhaps the lone dramaturgically interesting facet of the film is that through the introduction of the original author as a character, Gnomeo and Juliet admits its own tension between being an adaptation of a universally beloved work of theater and being a kid's movie, tension which is solved by openly siding with its market needs.  And the result is an aesthetic blandness that sent me into a month-long depression which I spent avoiding writing entirely instead of spending most of my time lying either on my bed or on my couch trying to beat my high score on 2048, a free game which I've invested years of my life into, a game which I play instinctively for the purpose of distracting my brain from unpleasant thoughts, such as, why did I decide to use my limited time on Earth to make videos in which I pretend to be smart online like every other gormless, pseudo-academic jackass on this platform for soulless venture capitalists, empathy-division quasi-intellectual grifters, and hopeless multitudes of validation junkies like myself?  And in particular, why oh why did such an overwhelming depressive state have to hit me?  because of the ludicrous fact that I dedicated my labor to an ex-jesus of a children's film about garden gnomes?
