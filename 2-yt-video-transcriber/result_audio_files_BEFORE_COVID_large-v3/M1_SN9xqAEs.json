I feel so sad knowing I'm never going to see them again.  I literally cried secretly for a few seconds as I watched that other guy that I was hanging out with all day leave.  I feel like I'm about to cry again.  No, I am.  The video cut off on me, but now I'm like teary-eyed again.  I just, I sent him like good vibes and a good life.  No, I'm going to full-blown start crying.  But it's really sad when you meet like amazing people and you know you're never going to see them again.  But they're the people that make, I don't know, the world special and magical and I don't know.  Okay, I'm done.  I'm done.  Oh my God, I'm full blown crying.  I love you guys.  Keep traveling and meeting amazing people.  It's always good.  It's like it's happy and sad tears, right?  Because it's like I met someone special.  So I swear to God, I just saw the lizard.

So hopefully I'll stop crying by then.  I'm just so sad.  He was such a good person.  I can't handle it.  So we are at this beautiful high market that's only here on Friday.  And it was Friday until they told me five minutes ago on Friday and Saturday.  And then people go and they eat over there with the view and they watch the sunset.  So that's what we're about to go do.  And she's explaining to me all the translation for the food because we need some vegetarian dishes.  So I'm about to wear traditional Thai wear and I'm so excited.  I've wanted to do this for many years.  So you guys, I am in traditional Thai outfit like a princess in these in Thai outfit.
