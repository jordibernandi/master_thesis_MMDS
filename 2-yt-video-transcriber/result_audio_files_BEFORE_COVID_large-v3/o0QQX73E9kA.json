            "text": "Are you trying to dodge me?  No.  Well, I wasn't even looking for you.  I know you wasn't.  You went and parked over there.  Uh-huh.  I'm looking for somebody.  Then I came.  One more, 1918.  And then you parked right there.  I'm looking for somebody.  Who are you looking for?  Do you mind keeping your hands out of your pocket for me?  Well, look, nothing in my pocket, right?  Just keys.  This pocket got nothing in it.  Who are you looking for?  Can I see that?  Nope, you can't.  Well, actually, you have to give me your ID.  What do I do?  When a police officer asks you to identify yourself, you have to identify yourself.  Is that the state of Illinois?  Yes.  Or how that works?  Yes.  What is that law called?  It's called failure to identify yourself.  Okay, it's called Terry, Virginia, Ohio.  My name is Quentin Booker.  Okay, can I see it?  No.  My name is Quentin Terrell Booker.  Okay, let me see your ID.  The Supreme Court already ruled.  Let me see your ID.  I've given you my name enough.  It's enough.  No, it's not.  I just did that.  How am I supposed to know you're not giving me the same name?  Go look, my face is going to pop out.  How about you just give me your ID?  I don't have to do that.  I gave you my name.  Supreme Court has already ruled.  I don't want to do that with you.  You got your body cam on, so you know the law.  I'm identifying myself to you.  Terry.  Okay.  You could be giving me somebody else's name.  Nope.  Yes, you could.  I'm giving you my true name.  Why won't you just give me your ID?  I don't get it.  Because I'm looking for somebody, right?  And you was in my way.  So I was trying to avoid you and look for that person because I know what you're going to do.  All right.  So I'm looking for somebody at the same time.  Now you're stopping me.  So now I got to deal with you.  Okay.  Why I'm looking for somebody.  So Gary versus Ohio says, listen, I must identify myself to you.  You don't have to yell at me.  You don't have to yell at me.  First of all, you're trying to threaten me right now.  How am I threatening you?  All I'm asking is for your ID over here.  Well, can I see your ID?  I'm going to ask you again.  Can I see your ID?  No, ma'am.  Okay.  Failing to identify yourself.  I'm not.  My name is Terrell Booker.  Okay.  ID, please.  I just gave you all my information.  ID, please.  You can identify me as a tropical guy if you wanted to.  So your buddy Cam understands that and you do too.  Okay.  Quentin Terrell Booker.  That's all I gotta give you.  Uh, no.  You have to give me your ID, actually.  I don't have to carry an ID.  So if I don't have to carry an ID, what do I gotta give you an ID?  72 Westbound.  I'm going to ask you again.  Ma'am, call your sergeant.  Maybe he can explain it to you.  I don't know.  No, you have your ID, so you need to give it to me.  No, this ID is not even valid.  So me giving it to you means nothing.  It's not even valid.  Look.  All you have to do is give it to me.  All you have to do is give it to me.  It's not even valid.  You don't even need to give me valid IDs.  Okay, just give it to me.  Why would I give it to you if it's invalid?  Okay.  Okay.  Just give it to me.  All right.  Just give it to me.  How am I supposed to know that's actually you and you're not giving me a real name?  I'm going to sit right here.  Look, I got nothing.  I'm not going to do anything.  Go check what I said to you.  You're fine.  My name is in the system.  So who are you looking for, first of all?  I'm looking for somebody.  It's very important.  It has nothing to do with you, ma'am.  I apologize to you.  Maybe it looks suspicious what I was doing.  I apologize.  Yeah, you went and parked on the side of the road, and then you saw me again.  This is the third time you did it.  You saw me again.  You parked on the side of the road again.  It doesn't matter.  I'm not going to argue with you.  Give me your ID.  Give me your ID.  Okay, you going to call your sergeant?  After you give me your ID.  Oh, so you're not going to call your sergeant?  I'll call my sergeant.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Give me your ID.  I apologize to you, ma'am.  No, actually, no, you're not.  I apologize to you.  I'm not listening to you.  I'm just going through something, and you're detaining me right now for something that has nothing to do with you.  All you have to do is give me your ID.  I'm going to identify myself one more time for you.  My name is Quintus.  All you have to do is give me your ID.  I just gave you your ID.  This ID is not valid.  Okay, let me see it.  It's not even valid.  No need for you to see it.  It's not valid.  It's not valid.  Let me see it.  It's not valid.  Look.  Okay, look.  You can see it.  What you want to do now?  Your camera got it.  Let me see it.  No, no, ma'am.  I won't give it to you.  Okay.  It's invalid.  I presented myself.  I identified myself.  I don't even want to talk no more.  Am I free to go?  No, no.  I'm detained.  It's my backup on the way. ",
