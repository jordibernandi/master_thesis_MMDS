And it broke my heart because I think that could be one of my grandchildren.  And I believe when they come to their age of accountability and they want to accept Christ into their heart, I believe lead them in the sinner's prayer.  Yeah. ",

And some people associated that demon possession with mental illnesses too.  But yet and still, we see those individuals in their state being able to come to Christ.  And when they came, I mean, when they came, they weren't necessarily in a settled state, but they did come.  And when they came, Jesus was able to deal with them.  And I believe that they had their conversion experience. ",

            "text": "You know what, something I like is that Jesus said, I mean, he's quoted in the gospels quite often, but it says, Truly I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of God.  Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.  But Jesus said, let the little children come to me and do not hinder them.  And I think for a lot of times with mental challenge, there's a developmental challenge.  And so they're still in that childlike state.  I actually have a young lady, 19, that goes to our church.  And she has some developmental issues mentally.  And her mom... was so thankful to find a church where they weren't asked to stay out in a cry room or whatever.  And when we were doing water baptisms, actually asked me, could she be baptized?  So I had a conversation with the young lady and she was, I said, do you love Jesus?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  You know, and we talked a little bit about it and I thought, you know what?  No, she makes that decision.  I'm gonna get in there with her.  We were able to have that kind of come to Jesus moment, if you will.  So I do believe.  And if somebody can't be, then they are under that grace.  They're under that grace just like a baby who dies before they go.  They're under that grace. ",

            "text": "As a matter of fact, I've worked with mentally handicapped people for many years as a counselor and served them and took care of them.  And I've dealt with the ones that couldn't move, couldn't feed themselves, couldn't change themselves to the ones that were higher functioning.  They could go out into the community but had to come back and had to be watched over.  And people would say, well, couldn't they accept Christ?  Well, the question is, can they reject him?  And that's how I'd always gauge it.  Matter of fact, I was a pastor during that time.  And so a guy would always ask me, he's like, is there a ticket punched?  Because he would ask me, do you think this person would go immediately?  And I would tell them yes or no, based upon what I've seen with them.  Because I've seen it where I've led some of them to the Lord.  And I've seen some of them talk about God.  I don't want to hear nothing about God.  So I'm like, if you can be that adamant against him, you can also be adamant for him.  But then there were some that weren't vocal and they don't talk at all.  And they're all contorted and You had to turn them every couple hours.  You know, God knows their hearts.  And the reality is that he wants all to be saved.  And so my big thing, though, and I know I'm kind of going off the key with this one here, but the fact that I think about some of those that I've served and being in glory now.  What must it be like to have lived your whole life, never been able to walk, talk or communicate and then seeing the master and your fingers open up and your mind is right and you're sharp and all the things that they may even saw in their mind that they wanted to have happen that they never could do, they can now accomplish.

            "text": "We had a situation a few years ago at our Sunday evening, our Sunday light service.  And we get visitors every week.  We get people from all over, don't even know how they know about the service.  But we had a mother and her son who would have been in his 20s and had multiple severe, extreme mental challenges.  And one of them was Tourette's and he would just kind of call out and make noises.  I was just praying that God would speak to this young man.  The next week, the mother came up to me and she had taught her son, she had taught her son a way of communicating through touching.  She had the 26 letters of the alphabet and then he would touch those letters and then she would form the words and say the words verbally.  He was not able to communicate in the verbal sense.  So it would appear to people around that, oh, he can't communicate.  but he communicated more articulate than I can speak to his mother.  And she wanted to tell me what he had said.  And so she put this sheet there and then he spelled this out.  And he thanked me because I treated him like I wanted him to know, like I wanted him to answer.  But that's only part of the story.  A few weeks later, his mother came to me after one of the services and she said, he has something else that he wants to share with you.  That day, he had a friend with some of the same mental challenges that he had.  And he asked his mom if they could come to church so that Pastor Tom could share Jesus Christ.  So is it possible, even though we don't acknowledge that, even though we may not see that reciprocity of their communication, I believe with all of my heart that God's salvation and the gift that he's given to us is for all.  Praise be to God. ",

And I went in and led him to the Lord in the ICU before he died and actually held him by the hands and prayed with him.  And he was a good friend of mine.  His name was Bobby Gallagher.  And I remember he died, I don't know, probably 15 years ago.  And so I believe with all my heart.  And they are passionate about God.  They'll get up there and they want to go to church.  And when they can't go, man, they're like, hey, I'm going to church or I'm burning this place down.  You know, they want to get there. ",
