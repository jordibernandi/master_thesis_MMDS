Bethany, Kristen, Morgan, etc.  I think you say that so easily of me because you identify Christians by their sexuality and perhaps their sexuality alone.  Hi beautiful people!  So I'll link all the relevant videos below, but in short, there's been some drama between Girl Defined and God is Grey.  After asking Kristen and Bethany for a one-on-one conversation, they questioned my faith at a conference. ",

            "text": "After the Girl Defined conference, I put out a video expressing my feelings on this.  In response, people from both of our communities pled for them to apologize and have a conversation with me.  So this Wednesday, they made a video response.  The key here is the title.  Talking about Goddess Grey.  They did send me a nice apology and informed me they would be releasing a response video.  I thanked them and once more expressed my desire for a conversation.  But instead, apparently, the choice remains to talk about and not to me.  For Goddess Grey, I've reached out to many people I disagree with for conversation.  including Girl Defined, Ali B. Stuckey, Paul and Morgan, Mr.  Atheist, and Dr.  Julie Slattery.  Mr.  Atheist and Dr.  Julie Slattery said yes.  They were open.  These conversations led to 0% change in either of our fundamental beliefs.  Hi beautiful people.  So both conversations ended in beautiful friendship.  I respect love and root for both of these friends and they feel the same way about me.  All the others hesitate or outright refuse to talk to me because we don't see eye to eye on doctrine.  Or in Morgan's case, she refuses to even kindly speak to people that she doesn't agree with.  We will probably not ever have a back and forth with Brenda.  And you know what?  We're called to love everyone, but you don't have to like them.  And I do not like Morgan.  I find her condemning, condescending, patronizing, and hard-headed.  Yeah, awesome.  qualities I'm really not into.  I'll be putting out a video on my feelings about that, not this, but next Monday, so stay tuned.  Now again, because we're gonna continue to talk about one another and not to each other, which I really wish we would, here goes another video.  First things first, hundreds if not thousands of people demanded Girl Defined apologize to me, whether by direct comment or by liking a comment, and I love you guys for that, but an apology is actually not something I ever asked for or even wanted.  What I wanted was an open dialogue.  What I wanted was to show both of our communities how Christians can lovingly disagree.  I do appreciate the kindness in which Kristen and Bethany addressed me in this video. ",

            "text": "Bethany, did you not watch my video response?  To save myself the time and energy I will play that clip again.  This entire video is about an encounter I had with the Holy Spirit after researching and delving into this issue for 15 years.  What Bethany is failing to mention or see is that I do not present these subjects to you guys carelessly.  There is an array of books, Bible-based books, by Christians, by theologians, and many of them are concluding exactly what I did.  The reason this is so triggering is because are we allowed to study the Bible or not?  Is everyone that doesn't see theology your way lying about their relationship with Christ?  I'm not going to explain a trillion times to someone who is determined not to listen the extent of my biblical research.  Which brings me to the last ignored point.  Number three.  The main thing Girl Defines, Paula Morgan, Ali B. Stuckey, etc.  are taking for granted when they talk about me is this.  Everything you know about the Bible was passed down to you by your particular leadership in your particular circle.  Unless you want to tell me you spent five years in the Himalayan mountains with Franciscan monks debating theology.  In which case, I stand corrected.  When you say the Bible is so clear, you are wrong.  It is perhaps the single most debated, studied, and complicated text in human history.  Even the decision of which books would be included in the Bible you're reading today, which could be one of 30 English translations, came from the leadership of the Catholic Church.  When Protestants emerged, books were taken out of that original Bible.  Jewish scholars, Franciscan monks, and the Christians that I choose to keep in my personal circle are those who honor the tradition, the nuance, the complication, the contradiction, and the mystery of the Bible.  In conclusion, Bethany, Kristen, Morgan, etc.  I would never have the audacity to question whether or not you're Christians.  I will warn people when you're saying something harmful, but I will not tell them you are not a Christian.  I think you say that so easily of me because you identify Christians by their sexuality and perhaps their sexuality alone.  Brenda's having a baby out of wedlock, not ready to get married, she supports the LGBTQ community, not a Christian.  Easy.  And you'll say, it's not about that, it's my lack of repentance.  And I'll say I've dove into all the theology, and I've studied it forever, and I'm making my own personal choices, and I have conviction from God that I am okay, and you will say, not a Christian.  Meanwhile, I identify Christians by those of us who are constantly seeking God, who profess the name of Jesus.  And again, I'll link my resources below, but historically, Christians I know that are in this mindset will say, I'm not reading those, the Bible is my only authority. ",
