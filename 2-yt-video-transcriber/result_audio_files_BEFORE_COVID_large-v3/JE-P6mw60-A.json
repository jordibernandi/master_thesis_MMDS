            "text": "Back when I was still a Christian but was beginning to explore any of my doubts about the faith, I started having questions about God pop into my head just annoyingly often.  Those questions eventually piled up so high that I realized I really had to face them all head-on if I ever wanted to sleep again.  I hoped that once I explored those questions, rather than pushing them aside out of fear, I'd regain some sense of normalcy and that those nagging questions would just stop.  That did and didn't happen.  I eventually became an atheist and was no longer afraid of looking into hard questions about religion and God.  but the questions themselves just kept coming.  They didn't occur to me at the same rate as when I was first questioning, but they definitely didn't stop.  Even today, a few years later, new questions still pop into my head pretty regularly.  Over time though, with the more obvious questions out of the way at the beginning, they've gotten a little more unique, so I thought you guys might like to explore a few of those with me.  I have a couple of notes before we begin, as usual.  These questions pertain to a more Abrahamic idea of God, as in one that is supposedly omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and the creator of all that is.  For brevity, I'll occasionally refer to this kind of god as tri-omni, as in embodying all of the omni traits I just mentioned.  These questions don't have much bearing on the concepts of gods to which many polytheists hold, so I'm sorry that the title isn't 100% accurate, it's just really hard to put all of those caveats into a workable title.  So with all of that out of the way, let's get to it.  Why did God communicate through literature?  This one goes to anyone who thinks any piece of literature is the word of a tri-omni-god.  Literature, by its very nature, demands interpretation.  Intelligent people can read the same passage with the same good intentions and still come away with very different interpretations of its meaning.  We're flawed beings with abilities of perception limited to the subjective alone.  Communication through literature always leads to varying understandings of that literature.  If God authored a piece of literature, then that means that literature has an intended meaning, but that humans are bound to interpret it in differing ways, many of them missing the intended meaning.  At first glance, this seems to only reveal a flaw in human nature, but upon deeper consideration it reveals flaws in any authoring tri-omni gods.  as i'm sure you know countless sects of christianity islam and judaism exist varying wildly in practice often due to differing interpretations of holy texts.  This, inarguably, leads to suffering.  War between various sects entirely aside, I'll give an example.  Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible forbids the ingestion of any blood, including life-saving blood transfusions.  If they're right, that means that they're obeying God's will and won't be punished for violating it, while the majority of Christians who aren't JWs are further separated from God or even punished for not understanding the text.  If JWs have themselves misunderstood the Bible, though, most Christians are just fine, while the JW's misunderstanding of God's word has them dying preventable deaths.  There are countless contradictory interpretations of any holy text out there, many leading to the kind of unnecessary suffering I mentioned.  If God authored or inspired such a text, he either couldn't do any better, didn't know the suffering he would cause, or didn't care if suffering resulted.  If he couldn't do better, communicating in a medium immune to misinterpretation, then he isn't omnipotent.  If he didn't know the suffering he would cause, he's not omniscient.  If he didn't care if suffering resulted, he's not omnibenevolent.  Any way you cut it, you can't consider the author of such a text to be anything close to a tri-omni-God.  Of course, there's a reasonable explanation for the flawed nature of sacred texts.  Maybe they were just written by human inspiration alone and no God was ever involved.  Shouldn't you worship the cruelest God imaginable?  This is for fans of Pascal's Wager, which is a pragmatic, not evidential argument for belief in God over disbelief.  Just for review, the argument goes, if God doesn't exist, a believer suffers only a finite loss in death.  But if he does exist, a believer enjoys an infinite gain in heaven.  Meanwhile, if a person does not believe or act as if God exists, and they're right, they stand to gain just finite luxuries on earth.  But if they're wrong, they stand to suffer infinitely in hell.  Therefore, a rational person would seek to believe in God and live as if he exists.  Obviously, there's a false dichotomy here between the existence of a very specific God and the non-existence of God, but let's explore the logic of this argument and see where it leads.  Within the reasoning of this argument, the objectives of belief and worship are to gain pleasure and avoid pain.  The argument is purely an evaluation of risk considering well, rather arbitrarily chosen supernatural factors.  There is a way to make this argument more powerful pragmatically, though, and it's through the consideration of slightly different factors.  Instead of creating a false dichotomy between one of the many popular concepts of a god and a non-existence of god, why not create a true dichotomy between belief in a god with the best imaginable reward for believers and the worst imaginable punishment for doubters, and every other religious position?  Why not invent a god who is as cruel as can possibly be imagined to doubters in order to do away with the false dichotomy and make the wager more persuasive?  See, if you believe in and worship the definitionally cruelest god and you're right, you'll get to go to heaven.  But if you're wrong, you won't go to the worst hell imaginable.  You'll go to, at worst, a lesser hell.  If you don't believe in the definitionally cruelest god, and you're right, you'll either go to a lesser heaven, a lesser hell, maybe you'll be reincarnated, or maybe you'll go nowhere at all.  But if you're wrong, you'll go to the worst hell imaginable.  So, a reasonable person must believe in and worship the cruelest imaginable god.  This argument uses the same logic as Pascal's Wager and arguably even improves upon it by eliminating the false dichotomy.  So if you're an advocate for Pascal's Wager, being unconcerned with evidential arguments and more concerned with evaluating any conceivable risk, you should argue for the worship of the god specifically crafted for this wager, the god of Pascalianism.  Or, you know, you could realize that arguments like this, which are entirely unconcerned with the basis of their premises, fail to make any valuable point.  I want to shout out a friend of mine who is the creator and pope of Pascalianism, He's Cosmological on YouTube and at CosmologicalYT on Twitter.  He made a video about Pascal's Wager a couple years ago where he made the case for Pascalianism, and I just thought it was hilarious and brilliant.  He doesn't make videos anymore, although I wish that he would start back up, but he is still on Twitter and is one of my favorite people to follow.  Give him a follow.  The link to his Twitter is in the description.  I don't think you'll regret it.  Why did God create animals with the ability to feel pain?  This question delves into a bit of theology that all Abrahamics share.  God made animals with pain receptors.  Many animals, especially the kinds we eat the most, can feel physical pain in exactly the same way as humans.  Many of those animals can and do suffer psychological trauma just like humans as well.  Yet, God not only condones people killing and eating animals, but he created animals with the capacity to suffer while already knowing full well that they would.  Then, for a long period in history, he demanded humans to slaughter and sacrifice animals to him just because he enjoyed the act of devotion.  This direct encouragement of the suffering of the innocent is entirely inconsistent with a tri-omni nature.  If God couldn't create a food cycle for all creatures that didn't include suffering, then he isn't omnipotent.  If he didn't know the system would lead to suffering, he isn't omniscient.  Now, if he could have done better, if he could have made a food cycle that didn't promote suffering but chose not to, He's not only lacking in omnibenevolence, but I would argue, he's a sadist.  Of course, there's another explanation for this issue.  Maybe God had nothing to do with the formation of the food chain, and humans just made up a myth that morally justified killing animals so they could keep doing it without internal moral conflict.  Whether you're a believer in the Abrahamic God or not, you probably already know that people in many religions outside of yours tend to have doctrine that morally justifies actions which seem immoral but allow that group to better survive or propagate.  If you are a believer in this tri-omni God, maybe it's time to realize that believers before you likely made up these logically inconsistent ideas within your doctrine too.  Why doesn't God just create people in heaven and skip the trial period of earth?  This question comes from my friend and fellow atheist YouTuber Paula Gia, so Paul, I hope that I do this question justice for you.  If you haven't checked out his channel, please do it.  His content is simply excellent through and through.  I've been on it.  Pretty much every major atheist YouTuber that's even active now has been on it.  It's great stuff.  You won't regret it.  Links in the description.  Okay, so, if God is omnipotent, he knows, out of all the people he creates, who would choose to believe in him and follow him while on earth.  He also supposedly doesn't want people to suffer, and only wants people to believe in him and follow him.  However, God allows people who choose him to suffer while on earth, and much worse, he creates people that he knows will not choose him while on earth, and those people end up suffering in hell.  There's an inconsistency there.  If he's actually omnibenevolent, why would he not exclusively create people who would choose to follow him if they were put on earth and then send them directly to heaven, skipping the suffering of earth entirely?  If your answer to this question is along the lines of having free will and the capacity to suffer is better than lacking free will and not suffering, then you've just hurt the case for your doctrine.  That answer implies that the people who would be created in heaven would not have free will, and that people in heaven right now don't have free will.  If a life with free will and suffering is better than one without free will or suffering, then that means that earth must be better than heaven.  So, free will can't be the answer to this question.  We once again face the problem of evil.  If God couldn't exclusively create people in heaven, he isn't omnipotent.  If he didn't know his creation of humans on earth would lead to suffering, he isn't omniscient.  If he could create people in heaven but won't, he isn't omnibenevolent.  As always though, there is another option.  Maybe this idea of God is simply nonsensical.  The truth is, the concept of a tri-omni-God falls apart immediately under anything more than momentary consideration.  To me, it seems that there's a notion out there that this kind of God is the most obvious, or most likely, the default idea of God.  The only reason this absurd idea of a deity is so prevalent today is because of the often genocidal physical and cultural conquest of Abrahamic faiths, especially in the West.  Just because it's perhaps the most prevalent idea of God where you are, don't think it's the hardest to counter.  After all, how powerful is a god, really, when their nature falls apart at the sound of a few simple questions?  Okay, I usually just pin a question in my comments, but I really wanted to ask on camera this time.  What weird questions have you come up with that reveal holes in God's supposed nature?  It doesn't have to be exclusively about the Abrahamic concept of a god.  I'm really interested to hear what you guys have come up with, because if you can't tell, this is a very intriguing topic for me personally.
