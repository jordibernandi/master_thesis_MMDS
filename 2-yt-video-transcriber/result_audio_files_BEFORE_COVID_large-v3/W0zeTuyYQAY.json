            "text": "nofap 2020 every day.  what's up guys?  it's young man's daily red pill.  back another video and today's video.  i'm going to be sharing why i'm starting the nofap 2020 journey and i'm going to be working on nofap throughout the entirety of this year.  if you're new to my channel my channel is mainly on helping young men such as myself well around my age range find the red pill and self-actualize so you can become the greatest version of yourself and unlock true potential.  Now we're gonna be diving into some of the six benefits of NoFap that I've noticed over the last six months that I've started.  The first thing that I really noticed was like, definitely I had stronger erections when I did have erections.  I was at the point in high school when I was like, I had like a little girlfriend in high school and basically like, Like all high schoolers, we would have sex all the time and I couldn't get up sometimes because I was just constantly draining my seed.  My seed was constantly being spilled and all my energy was being depleted from my sack, you know what I'm saying?  So I had no energy left.  to keep a strong erection most of the time because I was having sex constantly.  Even though my testosterone was probably at its peak highest when I was in high school, I mean, it is pretty, it's still hella high right now, but I'm saying, like, you're still developing at that age, and it was at its peak highest.  I was still struggling to keep a hard erection.  It was an erection, but it was like a little flop.  It was low-key flop, you know what I'm saying?  Like, it wouldn't work all the time.  But I definitely noticed since starting the NoFap journey that my erections have become... fucking solid as fuck guys hella solid and that's one of the main benefits i've noticed.  i also had morning erections now.  uh not to get too like make you guys feel too uncomfortable but i definitely have stronger erections in the morning.  sometimes i'll even it'll carry on into like when i get out of bed which is crazy because i never had that before.  like sometimes i have to be conscious of how i pee and shit.  you know what i'm saying.  so it's like.  uh i don't know.  i've never experienced this kind of because i was always um constantly spilling my seed uh depleting my energy and my sacraments resources.  but uh that's one of the main things i noticed.  the second thing i noticed was i really became like less thirsty uh especially over the past year i've really become less thirsty like i'll go into the gym and at first my first daughter nofap.  I swear, guys, it was so hard.  I was literally, like, I was so thirsty, guys, especially after, like, week one and week two.  I was just like, oh, my God, like, I just want to fuck something, you know?  But, like, I was just like, you just got to, like, get over that mentally, you know?  It's hard.  It's challenging.  But it's a good mental exercise.  It's good practice to self-discipline within your mind.  And it helps you actually grow as a man.  I've come to realize because life isn't all about, like, fucking, you know?  It isn't.  Like, I know it feels really good and shit, but quite frankly, you have a better chance of just, like, not doing that shit and picking up women than being a thirsty motherfucker that just walks around wanting to fuck everything.  Because in the end, you're not going to fuck anything.  Except your fucking hand.  That's just facts.  The third thing I noticed was I got way better sleep.  I got, like, I mean, a ton of better sleep, guys.  I was able to sleep throughout the night.  Before, when I was fapping every day, not only was I, like, kind of low-key, like, fapping, like, in the sheets, and it was, like, nasty.  Sorry, I'm just being hella honest with you guys.  Like, I was kind of a dirty motherfucker, like, a long time ago.  But... I had better sleep in general.  I was able to sleep throughout the entirety of the night.  I'm talking about 8-9 hours a night of pure sleep.  I was in my REM stages of sleep not waking up at all which felt great and I hadn't experienced that quite frankly ever.  I mean, maybe when I was a little, little kid, but as soon as I learned how to beat my meat, I was just beating my meat every single day, you know, spilling my seed, and I just couldn't get the highest quality of sleep, and I would actually use it to help me go to sleep.  That's a bad idea, too.  Don't do that shit.  It's disgusting.  It's really fucking disgusting.  Don't do that.  It's quite shameful actually.  The fourth thing I've noticed is healthy skin.  I've had a lot healthier skin since I stopped beating my meat.  My skin has completely cleared up.  I used to have acne back in high school.  I can show you guys some pictures if you really wanted to, but I used to have acne.  I might still have a little bit of pock marks in my skin right here, but I don't know if you guys can tell, but I did have acne and it has definitely gone away.  I've been able to grow more facial hair since I've also stopped beating my meat.  And that's a part of my journey as well.  I'm starting to grow a beard as I feel like it's also another journey I can accomplish in my life, can complete, can work towards.  Because I'm trying to really encourage you guys to work towards things in your life.  Even if it's just growing a beard or it's just not masturbating or practicing nofap or whatever it is.  You're going to get to that destination eventually.  You just got to keep pushing and pushing and pushing guys.  And I'm sure you'll get there one day.  Clear skin is actually one of the first things that people notice about you too.  I had a lot of people tell me like, whoa, like your skin looks a lot better, especially my mom.  It also might have to do with me drinking a gallon and a half of water a day because that's what I've been doing as well.  Shout out to Seth is cold for putting me onto that.  But I've been drinking a gallon of water a day, also moisturizing my face, taking better care of myself.  But I truly believe that beating your meat and draining your resources from your sack, like I said before, it gets rid of those nutrients that are healthy for your skin and replenish the skin and the hair follicles that can help you grow a beard as well.  Second to last tip guys is a clear thoughts.  All right, you have clear thoughts and your mind is completely free of stress of anxiety.  You don't always have to think about beating your meat, you know, because that's like what a lot of like when you're constantly beating your meat.  That's kind of what you always think about and you're kind of always just in that thirsty like beta mindset of just like when can I rub one out?  like you're hella thirsty and horny, you know, so it's just like a grind me feeling it's not really who you're meant to be.  you're putting sex ahead of yourself when you should be focusing on yourself and working hard at becoming uh being on your purpose and really truly finding out the man you're supposed to become.  clearer thoughts also allowed me to want to create this channel and like put out videos every single day.  it's just inspired me.  having clear thoughts also like will help you in school because i'm in college right now and it definitely has helped me with my class work and like listening to the teacher and my professors understanding the information.  You're not constantly thinking about sex and you're not thirsting over women.  You're more so just in your own energy and you're focusing on what you can do to be self-improvement, how you can improve your quality of life.  Because that's all that matters really in the end guys.  is self-improving yourself.  You should never put your penis in your own satisfaction of rubbing one out over your quality of life.  So having clear thoughts is definitely something that I would say has been a benefit from this NoFap journey.  Next up we have work ethic.  So my work ethic has completely gone up.  since nofap.  I've noticed a huge increase in my work ethic and That has been like one of the main reasons why I created this channel and I wanted to share my journey with you guys As well as like the red pill and what I've learned from going my own way and becoming alpha.  when you stop beating your meat I swear to God guys.  I swear to God.  look me in the eye.  Your work ethic will skyrocket and I mean it will skyrocket guys.  I I created this channel and literally I've been motivated to post every single day.  Even though I don't have the biggest following right now, I can already see the end result in my mind.  I've been reading books every day.  I've been just growing my mind, meditating.  You know what I'm saying?  I've been growing my mind spiritually, physically, mentally.  I've been becoming the greatest version of myself.  And I'm becoming self-reflective and self-actualizing myself because I've taken away all that energy that was being depleted when I was busting gallons of nuts.  and putting it towards something that matters which is myself and what i want to accomplish in life and the message i want to share with you guys that are watching because that's what i believe my true purpose is on this earth.  so your work ethic will increase tremendously guys.  your work ethic will increase and you want to be on your purpose as much as you can be.  there's not.  there's never enough hours in the day that you feel like you can't be working on something or getting better at something something that inspires you or taking up a new type of skill.  because that's what I've started to do with this channel and just in life in general you really start to become aware of what your purpose is and it's not so wrapped around just beating your meat and women and dating because really all that matters is you and focusing on yourself Focusing on becoming the best version of yourself and increasing your work ethic each day so you can improve from the man you were 24 hours ago and the man that you are going to become in 24 hours from now is even better than the one that was 24 hours ago.  You know what I'm saying?  So become the best version of yourself.  by stop beating your meat, putting your priorities straight.  These are just some of the six things that I noticed.  My goal is to document every single day of 2020 and share with you guys a little bit about this journey, this NoFap journey.
