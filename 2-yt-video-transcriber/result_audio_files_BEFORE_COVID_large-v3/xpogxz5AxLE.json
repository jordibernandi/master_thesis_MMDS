So, so sweet.  If you listen carefully, you can almost hear them crying in the distance.  Anyway, for today's video, we'll be reacting to two things.  Firstly, some other Flat Earth channels have made videos regarding this black hole image of Messier87.  Second, Jake the Flat Earther has responded to me.  You know, the guy who I responded to in my previous video.  So we're going to be briefly looking at that.  To start off, we have Jarenism here attempting to make an analogy between black holes and gnar holes, which is a made-up concept. ",

And you'd have to, dun dun, rely on the words of authority.  As inconvenient as this may sound, it's very obvious why you aren't able to produce an image of a black hole yourself.  You don't have the technology to do so.  Perhaps if you had the money to buy a bunch of massive telescopes situated around the Earth and knew the computer skills to translate radio waves, then maybe you would be able to.  Actually, no, you wouldn't.  You'd still need a lot of things, including an education.  This stuff is overly advanced for regular people, much less flat earthers.  And, you know, it's not like NASA were the ones to do this.  Sure, they helped out with their spacecrafts at some point, but the team was composed of the Event Horizon Telescope Imaging Team.  Katie Bowman, for example, is a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard.  You know, the girl who became an internet meme.  The point is, there was a massive team of scientists who worked on this and weren't part of NASA.  To think that a conspiracy can be this big and still be maintained is an outlandish idea.  But it's not like this type of work is entirely closed off to the public.  Scientists are just regular people, just like you and me.  They got to their position through hard work.  Anyone could be in that position.  You don't need to be some government employee or NASA agent.  Anyone could have been there to work on the black hole imaging. ",

Literally in the same clip, she says, the image is actually light that is produced by plasma around the black hole.  It's clear that you seem to know nothing about black holes since you don't know the concept behind imaging it.  You can't directly observe the black hole because it absorbs all electromagnetic radiation.  But you can see the light around the black hole and how it bends to conform to the black hole's gravity.  That's basically what it is.  So when scientists image the black hole, sure, it's not the black hole itself, but it's still, you know, the black hole.

Black holes have been mathematically calculated and indirectly observed to exist.  Sure, we couldn't be 100% certain of their existence through that alone, which is why the recent image was so important because it confirmed that concept.  But the point is, there's nothing like that for gnar holes.  No mathematical calculations, no observations, nothing.  Meanwhile, black holes had an entire field of physics revolve around it.

The technology wasn't there, and there weren't any special effects or anything back then as well, so the shadows couldn't have been produced by computer editing.
