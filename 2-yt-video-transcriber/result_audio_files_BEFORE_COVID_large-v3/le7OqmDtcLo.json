            "text": "The concept of Marxism is one that I find troublesome.  In physics, for example, there's nothing like Einsteinism.  because Einstein isn't a god who you worship.  Rather, he's a human being who had important things to say, and like every other human being, made mistakes.  So you learn from what he had to say, and you disregard his mistakes.  Now, Marxism, the concept, in my view, belongs to the history of organized religion.  It's a kind of worship of an individual that makes no sense.  If you look at Marx himself and other people who've been working in that tradition, you learn what's valuable, you disregard what's wrong.  And then after that, we just go and look.  So, for example, take, say, socialism.  Marx had almost nothing to say about it.  I mean, if you read, I'm not a great Marx specialist, but as far as I understand, and I've read a fair amount, there are a few scattered sentences in Marx's writings about socialism.  He's a theorist of capitalism.  He was a theorist, basically, of 19th century capitalism, perfectly naturally.  And he developed sort of an abstract model of the capitalist system and its properties, from which I think there's a lot to learn.  And any intelligent person should read it and learn what you can from it, as you learn from others.  To assume that it offers a doctrine for today Makes no sense.  I can't imagine that Marx would have believed that.  He also wrote important things about the contemporary affairs, for example, about the British and Indies.  Certainly worth reading, but if we were still repeating those things now, civilization would be dead.  You know, we should have learned something in the last hundred years.  So, yes, there's contributions, as there is from the rest of our cultural tradition.  And you learn from them what's important, and you disregard what's not useful. ",
