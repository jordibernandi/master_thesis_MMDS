There is the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow laws.  We don't owe the homeless.  We don't owe feminists.  We don't owe women who are desirous of having abortions, or gays who want to get married to one another.  That's what civil rights has become for much of the left. ",

            "text": "you cannot have both.  the clip that you just heard my more brothers was ann coulter talking about how the democrats accurately the democrats and they actually said it out of their mouths were dumping black people and moving on.  This was seven years ago in the midst of President Obama.  And they were basically unabashedly saying that they wanted to include immigrants in civil rights.  In other words, they want to, or they wanted to, and they actually did give the immigrants rights that black people fought for.  And as hard as it is for me to agree with Ann Coulter, actually, I don't disagree with Ann Coulter a lot.  A lot of stuff that flies out of her mouth is accurate.  A lot of stuff that flies out of her mouth is actually accurate.  We might disagree with her, might disagree with her point of view, but I have to give her credit.  She does do her research.  Like she says, We don't owe a debt to homeless folks.  I mean, you do because in a certain way you need to take care of your homeless people.  They're your citizens.  But you don't owe a debt to white women that want to get an abortion or white women that want to get equity and pay with their white men.  Because trust and believe, when your feminists talk about pay equity and the pay gap, they never mention black men in the pay gap.  Even when black women talk about The pay gap.  They don't talk about the pay gap between them and black men.  They talk about the pay gap between them and white men because white men are the gold standard.  In fact, neither one of them actually even mentioned you, even though it was your bodies that got out there and fought for civil rights.  It was your bodies that got burned, lynched, bitten by dogs, hung, you know, disappeared.  They actually did the groundwork.  And it was your shackles that and your change that the debt is owed to.  And I have to agree with Ann Coulter.  Ann Coulter said a few things.  She said something to Tariq Masheed that civil rights are for black people.  And immigrants, you know, when they get to this country, how about self-deportation?  Were we supposed to roll out the welcome mat so that the kids that are born elsewhere could come in and access the same rights and privileges that were supposed to be afforded to black people?  to make them whole.  If black people were made whole, if black people were kicking ass and they're right up there with the Asians and they were rip roaring and they had their families were intact and there was full employment in the black community, I would have no problem with the immigrants coming in and accessing, you know, the, I wouldn't say the leftovers, but the, the overabundance of wealth that the United States has to offer.  I have no problem with it.  Immigrants want to come in and make their way.  They're allowed in.  I had no problem with them making their way and contributing to the society.  But to give them unearned rights, to give them unearned access that we can't, to allow them to replace the black citizens that had been here that helped build this country from the beginning, not even by their own will, by force.  America created us.  They owe a debt to us.  Like when I had my children, I had to feed, clothe, and house my children.  Had to send them to school.  Had to sit up and do homework with them.  Had to make sure that they get their education and make sure that they get a good start in life.  Now, they were neighborhood children.  Now, did the neighborhood children come in and play the video games that my children were playing?  Well, sure they did.  Did they come in and sit at the table and eat at my table?  Yeah, they sure did.  When I took my children to basketball games, to park rec basketball games, put them on teams, did I go by and pick up their teammates?  Did I feed them?  Yeah, I did.  But my children didn't have to stand by When I bought a pizza and watch all the other kids eat most of the pizza and they can only get a slice.  No, my kids ate first.  My kids didn't sit in the back seat while I picked up their teammates or I picked up other kids from the neighborhood.  My kids sat in the front seat.  My kids were not last at the table when it came time to eat.  I didn't give away shoes to the neighborhood and my kids are barefooted.  I didn't tutor other people's children when my own child could not read.  It doesn't work that way.  Just like every other country, they take care of their own first.  Like it or not, black folks, ADOS are children of America.  We were here when this country was founded.  In fact, this country was founded on the backs of our ancestors.  America would not be America without the importation of slaves.  They brought us in, they bred us, they created a whole class.  And every time they bring in immigrants, they send them to our neighborhoods.  We are tired of being the stepping stone for every other group.  Starting off like a starter initiation into America.  We're going to send you to the ghetto so that you can advance yourself forward.  But what happens to the people in the ghetto?  Do the immigrants go back to the ghetto and reach back and bring those people out?  Do they go back and teach?  Do they give scholarships to the neighborhoods that they started in?  No, they don't.  And for most immigrants, we don't expect them to.  The immigrants don't owe us a debt.  Our country does.  And I don't blame the conservative white people.  I don't blame the rednecks when they talk about immigrants.  I don't mind immigrants coming in.  I don't mind an immigration policy.  But immigrants do not have the right to access the same things that our country agreed with us to get.  We sat at the table.  We negotiated.  We protested.  We ironed out a bargain between us and our country.  We'll do this if you give us that.  Quid pro quo.  Now, how are other people getting allowed to come in?  Never been here.  Never sat at the table.  Just allowed to be.  OK, we're going to make them your newly minted Negro.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Doesn't work that way.  They didn't make the deal with you.  We can't go down to Mexico or Guatemala and say we demand rights.  We demand welfare.  We demand jobs and houses and stuff like that.  And we demand to be treated just like any other Mexican or Guatemalan or Haitian or South African or Ghanaian.  And we just landed there.  Like I said, I don't mind.  If we have abundance, we share.  Black people have always shared.  We have abundance, we share.  Even when we don't have abundance, we share.  But when we're talking to our government that's supposed to work for us, that hammered out a deal to correct the past misgivings of our government toward our group, toward the group that they formed, the class that they made.  And because it's politically expedient, that's a growing political class and you want political power, you're just going to toss us under the bus and try to get a new group in and expect us not to say something.  Where do they do that at?  That's all I got to say.  With that, I'm going to jump off of here.  This is BGS out, and I will see you guys on the next one. ",
