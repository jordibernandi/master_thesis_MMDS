I have no idea what he's talking about since non-disclosure agreements are perfectly legal in the law, and they involve no violations of law.  The president paid for these out of his own pocket.  It did not involve a campaign contribution.  So I have no idea what he's going to testify to.  The guy's a liar.  He's a screwball.  He's obviously squirrely and a worm.

But as far as the underlying case, this is an example of why special counsels are a very bad idea.  certainly a bad idea with somebody like bob muller who you know shows up at the office doesn't do anything and leave it in the hands of a bunch of democrats.  i mean i i do think the stone case is ridiculous to be.  you'll you'll notice there's no proof that he did anything wrong other other than that the allegations concerning these process crimes.  by the way i'd i don't favor process cries.  i think they should be prosecuted but in this case I find it hard to believe that everything he's accused of happened, but he'll have a chance to defend it.

So, therefore, McCabe discussing them the way he did by discussing the substance of what he told them is, in fact, a violation of the regs.  It could be a violation of the Espionage Act.  It could be a violation of mishandling of classified information.  It could be a purposeful disclosure.  Make no mistake about it.  Andrew McCabe, by publishing his book and making these appearances, has in essence given the people a signed confession that he engaged in a coup d'etat, in a legal usurpation of the functions of the Constitution and of Congress.  This guy has done more to help the President of the United States by describing his unconstitutional illegal conduct than anybody in this sorry scheme.
