            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we turn to talking about those DNA ancestry tests, which everyone is taking nowadays.  For better or worse, this new trend is revealing a lot about people and their families and their beliefs.  I actually remember South Park joking about this too, a couple seasons ago.  Remember that time Randy Marsh wanted to get a test done to prove he was part Native American?  Which he got the idea from from a commercial that was a parody saying, get your DNA test done to find out how much of a victim you are.  And well, Randy tried to sway his DNA test too by making out with a Native American before taking his oral swab.  Pretty hilarious.  And now, years later, American politician Elizabeth Warren probably wishes she would have done something like that too.  To make her look more native on her own DNA test which came out a few months ago.  If you don't remember, just a while back, Elizabeth Warren, an American politician, well, she tried to prove she was in fact part Native American too, since she had been called out recently for faking being Native American for many years in order to get into college and lawyer bar exams and get herself some victim points too.  And well, all Elizabeth Warren really did was actually expose the fact that she wasn't very Native American at all, like one one-thousandth of a Native, which turned out to be very embarrassing for her, to say the least.  And today we're going to go over another YouTuber who had a surprise with her own DNA test.  A YouTuber named Nia Hope recently read her African ancestry test results live in a video on her YouTube channel.  And needless to say, things did not turn out like she expected.  She even ended up crying a bit and getting very upset when the results were far different than what she thought she was going to get.  And this really reminds me of that time a few years ago when Lauren Southern did about the same thing with her own test.  Lauren took a DNA test on her own channel too.  And back then, upon reading her results, Lauren started freaking out because she was part Spanish for some reason.  That video is long gone now though, as far as I know, but we still got Nia Hope's video around here today.  So let's go ahead and take a look and see what happens with her test. ",

I just saw That my results came in the mail and as soon as I saw this package, I legit like, I lost my mind a little bit.  I was on Instagram showing this off.  It's clearly unopened. ",

            "text": "Well, she sounds a little too excited if you ask me.  I might be interested in my background maybe, but it would hardly be something that would elate or excite me this much to this degree.  And did you notice how she said she got her African results back?  Sounds like she already has some preconceptions about what's going to be in those results then.  I mean, it's not a giant leap for a blackish looking woman to think they have ancestors from Africa, but it looks like Nia is already settled in on the fact that she's from there for sure.  And it looks like this test is just to find out what part of Africa she's actually from.  And well, with great expect-. ",
