I can barely take care of myself and I do not have the energy to fight these people.  And I was retroactively reinstated and I only had to pay the 29.50 a month from when they canceled my insurance without my knowledge. ",

But The last time I saw you, I will take that, that I will take.  Okay.  The last time I saw John, it was not a good circumstance.  We had a brief conversation.  And I'm so happy that working with your senators in our office, we were able to rectify your situation.  Let me just say this, not just to John.  As a nation, we can disagree about a war.  We can disagree about foreign policy.  But when brave people like John put their lives on the line to defend our country, when they come home, they will receive the best quality healthcare that this country can provide them.  And they will not have to go deeply in debt or be harassed by bill collectors for some stupid bureaucratic reason.  So, John, thank you so much. ",
