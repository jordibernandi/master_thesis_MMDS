            "text": "Hi, my name's Phil, and I like talking about politics.  And in this video, I'd like to talk about some potentially exciting news.  I only say potentially, and it'll become clear, because there may well be a plan that even if Boris Johnson gets away with proroguing Parliament, and that has yet to be seen, may finish him off completely and finish off the concept of a no-deal Brexit.  But first, if you find yourself enjoying the video, then please click the like button and subscribe to the channel.  so on friday just before i was going off for the weekend i saw a little bit of news which at first looked really exciting and then i thought but can we be sure of it?  so i'm going to explain that first of all.  then i saw some news over the weekend that made me think actually this is possibly real.  certainly boris johnson thinks it is because he's running scared right now and what it may mean as well.  so Gordon Brown, who is a former prime minister, so he's not in frontline politics right now, he was saying that he'd been talking to EU leaders and that they were ready to remove the deadline, the Article 50 deadline.  Now, at first when I read that, I thought, oh, what do they mean?  Do they mean just massively extend it?  Or do they mean get rid of it altogether?  Can they do it?  Obviously, they alone can't do it.  It's the whole EU Council that would agree to this.  That includes the UK.  But obviously, we know Parliament's in favour of it.  So it's just a case of whether you can bypass Boris Johnson.  But first of all, was it just massively extending it or was it getting rid of it altogether?  Because I have to say, when this is all done and dusted, however Brexit finishes up, when it's all done and dusted, it wouldn't surprise me if the EU decided to take another look at Article 50.  I think Article 50 was hastily arranged because everyone just looked at it and thought, well, we have to have some way of leaving the EU.  But at the end of the day, who's going to be mad enough to actually leave the EU?  Yes, Oz.  So... Because... This thing about the default being that you just leave with no deal if no one can agree anything just sounds a bit mad.  If the member state that wishes to leave wishes to leave with no deal, well, that's fine.  Their parliament can vote for that if they're mad enough.  But even our parliament isn't mad enough for that.  So, but anyway, the fact of the matter is you have to have an extension.  I think what he was talking about was just removing the October 31st extension.  Remember, when we were first of all getting this extension, a lot of the member states, a lot of the members of the council just wanted a right long extension, a year, maybe more.  It was France that put its foot down there.  Oh, President Macron there.  And the reason is believed to be this.  The European elections were coming up and he wanted to look as if he was being tough on the UK.  So he put his foot down and said six month extension.  That's no longer necessary anymore.  He no longer is all that tied to an October 31st deadline.  So what Gordon Brown is suggesting is that people he's talked to, and he didn't say President Macron himself, he just said people.  And this is where, you know, he's saying that they're after removing that.  And I think they remain removing it as in putting another six months onto it.  Now, of course, Boris Johnson is, you know, he'd be our representative technically on the council, is the one who would have to go along and ask for it.  And my fear was always that he'll go along and say the words, but be so rude that other member states wouldn't give it to him.  But if member states next week, and Gordon Brown is suggesting this will happen next week, if they next week just offer it, without an EU council meeting, you know, without the summit meeting, which isn't till October anyway, if they just offer it, obviously the UK has to agree to it.  But if the offer is made, Parliament can vote on it.  Parliament will vote, yes, please.  Thank you very much.  And then it's done.  There is no October the 31st deadline.  The deadline would be for what?  You know, April or. ",
