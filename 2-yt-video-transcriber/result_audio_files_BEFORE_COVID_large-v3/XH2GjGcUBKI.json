The news division was there, but it atrophied compared to what the entertainment side was doing.  And the lesson that Democrats need to understand is that long before the World Wide Web started, by the way, the first presidential election with the World Wide Web was 96.  This is still pretty new stuff.  Ten years later, from the first web pages, then we had the first president elected by Cambridge Analytica and Facebook instead of by the electorate.  So understanding digital is incredibly important in media.  Understanding the difference between opinion and ideology and fact is incredibly important.  And then comes the difference in a two-party system, which is what we've got.  That's not what the Constitution envisioned.  We've had over 100 parties on presidential ballots over the course of this country's lifetime.  So we can have more than two parties.  But in a two-party system, when one party loses its way, Our entire system breaks down.  The Republicans have lost their way, helping to elect and now helping to serve a president who is neither a Republican nor a Democrat, although he ran for president once as a Reform Party candidate.  making a lie to his original origin story that he was not a politician and had never run for office.
