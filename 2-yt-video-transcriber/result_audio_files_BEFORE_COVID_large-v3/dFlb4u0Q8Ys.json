Boy, they left as soon as I got the camera out, didn't they?  What's that?  They left as soon as I got that camera out, didn't they?  Yeah, why'd they do that?  I don't know.  They don't like me filming them.  Oh, you film them all the time?  Yes, sir.  I appreciate that.  Yes, sir.  That's good work.  Yep.  Now they're parked in the parking lot over here.  They're gonna try and find out where I'm parked.  Fuck it, I'll show them right where my car is.  I'm over here.  Over here.  I'll fucking show them right where my truck, my car's parked.
