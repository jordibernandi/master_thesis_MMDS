            "text": "Thank you.  hey family hope you guys are having a great Wednesday morning.  wanted to hop on here and bring someone to your attention today.  I don't know if you guys know about him but his name is Sebastian Kurz and oddly enough this man won the elections in Austria on Rosh Hashanah.  okay And so I'll go ahead and tell you guys, we're not looking for the Antichrist.  We're looking for the return of Jesus.  But we keep our eyes on things because all of these things point to Jesus' return.  But I want to bring a couple things to your attention today about this guy.  He is really raising some eyebrows.  So his name is, like I said, Sebastian Kurtz.  He wins the elections in Austria on Rosh Hashanah.  and then just oddly enough shows up in Israel on the Feast of Trumpets, right?  So, sorry, there's this, hold on, guys, there's this glare.  I think it's coming off of this mirror here.  Okay.  That's weird.  It's like putting this gray thing on my head.  Anyways, so the guy is not married.  And another crazy thing that he's 33 years old.  everybody knows that Jesus was 33 when he saved us when he died on the cross.  so you know I will never say that someone is in fact for sure the Antichrist but there's a lot of things about this guy that is really raising some brows.  So he's 33 years old.  So, you know, um, you know, the antichrist or, or, or Satan wants to mock everything, uh, that Jesus does and, and, and wants to duplicate it, uh, replicate it.  So isn't it kind of crazy?  33 years old, you know, you know, coming to power as their Messiah at 33 years old.  You know what I'm saying?  It's kind of crazy, a little weird.  Uh, he's not married.  Um, watched a video that Christina had sent me and about 10 minutes in he he's talking about peace and security in the Middle East and he's talking about a two-state solution would be the best solution.  he's also talking about the protection of Israel and the Jews.  Also, in November of 2017, he nominated himself under the People's Party, and then he basically rose to power.  Another thing that Christina told me about was that He apparently has a higher IQ than most people, so he's really smart.  He's very good at speaking English.  We know that the Antichrist will be from the revived Roman Empire.  He's from Austria.  Austria is a part of the European Union.  So there's a lot of, just a lot of things are really raising my eyebrows about this guy.  Another crazy thing, and I'm just throwing it in there, I don't know if you guys saw Left Behind, but the man that played the Antichrist and Sebastian look identical.  Let me show you guys, this is crazy.  that not wild.  he looks just like him.  you know God speaks in all types of different ways.  do you think that he was trying to tell us something you know when this movie was made you think he was trying to get our attention?  I don't know.  all I'm saying is Israel.  right now, they can't seem to get it together.  They can't seem to get somebody to form a government.  They don't have anybody in power.  This guy kind of shows up, you know, hey, I got the answers kind of thing.  I don't know.  I'm just saying, guys.  So, keep your eye out for this guy.  I just, I really think that, you know, I think time is up, just like Jesus showed me.  So, you know, when time is exactly up, we don't know.  That's why we keep watching.  So, just wanted to bring Sebastian to your attention today.  Hope you guys are having a great day, and I'll talk to you later. ",
