            "text": "Real men don't care how they look.  How many of you guys have ever heard that before?  Yeah.  So there's so many things that tie into this.  And this is one of the biggest and dumbest myths in the world.  This is one of the things, I love talking about this one on Twitter, which, at Tanner Guzzi, you guys can follow me there.  Men historically in every culture at any point in history have always used our appearance and particularly our clothing to express our masculinity and use it as ways to gauge things like courage, strength, mastery, honor, stuff like Jack Donovan talks about as the tactical virtues.  Use it to signal things like status or fitness or accomplishments or anything else.  I want you to look at these kinds of photos and tell me that these men wearing these things don't care how they look.  It's a preposterous idea.  Men always have and always will care about the way that they look.  Now, this lie is rooted in a couple of different things, and the biggest one is kind of this uniquely American idea that real men don't care what anybody else thinks of them, right?  We hear that one a lot, too.  You know, if you're a real man, you just do your own thing, and it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks, which really, you're just describing a sociopath, if you say that.  If you really don't care what anybody else thinks about you at all, you have a problem.  And so we see this, but then the problem is, is the world tells us that we have to, we're given a false dichotomy.  It's either I'm a sociopath and I don't care what anybody thinks, or welcome to a global society where everybody's opinion has to matter to me.  It's a false dichotomy.  None of those is the right answer.  What matters is that the opinion of the right people matters to you.  You look at these kind of men, and I guarantee you that this guy doesn't care what that guy thinks of him.  They're not the same tribe.  They're not the same part of the world.  They don't have shared goals.  They don't have shared beliefs.  They don't care.  But these guys care what each other thinks.  These guys care what each other thinks.  Right?  There is nothing wrong and everything right with caring what other men think of you.  But they have to earn the right for their opinion to matter to you.  And when they do, then you have to maintain that loyalty and maintain that honor within them.  And one of the ways to do that is by caring about the way that you look.  Right?  This is absolutely one of those things that, and you'll hear it over and over and over again.  Real men don't care.  Real men absolutely care.  Honor is one of those things that matters.  And for you men who are trying to do something more, my family, my wife, my kids, their opinion matters to me.  They've earned that right.  A lot of the speakers here, guys that I've known for years, their opinions matter to me.  I've got clients here.  Their opinions matter to me.  You guys, way more so than somebody else who's just staying in the hotel.  Your opinions have started to matter to me.  That's a good thing.  Embrace that and recognize that if somebody... is basing their opinion on you based on the way that you look, that you either need to determine, one, if they already do matter and if their opinions matter, or two, if their opinions have the potential for mattering.  If you're going in for a job interview or you run your own business and you're looking to talk to a potential client, you better believe their opinion matters to you, right?  Otherwise, you're not getting the job or you're not getting the sale.  Some idiot on the street or some YouTube, I can already tell you.  I can already see the YouTube comments because it's happened every year that I've been here.  This dude's going to talk about style?  Look at that stupid suit.  Why would anybody wear something like that?  Every time, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter what I wear.  It really doesn't matter.  And that's another thing you guys need to embrace.  Because one of the other reasons why we tell ourselves that real men don't care how they look is because we're just trying to play it safe.  We're just trying to make it so that we're not polarizing and we're really just trying to play not to lose as opposed to trying to play to win.  And I'll tell you guys, the only way to not be judged based on your appearance is to not be noticed.  Right, it really is.  It's the only way to not be judged is to just not be noticed.  And sadly, that's what the majority of men do when it comes to their clothing.  They just think, well, I'm just going to put on whatever is comfortable.  Because you know what?  If somebody really didn't care about how he looked, he'd be raiding his wife's closet.  He'd be happy to wear her clothes.  It wouldn't matter, right?  Dress, tights, whatever.  I don't care.  I'll put on whatever I want.  Exactly, we can hear how comical that is, but it's a pretty lie that he tells himself, because he knows that he's trying to avoid this, and so all he's doing is playing not to lose.  I only care to the extent that I don't look like an idiot, because then if I have to actually, whoa, if I actually have to take a social risk, and people might think that I look stupid for what I'm, I can't handle that.  What if my friends make fun of me?  What if the people at work actually make a comment?  What if I screw up and I wear something that's wrong?  And it's kind of silly to think that we're scared of that, but a lot of men really are.  It's not a physical risk, but there's a social risk that comes with that.  That's why we call guys who do start to change their style, oh, he's trying too hard.  Oh, what a poser.  What happened to you, Ted?  You changed.  whatever, those are the kind of guys who are just going to continue in every regard in their lives to play not to lose as opposed to playing to win.  And so, yes, you can care about how you look.  You should care about how you look.  Your life will get better as you care about how you look.  And you gauge that properly, both within your own self-perception and the way the people who matter to you or have the potential to matter to you will react to the way that you look.  Everybody else, they don't matter.  You don't have to worry about it with them.  Thank you. ",
