            "text": "This is High Desert Community Watch in the city of Hesperia.  Just got a tag on Facebook about a local story about two or three sheriffs, deputies who are blowing the whistle on the impound scheme here in our local cities that the cops had in impounding people's cars.  Illegally.  And I just got tagged on it this morning on my way to work.  Well, I just happened to be working like about four blocks from the Hesperia Police Department.  So I figured I'd come in and do a little audit for the story.  He's going in the gate right now.  Yeah, I'm walking as the gates open so I can film what's inside.  He stopped in the driveway and is just looking at me.  Yeah.  I don't wish to talk, sir.  No, no, come here.  Hey, let me explain something to you.  Come here.  Let me explain something to you.  No, thank you.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  I'm expressing my First Amendment, right?  No, I get that.  All I want to do is talk to you.  I'm afraid of cops, bro.  You guys are unpredictable.  I'm just Stephanie Johnston.  I know, but you have weapons and stuff on you.  We have security issues.  I'm on the sidewalk.  SB 411, bro.  I'm on the sidewalk.  It doesn't matter.  Their complaint is on Trump, my First Amendment rights.  No, we're not.  I'm allowed to do it as long as I'm in public, sir.  SB 411, read it.  I'm not planning nothing.  Do you have proof that I'm planning anything?  I'm just doing a story.  I'm doing a follow-up story on... It doesn't matter what it looks like.  Is that illegal?  Well, there's a lot of cops getting shot right now.  Why do you think?  I don't want to bypass this if you're planning on it.  No, I'm not.  Why do you think?  I'm doing a follow-up story on a Facebook.  You're getting shot.  That's why.  I'm doing a follow-up story from Facebook about the corruption.  That's why I want to talk to you.  I don't want to talk to you.  Look at how you're getting.  You said you don't like cops, right?  Did I say that?  Yes, you did.  I said I'm afraid of cops when they approach me like that.  Okay, you're afraid of cops.  When you approach me like that, yeah.  Yeah, I'm keeping you guys accountable.  Is that a problem with that?  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  I don't know what you're talking about.  You need help.  You look like you need help because you're getting worked up for nothing.  Because of me.  You guys?  What about all the corruption on my channel?  What about all the corruption on my channel?  I don't know.  I don't know what you got going on.  I don't know what your deal is, pal.  Please stop.  Nope.  For the safety of our people.  Nope.  There's more people who are going to do it.  Why do you think you guys are getting shot?  Is it because of me?  It's like this.  It's your attitude right now.  I'm not going to stop recording. ",
