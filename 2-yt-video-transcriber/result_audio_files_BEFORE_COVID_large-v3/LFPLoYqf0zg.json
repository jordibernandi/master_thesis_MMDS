            "text": "What's up, guys?  What y'all got up, man?  What's happening with y'all?  Y'all hop on in the room with a player.  What's up, man?  What's up with y'all?  I'm out here in the streets.  What's up?  I'm out here in Hollywood.  I'm just waiting on them to finish my wings.  One of my favorite wing spots I go to out here.  Hollywood.  What's up, H-Town?  Checking in.  Yeah, one of my little favorite spots that I go to while I'm out here.  What's these little Uber bikes, man?  These little Uber scooters.  I'm on one of these little Uber scooters.  Holy shit.  Okay, I heard some beeping.  Let me get off that shit.  go to Popeye's.  Actually, Popeye's is right down there on Cahuenga.  I ain't going to Popeye's.  Y'all go check out the video I did about all y'all buck dancing, standing in line at Popeye's for hours.  If you stood in line at Popeye's for hours, just go ahead and when you get that biscuit, put that shit in a plastic bag and save it and eat off of it for a year, you fucking coon.  Niggas standing in line for some goddamn chicken sandwiches.  Y'all niggas ought to be ashamed of yourselves.  You understand me?  What's up, OG?  What's up, man?  Y'all ought to be ashamed.  What's going on, man?  We out here.  I hope y'all got your HC5 DVD.  I hope you got your HC5 DVD, ladies and gentlemen, at hiddencolorsfilm.com.  HiddenColorsFilm.com Did y'all catch that shit that French Montana said at the VMAs?  French was on the VMAs and he got an award.  And that nigga said some real bonehead shit.  At the VMAs.  French got up there and they told him to say that, by the way.  Let's be very clear.  He was instructed to say that shit.  Talking about, yeah... This country was made by immigrants.  Immigrants made this country.  That's the same shit they got that Camilla chick to do a couple of years ago.  They had her do the same exact thing.  They get them to deliberately say that.  Remember, man, like I said on my last broadcast, man, you got folks out here operating as tethers.  The white supremacists are using them as tethers against us.  They're doing little slick disrespectful shit like that for the sole purpose of being disrespectful.  I'm making sure my ride is cool.  Okay, there's a crazy motherfucker walking down the street.  But yeah, that thing that French pulled... And he said something very interesting also.  He's like, yeah, a lot of these people nominated are immigrants.  I told y'all that.  Most of the people on the charge, man, they're immigrants.  You see a lot of that in Hollywood.  That's the pipe.  That's the pipe.  That's the pipe.  That ain't nothing but the pipe.  That's the opioids.  But I told y'all, man, there's a concentrated effort orchestrated by the white supremacists and their Negro minions to tether us, to be our tethers so that they can replace us to wipe us out.  You dig?  All of this stuff is further reason why black people, foundational black Americans, we gotta be on top of our game.  We cannot let the white supremacists and their negro minions try to push us out of our lineage.  You dig?  Because that's what they're trying to do.  Yeah.  So, you know, this election cycle, this is very important.  This election cycle is the most important election cycle, really, in this country, as far as I'm concerned.  You know, we gotta really stay on top of our game.  We gotta stay the course.  They're coming at us hard.  Remember, immigration policies, all of these other issues where you have the white supremacists within the LBGT community, the anti-black racists within the immigration movement, That's an anti-Black movement, straight up.  We have to look at it as a hostile movement.  Don't let these boule Negroes run around here telling us how immigration is some kind of plus for us.  They cannot show or prove or give one example how immigration is a plus for Foundation of Black Americans.  They can't give one example how that shit is a plus.  I can give you several on how it is a negative.  It is a negative, it is a negative.  That's a nail in the coffin for Foundation of Black Americans.  I'm not at Popeyes, no.  I'm not at Popeyes.  I'm at my other wing spot.  But you know what, I'm gonna shoot a movie.  I'm gonna shoot another movie.  Before I do Bug Break, and there's this movie I've been, it's a crime drama that I've been talking about for the last couple of years that I wanna shoot.  The script is already ready.  I'm going to shoot that.  I'm going to shoot that.  I think it'll take like a month to shoot it because it's a real quick movie to shoot because it's supposed to be done in real time.  So what I'm going to do, we're going to start auditioning actors.  If you're in L.A.  and if you can act.  Y'all holla at me, man.  You got to be young.  This is for like, you got to look like your late teens, early 20s for the main characters.  We're going to have, the movie has a whole bunch of different peripheral characters who come in.  They have one or two lines.  So we, you know, we can get a lot of folks for that.  Yeah, but yeah, we're going to do that movie hopefully in the next couple of months.  We'll get everything organized, get all that together.  I know I'm always up hella late.  I'm always doing shit.  So where are my actors if you're in Hollywood?  Where are y'all at?  Where are my actors if you're out here in Hollywood?  If you're out here in  L.A.,  you can act.  You holler at me.  Let's make it happen.  Do you want to be an extra?  We can make that happen.  might be able to give you a speaking role.  Buck your eyes a little bit.  Let's play a coon.  Let's play a bedwet.  Let's play a mammy or something.  Well, yo, I talked about the whole chicken sandwich thing.  Go to my YouTube channel at Tariq Radio and I talk about that.  Go to my YouTube channel, Tariq Radio, and I talk about that.  I'm not going to tell you all the name of the movie yet.  Everybody's riding these little scooter things, man.  I wonder how much they cost.  Can you sing in the movie?  I don't think there are any singing parts in the movie.  I don't think there are no singing parts in the movie.  So you gotta ask me, can you be an actor?  Well, nigga, you ain't gonna come on set and have a fucking stroke, are you?  The insurance, we don't have insurance like that.  Yeah, if you got asthma now, because I don't want niggas to come on the set, then your breathing starts getting fucked up.  Then you try to sue me.  I'm in Hollywood, man.  I'm just waiting on, I ordered some food.  I'm just waiting on my food.  Yeah.  What's up, Darius?  You a filmmaker?  People are heavy on these little scooters, man.  I used to hang out here, man, when I was a kid.  I used to run these streets so heavy as a kid, as a matter of fact.  When I was homeless, right on this street right here, I used to be homeless and a motherfucker.  All right, here on Hollywood Boulevard.  Let me tell y'all something.  The library is right over here.  That's the library right there.  That library right there, guys.  I used to sleep in that library right there.  When I was homeless, there was a studio.  Let me break some shit down.  Over there is Hollywood and Vine.  That's Hollywood and Vine.  There was a studio.  My man Doug would have a studio.  We would be over there making our little beats.  And that's in the daytime, at night.  I mean, we were in the daytime rather.  I would make the beats at night.  But in the daytime, I would just kind of sleep over here at the library on Ivar.  I would sleep in the library on Ivar.  I was sleeping, I would kind of wash up in the restroom there.  And I would scrounge up 99 cents, go right down the block, down there on Coanga.  At the time, Popeyes had three wings and a biscuit for 99 cents.  So every day, I would scrounge up 99 cents and get me three wings and a biscuit.  Then... And right across the street was Death Row.  Death Row was over in the solar building right across there.  So I would see those dudes all the time.  So yeah.  So I was out here heavy, starving and struggling.  When I was a youth.  And now I got the number one fucking documentary in the world.  You feel that?  I got the number one documentary film in the world.  come a long way.  That's why I like to come out here sometimes.  That's why it's probably on a subconscious level why I like to come out.  Well, I like these wings.  This place has good wings.  But every blue moon, I like to come out here and just, you know, feel the energy to remember, you know, and see a lot of the cats and, you know, and see up and coming folks just kind of be reminded, man, shit, shit is real out here.  And unfortunately, there's a lot of black people who are homeless out here now, which is very unfortunate.  And I would like to help do something about that, especially downtown L.A You know, that's something that I don't like to see.  You know, that's something that I don't like to see.  I would like to kind of help do something about that.  So I'm trying to put my thinking cap on to see what I can do to fix that or help with that or assist with that.  Let me see what's up with my wings.  What's your name again, bro?  My name's Rick.  Rick, my man Rick.  Like I said, I met you in Cleveland with Dave for Better and all that.  Good looking, girl.

No.  Well, I got to get that Sprite.  All right.  No doubt.  No doubt.  No doubt.  Yeah, definitely got to do an oligography.  You want ice?  Yes, please.  What's funny, out here in  L.A.,  a lot of places aren't giving people straws.  They're not giving straws.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Be good, man.  All right.
