We actually shut down a couple of mines in 2019, unfortunately, just because they were so small.  It didn't make a lot of sense for us to remain active at those operations with the focus that we're currently having at the larger mines.  We'll be producing about 24 million ounces of silver equivalent next year.  About 60% of that is silver and the rest is gold.  So all the base metal mines which we had in production over the last few years are now in the process of being wound down. ",

We've been in this constant silver production decline now for four or five years, which is pretty shocking for the industry.  And it's not really showing up in the price to really any great degree.  You're right, silver has gone up over the last 12 months, which is nice to see.  For us, that's about an extra... $100 million in revenue at our size, so it's been a big impact for us, but still not at the price I think it should be trading at.  We're trading currently silver to gold at about 85 to 1, and we're mining only 8 to 1.  So the ratio's got to collapse, in my view, which puts triple-digit silver in play.  I know it sounds ridiculous when you're at $18 silver, but I think that's where silver prices should be. ",

A lot of the bullion dealers I talk with, Rick Rules mentioned in his physical trust that you also have people buying on a one-to-one ratio or a five-to-one ratio, which I would think for all the folks who are wondering when that ratio is going to converge, that is a real factor that could drive us there.

And leaving copper, gold made a lot of sense to me.  But once I discovered silver, the supply-demand fundamentals were just so astounding.  And this is a long time ago.  This is 18 years ago.  And today, now we've got new technologies.  Forget about computers and cell phones and all the electronics that we need as a human race, but we've got now solar panels, electric cars, electric airplanes now, and all kinds of things are happening with the energy grid around the planet that all is going to be consuming a ton of silver, and it's really not showing up in price.

            "text": "Yeah, I adopted this view back in 2012 when the metal prices really started to take a dip, and I started getting concerned because I realized then that this was the end of the cycle, and these cycles, when they end like that, you never know when they're going to turn around.  And we weren't particularly a high-cost producer, but when silver's at $40 or $50 and your costs are $20 an ounce, you're making a lot of money and you don't really care.  But all of a sudden silver's 20 bucks an ounce and you start losing money, which a lot of the miners did, including First Majestic.  I'm glad I made that decision early because we hit the ground hard with a team I put together.  you know, specialize in technology.  And I told them to just turn over every rock possible to try to find a dollar to save.  And we spent now over six years developing technology, some in-house and some, of course, off the shelf.  But our recovery is back in 2014, which is in our presentation.  People should go to our website and have a look at this for themselves.  But we had a 65% global recovery in all mines.  Which 65%, in the silver sector, it's not great, but it's kind of an acceptable number.  So we had over 30% of the metal going into waste.  back in those days.  Today, with the adoption of technology, where we just actually in Q3, which was our last public numbers that came out, we hit 88% recovery.  So that, and for every 1% at our size is an extra 150,000 ounces of free silver, basically, that drops to the bottom line. ",

I did come from the, you know, the finance side of the industry.  So, you know, I tend to look at, you know, decisions a little bit differently.  Technology, I think, is a great way for miners to really improve what they're doing.  And I think the mining sector as a whole needs to really start adopting technologies for a variety of different reasons.  Environmental footprint, just safety reasons, CSR reasons, and just to be smarter.  And also, at the same time, to reduce costs and increase profitability.  We're one of the leaders in doing that, and we're with some very good companies that are also leaders out there, but we differentiate ourselves by adopting technology.  We'll continually do that.  I think it's a real driver to our future.  But anyways, so contact me.  I've got a Twitter account, just Keith underscore Neumeier.  Feel free to see me on Twitter.
