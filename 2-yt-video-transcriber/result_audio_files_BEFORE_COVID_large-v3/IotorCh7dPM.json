Remarkably, the person, the political figure who is making the most sense on this subject, who has thought about it most deeply, is a Democrat who is running for president.  He's Andrew Yang.  He's an entrepreneur.  And as we said, he's a Democratic presidential candidate.  He says that artificial intelligence and expanded automation could potentially cause violence in this country and that we need to do something about it right now.  Andrew Yang joins us tonight.  Thanks very much for coming on.  And I meant that with sincerity.  I haven't heard anybody in our political conversation describe the threat as clearly and compellingly as you have.  Why should we be worried about automation? ",

Now, what happened to the manufacturing workers is now going to happen to the truck drivers, retail workers, call centers, fast food workers, and on and on through the economy as we evolve and technology marginalizes the labor of more and more Americans.

Artificial intelligence is real.  Self-driving cars and trucks are being tested on the highways right now.  And we need to evolve.  We need to actually start pushing the way we think of economic progress to include how our families are doing, how our children are doing, and things that would actually matter to the American people, because GDP is going to lead us off a cliff.  You know, robot trucks, great for GDP, terrible for many, many American communities.  So, we need to get with the program and figure out how to actually make this economy work for people. ",

As we're sitting here together, the labor force participation rate in the United States is 63.2 percent, the same level as Ecuador and Costa Rica.  And if anyone thinks that's where America ought to be, I mean, that number is even going to be further challenged when all this technology comes online.  So, we have to make America embrace this challenge of the 21st century and then try and address it together as a people. ",
