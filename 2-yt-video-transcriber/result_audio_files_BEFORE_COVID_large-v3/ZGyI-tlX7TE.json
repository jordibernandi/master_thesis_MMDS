I'm out with Joe Orga and we're doing a First Amendment audit at the town of Cumberland.  in Cumberland, Rhode Island.  We're at the City Hall and we're going to see if they respect our First Amendment right to film in public.  Let's take a look.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  Please do.  There you go.  Come smile, guys.  How are you ladies doing today?  Doing great?  We're just working on a story.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's a good story.  It's a good story.  It's how you make it.  It's not like a wanted story.  No, no, no.  I hope not.  No, no, no.  Do you need help with anything now?  No, we're good.  Thank you so much.  They were very nice.  What are you looking for?  Hello, how are you?  Is this a publicly accessible area?  What are you looking for?  Just the answer to that.  Yes, it is.  All right, cool.  We're just taking pictures.  What services do you provide here?  This is the legal department.  Legal department.  Okay, cool.  Is that open to the public in there?  Nope.  It's not?  Hi.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  What are you guys doing?  Well, what does it look like?  I really don't want to be on camera, though.  You'll be all right.  I'm going to try to clean up.  So I talked to them.  Yeah, we're, uh... Excuse me.  Excuse me.  You're not supposed to be in here.  Really?  Well, you're not supposed to just come in here and start taking pictures.  Oh, really?  Since when?  Is this a public space?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay, bye.  Well, why are you guys taking pictures, though?  Do you guys work for the public?  Yes, we do.  Okay, so you work for us.  We don't work for you.  I don't work for the public.  Well, you're in public.  You're in public.  Yeah, but what's the reason you guys are taking pictures, though?  We don't answer questions.  You're supposed to ask permission first.  We don't have to say anything.  You're not just talking about taking pictures.  All right, let me take you right back to high school.  Do you remember the First Amendment?  Okay, let's not talk to him, Miguel.  Let's have some respect, please.  Okay, mind your business, okay?  Excuse me, he's trying to tell us to stop recording, so you have respect.  Yeah, that's very disrespectful.  I'm not being disrespectful.  I mean, you have to give us an explanation.  Why are you doing that?  We don't have to do anything.  This is America.  Last time we checked.  We don't owe anybody no explanations as long as we're not breaking the law.  We're not breaking any laws.  Get away from me.  I want you to get a good picture.  You need to get away from me.  You're getting in my personal space, sir.  How big is your space?  Within my reach.  Within your reach?  Okay, how's this?  That's better.  That's what I wanted, a smile.  That's what I wanted.  How are we doing?  Good.  You weren't doing bad, but... We have business.  We're taking video.  We're not taking video on this bill without my permission.  Who are you?  I'm the public works director.  So you work for the public.  You don't tell us what to do.  You work for us.  Are you kidding?  No, that's actually the truth.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Maybe you want to call the cops and ask them?  Oh, it's very possible.  Because this is a publicly accessible area?  Yes, it is, but not to videotape and go around.  I don't know the nature of your business.  Since when?  You don't need to know anything, sir.  Oh, really?  I'm getting educated now.  You are.  Okay, thank you.  We don't owe any explanations to anybody.  Everybody downstairs was extremely nice.  This is the mean people area?  It is what it is.  It is what it is, right?  Discrimination is illegal.  There's a lot of things that are illegal.  Except videotaping.  In public.  Not illegal.  And that's called a comeback.  I actually support your right to do that, sir.  Yeah, we encourage you to do that, sir.  It's for your own safety.  Everybody's safety.  Everybody's on camera.  Do you have cameras in here?  No, not here.  Do you see any signs?  This is a public place.  They just asked me to get naked.  Excuse me?  I wouldn't make anything up.  Nobody would ever ask you that.  At least not from us.  I have the right to ask that too, but I don't want it.  Thank you, sir.  That was a funny one.  I didn't want to embarrass myself.  Come on, man.  You don't want to get naked here.  You can't do that.  Now that you can't do in public.  And we're not here to film you, sir.  So you're all right.  If I don't want my picture taken by you, what do I do about that?  You have to take it, my friend.  You work for the public.  And we're not doing anything illegal, so take it easy.  That's a good idea.  If you want to have privacy, you've got to create privacy.  But if you're in public space, you don't have any assumption of privacy.  There's no expectation of privacy in public, sir.  And this guy... It's gonna look like a fool.  I don't mean no disrespect, but you guys are the ones telling us what to do.  But you work for the public.  Yes, it does.  Yes, it does.  And discrimination is illegal.  I got to put that center on too.  Yeah.  Will this any changes?  Which is free to roll, because this is one of those.  Yeah, I was sitting right here.  I was sitting right here.  And I wanted his public comment.  And then the deputy, whatever you want to call him, put his hands up.  And what did he say?  Sit down.  Hello.  Hi, this is Sarah calling from the mayor's office.  How are you?  So we have gotten a couple complaints here from some people that work at Town Hall.  There are some folks that are here recording people.  Yeah, yeah.  This isn't public access.  It is.  You can't touch me.  You don't have a right to touch me.  Well, you don't have a right to be here.  It's public.  No, it's not public.  This is the mayor's office.  This is the mayor's office.  This is not a public office.  This is not a public office unless you're invited in.  This is not publicly accessible.  You know what?  I don't feel comfortable.  I feel threatened by you.  Well, get away from me then because I'm not the one.  I've never threatened you.  I feel threatened by you.  You're very close to me.  You don't talk to us.  Everybody here is afraid of cameras.  We're just working on a story and they're making a fool out of themselves.  Some people here are feeling pretty threatened, threatened, threatened, and we would like someone if they could come down here.  We've never threatened anybody.  Threatened.  Come on.  It's all on video.  Yeah, no, I know.  I'm just... This is the mayor's office.  Isn't this a public accessible area?  It is.  I'm the mayor.  You're the mayor?  Mayor.  Nice to meet you.  Yeah, I think it's just about a personal space thing at this point.  We're calling the police on us.  They're also right in front of us.  All right.  I think that you're perfectly permissible to be in a public building with people conducting people's business.  I don't have any... I don't have any personal problem with you.  But this is a publicly accessible area, right?  Absolutely.  Thank you.  The whole building.  The whole building?  The whole building, yes.  Not my building.  People's building.  Thank you, Mayor.  Thank you so much.  Have a good day.  How's it going?  I'm all right.  What's your name?  I'd rather not say.  Hey guys, just so you know.  Thank you, appreciate that.  You like that?  It's not bad, right?  There you go.  Thank you guys.  Hey, just so you know, they would just respect if you guys just, this is a public area.  Maybe just wander in the hallway.  Just don't go in anyone's rooms for me, alright?  I tell you what, we are totally within our rights.  We're not intruding.  We're not getting in the way of their business.  And the mayor is going to give us approval.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, we never threaten anyone.  Cool.  Let me just say something.  So if the doors are closed, just don't open them for me.  I don't know.  I just got here, right?  You can walk around and look at all the artwork.  I mean, you got cool stuff.  I think the kids are on the area doing this.  So if you guys want to do that, look at that.  Cool.  Just don't knock on people's windows, get in their faces for me.  Is that cool?  Never done any of that.  All right.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Well, besides that I'm sad that they're wasting resources and they don't know their jobs.  That's it.  Okay, so that's fine.  That's your opinion, right?  That's cool.  I can pass it, though.  This is sick.  Okay.  They're rec specs.  What do they do?  They're like the sports.  Are they prescribed or no?  Yeah.  They're the sports version.  So they don't fall off my head just in case I get sacked by some thugs or something.  Bike riding and stuff.  You're all set?  We're all good.  All right.  Hey, so like I said, just don't.  Be like, in their face and stuff.  If they, you know what I mean?  No.  Actually, I'll tell you what.  One person that did get in my face, he's actually good now.  He's respectful.  Who is he?  Michael Thompson?  No, no, no.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm just letting you know that that's what happened.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But we haven't been disrespectful.  We haven't been yelling or anything.  Not invading his privacy, nothing?  Nope.  We have been going, every area that we've gone to is publicly accessible.  Cool.  Yeah, so long as you're not breaking the doors and stuff.  We're cool, right?  All right.  Do you guys like it so far?  Do you know when it was built, this town hall?  When was it?  I don't know.  I don't want to ask you guys.  I don't know.  19th?  No, older than that.  Oh, 1747, is that it?  Well, that's around the town's establishment, so.  Yeah, that's when it was incorporated.  Yeah, so have you guys gone, like, Do you go upstairs and just downstairs right now?  Is that?  Yeah.  Cool.  You just, like, then you go, like, in the offices, though, because obviously it's private.  Well, that door is publicly accessible.  Yeah.  If it's open, yeah, sure.  But if it's closed, just respect that.  No, no, no.  If doors are closed, I still have the right to go into them, unless it's clearly marked, like, no admittance.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm saying if they're locked, if they're in a meeting, stuff, respect that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  I'm not going to try to force them.  So are you guys on the way out soon, or what are we doing?  We'll stay here a little longer, and then we'll leave.  Handshakes?  Sure.  Thank you, guys.  Appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you.  And it was, what's Jay say for you?  Joseph.  All right.  I'm Joe.  Joe?  Yeah.  Nice.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care.  Thank you.  Bye.  What'd you call the police?  I just did what I was told.  Yeah, this is a public place.  I'm sure the mayor gets a lot of people doing stories on him.  It would be nice if you guys don't call the cops on me and try to get me inside a cage.  That would be nice.  You don't have to consult anything with me.  You're looking like a fool for calling the cops on me.  We don't have to ask or tell anybody.  we have rent.  I mean, I'm in town, so suppose I don't want you to film me.  I mean, that's my question.  Well, you have to go home.  I can't go inside your house.  I could be in public.  I also feel like they're just not doing their job now.  No, they want us in a cage.  They want us taken by the police.  I think these are all public records as well.  Hey, you see what this is?  This is the new police station.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's a conference room.  Communication center.  Jeez, this thing is elaborate.  Detectives.  Doesn't it suck when things don't go your way?  Look, man, we don't come here to start trouble.  You guys started.  I didn't start anything.  The major's like, oh, no, guys, come here.  Record, record.  But you guys say, oh, but you're all right.  That's because we got to take it every day.  You get what?  We got to take stuff every day.  This is the worst office in the place.  We didn't even talk to you.  You guys are really busy, I've got to tell you.  No, but it's just, it's always like, I mean, this is where the shit comes.  Oh, yeah.  What's this office?  Why do you guys... Building.  Oh, okay.  Building and Department of Public Works.  This is like the most regulations right here.  All the problems right here.  All the problems right here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And usually we have people coming in and, you know, they talk down to the women, you know, it's just... Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's... No, we don't do that.  That's when you guys should start recording because you guys have the capacity to do that too.  And then make those people, when they do that.  I asked, my next thing is I'm asking for cameras to be put here.  That's a great idea.  Just for when the women, you know, when the guys come in because, I mean, really, I mean, some of them are pretty bad.  Mm-hmm.  But.  Yeah, I was, I know they have cameras downstairs, right?  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm thinking we're going to get some up here just so like when we have situations or if we have.  Make sure there's audio on that too because like that's how you hold them down.  All the audio too?  Keep the audio with it, yeah.  If you think it's necessary for this kind of thing, like a hallway would be like you wouldn't need audio.  Right, but in here.  Yeah.  Yeah, because this is where, like I said, I worry about it more than anything.  Also like if people make claims like about properties and stuff and then you find it to be false, you have audio of it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, that's true too.  All kinds of things.  Well, I really appreciate you guys doing the clarification.  You guys are doing great.  Okay.  Keep up the good work.  How are you?  Just going to record her real quick.  Yeah, probably maybe when you get back, because we're almost done now.  Yeah, exactly.  You have to go to the Wi-Fi.  Great.  Thanks.  Thanks. ",
