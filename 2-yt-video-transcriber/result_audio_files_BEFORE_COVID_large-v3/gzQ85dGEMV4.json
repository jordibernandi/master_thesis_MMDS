I'm going to try not to be partisan about this, and I'm going to try to keep my cool, because right now I'm pretty upset.  Walking into the chamber today, and I realize that it's West Virginia Republican Party Day and that's party day today, and that's great.  Okay, I'm also the member of a political party, and that's wonderful too.  And I'm going to try not to make this partisan, but as part of the display out there, there's a poster with a picture of the planes flying into the Twin Towers in New York on 9-11.  And underneath, there's a picture of a sitting member of Congress, Representative Omar, I believe from Minnesota.  I find it distasteful.  I said so.  I went over and spoke with the people at that booth that I believe is sanctioned by a political party.  They're out there with them.  And I expressed my disgust about something like that.  that really, I believe, points out a hatred and a mistrust of somebody because of their religious background, because of their religion.  Because that congresswoman isn't from, she's not from Saudi Arabia, she's from Somalia.  She entered this country through a refugee program.  And I can tell you that personally, I'm proud to live in a country where somebody can come into this country with absolutely nothing and wind up in the halls of Congress representing the state of Minnesota.  That makes me proud to be an American.  But I'm disgusted by what I see out there.  And maybe it's a little bit personal for me because I'm also a member of a religious minority who in the early 30s in Germany might see a similar poster about a different religion.  And that's one of the many reasons why that bothers me.  All I can say is if it was a Democratic Party day-to-day and there was somebody promoting hate speech with a poster that denigrated a member of a religious minority in the people's capital, outside of the people's house, if she was on the other foot, I would condemn that.  And I would disassociate myself from that because it's ugly.  It's hateful and there's absolutely no place for it in American politics.  That's not in the country that I love.  Not in the state that I love.  We all give up our time during this time of year to come up here and serve our constituents because we love this state.  Well, I love everybody in the state, no matter what they look like, who they pray to, who they love.  I'm tired of it.  It disgusts me.  And I personally wanted to stand up publicly and condemn that poster out there.  I'm ashamed of it. ",

So I applaud the gentleman for his passion and for the intent of his words.  My issue with what I saw outside has to do with another truly American foundational issue, and that's freedom of speech.  So while I may not agree with everything that is out there, I do agree that freedom of speech is something that we have to protect.  Even if we don't agree with it, maybe especially when we don't agree with it.  There are times when people in this chamber, my dear friends, my colleagues, will get up and say something that I fundamentally, completely disagree with.  But if you ask me, well, will I fight to make sure that they have the right to stand up and do that?  Oh yes, with every breath in my body, absolutely I will.  And I'll do it just as hard for something I don't agree with as I will for something that I happen to personally share that belief.  So I'd like to ask the members of the body, when you see something that you disagree with, please don't respond in the way that I unfortunately saw with my own eyes, where you call the people names that I'm not going to repeat in here.  where you barge through the door and hit the doorkeeper, which I also saw with my own eyes while the pledge is going on, because you're understandably upset.  Now, the person who did this is actually a really good person.  And while these motivations that make us behave this way are good motivations, we care.  We want to do something.  We have to remember... We have to remember that our actions are supposed to be representing our districts back home and that's not how our people want us to act.  If we get righteously angry, that's okay.  This is the place, right?  This is the place where we get to stand up and speak for what we believe in and we have to make sure that those words and actions while we're in this house are appropriate.  So I'm gonna ask my dear friends and colleagues to please remember, please remember that. ",

And I told him as a freshman delegate coming in, I respected him as my speaker.  I walk out of the chambers and I see a discussion going on with Delegate Pushkin and a lady with a display, which was reprehensible.  But like the gentlelady said, she has her freedom of speech and I respect that.  And while I was talking with Delegate Pushkin and I said, you're not going to change her views, come on, let's get back inside.  The sergeant of arms of this body had enough nerve to say to us, all Muslims are terrorists.  The sergeant of arms of this body that represents the people of the state of West Virginia said all Muslims are terrorists.  That's beyond shameful.  And that's not freedom of speech. ",
