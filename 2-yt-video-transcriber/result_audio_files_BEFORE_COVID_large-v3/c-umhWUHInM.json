            "text": "I believe that God put us on earth for a reason.  God put me on earth for a reason.  And it's exciting.  It's exciting to serve Him.  And I said last year, or I should say the Holy Spirit said while we were praying in power prayer, this is where a lot of the action happens is in prayer.  I said, we are going to America next year.  And sure enough, just we had all these open doors, TV, radio, new churches.  we didn't know.  All these things opened up this year.  But we prayed it out last year.  And anyone who was at Power Prayer knew we first speak it.  Before anything becomes reality, you first pray it out or speak it out.  and sure enough so we had our first ever historic partners meeting in austin texas and we had great you know.  we showed you some photos and all that but it was great.  a good crowd good people came and one of the things that happened on this trip was that I met, and I said, and I keep saying, I said, one day, one day, I'm going to be in the White House.  One day, I'm going to meet Trump in the White House.  So, I keep saying this, and there's really no reason.  I'm here in Melbourne.  I'm not, you know, I'm not political.  I'm not known in politics.  But on this trip, we met one of the 12 presidential advisors.  He's over campaign 2020.  His name is Stephen Rogers, and he's over Homeland Security.  So I check.  I said, you mean you get the briefing on Iran?  He says, yes, I do.  And he looks the part, doesn't he?  I mean, this guy looks like a presidential advisor.  So we sat down, had lunch together in a golf club, and he starts quoting the Bible.  I mean, he can quote scripture after scripture, and I'm like, praise God.  This is what we prayed out.  We were so tired of Obama and all of his compromises and his deceptions, and we wanted... Godly people.  Godly people.  Over our government and also in America.  Because America affects everybody.  And we are meeting them.  And they are good people.  And they really know.  In fact, he was saying, he says, we Christians have an advantage because God told us some of the things that are going to happen in Iran and all that.  So he... He had an imperfect understanding of the Ezekiel War and he asked me about it.  He says, well, what do you think is going to happen?  And what is the time frame?  And so I told one of the presidential advisors over homeland security what I believe is going to happen in the Middle East according to the Bible.  How cool is that?  And the Bible says that a man's gift will bring him before great men.  You will not be with mean men.  That's what the Bible says.  So what do you do?  You say, oh, well, nice for you, but not for me.  Then it doesn't happen.  You say, why does it happen for everybody else?  I don't ever get a lucky break.  Well, then it's not going to happen.  It's all based on your own negativity.  And your negative thinking then becomes negative speaking.  So you've got to stop that.  Now, if you're not a Christian, you can't stop it.  Let me tell you that right now.  If you're not a born-again Christian, you cannot stop it because it is your nature.  You need to surrender to Jesus, become a born-again Christian, and then your nature is changed.  So the difference is, you know what's right mentally.  Everybody in the world knows what's right, but in your nature, you understand?  Your nature is what you're inclined to do.  It's almost instinctive.  you're going to have a propensity to do things according to your nature.  If your nature is away from God, far from God, you're going to do things that are anti what God says.  But if you surrender to God and you say, I give my life to Jesus, I really want Jesus to save me, then His nature comes into you.  Then when you think wrong or speak wrong, somehow it, I say it scratches your spirit.  You know, it's almost like putting nails on a chalkboard, going like that.  It's like, oh, something's not right.  I feel it's not right.  Even though your mind still can have the pollution of the world, your words can still have the bad habits of the past, your nature has changed.  And so your mouth and your mind can catch up to your nature.  It will change.  I always said it's going to, so you're going to see one day Donald Trump's going to call me or maybe Mike Pence and say, I request your presence at somewhere.  Now this was a very good thing to have this meeting because I am working on a book that's called 10 ways to save America.  I'll do one for Australia as well, but let's get America first.  Okay.  10 ways to save America.  And it's up to him and up to God, whether he's going to be in that, in that hall of fame.  If he continues to keep pushing for pro-Christian, pro-life, pro-baby, pro-church, you know, legislations and orders, then his place is secure in history and in eternity.  But there's a lot of challenges.  There are a lot of problems in America and here.  And so I have some things to tell the president and tell the world.  What does the Bible say about good government?  What does the Bible say about building a good society?  We've had enough of the left-wing, secular, atheist nonsense.  It doesn't work.  We want to go back to the Bible and see how does God build society?  How does God do it?  And we don't hear it preached, so how would anybody do it?  How would our politicians do it?  So get this.  I'm sitting next to Steve Rogers, having lunch, and he says, what can I do for you?  I said, That's the question I was going to ask you.  I said, I'm not wanting anything from you.  I would like to know, what can I do for you?  What can we do for you so that the nation is godly again?  The slogan is, make America great again.  We want to make America godly again.  And then we want to make Australia godly again.  What can we do for you?  And you know his answer?  One of the top presidential advisors has the ear of the president, gets called into the White House on a regular basis, appears on TV to speak on the president's behalf on a regular basis.  He said, Pastor Steve, you know what you can do?  He said, preach sin.  He said, the ministers don't preach sin anymore.  How would the politicians know what sin is when the church no longer preaches sin?  Imagine saying that in Australia.  You'll clear out half the church.  That will be a very unpopular church in Australia.  Because, mate, don't condemn me, mate.  God and me, we're friends.  We're best buddies.  Go to church or not, we're best buddies.  I am a friend of God.  I don't pay my tithe, but I'm a friend of God.  I don't go to church.  I am a friend of God.  He calls me disobedient.  Can't sing that, right, in Australia?  Can't.  So offensive to our culture.  But this is the problem.  We have so neglected our own Bible, neglected our message, that we have no hope of our politicians acting morally.  So our own young people have no concept.  No concept.  And probably the majority of the church out there is just addicted to the internet and porn.  Hello.  Hello.  How are we going to be an example to anybody?  Preach sin.  Pastor Steve, please preach sin, he said.  Well, I'm doing it anyway.  I'm doing it anyway.  It's okay to be condemned a little bit.  Hopefully it saves your life.  You do something bad.  If you do drugs, you should feel condemned a little bit, shouldn't you?  Yeah?  You sin, you should feel a little bit of conviction because it's your hope.  It's sorrow that leads to repentance.  It could save your life.  It's a good thing.  So, very excited.  I think that God has put a stamp of approval on this because I'm living here in Melbourne.  I'm preaching here in Melbourne.  We have no connection.  And on one trip, without scheduling it, we are sitting with one of the presidential advisors and we're like writing down some of these, you know, hot tips and great quotes from him.  That means it's God, isn't it?  How did it happen?  Because I don't speak negative stuff.  I don't say, oh, well, we're over here in Melbourne and wish we had more money, wish we had a bigger facility, or wish more people support us.  It doesn't matter.  You and God is enough.  Just keep it up.  Don't ever give up.  Don't ever speak down about yourself.  Amen?  A few other good things are happening in our church.  We've got a new, a revamped Chicolanti.org blog.  I say that we have discovered church online and we facilitate discipleship in two ways.  You can get, I will disciple you by text, by content.  that is written, written content.  that's at Ciccolanti.org, or video and audio content, and that's at Patreon.  Ciccolanti.org got hacked, it got attacked, and this is what happens when people get to know your name, then you get bad people trying to hack you and pretend they're you, and so Ciccolanti.org was down for a long time, but it's back up and it's better than before.  It's clean, it looks great, and I'll be sharing more written content at Ciccolanti.org, so go and subscribe there.  And then if you want more videos and audios, this is mainly for our audience.  that's watching us because there's a lot of people who don't have a home church.  That's what Discover Church Online is about.  We're actually discipling people.  I'm interacting with people, so I can't respond to everybody on Facebook and YouTube, but I do respond to people on Patreon.  All right, we've got another great thing happening at Discover Church.  We were given, well, we're not given, we bought a property for far, far under market value.  And it's a corner.  We like corner properties.  You notice we're on a corner.  In the history of Discover Church, we are always on a corner.  So we haven't broken tradition yet.  We got another corner property.  And we're going to build a house there, Discover House.  This means an extension of the ministry.  It will be multi-purpose.  It will be for 24 hours prayer, Bible school, recording studio, all the things that we don't have here.  So there's no point moving here to there because... Well, what is the point?  What's the point of moving?  The point is to extend, expand, advance, do more stuff that we can't do before.  So that's what we're going to do.  So that's called Discover House.  And we've already talked to an architect who's done a lot of great work and talked to council, given us some concepts and preliminary drawings.  And it's looking really good.  I'm very happy with him.  But it's going to be a completely, really complete new building.  So we are projecting $1.5 million.  Now, since I've said that, we've had maybe a handful of people give us $10,000.  We literally had people just walk into the church one time, never came back, and said, I want to give $10,000.  And so we're very grateful because the... architectural bill with project management fee and all that was originally a hundred thousand dollars.  we've shaved it off and i think it's still coming over sixty thousand dollars.  but that's just the way it is.  that's just the way it is.  you you just have to pay it so we we can get going with the money that's come in but we don't have enough to bill.  So I'm going to build it anyway because I believe it's God's place.  And you can come along for the ride and have a part and enjoy because that's what family does and everybody will benefit and we'll be able to do more things there.  So I'm asking you to pray about what is your part in helping build Discover House.  And maybe some people watching us or listening to us have businesses like concreting or they sell gates.  And I know people have mentioned that and I can't keep up.  I'm sorry.  Then we need 1.5 million.  Amen?  Oh, very weak amen on Discover House.  Are you spectating or are you going to be a contributor?  A Christian should not be a spectator.  And this is a vision that I got when I went to America.  I realized one of the biggest ministries on TV and the Internet, it's called Prophecy Watchers.  And when I was interviewed by them, I was driven to their ministry center, and I just realized, it's just a house.  It's literally a house.  And God had been speaking to my heart about Discover House.  So I felt really good, like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, in my spirit, this is confirmation.  A real TV, big TV ministry, you're talking about $20 million building.  We're not even needing that.  We're really skimping.  We're going on a residential scale, doing something that is global scale.  So I'm quite happy with that vision, and And I think we can do it.  So with the support of people that are watching, now believe it or not, you think that's enough, right?  You think Discover Church in Melbourne is doing enough.  We got more.  We're developing also social media.  We're developing software that I think will be great for the entire body of Christ.  It's in the works, but everything is slow because we have so many things going on and things can proceed only as much as people support.  If that wasn't enough, I have a new project I want to add.  I have a new project I want to add.  There is a four-acre property that is going up for sale in Thailand.  I want us to buy it because it's super cheap.  and it will be great for the entire body of Christ.  It's owned by a church whose pastor was very prominent.  He would be the president of all the charismatic churches.  He's like the head of the AOG denomination in Thailand, and he passed away.  He invited me to speak in his church many times.  He had one of the biggest churches in Thailand.  He's passed away.  And what happens is when a very charismatic leader passes away, you've got all this property and projects, and they can't keep up.  They can't do it.  So they want to let go of four acres where they've already run through.  It's 200 kilometers outside of the city of Bangkok, but they've already paid to run electricity and water to the property.  So that's huge.  That's worth a lot of money.  Four acres.  You can have Bible school, nursing home, you know, training center.  You can do anything.  The sky's the limit.  And four acres in Thailand is only $500,000.  I know.  People are like, what?  Now, in America, maybe that seems like a lot.  But here in Australia, it's like, what?  Because you can't get anything for $500,000.  So, It makes no sense for me, while I'm waiting for 1.5 million for Australia, to be asking for $500,000 for Thailand, but I think God's big enough.  So if somebody wants to be a part of it, we can do it, but we got to move on this one.  We need to move on this, because if we don't snatch it up, you'll get some secular businessman, you'll get some Buddhist temple getting built, and I just, I so hate that.  opportunities come and then Christians just delay.  So some things are timed.  We need you to act now.  So whatever the project is, if you want social media to happen, then we need to pay the programmers.  If you want Discover House to be built, then we need to pay the architect and the builders.  If you want missions to be extended in Thailand, one of the least evangelized countries on earth.  I think Japan and Thailand are the least evangelized.  They're the two countries left on earth.  So this is a big deal, but man, what an awesome thing if you can own all that property for 500.  So I think we can.  I think we can, and I have faith.  So I'm just presenting all of that, and I pray that we'll hear from you so that we can get these things done very quickly in Jesus' name. ",
