            "text": "We're here in the city of Jerusalem talking about the names of God.  One of the most beautiful names is Adonai Yeraeh, which means the Lord will provide.  It actually comes from the root word ra'ah, which means God will see.  So as Abraham was coming up to Mount Moriah, which is right here behind me, and he says to Isaac, God will provide when Isaac says, Father, where is the sacrifice for the altar?  What Abraham was saying to his son is, God sees our need and God will provide.  In my own life as a worship leader, I have many times cried out to the Lord, God, I need to see your provision.  I thirst and hunger for you.  And I'm comforted that I can worship this God who always sees and who always provides for everything that we need.  So this week, as we worship and pray, we will say, Adonai Yera'eh. ",
