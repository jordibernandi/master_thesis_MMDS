            "text": "And I'm here to discuss the project that we are pressing forward on today.  Actually, well, at midnight tonight and on December 5th to actually stand up against the vaccines.  And we have actually gone through every single legal case, every failure or failed attempt to stop the mandated usage of vaccines.  And we have worked through all of the different angles, all of the constitutional rules, issues that are being violated and all the different ways to overcome this.  Now, that being said, we have identified exactly how to do it.  And it's going to take more than just being on the computer.  We're going to need people in real places sending out real certified letters to the post office.  We're going to need support.  Now, we, as a rule, never sell products.  We don't solicit donations and we don't advertise.  but in this one case because this issue is too important for us to be proud about that we do need donations.  we need people to participate and contribute in any way they can.  we are going to uh share a link on the lawfulamerica.com site where people can post any amounts of donation they'd like from a dollar to you know a million dollars.  it doesn't matter.  But at the end of the day, we realize if we're going to overcome these nearly impossible odds, we're going to need the money to do that.  Now, we fully expect our actual grant funding to clear.  And when that does, there'll never be an issue with money for us again.  And we've already been approved for that.  However, in the meantime, this issue is pressing on us right now.  We're watching what everyone's doing.  And what I know is what they're doing is they're not considering the whole issues.  We have.  It's not enough to be on the footsteps of the courthouse.  It's not enough to complain about it.  Real action has to be taken.  And it has to be taken by the people commanding back and bringing back constitutional law, which has always been the law of the land.  But we have silently consented.  And even that is unconstitutional.  So we need money to do this.  So I'm asking everybody who watches us, who sees us now in the future, any way you can contribute, we would greatly appreciate it.  We need it.  And it's for your benefit.  I guarantee if you just eliminate, you know, the one can of soda you buy a day for, you That would be a world of difference.  You could drop, you know, 15 bucks in there and that'll make a huge difference.  And if everybody did that and we start to share these videos and we start to volunteer and contribute, we can change what's happening in this country, you know, and go from awful to lawful, right?  So that's what we got.  And thank you so much for your support. ",
