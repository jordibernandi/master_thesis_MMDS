The US and dozens of other nations who have sided with opposition leader Juan Guaido are leading us to believe that.

So it's easy to paint a picture of Nicolas Maduro as this evil despot who's letting his people starve.  But on the flip side, we've got Nicolas Maduro saying, well, there isn't a crisis in Venezuela.  And he's called this whole thing a U.S.  orchestrated show. ",

            "text": "Now let's talk about the situation in Venezuela.  I think that most of you are not indifferent about what happens in that country.  It seems to us that Washington decided not to celebrate the fifth anniversary of coup d'etat in Ukraine, so they decided to organize a coup d'etat in a neighboring state, and they want to preserve a zone of their influence in the region.  Such action is fraught with a confrontation between proponents and adversaries of the legitimate authorities of Venezuela.  All this provocative action goes in line with the military science, and we have all the information about it.  And you can find the information that we are talking about on the social media and in the internet.  We see that American armed forces and their military equipment are deployed near the Venezuelan territory.  We received information that the United States and their allies in NATO are going to procure a large bulk of weapons and ammos.  and they will transfer them to opposition forces for Venezuela.  We are talking about samples and prototypes of heavy machine guns, underbarrel grenade launchers, grenade machine guns, mobile air defense systems, ammos for small arms and alternative weapons of various uses.  That's what we are talking about when Washington is organizing humanitarian convoy in the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Venezuela.  They are going to use neighboring countries and cargo planes of international freight forward company, but actually such a sad story has Ukrainian traces, particularly.  they're going to use state-owned company Antonov.  They pay also attention to propaganda.  They also have to file reports to U.S.  voters.  what's going on in Venezuela.  And the United States are taking major steps, particularly the U.S.  administration escalates the situation.  And still the idea to the world that there is a point of no return and Maduro should leave.  And Washington and their plans are going to implement them till the end.  And no one is confused by the fact that such scenario might have dire consequences.  Particularly, we paid attention to the statement made by the US President Trump in Miami, where he called them to ignore orders of their legitimate leader.  Just could you imagine the situation that the leader of another country would call the military not to not to implement the orders of their legitimate leader.  And these statements are recorded by all the experts, and we see this is a clear example of the intervention into domestic affairs of another country.  So, again, the president of another country makes a call to the military of another state, independent state, not to listen to the orders of their legitimate leader.  I think that the United States and politicians who favor and accept such actions have no right to talk about legitimate or illegitimate things in the world.  Also, some soldiers experienced blackmailing and threats that they might lose everything if they break the oath.  On the 18th of February, in our statement, we have provided our detailed response and reaction to such dangerous plans.  The reactions show that we were heard and many share our opinion.  Someone can say someone has forces and powers to agree with us, but some people remain silent and they have no opportunity to express their agreement with us.  We're talking about Venezuela, but not also about Venezuela.  We're not talking about different evaluations about the situation in Venezuela, but we are talking about assuming the responsibility for maintaining or violating the peace in the country.  And if their plans will be successful, it means that the aggressive foreign policy of the United States will reach a new level, and they will take new military, dangerous, reckless attempts.  they will escalate the situation and there will be a very dangerous peak of confrontation in the world.  So we see that they want to impose the idea of the dual power in Venezuela.  Now they supported another president who is actually not legitimate and by doing so they don't have any other opportunity for making any diplomatic action or maneuvers.  Our contacts say that such a response cannot be supported.  We believe that it's very important to respect the UN Charter and all the principles enshrined in it, which is the non-intervention into domestic affairs, the respect of sovereignty, the non-recourse to the use of force.  It's also very important to understand that such principles of the United Nations are very important and fundamental for the world.  And those who are worried about the humanitarian situation in Venezuela, we can only advise you to follow the example of the countries that cooperating, implementing humanitarian programs with UN bodies and the government of the country.  There is one example, the example of Russia.  Through the World Health Organization, we provided medicine and medical equipment to Caracas airport, and this is the contribution that Russia is making.  Going back to the 23rd of February, we believe into the force and wisdom of the Venezuelan people.  Whatever is the division in the society, there is only one country, and this is the position of our country.  Also, we have another thing to say about Venezuela.  On the 18th of February, the U.S.  President Donald Trump made a statement in Miami, and also the U.S.  President shared U.S.  foreign policy strategy in Latin America.  His statement was full of ideologically driven cliches.  He was talking about a twilight hour of socialism, and he was talking about political changes in Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and the creation of a uniform political landscape in Latin America.  When I'm talking about uniform political landscape and democracy, these are just things that are incompatible to each other.  It seemed to us that it was the president of the Western hemisphere, James Monroe, who was speaking at that time and not the president Trump.  And it seemed to us that it was.  1823 and not 2019, just one quote.  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it's the right of all nations to put their own interests first.  We do not seek to impose our way of life to anyone.  Do you know who said that?  You would be surprised, but this is President Trump who said that.  But he said that in the inaugural address.  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. ",

            "text": "We have reasonable question.  When he was talking what he was thinking and what are the current ideas in Washington, I wouldn't like comment the recent statement of Donald Trump where he neglects rights of other nations to determine their destiny without any intervention sanctions or pressure.  I will just paraphrase the quotation said by Benito Juarez.  Disrespect for the rights of others is not peace.  And we're not talking about the foreign political discourse of the U.S.  President Donald Trump.  His discourse was aimed mainly at U.S.  voters, at the domestic audience for Florida.  and nations, all the nationals that come from the countries to the south of Rio Grande, whose votes will be very important at the next elections.  We see their attempts to depreciate all the political achievements and accomplishments that Latin America and the Caribbean nations made in their attempts to shape a new style of interstate communications in the Western Hemisphere.  And this region, was the first region that become the first nuclear weapons free zone.  And this region was proclaimed the peace zone where all countries trying to coexist harmonically by respecting their social and political system.  The Latin America and the Caribbean basin formed a unique concept, unity in diversity.  It has nothing to do with the concept of political loyalty.  and political uniformity, which is mentioned by Washington and the United States.  Just think about it, unity and diversity, just two different things, absolutely different things.  I would like also to tell you that the offer to replace the unity was the well-forgotten things that remained in the past.  The offer to join the right flank, those who believe to be leaders of the region.  I would like to hope that today's politicians that will determine the destiny of the region will know that the pediment of the Colombian foreign ministry in Bogota bears the words of Simona Bolivar, each nation has right to choose a government on its own discretion and other nations should respect its choice.  it's so relevant today.
