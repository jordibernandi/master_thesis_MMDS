They hurt the men who want to stay home longer with their kids.  They hurt men in real physical ways because we do have a problem in this country where women are more likely to be the victims of violence at home.  Men are more likely to be the victims of violence in public.  But in both, the common factor is it's men committing the violence by and large, not exclusively.  but by and large.  And so these rigid kind of ideas of masculinity hurt everyone.  And so when we talk about feminism, when we talk about changing those structures, it's to create an equality for the benefit of everyone and to get rid of some of the things that hold everyone back.

I do stand by my original statement, though, that there's a brand of more radical feminism that insists that our culture is best characterized as an oppressive patriarchy.  And I think that, first of all, that that's an appalling sociological doctrine.  And I think it has very negative psychological effects.  And they won't be limited to men.
