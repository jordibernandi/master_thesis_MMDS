            "text": "Can you be a Christian and not be constantly asking questions?  I hope not.  You see, let me put this in a different context.  People often say to me, do you ever doubt?  I say all the time.  I've spent my whole life doing it.  The trouble with the word doubt is that the moment anybody uses it in a Christian context, they immediately think of a black hole of doubt that everything is collapsing and nothing is true and the blackness of darkness is about to... But that kind of psychosis.  It's rare, mercifully, and it does happen, and it happens to Christians, and often can be corrected by medicine because we go wrong in our psychological states.  But you see, what is doubt?  It's to be in two minds.  It's asking questions.  And I discovered very young, and then I practiced it in Cambridge, and I've been doing it ever since, which is why I'm sitting here.  And that is to develop my faith by constantly asking questions.  Have you ever read the Bible?  How many questions did Jesus ask?  And he taught his disciples by asking questions and letting them struggle with them.  That's how we learn in school, at least I hope it is.  And we need to constantly ask questions.  And it's exhilarating.  Let me give you a little tip out of my book, Have No Fear.  Because people often don't know how to engage with people outside their own circle.  And I say, well, when I meet new people, I try to practice.  I sometimes fail, of course.  But I try to practice a very simple thing.  I meet somebody new.  I will keep asking them questions until they ask me one.  That's a serious discipline for some of you.  Because we all want to shoot our mouth and tell a big story.  Learn to ask questions and listen.  And you learn so much about the other person.  And eventually, unless the person is a crushing bore, in which case you probably can forget about them because you'll never talk to them again, they will eventually ask you a question.  then answered briefly and start again asking questions.  just try it.  just try it.  it is just amazing because sometimes we get so pent up.  I don't know whether you've ever met Christians who change their tone of voice when they're talking about Christianity if they're talking about baseball or football or politics they have a normal voice but when they start to talk about God they terrify people.  We must learn to make God a natural part of our conversation.  But not be monomaniacs to talk about them all the time.  Nobody likes the monomaniac.  Only one subject.  And I always want to be the first to change the conversation when it gets on to God.  I want to be sure that the person's actually interested and is not just putting up with me.  And if I sense any push, I will stop and change the conversation.  And then if they say, no, no, no, I want to hear a bit more about this, then that's okay.  There are things you can learn to ease yourself out of your comfort zone into engaging with people outside.  Now, why did I say that?  Well, because the question was, can you be a Christian and not constantly asking questions?  Well, I suppose you can, but you'd be a very boring Christian. ",
