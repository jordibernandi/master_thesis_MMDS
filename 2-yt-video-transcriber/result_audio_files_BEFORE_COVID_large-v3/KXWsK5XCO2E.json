            "text": "hey how's it going running man?  so i don't know if it's because i'm here on vacation in australia and just really enjoying it or what.  but i had this dream and it was really vivid you know and i was uh back in my youth and i was.  i was uh i used to skateboard down hills right back.  then we'd ride you know half pipes and uh down hills and try to gun hills and then of course you each hit at the bottom because you're going too fast and the board speed wobbles all over the place and anyway.  but it was totally hopeless you know.  it's like if you ever did make it down to the bottom of a hill without eating shit.  nobody cared.  you know it was like you're just sitting there.  you know like you're almost traumatized because we'd go so fast and we'd have no pads at all like just sandals and shorts.  and when we ate shit it was like I remember one time I lost all my fingernails, you know, and ground down like part of my hand.  You know, it was like blood everywhere.  You know, that was like happened all the time.  This is before the Internet, guys.  So, you know, be grateful.  Oh, man.  I got a really bad story once.  But anyway, so I had this dream.  And in this dream, I was gunning this hill.  But it was funny because I wasn't on a skateboard in the dream.  I was on a big wheel.  It had these big plastic wheels, and I remember I did gun a hill on a big wheel once.  I took my foot off the pedals because you couldn't coast.  So anyway, I went down this one hill once, and I hit a fence, and my face almost got knocked off by a 2x4.  In this dream, I was on a big wheel, and it was a four-wheel big wheel, which doesn't make sense because there are three wheels.  But anyway, I was on a four-wheel big wheel, and I was going down this hill, and I remember looking to the left, and there was ice plant everywhere, which is a plant that was in California.  And it was real clear.  You know when you see something in a dream, it's like, fuck.  You see it almost like mist or dripping off of the plant, just clear as day.  Anyway, I looked over, I saw the ice plan.  That reminded me, okay, and now, you know, I'm back.  And I was gunning this hill and I was going down the hill.  As I went down the hill, I came flying by a policeman with like a radar thing.  And so he saw I was speeding or I wasn't supposed to be around the big view or whatever.  And then I came down to the bottom of the hill and I was going so fast, I was going to try to turn left, but... the road that I was going to turn left on, the big wheel has plastic wheels, right?  So there's no grip at all.  You can't, you know, you can't do a corner, right?  But I'm trying to make a corner.  So I look and I, and I can't make it.  So I, you know, I turned to try to try to turn up the left.  But it didn't work.  So then I went off the road into this... It was just rocks and ice plant flying up.  And I'm going really fast.  I'm probably going... In the dream, I'm probably going 70 miles an hour.  Stuff's just flying up.  Rocks are hitting me in the head.  And I'm going sideways.  I'm sliding sideways because there's another road parallel that I'm trying to turn left on that one.  And I think that was a road in my childhood that went up to my junior high school.  Real steep, steep road.  So anyway, so I'm going there and I can still see the cop.  The cop is now in front of me.  He's waiting for me, right?  And I'm going sideways and rocks are flying up and I'm holding on.  Just for dear life, you know, like, just totally doing the impossible.  Like, I'm going through this, like, this field, you know, with just, like, rocks and trees.  And, like, it's impossible what I'm doing.  But, you know, like, I'm holding on.  You know when, like, shit's hitting you in the face when you're a kid?  You know, like, you're just so... You're just totally fucked, right?  So anyway, so I'm doing that.  And I held on.  And then I hit the curb on the other side.  And I went over the curb.  I made it.  And then I slid and I went up the hill like I was supposed to be there, just like perfectly land, you know, stopped.  And then the cop was there.  And he gave me a ticket.  And then he... But I remember he looked at me with this look of... Even though he was giving me a ticket, he looked at me like, this kid's going to make it.  How the fuck did he do that?  You know, the cops, they're humans too, right?  And I think that's a metaphor for my life.  It's like, I'm trying to do something.  And, you know, it just totally doesn't work.  And then it's just like a matter of just fucking holding on, you know, and rocks hitting you in the face and just totally hopeless, you know, like where you just, you know, you can't do it.  There's no way through, you know, there's no way to get to the other side.  And just holding on, just fucking holding on.  And then making it, you know?  And I think that really is a metaphor for my life, you know?  And a lot of guys, I know that they're on Runnerman, like, have just been through kind of the impossible, you know?  It's like, you can't make that turn.  Like, plastic wheels don't grip.  You can't do that, you know?  But you do, you know?  And I think that's... Sometimes the biggest challenges or disasters end up being opportunities for people like us to survive and to actually make real changes.  uh, you know, like, like for example, like when you, when you reach a point when there is no option, right.  And you have to either kind of give up or fucking hold on.  Right.  That's the only choice.  Like you don't even have options yet.  Like you don't even see any options really.  I mean, you know what you're trying to do, but it's like, you don't, there's no realistic option to get to that point.  And I think, I think for men right now, like I'm here in Australia and I'm watching people.  I had this image of Australia as everybody's surfing and the girls blonde on the beach.  Really, I did.  Just because all the surf movies and everything I've watched in Australia.  And I'm here and it's like... The people are super cool and I'm having a great time.  And the beach that I'm at is awesome.  But at the same time, there's like a real... almost like America feeling to other parts of the country, right?  And it's like just strip malls and guys going to work and guys lugging Christmas trees.  You know, you see people in a rush, you know, things like that.  And it's like when you're in a state where you're somewhere where you don't want to be, you know, you just don't want to be there and you don't really have any clue, you know, how you're going to get out of it.  But you're willing to hold on, you know, you're willing to let the rocks hit you in the face and be totally clueless.  Like, just don't know.  Like, just don't fucking know.  Like, how does a man get free in today's society?  How the fuck does he do it?  Like, what what is the secret?  Like what?  There's?  no I don't have it.  Like, it's not.  sometimes it's fucking just holding on and knowing what you're aiming for.  You know what I mean?  You just don't know.  There's all types of guys I know listening.  Whatever the situation, you might not see any way out.  But the guys that are willing to hold on and willing to fucking be in the unknown... But at the same time, like, just know there's a better way of living than the way that everybody else is doing it.  There's a fucking better way like this for men, for women.  I think this society is fine.  Like they love shopping and, you know, sitting in coffee shops and, you know, I don't know, just doing stuff that everybody's just doing.  Like society is kind of made for women in a way, you know, they love it.  Shiny cars, everything, you know.  To me, it's meaningless.  I don't have any need for it.  But I think for men, like finding masculinity and being yourself and kicking ass and actually living a life that is worth it, you know, is sometimes really difficult to even imagine how it's going to unfold or even where it is.  Because everybody's got a different, you know, like every man has a different path.  You know, I can't.  You don't follow my path.  You don't follow any guy's path.  It's the spiritual path inside yourself.  That is the same.  That is definitely the same.  But the actual specifics is going to be different.  It's going to be different.  But I think that being forced into a very painful choice can be a real good opportunity.  And I just want to say quickly, uh, like for example, in my life, I was working as a headhunter in Tokyo, super stressed out.  And I, you know, I mean, I still have my image of myself as a surfer, like as a, as a relaxed paddling out.  Like we lived near the beach and like for most of my childhood, most of after, after everything in the trailer park and everything, we moved to California and it was, it was beautiful where we lived, you know?  And, I would look at the beach and I would go out there and we would paddle in the water and sun, you know, and just everything that you see on the beach.  And that was really my piece.  That was my.  that was where I proved myself.  That was where I challenged myself.  That's where my friends gathered.  And it was very.  it was very fucking awesome, you know, and there wasn't many women either.  Women did not go in the water back then.  You didn't see any women surfers.  I don't remember.  There was two chicks at my school that were, like, supposedly, like... I think they were, like... No, actually, not supposedly.  These chicks were good.  They were, like, twins, and they were, like, kicked ass in surfing.  But I guess they were number one in America.  I don't know.  Either way, they were up there.  So there was a couple women surfers, but I'd actually never surfed with them.  Come to think of it, they were never out when I was out.  But anyway, so... I was out with all guys, and it was just all men out in the water.  It was our own fucking community out there, you know?  Like, we helped each other, we saved each other, we did shit for each other, we made fun of each other, we challenged ourselves, we did everything out in the water.  And it wasn't this fucking strip mall fucking life, you know?  That wasn't my life, you know?  So it is, for me, like, finding... Finding my new path is... Because I don't consider myself... I consider myself a waterman now.  Not really a surfer, in a sense.  Although I do surf.  You know, I play golf.  I do a lot of things, but... It has not been my choice to go the way of, like, the daily surfer living right over the beach.  Like, I have a different path, although I like that path.  I think that path is a great path.  I see myself as different.  So, it's a subtle difference.  So, where you find that final, what do you call it?  Like, your... Your... whatever is it like that road, that final road that I found in the, in that dream, you know, where you find that final, like resting road where it's like, you're safe and comfortable, you know, that will be different.  And it's going to be not an easy road to find that.  you know?  And, uh, but I, I don't know.  Like, I think there's that you don't need a plan guys.  You don't need a fucking plan and you don't need to know what you're doing and you don't even need to be smart.  You don't need anything.  You need to know where you're going and you need to be able to hold on and need to freaking be around.  smart guys.  That's it.  You need, you need that.  You need other guys on the journey because you, It is really hard to do this thing without that really hard.  You need other guys with that kind of same mindset.  It's like, I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm going to get there.  I don't know how the fuck I'm going to do it.  You know, I don't know.  Oh yeah.  In Tokyo.  Yeah.  So I had a real quick, I, I thought of myself as a surfer, which is a relaxed guy, right?  It's a fucking, you know, and so what happened was I was headhunting and it was super stressful.  And all of a sudden I felt this, uh, feeling in my chest like I was gonna have a heart attack or something.  I was like I was only like 33. so I went to the doctor and he he treated me like shit really and he x-rayed me and then he said ah it's his stress And I had never been to the doctor.  In fact, ever since then either.  Where when I went in, it wasn't serious.  Because usually when I go to the doctor, it's fucking serious.  It's way overdue usually.  So this was the only time when I went in and he said, you know, it's nothing medical.  And I was like... embarrassed i was shocked you know i was like.  he said it's stress and so i quit.  my i quit actually headhunting and i went to india for four months bought a motorcycle got brought my surfboard surfed all up and down the coast went all over india man every fucking little.  oh it was awesome.  to the desert to pakistan and it was really great trip.  but it was because i realized that my stress had risen so high That if I didn't... If I didn't do anything now.  Make a big decision.  I was going to be one of these fucking drones on pills.  And all fucked up.  And I'm like, fuck this shit.  I ain't going to do this.  I am fucking out of here.  I'm making a decision.  And for me, I needed to go to India.  And that was an awesome decision for me.  And I came back.  And then I did headhunting again.  But I had a different mindset.  I understood that my body had limits and all that.  So, sometimes... An emergency can be good for you.  Sometimes it can be very good for you because it forces you to say, hey, fuck, this is not working.  So if that does happen, I really put it down if you had that happen before.  And I'm talking serious shit here.  I'm not talking like you decided to fucking get a painting or something.  You know what I mean?  I'm talking serious shit.  If you ever had that.  I'd love to hear what you learned and how it went down and what you thought at the time and all that.  Or if you're going through that now, by total coincidence, I'd love to hear how you're feeling about it.  But that's my thoughts today.  I'm really looking forward to fucking... The next couple days, I got a friend.  I'm going to see a family for Christmas.  And it's going to be awesome.  But anyway, signing off.  I just want to do a quick one.  And hope you guys are good.  I'm really looking forward to hanging out with you guys.  And we're going to do... I might... I'm going to... Hey, Sidney McDowell.  Maybe we should do a... Like an episode to kind of get ready for the summit.  If you're up for it.  Anyway, I'm out of here.  All right.  Have a good one, guys. ",
