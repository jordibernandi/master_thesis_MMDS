            "text": "Social media has created a false sense of reality and expectations for women, especially now in 2020, guys.  You guys know this.  I'm a guy that has been on social media myself, but I'm not on it too often.  But I see it all the time.  These women log on to social media and they're instantly are just in that mindset that This is how life is supposed to be.  They see these false Instagram lives and these false stories and projections on social media that aren't true and would drive, quite frankly, anyone insane to live such a perfect Photoshop lifestyle.  You know what I'm saying?  It's not reality.  And these women have trouble discerning that this social media life and then real life as it is In person, they're two completely different things, guys.  And these women don't understand that.  They literally use social media for validation for men.  And they will do anything to ensnare the man that's working hard and that's on his mission and that's on his grind.  Because, quite frankly, they have no other better things to do.  And they have nothing going for themselves.  So what they want to do is they want to make sure that the Alpha, they can trap the Alpha and snare him and knock him off his grind in order to focus all his attention on them.  But little do they know that will never happen with the true Alpha.  A true Alpha will always lead and she will always have to follow the true Alpha.  You should always lead as an alpha.  If you're watching this channel, you should be an alpha male.  I'm talking to all my alpha males on this channel, guys.  All 34 of you guys, or how many subscribers I'll have by the time this video goes up, I'm talking to you guys.  You need to be on your grind.  You need to be working hard because this shit is getting harder, guys.  It's 2020 right now and social media, more social media apps, more dating apps are created every single week, every single day, every single month and this shit gets harder.  It's not going to get easier.  It's not.  I wish it could get easier.  Hypergamy is real.  If you don't know what hypergamy is, look it up.  I'll explain it right now briefly because a lot of you guys probably already know what hypergamy is.  But it's basically when a woman can monkey branch or find a better option, a better deal, a better man when she's with the one that she's with.  She's always looking for that better deal and that better opportunity than the person she's with.  And it's just subconsciously going on in her mind just as a woman.  She's always looking for that provider or the next guy to monkey branch to.  In the words of a lot of dating coaches and other red pill channels.  But, guys, social media, for real, guys, it's only getting worse.  Time is ticking before this shit just explodes.  It's already exploding slowly.  And I would just say stay off of social media for as much as you can.  If you do post and you do get comments from women... Just ignore them.  Don't reply.  It's just feeding their egos.  and their heads are so fucking huge right now, guys.  Their heads are massive and literally all the validation they can receive is in social media and they literally don't even have to go out and talk to guys anymore.  They don't have to look for validation because all they have to do is pop out their phones Open it up and they have like fucking 15 to 20 messages every single day from any guy that they want.  Well, from even guys that they don't even want, honestly.  So these women don't have to do anything.  They don't have to put out because social media has allowed them to receive all the attention from all these men at once.  And it's quite frankly just getting worse and worse, guys.  Stay off of social media.  Keep going your own way.  Keep taking the red pill, guys.  All 2020.  And stay on your grind.  Stay on your hustle.  You should always be working on something.  Let her follow your lead.  Do not chase. ",
