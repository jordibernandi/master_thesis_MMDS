Well, Donald Trump was asked about that at a meeting yesterday.  It was this faith-based meeting.  There were some kids there.  And here's what he said.  were all about 2020.

Don't know what he's about.  Don't know where he comes from.  Know nothing about him.  I can only tell you this thing is a big hoax.  It's a big hoax.  We call it, this is the current hoax.  We've gone through the Russian witch hunt.  We've gone through a lot of them from probably before I came down the escalator.  But certainly since I came down the escalator, you take a look at what's happened.  And in the meantime, our country, it doesn't matter what he says.  He's trying to probably make a deal for himself.  I don't even know who this man is, but I don't know him.  I had never had a conversation that I remember with him. ",

It was a stupid, stupid own goal, but you did it.  And okay, so what's interesting there, though, is that when Kellyanne Conway was responding to Lev Parnas' claims about whether Donald Trump was aware of what was going on, she was very careful and would not say on the record whether he did or not.  In terms of whether he even knows who this person is, Donald Trump was not backing off from that and said many times, I don't know him, I don't know who he is, I don't know his name, I don't know any of that.  Does that represent new knowledge or just a willingness of Donald Trump to lie that Kellyanne Conway would not? ",

It is also inherently weak because of how he freaks out when people confront him over it.  Quiet.  Yeah.  Quiet.  But he always does this.  He always says, I don't know the person.  Yeah.  He always, that is his default response.  He did it with Sondland.  He's done it with countless other people.  I don't know the guy.  I don't know about this.  I don't know about WikiLeaks.  I don't know about anything.  So when he says stuff, when he's confronted with it, that's his default response until he has to change his tune, which has happened with all those other things and will continue to happen.  And one thing that's very frustrating, and this is kind of a theme, is that he's gonna tell you, and people on the right have tried to convince you, that he's Lev Parnas does not deserve any credibility whatsoever.  There's one huge exception.  There's one thing they can't make you overlook, which is Giuliani hired him.  Yeah.  Your team, who you say deserves credibility, hired this guy that by your own claims has no credibility.  And then also when Trump says- So why did he do that?  And then also, Trump, there's so many hoaxes.  Maybe, have you ever considered that all these things that you consider to be hoaxes Maybe the fact that they keep coming up, it's actually you, they might actually be true.  He wants us to believe that every single thing that comes up surrounding this guy when it comes to unethical behavior and allegations of the same, that it's all made up.  But there's so many things, it can't possibly all be made up.  Especially when in the impeachment trial and the impeachment hearings leading up to it, they never disputed the facts.

Why would we care about Lev Parnas when Rudy Giuliani was working with and good friends with Lev Parnas?  Still has barely distanced himself from him even now.  And obviously, Rudy Giuliani still has the full confidence of Donald Trump so far as we know.  So here he is asked about Rudy Giuliani.  He wrote a letter to Zelensky requesting a private meeting and he said it was in his capacity as private counsel to President Donald J. Trump.  This was before the inauguration.

Yeah.  So he sent Rudy Giuliani and whoever the hell Rudy needed to hire, because he knows that Rudy Giuliani has mortgaged all credibility that he had in America as America's mayor in the wake of 9-11.  He went and turned into the swamp creature you see before you today.  And he said, just go get an investigation announced.  Say that they're looking into Biden.  Say that they're looking into Burisma.  Yeah.  And there's two reasons that Biden's going down in the polls.
