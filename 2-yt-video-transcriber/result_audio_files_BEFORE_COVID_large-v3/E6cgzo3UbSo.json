            "text": "All esteem to the Most High Elohim.  This is your brother El.  Family, some of our people just simply do not learn the lesson.  What I want to speak on today is a message that I really truly hope reaches a lot of the brothers and sisters who are new to this walk.  in regards to the false prophecy that's circulating around where you have some of these Hebrews saying that on August the 20th, that the tribes are going to be regathered, that Babylon is going to be destroyed.  They went from putting their year on it of 2019 to now they putting the exact date out there of August 20th.  So I just want to come go through some scriptures for brothers and sisters so that nobody out there that is naive or new to the walk gets wrapped up in this foolishness and this deception.  If y'all go back in my archive and check out a video I did two years ago called Beware of the 2019 Prophecies.  where you got folks out there that are saying, because this is the 400th year that we've been in the Americas, that this is going to be the year that Babylon is destroyed, that the tribes are regathered and that the people of the most high go off into the wilderness.  They putting dates on this.  And in that video, I thoroughly explained why that is a false prophecy.  that is going to cause many people's hopes to be disappointed.  Whenever I released that video a couple years back, If people went into an uproar saying you misleading the people, you a false prophet, you trying to destroy our hopes, you lying to the people.  I was getting cussed out in the comment section by putting that video out to warn our people that they were getting set up for a disappointment.  They were getting set up for a false hope and that false prophets and prophecy pimps was misleading them.  Well, here we are in 2019 and those same folks that was quitting their jobs, running off to Ghana, running off to Ethiopia because somebody had them pumped up that this was going to be the year that the Messiah gathered the tribes and Babylon was going to be destroyed.  As you can see, here we are and they're stuck looking like dodo birds with egg on their face after being totally misled.  But I guess some folks are just a glutton for punishment because now we got this August 20th prophecy that they're putting out there now as if people have not learned their lesson yet.  Family.  Those of you, especially that's new to this walk, don't get wrapped up in a lot of this hype.  of people setting dates and putting false prophecies out there.  Because what's taking place is they're being used of the enemy to make this walk be evilly spoken of.  They're being used of the enemy to set a snare for people's feet of getting them hyped up only to get disappointed.  I've said it and I've said it again.  The track record of many of these so-called Hebrews and trying to prophesy is not good whatsoever at all.  Back in the year 2000, There was one of the main Hebrew camps, not going to say no names, that prophesied that the Messiah was going to return in the year 2000, that the tribes was going to be regathered in the year 2000, that Babylon was going to fall in the year 2000, telling Negroes that the chariots was going to come pick them up.  The same thing they're saying about this year.  Negroes was quitting their jobs, leaving their families, and nothing happened.  Not a damn thing happened in 2000.  And they were stuck yet again looking like dodo birds, looking like doofuses and straight doofuses.  Just straight goofballs.  It happened in 2000.  Fast forward, 2012.  They was pushing that in 2012.  The tribes was gonna be regathered.  The Messiah was gonna return.  Babylon was gonna be destroyed.  The chariots was gonna come pick them up.  2012 came and went.  2016, the exact same Negroes that was wrong about 2000 and wrong about 2012 then started teaching that the election was going to be suspended, that it was going to be global martial law.  Babylon was going to be destroyed.  The tribes was going to be regathered.  The Messiah was going to return and the chariots was going to come pick folks up and take them to the wilderness.  That didn't happen.  And these exact same Negroes that was wrong about 2000, wrong about 2012, wrong about 2016 are the exact same ones now saying that on August 20th of this year, that the tribes is going to be regathered, that the Messiah is going to return, that Babylon is going to be destroyed, and that the chariots of the most high is going to pick up the people of the most high and take them to the wilderness.  Family, don't be a doofus.  Don't be a goofball.  Don't be a dodo bird by listening to these folks.  Very rarely have they ever been right about anything whatsoever at all as it pertains to prophecy.  So those of you that's new in this walk, I just wanted to come give you edification not to get wrapped up in this nonsense of these people.  And I'm even going to re-upload the video that we did about beware of the 2019 prophecies.  I'm going to re-upload the video because evidently too many of our people have not learned our lesson.  And that video got a lot of hits.  It got put out there a lot.  And like I said, people was in the comment section sending curses at me, cussing me out, saying I'm a liar, saying I'm an agent.  And a few of them same Negroes that swore this was going to be the year, quitting their jobs and all that, now in a situation begging for rent money because they quit jobs, they made all these rash decisions because they thought the chariots was going to come get them.  But If we looked at scriptures, we would know that the Messiah warned us about false prophets and the great falling away.  Matthew chapter 24, starting at verse four, listen to what the Messiah says.  And the Messiah answered and said unto them, take heed that no man deceive you.  So the Messiah tells us, take heed that no man deceive you.  Meaning in these times, it's gonna be a lot of deceivers.  It's gonna be a lot of liars.  It's gonna be a lot of prophecy pimps.  It's gonna be a lot of these Negroes, especially the ones online, That's another reason why I tell brothers and sisters, be careful of these Facebook pages and all these different channels hopping from video to video because you're listening to folks that don't know half what they're talking about, telling you the chariots is going to come get you on August 20th, not knowing that these were the same folks that had people all hyped up about the other dates and nothing came to pass.  So be very wise in these times.  And I know even the more I give that warning, it's still going to be people that refuse common sense, wise counsel and discernment.  Still, they're going to refuse.  And that's on them, though, because the Messiah said in Matthew 24, 11 and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many.  The reason that these false prophets is getting pushed to the forefront and these prophecy pimps, the reason they getting pushed to the forefront, because as I said, the enemy is using them to get people hyped up about certain events happening on certain dates.  So when it doesn't manifest like it never does every time these folks make prophecies.  People get offended.  People fall away from the Most High.  And the narrow path of righteousness, they begin to mock and scoff at it.  Just like they do with these Christians trying to predict all these rapture dates that never come to pass.  And it's a whole load of them on YouTube.  It's a whole load of these Christian false prophets.  And it's a whole load of these Hebrew false prophets.  over these videos getting people pumped up and then when nothing happens now they bitter at the most high.  now they don't quit jobs dropped out of programs to get certification where they can learn a trade to feed their family dropping out of schools dropping out of jobs leaving families running off to Israel.  which Family, let's go to some more scriptures about this.  Let's go to Acts chapter one, starting at verse four, because I want to make sure I stay in the spirit with giving this discussion so that I be above reproach.  Because what we see going on here, family, is that the enemy has a grip on the minds of many.  And it's a lot of just flat out mental illness going on amongst folks that's claiming to be of the way.  It's a lot of just flat out mental illness going on because there's no reason that a sane, discerning, sober minded person after seeing these false prophets and these prophecy pimps get these prophecies wrong every single time that they would turn around and believe them again.  It don't make no sense.  Acts chapter one, starting at verse four.  Listen to this.  It says, and being assembled together with them, the Messiah commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the father, which say of he, ye have heard of me.  For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Ruach HaKadosh not many days hence.  Now, this is when the Messiah was about to ascend to the right hand of the father.  Listen to the conversation he had with the disciples because he's telling us the same thing today.  And the thing he was telling them is not to get caught up in dates because they don't know the times and the dates.  But still, you got dodo birds, goofballs, doofuses and stooges.  that are still getting wrapped up in this date setting stuff.  Even though the Messiah and all the ancestors warned against the foolishness.  It says, when they therefore will come together, they ask of him saying, Messiah, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?  And he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father have put in his own power.  These was the disciples, the originals, the Messiah's A1s.  If anybody should have deserved to get told that the dates when all the prophecies would be fulfilled, it would be them.  And the Messiah even told them, it's not for you to know these dates and times and seasons.  So let me let me get this straight.  Peter wasn't good enough to know the times and seasons.  John wasn't good enough.  James, all these brothers who died as martyrs for the Messiah and they received the same baptism the Messiah received.  They weren't even being been counted worthy to know the exact dates and times that the father would fulfill what he say he fulfilled.  But let me guess, some Negro on YouTube or Facebook knows the exact date even when Paul, James, and John and all those brothers didn't know.  Nah, them Negroes don't know either.  And I'm telling you, they're being used of the enemy to get you pumped up, to get you hyped up.  And then when nothing happens, now you offended at the most high.  Now you ready to fall away because you let your guard down and listen to some Negroes or Negresses that didn't know what they was talking about.  See how that works.  And the Torah warns us against this as well.  I'm not going to spend too much time on this because people that know the ministry that I bring forth, they know that I've always warned against this.  I'm just rehashing this again for the new people that's new in the walk, that when they see this foolishness, they don't get misguided with it.  But I'm actually to the point where I'm tired even speaking on it.  Because if people want to be dodo birds, if people want to lack discernment, then that's on them to do that.  Eventually, they're going to have to learn the hard way.  But listen to what the Torah has to say about false prophets, a.k.a.  prophecy pimps.  Let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 18, starting at verse 20.  This is the law.  Listen to what it says here.  But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.  Listen to this.  So the father put an immediate death sentence on all these false prophets and people setting dates and nothing coming to pass.  According to Torah, these people deserve the death sentence because they misled the most highest flock.  They got people pumped up only to get disappointed.  So all you people out there that's pushing these false dates and these false prophecies, you bring in death on yourself by doing that and you don't even know it.  That's why I'm taking you to these scriptures to show you how serious this is.  But I realize that's still not going to make Negro stop.  But on Judgment Day, it's not going to be said that I didn't tell you.  The blood ain't going to be on my hands.  Verse 21.  And if thou say in thine heart, how shall we know the word which the Most High have not spoken?  Verse 22.  When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Most High.  If the thing follow not nor come to pass, that is the thing which the most high have not spoken.  But the prophet have spoken it presumptuously.  Thou shall not be afraid of him.  So Deuteronomy chapter 18, starting at verse 20, gives you the protocol on how to weed out these false prophets.  If folks is out here making prophecies that don't come to pass, that's your cue that they're a false prophet.  cut and dry, simple and plain.  So when these folks got it wrong back in the year 2000, that should have already been it, that nobody listens to them.  no more about anything pertaining to prophecy.  Then when they got it wrong in 2012 and then in 2016, that should have definitely been people signed not to listen no more.  So I just wanted to go through these scriptures once again, family, to let you know the litmus test of true prophets from false prophets.  And I would venture to say that about 95 percent of these folks in the quote unquote Hebrew community that try to put forth prophecies, not many of them are moving under the spirit of the true Ruach HaKadosh.  Not many of them are moving under the true Holy Spirit.  And even the book Martyrdom of Isaiah tells us this, that in these times there would be very few who truly have faith.  heard and are hearing prophetic word from the father.  For it says in martyrdom of Isaiah chapter three, verse 11, in those days, there will not be many prophets nor such as speak reliable words, except one here and there in different places.  So family, most of these folks is false.  That's trying to set these dates.  Let me tell you, August 20th is going to come and go just like the year 2000 did, just like 2012 did, just like the election of 2016, just like you see 2019 has been going.  Even though when I released the video about beware of the 2019 prophecies, Negroes swore I was misleading the people.  They swore I was an agent.  They swore that I was trying to dash people hopes.  Now those same ones are nowhere to be found.  I've even seen some of these folks that was talking that they ain't even doing their Shabbat classes no more.  They so ashamed and embarrassed that they sit folks off on a dummy mission that they have.  They've been canceling their Shabbat classes.  So once again, family, be wise, be discerning.  Don't get wrapped up in these folks setting dates.  The minute somebody starts throwing out dates to you, that's the minute that you know, okay, this is a false spirit because the scripture says not even the Messiah knows that day or that hour.  And even when you bring things up to them like this, Many of them are still going to be under the delusion.  They'll still try to come with the whole, well, you know, we can know the times and the seasons and this and that.  And they'll start bringing out the Enoch calendar and doing all this complex mathematics.  But the fact that still remains and that's staring everybody in the face.  is that they've never been right.  No matter how much they pull the e-note calendar, all these algebra and all these different math equations they try to use, the flat-out fact still staring us all in the face is that they've rarely ever been right.  So family, I'm going to go ahead and upload that video again about the beware of the 2019 prophecies.  Please check it out.  For those of you that haven't heard it and those of you that's new to the walk, please don't get wrapped up in this nonsense and this deception that folks is pushing about August 20th this year.  Please.  Shalom. ",
