            "text": "So we've talked about this topic many times before, but why this is interesting is because CEE, NBC, and there's other news sites that have reported on this before about people getting chipped, getting a microchip, and it's actually happened.  I posted a video of it before.  I think it was Wisconsin or something like that.  Not exactly sure I can repost it.  But there were people who were already receiving a chip and they were using this chip, you know, to have information on it and things like that.  And what's so amazing about it is this is not, you know.  Some fluky news site reporting this and this is not, you know, even Christians that are reporting this kind of stuff.  So what you need to understand is I always tell you guys the devil takes little ground, little territory and you don't notice it.  You say, well, you know, okay, I actually see people standing in a line getting chipped on the news because Oh, that's not really a big deal because, you know, well, they're not making people do it.  It is a big deal because that's how the enemy works.  The enemy's never going to be like, you know, the Wizard of Oz, just behind the curtain, boom, move the curtain, here I am.  Just little territory here and there.  Now, let me show you.  For example, your cell phone, right?  Your cell phone, it can pretty much, they can watch you through your phone.  We've seen Snowden talk about this because your phone is connected to what?  The internet, right?  So whenever they want to tap into your phone and watch through your camera, have you ever watched that movie with Snowden?  If you don't know who Snowden is, look him up.  You know, he used to cover up the camera with tape and stuff like that because they have those capabilities.  You can take a picture on Facebook, brand new picture with you and other individuals like I took when I was at the concert last night and Facebook can identify the people who are in the picture with you.  That's kind of, you know, it's wild, right?  So think about it this way.  I know that when I was a kid, a lot of the things that we talked about, you know, you had the Left Behind series and things like that.  It was just like, man, that's something off in the future.  But now the technology that we have, we see these things becoming a reality.  And everything that the Bible talks about, right?  You've seen I shared the verse about effeminate man not entering the kingdom and things like that.  Everything the Bible talks about is literally happening right in front of us.  But one, people don't want to see it.  Two, It's not happening how they thought it was going to happen.  The Bible says that they will call good evil and evil good and that they would give into doctrines of devils and seducing spirits.  So the way the enemy comes, he's going to come looking like this good thing.  He's going to come looking like an angel of light.  And because it doesn't happen that way, people are confused.  People are looking for the devil to show up and they want to be easily able to identify that is the devil.  But that's not.  he's a master at what he does.  Let me tell you something.  This guy, Jesse Smollett, Smollett, whatever his name is.  He had all these people fooled and angry and upset.  He told you, look, these guys attack me.  They scream MAGA and everybody's believing him.  If you have no discernment when it comes to stupid stuff like that, the Antichrist is going to have no problem fooling you.  Now, some of you say, well, you know, I'm not looking for the Antichrist.  Who is the Antichrist?  Is it Trump?  Is it Obama?  Look, let me tell you something.  The Bible says the spirit of the Antichrist is already moving among the earth.  What does that mean?  Think about it this way.  The spirit of the Antichrist is already setting things up for the Antichrist to come out.  All right.  So the way that I always like to.  present it to people imagine that the antichrist right he's coming.  the bible already prophesied the end times and stuff like that.  so he says boom all right i'm gonna send my workers out to start building the platform and building the stage.  how do you think that the world is going to witness the two witnesses dying and raising up again?  that we see in revelations Social media, right?  It it's like people don't seem to get it and they don't understand like when the Bible describes this stuff even when when they are.  You know the way that John is describing some of the things in Revelation the best that he could With you know the place that he was living in But things like that the two witnesses dying and the whole world's gonna know about it that they were brought back to life and all that kind of social media.  And so people say, well, you know, is the chip the marker of the beast?  Let me tell you something.  I don't per se, I'm not going to say yes or no, that it's the mark of the beast.  What I will say is we're moving into a cashless society.  Look at how Walmart and McDonald's and all these places, they don't even have workers anymore.  Everything is being computerized, right?  Even Amazon has a store where you can walk in and you can grab something off the shelf and walk out and your phone automatically pays for it, right?  So everything becomes a cast of society.  They can track you with your phone.  They can see your location, where you are, when you post a picture.  What does all that kind of mean?  Especially when you have also all this stuff going on with the police, right?  The police, there's all this division and tension.  All that stuff opens the door for martial law.  All that stuff gives them more power.  You know, they talk about wanting to take away people's guns.  They get more power.  They get more control.  We have certain people getting into office with no conscience of God.  They can pass laws and pass legislation that affects you as a believer.  So what do you think?  You think that all of this stuff is just some, you know, I don't need to pay attention to it.  Oh, that sounds crazy.  No, man, you got to pay attention to it.  All of these things are more measures for them to control, more measures for them to track.  And yeah, it might sound like, you know, it's a movie or something, but that's exactly what the devil wants you to think.  He wants you to sit there and think, oh, yeah, man, I don't have to pay attention.  There's literally people.  Think about it.  Think about how crazy this is, how the Bible talks about.  people have a strong delusion.  Most Christians do believe, you know, like getting chipped or something would be the mark of the beast.  I'll give you an example.  Visa.  I remember when I was in South Korea a couple years ago.  They had some article about how they were designing a chip.  And the crazy thing was they were like, we're going to implant it.  I forgot if it was your left or right hand.  But they were like, if for some reason you were missing the hand, they would implant it in the forehead.  This was like an article from Visa a couple years ago, man.  And I just thought that was crazy.  But... As believers, we don't have to be scared.  We don't have to be afraid.  You know, the Bible already says these things was going to be happening.  But I talk about this stuff because I want you to understand the Bible says, be not ignorant of Satan's devices.  Everything that you see happening, you think it's a little thing.  You think it's a little detail.  You think it's not a big deal.  All of it is building a stage.  And maybe just because you're seeing one corner of the stage, one corner of the platform, you're thinking, man, that's, you know, that's not really a big deal to me.  But it really is a big deal, guys.  Even when you see things like the the Christians who are going to the Supreme Court and getting sued and stuff like that Just watch it's like the way that I see it is the enemy has.  How would you say?  Put it this way, like this is what I can show you how I see it in my mind.  There's all these lines, right?  Like kind of like train tracks.  All of these lines are kind of moving toward this center point, but it's all coming from different directions, right?  So we see what's happening in our society.  We see what's happening in America.  We see what's happening with technology.  We see what's happened with division.  We see what happened against, you know, the cops.  We see what's happening with young people.  No respect for authority.  No respect for teachers.  No respect for police.  Rebel, rebel, rebel.  And all of these different things are kind of just pulling us to what the Bible already said was going to happen.  You don't even have to be a Bible scholar.  So imagine, just imagine this in your mind.  360 of a bunch of red lines just coming from every different direction.  and the enemy has slowly but surely everywhere he can get his foot in his foot in the schools his foot in the compromised churches foot in politics and all of that stuff is coming to a center point which is all just biblical prophecy.  and then when it meets boom now it makes sense.  When they start tripping people, when they start making laws and legislations to tell you to bow down, then it's like, oh, now it makes sense.  But I was ignorant to Satan's devices because I thought, oh, it wasn't a big deal when they did that.  It wasn't a big deal when we voted that person in.  It wasn't a big deal when they took prayer out of the schools.  It wasn't a big deal when they started forcing the LGBTQ curriculum.  That's exactly what the enemy wants you to think.  And it's not to be afraid or to be scared because God is in control, but don't be ignorant.  You don't want to be ignorant because if you're ignorant, you can be easily deceived because you think, oh, it's not a big deal.  This is just technology.  It's just an advancement.  Okay, yeah, let me get chipped.  So this is something to think about.  Like I said, with your phones, man, you can do everything from your phone.  And so it's kind of like the cell phone's been warming you up, right?  You communicate.  You can call people all over the country.  You can pay for things on your phone.  You just tap your phone.  Next thing they're going to say is, hey, man, let's take the whole phone.  And notice how they keep, you know, cell phones was like really, really big back in the day.  And they keep getting smaller and smaller and more advanced.  Pretty soon they're going to say, look, we can take this whole phone and we can just put it right here.  And then all you got to do is just, you know, tap, tap here and go to the store and just scan your hand.  Right.  Walmart, McDonald's.  You see all these self-checkout lines.  Think about it, man.  It's not to scare you, man.  It's just something to, you know, something for you to pray about.  Love you guys. ",
