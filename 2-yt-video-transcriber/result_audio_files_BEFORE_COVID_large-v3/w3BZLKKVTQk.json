            "text": "Hey guys, it's your favorite ex-communist soda slurping Twitter tweeting fat YouTuber here.  I mean, it's your old pal C-Animal here.  Anyways, today we'll be talking about another quite well-fed gent, Mao Zedong.  So, it turns out that this guy, Mao Zedong, was weirder than my friend Thaddeus, and trust me, Takes quite a lot to be weirder than my friend Thaddeus.  So, let's get into this.  So, it turns out, so, Mao Zedong, when he was 68, he married a 14-year-old girl.  Now, Jason Unra, if you're watching this, and basically all tankies, please let that sink in.  Mao Zedong, someone you consider an example of Marxist perfectionism, married a 14-year-old when he was 68 years old.  A 68-year-old marrying a 14-year-old?  Pleb, the real real libertarian god would be 95 years old when he marries a three-year-old.  Yes, the age of consent should be one picosecond.  So thirdly, Mao barely brushed his teeth.  All he would do was rinse his mouth out with tea in the morning.  So he was also quite pretentious.  And because of how little he brushed his teeth, his teeth were green and rotting and his gums oozed pus.  So this man had quite the dental hygiene.  Well, his teeth were on the green rotting and oozing pus.  Man, that guy can't do well hygienically.  You know what?  He must be one of them intellectual elitists, because being smart is bad.  I teach my kids that.  I teach them to throw tomatoes and throw hammers at the kid reading a book on Nietzsche.  Screw smart people.  Anyways, my teeth are barely there.  They're hanging on by a thread.  They use blood just about every day.  I'm the true working class American.  Fourthly, Mao Zedong was once given 40 mangoes by a Pakistani minister.  And he, as a sign of his dedication to the working class, gave some Chinese factory workers some of the mangoes.  Now when they got them, they took this as a sign, as a divine sign of Mao's greatness because no one in China had ever eaten mangoes before.  And because the mangoes were so sweet, they took it as a divine sign that Mao was great.  And so the workers founded a literal cult Dedicated to the mangoes and the guy was wanted that executed for comparing the mango to a sweet potato.  so Jason Unruh Remember you think this guy led a successful government.  and Fifthly, before becoming a communist activist and then later politician, Marx did try his hand in many other careers, including, and I kid you not, business.  Let that sink in.  Mao Zedong, the crazy communist dictator of China from 1949 to 1976, almost became a businessman.  Alright, so guys, I was thinking about putting our stock market... Wait, guys, do you hear that?  I think it's some... Oh my god, guys, there are a bunch of communists protesting.  Nope, screw all of you.  I'm going to become a communist dictator.  Once I gain power, you're all going to prison camps.  Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the video.  Have a nice day.  And if you're watching it as soon as it came out, have a nice weekend. ",
