And here we are at our four minute mark.  You see what I mean?  I would love to keep going if you want to.  Yeah.

Whether a person believes there's no God, or a person believes that Vishnu is the real God, or a person believes that Allah is the right God.  Acknowledging that people can believe things that aren't true, do you want to hold beliefs that are true? ",

That's really useful for not only building rapport, but also for... getting an assessment of uh of what his limitations are with his hypothesis.  so would he walk into his pre-med classes with the same sort of hypothesis that i'm going to believe that this is true even though i'll never know that it's the case.  i'm going to derive happiness from it.  i might derive benefit from it.  I think we could probably end up utilizing that later if he does come back.  It was also nice that he was Muslim.  I don't get a chance to meet a lot of Muslims out here.  And some of the ones that I have met contact me later to say, please take down the video because we're getting pressure from our family and friends about it.  So that was really enjoyable.  I hope I run into him again and we can delve a little bit deeper into this.  discussion and why questioning might pull him away from happiness.  I think it would probably be important to acknowledge that, yes, uncertainty and asking questions and maybe not even getting answers to them could result in unhappiness.  It's an unpleasant feeling to not know how things are operating and to struggle to come up with answers or to have to set things aside because we don't currently understand how it works or what the answers are.  So I think I would acknowledge that feeling that can be elicited when somebody does question.  But is the feeling so uncomfortable to the point where you are comfortable believing things that aren't true?  And it seems currently at the moment that Zane is.  So hopefully we meet again.  I probably wouldn't upload this video and take the time to edit it unless he does come back for more conversations and we see some progress on that front.  Stop! ",
