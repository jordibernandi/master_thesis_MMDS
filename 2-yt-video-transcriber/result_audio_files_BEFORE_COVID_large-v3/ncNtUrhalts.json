            "text": "Hi beautiful people.  Before we get into anything, last week I compared radical feminism to MGTOW, calling both movements toxic.  For this, some of you guys were really upset with me.  I always try to be so careful to give you guys accurate information, but this time I messed up.  To clear this up, I actually wanted to say fema plus this, but I get demonetized so often.  I was trying to avoid that word.  So I used the word radical as a synonym for extreme.  This was to address the women who genuinely hate men, who want them castrated, who are comparable to the MGTOW movement.  But choosing the word radical inadvertently misrepresented a movement with a rich and primarily positive history.  I encourage you all to learn about radical feminism itself and form an opinion on your own.  Check out the links below.  Which brings me to the fact that God is Gray is actually a learning experience, not only for you guys, but for myself.  Sometimes I will run the risk of misrepresenting these ideas that I am grappling so hard to understand, especially when subjects are brand new to me.  So I thank any of you that called this out, and I thank you for the opportunity to give clarity when I do mess things up.  This is why I'd love for more of you to download the God is Great podcast.  I use that platform to host an array of people and perspectives, to tell stories that welcome diversity into the God is Great conversation.  This week I interviewed comedian Matt Legrand.  He's a former missionary kid with a wild tale about the loss of his virginity and what it's like to be closeted in the Christian community.  I'll give you a hint, it's painful.  Our conversation is both heart-wrenching and hilarious, so go check it out.  Now, last week I dove into the toxic us versus them mentality overrunning our culture and conversations today.  I asked that you guys elevate your communication and be more compassionate in your disagreements.  And your response was overwhelmingly positive.  You guys made me fall even more deeply in love with the Goddess Grey community.  Many of you pledged to do better, to lead your conversations with love and compassion, and that is amazing.  So this week, I wanted to show you guys loving disagreement at work. ",

I am again going to link you to the wellspring of amazing resources linked below.  These are Christian, Bible-based resources.  And any of you who have said, Bible is my only authority, that's the only thing I'll read.  on the subject of homosexuality, I need you to consider the truth.  Everything you have ever been taught about homosexuality and the Bible has come from a human being's interpretation of the Bible.  And that the word homosexuality wasn't added to the Bible until 1946.  So get your head out of your behinds and get to researching.  And if you saw last week's video, you know that the Bible refers to Satan as Diabolos, which means the divider.  Keeping that in mind, listen to this. ",

As always, I encourage all of you guys to pursue your own relationship with the Holy Spirit.  But no matter what you do, do it in love.  We are called to represent Jesus on this earth.  He died for us, he loves us, and we need to be doing our best to reflect that love.  And that's it.  I love you guys.  Thank you so much for watching.
