The shortage drives up prices and some living on the margins are priced out and turned to the streets.  And even after voters approved the more than a billion dollars specifically to build housing for the increasing homeless population, a recent report by LA's controller's office attributed the delays and cost overruns largely to regulatory barriers permitting challenges, and bureaucratic confusion.
