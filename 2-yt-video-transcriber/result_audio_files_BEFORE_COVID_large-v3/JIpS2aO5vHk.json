            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to New Guy Stuff Review.  Today's product is the Two Slice Toaster Keenstone Retro Stainless Steel Bread Toaster with Cancel Bagel, Defrost Function, and 6 Browning Settings, 1.5 inch extra wide slots, removable crumb tray blue by Keenstone.  And yes, the day has finally happened.  I'm reviewing a toaster.  It's just a toaster.  It's not like a crazy contraption.  It toasts bread and makes toasts.  It's a stainless steel.  You can see the construction.  It's all stainless steel.  It's about comparable.  I have my actual toaster here.  We're going to do a side by side of the toaster that I currently have to the Keenstone.  The toaster I have is a $50 Bella toaster.  And this toaster costs about $35.  I do have a 15% off coupon code.  And I would say this toaster is better than the $50 Bella toaster.  So TLDR, if you don't want to watch the rest of the review, it's a toaster.  If you're in the market for a toaster, this is the equivalent of a $50 or higher toaster for $35.  So if you're in the market for a toaster, that's really all you need to hear.  Okay.  So it has the stainless steel kind of retro look.  It's gonna be hard for me to kind of get this in the screen, Because my camera is not made for this sort of review.  It's more for top-down stuff.  But it's all metal.  I don't see any plastic.  Maybe on the bottom.  The bottom is the only plastic I see.  Other than that, it's metal.  And you can see with the Bella.  So the Bella is all stainless steel too.  It is old.  So, I mean, I didn't clean it or anything.  It's a toaster.  But the components are very similar.  I see pretty similar components in both toasters.  This is why I can say with confidence is the equivalent of a $50 toaster.  The controls are equivalent.  Now, again, it has three modes.  It has defrost mode.  So if you have like frozen bagels or frozen bread, you can actually toast this in the toaster with one step.  It'll defrost the bread and toast it.  You can also hit cancel if you want the toast to stop cooking.  And then you could just do regular toasting.  There's six browning settings.  And this is for both.  Okay.  The browning settings is interesting.  It actually came with an insert going over the different browning settings.  I thought that was interesting.  It even has like a sugary bread.  And then the other side has sugar-free bread.  I didn't even know that was a thing.  So it kind of gives you a look of like, what type of toast do you want?  What do you want your toast to look like based on the browning settings?  I've never seen something like that.  So that's kind of interesting.  The mechanism works really good.  Like let's compare it.  So here again, we have a $50 Bella toaster.  We have the $35 Keenstone toaster.  You can kind of hear the mechanism going.  exactly the same.  It has the dials for both.  It has the buttons for both.  It has the settings for both.  I can't really see a difference other than just basic aesthetic.  If you like the retro look, then the Keenstone is good.  The components look pretty the same.  They look like they're equivalent.  So essentially, I mean, this is gonna... I know this is kind of boring.  It's a toaster.  You're getting a $50 toaster for $35.00.  So if you're in the market for a toaster, it's a toaster.  It's a $50 toaster.  that the equivalent, you're getting the quality of a $50 toaster for $15 less.  And then with the coupon code, you'll save an additional 15% off.  And so if you need a toaster, now this isn't like a crazy robot toaster.  It's not a sex toy.  I mean, I guess it could be, but you know, anything's a sex toy if you're daring enough.  But for all intents and purposes, it's just a toaster.  But if you're in the market for a toaster, this is a good toaster.  Actually, you know what?  Just so if you made it this far in the video and you haven't clicked off yet, here's a fun life hack using a toaster.  If you're really lazy and you want to make a grilled cheese sandwich, what you can do is you can lay the toaster on its side, put the cheese in between two slices of bread or put one slice of bread with a slice of cheese on top of it and put it in the toaster sideways and then toast the bread.  And what the toaster will do is it will melt the cheese to the bread, but because it's laying flat, the cheese won't drip into the tray.  So then when the toast comes out, the bread will shoot out and you'll have cheese, like melted cheese on your bread, and you won't have to use like a grill or anything like that.  So you can make a grilled cheese sandwich just using a toaster.  You can use butter or not butter if you want, but just lay the toaster on its side, Put the cheese on the bread, put the bread in the toaster, and make yourself a nice bachelor pad ghetto grilled cheese sandwich.  So there you go.  A little life hack, a little bonus thing you can do with a toaster in case you made it this far in the video.  Thank you, Kingstone, for the toaster.  It's a good toaster.  I recommend it.  I don't see any problems with it.  A lot of times some of these off-brand stuff, they cut corners.  I don't see any corners being cut.  You're effectively getting a $50 toaster for less money.  So there's no reason not to get this if you're in the market for a toaster.  So check out the coupon code.  Save an additional 15%.  It's the perfect thing.  If you need a toaster, here you go.  Thank you, Keenstone.  Thank you, everyone, for watching.
