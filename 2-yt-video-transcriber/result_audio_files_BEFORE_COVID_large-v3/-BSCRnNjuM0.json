Why are you crying, honey?  Oh, okay, no.  Are there cameras on you?  Keep crying.  Throw yourself on the floor.  Throw yourself on the floor right now.  Malala left me for a competitor and you haven't heard her fucking name in two years.  And you never will again.  David Hogg won't take a fucking meeting.  I've sent 30 pairs of sneakers to his dorm.  Jesus Christ!  Tell Malala she's gotta come out as non-binary if she wants heat now.  That's the way it is.  Nobody gives a shit about landmines anymore.  It's all climate.  Climate is sexy.  Climate and guns.  Clean water?  That hasn't been hot since the fucking late 90s.  Do people even fucking drink water?  Wake the fuck up.  I got the Covington kids and Nathan Phillips on a reconciliation tour opening for Lizzo.  Who is it, Emma Gonzalez?  Don't put her through.  She's fucked me for the last time.  I had her booked at Davos.  She got sick.  You get sick at Davos?  We got a new version of the Paul brothers from Syria.  They're fucking hilarious.  They do pranks.  One of them's missing an arm and they have fun with that.  It's great.  We got a kid with a cleft lip, but he's cute.  I want Hog at Madison Square Garden.  People are turning in their guns and crying to him.  They're handing their guns over to him and they're crying.  Yeah, this is just Jason.  I got a call for David.  Yeah, just let him know that I called.  We actually sent some stuff in the mail over if he could take a look at it.  Just a few sneakers and... Okay, sure.  Yeah.  We got a kid right now.  He has no limbs.  He is fucking hilarious, and he does a whole bit about the refugee crisis.  You have no idea how hard this kid is going to hit when he hits.  Do you understand?  No limbs.  We walk him out, we put him in a seat, and he just fucking goes, man.  He just goes.  These kids will own you one day.  I will make sure of it.  They will fucking own you.  I got a three-year-old from Iceland named Gunnar.  He loves economics.  He's talking about debt peonage.  I got him at the World Bank in three weeks.  Fuck you! ",
