            "text": "Fast and Furious case.  This week, the head of the House Oversight Committee plans to ask the FBI about discrepancies in the investigation into the murder of a federal agent.  Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was gunned down near the Mexican border last December.  At least two assault rifles from ATF's Fast and Furious case were found at the scene.  Fast and Furious allowed thousands of weapons to be sold to suspected traffickers from Mexican drug cartels.  As you know, My attorney general has made clear that he certainly would not have ordered gun running to be able to pass through into Mexico.  Back to follow up segment tonight, remember the Fast and Furious gun scandal?  That was a sting by the feds that allowed thousands of guns to be smuggled into Mexico from the USA so federal agents could track them, find out who was operating and selling guns south of the border.  One of those guns may have killed a border patrol officer, and another was found in El Chapo's arsenal when he was captured last week in Mexico.  In addition, federal judges told President Obama he cannot use executive privilege to withhold certain documents about the Fast and Furious case.  Yeah, so the Justice Department produced an index of the records that it was withholding after getting a subpoena from Congress.  It includes emails that detail how then Attorney General Eric Holder crafted the Fast and Furious talking points, 20 emails between Holder and his wife, emails and letters between Holder and the White House, and finally emails from and to the U.S.  Ambassador to Mexico, as well as about 16 other officials.  So yesterday this judge... said some of the records deserve executive privilege protection, others don't, giving the Justice Department two weeks to turn them over to Congress, which is still, Bill, trying to figure out basically this.  When and how much did the top people of the administration know about Fasting Furious, which they were blaming on a few rogue agents in Phoenix?  And, of course, we know that's not true.  Okay.  We'll say minutes ago.  Go ahead.  No, no, minutes ago, what happened?  Okay, so minutes ago I talked to the chairman of the oversight committee who told me that he and Senator Grassley are going to be writing a letter to ATF today demanding all the serial numbers of the weapons found with El Chapo.  He feels that basically they're going to seek a stay on this judge's ruling and hopefully run out the clock before the president leaves.  The Obama administration in general, and former Attorney General Eric Holder in particular, repeatedly lied to the family of a slain Border Patrol officer about the weapons used in his death and stonewalled efforts to get at the truth.  Correspondent William Lajnes tonight on Operation Fast and Furious.  when he arrived here in January 2017.  And his face, what he looked like, he was no longer in control.  He lost control.  He's outside of Mexico.  He's on U.S.  soil.  And to me, that feeling of defeat that we felt when he escaped, that's what he felt at that point.  A shocking allegation in the El Chapo trial.  The self-proclaimed right-hand man of Joaquin El Chapo Guzman is claiming government corruption went as high as the president of Mexico.  His name is Alex Cifuentes, and he was cross-examined on his third day of testimony.  And at one point, he claimed former Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto asked El Chapo for a $250 million bribe.  The president of the country.  Yes, yes.  So he claims El Chapo actually negotiated that down a little to $100 million.  But he's a businessman, and I'm sure a good negotiator.  Doing business.  So apparently that money was hand-delivered.  Allegedly that money was hand-delivered when Pena Nieto was about to take office.  who is the president-elect.  Cifuentes also told the court that El Chapo paid the Mexican military up to $12 million to kill members of rival cartels.  The former Mexican president has repeatedly rejected claims of corruption since the trial began.  Previous testimony accused several members on his team of being involved with the Sinaloa cartel.  Enrique Pena Nieto says that he has done nothing but actually bring crime down in Mexico.  We're gathered together this afternoon for a very historic occasion the signing ceremony for a brand-new trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement.  So important.  I'm honored to be here with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, become a great friend of Mexico, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has also become a great friend, which has been a battle And battles sometimes make great friendships, so it's really terrific.  And where does it get the prosecution to even bring this in, other than to humiliate the former president of Mexico, who at the time actually had a pretty sterling reputation?  Yeah.  It's not... It's, I think, improbable.  I think a fascinating question will be whether Nieto, the former president, comes to the United States, as he is perfectly capable of doing, and denies it during the defense case.  So, Mr.  President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, everybody.  We are not going to be taking any questions.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Here's a good rule.  Don't answer our questions when they just start yelling.  Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?  Mr.  President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance?  You are attacking our news organization.  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?  Here's a good rule.  Don't answer our questions when they just start yelling.  Sir, can you state, Mr.  President-elect, can you state categorically, Mr.  President-elect, can you give us a question?  You're attacking us.  Here's a good rule.  Don't answer questions when they just start yelling.  Can you give us a question?  Can you give us a question?  I'm not going to give you a question.  Can you state categorically?  You are fake news.  Sir.  Come on, guys.  Come on, guys.  Let's go.  Very good man.  Thank you, guys.  Appreciate it.  It's so nice to see you.  How are you?  I'm doing very well.  Thank you.  We're going to be a big one today.  So now we'll get used to the protocol.  You can go right here.  Hold on, sir.  This is painful, and it will be for a long time.  As you know, my Attorney General has made clear that he certainly would not have ordered gun running to be able to pass through into Mexico. ",
