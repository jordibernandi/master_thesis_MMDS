            "text": "Hello, hello!  In my previous video, I talked about how the hatred for laziness can be interwoven with ableism.  neglecting to consider accessibility needs, and often turning that hatred and anger into action that denies accessibility to those who need it.  If you haven't watched it yet, I hope you'll check it out because today I'm going to be reacting to comments beneath the ads for products that have been deemed lazy and unnecessary and sharing with you just how and who these products benefit as an accessibility tool.  Warning for ableism and fat antagonism ahead.  Bed desks.  Keep the bedroom for sleeping and sex.  The only activities going on in that sacred space should be positions, sleeping, etc.  Sad face.  Wow, this is absolutely terrible.  This thing is practically promoting people to never leave their rooms slash house.  Like, I have no idea why anyone would ever want this.  Honestly, this is something for people who weigh literally more than 800 pounds.  First off, this comment is a great example for how ableism and fat antagonism consistently weave into themselves.  Cut that out.  Some people cannot often leave their rooms slash house, and more specifically, their bed, due to chronic illness and other disabilities, including chronic fatigue, chronic pain, dysautonomia, and beyond.  Desks over one's bed make work accessible, crafts, dining.  I personally have a portable bed desk as well as one that rolls over my bed and I keep that one against the wall for days when I'm able to sit in my chair for longer than I need to be laying down.  Fold-a-mate.  It's too slow.  I'd be done with three loads of folding baskets by the time one is done with that machine.  She could have folded the next item in the amount of time it took your noisy machine to fold it.  If I have to stand there waiting for a machine to fold my laundry, I'd rather just do it myself for free.  Some people cannot fold their own laundry for free.  They have to pay for that.  Lots of things that abled people do for free disabled people have to pay extra for.  A walk around your block is free, right?  Not for me.  I had to save up and pay thousands of dollars for my wheelchair for the privilege of getting around my block.  And when you think about it, due to job inequality and sometimes inability to work, disabled people are among the most low-income communities to then have to pay extra for things that abled people can do for free.  Does that sound fair?  I don't think so, but that's the way it is.  Anyway, right, folding clothes may not be possible or it is extenuating for people with limited mobility, fragility of skin, joints, or muscles, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, etc.  Snuggie.  Tries to blanket properly accidentally detonate... Wait, hold on, I read that wrong.  Tries to detonate... Wait, what?  Tries to blanket properly.  Accidentally detonates thermonuclear weapon.  There has to be an easier way.  Tired of using blankets like this asshole?  Do they somehow destroy your heating bill?  Are mundane tasks like answering the phone now impossibly difficult?  The design of Snuggies enables people to take their apparel on and off without having to lift themselves from their seating position or reclining position.  So this goes for people who are ill in bed, people who are wheelchair users.  Also, they are just comfy.  Why are y'all no fun?  Sock slider.  People are lazy enough and now we are making them even more lazy.  Wow, must be so difficult to bend over and put your socks on.  Cry laughing emoji.  Not talking about the people who really need it.  We are really becoming so lazy that someone had to create a device to assist with socks?  I get that it may help someone who is either elderly or unable to bend over, but the people in the video are young.  Can I respond to the fact that A couple of these comments actually acknowledge that disabled people could use them, but then they follow that up with, all the people in the ad are young.  I'm a person who could use assistance with getting my socks on and off, both for grip reasons as well as back pain when bending over.  Also, bending over is a POTS trigger.  I'm young and disabled.  I could be in that commercial.  Disability doesn't have a look or an age.  Also, when it comes to marketing specific disability items like mobility aids or medical alert necklaces, et cetera, it is always elderly actors and that reinforces the misconception that young disabled people don't exist and discourages young disabled buyers by reinforcing the stigma.  So much so that responses like this happen.  Easy egg cracker.  That is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  Don't even bother trying to turn on the stove.  Really, people?  Just do the work or get out of the kitchen.  I am not that lazy.  This is so silly.  Cracking an egg is, well, like the most basic thing to do in a kitchen.  If you need a ridiculous gadget to do it for you, you should probably just go to Denny's for your breakfast.  With what money, Laura?  Some people can't crack eggs.  I don't know what to tell you.  You don't have to be a dick about it.  As I've mentioned before, mobility disabilities, coordination disabilities, and as of very recently, there was someone in my comments who said that this device would make cracking eggs accessible to them as someone who had difficulty with the texture due to a sensory processing disorder.  Metal straws.  Where are people going with their minds?  How about just drinking from the cup?  How about drinking out of a cup like a big boy or girl?  Why don't just straight, what?  Why don't just drink straight from the cup?  Why do you need a straw when I believe all Malaysians grew up drinking from the cup, glass, or even bottle?  That's a very peculiar boast.  And um, definitely not accurate as disabled Malaysians exist.  Ban all plastic items which are not biodegradable.  Every country should ban it.  This is an example where outrage succeeded in creating obstacles for disabled people and their needs.  In my previous video, I got to talk a little bit about how the outrage over pre-cut and pre-peeled fruits and vegetables got discontinued because of said outrage.  But don't worry about us.  We'll survive on the dollar menu.  Just kidding.  That's a weird joke.  We, some of us, cannot.  And also, why would you want that for us?  Disabilities that require straws for access to drinking and eating include Those with difficulty with grip, those with mobility disabilities, those with digestive disabilities, swallowing, disabilities where they must be horizontal, particularly while very much needing to stay hydrated, like with pots.  Bending straws that can reach them where they lay are necessary.  The original use for straws was for patients in hospitals, specifically plastic bendable straws.  The plastic could handle all temperatures.  It withstood chewing without harming the patients.  Patients who had spasms or seizures didn't risk being harmed by the material.  Those who were immunocompromised had a safe, sterile, one-time-use straw.  Although these were responses to metal straws, I do have to state that plastic alternatives, including metal straws, will simply not be an option for everyone.  And legal bans against plastic straws, among any other plastic medical tools, are dangerous for disabled people.  Straws definitely deserve a bigger spotlight, so that's actually going to be my next video, so subscribe and stay tuned for that.  Obviously I couldn't mention every single accessibility use for every single item, so leave me a comment and let me know what are some accessibility tools or aids that you can think of that people often neglect to consider.  And if you appreciate this video, you can definitely show your support by becoming a Patreon patron.  And be sure to check out last week's video.  And I will see you eventually. ",
