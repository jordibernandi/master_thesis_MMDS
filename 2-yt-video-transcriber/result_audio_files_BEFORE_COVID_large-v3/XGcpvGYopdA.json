The header by Omar Gonzalez is just off the mark.  This matchup would end in a tie, nil-nil.  Alright, moving on.  Many of you might not realize just one high school here along the border actually has an ice hockey team.  That would be the Coronado T-Birds.  The team suits up in New Mexico for the New Mexico Inter-Celastic Conference.  Hockey League with teams from Taos, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Los Alamos, and Rio Rancho.  And they are in first place with a 17-1 record.  Nearly all of the teenagers that take part in the sport are boys.  However, Coronado, one of the team leaders, is a female.  Coming up on ABC 7 at 10  p.m.,  Asher Wildman will introduce you to Kelsey Bird, a standout goalie making headlines with the big boys.  Literally. ",

And 52 was the high at South Loop.  They're currently at 47 degrees.  There is a look at that seven-day forecast, and you will notice the temperatures again will get warmer.  We're going to be climbing into the 60s and then some 70s as we take a look to early next week.  But again, overnight is going to be pretty cold.  A lot of us will be dropping down into the upper 20s. ",
