VivaFry, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber.  I do these things called vlogs, and for anybody who doesn't really get the pun, that is a law-based vlog, hence vlog.  When I first saw this in the news, I knew I had to do a vlog on it because it's got a bit of everything to it.  It's got a bit of law, it's got a bit of body language reading, it's got a bit of ethics and battle, and it's got a bit of basic common sense.  For those of you who don't know, CNN just held the seventh Democratic presidential debate.  It was hosted by Wolf Blitzer and Abby Phillip.  Now, full disclosure so you can assess the rest of this video accordingly, I did not watch the Democratic debate in its entirety.  I am still debated out from the 2016 presidential elections.  But I watched the highlights, I read reviews, so that at the very least I can still know what's going on.  And when I read about this particular exchange between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and when I went to watch the various video clips, it is an absolute work of vlog art.  Vlart?  No, that sounds a little gross.  It is a work of art.  So where do we start?  Well, let's just start by first watching the clip.  And for those of you who have been watching my MXR vlogs on copyright and fair use, bear this in mind.  I am using an insignificant portion of the overall democratic debate.  I am using the bare minimum to make the point for commentary that I want to make.  With that said, let's move on and see the clip in question. ",

There are going to be no questions of law, but there's going to be strategy of law.  Being the moderator of an adversarial debate is sort of like playing the role of a cross-examining attorney in a deposition.  Now, although there are obvious differences between the role of the moderator of a debate and a cross-examining attorney, I'm going to treat them the same for the purposes of these observations.  In previous vlogs where I've broken down or analyzed depositions, I've explained at length why, in theory, an attorney is not supposed to ask questions to which they do not know the answer.  An exception to that general rule is that an attorney can ask a question to which they do not know the answer.  if either answer the witness is going to be required to give is going to be equally damning.  So I'm not going to repeat what I said on that subject already.  What I am going to say for the purposes of this vlog, an attorney should not ask a question if they know what answer the witness is going to give and that answer is not going to help their case.  And that's exactly what Abby Phillip did just now.  Now you'll notice.  she asked her question as a leading question. ",

He explains the fundamental, call it absurdity or untenability of the question, in that even in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.

This also goes back to things I've said in previous vlogs where I've analyzed depositions.  The biggest mistake that the examining attorney can do, and it's something that young lawyers do quite often, is they don't actually listen to the answers to the question.  They have their list of questions, their anticipated answers to those questions, they ask the questions, get the answers, and they just move on to the next question.

It's a question that presupposes the very fact that was just denied in great detail by the previous question.  This is conduct that would simply be laughable if it came from an attorney, and the fact that it's coming from a CNN moderator in the context of a debate doesn't make it any less laughable.  I mean, the framing of the question is so absurd, it's almost as though Elizabeth Warren wrote the question for herself and gave it to the moderator to ask her in the debate.  But that could never happen.  Well, God, I suck at winking.  Now let's skip to the end of the debate because the fallout of this is even more amazing.  At the end of the debate, Elizabeth Warren refuses to shake Bernie Sanders' hand.

Tom Steyer is the guy in the middle, and apparently he heard everything.

            "text": "I think you just called me a liar on national TV.  First of all, can we fully appreciate how inappropriate a form it is to have this fight?  If it is a genuine response, it is absolutely not the proper form to have this argument.  But my assessment based on Elizabeth Warren's body language is that this is not a genuine response.  This response to a large degree looks to be calculated, premeditated, and you can tell in the way that Elizabeth Warren approaches Bernie Sanders.  Just look at the way her hands are clutched together, her shoulders are sort of slouched and bent over, like she's being crushed by the embarrassment of what she doesn't really feel comfortable doing.  My personal belief, and it might not be as insightful as I think it is, is that this was a staged response and Elizabeth Warren did it knowing full well.  the cameras and the mics would pick it up.  And let's look at the substance of Elizabeth Warren's outrage.  I think you called me a liar on national TV.  I think you just called Bernie Sanders a sexist misogynist on national TV.  This is a pure political ambush.  Either Bernie Sanders is forced to admit something that he denies in fact, or he's going to be faulted for calling Elizabeth Warren a liar on national television for having said that he said something he denies.  Elizabeth Warren, in no uncertain terms, just called Bernie Sanders a sexist and a misogynist on national TV during the presidential debates and fault him for calling her a liar for denying that he said what he says he didn't say.  And whether or not Elizabeth Warren's response was genuine or staged, one has to seriously question the judgment of anybody who would make such a scene under such circumstances.  This is on national TV.  It is neither the time nor the place to have this fight.  Elizabeth Warren's conduct here is no different than that family member who always makes a scene at Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.  Regardless of how enraged you are, it is not the time or the place to have this fight.  And refusing to shake someone's hand after a debate, I mean, they would have had to have done something pretty bad in order to warrant that type of snub.  It is no less shameful than an Olympic athlete refusing to shake the hand of his or her adversary.  And I've got to tell you, because it happened to me a lot in the practice of law, when an attorney refuses to shake my hand after an examination, I know that I won.  And I'm not exaggerating when I say this.  It happened to me multiple times.  If I were sensitive, it might have actually upset me.  It's part of the rules of engagement.  No matter how much you hate opposing counsel, you shake their hand after a confrontation.  To refuse to do so is a sign of weakness and immaturity.  So however much it pains your heart of hearts, put your hand out, shake their hand, smile, say thank you, and go on with your day.  And it's the same advice I give to my clients.  After the deposition, shake opposing counsel's hand.  If you don't do it, you are going to confirm that opposing counsel got to you and that they won that exchange.  And I've got to tell you, if Elizabeth Warren is angry with Bernie Sanders for implying that she's a liar on national television because he never actually called her a liar, if she happens to become the Democratic nominee, I can only imagine the mild rage that she's going to feel towards Donald Trump after their first debate.  I hope you enjoyed my breakdown, analysis, insights into this exchange because it is a thing of beauty.  And it is a thing of beauty from which we can all learn.
