She's like, don't touch my tail.  She's like, come here, I'll get you next.  What are you doing?  What is this box?  Pretty girl.  She's like, who's in there?  Is that it?  She's like, who is in this box?  Hello, pretty girl.  She's like, hello out there.  Who's there?  You two are really hysterical.  Round two, they're like, I think she's recording.  Excuse me.  No biting your sister's face.  She needs that face.  Your sister's falling asleep on your wrestling match here.  It's like, get over here.  Let's get a close-up.  I can't even... These two are really coming out of their shell and they've got quite the personalities, let me tell you.  Say hi.  Hi, ma'am.  Especially Cookie is very fascinated with the camera.  Oh my gosh.  This is what goes on at the sanctuary, people.  All the time.  This is their new bed.  They love this bed.  They have barely left it.  They love it so much.  I bought it for them yesterday.  Oh, I think she's got you pinned.  We might have to do a three count.  One, two, three.  She's like, not fair.  Now she's after your tail.  Oh, my gosh.  Cupcake, you are full of the dickens tonight, let me tell you.  What's happening?  She's like, who is in there?  I love her back.  You two are... Don't act like you're cleaning her.  I know now you're thinking about, yep, dealing with cupcake over this matter.  Who is in this box?  I want to know.  I want answers, Mom.  Okay, everyone.  Good night. ",
