He's just released a brand new album with the title, Jesus is King.  That's pretty overt.  Kanye has been doing these pop-up services around the country and thousands of people have been attending.  And he's saying he's a follower of Jesus Christ now.  I read in an interview, quote, he said, my job, this is Kanye speaking, is to spread the gospel and let people know what Jesus has done for me.  He says, I've spread a lot of things.  There was a time when I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me.  I was letting you know what the Hennessy had done for me.  I was letting you know all these things, but now I'm letting you know what Jesus has done for me.  And in that, I'm no longer a slave.  I'm a son now.  I'm a son of God.  I'm free, end quote.  That's nice.  Connie was being interviewed by Jimmy Kimmel And Jimmy said, so Kanye, do you consider yourself a Christian artist now?  Kanye said, hey, I'm just a Christian everything.  That's right.  That's right.  Now some would say, well, I don't know.  Is he really a Christian?  You know, just shut up for a minute, okay?  How about this?  Pray for him.  Pray that he gets grounded in his faith.  Pray that he's the seed sown on good ground that brings forth much fruit.  Listen, I applaud any person that makes any movement toward God.  And I want to encourage them in that, not critique them about that.  And I think it's fantastic because he's taking his considerable platform, and he has quite a platform, doesn't he?  To talk about faith.  It has people talking about Jesus.  I'm happy for that conversation.  People that wouldn't normally be talking about about the Lord we all have a pulpit to preach from no matter who we are no matter what we do. ",
