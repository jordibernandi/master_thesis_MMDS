            "text": "Hey Scaredy Cats, it's me, Scaredy Matt, and it's that time of decade again.  We're gonna talk about the 10 best horror movies of the decade, because the decade's over.  It's a list of my personal favorites, and that means I'm only going to be including movies that I've actually seen.  So shut your yaps.  If you think these movies stink, go suck an egg.  I like them.  Also, I'm arbitrarily limiting the movies on this list to one per director for some reason, just because I think it makes the movies on the list a bit more diverse and interesting.  This whole thing is arbitrary.  I'm not anybody.  Don't worry about it.  Getting started with probably the most controversial choice on this list.  When this movie came out, I feel like everybody disliked it, but I think maybe people should give it a second look.  I love the premise.  A pair of little girls being reintegrated into society after having been raised by a ghost.  Kinda hokey, maybe.  But Mama does a good enough job of making the situation believable, thanks in large part to some fantastic performances, creature effects, and grounding the situation in very relatable emotions.  This isn't a movie about a family being attacked by a ghost.  It's a movie about a complicated family dynamic and the effects that has on everyone involved.  It's just complicated people who love one another in ways that are sometimes very unhelpful.  And one of them is a ghost!  Ghost Stories is an anthology film about a skeptic named Philip who debunks claims of the paranormal, being tasked with investigating his mentor's final few unexplainable cases.  As his understanding of the universe begins to crumble before his very eyes, Philip is taken on a mind-bending odyssey that leads him into understanding uncomfortable truths about himself and his place in the world.  Definitely don't read anything about this movie.  Just watch it fresh.  Trust me on that one.  A family grieving from the loss of their son gets a visit from one of his army buddies, who sets about helping them solve a variety of problems in their lives.  But something about this man is not as it seems, and he is being pursued by a mysterious government agency.  This movie's charming.  There's no other word for it.  The performances are just wonderfully understated, the music is catchy, and the story manages to be tense, dark, and fun the whole way through.  It's the type of movie you can just watch over and over again, and you just Want to throw it on in the background sometimes just because it's so fucking watchable.  Dan Stevens is incredible as David in this movie.  He balances being menacing, charming, vulnerable, and vacant in a way that you just can't look away from.  When I heard they were remaking Suspiria, I let out an annoyed sigh so loud you could hear it from space.  Because why fucking bother?  Suspiria was already perfect, and also so of its time that any attempt to recreate it seemed doomed to fail.  Like, who are the people who want a remake of this movie?  Anybody who knows what it is doesn't want a remake of it.  Which is probably why this movie wisely chose to take the general premise, a few cheeky references and character names, and make an almost completely unrelated movie.  Where the original was a phantasmagorical psychedelic nightmare, this one is a subdued slow burn period drama.  The result is definitely not for everyone.  A lot of people are going to be put off by the film's two and a half hour runtime.  that is mostly just people being sad in Germany.  But if you're willing to be patient and let go of any preconceptions you might have had based on the original, you'll be rewarded with an intense, haunting, and inventive story.  And not one, not two, but three completely transformative performances by Tilda Swinton.  She's always good at movies, but she's like three times as good in this movie.  She's fucking next level.  It's crazy.  Now you're going to notice a theme in this list.  I love slow burn horror, and The Wailing might be the slowest burn imaginable.  It's the story of a Korean policeman investigating a string of inexplicable murders, which the locals blame on a Japanese foreigner.  It starts off as a comedy, and becomes a bleak, hopeless story of prejudice, inhumanity, and the fear of anything or anyone who is different.  The thing is, though, I'm not really sure where it makes the switch.  It just does, and you don't even notice it.  So one minute it's a broad, dopey joke about how the main character falls down a lot, and then you're confronted with the darkness in the heart of humanity, and you're just not ready for it.  Mandy is a movie made for me specifically, I'll let you watch it if you want, but it's not for you, it's for me and me alone.  A psychedelic dark fantasy about Nicolas Cage doing Nicolas Cage stuff because his girlfriend got murdered by a big ol' cult.  Mandy is the type of movie that you'll find yourself checking the runtime over and over on because you just, you don't want it to end.  Every second of it is a delight, and the longer it goes the more wonderful it becomes.  This movie finds a tone and commits to it in a way that few can manage.  Logic, good taste, and coherence be damned.  Is Nicolas Cage gonna fight demons with a handcrafted battleaxe?  Sure!  Is there a mind-reading drug dealer who has an emotional relationship with a caged tiger?  Yeah, okay!  Does Nicolas Cage ascend to his personal Valhalla that looks like a heavy metal album cover at the end?  I won't spoil it.  You'll have to see the movie to find out.  And then there's The Cheddar Goblin.  If any character ever deserved a spin-off, it's The Cheddar Goblin.  But the film wisely only teases us with glimpses of him, leaving the rest to our imagination.  It Follows is about a sexually transmitted ghost.  It's also one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  A relentless, pulse-pounding horror movie married to a somber reflection on the transition from child to adult, and the loss of innocence that must come along the way with that.  The whole movie is so wonderfully off-kilter, from the weird stilted dialogue, to the anachronistic fashion and technology, to the bizarre and incredibly specific premise.  Everything about it follows leaves you bewildered and constantly questioning what exactly you're seeing.  And the soundtrack is a work of genius.  including a stinger that rivals the psycho Jaws or Halloween themes for setting the mood.  Do I gotta tell you Get Out is good?  Do you need me to explain?  it's one of the best horror movies of the decade?  Get Out is a masterclass in socially conscious storytelling.  It manages to get its point across elegantly and powerfully, while somehow also manages to be fun and crowd pleasing.  This movie turns on a dime from being scary to funny to triumphant to poignant, all without ever sacrificing an iota of cohesion.  Get Out is one of those movies that other movies are going to be compared to for years.  It's the new benchmark for political horror, and it's going to cast a long shadow over the genre.  Personally, I think we've only started to see the impact of Get Out, and I'm also excited to see the films it inspires and to see more from Jordan Peele.  Hereditary, oof.  When I go to a movie, I like to do the whole thing.  I like to get myself a big old popcorn and just go nuts on it.  Just go ham on that popcorn of mine.  And there's a moment in Hereditary where I put down that popcorn and never thought about it again.  If you've seen the movie, you know exactly what that moment is.  This movie is a shock to the system.  This isn't horror in the same way that, say, Hellraiser is horror.  This isn't horror that's fun to look at.  This isn't escapist.  This is horror in the truest sense of the word.  It's difficult to see.  It makes you uncomfortable.  Hereditary is challenging.  There is nothing in this movie that lessens the impact of the events happening on screen.  There are supernatural elements, but the real horror comes from grief, mental illness, and abuse.  You can't dismiss that like you can dismiss a ghost or a demon.  The horror is real, and Hereditary makes sure you confront it.  Almost no movie scares me anymore, but Hereditary made me want to crawl into bed and hide from the world.  Clear your day if you're going to watch this one.  Before we get to number one, let's talk about some honorable mentions.  Tucker and Dale vs.  Evil, that movie's hilarious.  The Babadook, arguably, that's where elevated horror started.  Hush?  That movie is just good.  What We Do in the Shadows?  Absolutely hilarious and just genuinely inventive.  How come they don't make movies about actual vampires anymore?  Midsommar is great.  I definitely would have made the list, except Ari Aster had already had Hereditary on the list.  And also You're Next.  would have made the list, but the guest was already on the list.  The Lighthouse would have made the list as well, but, well, you'll see.  Under the Shadow is great.  It's a movie about a woman in the... Iran War being haunted by a djinn.  It Comes at Night is very tense and incredibly bleak and it just it makes you feel like shit to watch.  The Perfection is the type of movie I only ever want to watch once but that one watch I did was fantastic.  Any movie was gonna have a hard time following Get Out but if one movie was gonna do it I think Us came pretty fucking close to being almost as good as Get Out.  Surprising no one, The Vevitch, and that's how it's pronounced.  Stop trying to correct me in the comments.  Look at the poster.  It says, The Vevitch.  What else could that possibly mean?  It's my pick for the horror movie of this dang old decade of ours.  The Vevitch is a meticulously researched period piece filmed entirely with natural light and performed in a period-accurate dialect.  It very slowly tells the story of a family being gradually dismantled by either a witch or their own emotional problems, depending on how literal you want to be.  Mostly, it's a movie about a family argument 200 years ago.  Also, somehow, it's one of the most gripping movies I've ever seen.  It just grabs your attention and does not let go.  Robert Eggers makes filmmaking look easy, like he just walked across a family out in the woods and let the camera roll.  You wouldn't expect the story of a girl in 18th century New England dealing with an unseen evil in the woods would make you go, yeah, I know how that feels so many times.  I rewatched The Vivitch recently and it turns out I need not have bothered because every second of it was burned into my mind.  The Vivitch, if you haven't, there's two cat paws up.  What?  which is how we've rated movies since the beginning of this channel.  Look, I know it's fashionable to be critical about the state of the film industry, and largely I agree, but this has been an incredible decade for horror.  It's easy to look at all the mass-market PG-13 cookie-cutter garbage and conclude that they just don't make them like they used to.  But I think we're going to look back on the 2010s, a largely shitty decade, and finally remember how exciting it was for so many amazing horror movies to be released one after another.  I don't know how long this is going to last, but I'm so grateful that it's here and now.  From everyone here, it's Scaredy Cats LLC.  I hope you have an amazing new year and an amazing new decade.  Cheddar Goblin 2020, I love you.  Like and subscribe. ",
