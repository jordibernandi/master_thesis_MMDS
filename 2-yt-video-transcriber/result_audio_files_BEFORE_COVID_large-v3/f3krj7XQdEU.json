            "text": "If you had a religious or specifically Christian upbringing, you may have heard many, many stories that you believed were literally true, sourced from the Bible.  So today, I present to you five biblical stories that you may have believed were true, and they just didn't happen.  Once again, I am Mr.  Atheist.  Let's do this.  For nearly daily atheist content, hit that subscribe button, click the bell, and turn on notifications.  Let's get started.  Number five, Noah's flood.  Now, this one is complicated because a lot of different people have different versions of this story.  In modern day Christianity, via apologetics, have sort of changed the narrative with many people believing there was some local flood.  But growing up, I was taught that there was a literal global flood that covered every inch of the earth, and that this served as something of a baptism for the earth.  And I got this education not just from church, but actually the school I attended too.  We sang songs about Noah and the flood, and bringing in the animals two by two.  And that little detail is one of the good reasons we know this didn't actually happen.  The Bible details the dimensions of the ark, and no ark of that size would possibly be able to carry two of every animal, or more specifically, seven of every clean animal and two of every unclean animal.  Besides that, through modern genetics, DNA, and all of the things we have learned about the development of animal life, we also know that all animals aren't related to a simple set of parents from only 4,000 years ago.  Additionally, an ark of that size would have no chance of being seaworthy.  And modern anthropologists and archaeologists have records of plenty of peoples that were alive at that time that were just straight up not wiped off of the earth.  Additionally, it would be impossible for such a worldwide flood to happen without leaving some incredible geological data.  And perhaps the most damning evidence are actual trees that are older than the flood, which ignores another detail that all plant life would have been eradicated at that time.  Number four, the pyramids were not built by Jewish slaves.  Now this is actually something that is more recently popularized as an idea.  It's only a few decades old, but a lot of people seem to believe that Jewish slaves built the pyramids, and that those are the great buildings we read about being built in the Old Testament.  That didn't happen either.  The fact is there were no Jews, Israelites, or Hebrews until some centuries after the pyramids were built.  We know who built the pyramids, having discovered the tombs of the builders not long ago.  And yes, it was aliens.  No, I'm kidding.  That's not true either.  I'm not saying it was aliens because it wasn't.  What the motivations for popularizing this as the narrative, it's hard to say, but this is actually kind of a racist take on things.  Tried to depict ancient Egyptians as these sort of cruel slave masters who were bloodthirsty and evil.  So that's number four.  The Jews didn't build the pyramids.  Those aren't the buildings that are being talked about in the Old Testament.  Which brings us to number three, the story of the Jewish slaves and Moses and them building these great buildings in Egypt.  Yeah, it also didn't happen.  Not just the pyramids.  They didn't really build any of those Egyptian structures.  In fact, there is zero evidence where there should be quite a bit of anthropological or genetic evidence or whatever that there were ever Egyptian slaves in Egypt at all.  But the Exodus story is that three million Jews flee Egypt under the leadership of Moses to Mount Sinai, and they spend some 40 years trying to get to Mount Nebo.  Or Mount Nebo, whatever you prefer, or whichever one's correct.  The distance between these two locations is about 492 kilometers, or 306 miles.  To put that in perspective, if you knew where you were going, it would take you roughly 100 hours to walk there.  If you averaged five miles a day, you'd be there in 20 days.  But these 3 million people in this desert apparently lived for 40 years without finding this other location.  This is a very suspicious detail because there are civilizations from surrounding areas that were much smaller, numbering in the thousands sometimes, that we have lots of proof existed.  and yet these 3 million people in this rather small desert existing for 40 years left no trace of themselves.  literally nothing.  And not to belabor the point, but keep in mind again, it supposedly took them 40 years to do a trip that, were we to do it today, could be done in a car completely in daylight.  As in, you could do it in between the time the sun came up and sun went down.  And there still exists no trace of an Egyptian record of anything of this kind, these massive numbers of people existing and being in servitude to the Egyptians or their exodus.  But now we move on to number two, one of the first stories as a young child you are likely to hear.  And that is the story of Adam and Eve.  So we start with this point here, and this is going to ruffle some feathers, but evolution is a fact.  By many, the theory of evolution is revered as the single most well-supported theory in all of science.  The amount of evidence for it is tremendous, and inasmuch as we apparently all exist, we apparently all exist as a result of evolution.  This, much like Noah's flood, eliminates the possibility that all of humankind come from just a single pair of individuals.  This not to be mixed up with a concept.  in biology we call mitochondrial eve, and there are many mitochondrial eves throughout history.  A mitochondrial eve would be a single female human that all humans actually share some DNA with.  But this doesn't point to an original source or an original Adam and Eve.  In fact, there are likely several mitochondrial eves alive today that thousands of years from now, those people will have common DNA, all of them, with some mitochondrial eve that is around now.  And while that is a super fascinating biological fact, this is something that goes beyond our species.  We have many mitochondrial eves in species that preceded our own.  With evolution, there is also not a single moment where one species becomes another.  All animal species have parents without question, and those parents are always the same species as the child.  Species change happens more as a gradient, not a single line or barrier to hop over.  This may point to why there is a significant amount of religious hostility toward the theory of evolution, because it does debunk, in fact, the Adam and Eve story as really impossible.  Finally, number one, and the one that will be the most controversial and I'm sure met with the most comments that don't agree, the number one biblical event that didn't happen, the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Now believe it or not, this is not a video advocating for the mythicist position, that idea that no Jesus ever existed.  However, if that Jesus did exist, certainly the miracles, and specifically the resurrection with which he is credited, did not appear to actually happen.  There are, first of all, no first-hand accounts of the resurrection of Jesus.  Literally no one who supposedly witnessed wrote it down themselves.  The original witness stories were penned nearly a century after the alleged event.  This is a separation of multiple generations at that point.  And beyond that, there are other events that allegedly occurred at the exact same time as the resurrection of Jesus, one of which being that many people also were risen from the dead and went into Jerusalem and were met by their family and their friends, and not one of these individuals wrote about it or spoke about it.  At the end of the day, the reason why we know this didn't actually happen is such a tremendous and incredible event was written by no one who firsthand experienced it.  And this wasn't a time that record keeping was rare.  You would expect to see not just Jewish, but also Roman records reflecting things that are happening at this time.  And while I'm sure there are many who are going to say, you weren't physically there, so you can't be sure that that didn't absolutely happen, this is a very poor line of reasoning.  You can apply it to absolutely anything.  We as humans very reasonably dismiss things as happening if they are tremendous claims without evidence that it suits the details of those claims.  And perhaps if you are upset with that line of reasoning, my guess is you are a Christian watching this, and consider that you have no problem completely dismissing the idea that Muhammad left this earth on a flying horse and tore the moon in twain.  We also, most of us, very reasonably dismiss the idea that aliens helped build the pyramids, even though we aren't entirely sure all of the details of how the pyramids were built.  The simple existence of that gap does not mean you can insert into it anything you wish.  Hmm, phrasing.  We dismiss many things, such as the miracles of other gods and fairies, that are things that are recorded as history by civilizations that believed in them, simply on the basis that those tremendous claims need to actually be demonstrated.  And similarly, we can dismiss the claim that Jesus was resurrected.  You see, that would be an incredible unnatural or supernatural event, whichever you wish, and therefore it would be very reasonable, dare I say logical, to dismiss that claim until it has been demonstrated that there is a good reason to believe in it besides the accounts of people that came a century after the alleged event.  So there you have it.  Those are five major biblical events that many of us were taught were true, were absolute fact and literal history of our world.  But at the end of the day, they just didn't happen.  If you would like to see more nearly daily atheist content, do be sure to hit that subscribe button.
