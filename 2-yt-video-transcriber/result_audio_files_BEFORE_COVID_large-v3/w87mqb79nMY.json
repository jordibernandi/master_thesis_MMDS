            "text": "Hey it's Tyisha on the new Tymonix channel where I bring you firearms and different vlogs on Sundays for Sunday Gun Day.  Today I'm going to show you how I will take my subcompact Glock 27 and turn it into a full size handgun using the X grip.  So here I have my Glock 27.  I just showed you that I have a X grip as well as a 22-23 Glock magazine that holds 15 rounds.  No tools are needed for this conversion.  Just take that 15 round magazine.  And I just have my 9 round and my 10 round magazine for size comparison.  Do not just take a 15 round mag and put in your Glock.  that looks... crappy, it looks like, you know, trash.  What you're gonna do is use this X-grip here and I will leave a link for that in the description.  And as you see, this is for Glock 26 and 27.  Now, I normally wouldn't have my firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, pointing towards me.  However, I do not want my serial number on these internet streets, so that's why I have my firearm turned towards me for a second.  And I recommend buying an X-grip for every 15 round mag that you get.  I only have one, so I have one X-grip.  No tools are needed.  Simply take the X-grip out of the package and put it on the magazine as shown in the picture.  Simple as that.  And then you are ready to go to turn your subcompact into a full-size handgun. ",

            "text": "I just showed you how I took the magazine for the Glock 22, 23, used the X grip to make it turn my subcompact Glock 27 into a full size.  Thus, this will make it easier for me to shoot.  I have long hands.  Yeah, long hands.  So I'll show you the difference with my grip.  So once again, I'll show you that I have a clear weapon.  I have no ammunition on board, anything like that.  But yeah, I want to show you the difference in my grip with the three different magazine types.  Okay, this one here is the nine round 27 magazine.  And once I insert that.  I have no, like this finger just floats.  And that messes up my grip whenever I'm shooting.  As you know with the Glock 40, it has a big bang.  So I find that I do not have enough control to, after I fire, to keep control and stay on target and recover.  So, I hardly ever use this round, I mean this magazine.  So then I went ahead and got the one round extension making the nine round magazine a 10 round.  I like this for a while, however, it pinches right here.  Whenever you fire it, you will, this finger will have a blood clot there, it will get pinched.  it does give you that extra space.  i was at the point where i was considering selling my 40 and just getting a 22 or 23 when someone says no you don't have to do that.  just uh purchase the x grip and use the 22 23 max on your 27. so Here it is.  I showed you that.  So I have a lot of extra room.  As you see here, I have a lot of extra space so I can position my pinky finger lower because of course with the 10 round, I'm not sure if that'll pinch me or not.  that right there, if that will pinch me or not, but I have plenty of hand space, plenty of space to establish my grip in there, get on target, recover, and come back in.  I like it.  so far, I love it.  So I haven't taken this to the range, I just opened everything up, I will.  Stay tuned for another Sunday gun day vlog, and we'll go to the range, and you'll see me put this baby in action, but I think I just fell in love with my Glock 27 all over again.  So let me know if you've done this type of conversion with your subcompact Glock.  And yeah, let me know how that worked out for you.  But so far, I've fallen in love back with my Glock.  How I'll probably carry this for concealed carry, I'll still carry the 10 round mag in, but I'll probably carry the 15 round mag in the holster.  Go ahead and also subscribe to this channel.  Also check me out on social media.  I've been checking out and wearing My new in the waistband holster by Tactics Hub.  Use it with my Glock and I absolutely love it.  So I'm going to continue wearing it, reviewing it, and just really wearing out this holster so I can let you know how it is.  But automatically, I've been wearing this for a week.  It's a great buy.  So I'm going to leave the link for this holsters in the waistband holster for the Glock 15 round magazine, as well as the X grip.  I'll leave that in the comments.  And we highly, highly, highly, highly recommend the belly band holster by Tactics Hub as well.  So I'll leave that in the comments and I'll leave you a link to that post I shared on Instagram.  Shout out again to everyone who helped me with this knowledge to not sell my Glock, but to fall in love with it again.  And also to my friends at Tactics Hub.  Thank you for putting out a great product.  Like I said, someone recommended that I get a belly band holster.  This was the best price I found online.  Invested in it, loved it.  Still getting more great products.  I'll see you on the next video. ",
