That's a good walk.  That's a monster that's coming out of an international flight to LAX.  Okay, we hit the second one.  You're not going very far.  Huh?  What happened?  Oh, no, I'm not doing anything negative.  I've recorded the cops here for the last 20 years, Marshall, FBI.  I'm just... Oh, no, you guys are fine, man.  Okay, thanks, guys.  Be safe.  All right, folks.  I don't try to get into any altercations with the U.S.  Marshals.  Oh, thank you, man.  All right, folks.  LAX.  They'll be nice marshals with no anger.  Talk to you guys later. ",
