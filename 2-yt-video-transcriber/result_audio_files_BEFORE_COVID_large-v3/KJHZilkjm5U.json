            "text": "One thing I've been thinking about lately, and maybe it's something to consider, maybe it might help you in a certain way, regardless of what kind of particular person you are, is just the base blanket approach of considering yourself a good man.  And not in relation to women, especially.  Not in relation to the servile characteristics which they would expect of you to be validated as a good man.  No, just an intrinsic self-worth.  Men have been convinced that psychologically, they shouldn't fight for anything other than what the female wants, and by extension society will be some sort of utopia, everything will be good.  But to that extent, men would rather fight for something more than just a paycheck.  Men can't just fight for a paycheck and then bring it back to someone that's angry at them because women make 75 cents in the dollar.  So what's a man supposed to fight for today?  And by fight I mean stand up for.  And I would offer, stand up for yourself.  Up here, especially.  In public, when you have conversations with groups of people, and you post to them, you know, what do you think a good man is?  Many will say, takes responsibility, doesn't hit women, he's a good father, he's a good provider, doesn't lie or cheat on his woman, etc.  But all these values are for others.  They're all sacrificial.  They're all servile.  And the reward for feeling good as a man is this validating pat on the head.  Now, I'm not saying a human connection.  in terms of some sort of validation, is necessarily unhealthy.  What I am saying, particularly today, with the hostile attitude towards men, is that men need to hack that hard wiring where they feel pride in themselves only when they're seen as good men in relation to women, especially if women increasingly don't care.  And this is nothing against women, This is a video for men and their mental perception and health of themselves.  But curiously, if you direct a woman today to be a real woman or a good woman in the service of others, you'll get an insulted look directed back at you.  So what I'm saying is that men are harming themselves psychologically more and more because they can't dislodge from this feeling of servile validation of being a good man.  your traditional strength as a man your masculinity is not needed by a gynocentric society but i would contend it's needed by you conceptually and metaphysically for your own mental health gentlemen to connect with the world around you and people in a meaningful way to finally pull back from this servile attitude and have some self-respect as an autonomous individual human being that happens to be a man with everything that being a man and being masculine embodies.  It's not a cartoonish mask that today's society and women would have you believe, that the term masculine is synonymous with a boy playing dress-ups in a superhero costume, that it's somehow clownish to respect yourself as a man, as someone who's masculine and adopts those values.  Today's system would have men cross-dress.  with women's values of what a real man should be and feel good about themselves.  But we can't.  Gentlemen, manliness and your self-respect as a man is not just being a nice person that makes women smile.  Being a wise and good and solid guy is not just behavior that keeps a woman smiling.  If there's one concept I'd like men to sort of get from this video is the concept that They're fine as men.  They're not broken women.  And in an auto-talic way, have some self-respect, not in relation to women or society.  But since everything else in modernity has become independent, think of that as a concept, except men, they still have this reflex.  That's a good reflex, to be of service and to be kind to others.  But it's not reciprocated.  Men are mentally suffering, not being able to sort of reprogram their perception of themselves.  To me, there's a big distinction between being a good or better man as opposed to being a good or better person.  But the system would have us all competing equally with a mental conception of ourselves as genderless, no differentiation, without meritocracy, Without acknowledging our objective strengths, and as such, as a strong and caring guy, you start caring for those that are weaker than you, that need your help.  Because I get a sense of, if you're not proud of your strengths as a man, and I don't just mean physically, then you start to lose wanting to help those because you might be in a better position than they are.  You start losing kindness and caring for those that are weaker than you.  There are repercussions for women losing their femininity.  and cross-dressing as men, figuratively speaking, and men doing the same.  We care for each other less because there's no distinction that we would care in a differentiated way towards the other.  If we're all told we're the same, why should I help another person where I might have skills and abilities that could help them?  We're all the same.  They can take care of themselves.  We should all fend for ourselves.  But no, they want us competing materialistically for survival on some sort of vanilla, bland playing field.  Let's be neurotic, lost, rudderless, depressed people that keep looking to higher powers to save us because we're not relying on each other.  You know, ooh, how convenient.  Both sexes hamstring themselves to operate at the lowest level of this genderless, sexless version of ourselves.  And then wonder why we're not attracted to each other.  Go figure, huh?  And I'm not saying to put on a mask.  Don't be the tough guy.  Don't be the macho guy, the unfeeling guy, the desensitized man that cuts off his feeling.  No, I'm saying the opposite.  Be sensitive in relation to yourself.  And I know it's a very hard thing to conceptualize, but for our mental sake in a survival sense today, I think it's essential that we need to reconceptualize how we integrate into the world today.  Just because you cared once and it felt good as a man to care in whatever way you cared.  You know, you felt that pleasure, you felt love.  And if that left, you don't want to feel that pain.  And so you'll desensitize yourself.  So you'll never feel that negativity again.  Look, if you want to live, there's got to be death too.  Don't shut the door on feeling alive, gentlemen.  And don't shut the door on the confident masculine parts of you that can help you feel alive.  People today are quite quick to know themselves cataphatically.  They know what they don't like, and then they're angry at the world.  They go, I know myself in relation to what I hate.  I hate this.  I hate men.  I hate women.  I hate the system.  I hate this.  But there's none of this going.  You're not going towards anything.  You're not being for anything.  You're not loving anything.  You're not passionate about your hobbies.  You don't know what to do next without something to hate or without something to serve, particularly as a man.  And I think that's a dangerous psychological place for men to inhabit today.  I know the system's against us, but guys, I would offer that we need to have more self-respect.  Again, our reflex is what respect?  Why should I respect... Not them, not the system, not outside yourself.  Respect yourself autotallically, in and of yourself.  You know, not solipsistically, but you're an active conscious member of enjoying your life out there and relating to it and putting yourself first.  Again, I know the hard wiring is hard.  It's easy to go, fuck you, you don't respect me.  But again, that's requiring the external to relate to you first before you give yourself permission to be happy.  And this isn't about any woo-woo, solipsistic, modern, holistic sort of Spiritual memes where you just believe and you put post-it notes around your house to remind you how great you are, how wonderful a snowflake you are.  None of this.  I'm talking about a male stoicism, a masculine strength of reason and belief in the important things in life where you're at the central focus of it.  A whole man that respects himself first.  Not that gets angry at the world and the injustices.  Life is as it is.  But the real injustice is to turn the lights off on yourself.  Most guys today, over generations, the PR, the marketing, I can understand it's all against us.  But slowly, I think unconsciously, it's seeped in.  Most men don't respect themselves as men.  So the consensus is masculinity, maleness, that's antiquated.  We're just supposed to be neutral, good people.  Although conveniently, we still give awards to women in air quotes.  I've said it before.  Men are dying.  Masculinity is dying.  We've been conditioned to be anti-masculine from a conceptual point of view.  And it is killing us, gentlemen, the neurotic and psychological depression of men not knowing what to do, how to fit in and how to operate in the world mentally, let alone physically, with the roles abandoned.  And we're all supposed to compete with each other just for taxes, money and all that sort of superficial shit.  You know, male strength used to represent a stoic posture, which I fully advocate, but now it represents a sensitive one.  We're losing something very important.  Notice even the language out there has been diluted and lowered to such a degree that it applies to both men and women of how we could relate, not just towards each other, but there were some words in our language that related just to men, and we could conceptualize and process how we fit in, how we related to other men, how we work together with other men to operate in the world.  Now it's kind of been lowered and neutralized.  Largely, they've either banned words or made them female-friendly, So everything is homogenized, you know, one sex, conceptually speaking, with no thought as to what is being lost conceptually from a male and masculine point of view.  Women's femininity loses out too, but I'm talking about men here.  Because the world still gives women a soft landing despite getting rid of femininity.  But the erasure of masculinity, of being proud to be a man, the consequences of erasing that, no one cares about.  And I understand biologically why.  You know, the men aren't the limiting factor in reproduction and everything today is geared towards the female.  I understand, objectively.  Look, I don't expect women to care for men collectively.  They're not wired that way.  But even if some of you say that there's no brotherhood and men don't care for each other as well, we're disposable.  Women see men as disposable and likewise, men see themselves as disposable.  I would say in today's environment, in today's culture, We need to hack that way of thinking for our own mental health and survival or things will just keep getting worse because the culture is just increasing the volume on anti-male sentiments.  It's not just that.  you're okay as a guy.  Be proud of being a man.  And don't let go of these stoic concepts that once imbued what it meant to be a strong man, not just physically, mentally too, gentlemen.  You're not just strong physically and mentally to serve others.  It needs to be for yourself first and foremost.  even if afterwards the next step is to contribute from that position of strength.  You know the saying, when the plane's going down, you give yourself oxygen first before you can help others.  Anyway, have a think about some of that, gentlemen.  I hope that helped.  Talk to you later. ",
