When I started in radio, I started in rock radio.  Because I love the music.  I grew up knowing a lot of the artists.  So it was a natural fit.  People didn't see me because I could talk about something they cared about.  So I could sit down with a long hair, earring, tattooed guy at a Poison concert in 1987 with Lita Ford and Whitesnake, you know, or Joe Cocker, Stevie Ray Vaughan.  And we could talk about things and... Amazingly, nobody kind of went to color because once you remove the veil by how you act, people may have a moment, but they tend to come over to your side.  And when I went to entertainment talk and when I did a show with Willie D from the Ghetto Boys, All right, conservative David Webb, Willie D, ghetto boy's gangster rap out of the Fifth Ward in Houston.  And we don't agree on politics, but we agreed on something, which was we were trying to save people in the black community.  And Willie, I got to tell you, was one hell of a good guy on that.  And that's what we did.  We focused on what we could do together.  So I didn't see the, are there racists in the world?  Yeah.  Did somebody have a bias against me?  You know what?  I don't care because I'm not going to let it stop me.  If I can't go through you, I'm going to go around you.  And that's my approach to it.  And that's how my parents raised me.  They said, find a path, work your way through it, and just do what you can to the best of your ability.  And if you have to readjust, hey, that's life. ",
