We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right.  And that's why it's more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their CHICOM masters by word of mouth and spread the word about InfoWars and check out InfoWarsStore.com.  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded.  That's where the tip of the spear is continually being forged is InfoWarsStore.com. ",
