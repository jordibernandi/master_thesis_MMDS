There is an establishment.  The establishment is just this harsh reality every candidate with good ideas has to deal with.  And even Andrew Yang on the H3 podcast said this town has a tendency to just... to just chew up idealists and spit them out.  Well, sometimes that's the establishment's fault, but other times it's the candidate's fault because sometimes candidates can't learn to play a new game.  And that doesn't mean the game's always bad.  It means that you have to be adaptable.  And to a certain extent, I guess fitting into the establishment is a certain test.  Of metal, because whether you like it or not, if you do become president, you're going to have to deal with a much larger establishment now than just your own party politics.  I mean, you're dealing with an establishment of what U.S.-Russia relations are, U.S.-Colombia-Venezuela relations are, U.S.  and Japan and China and Hong Kong and Taiwan relations are.  So... I think it's very interesting that Andrew Yang said he felt something.  He says he thought he moved the needle.  And it brings to mind several breakthrough speeches that certain presidential candidates have had in the past.  I'm thinking of JFK in Houston at the Rice Awards.  Hotel where he was speaking with a lot of Protestant ministers that were concerned about influence from the Pope coming through a Catholic running for president.  I think of Ronald Reagan in his first speech at the RNC Where he infamously said that the closest thing to eternal life that we have found is a government bureaucracy and he made the limited government argument that launched him into stardom in the RNC.  and then also Barack Obama.  I mean, Barack Obama, when he gave that first that first address from the Senate, having been, I think, only like the second or third African-American to have won a Senate seat.  I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was.  it was a pretty significant milestone that a lot of people weren't completely highlighting yet.  And then he has his breakthrough performance at the DNC.  These things do matter.  And the fact that we don't know exactly what Tom Perez is saying because we didn't have him hot mic'd up like Obama was hot mic'd up when he said that he would be able to help out Putin more in his second term of presidency.  We didn't have him hot mic'd up.  But the the body language.  Is is obviously positive and the body language is obviously affirmative in in a way that seems like he's been positively impressed.  And if there's anybody you need to positively impress, if you're going to make it through as a Democrat, it's Tom Perez, the director of the DNC or the chairman.  I'm sorry.  Of the DNC.

They don't want him.  I almost wonder if it's just a little bit like, who's this guy?  He's never held office.  Why should we care?  Why should we waste any time on him?  So I think him just getting in front of the DNC and having a chance to just kind of show what he's about.  We saw that maybe some of them were in their heads like, this Yang guy, what is he talking about?  And then he goes up there and they're like... Oh, you know what?  That's a platform, man.  We could run a campaign around.  We could win a campaign on this.  And this is how you do it.  You just stay in it.  I'm going to actually flash over.  I don't have all of the segments picked out.

            "text": "It depends on how far the reach of the marketing arm of the DNC proper actually is.  I'm thinking of Ronald Reagan's speech at the RNC.  Back when that happened, that was before the famous William F. Buckley interview when pundits came out and people would actually watch the actual content of the DNC and the RNC a lot more.  Obviously, the same thing with JFK.  People would actually watch the content of the DNC and the RNC.  Now we actually watch the interpretation of the talking heads of the content and the highlight reels of the content.  So it would depend on whether or not he made it into the highlight reels that made it into the mainstream media.  And and and obviously he's got Tom Perez's buy in, it seems.  But we don't know whether he's got the buy-in of the media.  And honestly, if you don't have the buy-in of the media, or should I say the propaganda arm of the DNC, if you don't have the buy-in of the propaganda minister, then you're still not going to be getting all of the pub.  So this is a good thing.  And I said he moved the needle.  He didn't say he spiked the needle, but I do believe... that that would be a moving of the needle in the proper direction towards securing him further success in the DNC party nomination process.
