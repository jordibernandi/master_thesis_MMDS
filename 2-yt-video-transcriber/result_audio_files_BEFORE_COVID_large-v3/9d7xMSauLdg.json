But you got to understand that it is almost impossible to be unhappy in life if you're financially successful, if you got your money sorted, you don't have debt, attractive women like you and want to spend time with you.  I'm not saying that that needs to be the priority.  You should be the priority.  Putting your dent in the universe should be the priority.  But I hear an awful lot of guys these days pointing and sputtering at me or other people out there that claim to be, you know, red-pilled or whatever when they're not.  They're just little babies.  They manufacture indignation.  Let me give you a really good example.  You know, I've said things in the past like I think that... Tatted up women is literally the equivalent of putting bumper stickers all over a Ferrari.  So what happens?  Some tatted up woman hears it.  She sends that lyric or the sound bite to her friend that has a YouTube channel.  And a fat purple haired feminist with sleeve tats and hand tats and neck tats does a video about how I'm such a bad guy.  And it's like their response video.  How is that any different from the quote-unquote red pill guy that points and smutters at me when I'm telling guys to do the work and take ownership for their indiscretions, right?  There's a lot of things in life that I could have just given up on.  There's a lot of times in life, I'll tell you this, that I could have just given up.  So many times.  But I persevered.  I pushed through.  I mean, the difference between, you know, winning and losing.  What's that lyric?  Triumph?  You know, the difference between triumph and oomph is the oomph, basically.  Doing the work.  Not getting a lot of traction in this weather, but anyway.  So guys, just do the work.  Stop, like, quit your whining, quit your bitching.  Just get it done, man.  Just get it done.  Dig in, put your head down, get it done.  You know, if there's something you've always wanted to do, and you wanted to put your dent in the universe, but you're waking up in the morning with Cheeto dust on your fingers and your chin because you did nothing for the last 24 hours but sit around and watch sports or play video games or whatever, you got nobody to blame but yourself.  The guy that you look in the mirror every single day is the one letting you down.  Not the government, not Trump, not feminists, not the red pill, not me, you know, not not hypergamy, not not some like time in the 1950s that you'd like to go back to where hypergamy was under control and women were in check, blah, blah, blah.  I got news for you, fellas.  It's been like this for a long time.  It's only today that we have the internet that allows little beta bitches to go somewhere and whine and complain about what they're doing in life and how terrible the results are and why it's the fault of everybody else but themselves.  So gentlemen, this is a short one.  Quite simply, do the work. ",

I'm going to walk you through them one by one.  The first one is my men's private community.  I call this the 1%.  There is a video here on this page that explains in depth what's all involved there.  But to summarize, there is a premium video library of about three dozen videos that I've created.  I do at least one a month.  essentially a premium deliverable stuff that i can't publish on the channel.  that goes deep on several topics like creating wealth or getting an roi at 14 on your money understanding female nature betty better or the dynamics between men and women and how to optimize that we do monthly q a sessions.  there's a private forum that we use on facebook.  there's vip access to events and learning workshops.  we've got four incredible ones lined up anything from optimizing male hormones to dealing with long-term relationships, manufactured indignation and drama with women.  And we've got another one also coming up on open relationships and some business tips.  There's three tiers in here.  The basic membership gets you all that stuff that I just mentioned for $380 a year.  It's billed, In one shot, you get an annual membership for that.  You can take a look at this description over here to get more detail.  The business growth membership is for entrepreneurs only, but is currently full.  If you're interested in that in the future, when it opens up, you can join the waitlist.  There's also the premium membership.  If you're looking for one-on-one coaching, the minimum commitment for that is 90 days.  You can check that out by applying there.  I'll put a card up on the top right of the screen over here if you want to check that out.  The next link you want to take a look at is requesting a video.  If you are stuck on something and want to sponsor a topic, there's something you want me to cover.  If you've seen me do a video where I read over the email, this is where you do it.  Link up on the top right.  Follow the instructions here and you'll have an opportunity to sponsor video and get a recorded feedback from me.  And of course, you know, comments from hundreds, perhaps even thousands of other men in the chat section.  The next link I'm going to show you is my Clarity link, clarity.fm.  forward slash Richard Cooper card up on the top right over here is my one-off coaching link.  I've done well over 340 calls at the time of this recording.  Yes, I have. ",
