            "text": "The ground rules are very simple.  We came out here today to lecture and to answer questions.  Those of you who have a lecture and you would desire to lecture us, we got to say that you'll be wasting your time.  We will not take any lecture from anybody.  If you want to lecture, I would suggest you go along there.  raise a little platform, stand on it, begin to speak, and I guarantee you at least one idiot will come and listen to you.  But don't waste my time trying to lecture me.  I didn't come here to be lectured to, I came to talk and to answer questions.  If you have a question, I will endeavor to the best of my ability to answer your question.  First question, yes sir.  According to your understanding, do you have to follow the Quran specifically to be a Muslim?  The question from the gentleman to my left, he asked the question according to our understanding.  Do we have to follow the Holy Quran specifically to be a Muslim?  The answer is twofold.  First of all, the answer is most definitely yes.  Why?  Because it is the latest and last revelation from Almighty God Allah through a prophet.  And this book has within it tremendous guidance for the members of the human family regardless of their creed or their class or their color to come back to what's called the straight path or the of Almighty God Allah .  This is how you get back because this is a roadmap to getting back to that pristine submission to God.  However, the black man, our very nature is Islam.  We don't need a book.  to take us to our nature.  We need the book because we have forgotten our nature.  But once you start to read the book, the book will connect and resonate with your nature and after a while we can put the book down.  There are lots of Muslims who go into madrassas or Islamic schools and they learn the Quran by heart.  They learn to recite the Quran and they can say it.  But if you ask them, what does it mean?  They don't know to mean it.  And this is dangerous to just learn something by rote or by heart, but you don't actually know what it means.  And so, you know, we do need this, brother.  It is a very, very beautiful, pristine guidance from Almighty God Allah through the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.  And to be honest with you, brother, it's very sad and unfortunate, but you have Muslims who would never dream of touching a Bible.  Because, oh this is the Christians book.  But in this book it talks about this book.  In this book it acknowledges the Christians.  And all of the religions, bar none, they are all from Almighty God Allah.  All of them come from God.  But it's just that we are ignorant as followers and believers, and we think that the prophets taught different religions.  They didn't.  It's the same religion.  Just coming from a different direction.  So let me say, as I always say, your mother, your mom taught you that six and one is seven.  My mom taught me that five and two is seven.  His mom taught him that four and three is seven.  In our ignorance, we start fighting one another over which one of our mothers was right.  When all of our mothers taught us the same thing, just a different road or a different direction to get to the same place.  destination.  and that's the nature of the prophets teachings to humanity.  thank you very much for your question.
