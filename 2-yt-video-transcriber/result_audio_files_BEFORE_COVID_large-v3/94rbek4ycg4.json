This vital legislation will establish a new agency within the Department of Homeland Security to lead the federal government's civilian response to these cyber threats against our nation.  We've had many, many threats against our nation.  Cyber is gonna be the newest form, and the threats have taken place, and we've been doing pretty good at knocking them out, but now this will make us, I think, much more effective.  The men and women of the new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will be on the front lines of our cyber defense.  They will partner with the private sector and all levels of government to defend America's power grids, banks, telecommunications, and other critical parts of our economy.  The cyber battle space evolves, and it is evolving, and unfortunately, faster than a lot of people want to talk about, but battle space it is.  So as the cyber battle space evolves, this new agency will ensure that we confront the full range of threats from nation states, cyber criminals, and other malicious actors, of which there are many.

So that was the care that they were dangling out, and they wanted to see what the United States would give them to do that.  So that's why they ended up here in Hanoi.  The fact is, the North Koreans wanted way more than what the United States was willing to give, hence why the president walked away.  They clearly want all the sanctions lifted.  The president was very specific about that.  We now know that all this discussion about, oh, is President Trump going to give up troops in South Korea as a concession to Kim Jong-un?  Now it's pretty clear, I'm not sure Kim Jong-un really is all interested in all of that.  And that was never on the table in the first place.  so the president walked away.  what does this mean for the the china?  uh... situation the tried china negotiations.  look i take the president and secretary pompeo at face value that they were not satisfied with this deal.  i think there is a secondary benefit to the president that it sends a signaling message to the chinese that they will walk away from a deal that they're if if if he doesn't like the terms he's not so eager to have a win that hill.  take anything.  so But I don't think that's the primary motivation about why they walked away from this deal with North Korea.

What it's looking like is we might have a deal set by the end of March, but the question is whether tariffs will continue to still be around at the end of March, whether perhaps the tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports will remain, or perhaps all $250 billion worth of goods that are currently tariffed will be removed.  I think for sure, what markets are hopeful and what a lot of Americans would like to? ",

Quote, China has the ability to launch cyber attacks that cause localized temporary disruptive effects on American critical infrastructure, such as disruption of a natural gas pipeline for days to weeks in the United States.  Oh, and it's not just China.  Go to page six.  Quote, Russia has the ability to execute cyber attacks in the United States that generate localized temporary disruptive effects on critical infrastructure, such as disrupting an electrical distribution network for at least a few hours.  So China could shut off the natural gas pipelines.  Russia can just shut off the electricity.  They have that ability now. ",

The attacks are by a sophisticated set of actors.  Not clear exactly who's behind this.  And they began in May.  Here's what we know about which specific sectors are being targeted.  And as you say, it's a very long list here.  starting with nuclear, energy, aviation, water, and critical manufacturing, all being targeted by this mysterious hacking group that the government says has been active for several months and has penetrated some of those networks.  What do we know about?  who is behind this?  Not much definitively, but the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has said that they believe that this could be an entity they are calling Berserk Bear, which they say is affiliated with the Russian Federation.  And experts have said that what they're seeing here is aggressive activity, but no destructive action yet.  And they say that this campaign is still ongoing.  So it looks like what you've got here is an elaborate probe operation going into all of these sensitive industries in which the hackers are determined to figure out how those industries' networks work, maintain a maybe permanent presence in them.  To what end, though, is unclear.  Is this sort of a just-in-case kind of preparation for total war that intelligence agencies go through all the time, or is this the precursor to some more subtle, more narrow attack that could happen in the near future?  Not clear at all necessarily where this is going, but the US government wants people in those industries to know that this is happening and to take steps to stop it, guys. ",
