            "text": "Four years ago, HBO released a documentary about a man, Robert Durst, who is suspected of several murders.  The six-part series won two Emmys and a Peabody, stunning audiences with audio of Durst seemingly admitting to his alleged crimes.  The only problem?  A full transcript of what Durst actually said recently became public and shows that HBO selectively edited his words.  The admission in the documentary comes off camera as Durst goes into the bathroom with a hot mic still rolling.  Here's that scene.  What the hell are you doing?  some pretty damning lines spoken by the suspected murderer, if in fact he said that, and if in fact that was even in context, or even in that order.  But take a look, these two lines, killed them.  of course, what the hell did I do?  There's all this stuff they edited out in between.  which is outrageous.  I mean, this show won an Emmy for editing.  And they just took out all this stuff in the middle.  I wanted to do something new.  There's nothing new about that.  He was right, I was wrong.  The burping, I'm having difficulty with the question.  They just completely took that out and juxtaposed these two lines together.  We have never done anything as egregious like that in our entire careers.  Now, this is not the first time we've seen egregious, selective, and deceptive editing from the mainstream media only when the raw is provided.  Sometimes they don't provide the raw.  Sometimes we have to go out and get the raw.  In 2017, CNN had a voter panel with one of the individuals on the panel, the man in the middle there, took it upon himself to record the audio of the entire raw interview, but CNN doctored the tape and omitted relevant context.  Check this out.  Bill, are you sticking with that?  you've seen busloads or no? ",

And, I mean, has anybody looked into, like, what James O'Keefe has done when he went undercover to these various polling places?  I know, but no, he went in, he basically was ready to vote as somebody else.  Nobody asked for ID.  I was actually a poll watcher in New Jersey, and I saw what was going on there.  There were college students voting, and there was no, there was basically, you use a... That's right.  You use a provisional ballot and it's never challenged.  They just put it right through.  This is common. ",

            "text": "So Camerata was obviously trying to make them look like conspiracy theorists by doctoring out the later part of that tape where the person on the panel was in fact a poll watcher in New Jersey.  And they wanted the narrative to be that there was no such thing as voter fraud.  So they edited that out.  which is an egregious mistake that we have never made.  And after this occurred, Alison Camerata chose to remove herself from Twitter because she was being bombarded with individuals who were upset about the selective editing.  But you never hear about this stuff, do you?  Unless the citizen takes it upon themselves to record the raw audio.  And finally, we have the situation with the Katie Couric documentary.  Again, one of the most egregious bits of editing you will ever see. ",

They want to doctor footage to make people look bad, to get ratings, clicks, and influence, and prove some political narrative.  that doesn't happen to be true.  So what we need to do, it's incumbent upon the citizens to do, is to record them while they interview.  And people have sent us those recordings and we've made them public and made a difference.

We want you to be brave, do something, go to projectveritas.com slash brave and send us these raw audio recordings so we can put these people on blast and show people the truth. ",
