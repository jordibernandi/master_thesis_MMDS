            "text": "Alright everyone, listen up.  Mom and I are going out of town this weekend.  So please, make a mess, forget to feed the animals, and by all means, have a party.  Hey, keep looking at your phone while I'm talking to you, alright?  Look, whatever your friends are doing, do exactly the same thing, even if it involves a bridge.  Sure wish I had a smaller TV.  Bring back the black and whites.  All right, bills!  I just love when the kids talk back to me.  If you put a dent in the car, it's really no big deal.  Hey, don't put those back.  Just leave them wherever you want.  You don't need your own money.  I want to give you spending money.  Life is always fair.  Hey, we're all going to church, but you can sleep in.  Jesus will understand.  Hey, can we get some more bickering back there?  I don't care if you get detention.  Why limit yourself?  Go for a suspension.  It's 10 a.m Just go back to bed.  It's too early.  Hey, why don't you bring that ball inside and play with it?  If your friends are okay with it, of course I'm okay with it.  I really enjoy repeating myself over and over again.  Hey, when you're done pouring that, you can just leave it on the counter all day.  We'll make our own cottage cheese.  Thanks.  We got you that phone for a reason.  Texting girls.  Snapchat or chat snapping.  Whatever.  Yes!  Laundry!  The speed limit's just a suggestion.  Go as fast as you want.  Quick, go tell mom what happened.  Of course you don't need a chaperone.  We trust you.  Ooh, sports.  What channel's Hallmark on?  Please, whatever you do, forget about taking care of the pig.  I don't care if you get a job this summer.  You can live in my basement forever.  You don't need a seat belt.  Face imprints on windows are cool.  Woo-hoo, taxes.  No means maybe.  Yay, traffic.  Please throw a few parties while we're gone.  I can't open this door.  Go see if mom can do it.  Doesn't anybody want to know if we're there yet?  Are we there yet?  Are we there yet?  You don't need to finish your dinner.  Homeless children don't care.  You don't have to pass all your classes.  There's always summer school.  Hey, what are you doing?  Front flips.  Off the deck.  Hey, that's a great idea.  Can I get my seatbelt on?  No. ",
