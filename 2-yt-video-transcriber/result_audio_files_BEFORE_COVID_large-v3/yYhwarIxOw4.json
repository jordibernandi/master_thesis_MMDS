Fellow billionaire Tom Steyer has followed a similar strategy to gain a foothold in the Democratic primaries.  But can a television ad campaign turn into a winning campaign at the ballot box in 2020?  We asked FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver, do you buy that? ",

            "text": "So this is all a little bit of a science experiment.  No one has spent this much this fast in a presidential campaign before.  And the numbers we're talking about are truly gargantuan.  Michael Bloomberg has already spent more than $76 million on TV ads, all of it in just four weeks.  That's as much as the rest of the Democrats combined all cycle long.  Tom Steyer, meanwhile, has spent $57 million on TV, mostly in the early states.  By comparison, Bernie Sanders, who's raised more than any other Democrat from small donors, has spent only $4.6 million on TV.  But can money actually buy you votes?  Well, the initial returns are pretty mixed.  Steyer is polling anywhere between 3% and 6% in the early states.  That's better than his 1% or 2% of the vote nationally, but it doesn't put him on track to win any delegates, let alone any states.  Bloomberg, meanwhile, who's advertising all over the country, is at 4.8% international polling average.  That's good for fifth place.  but his return on investment isn't great.  He's only picked up two measly points since joining the campaign.  The key concept here is what economists call diminishing returns.  The first time you see a Steyr or a Bloomberg ad, it might move the needle, but the 15th ad probably won't.  You've hit the point of oversaturation.  Nor is paid media usually a good substitute for attention that comes more organically, like, say, during a debate.  Bloomberg hasn't qualified for the debates at all, and Steyer received the lowest marks of any of the seven candidates in their poll of Democratic voters after Thursday night's debate.  One more thing.  For highly engaged, attentive, informed voters, no amount of ad spending will peel them away from their favorite candidate, whether it's Bernie or Joe Biden or someone else.  And in fact, polls show that Bloomberg gets most of his support from people who are not paying very much attention to the campaign.  Look, obviously money can have a lot of influence in politics, but I don't buy that you can win a presidential nomination on the basis of advertising alone. ",
