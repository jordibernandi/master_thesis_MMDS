            "text": "The Bible warns us about the Antichrist spirit.  But what is the spirit of Antichrist and how do we recognize it?  And what do we do when we encounter it?  It's time to learn the lies.  Hey, welcome to UNLEARN.  My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we UNLEARN the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  If that sounds interesting to you, then subscribe to this channel and click the bell to be notified when new teachings are available.  Now let's get started.  The word antichrist is a combination of two Greek words, anti meaning against, opposite, and in place of, and Christos meaning anointed one.  An antichrist is an individual or group of people who oppose Christ.  Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Satanists, and Atheists are all anti-Christ because they all reject and oppose Yeshua as the Messiah and Son of God.  When Yeshua asked, Who do men say that I am?  He was given various answers.  Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.  But when He asked His disciples, Who do you say that I am?  They gave a clear confession of faith.  You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God.  This is something that's revealed by the Holy Spirit.  Therefore, I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.  It's only by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that we are able to say Yeshua is Lord.  To say Yeshua is Lord is the same as saying Yeshua is God.  He is King of kings and Lord of lords.  He is the Son of God in the fullness of the Godhead bodily.  He is Emmanuel, God with us.  He is the first and the last, the beginning and the end.  He is the creator and sustainer of all things.  He is God incarnate.  Yeshua is Lord.  All other religions deny the deity of Yeshua.  There are even heretical sects within Christianity that deny His deity.  They might recognize Him as a good teacher or prophet, but they reject His deity, so they cannot call Him Lord.  Everyone who denies the deity of Yeshua is being led astray by the spirit of Antichrist.  In fact, the whole world is under the influence of the Antichrist, except those who belong to Messiah.  We know that we are of God.  and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one.  This is why the Bible tells us to test the spirits, to see if they are of God or not, because there are many deceiving spirits that seek to lead us astray.  Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.  By this you know the Spirit of God, Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.  And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming and is now already in the world.  We are warned in the last days that many Antichrists will come from among us, denying that Yeshua is the Son of God, specifically denying that Yeshua came in the flesh.  This is a unique phrase that can only be used of God incarnate.  We cannot say that we came in the flesh because we have always been in the flesh.  We didn't come from anywhere else.  However, Yeshua came down from heaven and took on human flesh.  He came in the flesh.  Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation.  taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.  And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself, and he became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.  He is Emmanuel, God with us.  He is the image of the invisible God.  Only Yeshua can say, if you have seen Me, you have seen the Father, because the Father and the Son are one.  Yeshua left the glory He had with the Father in heaven, and He descended to earth to redeem us and to bring us into covenant with Him.  He died, was buried, resurrected, and ascended back to heaven where He lives eternally.  These are all things the Bible tells us about Him, and these are all things the Spirit of Antichrist rejects about Him.  Beware, lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of this world, and not according to Christ.  For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.  We are warned to test the spirits, we are warned about false teachers, and we are warned that many will fall away from the faith.  These warnings are given so that we might not be led astray.  Little children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many Antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour.  They went out from us, but they were not of us.  For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.  But they went out that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us.  But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.  I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  Who is a liar?  but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?  He is the Antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.  Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either.  He who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.  Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning.  If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.  And this is the promise that He has promised us, eternal life.  These things I have written to you concerning those who try to deceive you.  If they reject the Son, they reject the Father.  Because Yeshua said, I and my Father are one.  And if you have seen me, you have seen the Father.  Jews and Muslims both say, God has no Son.  If you say God has no Son, then you are saying God is not a Father.  You are denying both the Father and the Son when you reject the Son.  But if you confess that Yeshua is the Son of God, you are acknowledging that God is the Father and you receive both the Father and the Son.  It's only by confessing that Yeshua is the Son of God that we can know the Father.  He is the way, the truth, and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through Him.  We are beginning to see more and more people turning away from Yeshua.  Some turn to Judaism, some to Islam, and others simply become secular and unbelieving.  What they don't realize is that it doesn't matter which path they choose, because any path that denies Yeshua is the path to destruction.  Some people are deceived into thinking there are many paths, but there are only two paths, the wide road that leads to destruction and the narrow road that leads to life.  The wide road rejects Yeshua, but the narrow road is Yeshua.  So what are we supposed to do when someone we know walks away from Yeshua?  The Bible tells us we cannot continue having fellowship with them, because what fellowship can light have with darkness?  In fact, the Bible even tells us not to greet them.  For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh.  This is a deceiver and an antichrist.  Look to yourselves that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive the full reward.  Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God.  He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.  If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him, for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.  We are told not to invite them into our house or even greet them.  Why are we given such stern warnings to avoid these people?  Because we follow Yeshua.  He is our king, and those people have committed treason against our king.  They are rebellious against him, and we can't have fellowship with someone like that.  Think about it this way.  If you hang out with criminals, you're an associate of them, and you might become incriminated by your association.  They will also have a negative influence on you that may lead you to become a criminal as well.  In my experience with those who reject Yeshua, one thing I've noticed is they all become evangelists for the Antichrist.  They become anti-missionaries who try to get others to reject Yeshua.  They can't let you worship Yeshua because they feel a strong compulsion to lead you away from Him.  That's why we are warned to avoid them and no longer have fellowship with them.  But what do we do if that person is a family member?  Or worse yet, what if it's your own husband or wife?  Yeshua gives us a very clear answer.  Therefore, whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven.  but whoever denies me before men him will i also deny before my father who is in heaven?  do not think that i came to bring peace on earth.  i did not come to bring peace but a sword for i have come to set a man against his father a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and A man's enemies will be those of his own household.  We are instructed to love Yeshua more than anyone else.  Love Yeshua more than your husband.  Love Him more than your wife.  Love Him more than your children or your parents.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.  If your husband or wife is not following Yeshua, then they are not walking with you.  You can't walk with Yeshua and someone who rejects Him.  You'll have to make a choice.  You'll have to either neglect your spouse to love Yeshua, or you'll neglect Yeshua to love your spouse.  If you do not love Yeshua more than these, you are not worthy to be His disciple.  Thanks for watching.
