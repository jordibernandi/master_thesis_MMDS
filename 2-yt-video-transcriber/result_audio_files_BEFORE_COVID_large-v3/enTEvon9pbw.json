All your bills will be paid, your adulthood delayed, and I'll give all this money to you.  Bob commuted to college for discounted knowledge so large debts he would not accrue.  Lived at home, did some chores.  Now he'll also pay yours.  Wait, I didn't agree to that.  Because I'll give all his money to you.  I already paid off my loans.  All this money you will get from Bob.  I lived in a basement for four years.  All this money if I get this job.  My school didn't have a rock climbing wall.  All your work wages risen.  Your debts are forgiven.  Your child care will be paid for too.  One free parental leave just takes one vote from me.  And I'll give all this money to you.  Oh, give me a break.  This is really getting ridiculous.  I drink tap water.  You know what?  I'm leaving.  All Bob's money.  All Bob's money.  All Bob's money.  I will give to you.  Communists.  Sigh. ",
