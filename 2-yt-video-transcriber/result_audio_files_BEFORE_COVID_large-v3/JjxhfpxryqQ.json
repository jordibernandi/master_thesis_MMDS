            "text": "Mercenaries are always interesting.  They certainly have a very exciting occupation, and soldiers of fortune most often have the best stories.  But sometimes, things can go wrong.  Things can go very wrong.  Simon Mann.  Simon Mann.  Oh, man.  Simon Francis Mann was born on 26th June 1952.  His father was the captain of the English cricket team in the 40s and his mother was a South African national.  He was also an heir to the Watney Mann brewing empire so he had a bit of an English upper class upbringing.  He studied at Eton College and upon graduating he enlisted in the military and he trained to be an officer at Sandhurst.  He was commissioned into the Scots Guards and by 1976 he held the rank of Lieutenant.  He later joined the SAS and he served in Cyprus, Germany, Norway and Northern Ireland before leaving the military in 1985.  He was however recalled back out of the reserves so that he could be deployed in the Gulf War.  After the Gulf War, Mann entered the oil industry as a security consultant along with his friend Tony Buckingham and in 1993, rebels in Angola had seized the port of Soyo and seized its oil installations.  This affected Simon and Tony because their company actually owned some of the oil installations in Soyo, so this had the potential to completely ruin their business.  The Angolan government required mercenaries, sorry, not mercenaries, private military contractors to seize the port back from the rebels.  Mann also had a financial interest in seizing the port back and Mann also knew a lot of highly trained personnel who were all looking for work.  There were a lot of military personnel looking for work around this time because apartheid was starting to fall in South Africa and as a result of that a lot of military units were getting shut down.  Soldiers were losing their jobs and their pensions.  So they needed work.  So it was quite easy for Mann to gather a large enough team to lead an operation in taking back the port.  They were successful in taking back the port but as a result Mann made a few enemies because it is rumoured that the rebels who took the port were actually backed by the CIA.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Through Mann working with these contractors, he and Buckingham decided to start their own private military company, or PMC, and they named this company Executive Outcomes.  The problem with this is Mann has given some conflicting statements about the origin of Executive Outcomes.  In some instances he said that he wasn't involved with it at all, in some instances he said he only worked alongside them, and in some instances he said that he was the founder.  But A lot of sources point to him actually being the founder.  A lot of people came on board with Executive Outcomes and they ended up amassing 2,000 staff with another 3,000 in the sidelines waiting to join when their name got called.  The company operates mostly in Africa but in 1997 the government of Papua New Guinea wanted to hire Executive Outcomes to help them quell a rebellion in Bougainville because peace talks between the government and the rebels had fell through.  As this was outside Executive Outcome's area of operation, they decided to subcontract the job to another PMC called Sandline International.  The Papua New Guinea government using mercenaries to quell a rebellion was viewed as a scandal.  that was called the Sandline Affair.  However, the operation was apparently successful and it netted Executive Outcome's $10 million.  Simon Mann and Executive Outcomes were also hired to quell a rebellion that was happening in Sierra Leone.  Revolutionary United Front rebels were trying to overthrow the government and Executive Outcomes actually managed to stop them.  For the most part.  Simon Mann confirmed in an interview that the UN would constantly bitch about and badmouth Executive Outcomes, but Simon went on to confirm that in both of the uprisings that happened in Angola and Sierra Leone, the UN were present and were completely useless and in many instances would actually radio executive outcomes for help whenever they got into trouble.  Simon Mann then also started a diamond mining firm that had locations in Angola and Sierra Leone and he was still taking PMC contracts.  so he was making an awful lot of money and he became a very wealthy man and a lot of this money got invested back into executive outcomes so that they could purchase some serious hardware.  The hardware ranged from Hind helicopter gunships, armoured personnel carriers, a Boeing 727 and even T-72 tanks, but none of these were owned by Executive Outcomes, they were owned by the client states.  Clever.  Mann even found himself starring in the movie Bloody Sunday where he himself played Colonel Wilford.  So things were going very well for Mann and Executive Outcomes.  Until 2004, when they were approached by some very major but very secretive investors who presented them with a very unusual contract.  A contract that they accepted.  They weren't hired to stop a rebellion.  They weren't hired to stop terrorists.  They weren't hired to protect a government.  They were hired to overthrow a government.  The contract was accepted and Simon Mann assembled his usual team, but in this instance he brought along another PMC that was led by a man called Nick Dutoy.  The goal was to overthrow the dictator of Equatorial Guinea, Teodora Mbasogo, who would then be replaced by another man.  One could obviously safely assume that this other man would be a puppet who would obviously give some kind of benefit to the investors that were backing the coup.  One thing to note about Equatorial Guinea is it's a very oil-rich country.  Just keep that in mind.  The plan was Nick Dutoy and 14 other men would be waiting in Equatorial Guinea.  Simon Mann and his team would load up Executive Outcome's Boeing 727 with all of their soldiers, weapons and resources.  They would then fly from where they were to Zimbabwe so that they could pick up another cache of weapons that they'd ordered.  Once they had this cache of weapons they would fly from Zimbabwe to Equatorial Guinea and begin the coup.  However, the instant Simon and his team landed in Zimbabwe, the plane was immediately surrounded by the Zimbabwean armed forces, and Simon and the other 69 people on board were all arrested.  Everything was then seized by the Zimbabwean armed forces.  All of the weapons on board the plane, the weapons cache that they were picking up, the plane itself, as well as 180,000 US dollars in cash that was on board the plane that most likely was going to be used to buy the weapons cash that they were picking up.  It turns out that the Zimbabwean Armed Forces had been waiting at the airport for three days for Simon and his team to arrive.  They knew they were coming and they knew about the coup.  Also in Equatorial Guinea, Nick Dutoy and all of his men were arrested for their involvement in the coup and all of these men faced the death penalty.  Nick Dutoy and his men were tortured regularly and it's also been confirmed that one of Nick's men was actually beaten to death during interrogation.  Nick also confirmed that the confession he signed was fake and the only reason that he signed it is because the guards kept beating him and they said that they wouldn't stop until he signed.  In Zimbabwe, Simon Mann was placed on trial accused of attempting to buy illegal weapons for use in a coup plot and he was sentenced to seven years in a Zimbabwean prison.  In Equatorial Guinea, Nick Dutoy and the rest of his men were found guilty of attempting a coup and they were sentenced to 34 years each.  So, What the fuck happened?  How did they all get caught and how did Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea know they were coming?  Well, it turns out that someone who was involved in the coup got a little bit spooked in the lead up to it and they did something very stupid.  It turns out in the lead up to the coup, Nick Dutoy was having second thoughts.  He was starting to get scared and he didn't want to go through with it anymore.  This resulted in him having an argument with Simon Mann, where Simon Mann told Nick that the people financing the coup were very, very powerful and very influential, and that if they backed out now, the investors would have them killed.  This spooked Nick so much that he went to the DSO, which is the South African equivalent of the FBI, and he told them everything.  And they just took all of the information and let Nick go on his way.  And obviously this information then somehow found its way to Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea.  And that's how they knew they were coming.  In 2007, when Simon Mann was still in prison, the Zimbabwean government ruled that he should be extradited to Equatorial Guinea to face charges.  Simon knew that if he went there he was fucked, so he submitted an appeal against his extradition to the Zimbabwean Supreme Court.  However, the very next day after Simon submitted his appeal, the Zimbabwean government just went, nah, fuck that, and secretly removed him from prison, put him on a plane, and just sent him to Equatorial Guinea.  It was later revealed that Mugabe had struck a deal with Mbisogo to hand over Simon Mann in exchange for a lot of oil.  Simon was then sent to the most notorious place in Equatorial Guinea.  Black Beach Prison.  This prison is widely recognised as literally the worst prison on Earth.  Simon was shit out of luck.  He was going to be doomed to spend the rest of his days in one of the worst prisons on the planet.  Simon did however send a letter to his wife from Black Beach Prison.  This letter actually got intercepted by South African intelligence and in the letter Simon says the code names of two of the investors that were back in the coup.  Simon said in the letter that the only two people who could get him out now were Smelly and Scratcher.  Simon seemed very sure that the investors would do everything that they could to get him out of prison.  But they didn't.  It seems that Smelly and Scratcher had just abandoned Simon to rot away forever in this hellhole.  This made Simon very resentful.  In 2008, Channel 4 managed to get access to Simon in Black Beach Prison so that they could conduct an interview.  And Simon just started rounding off all of the real names of all of the investors who backed the coup.  Mann then instructed his accountant, James Kershaw, to compile an official list of all of the investors who financed the coup.  And this list was called the Wonga List.  Kershaw handed himself in to the police along with the list.  Kershaw was then immediately placed into witness protection under 24 hour surveillance due to high risk concerns of him being assassinated.  And so began a long investigation into all of the financial backers of the coup.  I've got a list of their names here so I'm just going to read it from here just to make sure I get it right.  Karine Falaha, director of a trading and investment firm based in Beirut.  Greg Wales, a property tycoon.  Gary Hersham, another property tycoon.  David Tremaine, a very wealthy businessman.  And, that's interesting, Lord Geoffrey Archer, who at one point in his life had been an MP for the Tories.  In fact, when you look at a lot of the people on this list... it seems a lot of them have strong ties to the Tory party.  But that still leaves the question of the two codenames.  Well, it turns out that Smelly was a man named Eli Khalil, who was an oil magnate.  Now, why would an oil magnate want to install a puppet government in an oil-rich nation?  Boggles the mind.  But that leaves the final codename, Scratcher.  And if we go along with the trend that we've seen so far, what name rhymes with scratcher and is associated with the Tory party?  Come on, think.  Dank, think.  You know this one.  It's right on the tip of my tongue.  No, not her.  Her son, Mark Thatcher.  Mark Thatcher was arrested, charged and found guilty of financially backing the coup.  Despite the extreme severity of the crime, he was only given a $270,000 fine and a four year suspended sentence, meaning that he didn't go to jail at all.  Looks like somebody got a favour from mummy.  There were more backers to the coup but their donations were completely untraceable and they never get caught.  But despite all this, Simon Mann was still in prison and he was trying his hardest to secure a deal with the government of Equatorial Guinea to secure his release. ",

            "text": "However, in November of 2009, Simon Mann was mysteriously and suddenly given a full pardon by the Equatorial Guinean government on humanitarian grounds.  As soon as he was released, he immediately came back to Britain.  He still currently lives in Britain, but executive outcomes doesn't exist anymore and they have ceased all operations.  Allegedly.  As for what he's doing now, he still constantly speaks out about the investors that abandoned him to his unfair fate in prison.  And see, to be perfectly honest, I would be a little bit concerned if I had pissed off an ex-SAS mercenary.  Actually, funnily enough, one of the investors, Eli Khalil, was actually found dead in his home last year after an apparent fall down the stairs.  But the police ruled his death as unexplained and one of Eli's friends confirmed that Eli's neck had been completely broken.  Fuck.  It's Count Dankula on YouTube.  Everybody should subscribe. ",
