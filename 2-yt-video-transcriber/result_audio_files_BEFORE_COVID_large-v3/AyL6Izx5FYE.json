            "text": "Like I said, you know, it's always tragic whenever anyone crosses over and passes away based on some tragic event.  And, of course, now you know everybody's talking about Kobe, but this is what's really troubling.  You got some touting the universe and... You know, all types of, you know, kind of like Illuminati cultic type talk and everything.  Everybody's talking about how sad it is.  But again, it is sad.  But watch this.  I'm going to say what Jesus said.  What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?  Now, I don't know his spiritual condition.  But from everything I do know from the word... I don't know.  I mean, was he a commandment keeper?  Did he keep the commandments?  Because, I mean, just like my brother Kabir Bajabir Amelia said the other day, Ecclesiastics teaches us and tell us, for let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.  Fear Yah and keep his commandments because this is the whole duty of man.  You won't see nobody talking about Jesus, the real Jesus, not the false, fake, phony, hypocritical Jesus that Christianity talks about because that's another Jesus.  I told you, man, this world is just literally something else.  Okay, so... keeping the commandments, being filled with the Holy Spirit.  It's paramount in the day that we're living in.  Sure, everybody's heart is hurting because they're going to be missing Kobe Bryant.  Really, they're going to be missing him.  But why don't anybody ever talk about the importance of being quote-unquote saved?  It's like the news media, the players, they all got a gag order on their mouth or something, especially when it comes to talking about The Messiah, nobody seems to want to give him any accolades or credit or anything.  You know, the one who died for you and I sinned.  And then you got all these wicked witchcraft people out here that they'll go in on that too.  Ain't nobody dying for nobody.  But you know what?  You can only imagine facing sudden death.  You can only imagine.  And right now, people, they should be doing some soul searching.  I remember when I was in the military, and Coach, you know, was being a paratrooper, I've experienced being around a little bit of death in the military.  And it's just odd.  It's really odd when you are sitting here in formation with a brother that you did PT with, you ate with, you trained with, On a daily, went on missions with, on a daily.  And then the very next day, he is no longer there.  I mean, I remember one time, I think this was at Fort Chaffee when I was up there in Op 4.  And of course, it was a night jump.  And we was getting shooted up.  The first plane had already taken off.  Got wind that a paratrooper died on a night jump.  And, man, I tell you, I know what that feels like.  So I'm not insensitive about any stretch of imagination.  But it was only a feeling because, see, at that time, I wasn't saved.  I wasn't saved at all.  It was just one of those things.  Fear.  Fear.  It talks to you.  It comes to you.  Death.  The voice of death.  You're going to start hearing it then, especially if you don't have your name written down in the Lamb's Book of Life.  You're not keeping his commandments.  You're not filled with his Holy Spirit.  You're not trying to be holy and live holy.  Man, it talks.  And everybody getting talked to, they getting ministered to right now.  I promise you that.  But I remember... That that gentleman turned around and got a bird and we were up in the air in less than, I know it was anywhere from 12 to 18 hours.  Having everybody to jump again.  Why?  Because you had to overcome that fear factor.  You got to be able to look at it and stare it right in the face.  And I tell you, man, because it makes you have thoughts.  Man, what the hell am I doing?  I want to end my life like this?  Man, I'm what?  All these thoughts come in your head.  So now is the time and opportunity for all these popular people in the world that has made a hell of a lot of money.  You know, the majority of them, there's nothing forgotten in their community, forgotten y'all because people think that money is a refuge nowadays and that you can hide and protect yourself.  Gold is not going to deliver you on a day of death.  You can't take it with you.  So instead of hoarding it and everything else, better do something with it while you got it.  And hopefully you're doing something good for the kingdom.  Now, see, this is talk that nobody likes hearing.  Nobody likes talking about, but see, this is the most opportune time to talk about this because the people that are dead and crossed over to death, and I said it once, I said it a thousand times, you could pass by a cemetery and see that people are going to spend a hell of a lot more time in death than they are in life.  And we call this life because we're here in this, this little fantasy world, this make-believe that we're only allotted like just a little bit space of time.  Our life is like a vapor of mist.  We're here and then we're gone.  But eternity, that's forever.  Death is really life because either way it goes, you're going to cross over into it.  And how you carry yourself, what you represent it, If you were, were you a servant of the Messiah?  Because we all see that the people, they're definitely serving the devil.  There ain't no doubt about that.  People are making no apologies, serving the devil.  Look at the rap music.  Look at Rihanna and all these other people that throw up Mason signs and all kinds of stuff going on.  Glorifying Satan.  People making no apologies for it.  But man, you're getting ready to get castrated and tattooed and you start talking about Jesus Christ, Yahshua HaMashiach.  You start talking about him?  Oh man, now they want to try to make you the devil.  It's a sad thing, but it's a reality.  My advice and suggestion is, is that... You get your heart and your life straight right now while it's in your conscious.  Because in a week or two, it's going to blow over.  It's going to blow over just like every news story.  They come out and they report on it hard.  And within a week or so, it's gone.  It's gone.  Forgotten about, distant memory.  That's it.  but your eternal soul salvation is forever, ever.  And if you don't have Messiah, if you ain't repenting of your sins, you haven't turned from iniquities and transgressions, it's over.  It is over.  Yeah, basically what we do in this life is gonna echo throughout all of eternity.  And so, many of you, A lot of people on this YouTube, everything's funny, trolling, stupid sayings, just a worthless life some of you have out there.  Just literally worthless.  Some of you, you're actually doing a hell of a lot of good with it.  You are the ones I salute.  I do.  But I'm telling you, man, people had better sober up.  I'm serious.  Because... We're all a one breath away from eternity.  And of course, people, I don't believe that.  I don't believe that.  Hey, that's your prerogative.  But I do know this.  You're going to believe when you cross over.  You know, there's a book.  some time ago, I don't know exactly the title, it just pops up in my head, but it was a book written about 100-something years ago about the people, the death of the wicked, the death of atheists, the death of deists, the death of agnostics, and the type of deaths that they experienced and the things that was going on with them when they were on their deathbed.  Because you remember, a long, long time ago, they didn't rush you off to an ambulance, in an ambulance to a hospital and then pump you up with morphine.  And I've seen something like that.  Man, I remember this one lady passed away and she was having an aneurysm.  And they had her hooked up on morphine.  And she used to actually go to assembly with us.  She did it for maybe a week or two, maybe a couple of weeks.  And of course, you know, we was in there casting out devils because that's what believers do according to Mark 16, verse 17, 15, 16, 17.  And, man, that scared the living hell out of her.  And don't you know?  this woman left there and then totally fell out of the faith, didn't even believe in y'all no more, claimed to be a deist, and on her deathbed while she was having an aneurysm.  This is real.  This is a real true life story.  As a matter of fact, Sister Ashley's grandmother.  And she was out, totally out, and all of a sudden she was just out of nowhere raised up in the bed and just, whoo-ah!  I mean, just the most horrific sounds you've ever heard in your life.  You're like, what the world?  And Ashley's mother said to me, she said, Pastor, it's like she was going down into the pit.  And there's nothing no one could do about it.  You deny Jesus Christ in life, he would deny you in death.  better repent, turn from your wicked ways, start listening to a real true bonafide preacher like me, that's Jeremiah 3.15.  And I will give you passes according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.  Let me say this.  I put a lot of good content on my Patreon account.  You can go back to my videos and see.  My suggestion is if you're serious and you're a serious minded person, I'm sure there are a few serious minded preachers out there.  I don't know none that's more serious minded than I am concerning your soul salvation.  But you may want to consider becoming a fellow helper in the work and really truly getting serious about life while this is in your mind.  Because it's easy to start letting things slip. ",
