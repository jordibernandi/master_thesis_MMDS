            "text": "day everybody got upset I got all these people in my damn inbox talking about look at this look at this look at this.  okay I'll look at it but y'all know I'm not gonna jump on the bandwagon with you just because you fail to understand.  Nothing happens in a vacuum.  and don't nobody act like they want to admit to that shit no more.  So you know what?  Even though I'm always coming to the aid of my people, even though I'm always the one to say I love my people, even though I'm always the one that's trying to make other people understand why our perspective needs to be respected and inspected and it's a retrospect in the context of what needs to be said.  Even though I'm always the dude doing that, even though I'm always on the front line, even though I'm always trying to dig for the real facts.  If there's one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to stand by and jump on the bandwagon of stupidity.  Y'all got to stop ignoring the bullshit that we do.  That puts us into certain situations with these clown ass people who like to call themselves the cops.  Everybody want to talk about the fact that the boy got slammed on the ground.  Now I'm going to ask everybody watching an honest question.  Everybody, whether I know you or not.  If we was walking down the street together, me and you hanging out, chilling, talking, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And somebody you didn't know walked up on you and spit on you.  Being what the world is today, being that there are fatal diseases, that there are genetics inside of your saliva, the DNA.  And I'm going to throw that on you.  In this world where people travel from one side of the world to the other in a matter of hours from different countries, bringing all kinds of diseases.  It's not that they're going to die.  Your body ain't used to it.  You throw your bodily fluids on another person.  I used to always hear my mother say, if somebody was trying to break in the house, she would go downstairs and have a roasting pan of hot piss and throw it on them.  Now, me as a kid, I used to wonder, where the fuck you can get all this piss from?  But that's irrelevant.  It was just the thought of somebody throwing hot urine on you.  And you stand there, and you're like, I know this motherfucker didn't throw this piss on me.  If someone spits on you, What would you do?  And don't try and be cute.  They're all civilized.  What would you really do?  Just walk up.  Blah!  What would you do?  Now look here, fam.  To walk down a public street and consume alcohol, which everybody knows is illegal.  That's why we got the brown paper bag.  We got game on the block.  You know how to drink in public.  He was already wrong, cat.  It wasn't that big a deal.  I understand it's the holiday.  You're a little turnt up.  But okay.  But it's Thanksgiving.  You know they're out there.  But you go out there anyway.  Okay.  And a hot boy saw you.  Apparently you didn't disguise it too well because he pulled up.  He had to pull up on you.  And then he pulls up.  You know, you've probably been drinking.  You feel like I got that liquid courage flowing through you.  So what you do?  Instead of just pour the drink out or whatever the hell it is, bruh, bruh, you know, whatever.  You gonna spit on the cop?  You spit on the cop, bruh?  Now, I know he probably got a body cam for this.  that's gonna come out.  Because you know we're gonna ask to see it.  You spit on him, bro.  Because he told you you couldn't drink in public.  That's about as stupid as pointing a pistol at a bunch of cops.  You know that's suicide by a cop.  You spit on this motherfucker in Chicago?  Nigga, you ain't juicy.  You damn right.  he picked your ass up and slammed you on the goddamn ground.  I would have done the same thing.  I probably would have done more than that.  But don't nobody want to talk about that.  Well, he could have done some other thing.  What would you have done?  Now don't sit there and give me that Martin Luther King.  I would have turned that other cheek.  Let me walk up on you tomorrow.  I'm just going to spit in your face.  People are nasty.  People are unhealthy.  People got all kinds of shit in their system.  But it's okay if you spit that shit out.  Don't you know you absorb shit through your skin?  Why do you think there are some animals that their defense mechanism is to spit something on you?  Because when it hits your skin, it has an effect.  Sink in to you.  And I accidentally spit out my mouth.  Oh, bro, I'm the most apologetic dude.  I'm wiping you down.  I'm asking you, do you want me to buy you something to help you out?  Whatever.  I'm saying sorry a thousand times.  That was an accident.  You know how much hatred I would have to have in me for me to spit on you?  Because I already know what's coming.  That's the quickest way to start a fight.  You want to really start a fight with a motherfucker?  Don't even go in there and say that.  Just walk up to a motherfucker and the fight is popping.  If not, I got a question.  I'm sorry.  I got a question.  What kind of person you are?  I'm a peaceful brother, too, but there's boundaries, bro.  But this spitting, I'm sorry, y'all.  I'm sorry.  I know this is going to hurt some people still.  You didn't birth another person to be able to spit on them.  Hell, if my mother spit on me, we have a real strange relationship.  You know what I mean?  Like, mom, really, mom, that's what we have?  Pops, we spitting on niggas out here?  What's this shit?  I'm in the wrong fucking family.  That is so disrespectful.  So don't everybody get in an uproar when you see the video unless you know the context of why he grabbed you and what was going on.  And the whole situation as far as I'm concerned is, I hate to say it, but they can say the cop lost his temper.  What was he supposed to do, pull out a handkerchief and be like, well, you know, we're not going to have that.  I keep asking you, what would you have done?  Put yourself in that position.  You own your job, whatever your job is.  A lot of y'all do a lot of different stuff.  But imagine somebody came in your job for whatever the business of the job was.  McDonald's, the office, working in the airport.  I don't know, anywhere.  Sitting in your own business.  Somebody came in and spit on you. ",
