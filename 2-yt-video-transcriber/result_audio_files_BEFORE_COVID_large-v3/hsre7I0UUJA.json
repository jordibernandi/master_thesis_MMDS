            "text": "The government helped themselves to the life savings of my grandparents and my father.  Describe how you felt that day.  Insulted.  I felt that my father and his father before him worked very hard for this money, and I'm merely taking it from one state to another to take care of my father.  And the fact that someone can put their hand into my pocket and just take it without cause was insulting as an American.  My dad is 79 years old.  He has always been a larger than life personality.  He has worked really, really hard over his entire career to support my brothers and myself.  He's just one of those guys in the town that everyone loves.  He'd do anything for anyone.  Like anyone who had gone through the Great Depression, my grandparents were suspect of banks and would hide money that they had saved up in little niches in their home.  And my dad picked up on that and would do the same for decades and decades after.  When we moved my father from this home into a one-bedroom apartment, he no longer had those nooks and crannies to squirrel away this cash.  I had gone down to Pittsburgh and normally when I go down to see my dad, I will review my dad's finances with him.  And this particular time, he mentioned to me that he had this large amount of cash that he wanted me to bring back and manage for him.  Between my grandparents and my father, they had set aside a bit over $80,000.  The plans for the money were to facilitate my dad's oral care.  It's going to be quite costly to get new dentures and things like that, and he also needed some significant truck repairs.  I took my dad to lunch that Saturday.  By the time I was told of the money, it was after the banks had closed.  My flight was leaving at 8 a.m.  Monday morning, so I had no alternative but to take it with me.  I actually had looked it up on the Internet the day before, and it said domestically you can take any amount of cash to the airport, which is what I relied on and thought there would be no problem.  I went to the airport into TSA, had my boarding pass stamped, put my bag on the belt.  And as it was going through the belt, the TSA agent called out for assistance saying that she has something.  And I said, oh, that's cash I'm taking to Massachusetts.  The TSA agent called a state trooper.  Then the trooper came and asked me a bunch of questions.  What are you doing with the money?  Where are you taking it?  Where did it come from?  at which point I gave him all the information that I had already provided.  And then the lieutenant came over, asked me the exact same questions once again, and they said, that's fine.  Told me that I was free to go and take my bag with me.  I was early enough.  I had some breakfast, went to the gate.  I started doing some work, and I was approached by the same trooper and a gentleman who tapped me on the shoulder and said, Ms.  Brown, I'd like to speak to you.  He said, I'm from the DEA.  I'd like to talk to you about the money.  Can you show it to me?  I opened my bag.  He asked me the same questions.  Where did you get it?  What are you doing with it?  And when I told him, he said, I'd like to speak to your father.  I said to him that it's 7 o'clock in the morning.  My dad's 79 years old.  Calling him is just going to alarm him.  And he said, I need to verify your story.  So he had me dial my father, who was awakened and quite confused and upset.  and he answered the questions that the DEA agent gave him.  The DEA agent turned around and said that your story doesn't match.  Your fathers were taking this money and gave me a piece of paper in return and left.  My dad was left to just worry for two and a half hours.  When I landed, there was seven voicemails from him terrified that I had either been arrested or something bad had happened to me.  And that was my horrible day.  The DEA seized the cash on August 26th, a Monday, and I heard nothing from the DEA until mid-October.  And neither my father nor I have been charged with any crime.  I believe that the government has overstepped.  I am a true patriotic American.  I work hard.  I pay my taxes.  I've raised a family.  I love America.  What I don't love is the overreach of the government, and this is a blatant overreach.  My grandparents and father saved their entire lives, and taking it out of the pocket of my father when he so direly needs it, it's just a horrible, horrible thing. ",
