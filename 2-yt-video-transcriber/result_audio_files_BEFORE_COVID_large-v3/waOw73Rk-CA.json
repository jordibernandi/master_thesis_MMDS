What's today, Veterans Day?  Veterans Day?  Is that crazy?  No, no, it's not crazy.  What's up, man?  How is everybody doing, man?  I hope you guys had a great weekend.  What's up, CEO Frank?  Everybody, I want you guys to follow me on Instagram at KingFlexENT.  KingFlex Entertainment is KingFlexENT because they're messing with my account.  Um, they're arbitrarily flagging, uh, random videos, just calling it harassment and bullying.  I mean, they just falsely flag.  There's a video of me sitting with my kids and they call it harassment and bullying.  So Instagram is messing with my, my, um, page.  They got, they got orders to mess with the page.  So yeah, King Flex EMC.  Y'all follow that right now.  Let me tell you something.  Ever since we announced the foundation of black American, um, um event there has been havoc.  they really don't want us to have that convention.  family when they had the revolt convention it was sponsored by big money.  they charged the group to get in.  they were in there talking about nothing burgers.  they were in there.  twerking y'all didn't see this kind of pushback.  You did not see this kind of pushback for the revolt summit at all.  The minute I announced the foundational black American conference, well, we're going to have a real damn discussion.  Dude, pages have been getting flagged.  I've been getting attacked.  Just a barrage of attacks.  Then the whole thing with red tone, that thing.  Because of the F the foundation of black American conference.  I mean, these attacks are just popping up.  It's like, my brothers are like zombies popping out of everywhere.  Um, I think I do.  Um, Oh shit.  What man is your brother?  Black man.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We're going to get this black man some money over here.  On the freeway.  Hold on.  You sure he's black or he ain't dirty or dusty?  Yeah, because I thought I saw a brother earlier.  Just a dirty white man.  Oh, no.  What's wrong with the sea?  I'm getting out the freeway.  Give him a $20.  I'm going to get his brother $20.  Hold on.  This is our brother right here.  There you go.  Yeah, it is.  Here you go, brother.  All right, brother.  There we go.  I hope that brother don't go by no crack with that 20 goddamn dollars.  We'll get you something to eat, brother.  He didn't notice.  Oh, he didn't look at it?  He probably thought it was just a dollar.  Oh, she's popping out chicken for everybody.  Everybody's going to go down and get them a sandwich.  But, yeah, like I said, listen, listen, fam.  I'm going to go on live a little bit later, too, to go into some more details about stuff.  A little bit, a little bit.  But they do not want us to have this summit.  I mean, they're sending all of their minions out to talk down on this thing.  This thing is something that they're trying to sabotage.  You know, Kickstarter took it down and they had to put it back on Indiegogo.  So we're back up.  We're a little over 30,000 again, family.  If you guys want to get involved, man, let me go to Indiegogo, type in Foundational Black American Conference.  The only way we can make this thing happen, everybody go ahead and get your pre-sale tickets because that's all we're doing.  The money is basically us pre-selling the tickets.  That's all it is.  Everybody needs to get involved with y'all for real because this shit is real out here.  This shit is real out here, family.  You understand?  You want to meet me?  I would like to meet you guys.  Come on down, ma'am.  Again, when you contribute to the Indiegogo, basically that's your admission to get in.  You'll get in.  So we're just pre-selling the tickets.  So... Go ahead and get your advance tickets and come on in.  And, man, let's chop that thing up.  Go to Indiegogo and contribute.  If you guys are serious, see, we got to be serious about this thing.  Because that's why I wanted to, everybody wanted me to do it.  And everybody wanted me to get involved and put it together.  And I'm putting it together.  And we see the pushback.  This is why I said, look, if we do this shit, everybody's going to have to be on board.  I ain't going to take all these lumps and bruises by my goddamn self out here.  Because there's a major pushback and they do not want us to get together and be on the same page and have an agenda, a real agenda.  They're going out of their way to fund events so that we do not have an agenda, so that we do not go to these politicians and demand that we get something tangible.  What, Bunny?  He's right here.  I'm right here.  What are you talking about?  I'm right here.  What are you talking about?  I want to go that way.  You want to go?  You don't even know what's that way, Mateo.  What's that way?  They know that this is not the way to the place.  Okay, they're like, get your ass back on the street.  But yeah, we got to stay on code, but we have to make sure that there's no bullshit going on.  There's no deception going on.  Last night, my broadcast last night, they're mad because we're not driving.  Last night, when we had to clean up some shop last night, we had to clean shop up a little bit.  We had to... Okay, I'm going to have to go on live a little bit later.  The kids are mad because we stopped.  I'm still doing bug ringing.  Yeah, I'm still doing bug ringing.  Bobby Hemet, my man Bobby Hemet, I don't think he's in good health.  But, okay, let me go.  I'll go on live a little bit later.  Oh, you're looking mad.  Go to FBAC2020.com.  Go to Indiegogo.  Foundational Black American.  Also, follow my page on Instagram, my other page, KingFlexENT.

I got another bike, so I ride my bike every morning.  So that gets me right.  I can't run and get on the treadmill like I used to.  So I've been riding my damn bike all my life.  And I be feeling refreshed, sweating out all the toxins in the skin.  What's up, Zanesville, Ohio?  So let me ask the family, we're talking about doing the Foundation of Black American event, April or June?  I asked this in the chat room the other night.  Do y'all think we should do April or June?  Should we do it in April or June?  I'm thinking, do y'all think like Juneteenth around that time would be good, just for the historical significance?  What's up, T?  What you wanna do, buddy?

Sorry, guys.  We're my Atlanta people.  So we'll probably take a pop-up.  What's up, Her Majesty?  You from Atlanta?  What venue do y'all think in Atlanta will be best for the event?  Let's chop up some game.  And again, it depends on how many pre-sales we do.  That will depend on the caliber and the size of everything.  I already got a lot of people who are confirmed.  Brother James Small, he's confirmed.  Riz is confirmed.  So there's a few other people.  A few other people.  What are you looking for, Taylor?  What?  You're looking for what?  The what?

But, yeah, what venue do y'all think in Atlanta will be thorough?  WCC is a nice venue?  No.  Oh, that's cool.  For the rest of the board.  Okay.  Does anyone know Tyler Perry?  I don't know.  We gotta go to Tyler Perry.  We gotta go to Tyler Perry.  But yeah, what's... What venues... I'm trying to see what venues down there that will be real thorough, that has a nice space.  You know, I've done a lot of lectures down there.  But a lot of the lecture venues I've done, it's like... Like the last time I did a lecture down there was a real... I don't know.  Go to mommy.  Go to mommy.  Shit.  The place I did in Atlanta, it was a cool venue.  I forgot the name of it.  I forgot the name of it, but the venue was kind of, it was a little confusing, man.  It was very confusing.  A lot of people on their way there, they kind of got lost and all that.  So I don't want a venue that's going to be confusing.  Okay.  The Georgia International Convention Center by the airport.  The Cobb Center.  This dog is going to set up a feed in my apartment.  No, we're going to do this.  We're going to do this.  What happened?  Okay.  Yeah, I'm going to invite Boyce.  Boyce is my nigga.  Boyce is my dude.  So I'll probably get Boyce to come on down.  I'll probably get Boyce to come on down.  Yeah, we're doing it indoor.  Yeah, it's not going to be an outside thing.  Yeah, it's definitely going to be an indoor thing.  So I just need to find a cool venue, which shouldn't be hard.
