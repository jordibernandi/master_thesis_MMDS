            "text": "What's up guys?  What is happening?  What's going on with y'all?  What is up with y'all?  Some latex.  Do you want to be sitting down?  Yes, please, yes, let's set it up.  Yes, right there, that's good.  Yes, back over, there you go, that's good, thank you.  Yes, please, close it, please.  Yeah, I'm in the hospital right now.  What's going on, guys?  See, I'm getting a massage.  Shit, I wish.  What's up, Linus?  How are you, Jay?  What's up, Rick Carmel?  No, man, my foot is infected.  You know, I had that surgery a few weeks ago, and now my foot is real, real, real bad.  My foot looks like I'm turning into the Hulk.  Oh, man.  But shout out to everybody who is getting down with the Foundation of Black American Conference.  What's up, Tierra?  People have sent me that clip of Amanda Seals talking down on Rodney Reed.  I've told y'all about that chick, dude.  I've told y'all about that chick, dude.  Um, you know, they're going to give me some more antibiotics.  The ones that they gave me were kind of weak, so they're going to give me some more antibiotic.  And my foot looks a beast right now.  I can't, I won't even show y'all.  And again, if I show y'all my foot and I go viral, I think I'm, I'm in the movie District 9, like I'm turned into a goddamn Martian by the feet.  My foot is a beast right now.  It is.  Someone said it's the Popeye's chicken sandwich.  Say I got infected from the chicken sandwich.  My foot is doing some horrible things right now.  My foot is leaking all types of fluids.  Oh, it's a beast.  It is a beast right now, man.  And, you know, my children about to be out of school for the holidays.  I wanted to take them somewhere like Disney World or something and do shit with this damn foot.  I can't do a goddamn thing with this foot, man.  See, I got an elephant foot.  No, I ain't had no flu shot.  No, I have not had a flu shot.  No, I didn't mess with the peanut brittle.  You know, it's the gout thing.  Again, I had surgery on my foot a few weeks ago.  And it just got hella, hella infected.  Well, no, I'll be cool.  I'll be the same.  Say, holy basil will help with the pain and fast healing.  All right, here y'all go with y'all homemade medicines.  Y'all be telling me all this stuff and it'll make it worse.  What you need to do is put some peanut butter, soak that thing in some mineral water, and then put some clives on there, and then put a little paprika in there.  Then you stir it around.  Then you boil it for two days and put an egg on it.  And then you're going to wrap all that on your leg and leave it there for a whole weekend.  Y'all be telling me all types of shit.  It's a ginger ale.  No, I'll be fine.  I'll be cool.  Yeah, I'll be cool.  But yeah, nigga, my shit is a beast right now.  Yeah, it's a beast right now.  It is a monster right now.  Let me give you some cool stories about the man.  What's up, Brick of Caramel?  I see you.  Yeah, don't mind that thing back there, that thing back there beeping like I got goddamn Ebola.  Sometimes when you're in the hospital, it sounds way more serious than what it is.  When I get here, I'm looking at people, people here with all types of crazy-ass wounds.  I just saw an elderly man, his whole face was bloody.  I'm like, who hooked his ass?  I'm like, damn.  That elderly white man is about to beat the bricks off his ass.  Damn.  So I kind of feel like a punk being here by the foot.  I see some beat up elderly people up in here.  Yeah.  What about Dr.  Ali?  I like Dr.  Ali Muhammad.  I haven't heard from Dr.  Ali Muhammad for a while.  What's he up to?  Yeah.  They put my foot in a pot of grains.  But y'all need to go check out my latest episode that I did yesterday of Tariq Radio.  Go to my YouTube channel and listen to Tariq Radio.  Don't say that.  They about to cut my toe off.  They got me riding this bitch like Kunta Kinte with half a foot.  That's why I want them to get this thing right.  Yeah, man, I want them to get this right.  I'm like, shit, I couldn't hardly sleep.  My foot all janky, leaking all over the place.  So, but again, go to Tariq Radio, check out my latest broadcast.  I did last night.  Very good episode on Tariq Radio on YouTube.  And again, everybody hit up Indiegogo and participate with the Foundation of Black American Conference.  And I'll check in with y'all later.  I'll let y'all know what's going on.  Peace. ",
