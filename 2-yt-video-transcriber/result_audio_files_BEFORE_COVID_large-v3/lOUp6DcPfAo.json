He has a radio, a life raft, and a location beacon, and every reason to believe that he will be rescued.  Reslard's jet crashed midair during a refueling exercise off the coast of Japan.  Records show that Reslard and his fellow Marines were set up to fail in the weeks and months before the crash.  ProPublica conducted interviews and obtained thousands of pages of internal documents, many of them confidential, to piece together what happened.  The mission was part of a week of around-the-clock flying that would test readiness for war with North Korea.  The plan was for two F-18 Hornets to take off, refuel off a tanker in midair, and then land again.  Pilots must fly constantly to keep their skills sharp.  The minimum number of flight hours for maintaining proficiency is about 16 a month.  Squadron 242's aviators were down to about six.  Squadron Commander James Compton had been warning his superiors for months.  But nothing changed. ",

Problems were so common, the Air Force recommended that model not be fielded at all.  Captain Reslard, along with his weapons officer, Captain Austin Smith, are in the second jet, Profane 12.  Reslard wasn't ready for this mission.  His nighttime refueling qualification had expired, but because of a glitch in the Marine Corps tracking system, nobody knew. ",
