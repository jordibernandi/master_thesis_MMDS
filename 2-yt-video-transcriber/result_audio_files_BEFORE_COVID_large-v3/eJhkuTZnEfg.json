So that was a really cool thing that she did, where instead of endorsing Elizabeth Warren, who's so similar to Ariana Grande in a lot of ways, she decided to endorse Bernie Sanders.  So that's pretty cool.  Oh, she's Italian.  I forgot.  Sorry.  She's she is a POC.  Yeah. ",

What's going on in this guy's mind, okay?  Like, what's happening in this guy's mind where he's like, you know what?  I'm a f***ing stan for Katie Hill so much that, like, listen, being upset that she got f***ed over with, like, revenge porn is one thing.  But, like, this is, this is, like, white knight level, dude.  Like, what do you mean?  Oh, dude, run, queen.  Just run, queen.  You'll be the vice president.  Like, okay, dude.  All right.  Good job.  Oh, damn.  David Cross with the woke-ass take.  Yeah, no, he actually is wanting to kill himself in this circumstance because he's like, well, gun to my head, I would rather vote for Michael Bloomberg.  That's why I would rather kill myself than vote for either of these guys.  How the fuck do progressives compare Biden and Pete?  There's great comparisons between Joe Biden and Pete, except, you know, at least Joe Biden has the support of the African-American community, whereas Pete Buttigieg does not have that.  Pete Buttigieg just has, like, some progressive policies, but mostly just straight-up centrist bullshit policies, so... At least the guy who's responsible for jailing a tremendous number of African-American citizens has the support of Corn Pop.  Whereas Pete Buttigieg, I think Charles Barkley, is that the only person, is the only black person who likes Pete?  The guy who got fired from panicking at the disco for being a pedophile played guitar and did backing vocals on High Hopes.  Interesting to note.  What?  Is this real?  Investigate Mayor Pete.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's funny.  Let's not forget he's against the release of Chelsea Manning, whom you rated in her only stream.  Yeah, no, I know.  Mayor Pete has like a lot of shit.  takes, dude.  Again, anti-Chelsea Manning, anti-release of Chelsea Manning, which always get out of me.  He said that college, like free college is elitist.  Mr.  Rhodes Scholar said free college is elitist.  I thought for Libs, education was the foundation for class mobility.  I thought class mobility was feasible under capitalism, but all of a sudden... you know as soon as the liberal college uh bottom line is going to be.  uh threatened motherfucker turns around and it's like everybody turns around and they're like hey by the way college education uh that's actually elitist dude.  okay my favorite is.  but what if the billionaires kids get free college?  uh yes people do fall for that.  uh anyone who says anyone who says what if a wealthy person gets to take advantage of a universal program they're they're f***ing with you the spirit of justice.  Anyone who says, should a billionaire son go to and take advantage of college for free is a moron.  Okay.  Especially when they're trying to vilify universal programs.  That's no different than saying, should a billionaire son go to public school or should a billionaire use the public roads?  It's idiotic.  Okay.  And it's disgusting.  Anyone who says that, anyone who says some shit like that is either totally oblivious to reality or completely ate the propaganda from other liberals who know better who are fucking lying to you.  Nothing frustrates me as much as that concept.  Someone else on this platform has said that.  You probably know who.  Yeah, whoever has said that is a fucking dumbass, okay?  Whoever fucking falls for that liberal-ass propaganda hook, line, and sinker is an absolute fucking moron.  Trump talking points leaked.  Yo, this is funny as fuck.  What?  What is this, dude?  What the fuck?  What a fucking liar, dude.  What a fucking Weasley little liar, dude.  What a fucking Weasley little liar, dude.  Holy shit, dude.  The real note is even more funny.  I know, I thought it was gonna be the real note.  I was gonna make fun of him for how dumb the f***ing note is.  Dude, by the way, yeah, speaking of Andrew Yang's program, I mean, what, is a billionaire gonna get $1,000?  I'm just kidding.  Universal programs are great.  I don't have a problem with universality in programs.  I don't even have a problem with UBI.  I just don't like Andrew Yang's UBI because it's funded by a value added tax, which is a regressive tax.  And on top of that is is a replacement for people who are already on disability payment and welfare and shit like that, which is terrible.  It should be on top of that, at which point I wouldn't have an issue with it at all.  No, universal monthly income is not a dumb idea.  It's just a substitute for the actual problems that exist under capitalism.  A value added tax is a consumption tax.  So if you spend more, you spend more money.  That's wild.  I had no idea.  I didn't grow up in the first 18 years of my life in a country that has value added tax.  Thank you for describing this to me.  The whole point I'm making is that it inappropriately hurts the working poor, you morons.  And it is 100% of regressive tax.  does yang's ubi still come at the cost of social security benefits and medicare?  he says that this is a program to take people eventually off of welfare and i am genuinely afraid of something like that.  i don't think the welfare system currently as it exists is good but it is a necessity and any program that any ubi especially that uh tries to take away welfare and substitute it with like straight up money is gonna be terrible.  all right it's time for the po box for now.  all right no bombs hopefully.  Okay.  All right, let's do it.  There's a lot of big packages today.  So let's start with the gigantic one.  I know it's from, this is a good one.  This is a safe one.  Can I read this?  I don't know if I can... Is he in here?  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay, I'm gonna read it.  Hey, Ahsan.  So here's an explanation for what's in the box.  Long time fan of yours.  going back to bro tip days.  I appreciate the f*** out of you.  Find you quite inspirational even though I'm like 12 years older than you.  I'm 12 plus years active duty Navy and in the process of moving to my next duty station.  Enclosed are some trinkets.  I figured you might get a kick out of.  The ticket was a command coin from a holiday party.  The medal is my first Navy and Marine Corps achievement medal.  The vial are is... Dude, that's awesome.  Holy ****.  That's, um... That's really nice, man.  That's really nice.  Thank you.  Goddamn, dude.  I really don't deserve you guys.  I really don't.  I think these are both of the medals in the trinket.  Alright, I'm hurrying up.  I'm hurrying up.  I don't want to fuck anything up.  Chat, stop.  Still haven't cried, by the way.  For a very long time.  Okay?  Dude, I don't deserve this, man.  This is insane.  Is this it?  Is this the, uh... Oh, it is.  It's the vial as well.  So this is the hull shavings from the first hull cut made during the major overhaul done to the main while you were stationed there.  The fluid is the oil that runs throughout the boat.  And the ticket was a command coin from a holiday party, and the medal is your first Navy and Marine Corps achievement medal.  Dude, I don't deserve this, man.  This is insane.  This is it.  I'm gonna steal so much valor with this dude.  You don't even know.  This is incredible man.  And this is the party.  God damn.  That was awesome.  thank you seriously thank thank you guys.  man it's really i don't know.  it's awesome.  i really do have the best job in the world.  okay all right let's move on to the to the next uh gift to the next po box.  um i don't know who this is from.  this is a t-shirt.  What is this?  What is this, dude?  What is this, dude?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  There you go.  Look for a note?  There is no note.  Okay, well, it's from Roger Stone's store?  What?  Well, you gave money to Roger Stone, so that's why you got scammed.  He will be putting it to good use in his legal funds.  The full note said, this is from Roger Stone's exclusive collection.  I saw it on last week tonight, and I thought you would like it.  Peach heart.  Thank you, Peach.  Okay, this one's from Custom Ink.  Let's see what's in here.  There's no note.  Let's see what this is.  What?  What the f*** is this, dude?  I can never wear this.  Dude, this is like eight different inside jokes in one.  The normal people that if I ever wore this out, if I ever wore this shirt out, people would be like, people would beat my ass probably.  We're at the Twitch con saying the N word in private.  Yikes forever.  Wearing that t-shirt is worse than actually saying the N word in private.  True.  That's nuts, dude.  Jesus Christ.  Hop in the discord.  Otherwise, I'ma split you like a split cord.  My man still pausing.  Everybody is bored.  Come at me.  I'ma son you.  You'ma call me his lord. ",
