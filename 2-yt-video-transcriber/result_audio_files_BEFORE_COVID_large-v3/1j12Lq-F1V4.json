            "text": "Hey hello everybody welcome to this new video.  my name is Adam and today we're going to be talking about toxic masculinity.  and I want to talk about toxic masculinity in the trans male community.  so it's interesting because I made a video that is similar to this.  I think it was well.  it was about feminism.  okay not very similar but they have things in common.  last year I think but this year I'm coming off as new I'm further in my transition.  a lot of things changed.  I went through a lot I understood a lot of things So maybe my perspectives have changed and that's life.  So I want to talk about this topic quite from like different angles.  So the first thing I want to say is like a very weird conclusion that I quite got to.  is that toxic masculinity in the trans male community kind of makes sense.  It's not excused but... My voice, okay, it did that.  It is not excused, but you can understand it.  And I choose to understand every side of the story, even those that I don't agree with.  So, trans men, being a trans man myself, and, you know, growing up within my culture as well, like, we were quite forced to be feminine, okay?  Or we forced ourselves, even if it wasn't others, to be feminine in order to, like, be approved by our family, or by the people around us, or to just fit in.  So, femininity quite had a negative connotation to it, because of the way it was just put up on us.  So I totally understand trans men that don't like anything feminine, wouldn't want to Wouldn't feel comfortable wearing something feminine, etc, etc.  I know this will not make any sense, but I have come to analyze this and I'm like fuck.  this makes absolute sense.  So I feel like okay, I'm gonna unfilter this talk.  Okay, the trans community most of it are pretty much liberals pretty much fit in within kind of like politicizing it in a way and I kind of understand because you know, the other side of the political spectrum isn't very accepted neither.  It started off as embrace your femininity and androgyny.  And then it was like, be proud of it.  And then it was like, you kind of have to be it.  It's like, you know, if you look more androgynous, you're going to get more attention, you're going to get more recognition, respect, love, and all of that from the trans community.  I have noticed this.  Maybe it's not your experience.  Again, it's just mine.  And I know it makes absolutely no sense because You know, with cis people, it's literally the opposite.  I know that, you know, people that are more passing get more respect and are treated well.  And I can confirm this myself.  But after passing, the trans community kind of tries to kind of make it out as if you're not trans anymore.  You know, and it doesn't make sense to me.  Is being trans the process or is being trans who I am?  Or is being trans me pretty?  You know, looking very ungravenous.  It just confuses me.  It really confuses me.  With that being said, and especially with the first part that I said, it still does not excuse, you know, how toxic masculinity affects you and the people around you.  You know, if you're... Because, you know, at the end of the day, you're literally just sabotaging yourself.  You're harming yourself to begin with.  And it could come off ugly on other people, too, if they have attributes that you hate about yourself.  And I have noticed this with a lot of trans guys who deal with, you know, internalized... Transphobia or who just have toxic masculinity overall and they'd be like not taking the androgynous trans guys seriously.  So I feel like the community is like an absolute mess and like the two parts are just like No.  So we need to chill.  I can't just cure your toxic masculinity.  I try to understand it instead and know where it is coming from because it's probably coming from a dark place Especially if you're a trans man.  but you have to quite think for yourself and redefine why do you think what you think, and where does it come from, and is it actually healthy, is it a good, you know, you know, you know, you know.  I feel like I mixed up all the topics, but I'm just gonna add this.  I think it's really weird, because I feel like with cis people, I'm one thing, and with trans people, I'm another thing.  And I have noticed with the queer community, it's like, I feel like sometimes they force me to quite do feminine things.  And then when I don't enjoy it and I don't want to just because I'm not comfortable with it.  I'm not gonna hate on you for putting makeup if you're a guy.  You do you.  I mean, props to you in a world where it tells you not to.  But don't make me do it.  I don't feel comfortable myself.  And when I will feel comfortable, I will do it.  So a lot of people told me that I had toxic masculinity just because I don't feel fucking comfortable wearing a dress.  I don't feel comfortable putting on makeup.  You know what I mean?  Do I really need to explain why I don't feel comfortable doing these things?  If you're trans, you should understand that.  It blows my fucking mind how... crazy.  So I think there is, you need to make the difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity.  Okay?  There is an actual difference and It's important to separate both.  I think we should stop throwing words like, y'all, you have toxic masculinity, you're transphobic, you're racist, with people that we just don't agree on shit with.  If they're actually racist, if they're actually transphobic, then fuck them.  But, you know, you need to know what they actually are.  Not because when you don't agree on one simple idea and one simple aspect of the whole topic that it means that, you know... You know, I feel different for so many reasons, but also because I'm treated and perceived differently by the trans community.  Or at least the trans community, like, around here in North America, I guess.  Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know.  Because I have been part of, like, the trans community in Malaysia.  It was different.  There's no fucking trans community in Algeria, but, like, the LGBT community there, it's different, I feel.  I don't know.  Yeah, so feel free to comment that my struggle is not valid and because I'm a man, you know, it's meant tears and like men shouldn't complain about shit because I'm gonna flip at you in the comments because I think that is fucking stupid.  Everybody should be allowed to speak up about whatever struggle they go through.  I mean, it's just my opinion and take it to the grain of salt because I want the best for this community and I want it to be inclusive of everybody and we should not force people or tell people what to wear or what to do.  If it's their thing, if it's what they want to actually genuinely do good for them.  If they don't, then they don't.  That's the message that I'm trying to send.  You can find endless videos talking about how shitty talks of masculinity is.  So, you know, I'm not gonna add anything new to the table.  But I feel the rest of the things that I said might make you think about it from a different perspective.  Anyway, so that was it.  I'm done with this video.  Let me know what you think.  Feel free to disagree with me.  Feel free to give me your own argument and I'll listen to it gladly and I'll probably reply to you as well.  So I'll see you in another video.  Bye. ",
