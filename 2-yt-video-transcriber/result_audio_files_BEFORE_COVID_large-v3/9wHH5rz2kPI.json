            "text": "He's lived together with a girl for at least five years.  At least five years.  I don't know how long specifically, but it's been at least five years.  And they've been on and off trying to break up for the past year.  And this happened about three or four months ago, I believe.  But they finally decided, okay, to call it quits.  So she's living with him for the past.  how many years?  And of course she's not really contributing to the rent.  She's not really doing much.  Of course, right?  Freeloading off him.  And he's just doing his best, working hard.  He's living in a big city.  I'm not going to say which one.  So it's expensive.  And so they finally decide to break up after all this drama.  She takes his credit card.  and just goes on a shopping spree.  I don't know what she spends, but she spends, okay, I'm just like, every time I say this, I still can't believe it, but she spends 40K, 40,000, 40,000 bucks with his credit card.  40,000 bucks, man.  That's crazy.  Some people make that in a year.  She goes on a shopping spree.  I don't know what she's doing.  Spends $40,000 with his credit card.  And I asked him, I said, aren't you going to try to fight the charges or try to do a credit dispute?  And apparently he's just scared because he's been living with her for so long that it's almost considered a common law marriage.  so he's just like whatever 40k.  it's better than the other potential scenario right.  so lost 40k.  imagine that it's like.  it's not enough to like.  you know when people break up with each other usually they at least try to get back each other socially maybe turn a few friends against each other and stuff.  that's not enough.  yeah spend 40k of someone's money.  so i just wanted to.  I just want to bring this to you guys because, you know, this channel is talking about nuance, but we're also very rational about it.  We know certain things.  You just have to be careful when you cohabitate, when you marry or whatever.  You just have to be very careful, man.  And the laws in the West, especially in America, they're stacked against men.  There's no doubt about it.  I mean, unless you don't know how to read and you haven't ever read the laws, then maybe you don't think what I'm saying is true.  But the laws are stacked against men.  So, again, my channel is about nuance.  I'm not saying don't talk to women.  I'm not saying don't date, etc.  But you just have to be careful when committing all the way because the institution of marriage is broken.  The institution of faith is broken.  The institution of a lot of other things in America that made America great is broken.  So you can't build certain things like marriage when the fundamentals aren't there.  You see?  That's all I have to say.  Again, I'm not going to monetize this.  So you guys speak away in the comments.  I don't care.  And just speak your mind.  And for those of you who want to defend marriage or defend the girl or defend whatever, whatever, talk.  All right, guys.  Talk to you guys soon.  We will be back and have more reflections on life.
