            "text": "The more I look at this image, the gif image of Sananda and the Shroud of Turin, the more I marvel at the exact match.  The Shroud definitely looks like there is a crown of thorns.  And it seems to align exactly with Sananda's hairline.  Moving downward, you can see how the portions, you know, in the middle of the forehead and above the eyebrows and following down along the nose and under the eyes.  where the body was touching the cloth is pretty much an exact match.  If you look to the left of Sananda's nose, you can see how the cloth actually matches that exactly.  There's a little thing there.  You can see how the shape of the nose lines up exactly as well as the mustache.  Look to the lips.  They also match and as well.  In both the shroud and the Sonata photograph there you can see that the beard has a bit of a cleft in the middle.  So this is pretty amazing.  The Phoenix Journals have led us to this revelation.  The Phoenix Journals are legit.  I'm not gonna say everything in the journals are, but certainly the messages from the higher realms are the real deal.  The Phoenix Journals, number two, suggested that the Shroud of Turin was in fact authentic.  I wanted to make this video because I had a few more things to say and also I felt the way I did.  the contrast and the adjustments helped to bring out the image and you can just see like It's just such an exact match.  I mean, it's just quite something to marvel.  So, keep up your spirits.  This is amazing news.  And there's much more to come.  Thank you for listening. ",
