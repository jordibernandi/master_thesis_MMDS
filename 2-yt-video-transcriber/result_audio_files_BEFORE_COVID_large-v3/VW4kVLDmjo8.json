            "text": "The hell's going on, Americans?  Jericho Green here with you once again.  And unfortunately, yesterday, we had another mass shooting.  Also, as we all know, last weekend, there was a mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival.  Fortunately, there was a very low number of people killed.  Even better than that, the shooter was killed on sight.  Unfortunately, yesterday there were a lot of people killed.  I've heard as many as 26.  Also, unfortunately, the shooter was taken into custody safely.  Personally, I think they should drag him face down over glass for a mile.  Skin and boil this piece of shit.  Some people are damaged.  Some people just came out wrong.  You cannot fix them.  You can't understand them.  You can't rehabilitate them.  They need to be destroyed like a rabid dog.  We need to have the old yeller bill where mass shooters get put down like rabid fucking dogs.  Now, even though it seems that we have mass shootings in this country frequently... If you really think about it, they're not that frequent.  And contrary to popular belief, America is not even in the top 10 for mass shootings.  Yes, that's right.  America, despite our size, is not even in the top 10 for mass shootings.  Some guy came out with a report during the Obama administration.  I think he took records from the 90s all the way to 2010.  But the information, the pool of information he drew from was very limited and very small.  He left out a lot of different factors.  Really, the top countries for mass shootings are all like Norway, Sweden, Russia's in there.  They're not even close to us.  We're not even close when it comes to Topp.  countries from mass shootings.  America is the safest country in the world.  New York City is the safest city in the world, despite the rodents, the piss smell in the subway, and Mayor de Blasio and Rocco Cortez.  Despite all those disgusting things, New York City is the safest city, safest big city in the world.  Now, I don't usually talk about mass shootings.  I think this is only the third time out of the hundreds of videos I've done where I actually talk about it.  Last week's shooting, obviously very close to home, literally.  But what caught my eye and what made me want to talk about this was the reaction from two of the 2020 clown candidates.  Beto O'Rourke, and he's from El Paso, where it happened, so of course he's going to have something to say about it.  That makes sense.  And then Amy Klabacher, Klubbanger, whatever her name is.  Who gives a shit?  She's a nobody.  Next round of debates, that bitch won't even be there.  But they, of course, could not let an opportunity to politicize a tragedy and blame Trump go unused.  Amy whatever her name is, she got on there saying that Trump's rhetoric, he's created a racist environment in this country and that's the reason we have shootings like this.  Blaming Trump for this shit.  Trump supporter or not, the president has nothing to do with this sick shit.  Nothing.  Beto O'Rourke.  Oh, the president's racist and his rhetoric.  Look, no one's rhetoric has an effect on a normal person.  Trump can get on TV right now and say, everybody, you need to go out and do A. And if it's not conducive to my health or prosperity, I'm not fucking doing it.  Dog whistles and rhetoric, these words they use are bullshit.  These are, I don't even want to call them crazy people because that's an insult to crazy people.  These are disgusting animals and they're evil.  You can't stop that.  We can't legislate our way out of these things happening.  So, of course, they use these opportunities to do what?  Gun control.  That's right.  Comprehensive gun control.  What the fuck does that mean?  That means give me your shit.  Give me your weapons.  You're easier to control without them.  They asked the Japanese emperor during World War II, how come you don't invade mainland America?  He said, because there's a gun behind every blade of grass.  Meaning we can't, too many American citizens are armed, we'll get fucked up.  And you would, Japanese emperor.  That's why we have the Second Amendment to have our guns.  And people think, yeah, but back then they were worried about the government tyranny.  Yeah, so are we.  What do you think they're trying to do?  You think if they take our guns that all their security are going to give up their guns too to show solidarity with us?  No.  We're going to be unarmed.  They're going to be armed.  They're going to be in control.  Well, this shit can't happen.  Yes, it can.  Ask Venezuela.  Before you can corrupt a government like that, before you can throw an entire population of people into abject fucking poverty, you have to take their means to protect themselves against you.  And that's what they did.  Look at Australia.  Crikey.  Look at the size of that picket on that crocodile.  I just wanted a reason to do that.  But look at Australia, their voluntary gun buyback program.  What, like 2% of people did that shit?  This is the beginning of, I hate to sound like a foil-hatted conspiracy theorist, but this is how they're going to do it.  They're going to say, look, people are dangerous with guns.  Look at all these mass shootings.  We need your guns.  Assault weapons ban.  What the fuck is that?  I can take a spork and make that an assault weapon.  We gonna ban those too?  Hey, California heard that and say, hold my beer.  We'll ban that shit.  What's an assault weapons ban?  Anything can be used as an assault weapon.  If you use it to assault, it becomes an assault weapon.  Now, I know AR-15s look cool and scary with all their railing systems and cool stocks and they're black.  But it's the same as a damn Winchester hunting rifle.  Same thing.  But they have the nerve to politicize this.  It's Trump's fault.  His rhetoric made this happen.  White supremacy.  Shut the fuck up.  These people are disgusting and damaged and they're going to do these things regardless.  We can take all guns.  London.  Knife attacks are through the roof.  What about New York where the guy took that truck and ran down eight bikers on that bike path?  People are going to carry out their evil plans regardless.  What we need is to be armed.  We need to arm ourselves.  We're the biggest force.  That's why we're squeezing the hardest on taxes because we're the biggest group.  They can get the most money from us.  We need to arm ourselves.  I'm honestly looking in to getting a concealed carry permit.  Now, the sheriff in the county I live in is actually pretty loose with him.  So I need to get in while I can.  I need to get in where I fit in, strike while the iron's hot, and get a CCW.  Now, to any normal, average, everyday person... Man, you don't want to have to use your gun on someone.  You don't want to have to shoot or kill anybody.  But I certainly don't want to be out at the mall with my family shopping and someone starts shooting.  These fucking cowards.  I don't want to be at a festival and someone starts shooting.  And you heard Ilhan the double Somali agent Omar last week.  I posted a video of her saying that white men are the number one terrorist threat in America.  Really?  Because if you look at the top three mass shootings of all time, I think it's two to one colors to white.  Now, we're talking just shootings, not terrorism, because that goes to the Muslims by far, 9-11.  But if you're just talking shootings, number one is the Vegas shooter.  That was an old white guy who didn't support Trump, by the way.  Number two is the Pulse nightclub, Muslim.  And number three, I believe, is the Virginia Tech shooting.  That was an Asian guy.  So two to one POCs to whites.  So take that and shove it up your disgusting ass, Ilmar.  Ilhan.  Ilmar.  Yeah.  Ilhan Omar together.  Ilmar.  That's what I'm going to call her ass.  Fucking Ilmar.  Shove that up your ass, Ilmar.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  And I really believe that mass shootings, just like, you know, you got people, I don't want to say my kids, there's too many perverts out there, perverts.  There's always been perverts.  But now, with the internet, social media, we hear about everything.  So if there's a mass shooting in the small town of El Paso, Texas, we all hear about it.  There have been mass shootings forever.  The other guy in the early 60s on the University of Texas campus, he got up in that clock tower.  Was picking people off with his assault rifle.  Then you had a guy in the 80s at a Burger King restaurant.  He used his assault rifle.  Right?  And then the Columbines and all that shit.  Columbine was 20 years ago.  This shit's been going on for a long time.  This isn't new.  This isn't because of Trump.  That's a fucking lie.  And that's disgusting of those two to politicize this and try to gain some ground in their presidential race, which is a fucking dream.  Neither one of you assholes are going to be president.  Beta O'Rourke and Kim, whatever the hell your stupid ass name is, that's disgusting.  But mass shootings are nothing new.  We just hear about them with more regularity because we're all connected.  That's why.  But looking up, don't just take my word for it.  America is not even close to being number one in mass shootings in the world.  Not even close.  Don't believe the hype.  But hopefully, since this piece of rotten shit decided to pull off his crime in Texas, hopefully Texas shows some of that good old-fashioned Lone Star State punishment and his ass gets put in the electric chair.  What happened to the gas chamber?  Maybe if we had more strict punishments and stopped saying these clowns' names, because that's what they want is the fame.  Maybe if we had stricter punishments, these fools wouldn't do that.  But maybe I'm wrong.  We are talking about sick, disgusting, evil people.  So maybe it wouldn't curtail the crimes, but it is what they deserve.  They deserve stiffer punishments.  Hangings, electric chair, gas chamber.  None of this needle in the arm, and I fall softly to sleep, never to wake again.  Fuck that.  You think those people that got shot in the mall just got shot and then fell asleep peacefully?  No.  There was anguish and pain and screaming and crying.  They need to feel the same.  How are you going to say the way you execute a monster is inhumane?  What did they do to get in the position to be executed?  It was probably pretty inhumane.  So they deserve the same or worse.  Even better, get the families of the victims together.  Let them take care of them.  Let the fathers of these dead children take care of them.  And you know what?  Let Mama Bear get in there too.  Because Mama Bear can fuck some shit up.  They'll probably pull some fried green tomatoes on them.  Remember that movie?  That girl was abused.  Her homies got together and they killed his ass and served him in a restaurant.  Sounds good to me.  Now, let's end this on a high note.  It is my Friday, so let me finish up this damn rat race.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.  Please subscribe, hit that notification bell, utilize the PayPal link and the Teespring link to get your green gear.  I am Jericho Green.
