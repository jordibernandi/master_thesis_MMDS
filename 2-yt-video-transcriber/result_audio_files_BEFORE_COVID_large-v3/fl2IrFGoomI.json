I'll drop a link in the chat, but of course you can go to knowwhiteguilt.org.  I've got a poster on my wall behind me.  As I say, it's just a novella.  It's not a very long read, but we laugh here in the white positive sphere as well.  A lot of dire things to talk about, but we have a lot of fun as well.  We create a lot of art. ",
