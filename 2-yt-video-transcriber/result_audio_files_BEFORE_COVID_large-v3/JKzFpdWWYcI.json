            "text": "What's up, y'all?  How y'all doing?  Hope you're doing alright.  I'll be honest with you, I'm dealing with a little anxiety today on account of the Democratic primaries are on my mind.  I ain't gonna lie, I'm nervous about it.  At first, I was like, at least I live in California, you know, I can use some of this legal weed to treat this anxiety.  But then, I remembered the last time I had one of these weed gummies out here, I became utterly convinced that an earthquake was coming because I heard birds squawking at nighttime.  So... I did, man.  I was just panicking in my wife's face like, I'm telling you, honey, they know about this shit before we do.  Now help me with this mattress.  I'm so thirsty and afraid.  But anyway, I'm worried about how the primaries are going to go.  And as some of you might have guessed, the reason it's on my mind is because this morning, Bernie announced his candidacy in 2020.  Now look, let me preface this by saying I love Bernie.  I think he did great shit for the left, how I voted for him.  But he also was part of a real eye-opening experience for me last time.  So in 2016, a bunch of people on my page got furious at me, a loud and proud liberal, because I had the audacity to refer to Bernie Sanders as a, quote, soup-eating motherfucker.  Now, okay, first of all, take a good look at Bernie Sanders.  Search your heart and soul and tell me right now that that ain't the soup-eatingest motherfucker you've ever seen in your life.  Dude, he's 75% soup.  He's all about something.  Dude, fucking eating soup and making promises, that's what he do.  And act like Bernie Sanders.  Are you out of your mind?  Anyway, more importantly, it doesn't matter.  I'm a comedian, and I'm a soup-eating motherfucker.  I love soup.  Who doesn't?  It's soup.  It's not offensive to say that about a person.  But I got raked over the coals for it by other liberals, and that's when it occurred to me.  We don't stick together the way they do on the other side.  We just don't, man.  I mean, you say what you will about them on the other side, and Lord knows I've said plenty, okay?  And they may squabble about an issue here or a mass shooting there, but at the end of the day, they know what they like, and what they like ain't brown, okay?  They walk the line, man, in a way that we just don't.  And that's why I'm so nervous about this shit right now.  Because I'm not saying it's going to be Bernie.  I don't know what's going to happen.  But somebody, some of us, our candidate, ain't going to be the one, y'all.  That's just the way it goes.  But no matter what, we know right now, whoever wins on our side, we know who's going to be on the other side.  And that's the only thing that matters.  That's what I'm saying.  To me, it's like this.  If you took your kid and you told him, all right, look, honey, you can either eat this plate of vegetables, that me and your mom and your teachers and the rest of us picked out for you.  We know you're not crazy about them, okay?  But you can either eat this or this old moldy bag of circus peanuts covered in hair that was selected by our neighbors who hate science.  What's it gonna be?  At first, the kid's gonna be like, oh, but I don't, I don't want that.  I wanted the carrot cake.  Yeah, no, look, we thought the carrot cake sounded good, but long term, it just wasn't the right choice, okay?  So anyway, vegetables or fluffy orange poison.  Oh, also, the circus peanuts are racist, so.  Look, that shit's silly, but to me, it really is that simple, okay?  Because even though we haven't made our choice yet, the choice is already clear.  And we all know it.  So no matter how divisive and contentious this whole primary process gets, and it may need to for us to find the right person for the job, just keep two things in mind, okay?  Number one, ultimately, we're all on the same team here.  And number two, the other team wants to kill us all with hairy, racist clown food.  Love y'all.  Come see me on the road. ",
