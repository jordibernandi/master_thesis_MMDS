            "text": "to the Centre for Inquiry.  This April, Brunei introduced a revised Sharia-based Penal Code.  Instead of removing sanctions against actions which should not be treated as crimes, the country has tightened its human rights-violating legislation.  Brunei remains one of over just two dozen countries penalising apostasy.  Furthermore, its blasphemy legislation punishes peaceful criticism of religious ideas and outlaws all publications considered to be contrary to state-recognized religious laws.  These anti-modern laws clearly discriminate against atheists and other non-religious people and suppress individual freedoms.  At the same time, the Brunei Investment Agency and the country's absolute monarch invest heavily in high-tech enterprises all over the world.  It is time that Brunei catapults itself into modernity, also with regards to valuing human rights and guarantees its people freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief.  Thank you. ",
