OTAs begin this week, and the first practice will be open to the media on Tuesday.  And Ryan put out... Monday, eight big questions that are facing the Bills heading into OTAs.  I put some of the top position battles and we thought, let's connect, talk about some of the things we're looking forward to in OTAs as we progress through this offseason in anticipation for the 2019 NFL season.  And Ryan, first and foremost, I think that it all comes back to Josh Allen.  We talked about it over and over again throughout the off season, you know, Brandon being putting pieces around Josh Allen.  And this is going to be the first look that we get at Josh Allen with all of these new toys. ",

Obviously the wide receivers that they added, John Brown, a guy that can provide that speed on the outside across from Robert Foster, Cole Beasley in the slot, maybe even Andre Robertson in a smaller role in the receiving game, more so special teams there.  Duke Williams, a guy that I think a lot of fans are interested to see what he can do just because The Bills are very aggressive to add him early in free agency, the top CFL wide receiver in 2018.  And that also leads to the offensive line and the guys that are going to be protecting him this season and then. ",

Foster and Zay Jones, Isaiah McKenzie, who's going to be battling for a position or for a roster spot in camp.  And some of these some of these names at the bottom of the wide receiver depth chart, you're not right.  Probably aren't getting too many headlines right now, but you look at a guy like Cam Phillips, who at times really impressed in preseason training camp last year.  He's obviously made it to a second go-around with the Bills, and there's not a lot of wiggle room, but some of these lower caliber names are people... and players to keep an eye on.  And then you look at the tight end position in particular, obviously a whole new group aside from Jason Kroon in the room with Josh Allen.  And, you know, it's going to be interesting to chronicle how the, you know, progressions are made specifically with the rookies, Tommy Sweeney, 7th round, and... This marquee draft pick, trading back up into the third to get Dawson Knox.  I think it's going to be interesting to see how they're all utilized and how they all assimilate into the Bills system.  That's one thing that Sean McDermott has been talking about for the past few weeks.  is it's now on him.  He's going to take the reins from Brandon Bean and try to meld everything together on the offensive side.  Obviously, Brian Dable is going to have a big piece in that. ",

You think based on the contract that just gave Lee Smith, he's going to be there.  blocking tight end.  and obviously tyler croft was a guy that they signed early in free agency to a sizable deal.  so there's three right there.  and then like you said is it going to be tommy sweeney?  is it going to be jason croon?  will they even carry four tight ends?  so very little wiggle room there.  and this is their first chance for some of these players to kind of uh show show the team what they can do and show that they belong on this roster.

They've said it a few times, so I anticipate seeing him there.  as the day one starter.  But then it gets very interesting because you have so many different elements in play.  You have a swing tackle, Ty Insecchi, who was paid a considerable amount of money for a guy that's been, for the majority of his career, a backup in the NFL.  And then you have second-round draft pick Cody Ford, who Brandon Bede came out and, you know, said that the team sees him as a right tackle.  And, you know, you spend a draft pick on a guy like that, and you hope that he's a contributor from day one.  And I think that, you know, if Deion Dawkins is on the left and Cody Ford is on the right, it's very interesting to see what they're going to do with Ty Insecchi because I think a lot of people believe whichever side he ends up on, he's going to be a starter on this team.

If he struggles in training camp, if he struggles this summer, maybe they do say, well, listen, you know, Ty Insecchi has had some experience at left tackle at Washington.  Let's try him out there.

So two players that have a connection to the new offensive line coach, two guys that aren't really being talked about necessarily as starters, but maybe it could be key depth.  Maybe they could surprise and compete for those spots.  You know, Spencer long and Quentin Spain seem to be getting the most talk in terms of being the potential starters at a guard, but again, It's just so much unknown at this point in the year that I think fans are going to be excited to see how all things shake out between now and September.

And Rafael Bush, who was able to kind of pop in there and... help out when Taron Johnson's not healthy.  but then you Brandon Bean goes out and he adds two veteran cornerbacks EJ Gaines obviously a guy that's done it in this system.  Kevin Johnson a former first round pick and I think that position battle for that number two spot opposite Tredavious White all of a sudden became becomes one of the more hotly contested ones in camp.

I think that he showed over those last seven games that he belonged, that he could hold his own because he was tested.  It's not like the opposing quarterbacks didn't throw at him.  Maybe he didn't have the interceptions.  He had a few opportunities that he should have come up with a few last year.  that were knocked away last second, things like that, that he kind of lost in fights.  But I think the Bills would prefer to have a youthful player there like that, someone that already has a year experience in their system.  But EJ Gaines was here in 2017, and when he was healthy, That defense was clicking on all cylinders, and I believe they were holding opposing offenses to something like 16, 17 points a game.  Now, mind you, he was not healthy all of 2017.  He missed some time.  He obviously missed a lot of time last year in Cleveland with concussion issues.  So injuries are definitely something that have hampered his career, that have followed him throughout his career.  So, you know, maybe he ends up winning that job, but I think maybe the best thing for him in Buffalo would be \u2013 spelling uh levi wallace at times during games coming in for a few snaps here and there where maybe he doesn't have as many snaps as he would be accustomed to if he was starting but he would still be a viable outside contributor at cornerback.  and then like you said a guy like kevin johnson Here's a player that has experience with John Butler, the new defensive backs coach.  He has the versatility to play on the inside or outside, so maybe the Bills give him a look at number two cornerback, but maybe he ends up competing with Taron Johnson for the slot cornerback position because Johnson only has one year under his belt, Taron Johnson that is, but he also had some injury issues throughout his rookie year with his shoulder, and that hampered him.

I just feel like he was a guy that was flying around the field.  Anytime that you saw a play, he was somewhere in that screenshot.  He was seldom out of place last year.  You know, and it's unfortunate he went down in that game against the Jets so late in the season and ended up with the fractured and dislocated ankle.  But like you said, he's on schedule to return.  He's a guy that I think his play will be critical to the success of Buffalo's defense this year because you have these two young linebackers in Milano and Tremaine Edmonds.  And both guys, as the season went on, just kept getting better and better.  Edmonds especially because he made a lot of rookie mistakes earlier.  early in the year, was out of plays, was a little hesitant at times.  But you have two guys that could be, you know, cornerstones to this defense.  And then obviously you have the Wiley veteran and Lorenzo Alexander.  So that linebacker unit is going to play a pivotal role in terms of the run defense.  You know, if you have guys like Starla Tulalay who are going to take on extra blockers, or extra linemen, I should say, to help clean things up for those linebackers, make life easier for them.  You add an Ed Oliver in there that can create a pass rush that can stop the run.  And I think on paper, this defense could end up being, again, a top five unit in 2019. ",

            "text": "Mm hmm.  With Josh Allen, one of the things that I was really interested to watch back at rookie minicamp was our first look at, you know, new positional coaches, you know, Bobby Johnson, quarterbacks coach.  Ken Dorsey, and I think that that's going to be continuing to be a storyline as we head into these last six to eight weeks before training camp, is Derek Anderson is now out of the picture.  He's decided to step away and retire.  And one of the question marks that comes with his removal from that quarterback's room is who is going to step up into that leadership role?  And, you know... by most accounts, Matt Barkley should be up to the challenge.  I think that him and Josh Allen are very close.  And I think that that's something that's a relationship that's really helped him last season in addition to Derek Anderson.  But I'm also going to be very interested to see how Ken Dorsey assimilates himself into the culture under Sean McDermott, Brian Dable, how he works with the quarterbacks, what's his demeanor like, what's the dynamic between him and all the quarterbacks.  When I was watching him with Tyree on minicamp and That must have been one of his very first interactions with Tyree, I would imagine.  He was very subdued, very kind of just taking it all in.  And as things go along, it's going to be interesting to see if he gets a little bit more involved, a little bit more energetic, and what kind of dynamic he has with Josh.  Because you think back to last season with Dave Cauley, and I thought at times, you know, along with Juan Castillo, not that they were bad coaches by any stretch.  I don't... not going to sit here and pretend that I'm able to evaluate that, but just watching practice and just seeing the way that different coaches interact with players and you could see you know Brian Dable is always around talking to guys whether it be the quarterbacks whether it be receivers tight ends wherever offensive linemen he's engaged he's talking to him.  I thought Bobby Johnson was another guy that really seemed to bring an energy to practice and I think that that's something that Josh Allen feeds off of.  I think he wants people around him.  Derek Anderson was always kind of joking around with him during the stretches and making things fun for him.  And I think that that's something that Ken Dorsey, a guy that supposedly had a lot of success and was responsible for a lot of the success of Cam Newton early on, I'm very interested to see that dynamic.

There's no doubt in my mind that when Brendan Bean drafted Josh Allen, he saw a lot of Cam Newton in Josh Allen in terms of the athleticism, the arm strength, the mobility, etc.  And I think that he knows the success that Ken Dorsey had with Cam Newton in Carolina.  To this day, Cam Newton has nothing but positive things to say about his experiences with Ken Dorsey and how much he helped him.  So I think it's going to be very similar in terms of, you know, Brendan Bean, Sean McDermott are going to say, listen, just like you were there for Cam Newton, we want you to be there for Josh Allen.  We want you to coach him up.  We want you to talk to him about, you know, okay, you don't always have to throw that to 20 yard ball down the field.  sometimes it's okay to take those 5 or 6 yard passes to Cole Beasley or Zay Jones or whomever the case may be you know.  so talk him up or coach him up in terms of what he should be seeing and what he should be doing on the field but also work with him the same way he worked with Cam Newton because those two had a great relationship still seem like they're close with one another and I'm sure that played a big role in why Buffalo ",

And you know, so much when, when you build things up to the level that they were at going into the end of the season, then looking ahead to next season, you know, the pressure was on and Brandon Bean has delivered, but now it's transitioning.  Like I mentioned earlier to the part of the process where these guys got to come together and you're going to start to see individuals and how they fit into this room.  You know, it, It's something that with all the new faces, it's probably not been discussed a lot at this point yet, but there's a big dynamic shift in that room with Kyle Williams gone and Josh Allen assuming more of a leadership role.  Frank Gore now in the running backs room assuming a lot of the leadership as well.  So I think it's going to be very interesting to see which personalities kind of Rise to the top.
