            "text": "Hello there everybody, Peter of England here bringing you a short video today on quite an interesting topic.  I apologize for the shadowing on the camera but I'm filming this while I'm on the road so I thought it better to sacrifice the visual quality rather than not get the message out.  The message is quite an interesting one as well for all those gilets jaunes in the United Kingdom and for all those people watching this video from afar.  It's concerning the constitution of the United Kingdom, the monarchy and major political players.  What we see in the newspaper yesterday is a very interesting article.  It was in the Daily Telegraph today, I don't know if you can see that part of that headline, but for those who can't see it, it says, plan to save the Queen in case of no-deal riots in the United Kingdom.  There was also an article on Apple News that appeared early in the morning, that's from going Sunday into Monday just, which basically says there is a plan to exit to a safe country or safe haven the British monarchy in case of a no-deal Brexit series or sequence of riots in London.  Now, it's very, very interesting that that's being mooted because there are rumors in the background that the royal family are abdicating or have been given an ultimatum by various other, should we say, white hat forces in the global political world.  that their time is up and it's time for them to go.  So don't forget that during the First World War, during the Second World War, the British monarchy sat there on their thrones like ticks on a dog, and it's a basic tenet or proposition of monarchical rule that the moment that the monarch or any leader actually quits his palace or his, shall we say, his lex terrae, his home ground, that the deal or the game is up.  So what this in effect would mean is if the royal family or the queen in particular decides to quit the throne to leave England to escape for any reason that is inherently an abdication of the throne and the crown.  and what my personal perspective on this is For all those out there who have campaigned against the monarchy, who have campaigned for electoral reform and a political type of parliamentary reform, what's happening here, I think, is a very, very gentle gift being put on a plate and offered to your very hands.  Because I think what's being said here, reading between the lines, is if now... is a time to move, then there has never been a better time to move.  So with this type of politicisation and, should we say, a wrap of the Brexit confrontation or Brexit problem, are being pointed at the hands of what's called the Brexiteers, we could end up in a situation where what I actually think is maybe the monarchy are creating their own backdoor, their own escape run or rat run to get them out of the country and to get them installed in some other country, possibly Canada, we hear possibly Australia, because as this global Zionist cabal this international stock market capitalist banking cartel begins to crack, then there is obviously safe havens required for the rats that will desert the ship.  So let's see how this plays out.  I thought I would mention it and put it into the video because particularly the people who are watching these videos in the United States and further afield possibly don't obviously see some of these things that appear in the local press and in the local media.  So that's the message to you.  There is another video coming up after this where I'm going to deal with some other quite what I think are very, very important topics, particularly important to those people in the United States.  And what I think is a increasing upsurge of potential massive economic reform projects.  worldwide.  I don't like to use the word globally I prefer to say worldwide because this could tie in with the talk of an economic jubilee or a reset and I know people have been hearing this for many many years and it's been talked left and right and up and down and it's had all the goodness chewed out of it.  but there is a possibility however remote that one day it could happen and and without hope we have nothing.  So please watch that.  That's a follow-on video.

So thank you very much for listening.  Keep your ear to the ground on these points and I'll be posting more videos soon.  Thank you very much. ",
