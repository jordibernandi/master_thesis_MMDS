I think you might be familiar with it, but just for everyone here, it's just a good way to have a conversation with people you help release without making the conversation turn into an argument, fist fight, or debate, making your side defensive.  I normally never get the chance to speak to open atheists, and so what I hope to do is be able to talk about you about some of the questions that theists might have with regard to, you know, your perspective, where do you get your morals from, what do you think is going to happen to you after you die, and basically how you became an atheist and how you got corrupted.  I'm an atheist myself, but I'm just wondering, like, from the perspective of a theist, why do you think atheism is a more reasonable position than theism? ",

So, I mean, somebody will tell me something that maybe that happened, maybe it's possible.  I will entertain that possibility, but I try not to be convinced.  There have been situations where I have enough information that I'm overwhelmingly convinced, and it's possible even then, in some instances, to change my mind and say, no, you drew a lot of conclusions for the information that you have, but it was faulty because of these reasons, and then I have to change my mind.  Or you were misinformed, or what have you.  Or it was photoshopped, you know, whatever.  So the idea is that we don't want to be fooled into believing something.  People will always bring up Psalm 14 to talk about how the Bible described atheists as a fool.

This is how we ended up where we are.  We already lost, as a species, our massive musculature that the other apes had before.  we had large brains.  So the only advantage we had for a time was our camaraderie as a society, where instead of, as herd animals often do, you leave the slow one behind and everybody else escapes, we would have a child left alone and the entire tribe goes to defend it against the cat or whatever it was that was coming to threaten it.

Well, that's, again, you've made it so ambiguous that everything is God and thus nothing is God.  So if you're going to be talking about what is a god, then you've got to conclude that your definition has to include all of the gods, the hundreds of gods that were worshipped by thousands of people for thousands of years, or millions of people for thousands of years.  So if it doesn't apply to Odin or to Hera, then that definition doesn't work.  So for me, I've concluded that a god is a magical anthropomorphic immortal.  Okay, okay.  Magical meaning miraculous, which again is impossible by definition.  Miracle and magic have the same definition.  They're the evocation of supernatural forces or entities to control or forecast natural events in ways which are inexplicable by science because they defy the laws of physics, which makes them physically impossible by definition.  Okay.  Likewise, it is impossible for God to exist as a disembodied mind absent the brain that created it, because a mind, by definition, is the data that is produced by a brain.
