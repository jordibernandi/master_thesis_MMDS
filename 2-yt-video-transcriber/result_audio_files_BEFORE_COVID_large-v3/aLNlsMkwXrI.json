            "text": "Is there a 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar with a blob mint mark worth a bunch of money?  Watch this video to find out.  Before we get started, I want everyone to come over here to coinzip.com and you can look at all the coin shows from state to state for 2020.  I also want to remind everyone that I will be doing a live video Monday night at 7 p.m.  Eastern Time with Robert Lawson of Coin Op.  So I did a search for a 1979 Susan Anthony dollar with a blob mint mark.  And obviously what happened was this.  Several Etsy ads showing this coin for upwards of $50,000.  That's what came up in my search.  And people have been asking me if those are rare.  It does.  It says, look, it has a blob instead of a mint mark, making it very rare.  Now you tell me.  Now I look for videos, I look for articles online, I didn't see anything about a blob mint mark.  This does hurt coin collecting.  This makes things a headache.  When someone has this up and it comes up first in a search result and it has blob mint mark in there, this really does hurt.  It's not worth this much.  So we're going to look at some Susan B. Anthony dollars.  They were actually high mintage.  And they had a P, a D, and an S. This is the first coin since 1940s war nickels that a coin had a P mint mark on it from the Philadelphia Mint.  So it has the D. And we can look at the D. And these mint marks aren't that good.  They're not very well defined.  You also have the P mint mark.  It's a little better defined.  And then you have the S. This is a normal S. All of them look like this on the business strikes.  There's not anything different about it.  Yeah, it looks like a blob, but that's normal.  If every one of them have it, it doesn't make it rare.  But there is one thing that you can look for.  And we're going to get to that in a minute.  What I want to show you here is all these values are for coins that graded 68.  Mid-state 68.  Here's another one.  Mid-state 67.  This was the wide rim.  If you don't know what a wide rim is, what you're looking for here, click on it, is there's hardly a space here.  You can compare your 79s to the 80 and 81 to see if you have the wide rim.  Because 79 is not supposed to look like this.  Now they're not as rare in the lower grades, but since this grade is 67, it went for $1,500 plus.  Same with this one.  You're looking at a mint state 68 coin, graded by NGC.  That's the reason it sold for that much, not because it had a blob mint mark.  Now there is something you want to look for, and that's this.  Here's the blob mint mark on a proof.  And proofs came in a set like this.  So there is what they call a clear S and a proof set.  A deep cameo coin, it's not a business strike like this one.  It's much different.  And see the difference.  This is a business strike.  This is your proof.  Okay, and it must come in a set like this.  It must have the deep cameo on it.  Yes, it can be found in circulation.  It's possible.  Someone might have broke it open and spin it or whatever.  But it still must be a proof.  And you'll be able to see the reflectivity in the fields.  But this mint mark is a blob mint mark.  That's the way they are.  They're normal.  This is what you want.  It's still not worth a bunch of money.  I mean, it's worth a few dollars in the proof.  So I wanted to show you that so you know that the blob mint mark does not add value at all to the Susan B. Anthony dollars.  Thanks for watching my latest video.  Please like, share, comment, subscribe and have a great day. ",
