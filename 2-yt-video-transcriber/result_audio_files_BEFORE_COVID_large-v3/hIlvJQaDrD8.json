            "text": "Look, there's the Black Holocaust.  I knew it was prophecy.  A thousand times worse than the Jewish atrocities.  Uneven playing field, there'll never be a fair score.  Cause in 1619, that's when they declared war.  We the 12 tribes, the ones that the promise reaches.  As far as what?  As far as some of y'all beliefs.  Some particulates, right?  I have nothing against Hispanic Mexican guys.  I have no problem with that.  But what?  But I don't see that they fall under any curses.  They know they got businesses.  They striving.  I do construction.  I can't do construction no more because they got all the jobs.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  We were just talking about this.  He said he's under the curses because he was doing construction.  Now he can't do it, but we showed him a black man.  You said you got a construction company, but now you can't because they got the job.  This is what I'm saying, bro.  That's exactly what you just said.  I have no problem with these people, but they don't seem to fall under any curses.  From what I can see, because they got their own country.  They got Mexico.  They over here.  You got America.  They striving.  They are living very, they living good.  Wait, wait, wait.  They got businesses.  Hold on, brother.  Let me tell you something.  This is a fact.  They got businesses.  They got all the jobs.  We can't even get no jobs.  Who has the highest poverty rate in America?  Now, my question is... Say it, brother.  I ain't never seen that.  I don't know.  Brother, who's the highest incarcerated?  Brother, who's the highest incarcerated in America?  Those Afro-Mexicans over there that they keep secluded.  I just told you, bro.  I just said this to you, bro.  Those Afro-Mexicans over there that they keep secluded in certain areas of Mexico.  They are not allowed to leave those areas or they could be tortured, even killed.  Where do you get this information, sir?  They're called Afro-Mexicans.  They look like us.  They speak Spanish.  They got nappy hair.  Hold on.  that look just like you and have straight hair.  So my question to you is what are them?  Some Afro-Mexicans over there, what are them?  They're Israelites.  Come on, what are you, what porn are you making, man?  Okay, I'm glad you said that.  But what I'm saying is this.  Because I believe that too.  But hold on, but wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're saying that you don't, hold on, you're saying that you don't feel like a brother like this?  Those straight hair, those straight hair ones, With that, you got the same characteristics of a Gentile, of an Edomite with that straight hair, man.  Give me Solomon Ford.  With that straight hair, with the same characteristics as an Edomite with that straight hair, bro.  Okay, brother, I'm going to tell you something.  Can an Israelite have straight hair?  I don't believe so.  Going to the Bible.  I'm going to show you real quick, all right?  So that way you can kind of re-examine and re-format how you're thinking.  Because all we got is the Bible, right?  So let's go with the Bible.  Give me Psalms of Solomon 4, whoever got it first.  It's right after Proverbs.  Psalms of Solomon 4 and 1.  I got you.  Because Jacob had 12 wives.  12 wives.  And all wives were Hebrew Israelites.  They were women of color.  All 12 of them.  They were Hebrew Israelites.  How you going to tell me?  Jacob was Israel.  His wives weren't Hebrew Israelites.  So they were Gentiles.  Non-Israelite, yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  So our forefathers weren't Hebrew Israelites.  They were Syrian or Hamlet, right?  So I'm going to show you something real quick.  Solomon chapter 4 verse 12.  Uh-huh.  A garden enclosed is my sister.  No, verse 1.  Verse 1.  Uh-huh.  Behold, thou art fair, my love.  Behold, thou art fair.  Thou hast dove eyes.  So Solomon is saying his wife is fair, beautiful, have dove eyes, right?  Go ahead.  Within thy looks.  Uh-huh.  Thy hair is as a flock of goats.  Her hair is as a flock of goats.  What type of hair goats have?  They got that curly shit like on.  That's sheep.  That's sheep.  That's wool shit.  Somebody get goat.  Somebody pull up goat hair.  Somebody pull up goat hair real quick.  Read that.  No, you're doing too much.  Let's get, pull up goat hair.  They don't fit the curses though, man.  I'm showing you right now.  Why they got businesses and stuff?  Have you heard of Magic Johnson?  got businesses?  Yeah.  Have you heard of Black Wall Street?  Right.  Yeah.  They have businesses.  Have you seen any of the businesses in Atlanta?  That goat hair.  That's a goat.  That's goat hair.  So you need to tell me niggas got hair like that?  Hey, you better come to Sakari, man.  They don't put the curses, man.  They don't put the curses.  Afro-Mexicans over there in Mexico.  You've been locked up?  The Afro-Mexicans.  that's over in Mexico, I believe them is.  Have you been locked up?  Why they been treated the way they been treated over there?  You've been locked up?  I've been locked up.  Have you been locked up?  I've been locked up.  I haven't been locked up in over 20 years.  So who has the highest incarceration rate in America?  so they fit the same curse you fit.  that's right.  i thought the curses were exclusive as a whole bro As a whole.  Our condition is way less than theirs.  Who went on slave ships first?  Do we got any business?  Who went on slave ships first?  Do we have any business?  Yes, we do have business.  Where?  I have a business.  Where?  I have a business.  He has a business.  He ain't got a business.  He ain't got a business.  I have a business.  And I'm doing pretty damn good with my business.  Don't you know?  Don't you know?  I got wooly hair and dark skin.  You gonna say I'm not Israelite?  That's right.  Nigga, I'm from the tribe of Judah.  That's right.  show you all of the black businesses.  it's a black business.  right down the street sucker free.  right next to a dominican business nick cannon got the joint with the sugar factory right here.  nick cannon got the joint.  i didn't even know that.  see that yeah.  so nick cannon out of israel liked it.  That is like, y'all name it like businesses.  It's like half of a percent.  What business does a Mexican have?  Half of a percent.  What business does a Mexican have?  Of our whole population, oh, the United States.  That's like half of a percent.  What businesses do Mexicans have?  I believe Mexicans got at least, in the whole, at least 15, 20%.  What businesses?  Can you give me one?  Can you name one?  Dude, they got taco shops all over town.  They don't even own them.  Do they own the taco shops?  The cartel probably owns them.  You say probably now?  So let's say the cartel owns them.  Is that a blessing that they have to sell drugs to other people to start taco shops?  Right.  How is that a blessing?  Let them know.  Dude, they got a country, man.  Do you got a country you can go to?  Are Haitians Israelites?  Do you have a country?  He's Haitian.  He can go to Haiti.  Is he an Israelite?  What about Jamaica?  They got their own land.  So what does having your own land have to do with anything?  Guess what?  The difference is that in Mexico, it's actually Spaniards who are running the country.  That's right.  Let them know.  So they wouldn't let the indigenous run the country and be the top politician?  Nah.  So give me Isaiah chapter 11, verse 12.  That's right.  So we already showed you that King Solomon had an Issachari wife.  She was a Sunamite.  So even back then, the Issacharites had straight hair.  All right?  So it's genetically proven, not even genetically, archaeologically proven that both kingdoms look different.  even 3,000 years ago in 900 B.C.  Before any Edomites came up and started mixing, archaeology said both kingdoms looked different.  It's crazy that you come here and said that because we was just talking about it.  The Dark Ages, dude.  The Dark Ages, everybody had color, man.  That's why they called it the Dark Ages.  How did Asians get the color?  Asians, when we brought them motherfuckers out of them caves, homie, and civilized them, that's when... Because they... They're... Dude, their history didn't start until Alexander the Greek, when he started conquering, when he started conquering shit, man.  And that's when they started mixing with people, man.  Even Asians was black.  Asians was black, too.  When them motherfuckers came out of them caves and we civilized them, and Alexander the Greek, that's when their history started.  with Alexander the Greek, when he started invading and conquering countries bro.  but here's the problem.  and mixing with the people of that land that they conquered did alexander like women japanese dark too.  everybody was black.  alexander like women or men they were faggots.  they like men and women.  faggots like men and women they were fags.  he was actually a homosexual pedophile Like most white men.  So when they conquered, we can't say that they were just raping women at a rapid rate because a white man is a homosexual by nature.  The scriptures tell you that there's no man more profane than Esau, right?  So when they were coming and conquering, they're not even that fertile, right?  So give me that in Isaiah 11, start at verse 12.  Isaiah chapter 11.  Okay, yeah, start right at 12, yeah.  Isaiah chapter 11, verse 12.  And he shall set up an ensign for the nation and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.  So the southern kingdom, Judah, they're dispersed, right?  But the northern kingdom is too.  Go ahead.  The envy also of Ephraim.  The envy of Ephraim.  So it would be a curse that the southern kingdom, which you would be, would have envy to the northern kingdom.  Who is the Northern Kingdom?  Who is your animosity toward?  Because it's prophesied that we would have animosity towards our brothers, towards the Northern Kingdom.  So who's the Northern Kingdom?  to your research, to your studies?  So I can see if you hate them like the Bible says you're supposed to.  not familiar, right?  So we say that the Latinos and the Native Americans are the Northern Kingdom, and it just so happens that you feel a certain type of way about them, because that's biblical prophecy.  Just like before we repented, and when we came to Christ, what Christ do?  Go ahead.  The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversity of Judah shall be cut off.  Right, so the envy of Ephraim shall depart because they feel, if they're not in this truth, they feel a certain type of way about us as well.  You got a lot of Mexicans who don't like niggas.  You got a lot of niggas who don't like Mexicans.  That's not only is that part of the curses, that's a part of prophecy.  Prophecy and curses are the most important.  This is how we know who the Israelites are today.  That's right.  So we can't let the white man divide and conquer us.  I got a statistic for you.  Who's getting gunned down more in the streets?  Mexicans or blacks?  Let's go to L.A.  and you'll find out.  It might sell.  Brothers being killed on the daily.  On the news, they making blacks.  By Hispanics.  Okay, police.  Police.  I understand gang wars.  You can't get no jobs in L.A.  I understand gang wars.  They got all the jobs locked up just like here.  We got all the jobs in Atlanta.  We got all the jobs in Atlanta.  So he's gonna come to Atlanta and say, these niggas got all the jobs in Atlanta.  All the barbershops, all the soul food restaurants.  They the racist motherfuckers you've ever seen in your life in  L.A.,  homie.  They racist as hell.  Yeah, and so are we.  Hey, let him know.  Let him know, man.  Tell him about your pops.  Is your pops racist towards Latinos?  So that's not, that's the same.  That's right.  You got black people who don't like Mexicans.  You got Mexicans who don't like black people.  My grandma loved white people and hate Mexicans.  You see that?  But our hate comes from, our hate stems from from oppression and from some shit that happened to us over the years.  Naturally, we're not hateful people, but our hate comes from the way we've been treated over these hundreds of years.  So who treated us like that?  Mexicans?  That's where our hate stems from.  I'm saying, why do we hate Mexicans?  Why?  Other than why I'm showing you in the Bible.  What's your thesis of why we have a hatred towards Mexicans?  Because we got a history of not liking each other for years.  We've been fighting for each other for years.  For how long?  Man, I'm from  L.A.,  brother.  How long?  What part of L.A.  are you from?  We got a history.  We got a history.  We're from Inglewood.  Inglewood?  We're from a history.  My family's from Calcutta, Santana block.  There's a treaty with the Mexicans right now.  They're having a good old time.  They got a treaty?  They got a treaty right now?  Yeah, they got a treaty with the Mexicans right now in Calcutta.  You're very, you are a ten-toed for the stallions.  This is what I'm warning you about.  Black and brown.  It's lasted 10 years, brother.  Since I came to LA.  Since I came to California.  It's lasted 10 years.  The Santana Block Cribs, they got the black and brown movement going on to this day.  That's right.  So why are you different castes preaching differently, though?  Y'all got different philosophies, man.  All the thing that matters is give me Ecclesiastes 12.  I'm going to tell you the only thing that matters.  Why don't y'all do that, man?  Give me Ecclesiastes 12 and 13.  Y'all put me on the same page, though.  It's minor shit.  We with the Mashera Yasharallah.  We, you know, with every camp.  So you can't blame us for the dividing because we're with the Mashera Yasharallah.  We do unity camps with all camps.  Unless you love white people like GLCC, then we ain't... boxing with you.  So bring that out.  Let me tell you what, as long as all camps teach this, that's all that matters.  Go ahead.  Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.  Here's the conclusion of what all camps should be teaching.  Go ahead.  Fear God and keep his commandments.  So if a camp is teaching that, you know, That's all that matters.  Because what's going to get us out of this captivity?  Keeping the laws, taxes, and commandments.  That's right.  When you read Deuteronomy 28, it says, if you obey these laws, then you'll be blessed.  If you break the laws, then you'll be cursed.  So how do we get out of mass incarceration, mass poverty, oppression?  Rape, rob, murder, drugs.  How do we get out of that?  The Bible's clear.  Keep the law, statutes, and commandments.  That's right.  What's a part of the law, statutes, and commandments?  A man named Yehoshua HaMashiach in Numbers 24 in Deuteronomy 18.  So that's where the perfect mix comes from.  When I say keep the law... Say that and say the name again.  Yehoshua HaMashiach.  You sure it ain't... Yehoshua?  Yehoshua?  No, it's not.  Or Yah?  That's... Or... Yahweh?  No.  Or, what's the other one?  Why all y'all camps got different names, too?  Because some camps don't study.  But again, like I said, as long as they teach the law, studies, and commandments, then that's the gist of it.  That's the meat and potatoes of this truth, man.  Y'all had my attention, man.  I was about to join, man.  And then I got to looking at other camps.  I'm like, wait a minute.  Then I go back to this one and say, why are these... Then I just backed up, man.  I'm just gonna be solo for a minute.  Then I do some more research.  That's good, that's good.  So how long has it been?  It's been about... It's been about a year or so, man.  A year or so.  So it's taken you a year to do your research to figure out what you're going to do?  I've been doing research.  I've been doing research.  So why are you cutting your beard?  Why aren't you keeping the law of thatchers?  That's right.  I'm still working on it, bro.  I'm still working on me right now.  Like I said, it's been about a year or so right now, man.  But I'm going to come around.  But until I see you guys get on the same page, man, I'm going to just believe in what I believe, do my prayers, stay prayed up.  And that's where I'm at right now.  What are you praying to?  You know, I don't even use those names.  I just say the Most High.  So you have a problem with us using different names, but you don't even use any names.  I just say the Most High, Heavenly Father, and the Messiah.  That's what I use.  Because I've been getting all these different names from all these different camps.  I'm confused.  I don't know which name to use.  So I just say the Heavenly Father, you know what I'm saying, the Most High, or the Divine Creator, something like that.  That's what I do.  So have you studied the Hebrew?  Have you did any research on the Hebrew?  A little bit.  Okay, so when you look at the Tetragrammaton or the characters that make up the Tetragrammaton, it's very simple, brother.  There was no vowel points.  That didn't come to the matrius lexionis or whatever it was called that the Masorese put into play and put vowel points on the characters.  So before that, it was just ya-ha-wa.  Ya-ha-wa.  Ya-ha-wa.  Ya-ha-wa.  So why you changed the name?  We didn't change the name.  I said Yah-ha-shai.  That's how you say Joshua.  That's how you say Christ's name in the Paleo-Hebrews.  Yah-ha-shai.  You believe in masculine conception or you believe he was the seed of Joseph?  Well, let me ask you a question.  What makes you an Israelite?  Your mom or your father?  Father.  Your father.  So how is Christ an Israelite?  Tom.  Goodbye, sir.  That means Joseph had sex with Mary. ",
