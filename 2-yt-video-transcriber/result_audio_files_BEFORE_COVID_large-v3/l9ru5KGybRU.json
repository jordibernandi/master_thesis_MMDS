            "text": "Hey Dan, my name is Erica.  Thanks for doing these videos, I think they are hilarious.  Long story short, I've been dating this guy for a year and a half and he has never gone down on me.  I am extremely clean and I'm pretty sure I don't stink.  He says he just doesn't like doing it.  Is he a wimp or what?  Like just put your face on my .  Other than that, everything's great.  First off, it doesn't sound like everything's great.  No, but seriously, thank you for your question.  I think this is the first one we're doing from a woman.  For those of you who are watching who are new, We do these every week.

So this is an interesting topic because I've heard a lot of mixed opinions from guys who either love hating it That makes a lot of sense, Daniel.  Jesus Christ.  From a lot of guys who love doing it and a lot of guys who hate it.  But personally, I think I can shed a little bit of light on this topic, both from my own experience and just kind of what I've heard.  Sorry, I'm making dinner right now.  You got turkey burgers and hash browns.  What a weird combination is that?  First off, there's for sure a few things that I could say that would keep a man from going down there.  First of all, make sure that before you're about to do the deed that you shower.  And make sure it don't smell down there.  I like fish, but not that much.  let's see how this kid.  secondly if your bush looks like your neighbor's front yard i'm sorry but no guy wants a tree stuck between his teeth.  after licking your my bush appears to be unleashed.  that just doesn't look good now.  i know a lot of chicks live by the standard of if he doesn't go down don't keep them around.  But if it smells or tastes like you just got done eating at Joe's Crab Shack, you couldn't pay me a thousand bucks to go down on you.  But on a real note, maybe he's scared and he has no idea what he's doing, so walk him through it.  Make it a group activity.  It did!  It looked amazing!  Look at that!  That looks like what you would buy from a store!  Look at all this.  more space!  So much aerobics in here!  So many activities!  Maybe he's scared what you'll think.  But seriously though, I think your real problem is communication.  Obviously there's a deeper problem that he's got and he's just not telling you for whatever reason.  So just ask him.  Why don't you like licking my butt?  So my advice to you is make it look pretty and buy one of those smell good sprays or whatever the hell y'all use.  And make it happen, Cap'n.  When the storm rolls in, I'm gonna be ready.  Side piece of my head in case it gets heavy Like a cowboy kicking down doors and taking names John Wayne. ",
