            "text": "Hello, everyone.  I hope you're all doing well.  In today's video, I want to expound upon a sentiment that seems to be coming more and more true lately, at least from what I can observe.  And that is that the world is being run by children.  Let me explain.  Obviously, I don't so much mean it in the literal sense, despite the fact that there actually are a few extremely influential children nowadays who are spearheading national and even international campaigns.  I mean it more in the sense that the world seems to be run by adults with the mentality of children.  The loudest, most emotional, and oftentimes the most illogical voices, voices that some would argue are voices of useful idiots, seem to be given the biggest platforms and the loudest microphones.  There's nothing wrong with open borders.  Why a brave Democrat should make the case for vastly expanding immigration?  The Abortion Actually campaign by the National Women's Law Center says, abortion is healing.  Abortion is selfless.  Abortion is compassion and abortion is love.  Preserving my children's innocence is an act of preserving white supremacy.  Calls to end inhumane border conditions aren't enough.  ICE must be abolished.  Marriage is sexist.  Give me a civil partnership any day.  A second article seeming to agree with this sentiment says quote, the meaning of marriage is so deeply rooted in patriarchy and gender inequality that in the modern sense, it does not make sense for a young woman to tie the knot unless she has a partner willing to reject all traditional overtures of marriage.  Now granted, it's probably not exactly fair to say that these people have genuine power, It's more appropriate to say that they're given the illusion of power while in reality being figureheads that are simply being used as tools to promote certain narratives and to bring about certain changes in our society.  They're the visible faces of a revolution against order, the standard norm, and against reality in general.  That said, much of their ideology wouldn't be effective, much less even be taken seriously, if it weren't being constantly promoted by the most powerful people and institutions from from Hollywood, to the media, to wealthy elites, to politicians, and to the education system.  For many of these useful idiots, for lack of a better term, I know it sounds kind of mean, I don't mean it that way, but it's just the best term that seems to explain them.  So anyways, for many of them, there seems to be an ever increasing shift towards equating their personal imaginations with reality.  If I think that I am something, or if I feel that something is true, then it therefore must be true.  BBC films teach children of 100 genders or more.  The broadcaster has been accused of sowing confusion in classroom materials to be shown to children as young as nine.  All masculinity is toxic.  Feminist writer and activist John Stoltenberg believes we need to give up manhood for good if we want to live morally sound and love-filled lives.  Ex-transgender man now wants to live as sexless alien and has had nipples removed.  Jareth Nebula, 33, has shunned human genders and wants to be accepted as a being from another planet.  I've gone back to being a child.  Husband and father of seven, 52, leaves his wife and kids to live as a transgender six-year-old girl named Stephanie.  Science at its core is systematically racist and sexist.  Fathers aren't necessary.  Finally getting off the patriarchal BS bandwagon.  Instasham.  Is this teen the new Rachel Dolezal?  White girl wears grills, makes rap videos, and has her hair in dreadlocks as she claims she's black.  The new masculinity issue from GQ.  Back when you were a child, did you ever have moments where you either pretended to be or maybe you even wanted to be something else?  like a character from a video game, or a movie, or a princess, or even a unicorn, maybe.  I don't know.  I mean, I think that most of us did.  I know that I certainly did.  The difference, though, is that at least for most of us, our parents, teachers, friends, and society in general, didn't reinforce this delusion.  Had my parents been like, oh my gosh, yes, sweetie, totally.  If you see yourself as a unicorn, that's what you are.  And we're gonna march right down to the school right now, talk to your principal about having everybody in the school refer to you as a unicorn.  Who knows how damaging that would have been for me psychologically.  Another difference is that sooner or later, children reach the age of reason.  They develop the ability to reason and deduce, and at this point, much more is demanded of them.  They're not only expected to fit into the societal order, they're expected to contribute to it.  Unfortunately, this sort of mentality seems to be becoming a thing of the past.  Some of the most powerful people and institutions of our time now actively reinforce delusion to the point that it's impeding many from ever reaching any kind of level of reason.  no matter how old they are, and in this sense, it's more like a disorientation.  Our society really is doing a great disservice, not only to these people, but to all of us that the choices of these people affects for the sake of personal feelings.  No society powered by feelings, personal whims, and imaginations is going to survive long.  Feelings are too unstable, fleeting, and oftentimes in conflict with reality.  This is why every day it seems as if we're waking up to a matter and matter world.  Oh, and they can get their periods, too.  Woman, 30, claims to be in a five-year relationship with Boeing 737-800. she nicknames Darling and wants to marry.  Man who, quote, never felt human now lives his life as a dog in a 2,000-pound fur suit.  A white man raising their hand to comment in history class is violence.  Math is apparently now racist and Seattle schools want to incorporate this into their math education.  Another catastrophic consequence of this childlike mentality is a lack of respect for authority.  but I suppose it only makes sense.  If a person is taught that the entire world should run according to their personal feelings and then their personal feelings dictate that there's no way that they should ever be subject to a higher and oftentimes necessary authority, then why should they?  Instead of obeying authority, instead of respecting the natural order, and instead of focusing on building upon past achievements in order to truly progress as a society, these people are instead obsessed with focusing upon and finding something racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, fill in the blank with every single aspect of our society and then tearing it all down.  Down with the police, down with history, down with borders, down with teachers, down with the nuclear family, down with the president.  As Fulton Sheen asks, can you build anything down?  No, you can't.  While it's perfectly fine to want to replace negative aspects of our society, these people aren't aiming for the negative aspects.  They're aiming for the imperfect, but the necessary ones.  And worse, they're sorely incapable of building up anything worthy in their place.  This frightening disorientation we're witnessing has stemmed from a lot of things, frankly.  For example, parents and the manner in which they raise their children.  It's also taught at schools and universities and then reinforced by movies, music, public figures, the media, and so on.  All seem to be working together to infect our society with a disorienting virus that once it's taken root, seems almost impossible to not only stop, but to reverse.  As the disorientation takes a stronger hold on those infected, reality seems to get farther and farther away.  And for those of us who do remain sane, we're sometimes tempted to question if we're the crazy ones, or if in fact the patients are now running the asylum.  The answer to this problem is actually simpler than one might think.  We must never allow ourselves to deny what we know to be true.  whether it be out of fear or exhaustion or even a desire for acceptance.  We must protect the truth at all costs, as it alone is what's going to keep our society from devouring itself from the inside out.  As Ben Johnson once wisely said, stand for truth.  It is enough.
