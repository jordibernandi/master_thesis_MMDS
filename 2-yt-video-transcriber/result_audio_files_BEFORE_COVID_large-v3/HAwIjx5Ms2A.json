            "text": "Hi, this is Dr.  Gregory Sadler.  I'm a professor of philosophy and the president and founder of an educational consulting company called Reason.io, where we put philosophy into practice.  I've studied and taught philosophy for over 20 years, and I find that many people run into difficulties reading classic philosophical texts.  Sometimes it's the way things are said or how the text is structured, but the concepts themselves are not always that complicated, and that's where I come in.  To help students and lifelong learners, I've been producing longer lecture videos and posting them to YouTube.  Many viewers say they find them useful.  What you're currently watching is part of a new series of shorter videos, each of them focused on one core concept from an important philosophical text.  I hope you find it useful as well. ",

            "text": "James Rachels in his classic analysis, The Challenges of Cultural Relativism, sets out and isolates five sets of claims that he takes to be really at the heart of any formulation of cultural relativism.  And he reviews quite a few of them, some coming from anthropologists, some coming from our general Western culture in late modernity.  And each of these he sets out so that we can look at them in turn and see whether they're actually plausible.  So first let's see what each of them is, and then talk a little bit about their implications, what the meaning of them would be, Rachel's own viewpoint on their interdependence or contradiction, and then some of the rejoinders or qualifications that he thinks are important to set out in this piece.  So the first is quite simple.  Different societies have different moral codes.  The second, the moral code of a society determines what is right in that society.  He actually adds a little bit to that.  That is, if the moral code of a society says a certain action is right, that action is right, at least within that society.  The third is there is no objective standard that can be used to judge one society's code as better than another's.  There's no moral truths that hold for all people at all time.  The fourth, the moral code of our own society has no special status.  It is but one among many.  Then fifth and finally, it is arrogant for us to judge other cultures.  We should always be tolerant of them.  So now let's look at each of these a little bit more closely.  Different societies have different moral codes.  This is supposed to be not so much a normative statement, but a descriptive statement telling us about how judgments and evaluations are made about moral matters within those societies.  And Rachel's gives you, several now classic examples, one from Herodotus, where the Greeks are told that, you know, somebody is proposing for them to eat their dead and another group of people are told that the proposal is that they should burn their dead and both of them recoil in horror from what the other group supposedly do.  And this is supposed to demonstrate to us that there are different customs, different deeply felt and held beliefs and sentiments about what's right and wrong.  And this is quite true.  Even within the same society, we often have incredible variance among moral judgments, don't we?  Even people within the same culture disagree about what is right and wrong.  The second one, the moral code of a society determines what is right in that society.  This is a somewhat stronger claim.  If we're understanding it merely in a descriptive way, then we could say the moral code of a society determines for the members of the society or other people within that society trying to take part in it, what counts as right or wrong.  But this is going a little bit further.  It's saying right and wrong is actually determined as such by what society that you're in.  And it's sort of like, you know, Pascal's observation that on this side of the Pyrenees, this is true.  And on this side of the Pyrenees, this is false.  Different sides of the Pyrenees, of course, being France and Spain.  The third one, there is no objective standard to judge one society's code as better than another with the implication that there are no moral truths that hold for all people at all times.  Again, a very strong claim.  There's no way to say that, one code or even one portion of a code.  Say perhaps the parts that have to do with how to bury or not bury or dispose of or not dispose of the dead or how long one should remain in mourning and what one ought to wear or whether one ought to be married and what marriage is going to look like.  Those would all be parts of codes.  And then we could talk about the totality of a culture's code as well.  This is saying we cannot judge any of them in relation to each other.  It doesn't mean that you can't judge within a particular society that there would be better and worse ways of doing things, but that would fall into the number two category, wouldn't it?  You're already within that society at that point.  The fourth is very interesting.  This one is not going to apply to all societies, but to modern Western industrialized, liberal, democratic, however, whatever qualifications we want to place on it.  We should not try to say that our moral code has any sort of special status.  It is merely one among many different possibilities, no better, no worse than any of them.  Presumably the moral code that we have today is no better than the one that we had within our society, say in 1950 or 1850 or 1750 as well.  So that would be a bit of an implication of that.  And then finally, probably the strongest claim of all, number five, it is arrogant to judge other cultures.  We should instead, take an attitude of tolerance towards all of them.  This is what the cultural relativist is telling us as again, members of modern liberal Western Democrats. ",
