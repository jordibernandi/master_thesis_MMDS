Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns, and we're not stopping there.  How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio?  Raise your hands.  It's not just you, Amazon alone is closing 30% of America's stores and malls, soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes.  These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution.  And that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office.  The fact is Donald Trump, when we're talking about him, we are losing.  We need to present a new vision and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump. ",

And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century, to me, is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.  Also, Senator Sanders' description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who's at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic.  We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month.  It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities.  It helps all Americans transition.  Because the fact is, and you know this in Ohio, if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.  When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle up economy from our people, our families and our communities up.  It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do.

The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected.  If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from?  We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes.  Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax.  If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands because we know best how to use it.

There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio.  And for some reason, the federal government thought that was appropriate.  They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money, until you realize that company made $30 billion.  They got a 2% fine.  and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.  So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well.  Even though this is not a money problem, we all know this is a human problem.  And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell.  They will be referred to treatment and counseling.  I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again.  Because the fact is after you save someone who's ODing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week.  So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use.  We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing.  This was a systemic government failing.  And then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country because they save lives. ",

It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app.  That would be like cruel punishment.  There's a reason why no one is using Bing today.  Sorry, Microsoft.  It's true.  So it's not like breaking up.  these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country.  And as the parent of two young children, I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children.  Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.  Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier.  What we have to do is we have to home in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems.  Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work.  We need new solutions and a new toolkit.  The best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property.  Right now, our data is worth more than oil.  How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail?  It got lost.  It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google.

My surprising friendship.  It's been so much fun running for president because I've gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise.  The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred who's an avid Trump supporter, a trucker.  He let me ride in his truck for hours.  He spent some time in jail.  I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs.  And I'm happy to say that after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me.  And we've remained in touch ever since.  The truth is that what happened to the four million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party.  The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists.  It does not care about our party.  Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016.  What did he say?  He said, we're going to build a wall.  We're going to turn the clock back.  We're going to bring the old jobs back.  America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things.  We have to turn the clock forward.  We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible.  We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value.  It is not left.  It is not right.
