They got somebody else detained right up the street.  Hopefully we can make it.  They got one right here.  Yeah.  They got one over there.  Holy shit.  Watch the cops, man.  They're everywhere right now.  Yeah.  This is crazy.  This is vomiting.  This is the type of shit that's going on.  Y'all come over here and toss me, I ain't do nothing.  You didn't even know I was on parole.  Is it a panic attack?  It's not a panic attack.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't even matter.  What matters is you're touching on me.  I'm sure you are.

Come on.  Did you guys record this from the beginning when I was just walking?  I don't think I got it, but got your back, man.  What's your name?  Rembrandt.  So ask.  They just stopped you walking?  Yeah.  They didn't stop me walking.  Come on, I was right in front of you.  Let's hear this.  Sit down.  For what?  Because I told you to.  I'm not going to ask you again.  You guys literally violated my rights right there, man.  Sit down.  We'll put you in the seat.  You need to sit down.  You understand that?  You understand what's going on right now?  You need to sit down.  You need to sit down.  That's not force.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Okay.  Let's just go.  We'll go do this all under the influence stuff.  And if you're going to act like a disappointment, you can't be out here in public.  Okay?  Dude, you have no right.  I should have taken him.  Oh, damn it.  What are you doing?  Maybe this is the sergeant, you know.  Answer my question.  He is the sergeant.  See, he got some shit to do.  Thanks for watching! ",
