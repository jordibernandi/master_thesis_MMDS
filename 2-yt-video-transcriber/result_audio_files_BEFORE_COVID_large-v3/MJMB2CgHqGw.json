And then he said if we talk about him or Blair White, last week's guest, references him in any way, he would sue our shoe.  I presume that was a misspelling of show, but he said shoe.  So while I have some expensive shoes, none of them are worth it.  What is the deal with Onision?  How did he get on your radar and why have you been dogging him so hard? ",

            "text": "So last week I was reached out by Chris Hansen.  For those of you who don't know, he's been doing and catching Preda.  Can't say that last word.  He's been catching horrible people who have been doing horrible things, trying to exploit and hurt small, young people.  It's the best way I can put it without YouTube demonetizing me.  He's most famously known for having the show to catch a preta.  T-O-R-S.  But before they even reached out to me, they reached out to the one and only Onision.  And get this, you're being invited by the one and only Chris Hansen to go on his show and clear your name of any allegations of any controversy.  You have a platform to speak for absolutely free to someone who is one of the most reputable people in that business in regards to crime reporting.  But instead of doing the normal, rational thing of saying, yeah, I'd love to go on your show, he says he would only appear if he was paid $350,000 and that if they choose to speak about him, he was going to, in fact, sue the show, which is laughable because, you know, Greg's been doing that for years, threatening me, claiming lawsuits that ultimately are never going to happen.  I mean, him wanting $350,000 to appear on a show to clear his name kind of makes sense considering that he probably does, in fact, have something to hide.  That much we know for sure.  But two, he's still dealing with so much tax evasion fraud, owing the IRS hundreds of thousands of dollars that this is his only scapegoat.  Demand an insane amount of money that no one's going to pay just to clear your name.  Any normal, rational person would jump at the opportunity to do so.  But not Greg, so Chris invited me on his show.  And that's what I did last night.  It's linked down below in the description.  I recommend you watch the whole thing.  Chris is really good at his job.  He asks some very, very good questions.  And you know, big things have small beginnings, and we're finally moving forward with some stuff in regards to one of the most reputable people online who's put hundreds of people in prison finally looking into the one and only Onision.

So also last week on Chris Hansen's live show, Blair White was invited to attend and Onision was discussed a little bit.  But something that was really interesting is that the moment Chris Hansen's show ended last week, Onision did what he does best.  He announced on Facebook that he was shutting down yet again his, I think, fifth or sixth web form in which you have users join and create threads and talk.  Now the reason that he shut down his form yet again as you can see in this Facebook post here, he announces, I'm all done with this, I'm shutting down my forum yet again for his fifth, sixth time, is because Chris Hansen is onto him.  Chris Hansen is talking about him.  Chris Hansen is investigating Onision.  Which, when you put that in perspective, somebody as reputable and as big name as Chris Hansen himself.  looking into somebody like Onision, it would make anybody tremble and their boots.  But most of all then, several days later, Onision did a live stream on his YouTube channel, and he passive-aggressively mentioned why he wouldn't attend Chris Hansen's show, despite him being invited on there.  And of course, I can't show you the footage because Onision will strike my video, but Greg says that he will not go on Chris Hansen's show, simply because at some point, Chris Hansen dealt with some legal-related issues.  More specifically, there was an article at the start of the year that said that he had some bounced checks.  What did he do?  Chris Hansen turned himself in and the charges were completely, utterly dropped.  No criminal charges, nothing.  Sometimes a bounce check happens.  Regardless, that was his experience.  for not attending Chris Hansen's show, but he said something completely different.  He said he won't attend the show unless he's paid $350,000.  So which one is it, Greg?  Call someone a criminal when they're not?  Give some bogus excuse for why you won't appear on the show to clear your name?  Multiple other people who have had allegations against them have appeared on Chris Hansen's show when they were invited, but you're not the only person who wouldn't do it.  In my mind, that just screams that you really are trying to hide something even more than you've already tried and failed miserably at.  These type of email exchanges are becoming more and more common.  He is losing his income, he is losing his support, and it's only getting more and more and more, which is a good thing.  Hi Greg, dropping in to tell you that I pulled my funds from you and Kai's Patreon because I can't support people like yourselves.  Keep trying to deny everything, go ahead, but there's a... so much proof.  I've supported you since the beginning and wanted to see the best, but honestly, finding out everything and seeing all the proof, I can't support a pretta.  And look at his response.  Yikes.  One response.  Yikes.  Yikes indeed, Greg.  In this brief email exchange, simply explaining why she is no longer going to support him, his response is, and I can't believe of him of all people would say this, Please stop writing me.  You are harassing me.  That is the only thing here that is an actual fact.  I don't think this is harassment.  I messaged you telling you I pulled my funds because I will not support Pretta.  people like yourself and behavior, which is really abhorrent and you're deflecting.  So you don't have to answer real questions.  I'm not in any way, shape or form harassing you.  I'm literally telling the reasons why I remove myself from toxicity.  The facts are everywhere about the behavior.  I'm not sorry that I'm messaging you and telling you how it is because I have factual information and proof of your actions and these claims against you, which aren't even claims.  They're flat out truths.  I'm ashamed.  I ever even spent my money on you.  Stop messaging me.  This is harassment.  Oh, like your most recent Eugenia video that you uploaded just the other day.  Which, by the way, I believe you're at a total of 70 videos in total that you've made about, uh, Eugenia.  70?  You know, Greg, I've been on your, on your, uh... keeping record of you for the last, like, eight years, right?  And in eight years, I haven't even made 50 videos about you.  In eight years.  And yet, in the less than two, three years, you've managed to put out 71... I believe 70... 70 to 75 videos about... EC, Eugenia, which is just insane to me that you're still talking about her, that you just cannot stop talking about her.  You say you're gonna stop at something, you don't stop at it and you just continue it.  Now this is really funny just to show you how easily baited Onision is because he is struggling financially and typically, I don't want to, you know, wallow in somebody's suffering when it comes to financial issues, but he's an exception to that rule, because I really don't care about him as a person, and he's done so many horrible things that... I just don't care.  If you're willing to do a dedicated video, that would be fantastic.  That would be great.  Alright, please pay half the amount now, and half when the video is done.  Wait, I'm sorry, but this deal has to be foreclosed.  One of my HR told me about some of the recent allegations surrounding you, and we can't have our company associated with that.  Thanks for your time, though.  Elysian replies with, Whoa, that's crazy, because someone just told me that you are a... R. So I couldn't work with you, sorry.  Well, that's a bit ironic, don't you think?  Because after all, you accused me of being a R at one point, Greg.  I didn't really appreciate that, considering that there was no evidence and there's never been any testimony or evidence of any of the things that you've ever claimed in regards to me specifically.  But hey, you know what?  Comes around, goes around.  I'm not the one denying, declare my name of allegations which have been proven factually that you are and have done particular things.  And the reason that you're losing everything slowly but surely is because people are finally seeing it for what it is.  You can't just keep living this life of denial.  But that's the life that you keep wanting to live.  And at that point, there's really nothing I can do, anyone can do.  It is definitely in the right hands and it's getting the right coverage.  because there was two big articles.  written about Onision and Kai on Chris Hansen's website.  I'm not joking.  This is absolutely pure gold.  Both of these articles are linked down below.  Again, they're on Chris's website, but I think one of my favorite things is one of the articles, it ends it with, Onision and Kai may not get what they want much of the time, but they will not receive their demanded $350,000 for an opportunity to have a seat with Chris Hansen.  I'm just so happy that he's finally getting the coverage that we've all been wanting and asking for for years.  This is a really significant good thing that's happening with him.  People like myself, people who are smaller YouTubers, people like Blair, people who talk about Onision's constant new behaviors that he does, update people constantly, it's a good thing.  Because I think at this point now, Justice can finally start moving forward, and that he's not gonna keep living in the shadows of YouTube getting away with everything, at least that's what I think that's gonna happen.  I hope that's going to happen.  And him denying to be involved with Chris Hansen on the show is really kind of condemning of him, in my opinion.
