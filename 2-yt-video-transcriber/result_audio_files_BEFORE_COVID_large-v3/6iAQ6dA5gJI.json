With or without it, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.  But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.  It's a very powerful, albeit imperfect, quote that I'm reminded of nearly every time I see the religious attempt to justify the atrocities of their scripture.  Be it grotesque misogyny, violent homophobia, or straight-up slavery, the religious either accept and celebrate such verses, as is the case with many Jews, Christians, and most Muslims when it comes to misogyny and homophobia, or they go to breathtakingly disingenuous lengths to dismiss, justify, and contextualise these verses, as is the case with them all when it comes to slavery.  No, no, they cry, it was indentured servitude.  That's all, it was voluntary, and after six years you were let free anyway.  Love thy neighbour, that's what matters.  Slavery in the Hebrew culture was volitional. ",

Because, maybe it's just me, but I'd count owning other people's property as a tad bit worse than mixing wool and linen.  Before we delve into the three primary justifications of Abrahamic slavery, it's worth firstly reminding ourselves of what the scripture actually says.  Slavery is rampant throughout both the Old and New Testaments, which together provide rules and regulations for several categories of slave.  Exodus 21 verses 2 through 6 distinguishes Hebrew male slaves by commanding that they are to be set free after six years.  What's more, if they came into slavery with a family, they too are to be liberated.  However, if they developed a family during their six years, they'd either have to forsake them or join them in slavery forever.  Moving on, verse 7 clearly establishes a category for Hebrew female slaves, in which it states that fathers can sell their Hebrew daughters into slavery, and that they, quote, shall not go out like the other menservants do.  And as for foreign slaves, or heathen, things were unsurprisingly worse.  Leviticus 25 verse 44 through 46 states that foreigners can be brought, sold, and passed down as inheritance, and that so too can their children.  And while Deuteronomy 24 verse 7 prohibits the kidnapping of Israelites, and Exodus 21 verse 16 seemingly prohibits the kidnapping of foreigners too, there is no verse that prohibits the buying of slaves.  And what's more, Numbers 31 verses 17-18 states that the spoils of war are to be dealt with as follows, \"...execute all the men and little boys, as well as the women who have known a man by lying with him, but keep alive for yourselves.
