            "text": "Thank you.  I've got my face in the camera and I don't like it.  Well, you guys are on the sidewalk, so it's not our property, but we'd like you to leave.  You're pointing it inside the shop?  I can't have it.  I'm just relaxed.  Am I running you?  All right!  Nasty Nathaniel out here in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada.  And joining me is Pugface Media.  And together we're going to be conducting a First Amendment audit of the Church of Scientology's Celebrity Center.  Yeah!  It's a full-functioning Scientology org here in the city of Los Angeles.  Or excuse me, the city of Las Vegas.  And we're going to make sure that our friends at the Church of Scientology here in Las Vegas respect and honor our constitutional right to record in public.  So let's go over there and go to church.  Now we got somebody here coming out.  She looked like she was going to stop for a moment.  She's going rather slow.  She's Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Well, this got weird fast.  Sign right there.  lets us know exactly where we are.  We're at the Church of Scientology and Celebrity Center, Las Vegas.  So this facility here was opened in February of 2010, so it's not quite 10 years old.  And COB, David Miscavige himself, was amongst the speakers, which included some local city officials.  Scientology likes to do that.  They like to bring in people from the local government in whatever community.  they're opening up one of these orgs.  You know, to kind of make it look like, you know, a lot of people support them.  Hi!  Hi, how can I help you?  I'm fine, thank you.  Okay, what's happening?  Huh?  What's happening?  We're just filming.  Oh, you're filming?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Where are you from?  Huh?  Where are you from?  I'm from around here.  Oh, you are?  What's your name?  Huh?  What's your name?  Hello?  Huh?  I said, what's your name?  Oh, I don't have a name.  Yeah, yeah, I'm just filming.  you can call me cameraman.  It's this guy.  he's looks like he's wearing like a security uniform.  He must be the muscle.  And then we got Buddy Ollie over here.  Oh, he's on the phone.  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  We're in trouble now.  They're still keeping an eye on us.  Well, that didn't take long at all, folks.  I mean, they came out quick.  So, just goes to show you We are being watched.  I'm sure they probably already got my license plate from when I drove by here earlier before I parked.  Oh, they're both on the phone.  Ooh.  Hi!  Hi, what's your name?  Who, me?  Yeah.  I want to maintain my privacy in public.  Okay, that's fine.  I'm just making a video, that's all I'm doing.  Okay.  That's all I'm gonna say.  Well, you guys are on the sidewalk, so it's not our property, but we'd like you to leave.  Leave the public sidewalk?  Well, you're standing in our driveway right now.  I'm walking.  Okay, thank you.  Do you know Parker Osmond?  I'll take that as a yes.  Oh, Buddy Holly over there is still on the phone.  He's still... and there's the enforcer.  so yeah they're not digging this too much.  oh wow look at that it's a it's a hyundai clean machine.  hi so i'm on camera huh yeah oh yeah well uh what you doing?  filming Huh?  Are you a Scientologist?  Not going to be on HBO or Showtime?  Are you a Scientologist?  Yeah, I'm a Scientologist.  Awesome.  Where are you on the bridge?  What's your name?  Huh?  What's your name?  Cameraman.  Oh, you're one of those guys.  All right.  Anyway, have fun.  Have a good day.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care.  I got this lady that just pulled up.  Uh-oh, he's... Oh, cam back!  Cam back!  And then this guy that was leaving just pulled back in.  Now he's over there talking with Buddy Holly.  Oh yeah, we're definitely getting police on this one.  Or maybe not, I don't know.  Maybe they're going to bring Odo over here.  He's coming out.  Let's see if he's going to... Let's see... Have a groovy day.  Well, what's this?  It looks like we're being watched.  She's smoking.  It's okay to smoke in Scientology because L Ron Hubbard smoked and that makes it okay.  Oh, we got Buddy Holly again.  Oh, is that the muscle?  Is that the big security man there?  He's going to run us over with his big foot mobile.  Oh, so some sporty, bright orange shoes.  he's got on there.  Let's take a look.  Whoa.  Those must be what they give you when you reach OT7.  I can only imagine what you get when you reach OT8.  What was that?  Did you see anything good?  Oh, yeah, just a lot of weirdness.  It's Scientology, you know.  Right.  Well, Buddy Holly's over there talking with the Godfather.  That kind of reminds me of somebody.  I wonder who it is.  Like maybe some old Las Vegas mobster like Henry Hill.  Go in there, buddy.  Get on course.  All right, I'm going to go ahead and wrap this audit up.  Pugface Media and I, that is.  I'm not really sure what to call this.  They're definitely not happy about us being here.  The guy that came out in the suit that looked like Buddy Holly told us, acknowledged that we were on a public sidewalk, but at the same time also said he'd like us to leave.  Obviously, we didn't leave.  We've been here for quite a while, and I wish there wasn't a plane flying overhead so I could finish my closing narration.  Ah!  All right, I'll continue.  So anyways, you guys decide what you think this is.  Is it a pass?  Is it a fail?  You decide.  So please say so in your comments.  We're going to make our way back to the vehicle we came here in.  And let's see if they follow us.  No, wait a minute.  Follow us?  No, Scientology doesn't do that.  They're a church.  They wouldn't follow and stalk and harass people.  Okay, I got a little shot of that guy on the motorcycle.  Now let me tell you something a little bit about him.  He earlier walked past us.  What was that?  Did you see anything good?  Oh yeah, just a lot of weirdness.  As we were filming Scientology and wanted to know if we were filming anything interesting.  And look at where he's pulling into.  He's pulling into the Scientology Center.  So he's a paid goon. ",
