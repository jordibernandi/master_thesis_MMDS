            "text": "Hi brothers and sisters, it's Pastor Tim Henderson.  For over a week now, I've been getting pieces of intel.  What I want to tell you is the stage is being set for major military action, that's what I'm going to say, around the world.  From sources, I'm getting not only in the  U.S.,  Israel in the UK I'm sure in other countries that experts within government within the military like in the u.s.  from what I want to say, intelligence agencies from special forces are being called even out of retirement.  Something major is being planned and going on.  We know the season we're in.  I just want to share with you.  I'm getting that information.  Additionally, Not only is the deep state, the globalist, when I say deep state in the  U.S.,  it's tied to the globalist.  Not only in the U.S.  are they in an uproar since the Russian collusion has been put to rest.  And there's still those who are beyond themselves screaming, he did it, he did it, he did it, when he's been arrested.  proclaimed innocent of any wrongdoing in that.  And I'm not... Listen, this is not a political thing.  There's also the deep state, the globalists in Israel right now also.  In fact, they've, you know, indicted or tried to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  They have the leftists there.  What they don't want is they don't want a peace plan that... will prevent dividing up the land.  They want the land divided.  There is a leftist, globalist group, even in Israel, who want that.  What's interesting is with the action that has been going on, there was a big movement afoot and a real threat to Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  But I'm telling you right now, If you were asking me for my personal prediction, it's that come April 9th, Benjamin Netanyahu will be voted in the prime minister of Israel.  I believe that.  Will the body of Christ be here?  Who knows?  We are in a big watch season.  But I am not setting a day nor hour.  I will never do that.  But I am saying it could be any moment.  And there are significant things going on.  The vitriol and the hatred in Israel against Benjamin Netanyahu by these globalists, by these leftists, is as real as the vitriol and the hatred against Donald Trump.  And I am not making... There is no spiritual solution to a political... There's no political solution, I should say, to a spiritual problem.  Brothers and sisters... We are watching right now.  We are seeing things align.  If everyone on this channel, this family, and I love you guys, if we could all share where we've seen Blackhawks, where we've seen... unusual amounts of military movement, sounds in the skies in the early morning hours or nights in areas where that would not normally happen, things that some of you have reported and sent emails in, and you add that to what's going on around the world.  and then you look at what President Emmanuel Macron is doing in France and in Europe, You look at the extension of not having Brexit, even though the people voted.  The democracy is out the window there in the UK right now.  It doesn't matter what the voice of the people called for.  They've extended it.  What?  They've extended it until June or July, Brexit now?  Because... The Parliament says we want a deal when we Brexit, so we're not going to have a no-deal Brexit.  In other words, they're not going to Brexit without a deal.  You haven't been able to do it now in almost three years, and you think by June or July you're going to have a deal?  It's because the antichrist system is being established.  The convergence of so many things is going on right now.  But keep a watch because I'm getting... And again, people say, well, where's your links?  No, I have... Some say, well, how do you have that?  God ordained that.  I couldn't have done that if I tried.  I do have contacts and... It's not one source telling me.  It's several sources telling me.  Keep your eyes out.  The stage is being set.  Well, we know the stage is being set.  But for something big, something big is about to happen.  My gut, my gut, the Lord did not tell me this, but my gut as a watchman is that The rapture will happen and then all these things are going to explode.  But we don't know.  What we do know is that this is very real.  That the stage is being set.  We also know we're in the final moments of the end of days.  Praise God.  I'm so looking forward.  In the meantime, we want to share the gospel of grace with folks.  But I wanted to let you know.  Key.  Key experts.  And all the significant areas within nations are being called by those nations.  You see the movement in Europe, the establishment.  Listen, for those in the  U.S.,  it's not about the  U.S.,  brothers and sisters.  Keep your eyes on Europe right now.  Keep your eyes on the Middle East.  Pray for our nation.  Pray for Israel.  I know that Benjamin Netanyahu, to believers, some will say, well, he's not even a believer.  Right.  Pray for his salvation.  But also pray.  God is orchestrating things right now.  So that... these things are coming to pass and soon and very soon we are going to see our king.  i am so excited today as i'm getting this information and i'm seeing what's going on.  i'm also excited because i have opportunity to share the gospel of grace with those who will receive it and have asked Holy Spirit to lead me and guide me.  Well, I want you to know God loves you fiercely and passionately.  I love you too.  We are living in exciting times.  God bless you guys and have an awesome rest of your day. ",
