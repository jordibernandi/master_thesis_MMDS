It might not have been their whole life, but this is what they call home.  Just learning from them about their experiences of whether it be transitioning and going through that gender reassignment process whether it be about feeling included or integrated within your own local community.  unfortunately experiences of hate crime and experiences of being misgendered within their own communities and by professionals and a really important part is capturing their hopes and expectations connected to aging what they want to see an older life look like for them as trans individuals and connected to that how they want to be treated by health and social care professionals.

Because our generation were people who more or less did what they were told to do, doctor knows best, we're not good at fighting for our rights.
