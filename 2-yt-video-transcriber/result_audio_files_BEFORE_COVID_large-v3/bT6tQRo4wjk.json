            "text": "So I actually saw this story all over the place, including inside my server, and the irony was palpable.  A vegan activist rescued 16 rabbits, but killed nearly 100 rabbits in the process.  Hello everyone, this is Mr.  Obvious, bringing you the obvious, and today, on thenypost.com.  It's just comical.  You know, it's hilarious.  It's a perfect example of how veganism often backfires in the most hilarious of ways.  Have you seen that clip of the vegans who protest like some sort of meat processing plant by zip-tying themselves to it?  And then one idiot gets pinned and nearly chokes to death.  Let me see if I can find it.  So here's a meat processing plant.  They invade this private property.  They try to rescue the animals.  And this is where they zip tie themselves.  It's bike lots.  Protest people!  These are vegans!  This is what they do!  This is how you stop the massacre!  Don't you understand?  Six Gorillian!  What a tragedy.  So now the hilarious part happens.  Oh boy.  Look at this absolute jackass.  Look at this vegan.  The man lives, by the way.  Monetization on my channel is disabled, so I have to do this plug.  I don't get a choice.  You can join me on Patreon or Subscribestar for as low as one buck if you want to.  If not, okay, that's cool too.  If you like the video, share it.  If you don't, don't.  Life is simple.  A vegan activist in Spain who claimed to have been attacked by an angry mob last week after she rescued 16 rabbits from their farm will end up causing the death of nearly 100 baby bunnies in the process, a report says.  That is just sad.  I'm not gonna honk over that.  She stole 16 rabbits from the farm and 100 baby bunnies perished.  Wow, PETA would be proud.  The activist who goes by the name Mythical Mia.  Oh yeah, and she's a vegan influencer, right?  I think she's on Instagrams.  On social media, conducted the alleged rescue mission on a farm near Osono last Sunday.  And you know, I'm pretty sure this is theft, possibly a felony.  According to the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia, five rabbits which were pregnant and about to give birth were killed during the chaotic retrieval, and others were left with broken spines.  Broken spines.  She broke rabbits' backs.  This woman is a psychopath.  The paper reports signing an assessment from a local veterinarian.  What a sick person.  You see, this is what's wrong with veganism.  This is what's wrong with Instagram.  This is what's wrong with so-called influencers.  It's so cringy.  If you're an influencer, kindly go find a bridge, the highest bridge you can find, and keep walking until you're walking on air, and just walk off into the horizon.  No, actually, do not do that.  It will not end well.  But I certainly would have no pity if you chose to do so, completely independent of anything I've said.  Really, it's just an expression.  But honestly, go fuck yourself.  So Maya, whose real name is unknown, posted a video on her Instagram page last week documenting the bloody aftermath of her rabbit rescue.  This is what just happened to us.  Look, I'm documenting the whole thing.  Oh, that was a big brain move.  The police will surely love your video.  She said, I'm covered in blood.  This is what the farmers have done.  According to the report, this is what you've done.  I'm pretty sure that's rabbit's blood.  They shot through our window and chased us down the motorway.  Oh my God, I'm literally covered in blood.  Probably because of, because of your stupid actions.  How the hell did you kill those rabbits?  You killed pregnant rabbits.  The woman who sounds British has been posting information on her IG page.  It is Instagram, of course, the cancerous Instagram.  God, you know, I hate the fact that people like this exist.  Everyone should get a vote.  Really?  They should?  Even low IQ brainlets like this, you think they should vote?  You think everyone should just be allowed to vote?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  Because I take a look at the world on a daily basis, and I see a bunch of people who can't be trusted.  Driving a car, raising children, must last... She provided an update on the rescued rabbits, confirming that she had to leave thousands of mothers and babies behind.  Yeah, man, a hundred of them died.  These are the sixteen lucky ones!  Lucky you didn't kill them!  Mia said, after actions like this, we get to go home.  But for them, there's no way out.  We only managed to find a home for sixteen beforehand, so had to leave thousands of mothers and babies behind.  They will be trapped inside their cages for their entire lives.  Well, don't worry.  Their lives will probably be short if maniacs like you come around and kill them.  Their only escape is when they're shipped off to a slaughterhouse to be murdered for their flesh and fur.  Yeah, that's why we raise livestock for flesh and fur.  Now, I'll be the first to say, I want my animals in more humane conditions because stress negatively affects the quality of the meat.  And I'm a man of quality because meat is delicious.  and I consume it as if consuming the life force of other beings to empower my own.  Rabbits like these are also abused for animal testing, tortured for a lifetime before eventually getting murdered too.  They are also regularly kept as pets, often in confinement and inappropriate conditions, suffering from boredom and multiple other health issues.  Well, bitch, you literally just gave all those pets away to homes, presumably people who keep them as pets.  Do you see the IQs working here?  About two IQs working very hard to keep this woman alive.  Mia added, what we do to the animals needs to end immediately.  I agree.  Stop breaking rabbit spine.  The injustice was gone on for far too long.  We will continue to enter these facilities.  You're going to jail, woman.  To expose these whores and liberate the beings trapped for as long as it takes.  We are not going anywhere.  Join us in the fight.  Be vegan, be active, and let's put an end to this once and for all.  So, you know, after getting a hundred rabbits killed, I think it's clear to say this woman is looking for the final solution.  I think this is just perfect, you know?  It perfectly explains how insane they are.  So I'm going to show you the clip she posted on Instagrams.  This is what has just happened to us.  Look, I'm documenting the whole thing.  I'm covered in blood.  I'm covered in blood.  Because I snapped a rabbit's neck.  I am the victim. ",

I think it goes without saying that this isn't the first animal massacre committed by a vegan, and it won't be the last.  That's merely the obvious.  Well, that's all for now, folks.  What do you think about this vegan?  What do you think about the activism?  And geez, who do you think was in the wrong here?  I don't even know why I'm asking that question.
