            "text": "What are you laughing at?  Imposed in 1979, China's one-child policy devastated generations of families over its 35 years in effect.  To enforce the strict population control measures, countless children were abducted or killed, women were subjected to forced abortions and sterilizations, and millions of girls disappeared before the Communist Party finally ended the policy in 2015.  In the documentary One Child Nation, out now in select theaters and later this year on Amazon, director Nanfu Wang revisits her experience growing up in rural China in the late 80s and 90s.  The film is at once a deeply personal portrait of family life under the one-child regime and a searing expose of its draconian horrors. ",
