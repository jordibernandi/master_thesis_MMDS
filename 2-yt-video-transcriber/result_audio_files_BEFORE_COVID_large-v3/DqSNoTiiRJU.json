            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Jerusalem, Israel.  We're living in exciting and prophetic times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  We know that the veil is being lifted, 2 Corinthians 3, verse 16, and Jews and Arabs are being saved like never before.  There is a hunger for the truth.  We're living in Amos 8, verse 11 right now.  Those are the times that we're living in right now.  The Orthodox movement in Israel, the Sanhedrin, are doing everything they can to cover up the truth of the gospel, to cover up Bible verses.  But the Bible is clear that everything that is hidden shall be exposed.  And as we're preaching the gospel here in Israel, we're exposing the cover-ups.  Ecclesiastics 12, verse 14.  For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.  As the hunger in Israel continues, and the gospel is being exposed, at many times, Jews see the cover-ups and are upset.  All glory goes to Yeshua, Jesus, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.  We began sharing Ecclesiastics chapter 12, verse 14, asking the people, what does this mean?  An Orthodox man approached me and asked, I see you with a Bible here asking people questions.  What are you asking them?  I introduced myself.  He introduced himself as Shimon Eisenberg.  I then opened the Bible to Ecclesiastics chapter 12, verse 14, and read with Shimon in Hebrew.  For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.  I asked Shimon, what is this Bible verse referring to?  Shimon said, this is Medach Shlomoch, King Solomon, telling us that everything that is hidden, God will expose.  I asked Shimon, Do you believe the Bible is true?  Shimon said, Yes.  I asked Shimon, Would you like to see some of the truth that has been hidden?  Shimon said, yes.  I pulled out the book, the Rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah.  When Shimon saw Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri's name on the book, he asked, is this book written by Yitzhak Kaduri?  I told Shimon, the book is about Yitzhak Kaduri, and inside the book, there is a secret revelation that Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri left, revealing the name of Mashiach, Messiah.  Shimon immediately said, Rabbi Yitzchak Adori was the greatest rabbi that ever lived.  What does this have to do with Ecclesiastics chapter 12 verse 14?  I then opened the book to page 53, the page that reveals the note that Rabbi Yitzchak Adori left in a decoded format, revealing the name of the Messiah as Yeshua or Yehoshua, Jesus.  Shimon then said, this sounds very interesting.  Let's read together.  We read the note together and decoded it as Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri left.  And it spelled the name Yeshua or Yehoshua, Jesus.  When Shimon saw this, he said, this is impossible.  This cannot be that Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri believed in this Yeshua.  And he didn't say the word Yeshua.  He said the word Yeshu, which is a curse word the rabbis invented.  May his name be blotted out forever.  I then told Shimon, you are at the right place at the right time.  God has ordained you to be here today.  And this is the connection with Ecclesiastics chapter 12 verse 14.  For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.  The rabbis have suppressed this, have hidden this.  They don't want you to know the truth that Rabbi Yitzchak Kaduri left us know that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Shimon then said, if this is true, they've hidden the truth from me.  I then asked Shimon if we can study the word of God together.  Shimon agreed.  And right there at the Old City, Shimon and I began to have a Bible study as the Messiah of Israel Ministries team were praying.  I asked Shimon, what does it mean in Hebrew, Immanuel?  Shimon said, Immanuel means in Hebrew, God is with us.  I then turned the Bible to the book of Isaiah, chapter 7, verse 14, and read in Hebrew together with Shimon.  Therefore the Lord himself will give a sign.  Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  When Shimon read this, he was in complete shock.  He couldn't believe his own eyes.  I asked Shimon, can a virgin conceive a child?  He said no.  I told Shimon, in the natural, she could not.  But in the supernatural, God can do anything.  So we can see in this Bible verse, that it is a supernatural sign, that a virgin will conceive, and the son she shall conceive is God, and she shall call his name Immanuel.  Shimon then turned to me and said, If this is true, it means that the rabbis have hidden the Messiah from us.  It was supernatural.  The Holy Spirit was working.  At that moment, something supernatural happened.  Shimon then asked, Can I see more Bible verses?  He was hungry for the truth.  It was supernatural.  Amos 8.11 The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will send a famine on the land, not a famine of bread, nor of thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.  Shimon wanted more of the written word of God.  We began studying for hours Isaiah 53, Psalms 22, Jeremiah 23, and many other Bible passages.  He knew the truth, but he wanted to see if I would proclaim it.  He asked me, who is this Messiah?  Yeshua, Jesus, who died on the tree on the cross for your sins, rose on the third day, and by his blood, if you repent and believe, you have full redemption of sins and eternal life.  This is what Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri knew, this was his revelation, and this is what the rabbis, the Sanhedrin movement, have been suppressing for thousands of years.  But now it's time for the truth to go forth.  Now it's time for everything to be exposed.  The Bible is true.  Ecclesiastics chapter 12, verse 14.  For God will bring every deed into judgment with every secret thing, whether good or evil.  Shimon said, This is a lot for me to grasp.  But I can't deny the Bible verses.  I can't deny Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri's revelation.  I can't deny everything we studied here in the past couple of hours.  And in a way, I'm very upset that the rabbis have been hiding this from us.  We agreed to continue to meet online and in person.  We shook hands and I prayed for him, for revelation in the name of Yeshua, Jesus.  We pray that Shimon and all those that heard the gospel would have visitations, would have visions, and that the Holy Spirit will open their eyes to the truth that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  And only through him is there eternal life and salvation.  The evil motivation of the Sanhedrin is backfiring on them.  We are living in revival.  We are living in salvations.  We are living at a time where the gospel is going forth.  We will continue to preach the gospel.  Until all Israel shall be saved.  Romans 11.26 and we will not keep silent.  Isaiah chapter 62 verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And the word in Hebrew for salvation is Jesus, Yeshua.  In Hebrew it reads like this, Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Al Yehuda, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  former israeli prime minister ariel sharon has died aged eight.  we are with one of rabbi kaduri's disciples. ",
