Can't shove a microphone in Shemima Begum's face quick enough to let her plead her case.  Sees severed heads in bins?  Meh.  Gets UK citizenship revoked?  Shocked!  Shemima, I'mma join ISIS, lol.  UK government?  No more citizenship.  Shemima, what?  And of course it was just a harmless teenage mistake to join an Islamic death cult that drowns people en masse and beheads children.  Just a harmless mistake.  We've all been there.  We've all done it.  No!  A harmless teenage indiscretion is being caught smoking behind the bike shed.  It's topping up your parents' spirits bottles with water.  It's not travelling to a war-torn shithole to join the most barbaric, bloodthirsty, rapacious hordes into the days of Genghis Khan.  It's not enthusiastically throwing your support behind a group that throws gay people off and then waving your hand dismissively at the sight of decapitated heads in bins.  That ain't it, chief.  But it's not just the British media prostrating itself as a platform for wannabe terrorists.  ABC News says former ISIS member Hoda Muthana is full of regret.  She's begging to come home.  Poor thing.  It's also interesting to observe how the same Twitter mobs who habitually destroy people's lives for the most irrelevant minutia suddenly come over all sympathetic and protective when it comes to literal ISIS terrorists.  Wore a Chinese dress to prom.  We must destroy this person's life completely!  Willingly joined ISIS.  We gotta hear this heartbreaking story.  Everyone deserves a second chance.

Where was your sympathy for the Kurdish women who suffered under brutal ISIS occupation?  Left-wing Twitter says we should instantly forgive someone for joining ISIS.  That 48-year-old John Wayne interview where he used a gay slur, though?  Dig up his long-dead corpse and make him apologize.  Now!  But I'm sure Begum is sincere when she says she wants to return to Britain and live in peace.  And you can tell that sentiment is genuine by the name she chose to give her newborn baby.  At the behest of her terrorist husband, she named him after a jihadi warlord infamous for massacring Jews and slaughtering infidels.  So peaceful.  So Shamima Begum is nothing to do with Bangladesh, despite being of Bangladeshi heritage and born to a Bangladeshi mother because she was born on British soil.  Her baby that was born in Syria, though?  Oh, he's totally British.  He's as British as fish and chips.  Come on in.  But don't worry, because if she is eventually allowed back in, authorities have promised us... that she'll be spoken to.  Meanwhile, British citizens get harsher treatment for criticizing transgenderism on social media.  But isn't it worth the risk of having her back?  After all, you're not against diversity, are you?  I mean, let's just forget the fact that three times more British Muslims joined ISIS than joined the British Army.  I was told diversity was a strength.  West Yorkshire police certainly think so.

The Islamic grooming gang paedophiles who operated for seven years without being caught by West Yorkshire police, who trafficked, raped and abused girls as young as 11, not so diverse.  As Brendan O'Neill writes, the progressive elite sympathy offensive on behalf of Begum betrays the fact that they've wedded themselves to the multicultural mantra at any cost.  Even if that means literally welcoming back into the country ISIS militants and their supporters.  She is cleverly exploiting a culture that she knows full well exists in modern Britain, writes O'Neill.  A culture of reluctance when it comes to criticizing hardcore Islamists too harshly and a tendency to feel a cloying racially tinged pity for any Muslim who falls in with Bad people.  Begum is tapping into and seeking to utilise the UK cultural elite's caginess about condemning Islamic extremism, and this is likely to reap benefits for her. ",

The Royal Navy rescued Salman Abadi from Libya and brought him back into the UK three years before he carried out the Manchester bombing.  Let's not make that mistake again because the cost is too horrific to even consider.  And anyway, if Shamima Begum had wanted to be part of a radical extremist group that hates Jews and attacks anyone who disagrees with their warped ideology, she could have just joined the Labour Party.
