            "text": "Grabbed some pizza and then I swing by Staples and I buy this huge, huge plastic bag of those styrofoam packing peanuts.  And this soldier's like, what do you need those for, Soren Pop?  I'm like, oh, you'll see.  Don't worry about it.  Hello everybody, Terrence Pop here with another episode.  Live from the lair!  Ha ha!  All righty, so this is what we got going on here.  Just putting this out there that we're going to be starting up some live chats here at Ridonculous.  I'm trying to put together a comedy skit or comedy show for everyone at least once a month on top of some other live chats.  so I can start blowing this channel fucking up because it needs to happen, gentlemen.  Alright, so where do we leave off with?  I'm in Southfield, Michigan at the 414th Civil Affairs Battalion.  We just got past the skeleton crew phase and we're starting the build up.  Now, Lieutenant D, I think he was promoted to Captain by then, I'm not sure, he pulled some strings and got me an MOS reclass for Intel Analyst.  Now, up until that point, you know, I'd been in 18 Bravo and 11 Bravo.  And that's about it.  You know, 11 Bravo 4 Victor, Airborne Ranger, you know, so I was venturing out of the combat MOSs and into the Intel Weenie MOS.  Because he wanted me to take over the S2 position, which I was already doing, but I just wasn't school trained.  And, you know, it worked out pretty good.  I remember I got the orders, you know, and I went down there to go do it.  You know, the whole divorce thing was just at the tail end of being complete.  You know, my mind was in a very, very dark fucking place.  And I remember I landed in the airport out there, and it was in Utah.  It was some National Guard base out in Utah.  And it always smelled like pig shit.  It was horrible.  But, you know, you get used to it.  You get used to anything, you know, given enough time.  And I remember I landed like 11.15 at night.  We were supposed to be there by 7  p.m.,  but shit got fucked up.  I think my flight was delayed.  There was another soldier there.  And, you know, I had a rental car on my orders.  So I remember going to the rental car counter and... Of course, they didn't have the compact or subcompact that I was supposed to have.  So they gave me a Lincoln Town Car for the same price.  And I got a GPS.  So this NCO, I wish I could remember his name.  I probably have it written down somewhere.  I drove him on post.  We went and saw the CQ, and basically anyone who's been to any military school, that report time that you have on your orders is kind of like a strong suggestion because shit happens in the real world.  There's weather, there's fucking all kinds of labor problems, just problems in general which cause flights to get all fucked up.  What are you going to do?  They bitched a little bit, and they assigned us a room, and this guy wound up being my roommate for the duration of the rest of the school, which worked out because he was also a former grunt.  He was 11 Bravo, and... I've always got along with 11 Bravos and 0311s because we speak grunt speak.  There isn't any kind of, you know, you don't need an interpreter.  When you're around grunts, you don't have to talk that much.  You can just grunt.  It's true.  I'm like, uh, uh.  That means, you know, get the fuck over here.  Or, that means, I don't want to hear it right now.  Or, that's a surprise.  There's a surprise grunt right there.  You know, it's just how it is.  You know, he and I always had the fridge full of beer.  We got yelled at a couple times by the cadre.  But, you know, I'm a fucking senior E7, you know, two CIBs and the whole fucking deal.  And I'm just like, oh, yeah.  Roger.  Too much beer.  Got it.  How much am I allowed?  Okay, can I just drink it down right now and then just keep it at that level?  And they're just like, just stop it, Pop.  And I remember the first day, I show up for the class the next morning.  And I walk in there, and the instructor is a, I think it was an E7 as well, And he looks at me and goes, thank God you're here.  And I'm like, well, son, what the fuck are you talking about?  I'm just a dude, man.  He goes, no, no, no, no, no.  You're the guy who's been on the ground.  You've executed a lot of the harebrained fucking shit that we come up with.  And the reason we come up with all that harebrained shit is there isn't people like you up here going, hey, you see those contour lines?  See how close they are?  Yeah, you're asking these people to walk north and then fall off a fucking cliff 200 feet and then continue on their mission.  Now, he's just like, you know how to do that stuff.  You've walked the ground.  You've walked the marshes, the intermittent streams, such are real streams, the whole deal, the bogs, the lakes.  And I'm like, okay, cool.  So at least I had a leg up.  And they made me the class first sergeant, the admin first sergeant.  So when students had a problem, they would come talk to me before they would talk to the cadre, and then I would take care of it.  So for the most part, They only had to deal with me, the cadre had to deal with me.  in regards to the other, I think we had 38 people in the class.  I think two or three of them got washed out in the first phase and two more in the second phase.  So I think we graduated, I think, 30?  Yeah, something like 30, 32.  It was pretty good.  I did fairly well.  I think my GPA was like a 93, which is good enough for government work.  I'm more like an 85, 82 to 92 guy.  The B answer works pretty much every time.  Or you give the excuse or just say, hey, I got a fucking 82%.  It's good enough for government work.  Yeah, and then we'd learned all those goddamn symbols of all of the different type of units that they track.  The armor, the infantry, airborne infantry, motorized infantry, artillery, mortars.  I mean, the whole deal.  Everything has got this little wacky symbol, and you have to hand-draw them all.  Okay, you can do it on a computer, but for this class, we had to learn what the symbols were, and how you annotate the symbols and mark them correctly, and you had to draw them on the maps.  And then we went through all of the MTOs of the Russian Army, which really doesn't exist anymore, and the Chinese Army, which... probably is completely different now.  We also went through the MTO of France, England, and Germany.  And you read through them, and you skim through and you look for the equipment that has been reported, And, you know, depending upon what their report is, like for instance, they report in, you know, a desalinator.  Okay, that's an engineering unit.  That's a sustainment engineering unit.  And you go to the MTO, you look for the engineer sustainment units and you see what they're attached to.  And then you look through the insums more and you count the tanks and the artillery and, you know, all the other stuff that you see.  And a lot of times you can pretty much guess what's operating out in front of your sector, you know, in the conventional Army world.  You know, is it a brigade, division, a corps?  You know, they always... They always have their specific amount of equipment and tactics that they're going to do when they're aligned in certain ways that you can use to basically guess what's going to happen next.  You write your report, you send it up the chain to the 30-pound brain motherfuckers who warm seats and don't do shit, but they get good awards and they don't do anything with it usually.  Or it's half-assed and done.  But hey, you're doing your job.  I thought that was pretty interesting.  how I saw how the whole thing worked.  You know, and then we went through the SCIF procedures and all of the regs in regards to OBSAC and maintaining security, you know, secret stuff.  And you cover this, I covered a lot of this in Security Manager too, so it was kind of like, you know, just doing it over.  I really didn't have to study that hard because I already knew it, number one.  Number two is open book.  Open book's easy, especially when it's all PDF and you can do find and replace.  so we did that a lot and then uh... went out of town a couple times.  you know utah is a mormon state so it's really not much going on.  i think we saw a couple movies grabbed some dinner and stuff that's about it.  other than that the school went well.  i graduated.  Yeah, we did PT every day.  It wasn't that big of a deal.  The stink, like I said before, it smelled like pig shit all the time.  That really bothered me a lot.  Alright, now, while I was in the school, and I was in a bad frame of mind, I'd get out of class, go back to my room, have my roommate in there.  I'd go through what we covered during the day, read any source material I needed to read.  And then I would write my book of evil.  And let me tell you what.  Writing the book of evil scared the living shit out of me.  Because I realized just how fucking dangerous I am.  Literally.  It was just insane.  The plots I was coming up with and the ways to destroy people's lives or kill people.  It was scary.  It was really scary.  I'll never publish that book, but... I did incorporate a lot of the scenarios and a lot of the tricks into my Jericho Files book, which will probably be coming out here shortly.  That's a fiction book about a retired military officer who used to work for the Stargate program as a remote viewer and didn't really like his retirement very well and decided to use his psychic abilities to hunt down serial killers.  You know, there's a lot of supernatural shit in there.  Ghosts, shades, shadows, inhumans, some magic.  That comes later.  A lot of gore.  It's like gore porn.  You know, a lot of people get smoked.  And I explain it explicitly, you know, how he does it.  Mercilessly.  And when you read the story, you'll realize... Why he's so merciless?  Because the people he's putting to the sword are absolute fucking scumbags.  Just serial killing motherfuckers.  You know, sadistic bastards.  And they so richly have it coming.  And one of the motivations for writing the book is... I remember when I was a kid, I went to the post office.  And the entire wall was pictures of people who were missing.  And then over here, they had a small little area for people who were on the most wanted list.  And there were people on that wall missing.  They had been missing for years.  And people fall through the cracks.  And they never find these people because they were probably killed and buried somewhere and nobody ever knows what's going on.  So I'm like, you know what, it'd be really cool if the universe balanced this shit out, and there was some fucking dude walking around out there that nobody really knew about.  that was hunting these motherfuckers down, that was doing all this shit, because I find it hard to believe that the universe doesn't really have any justice like that.  And so, in my sick, twisted mind over the years, I basically wrote six or eight books, and I've written three of them, And I have the other two or three outlined.  So once I start writing again, I should probably be able to bang out between two and six books a year.  Hopefully you guys like that kind of stuff.  You know, it's kind of therapy to me.  And I don't know, just more shit than I do.  All right, practical jokes.  I love me.  some practical jokes.  All right, this particular guy, supply guy, bought himself one of those fancy Jeeps.  You know, had the moonroof, all of the bells and whistles, all the buttons and bells, whatever.  Kind of getting bored.  We were having issues, you know, with command.  You know, pressure was kind of up there.  So I had a guy, he came in RSTing.  And what that is, RST is you just, you miss a drill, you come in like the following week and make up the days during the week.  So he comes in.  He's attaching me at the hip.  We're doing all our shit during the day.  And it's lunchtime.  I tell him to get in my car.  We're going to grab some pizza.  And then I swing by Staples.  And I buy this huge, huge plastic bag of those styrofoam packing peanuts.  And this soldier's like, what do you need those for, Storm Pop?  I'm like, oh, you'll see.  Don't worry about it.  Throw them in my back seat.  Drive back to the unit.  Pull up right next to the Jeep.  It's a nice, warm summer day.  The sunroof is open.  I take out the bag of packing peanuts.  And I fill this car up, man.  I fill it up like halfway up on the driver's window.  And then I just put the bag back in my car and park it like 50 or 60 feet away.  And then we're up there at the end of the day watching the supply guy go to his car.  And I remember I'm drinking this Pepsi and the soldier's next to me just laughing his ass off.  He goes, is that what you guys do here?  You work full time?  You just fuck with each other?  I'm like, it's for our own good.  Go fucking crazy if you don't do this.  So the supply guy comes out.  He's just going crazy.  He's just mad as hell.  Opens his door and this wave of packing peanuts come down into the parking lot.  He jumps in, drives off.  The moonroof is still down, so it looks like he's in a popcorn machine.  Oh my god, that was fucking hilarious.  Yeah, he must have been fucking mad as fuck, but that's just the way it goes.  There's some other practical jokes I did in there too, but I think we're going to have to go to the next video for those, man.  I'll talk to you later.  ... ... ",
