So, you know, the funny thing is I actually work as a full-time Baptist preacher, and we started a church in Nairobi right next to a Jehovah's Witness kingdom hall.  and actually converted almost 90% of those people out of that.  And so it is, I'm just telling you guys, it's a false religion.  Jesus Christ is God in the flesh.  He is the Savior of man.  He is Emmanuel.  He is God incarnate.  Before Abraham was, I am.  He is the I am of the Old Testament.  He is the Jehovah of the Old Testament.  And so that's what I want you guys to know. ",
