            "text": "Hi there, it's your girl Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video I'm going to do something I never thought I would do.  Show the inside of my mouth to the internet.  This is something that I feel will be really beneficial for a lot of you out there who aren't so interested in the information but who still want to feminize their voice.  So let's take a look.  Alright, so first off, to feminize the voice, you have to raise your first resonance.  The first resonance is inversely related to the size of the throat.  So if the throat is very big, then the value of it will be very low in your sound.  And if the space of the throat is very tiny, then the R1 goes higher.  Now, in order to raise R1, we do several things.  We retract the root of the tongue, we elevate the root of the tongue, we squeeze the oropharynx and the larynx also raises, okay?  So I'm gonna show you now what that looks like when it occurs.  The two biggest things that you need to look for are one, the walls of my throat doing this, okay?  That is your oropharyngeal closure and it's very important to sounding female.  And then you'll also see that once I add the rest of the technique, the tongue actually elevates and comes back like that, okay?  So let's go ahead and look.  Ah, ah, heat from fire.  Now here's what it looks like when I do oropharyngeal closure by itself.  Oh, ah, oh, ah.  Now notice how the tongue then elevates after that.  Ah, heat from fire.  All right, so in full, voice feminization should look kind of like this.  Ah, ah, heat from fire.  And then I sound like that, okay?  And all I'm doing is maintaining something similar to that in the back of my mouth while I'm talking.  And that's what makes you sound female, because that space back there is being decreased by all of these techniques.  And as the space decreases, the resonances climb higher, which make you sound female, okay?  I hope this video is helpful for you all.
