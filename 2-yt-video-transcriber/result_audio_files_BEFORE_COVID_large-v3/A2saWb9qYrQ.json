            "text": "Here's my friends.  I've been telling you for all the time that Donald Trump's been in the White House that Barack Obama is still the president of the  U.S.,  still runs things a mile away from the White House in his huge mansion, his bunker that he built, has all of his old staff basically there with him running things.  I guarantee you they're pulling Pelosi, Schumer, everybody's strings, all of them.  Even the new people in Congress, Obama pulls their strings.  He's pulling strings of world leaders all around the globe.  But I got something that just went under the wire and it went shoof over most people's heads.  It just happened.  And this is something that shows, without a doubt, in my humble opinion, it shows without a doubt that Barack Hussein Obama is still the de facto president of the United States, not Donald Trump, Barack Obama.  And I'm going to prove it to you.  And you can believe what you want to believe.  If you can hear what I'm going to tell you and still don't understand the significance of this and that this proves that Obama is still running the country, then believe what you want to believe.  This is amazing.  For the last 154 years, since President Andrew Johnson in 1865, August 30th of 1865 to be exact, when he welcomed in the Brooklyn Athletics and Washington Nationals baseball teams to the White House, every single championship team, college and pros, have come to the White House to see the President of the United States.  They haven't gone to see anyone else but the President of the United States.  The Golden State Warriors World Championship basketball team just came to D.C.  They didn't go to see President Trump.  They went to see President Barack Hussein Obama at his mansion, his office, his mansion.  I'm off in the White House.  It had a big party, a big get-together, a big whoop-de-doo right there at Obama's crib.  Okay?  That's how it went down.  That's how it happened.  They went to see President Obama.  Not President Trump.  President Obama.  This is the first time ever In the history of this once great nation, that the team has gone somewhere else other than the White House, gone to an actual former president who's actually the acting president?  because only acting presidents have hosted championship teams.  This is total new precedent, my friends.  People just can't see it.  They can't see who Obama is.  They can't see what he is.  He's the future Antichrist, my friends.  He's the guy that's going to run this entire planet soon.  After the rapture of Christ, rapture of the bride of Christ gets taken out here imminently.  Obama's going to run the show.  It's going to be his house with Pope Francis as his number two man, his sidekick, the false prophet.  It's unbelievable.  It's just amazing.  Amazing.  And people can't see this.  It went right over their heads.  Right under the radar.  I saw it.  I see it.  And I'm putting it down.  It's happened a couple days ago.  And again, I've got to put out the main meat and potatoes, big end time stuff.  I decide things like this and when I can, this is still huge because it shows who this man is.  This is the bottom line.  It's a Christian channel here.  Jesus Christ is your only hope.  If you don't want to be stuck here soon after the rapture for seven periods of hell on earth where billions upon billions upon billions of people die the most grotesque, awful, terrible, horrific death imaginable to man, you need to find Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior right now.  If you're a backslidden Christian, you need to repent.  They don't think you need to.  The hundreds of scriptures say you have to.  Repentance does not work.  It's a separate mandate.  Believe what you want to believe.  I'll tell you what the Bible says.  I've got a prayer and six final next steps in the box below the video.  Pray it.  Do the steps as soon as possible.  No one's guaranteed any more time in your life.  If you'd like prayer for anything, contact me.  I pray for you every day without fail.  True Christians, witness and pray for the lost daily.  It's your job.  I love everyone out there.  I don't want to see anyone end up being left behind and going to hell.  I want you all to go to heaven soon in the imminent rapture.  Be ready.  If you'd like prayer for anything, contact me.  I pray for you every day without fail.  Share this video.  and true Christians, look up.  Our addiction draweth nigh.  We fly soon.  May God bless you all.  Take care of yourselves.  And please wake up and see what's going on.  It's amazing.  Bye. ",
