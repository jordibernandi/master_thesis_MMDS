            "text": "Oh.  Oh, hey, y'all.  Sorry, I'm just... Well, I'm not doing real good right now, to be honest with you.  This last scandal of ours, it's rocked me to my core.  You know, the one with all those rich people scamming and bribing to get their kids in the best programs and best schools.  You know, I just... Look, man.  I grew up dirt poor in rural America, and me and the other trailer babies, we didn't have much, but one thing we did have was a shared understanding, all of us.  We understood that no matter how else things looked in this country, how things were going, there was always at least one group of people in this country who were out there doing it right.  setting the standard for all of us, whether it be academically, athletically, humanitarianism, whatever, you name it, they were setting the bar.  They were doing it the right way.  If there was one group that represented the best of us, it was rich white children.  And now, well, now I don't even know what to believe anymore.  Yeah, man, I can remember growing up Me and my trash pals, we'd go down the mud fields, play our poop games, you know, and it didn't matter who won or lost or anything like that.  Every time, no matter what, before we'd all go home, you know, go home to our canned meats and our 13 dogs, we'd always get to talking every time about our heroes.  You know, other kids in other places, they got, you know, Michael Jordans or Spider-Mans or whatever.  But for us, the true heroes were rich white children.  And we'd talk about them.  And none of us had ever met one.  We knew we never would.  They go to Harvard, we go to truck college.  It's the way things work, and that's fine.  We didn't need to meet any.  It was enough for us just to know that they were out there.  excelling.  They were excelling at throwing things off a speedboat or spitefully playing the violin or perfecting the exact distance to be from an African child when you take a selfie with it.  Either way, they were doing it right.  To find out that, you know, maybe they weren't and maybe rich kids weren't objectively better and smarter and just greater than us that actually, maybe, I guess, they got where they were simply because their parents were wealthy and influential.  It just doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense, but apparently it's true.  And I don't know, it's tough.  If there's one thing we could take solace in, it's knowing that this is not all of our rich people, okay?  We still have some heroes out there.  This is just a collection of bad apples, really.  I mean, and if you think about it, relative to the truly wealthy and elite in this country, the people in this scandal, basically plumbers, most of the truly wealthy and elite in this country, this isn't gonna change anything for them, guys.  It's not gonna change anything.  Don't worry.  They're still gonna be out there, okay?  They're still gonna be pulling the strings.  They're still gonna be thinking for us, deciding things for us.  okay, running things for us, because we need them to do that, and they're still gonna step up to the plate and do it, this little scandal doesn't change anything about the way the world works for them or us, okay, nothing, trust me, I hope you believe me when I say that, because I know it to be true, this changes nothing, all right, love y'all, see you later.
