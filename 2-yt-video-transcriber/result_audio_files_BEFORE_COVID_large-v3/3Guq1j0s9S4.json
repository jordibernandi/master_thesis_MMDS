            "text": "Solipsism is the idea that the only thing that I can be sure of is the existence of my own mind.  So anything outside of my own mind, including the material world, but also including all other minds, can be called into doubt.  No other minds can be known, and so they may not in fact exist.  Essentially, solipsism is the idea that I can only ever know my mind and I may be the only mind that exists.  Your mental state is completely private and unobservable to anyone else, so all you can be sure of is your own thoughts and own ideas and own mind.  you cannot definitively say anything else exists and this includes other thinking beings.  it is known as the problem of other minds.  as we can only be sure we exist we cannot be sure of anything else.  We can doubt the existence of all other minds.  Every other person in our lives can be what is known as a philosophical zombie.  On the outside they are indistinguishable from a normal human being, but inside they lack conscious experience and sentience.  so i can stab my hand i feel pain and i scream.  i then see someone else stab their hand and then scream.  but there is a huge bit of data missing for me namely the sensation of pain.  i have no idea that the other person felt this pain or felt anything.  It could just be a simple input-output.  The zombie stabbed the hand and the zombie screamed, but no feeling or sensation actually took place.  Whatever was felt will never be known by me.  It can never be known by me so I have no evidence to suppose it exists.  I then have every reason to doubt it exists.  It could be that I am the only being that feels, that thinks, that is conscious.  I am the only mind that exists. ",
