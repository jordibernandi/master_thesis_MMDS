I want you to see one of the clips at the end of this movie.  You guys need to go see it.  They're talking about you.  End of this movie, Thor didn't want to rule anymore, so he gave Asgard to a sister.  And in this clip you're about to see Captain America passes his shield to the brother Falcon.  And you need to listen what he's going to tell it.  Now, this is just amazing to me because the same people who's over there in one part of our land claiming to be us and the same people who run Hollywood are the same people.  So they're telling the truth over there in Hollywood.  But over here on the other side of the earth, they're running the biggest sham you've ever seen in your life.  So check this out.  And wake up, brothers and sisters.  Our rulership of planet earth is on its way.  And they're telling you in the movies.  Shalom.  Go ahead. ",
