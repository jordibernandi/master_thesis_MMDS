            "text": "We are cynics today.  We don't believe.  But The belief is in our acts, in our activity.  The fetishist illusion is not in our mind.  In our mind, we know there is nothing magic about money.  Money just gives us access to part of the social product and so on and so on.  The illusion is in what we do, how we act in our social life, participating in the market exchange and so on and so on.  If you allow me to repeat an old joke of mine, which I think only in the United States I used, I would say, between 40 and 50 times, but it's too perfect not to use it.  I'm sorry if you know it.  It's a well-known... Sorry, I have nervous tics and so on.  It's a wonderful joke about Niels Bohr, you know, the Copenhagen guy.  He had a house in the countryside, an old house to retreat... in his holidays, for holidays and free weekends, and there, above the entrance to the house, was a horseshoe.  I don't know how it is with you, but in Europe, a horseshoe is a superstitious sign.  The idea is that it keeps the evil spirits from entering the house.  So that's the anecdote.  A friend visited him, a fellow scientist, and asked him, but wait a minute, you are a scientist.  Why do you have this bullshit there?  You know, like, do you believe in it?  Niels Bohr answers, my God, I'm not an idiot, of course, I don't believe in it, I'm a scientist.  Then the friend insists, but why do you have it there?  I hope you know the brilliant answer.  I have it there because although I don't believe in it, I was told that it works even if you don't believe in it.  That's ideology today.  Nobody has to believe.  Trump doesn't believe and so on.  The illusion is in our acts.  And I'm so sorry I don't have time to go in detail here because... A whole theory of ideology can be developed from this based on what I think is maybe the single greatest achievement, contribution of American, by this I mean United States culture to world civilization, at least in the 20th century.  On your TV shows, you know this scant laughter.  Laughter is part of the soundtrack.  Can you imagine what a magic, wonderful mechanism this is?  Be careful and observe how it works.  Those primitive behaviorists are totally wrong, those who claim, oh, it's simply to automatically trigger your laughter.  No, I read a good empirical analysis which claims over 90% of people do not laugh.  But it has this wonderful magic effect, at least, okay, maybe I'm an idiot with me.  I come home in the evening, tired, I look at it, some stupid show, cheers, whatever, friends, and the TV set laughs for me, and at the end I am relaxed as if I have laughed.  It's a wonderful mechanism that we know from so-called primitive societies.  You know, from Tibet, I was always fascinated by those praying wheels.  You know, you write your prayer onto a piece of paper, you put it in, you turn it around, and then it doesn't matter.  You can think about sex, whatever.  Objectively, you are praying.  But they were maybe not so primitive.  We are doing exactly the same thing.  And again, the parallel between this and Marx is exactly in this displacement how you can believe without believing.  Subjectively you can not believe, but objectively in your activity you believe.  I think we should not underestimate the extent to which these functions today.  People know that our votes are manipulated, that our justice is corrupted.  Nonetheless, you act as if you believe in it.  And what fascinated me already when I was young, still living in a communist country, a relatively liberal one, but still a communist country, to what extent, at least in the last two decades of communism in ex-Yugoslavia, not believing in the official ideology was not only no problem, they didn't care if you believe it or not, they went a step further.  And they even considered, if they detected that you take seriously the Yugoslav communist ideology, that we have a specific self-management socialism which is much better than Soviet bureaucratic socialism, It was considered dangerous to take it seriously.  The idea was if you take it seriously, you will soon notice that things are not really like that.  The idea is taking the official ideology seriously is the first step towards dissidence.  So the idea was, it's a wonderful example of an ideology which worked on condition that it was not taken seriously. ",
