            "text": "I'm Cabot Phillips with Campus Reform.  Today we're going to be asking students for their opinion on the policy of deporting people that are illegally here and have broken the law.  We're going to be reading them a quote in support of that policy, but what they don't know is the quote is actually President Obama's from 2014.  Will that change their opinion?  Let's find out.  Donald Trump announced this past week that he would be urging ICE and other administration authorities to seek out people living here illegally that had broken the law to deport them.  I have a quote for you here that's been making the rounds on social media about the deportation of criminal illegal aliens.  We are a nation of laws.  Undocumented workers broke our laws, and I believe they must be held accountable, especially those who may be dangerous.  That's why over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80%, and we're going to keep focusing on threats to our security.  What's your thought on that quote and that policy in general?  I think that policy comes from a place of white American nationalism.  Donald Trump has kind of embraced this rhetoric of racism and xenophobia.  that is not beneficial to our country at all.  I don't think that quote really stands true.  This administration has totally not done anything moral.  This is really awful.  Amnesty does not necessarily mean that we're losing border security.  I think that Trump feels that way.  I think that's a bad decision because the United States should be open to immigrants.  They call it land with a free for a reason.  We just have to advocate for those kinds of people and people in Congress like Ocasio-Cortez who is helping people overcome these kinds of things.  Crimes do not nullify your humanity and people are coming here in search of opportunity.  I'm going to show you the person who said that quote.  You're also a nation of loss.  Undocumented workers.  Is that surprising?  Yeah, a little bit.  Why is that surprising?  Because I thought it was the Trump administration that said something like that.  Yeah, it's quite surprising.  I thought it was from Trump.  I didn't expect it to be Obama either.  Why did you not expect it to be Obama?  Because... I just, I guess, I don't know.  Like, it just never, it never occurred to me that it could be Obama.  Is that surprising that it's a quote from President Obama?  Yeah, that was surprising for sure, yeah.  Do you think it's still a practice of white nationalism, though, to deport criminal legal aliens?  I think the way Trump's doing it, it is.  Okay.  What, but President Obama, to this, to this point in Trump's presidency, Obama actually deported more people, though.  So it's, in practice, it was more from Obama, though.  What's your question?  I'd say my understanding of Obama versus Trump is that just that Obama was more liberal as far as amnesty and border security.  I expected that quote to come from Trump.  I mean, it just shows the hypocrisy in politics.  One person can say something five years ago, and next thing you know, it doesn't apply to them anymore, and that they can now be the... morality police for whoever is in charge now.  Does that change your opinion of the practice to know that President Obama did the same thing?  Actually, to this point in his presidency, deported more people than President Trump had at this point.  No.  Again, I just think that there's a moral way to do it.  And I don't know a ton about Obama's deportation policies, but I imagine that they were a lot more humane than the ones currently going on.  Oh, well, hello there.
