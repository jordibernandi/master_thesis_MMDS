            "text": "When Harper was Prime Minister, the Toronto Zoo split up a gay penguin couple.  Yeah, Buddy and Pedro, those were their names, you guys.  Buddy and Pedro, the first gay Latino Jewish penguin love story.  Just end it, you know?  Just let the penguins be gay, right?  Like, what is Canada if not a country that celebrates multicultural gay penguin love?  That's who we are.  Justin Trudeau would never have allowed that.  He would have gone down to the zoo and officiated their wedding for sure, you know?  Here's the thing.  We have a prime minister who is a sex symbol.  And that's why it is so hard for me to understand, maybe you guys will be outraged by this, because I am, that Canadian is not a category of porn.  We're not a fetish group.  How is that possible?  Look at us, you know?  Look at this guy.  Come on, you know?  And there's a category for everything in porn.  Specific nationalities, even.  Czech porn.  Someone knows about it.  Czech porn.  Czech porn.  That's a category, right?  Not like Czechoslovakian porn, because who wants to see any Cold War-era porn?  That's... What is that, even just a bunch of people banging in line while they wait for bread?  I don't know.  But the CRTC has our back because they issued a notice against three Canadian porn channels for not broadcasting enough Canadian porn.  That is an absolutely true story, something that happened with our tax money.  And I can't believe that there is someone out there I'm assuming a man who has a job of watching porn to decide whether it's Canadian enough.  I've decided to apply for this job.  So I've come up with a list of Canadian porn titles I wanted to test out on you.  Are you guys ready?  Okay, Canadian porn titles.  Number one, Poutine It In.  Right?  That's a good one.  Milfs in the hall.  Not bad.  Uh, Zamboners 3.  Two minutes in the box.  Yeah?  Okay.  Inuk shook you all night long.  And sexy nurses paid for by the government.  Thank you, guys.  You've been amazing.  Have a good night. ",
