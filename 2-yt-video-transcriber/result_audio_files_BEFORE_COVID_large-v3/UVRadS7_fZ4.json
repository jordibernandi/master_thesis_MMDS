See, in America, every damn day, every damn day, on the world stage, they're always showing our Kings in the worst light.  They always showing them shackled down, bound down.  You know, we see tons of black men in mug shots.  You're not going to see it over here at all.  No, you're not.  Cause I'm showing our Kings in the most beautiful light, the most, most divine light.  Look at our brothers.  I mean, Oh, y'all are so handsome, beautiful to look at.  But, um, They love fucking with y'all.  I mean, look at your bodies.  Oh, Lord have mercy.  Let me get up off of here.  But I'm serious about what I'm going to show y'all because I'm pissed.  I'm fucking pissed because what I'm going to show the royal family is what I would call a contradiction.  and yes that title I know that title might be throwing you off but y'all see where I'm coming from because I rarely do local stories and when I caught sight of this today because I wasn't aware of it because I don't watch too much local news up here in the Bay Area I was like really fuck that fuck that.  where is the hypervia?  where is the anger?  you notice that they have what we call selective Fake rage.  Because anytime they see our black men break a fucking fingernail, it's time to go in.  You see what they're doing right now on the media.  They got some black men up there.  I don't have to name that particular black man.  It's a black man every damn day.  So, anytime our royal family, anytime we see the enemy doing something, put a whole lot on it. ",

You'd often see him here at the ballpark where there's a game tonight, but now he can't return to the Giants until the 1st of July.  WHILE ORACLE PARK GETS READY FOR THE FINAL EXHIBITION GAME BEFORE OPENING DAY, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL ANNOUNCED THAT SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS PRESIDENT AND CEO LARRY BEAR IS SUSPENDED WITHOUT PAY FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.  MLB COMMISSIONER ROB MANFORD SAID.  HE SPOKE WITH BEAR AND THEN ISSUED THIS STATEMENT.  I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT MR.  BEAR'S CONDUCT WAS UNACCEPTABLE.  I FIND THAT MR.  BEAR SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD.  BECAUSE AS A LEADER, HE IS EXPECTED TO BE A ROLE MODEL FOR OTHERS IN HIS ORGANIZATION AND COMMUNITY.  THE SUSPENSION COMES AFTER THIS PHYSICAL ALTERCATION BETWEEN BEAR AND HIS WIFE PAM EARLIER THIS MONTH IN WHICH HE FELL OFF A CHAIR.  THE INCIDENT WAS CAPTURED ON CELL PHONE VIDEO.  BEAR HAS BEEN ON VOLUNTARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE IN A STATEMENT.  HE SAID, QUOTE, I MADE A SERIOUS MISTAKE.  THAT I SINCERELY REGRET AND I AM TRULY SORRY FOR MY ACTIONS.  MY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR FELL WELL SHORT OF WHAT MUST BE DEMANDED OF EVERY PERSON, PARTICULARLY SOMEONE IN MY POSITION AND ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY.
