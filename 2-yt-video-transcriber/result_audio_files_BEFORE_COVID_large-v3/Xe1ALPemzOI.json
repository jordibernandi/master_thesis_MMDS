And then people want to know why conservatives say that there's a anti-conservative bias at facebook.  well they won't let us take a meeting with anybody but all you have to do is walk in the lobby and see for yourself.  what do you have to do?  The bias in this country is out of control.  I want to know when members of Congress are going to do something about it.  You know, I voted for President Trump.  I supported President Trump since day one.  And at 25 years old, my life is being totally ruined and totally destroyed by people like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, who have tons of money.  These people are billionaires and they have.  acquired so much power through social media.  They have so much information on so many people on this planet to the point where they can now decide whether or not somebody exists.  I think it is disgusting.  I think it is an abomination that two billionaires in Silicon Valley have the power to decide whether or not somebody deserves to have a voice simply because of their politics.  I think it's an abomination.  It really is.  It's truly an abomination.  Can't even come downstairs and talk to me.  It's not like I can get anything on.  I never violated the Facebook terms of service.  You know that?  I never once violated the Facebook terms of service ever.  I never once did anything violent.  I never advocated for violence against anybody.  And yet Mark Zuckerberg has the audacity to defame me on a massive level in front of the entire world by issuing a statement and saying that Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson are dangerous individuals.  What exactly about us is dangerous, Mark?  I would like to know.  Is it the fact that I expose the left?  Is it the fact that I warn people about the horrors and the truth of Sharia law?  What exactly is it that's so dangerous about me?  You know what, Mark?  I'll agree with you.  I guess I am a dangerous individual because my reporting and my existence is dangerous to your left-wing agenda, okay?  It's dangerous to these lying liberals who want to do everything in their power to undermine President Trump and his presidency in our constitutional republic.  So I guess you're right.  I guess you're right.  I guess you're right, Mark.  Facts are pretty dangerous, aren't they?  Facts are pretty dangerous. ",
