            "text": "Hello there and good evening.  Just a short audio only update to say, hold on to your hats guys, we might be on the verge of an early full blown Brexit.  I've just caught a tweet from Daddy Dragon and I'll quote it here direct.  Wow, it is being suggested by a senior Tory that Boris Johnson at 10 Downing Street is preparing to give a consent order to the High Court in relation to the Robin Tilbrook case for leave.  Evidently he can do this under the Crown prerogative as he is named as first respondent.  Now if you remember, after the first Article 50 extension, the chairman of the English Democrats, Robin Tilbrook, lodged a judicial review case with the Administrative Court arguing that the extension itself was unlawful.  And Theresa May's government lodged a defence to protect her decision.  What this news amounts to is Boris Johnson pulling that government defence to the case Robin Tilbrook put into the courts in April this year.  This would mean that the government would be accepting that the first Article 50 extension was unlawfully obtained, so that agreement to extend Article 50 beyond the 29th of March was null and void in domestic and international law.  The upshot would be, if this is true, that the UK left the EU on WTO terms, that is, no deal Brexit, on the 29th of March this year.  This would, as I understand it, become effective immediately.  Boris signed the relevant document and it was received by the court.  Now I assume that there will be an instant court case launched by someone like Gina Miller to try and prove that Boris Johnson acted unlawfully himself by pulling the government defence to this case, but I doubt it would get very far.  Let's just hope this is correct, as it would destroy any moves by Jeremy Corbyn, Joe Swinson, Ian Blackford or even Speaker Bercow to try and stop Brexit, as it would already have happened.
