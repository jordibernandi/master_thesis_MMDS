            "text": "The International Criminal Court is supposed to prosecute perpetrators of the worst types of crimes, like genocide, mass deportation, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  And now at the request of the Palestinian Authority, ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda says she is ready to open an investigation into whether Israel has committed war crimes by building residential communities, which are often called settlements.  This is not a question of whether Jewish settlements in the disputed territories are right or wrong, which is a topic of debate even among Israelis.  Nor is it a question of whether Jews have an ancient history in the region.  They certainly do.  The question is whether building these communities is an illegal war crime.  So, what does the law say?  The Palestinians point to Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits forced population transfers.  Israel has never forced anyone to live in the disputed territories, nor has Israel forced existing populations to leave.  In fact, since Israel came to control the disputed territories in 1967, the Palestinian population has nearly quadrupled.  But this isn't just about technical law.  It's about what's right and wrong.  There are 124 territorial disputes around the world and in exactly none of them is building homes in a disputed territory prosecuted as a war crime.  Not one.  Ever.  Except Israel.  The law actually makes sense.  Land disputes around the world can continue for years, even generations.  During that time, life goes on, and individual people and communities need to be able to live and grow.  Applying a unique law to Israel that you don't apply to any other country is illegal.  But it gets worse.  Palestinians are not asking the court to halt all building activity during this dispute.  Rather, they demand, in effect, that Jews and only Jews stop building homes while Muslims and Christians can continue.  Applying a unique law to Jews that you don't apply to any other people or religion is both illegal and wildly racist.  There are other, more technical problems as well.  For example, as Israel is not a member of the ICC, it is not clear that the court can even apply jurisdiction at all.  Also, in the 1990s, Israel and the Palestinian Authority entered into the Oslo Accords, agreeing to handle this dispute through direct negotiation rather than through international tribunals.  But technicalities aside, the most important thing is that laws must be applied universally to all people, regardless of race, religion, or nationality.  By not dismissing the Palestinian complaint, the ICC is already applying a unique double standard to Jewish people and to the Jewish state.  that it does not apply to any other territorial dispute, such as Russia's occupation of the Ukraine, Turkey's occupation of Cyprus, or Morocco's total takeover of Western Sahara.  My question is, when we start creating unique laws that apply only to Jews, who's next? ",
