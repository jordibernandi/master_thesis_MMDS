            "text": "But you are going to see a very interesting significant table.  This table is really to do with Purim, with Messiah, and Esser Mordechai.  All of them will appear in very significant tables.  If you see yourself, that is far away from being coincidence.  Long sentences, there's meetings, everything which makes the condition for a very significant table.  So what you are seeing here?  So the first thing, once in the Torah, you have a sentence, a very interesting sentence.  You can start from here, from down.  Mashiach imashach, the Messiah will be anointed.  This is here, Messiah will be anointed.  So in red you have it.  Come.  Mashiach imashach will be anointed.  When?  Unbelievable.  In the center you have the date, on the 14th of Aga.  So anybody who knows a little bit, this is exactly the date of Purim.  Purim also appears here, Purim, unbelievable.  Now, what will be then?  He will be anointed, and definitely bring redemption, and you don't know who will be anointed, he may be an angel, you know, but it's amazing.  Then you have also, as we said, Esther and Mordechai.  And Esther has another name also, Hadassah.  So all of them coming here, very, very significant.  Now, what more we have here?  Definitely hoping that the Messiah will bring redemption, as we said, will bring rescue, which we need very much.  And what really... is something which is not usual here, that you have really three dates.  You have the date of this year, 5779.  You have the year of 5776, and you have the year of 5781.  Now one should know, that is not coincident, as Rabbi Berlan said, that really the process of Messiah really started at 5776.  And here, you have this 779, that with every redemption we are the Messiah, but only with repentance.  Only if Jews will keep the Torah, keep the Sabbath, we keep everything which God wants them to keep, the beauty of life and everything, which unfortunately now they don't.  There's a case in the Sabbath, we say unfortunately, against religion, against the Torah.  So then, as Rabbi Berlan said, there is an end of days.  You see, the end of days is 5, 7, 8, 1.  Two entire fields.  Amazing.  This also comes.  So really, we have a very interesting, significant table, as we said.  The process, we started 5, 7, 7, 6.  Now we are in 5, 7, 7, 9.  And then, what the... End of days, if we don't repent, it will be 5, 7, 8, 1.  So let us hope that really Jews will do repentance, will keep the Sabbath, will not desecrate the Sabbath as they really want to do, and keep purity of life and all the other laws of the Torah, and then we'll have Messiah already for this Purim.  Because now in a month's time it will be Purim, yeah?  So, interesting and significant table.  So, what really I wanted to show you in this table, should really watch it properly, because you could see yourself that it is far away from being coincident, because as you saw, Esther, Mordechai, Purim, Hadassah, and Pearsir, which almost never comes in such a way.  And then you have exactly the date of Purim, the 14th of Adah, which is not at all so simple to find.  So, all of them coming here in such a clear way, teach us that by keeping the Torah, keeping the Sabbath, keeping everything that God really wants us to keep, only then we'll have a Messiah.  If not, we'll have to wait, unfortunately, for another almost two years, five, seven, eight, one.  It's an important, significant table for our time. ",
