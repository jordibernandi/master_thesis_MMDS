We've been saying this and you say that school choice is racist.  You are bought and paid for by them.  You just made a case for school choice while saying that you hate school choice.  Question of the day.  Let me ask this.  Do you think too much attention is actually being given to Alexandria Nina Pintas and Maria Cortez?  Or is it pretty clear that the left is headed in a specific direction here, namely socialism?  So leaders like Cortez need to be addressed and their views need to be dissected.  There are a lot of people saying, why are you giving this person all of this attention?  I understand.  I understand that she's just one person.  But I also understand that there are a lot of people who see her as a symbol for the Democratic Party and certainly want the party to go in that direction.  So I'm curious to hear what you guys think. ",

I think we have her tweets right here.  She responded in K-12 education.  mass incarceration, banks targeting black Americans before the housing crisis.  She's been cordially invited to appear on the show, by the way.  Haven't heard back.  As far as I know, here's something important as well.  She's never appeared on a show with an opposing viewpoint.  No.  Ever.  I can't find it.  I've never found it.  We've been doing research all morning.  Please tweet me, leave a comment.  If there's a video of her going on a conservative show, a show that would hold her feet to the fire, or where there'd be any kind of debate, please let me know.  As far as I understand, she exclusively preaches to the convert.  So we're forced to go through a tweet because she wouldn't appear on the show.  And by the way, I was stunned that these were the examples she chose because these are examples that are first year sort of diversity studies, gender studies, take your pick.  I don't know if diversity studies are real gender studies.  It's so new to her.  It's a layup.  It's like a First semester philosophy college student would pick these, and they are some of the most easily debunked.  So as something else, as we go through these, here's something to keep in mind.  Of course, you've all heard correlation doesn't equal causation.  But more importantly here, disparity doesn't equal discrimination.  We'll come back to that later.  So let's go through point one, school funding.  Right away, off the top, schools aren't segregated.  There are no white schools and black schools by law.  So it can't be about race when we're talking about systemic discrimination.  So let's take a look at what could actually be causing the funding disparity.  First of all, if you actually bother to read the WAPO article that she is referencing, she doesn't actually put it in the tweet.  She just says, look it up.  Buy a book, okay?  Look it up.  Get the person knocking on your door at the encyclopedia.  It's just splurge.  You'll find it.  It's real.  Google it.  So you find the disparity, by the way, in the original one.  It has nothing to do with race.  And it has nothing to do with the system.  It's really based on how money is raised from property taxes. ",

Even if you agree with the premise here when you're talking about school funding, you have to follow the logic trail or you have to follow their logic trail that more money would equal better success in school.  That's not true.  Higher per spending pupil does not equate to greater success.  That's a great example where there isn't even a correlation.  You couldn't say the correlation equals causation, but there are schools that have more funding like in Detroit than the national average that do horribly.  And then there are schools.  They have far less funding that do much better.  For example, there are some schools in certain districts of New York where they couldn't understand.  They're going, hold on a second.  They have bigger classroom sizes.  They don't have the same amount of spending per pupil.  And they were doing far better because of better teachers and incentives.

There are some Japanese kamikaze pilots who'd like to speak with you.  Also, by the way, the whitest people on earth, the Aryans, the Nazis, they were meth out of their minds.  It is absolutely true that people who do hardcore drugs, particularly stimulants like crack cocaine and methamphetamine, commit more crimes.  I don't know why.  They're like, it's racism.  No, no.  crash planes into Pearl Harbor when they do those drugs.  That's wise.  To go to the argument at large, because she just said, incarceration.  Yes, black people make up a disproportionate percentage of the prison population.  But they also commit a disproportionate percentage of the crimes.  They commit murder, for example, at more than double the rate of white Americans.  Okay?  And again, if you look more closely, you can find reasons for the disparity in the drug crimes, specifically, that they mention, that don't equal discrimination.  Yes, okay?  Here's a good example.  81% of crack cocaine defendants are black.  But only 2% of meth defendants are black.  Yeah.  With 54% of them being white.  That means that meth laws target whites 27 times more than blacks.  See?  We can play that game too.  Meth targets whites.  I bet if you were to include people who have sex with their sister, it's probably 84 times more than blacks.  By the way, according to the stats, heroin is the wonder drug that bridges the racial divide.  That's just good shit.  Everyone loves heroin.  I don't care you're white, you're yellow.  Heroin is just plain good business.  You got that right. ",

So the third point she makes is that banks are targeting minorities, right?  That banks, Cortez claims that targeted black Americans.  I wouldn't use the word targeting, but okay, let's go with your premise.  There is validity, Ms.  Cortez, to your claim.  Why?  Because of your party.  Here's Cuomo.  Housing agents who say, well, there are no vacancies right now.  that you just didn't qualify for the mortgage because your financial credit history wasn't good enough.  That sounds valid.  Last year, the Federal Reserve Board found African Americans are denied credit for homes at twice the rate white Americans are.  What?  Twice the rate?  That's almost two times more!  Twice the rate, 27 times the rate of prosecution of white Americans for meth.  80, what is it, 80 something times the prosecution of black Americans for crack cocaine.  Twice the rate, let's just use numbers.  Twice the rate, okay?  What was the credit score?  What was the money down?  What was the income?  We can play that game too.  We just want to say that white people got bank home loans at twice the rate, therefore racism.  That's not how you look into statistics.  Your party targeted banks, told them they had to lend to more people of color, regardless of income ability, money down or credit score.  Cuomo himself established the Affordable Housing Goals, which gave Fannie Mae Freddie Mac annual quotas for giving low income mortgages.  I've never understood this predatory, how could banks profit from giving loans to people who couldn't possibly pay them back?  Why would banks target them?  It's like a shark targeting a fish to throw up food in its mouth. ",

            "text": "It was government policies that targeted low-income individuals with these loans and caused the housing crisis.  They required banks to give out loans to people who couldn't pay them back or face the consequences.  A bank is typically in the business of making money!  By the way, you know who didn't have a problem getting a home?  The Black Doctor, just so you know.  That's one thing that they always show in movies.  that's completely inaccurate.  Do you think Ben Carson would walk into a bank and the response would be, well, everything here checks out, but we don't take kindly to your killards around here.  But it's money in the bank.  I'm basically paying 80% down.  We don't care.  We'd rather lose money on a good white feller.  That's what happens in these movies.  A black guy walks in for a bank loan.  He walks in.  He's got a wife and kids.  He's got a job.  He's got a perfect credit score.  He's got all the money down.  And they're like, well, I would give it to you if you weren't a negro.  That's not how it works in the real world.  Are there some racists, by the way?  Of course there are.  But to try and act like the housing crisis was caused by banks targeting black people to make sure that they take the money they could never pay back, it just shows a lack of any threat of logic.  Listen, I'm not saying that there aren't examples of individual racism, of course, but I asked for examples of discrimination, what she gave me and you by proxy.  Here's something else.  two people say, why do you focus on her so much?  She's an elected official.  She is paid by our tax dollars.  It's not punching up, looking to gain ratings.  Her job is to respond to her constituency.  That's her job.  It is entirely appropriate to respectfully ask for her to answer these questions.  She gave examples of discrimination that were actually just disparity.  That's all it was.  By the way, that doesn't mean there aren't any problems with what she's outlined there.  There certainly are examples of discrimination.  This is, though, what she's done.  It's a symptom of a syndrome, okay?  That there is a problem that only government can fix to right the racial injustices of the past.  There's a common denominator, by the way, that I talked about.  I said I would come back to it.  That could lead to this disparity among any race.  White, black, yellow.  Let me ask this.  What could possibly be the common denominator, okay?  that could lead to a disparity in success in school.  That would also possibly lead to a disparity in incarceration rates or saving up enough money to get a home.  Let me answer that with an anecdote first followed by some data, okay?  I was at a baby shower this weekend.  My wife is out of town, so I had to attend, and I brought Betty, our puppy.  Sorry, buddy.  So it was all the parents and their kids, and Betty's a puppy, and so we're trying to socialize with as many dogs and as many kids as possible.  She's out there running around playing.  There was this boy who was screaming, by the way.  Anytime he wanted attention, just, ah!  scream, shoving other kids in the bouncy hop.  He walked up and punched Betty in the ribs as hard as he could.  Just right where the spine meets the ribs, just sounded just like that. ",

People are like, oh, a dog.  No, if you punch a dog in the ribs, you're kind of asking for it.  But the racist would look at that and say, oh, black kid.  But you know what I saw?  I saw a kid at that baby shower with the only mother without a wedding ring or a father.  He was the only kid there without a dad.  And as far as I know, he doesn't have a dad.  Now, I could give that kid free school for life.  I could give him a guaranteed job.  I could walk up and hand that mom a million dollars and it wouldn't make a shit of a difference because he doesn't have a dad.  So because he was black?  No.  All kids do poorly without dads.  They're more likely to drop out of school, to commit crimes, to be violent, to have psychological problems or behavioral disorders, to have marital problems of their own down the line, to make a lower income across the boards.  Black kids do poorly without a dad.  White kids do poorly without a dad.  But 73% of black kids don't have a dad.  But because Cortez sees blacks as a voting block, she then interprets all of these disparities as discrimination.  But there really is at least one easily explainable reason for this, or at least one correlation that makes sense across the board.  Kids who don't have dads do poorly in life.  Now, the left has been accusing the right of using this as a cop-out for all these disparities, which clearly are examples of systemic discrimination.  And only if you really looked at the systemic problems of racial injustice, only, you know what?  Here's the truth.  If you look at them, You examine them just like they don't exist.  The largest part of this solution is right in front of your faces, their faces, our faces, but the left couldn't possibly acknowledge it because that would be dabbling in the realm of moral absolutism or maybe passing judgment.  And we couldn't have the leaders of the DNC doing that.  We couldn't have them saying, you know what?  Let me use my sound judgment here.  It seems that there is a strong correlation here, and I do believe there could be some causation, that kids without dads don't do well.  If we're going to try and socially engineer people, why don't we look at something that is undeniable and encourage men to be better husbands, fathers, dads in the household?  You do that, you'd fix a lot, you certainly would fix a lot of problems.  Not all of them, but everybody would have a better head start at least.  But we're not supposed to talk about it.  The DNC could never do that.  Cortez, the intellectual heavyweight for them.  Okay, if you like this video, you know, you watch videos on YouTube.
