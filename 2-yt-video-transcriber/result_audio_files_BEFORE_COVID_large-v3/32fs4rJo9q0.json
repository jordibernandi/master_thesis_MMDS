            "text": "Hey Droogs, how you doing?  Kel here.  Well, it's kind of an overcast rainy day today in Montana and I'm at the Lynx right now.  I'm not in golf, but people I know do and they asked me if I wanted to come with them and accompany them out to the golf course and a couple golf boys with balls will be in a putter.  I might do some putting.  I like to putt.  I like to putter around.  It would be a nice opportunity to smoke a nice cigar.  This is a Romeo and Julieta 1875 and I'm smoking it.  yeah that's what it is.  and uh it's not real warm out here today but uh as you can see lots of clouds and horizons dark clouds been raining all day off and on but those crazy golfers are still out here golfing.  i thought i'd just check in with you say hello been working out still quite a bit.  i'm kind of exhausted these days.  Workouts are killing me.  Probably because I'm old and infirm.  But anyway, hello.  Thought I'd say hi.  I remember reading a forum somewhere about cigars years ago, and someone asked, are cigars allowed on the golf course?  And someone else said, allowed?  They're pretty much mandatory.  Well, I'm going to go.  Thanks for watching.  Please subscribe, hit the bell, all that kind of good stuff.  Share it with a friend.  Check out my Patreon below, all those good things.
