A person doing something in the name of God is not in any way evidence for God.  Because I could baptize Eric in the name of Lord Voldemort.  I could baptize Eric in any name.  So that's not evidence for God.  Also, speaking in tongues is not evidence for God.  It's called glossolalia.  In some cases, it is a symptom of some mental conditions, but also in many cases, it's just faked.  So, for example, I had a friend who was... best friends with a Pentecostal and Pentecostals had this requirement that at age 13, you demonstrate that you have been filled with the spirit by actually speaking in tongues.  I think it's age 13.  It's around there.  And so he's standing up in front of the church.  He's standing up in front of the church and they're expecting him to speak in tongues.  And he looks at the pastor and he says, I don't know what to do.  And the pastor says, just fake it.  We all do.  Now I'm not saying everybody fakes it.  That's not the point.  The point is it can be faked.  It has been faked.  And so there is no way for somebody like me to observe someone speaking in tongues and be able to tell at all whether they are actually speaking in a heavenly language in the case that that would be evidence for a god, or if they are just babbling incoherently.  Now, from what we know... Yeah, you know, so... What you're basically arguing is that one must experience God to have the evidence for God.  And if that's true, then it's not evidence for God because it doesn't serve as proof for anybody.  Revelation is necessarily first person.  To everybody else, it's hearsay.  That's a la David Hume.  The thing is, even for the first person, let's say you feel elated, you feel an experience, as we both have in church, and the people around you are saying, ah, that's being filled with the Holy Spirit.  I was convinced that I'd been filled with the Holy Spirit while I was in church.  I was mistaken.  There is no way for any individual human being flawed thinker to take their experience and say hmm it feels like what's been described as being filled with the whole experience.  holy spirit therefore it is and therefore i'm rationally justified in believing in a god.  that cannot happen.  that's exactly the same as someone saying i saw a ghost.  therefore this is evidence of the supernatural.  that is flawed.
