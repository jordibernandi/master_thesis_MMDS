            "text": "Hi, this is Dr.  Pechenik and today I would like to congratulate Mr.  Mueller for his brilliant report.  that cost us $25 million and on the surface seems to say simply that Trump had to pay Daniel Steele money and it seemed to be a dud.  That's not the case and let me explain why.  I think Mueller, who really regretted what he did in 9-11 before that, understood very carefully that the Republic was in serious trouble.  And what he was doing was creating a mechanism by which he entrapped the New York Times, the Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Maddow, and a whole slew of other media personnel, including Hillary Clinton and the New York Times and other major newspapers, in an attempt to take out Trump.  Now, in fancy words, we would say that was a coup.  So what he really stopped was an underlying coup that was building up for a very long time.  He did it in a very clever fashion because he entrapped them in such a way that everybody wanted to claim that Trump was either crooked and or crazy.  The one who came out the most obvious in all of this was James Clapper, DCI, John Brennan, DCI, and Mike Hayden, DCI, as well as the FBI.  And it was Mueller's way of saying the Republic will remain intact.  He understood that we in the military intelligence and in intelligence were involved in the soft coup under Nixon.  So he understood that there was a coup coming about and he did, through his report, a counter coup and exposed all of the people who had flagrantly violated their statute and their responsibilities.  The one who comes to mind is George Conway III, the husband of Kellyanne Conway.  I feel badly for her because he's such a horse's ass that he came forth and said blatantly that Trump is crazy.  He's getting crazier.  He belongs in a mental house.  Now, this is a gentleman who went to Harvard and Yale, has no experience in psychology, no experience in psychiatry.  He quotes the DSM-5 and 6.  And I'm the one, I'm a board examiner, and I'm saying to myself, how does he have the gall, the absolute gall and audacity to say anything about the president's state of mind when he himself, Mr.  Conway, was arrogant, self-aggrandizing, narcissistic, childish, infantile, self-destructive, and inappropriately paranoid.  Why?  Because he put both his wife in jeopardy and his four children in jeopardy.  This is the kind of narrative that came out in a hysterical way, but was very effective to show us what in fact was happening in the newspapers, in the media, and Mueller had allowed the system to come in to expose these types of what I would call quasi-treasonous activities.  From my point of view, having been involved in coups, this was a very subtle coup or what we would call a countercoup against those who wanted to put Trump out of the White House.  In fact, what happened as a result of the Mueller report is that I will guarantee you that Trump will come in in 2020.  He will serve a second term.  The Democratic Party will be broken apart.  And there will have to be new candidates within the Democratic Party who are not in their 70s and 80s, who are no longer the leaders of that party.  Let me quote to you something that Einstein said.  There are two things that are infinite, stupidity and the universe.  The difference is that stupidity has certain limits.  Let me quote another philosopher who said the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its own limits.  Thank you, good night, and good luck. ",
