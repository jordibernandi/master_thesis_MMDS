            "text": "Hey, what's up guys?  I'm really tired today, sorry.  So I'm like pretty low energy right now.  But I just wanted to let you know first of all I'm filming in my apartment and I never do that because it's a freaking mess.  Anyways, I made this video because I've talked to a lot of people when I travel and they all tell me These weird things that they think about China.  So many people, especially from Hong Kong or Taiwan, they say religion is illegal in China.  And I'll show you some videos in the future where I've interviewed people where they say you cannot have a religion in China.  If you pray, if you do anything, they will beat you.  That is the farthest from the truth and absolutely one of the stupidest and biggest lies from the Western media.  There's a lot of big lies out there.  This is one of them and the funny thing is they get away with it, right?  They lie straight to your face.  the Western media will just blatantly lie for their own purpose and Nothing happens.  There's no repercussions and it's just been going on for I think decades or you know centuries.  just the lies and broken treaties, dishonorable acts.  And I'm here to try to just push against it a little bit.  So I made this video just to show you guys, of course there's religion in China.  So what I did is I went to a mosque on Monday last week and just checked it out.  Alright, I hope you enjoy the vid.  Alright, so I just searched the word mosque.  And as you can see here, it says mosque is Qing Zhen Si.  I'm going to search that right now in Baidu.  There you go.  And as you can see, there's quite a few in Guangzhou.  They're not that close to where I live.  There's one 12 kilometers away right here.  So I'm going to see this one.  See, it might be open.  Let me check.  So that's there, and let's see how long it'll take.  It'll take me an hour to get there.  Right?  I'm okay.  So just so you know, if you ever come to Guangzhou railway station, there's a lot of people selling fake stuff around here, so it's a really great market if you like to get that kind of stuff.  And across the street over there, behind me, you can see the mosque.  So we're gonna go over there and see, maybe we can go in, I don't know.  Seems like the doors are open, but I got a camera, so no idea how it's gonna work.  I've been to mosques in other cities, and they've been pretty lenient.  Like, they didn't really care.  I walked around, I took pictures.  They were really cool.  They're Hui Muslims.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to get run over.  Okay, I almost got ran over there.  Yeah, I just crossed the line, so... Yeah.  All right.  Hopefully I don't get run over here.  Let's go.  Ah, red light.  Okay.  I'm making a YouTube video.  Where are you from?  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh?  Okay.  Are you Muslim?  Sorry?  Are you Muslim?  Yeah.  Are you going to go to a mosque now?  Are you going there?  I don't know.  I want to go there, but I don't know if I'm allowed.  I want to try.  It's a video.  I'm on YouTube.  Where are you guys from?  \u4f60\u597d \u4f60\u597d \u4f60\u597d \u4f60\u4eec\u4f1a\u4e2d\u6587\u5417?  Are you from?  Canada.  Canada is good, right?  I don't know, can we go?  So are you guys Muslim?  Is it okay?  I'm making a YouTube video because I just want to see is it okay to be Muslim in China?  Is it okay?  Or is it not dangerous?  I want to buy this device.  It's good.  This is good.  Okay, video of a video.  We're doing so many videos.  I don't know.  I can give you my YouTube channel.  I want to go in.  I want to try to go in if it's okay.  I don't know.  I just want to see if it's okay for Muslim people.  Because on the internet they said in China you cannot be Muslim.  I heard that.  If you go tomorrow Canton Fair, you'll get many, many people.  So many people?  Yes, many, many people.  Okay.  But I care about the Muslim people.  I want to make sure you guys are okay.  I'm not but I want to make sure you know, you're safe Because I watched the news and they just said China.  They're worried about Muslim in China.  It's very good.  Yeah, see that This is a 1080 25 frames per second.  Yeah.  All right, we're gonna go in.  So we're going to go in.  We're going into the mosque.  I'm so happy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I'm allowed to go in.  So you guys are allowed to pray?  It's okay?  Okay, good.  Wow.  Okay, I'm so happy.  Salam?  Is it salam?  Salam alaikum.  Yeah, salam alaikum.  So why do you wash the hands?  First you wash, and then you pray.  It's very nice.  Yeah, I'm so lucky I met these guys.  They are Muslims from Bangladesh, so they taught me about some things.  So do you go to mosque every day or one time a week?  or how often do you go?  Only seven days.  Every day?  Every day.  Oh, okay.  And what do you think about China?  Is it okay?  Good.  It's good?  Yeah.  It's good.  But I come to seven, eight hours.  But I don't know.  You don't know?  His maternal uncle come here around 1400 years ago.  Who died here.  He died here?  Yes.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  How do I say thank you in Bangladesh?  You said there's so many Muslims here.  Yeah, do you know why?  No, it's necessary.  Natural.  From Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia.  Wow.  It's 1,000 years ago?  1,400 years.  So this is a huge graveyard, a Muslim graveyard for, I guess, very famous Muslims that have laid to rest here.  They came from Saudi Arabia and they lived here 1,000 years.  400 years ago, there's a long history of Islam in China and it's obvious because when you go to Xi'an, the ancient capital, Xi'an, there's a huge Muslim quarter, right?  Many Muslims come here on Friday.  Friday, yeah.  Friday is our holiday.  What time do they come usually?  12 to 2 p.m How do you get it?  I'm so happy right now.  I had no idea if it'd be open.  I didn't think I would make all these friends right away.  This is just too cool.  And it's such a great opportunity to show YouTube, show you guys that everything we're hearing in the Western media is totally wrong.  Here we have, you know, Muslims completely free to worship.  I mean, it is a state-sanctioned religion.  There's, I think, five.  Catholicism, Islam, Judaism.  I don't know.  There's like five official religions that are recognized by the PRC.  Peace be upon you.  In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful Satsang with Mooji Alright, we're leaving the temple, the mosque now, and we're going to go to Canton Tower, which is the most famous, one of the most famous icons in Guangzhou, so I think they're going to like it.  And I'm definitely going to have to go to Bangladesh one day, because these guys are really nice, and it sounds like a beautiful country. ",
