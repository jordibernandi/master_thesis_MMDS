So as all of you know, I hid my channel about two weeks ago because there was a potential employment opportunity that I needed to lay low with the channel for.  It did fall through.  That's okay.  But YouTube have fucked me on my subscribers.  So I'm going to be asking all of my buddies out in the Red Pill community here to please share this video.  Subscribe, hit the bell below, like, comment.  Let's get this channel trending again.  Let's get the subscribers back up there.  I can't believe it.  I've got like 12 subscribers.  I've literally got 12.  I'm so angry I can't even talk.  I've literally got about 12 subscribers now.  of this very moment.  so guys please subscribe.  please share your favorite Sydney video with your buddies.  ask them to subscribe share it in the MGTOW groups do whatever you have to do.  but I really need to get back up there so I can start sharing the word with other people and hopefully you guys can help me out.  so Yeah, I can't do live videos until I get up to a certain number of subs.  So I'm going to let you guys go to work.  I appreciate you all in advance.  And I'm going to hit you all up with a live once I am eligible for it again.  Appreciate you all.  Peace. ",
