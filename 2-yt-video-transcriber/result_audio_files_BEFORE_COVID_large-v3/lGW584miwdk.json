As I said, he is assuming that black people will not go pursue the full two-hour clip.  And he purposefully extracted, he cut off, and you didn't hear the question that was asked of me.  He's trying to present as if I was launching a defense of Hitler in Germany, when in fact, the question that was asked of me was pertaining to whether or not I believed in nationalism.  and that nationalism was bad.  And what I responded to was that I do not believe that we should be characterizing Hitler as a nationalist.  He was a homicidal, psychopathic maniac that killed his own people.  A nationalist would not kill their own people.  That is exactly what I was referring to in the clip, and he purposely wanted to give you a cut-up similar to what they do to Donald Trump to create a different narrative.  That was unbelievably dishonest, and he did not allow me to respond to it, which is worrisome and should tell you a lot about where people are today in terms of trying to drum up narratives.  By the way, I would like to also add that I work for Prager University, which is run by an Orthodox Jew, and a single Democrat showed up to the embassy opening in Jerusalem.  I sat on a plane for 18 hours to make sure that I was there.  I'm deeply offended by the insinuation of revealing that clip without the question that was asked of me. ",

See, she's right in that same special, special, special.  You remember that special Ed bus?  They put the helmet on the person.  Well, her and David Clark, they spent a lot of time there.  They are off in their own fantasy world.  So, Candace, you are the gift to keep giving us.  And I have a great deal of patience.  And so I would strongly suggest that you don't let your man knock out your hairstyle or what little hairstyle you had that night.  You know you asked what you had to go do.  You got up late and slapped that fucked up outfit on.  Where's that outfit at?  Where's that outfit at, Candace?  Where's that outfit at?  What's that shit you put on?
