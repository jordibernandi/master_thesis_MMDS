I want your forgiveness for this, Frank said, and passed Aja a dirty napkin to sign as a kind of receipt.  Just do it and say you forgive me, and that'll be it, Frank said, and promised that a check would follow shortly.  If there was any problem, Frank told Aja to contact his son, Brian.  When no money came, Aja testified that he phoned Brian, who allegedly said, You know it's your fault.  All this happened.  You tempted my father.  A cheque arrived in AHA's mailbox soon after.  No note was attached.  End quote.  Brian later blamed homosexuality for his father's abuse.
