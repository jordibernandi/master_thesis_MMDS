            "text": "It's time to impeach the Congress.  Heck yeah.  We ain't putting up with this anymore.  Harper Valley PTA style.  I want to tell you all a story about a billionaire who ran for president.  Yeah, before he was indicted, Democrats were all screaming, Impeach him!  And that Russian collusion holds.  so Mr.  Mueller couldn't even fight.  What a loser.  So they moved right on to Ukraine.  Do they think we are all completely blind?  Well, the Dems said, Mr.  President, you're guilty of a do and quid pro quo.  It's been reported.  you've been firing ambassadors like on your TV show.  This is the worst part.  And we don't believe you ought to let the Walmart shoppers choose their president.  And it was signed by the do-nothing congressional Democrats.  Well, it happened that the Congress was going to meet that very afternoon.  And they were sure surprised when Donald J. Trump walked in and took over the room.  And as I'm sitting here, I swear I can still recall the words he had to say.  He said, I'd like to address this impeachment of the Congress USA.  Get him, Donald.  Well, there's Eric Swalwell still swearing.  it was just a coffee cup.  It was a fart, you know it.  And shit, Volatus, can you tell us what happened at the Standard Hotel?  Yeah, yeah, what's up?  And Pelosi, can you tell us exactly what your son does in Ukraine?  Cause we all wanna know.  And shouldn't Hunter Biden be here?  Seems there's a lot here to explain.  Now Schumer creeps crying at the polar execution of this Ruth.  And if we do a little digging, we will find the real reason for this coup.  Obama!  No, it's Obama.  Then I have the nerve to tell me as the president that I'm not fit.  I have the nerve to tell me as the president that I'm not fit.  No, we have to fix my nose.  This is just a little patent place and you're all democratic.  Hypocrite.  It's not time.  No, no.  No, I wouldn't put you on it.  Really didn't.  This happened just this way.  The way that Donald socked it to the dune.  Nothing Congress, nothing USA.  You ruined that line.  I ruined it.  See, I kissed my nose in there.  Nobody cares if you pinched your nose.  This is great.  Sock it to him, Donald. ",
