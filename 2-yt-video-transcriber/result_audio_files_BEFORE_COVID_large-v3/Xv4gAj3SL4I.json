            "text": "All right, here we are, question.  In John 6, 44, it says, no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him.  And I will raise him up the last day.  Also in John 6, 65, and he said, therefore I say unto you that no man can come unto me except it be given him of my Father.  We are wondering what these passages mean, Susan.  Now, Susan, that's proper to wonder that with the conflict between the heresy of Calvinism and the biblical doctrine of the free will of man, I can understand why this, you would think this might suggest what the Calvinists teach.  The Calvinists would say that what this is saying is, and I'm not exaggerating by any means.  Just go back online and read what Calvinists teach.  They would say this is saying that no man can come to God or will seek God or choose God.  And people are totally depraved in their will and their choice.  And no man in the world will ever make a choice to believe or come to God.  And so all men are damned without hope.  And that even with persuasion, men won't choose.  Even with the gospel being preached, they have no power.  That there's not any point or anything you can do externally that's going to cause a man to choose God and believe.  That's what the Calvinist teaches.  They teach that God must come down and regenerate whom he chooses to regenerate.  Others he chooses not to.  and having regenerated that individual, then they believe.  That's what a Calvinist teaches.  So a Calvinist would take this passage and say that the only people that are saved are those that God wants to be saved.  Those he doesn't want to be saved are not going to be saved.  And I'm not exaggerating.  That's exactly what they teach.  So if that's not what it's saying, what is it saying?  Context, context, always lots of context.  It's a very long context, and I'm gonna try to skip through it fast, but I want you to go back and read your own Bibles in John chapter six.  Then said, verse 28, then said they unto him, what shall we do that we might work the works of God?  Jesus answered and said unto them, this is the work of God.  They wanna do something.  That you believe on him whom he hath sent.  says you want to do something.  do this believe that's not Calvinistic.  they said therefore unto him what sign show us that we may see and believe our fathers.  ate man are you gonna give us bread from heaven?  basically he and Jesus said I'm the bread from heaven.  they said then Lord give us this bread.  Jesus said I'm the bread of life.  he that cometh to me shall never hunger.  he that believeth on me shall never thirst.  so he's offering everyone there to eat the bread.  And I said unto you that you also have seen me, and you believe not.  All the Father hath given me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me I'll in no wise cast out.  Now, Jesus is down on earth as a human being, ministering.  The Father is in heaven.  Jesus is pointing them to the Father.  He's revealing the Father to them.  And if these people believe on him, if he said, if you believe Moses and the prophets, then you'd believe me.  If you don't believe Moses and the prophets, you wouldn't believe me.  And so when these people believe God, God stirs and moves in their heart and they come to Jesus and he receives them.  Look, keep reading.  For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.  And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that at that day, that of all which he's given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.  So the Father is entrusting to Jesus the disciples those that come to god that belong to god.  he's in trusting the father trusting them to jesus.  this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which see at the sun everyone would see at the sun and believe on him has everlasting life and i'll raise him up at the last day.  now that's everyone who's there will make com.  that's not a calvinist doctrine.  that only certain ones he said.  anyone that hears anyone that leaves anyone that comes the father gives them to me.  they come to me and they believe me, and they're mine, and I'll keep them.  So we've got a working relationship here between God the Father in heaven and Jesus the man God down on earth at that time, working together.  The Jews murmured and said, he said, I'm the bread which came down from heaven.  Is not this Jesus, son of Joseph?  Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, murmur not among yourselves, No man can come to me except the Father which sent me.  draw him, and I will raise him up the last days.  You know, that's absolutely true.  Unless God moved on you, you wouldn't come to Jesus.  All people believe that.  All Christians believe that.  If you have a heathen people, they don't come to Jesus.  They have to be drawn to Jesus.  How are they drawn?  They're drawn through the words of God, through the preaching.  How should they believe except someone is sent and they gotta go?  and how should they believe unless they hear?  and what do they hear?  They hear the good news.  So we go, the Father sends us, we go, we take the good news, they hear, they're challenged to believe, and the father draws them and they come.  you see thing is it's not the will of the father that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.  so the father is actively drawing all people under himself.  he said in john he's the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.  so jesus is lighting everyone.  HE'S DRAWING EVERYONE, BUT ONLY SOME BELIEVE.  SOME COME.  WHEN THEY COME TO THE FATHER, THE FATHER GIVES THEM TO THE SON, THE SON TAKES THEM, AND HE KEEPS THEM.  HE SAID, THE WILL OF THE FATHER SENT ME, I'LL RAISE HIM UP THE LAST DAY.  HE SAID, AS IS WRITTEN IN THE PROPHETS, THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD.  EVERY MAN, THEREFORE, THAT HATH HEARD, and have learned in the. ",
