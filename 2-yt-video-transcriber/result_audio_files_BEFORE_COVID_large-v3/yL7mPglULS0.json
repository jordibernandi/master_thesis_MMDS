The quicker we resolve this, the quicker it will be over.  What's your name, ma'am?  What's your name?  What you need my name for?  Because you're a public servant and you need to identify yourself.  I need to know who I'm talking to at this office.  It's the law.  I'm not a public servant, therefore I'm not required to do so.  And I'm allowed by law to make my public records request anonymously.  Okay, someone will be right with you, okay?  So you don't want to give me your name?  No, sir.  Okay, we'll do it the hard way because that's going to be added... It should be no problem.  I'll get your name on the public records request.  You and Swole.  You see?  Hey.  I need your name.  And I need another public record.  I need, yeah, we did.  And I just came from the police station and he told me I could come back.  So you need to comply.  You call him again.  Go ahead.  Swole.  Get somebody to take my public records request.  Do you think if I was not allowed to do this, I would be back here?  I got kids.  I don't want to be in jail.  These people get a kick out of violating my civil rights.  This is the day you got some drama in their life cooking today.  This is ridiculous.  Hi.  And I went to the police department.  I filed a complaint, and the sergeant, you can call him and ask him, you need to comply with my records request.  It's a legal records request.  That was an illegal trespass.  That officer is going to face a lot of money out of his own pocket.  The city isn't going to pay for it.  But that aside, I have other records that I need.  Can you please take them down?  Just comply.  Thank you.  Yeah, I don't need to hang out here, even though I'm legally allowed to.  I would like to know how many cases were changed.  Oh, don't write in red.  That's bad luck.  You lose money if you write in red ink.  Changed mid-case.  How many cases were changed?  The public defender was changed mid-case.  How many public defenders were fired mid-case?  Changed, basically fired or whatever by their clients.  Those are two very different things.  Okay, how many were changed mid-case?  And I'd like the names of all these employees, especially this guy right here.  And Hope's last name? ",
