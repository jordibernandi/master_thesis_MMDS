He says it would not be appropriate for her to comment for this story because she has not yet been sentenced.  Evans is scheduled to be sentenced for the felony conviction on March 22nd.  Brian, let's go back for a second.  So both former sheriffs, Clark and Schmitz, are pointing the fingers at one another for not firing her sooner.  Did either of them say why she was promoted to run the jail in the first place after all of this?  I was able to actually reach former Sheriff Richard Schmitz by phone.  He talked to me briefly.  He said he felt Evans was well-trained and qualified when he first recommended her in 2011, but he declined to comment on what has happened since then, saying the voters had their say when they elected Sheriff Lucas last fall and they probably don't want to hear from him anymore.  so that was all we heard from him on.

I don't care what they say, because I read, I do a lot of reading and a lot of deep researching.  Still, at the end of the day, the sheriff was still in charge and stuff.  And he's one of those type that like to pass the buck because I was wondering, it was boggling my mind.  Why would he abruptly resign?  He knew this shit was going to hit him because now you're dealing with death.  So, basically, what this state is dealing with is they are cleaning up the sheriff's shit.  And the only thing that I feel bad about is the death of the inmates and the infant child.  But the rest of it, I don't care.  They have had to do audits.  They didn't have to check all kind of stuff because... He wasn't really there.  So he would just shift it on to someone else because, you know, he was trying to make America great again.  And he don't give a damn about those people's deaths.  But I tell you this, his hands are not clean.  He took no responsibility.  And even though these staffers will pay the penalty for not properly doing their job, ultimately in the end you know he was the boss.  he was the head nigga in charge.  so if he won't if they won't if they won't get his ass then he has to deal with the law of nature and nobody can't get around that.  So, I just wanted to present this video.  Because, you know, y'all know how I feel about the sheriff.  Anytime his crazy ass pop up, oh, I'm going to do my thug thistle.  So, anyway, my royal family, render your voice with your beautiful divine words.  And as always, my royal family, I thank you for your love.  I thank you for your support.  And with that said, I shake. ",
