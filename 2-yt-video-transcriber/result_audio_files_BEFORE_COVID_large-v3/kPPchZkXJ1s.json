            "text": "Well, I don't know if the Holy Bible was put together by the white supremacists or not.  That's controversial.  Some people say yes, some people say no.  I say I don't know.  But I do know this.  Whatever the white supremacists touch, they are not going to fool with it for five minutes unless they figure out a way in five minutes to put it to work.  For the system of white supremacists, they'll find something else to touch.  So if a white supremacist puts his hand on a Bible, or her hand on a Bible, they are going to say, now, this Bible is already here.  But I am going to use it to do the things that I want to do.  And I'm going to make everybody else of color fall in line so that this Bible will support whatever it is that I want done.  And I will even change the meaning of every passage of it without changing a word.  I'll just say, that's not what that means.  And the black preacher will say, that is what that means.  It's right here in the Bible.  But the white supremacists say, boy, what did I say it meant?  It meant that yesterday.  Why?  Because I said that it meant that yesterday.  But that's not what it means today, boy.  Hey, who's your master here on earth?  Your master in your heart and in your head and in your church.  that I allow you to have is somebody else.  But you call your God, and that's okay.  I'll let you do that.  But, boy, when I walk in your church, with or without a gun, you will, and you and your congregation, your choir, and everybody you got here, young and old, will and have obeyed me from day one.  So don't get in my face waving a Bible, boy. ",
