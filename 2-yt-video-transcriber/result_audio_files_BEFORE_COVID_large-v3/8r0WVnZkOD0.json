            "text": "The S&P hit a record high on Tuesday, extending Monday's rally as investors looked ahead to a potential rate cut from the Fed.  Expectations of easier monetary policy help to lift the market even as phase one of the U.S.-China trade deal may not be finalized in Chile, sinking the market into close.  Facts and data show that 78% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beat analysts' expectations.  But could it be that the expectations were just set too low?  Are current valuations justified for businesses just being less bad?  Investors are now struggling to find new reasons to buy and extend the new record rally in equities, and analysts point out that the big risk is that we're seeing a boost to asset prices, but no real uptick in the real economy.  So for more on this, we're now joined by Peter Schiff, CEO of the Euro Pacific Capital.  So Peter, phase one deal just hyped up this entire bull rally.  And this is just an interim deal that basically just kicks the trade can worries down the road and delays action.  The US is actually hedging themselves right now as Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is still not giving a definitive answer on whether or not the December 15th tariff will be taken off the table.  So if phase one is this hard to nail down, how bad will phase two be? ",

We saw this record close yesterday on the S&P 500.  But this is the third rate cut here we're talking about.  We have been over this before, and you pretty thoroughly demolished their arguments for it.  But what are they saying now to justify this third cut when stocks are hovering near a 15-month high? ",

            "text": "Well, we'll see how they walk that tightrope.  They're trying to pretend that these rate cuts are just some kind of mid-course correction, some kind of insurance policy.  But if you remember, a year ago at this time, not only was the Fed raising rates, but they had forecast that they would continue to raise rates throughout 2019.  I was the only one out there saying that they weren't gonna do that, that they were gonna be cutting rates, not raising them.  But more than that, it's not just that they're cutting rates, they're back to quantitative easing.  They have called off quantitative tightening, reversed course, they're doing quantitative easing, except they're not admitting that that's what they're doing because they're embarrassed.  I have to acknowledge this.  But if you actually look at how rapidly the Fed's balance sheet is growing now, it's actually growing faster when they're not doing QE than when they were. ",

They're injecting $130 daily every single night on daily repos.  Why is the Fed injecting so much liquidity into the system when they still claim that nothing is wrong?  And right now we're expecting a very hawkish rate cut tomorrow. ",

            "text": "Look, all of these stocks, Google included, are dramatically overvalued because of the Fed, because of the monetary policy that we've pursued.  We have inflated asset prices like stocks and like real estate.  Now, there are a lot of companies that aren't worth anything.  There are a lot of these companies that are losing money that have high market values because of the Fed.  Now, Google at least makes a profit, but in today's interest rate environment, the present value of those profits has been inflated by the Fed.  What the Fed is trying to do is prevent those asset prices from coming back down to earth.  But for a healthy economic recovery, that's what we need.  We can't continue to have overpriced assets.  You know, Donald Trump put out a tweet today in which he's envious of the Europeans and the Japanese because they have negative rates.  And he says, this is great.  You know, they get to borrow.  They get to be paid to borrow.  Why can't Americans get paid to borrow?  What Trump is overlooking is who is paying the bill?  Who is stuck with the cost?  It's the savers that should be getting paid by the borrowers who are borrowing money.  It's the citizens who are going to end up losing because they're financing these loans.  But all of this is producing malinvestment.  It's helping to expand government at the expense of the real economy. ",
