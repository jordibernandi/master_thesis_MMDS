            "text": "what's happening.  fam lar movement still moving book is entitled lessons from a non-custodial father at amazon.  kindle and create space link will be in the description box below as usual.  go get it.  paypal link there also.  they asked me to put it up so i'll put it up.  thanks everybody for supporting.  but this video.  this video is entitled a mother's fear of her son's red pill awareness.  see You know, mom is supposed to be innocent.  And I was having this issue in my own life where there are times where I can't communicate with my son because some of the things I tell my son makes him aware of shenanigans faster than his mother would like to know.  Prime example.  And I talk like this in theory.  So, there was a time my son was lying.  Trying to use people and manipulate people.  And I get on the phone.  And I say, okay, you know those hero movies and cartoons you like?  He's like, yeah.  Like, who lies?  The hero or the villain?  He's like, the villain?  I said, who uses people?  The hero or the villain?  He's like, okay, the villain?  I said, who manipulates the hero or the villain?  He's like, manipulate.  So we had to run down what manipulate was.  He's like, okay, yeah, yeah, the villain does that.  So I said, so right now, what are you acting like?  And he's like, The hero.  And I'm like, really?  And then he's like, I said, okay, so in your mind you want to be the hero.  What would the rest of the people see you as if you was doing these things?  He's like, yeah, they're going to see me as the villain.  The need to be right, right?  But when I have these type of conversations, his mother gets like, Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  No.  And I use that as an example because the people in my family, the women I've dated and come across, who are mothers, especially the boys, they don't want that light bulb to go off.  A lot of them don't want that light bulb to go off in their son's head like, wait.  That's you, that's you.  And because it takes the veil off, you know, what happens when, you know, your mom teaches you to look at girls and young women and women in a certain way, and you're looking at your mom like, but you don't exhibit any of these qualities, these angelic qualities that you're saying presides in these young ladies and these females.  And then, and also, you start seeing they playing the same games.  And then it's like, wait, if she's like this and you do the same things, that means the veil comes off.  Like, wait, she's lying just like you're lying.  I'm supposed to ride with you because you're my mom, but she's supposed to be a liar.  And most kids know right and wrong for the most part.  But, you know, when a son hits that awareness, he might just completely dismiss his mother.  And some people think about the times where, you know, they say, oh, he's acting out of pocket.  I'm going to send you to your dad or you need to be with your father now because it's too much.  It's not just a testosterone thing as a teenager.  It's also... The logic of the two genders don't mix.  So he tunes you out.  Because you're not making sense.  And what I mean by that is, I remember there was a time when, you know, we was broke.  And it was because your father ain't sending no money.  And I'm like, you're a bad spender.  It has nothing to do with money.  It's your bad spender.  You've been a bad spender.  You will continue to be a bad spender.  You are a bad spender.  And it's like, nah, nah.  I'm like, oh yeah, oh yeah.  So, and I've seen kids, teenagers and grown men, and their kids grow to be grown men, and that awareness kicks in like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everything you taught me mom is BS.  Because I was watching you run these same games on Harold when I was a kid.  Telling me the opposite.  Saying that he was the bad guy.  But the problem is.  I'm getting the same games you gave Harold.  And I ain't do nothing to these people.  So.  You know.  Sometimes.  I've seen people.  Try to effeminize their sons.  And how can I say this?  And effeminate them to the point that they hope they feel, act, and go through the same emotions as a woman.  so they'll never actually get masculine enough to question the logic.  Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.  You know, because at a certain point, guys want to just be natural.  You start realizing you're imitating a girl.  I know a few guys who are effeminate.  and you know one of them felt some type of way that he realized that you know people didn't walk like he did.  people didn't.  well the guys didn't walk like he did.  the guys didn't talk like he did.  the guys weren't into the things that he was and he started to be like wait a minute okay well But realizing the girls are into those things.  It's cool because he played it because he was effeminate, but he'd be like, hey, I could chill with the girls, y'all can't.  Because he would be bagging some of them, but the fact that he was effeminate only went so far also.  But coming to that realization that in the unknown other side of the fence was, you know, We were going to act a certain way.  And he knew it wasn't us.  It was him.  That's the part I forgot.  The second part.  Because when you're hanging around the fellas.  And you realize.  You know.  You're not some special kind of man.  But when you're hanging around the women.  You fit in just right.  You realize as a person.  Like wait.  I act more like them than I do like them.  Okay.  So.  It is what it is.  But.  The mindset normally doesn't connect because, you know, mom doesn't tell you the whole story.  Mom tells you dad was in the streets.  Mom don't tell you mom was in the streets.  So, guess what happens?  You know, she did no wrong.  You know, all of these old school stories of your mama was in the church, but your daddy was in them streets.  Well, your daddy didn't meet your mama in the church.  He met her in the streets, okay?  So... You're going to have to get that granddad.  Grandma was a nice churchgoer.  She'd take me to church every Sunday.  That's not where granddad was going with on Sunday.  He was having hot, steamy relations.  And see, the red pill of weariness in the logic kicks in.  They're like, you know what?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You own one too.  And, you know, sometimes, you know, when I was younger, girls would pull stunts and they'd think I didn't see them coming.  And I'm like, in my mind I'm thinking to myself, You know what?  My mom been doing that.  My cousins do that.  My aunts do that.  You know, I've seen it a million times.  You're going to tell me it's something new.  And in the beginning, I was fooled because I was in that young phase where, you know, the girls, when I was a teenager, the girls my age got to be as innocent as me.  And they don't think like the adult women.  It takes time.  But I didn't realize, you know, that's what they've been teaching these little girls.  So, but as I grew old, I'm like, I don't know, this is the culture.  And as I realized more and more that it was the culture, I was aware to not believe everything I heard from the opposite sex or to question what I heard from the opposite sex or to just keep it in my mental bank, like, okay.  And the more I did that, the more me and my mom actually would bump heads because it was like... She was losing more and more control.  Every time she did something to kill the innocence of thinking women were angelic, the girls did it too.  And you put two and two together and you're like, I can't respect it.  I don't respect them.  I can't respect you because you doing the same thing that they doing.  Y'all two different ages, but y'all doing the exact same thing.  And the ethics of it is completely horrible.  So now, you know, I lose more respect for them because I'm not related to them.  But it was it a chip away at the the awareness of.  For me as a son, but I've seen a lot of guys go through the same thing because mom fears that awareness won't see me in a positive light anymore because a lot of this stuff that red pill awareness brings is red pill rage right after.  So you start getting mad because you question everything that happened prior and you're like, you've always been foul.  So, you know, it is what it is, but we out.  Peace. ",
