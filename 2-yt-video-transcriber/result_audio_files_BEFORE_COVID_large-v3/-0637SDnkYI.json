This is clip number three, where we had mentioned earlier that Bret Baier had to sort of maintain some semblance of being the straight news guy.  And so I am not going to feel quite as humiliated when I take a survey of the audience and find that everything I've been promoting on Fox News for over a decade is not popular with the people who are here for some reason.  Now, this was done.  This town hall was in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  I don't I mean.  If you had told me that this was done at the auditorium at the University of Vermont and that I would have been like, oh, that makes sense.  But this audience.  I don't know if Fox News doesn't have a lot of attention, but this audience seemed to be incredibly amenable to Bernie Sanders and his policies, which theoretically have been maligned on Fox News for ages.  And here, Martha McCallum, and I think this is getting towards the end of the of the thing where.  There's I think these two hosts are got to feel like we have in some way failed because we're not getting that moment or the series of moments where we have exposed Bernie Sanders or.  For either having policies that don't make sense or having policies that are not popular with this broad section of people.  And and so I think there's a lot of frustration involved in this.  And you can see Martha McCallum and just play this exchange. ",

But I think if you look at polling, especially among Democrats, as I'm sure you have, you tell me, strong majority of Democrats and more than a few Republicans want to see a Medicare for all program.  What the opponents, let's be clear about this, Martha.  When you are dealing with health care, which is, what's it, 18 percent of our GDP?  I mean, we're talking about three and a half trillion dollars a year.  and you have insurance companies that make billions and billions of dollars in profit.  Let me give you an example, if I might, of the dysfunctionality of the current healthcare system.  Recently, Aetna merged with CVS, you may recall that, big merger, which in my view will drive healthcare costs up.  The gentleman who was head of Aetna, a name Mr.  Bertolini, you know what he got from putting together that merger?  He got a $500 million bonus.

And the thing is, is that there is no.  there has been no one who has been able to produce a report.  There's been no research.  There's been no estimates.  Even the Mercatus study from the right wing think tank.  There has been nothing released by anyone who can who can.  refute that central dynamic and the thing that bernie is doing.  that is different from when they talked about where in vermont it failed was a governor showman.  i think it was his name.  the.  the thing that bernie is doing and and we used to get calls from john from san antonio will call in all the time about this very point is that you must lead with the idea that taxes are going to be raised because taxes are going to be raised.  And Bernie makes the point it is free at the point of service and it is free when you pay for it.  But you're but it's not free.  You're going to have to pay for it.  It's going to be in taxes.  And middle class people, as well as wealthy people, are going to pay more in taxes.  But the net expenditures are going to be less because you're not going to be paying for premiums and for basically the profits.  and the inefficiencies in the private insurance market.  and then the you know it is even bring up the fact that like.  and then the other good thing is is you have to deal the tremendous hassle like a like.  i have like spreadsheets.  i have uh... google drives.  with that i take pictures of like.  you know souls i therapy and i take the pictures and i upload them and i see if they you know my insurance gonna pay form and i got decent insurance.
