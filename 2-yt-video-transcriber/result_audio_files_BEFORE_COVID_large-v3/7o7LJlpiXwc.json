You know, I think too often veterans as a whole are kind of demonized and civilian culture looks at us in a very negative light.  So having the opportunity to tell stories of like legendary men and women that I served with and putting it in a book, that's going to live forever.  And those stories from the GWAT have to be told because there's lessons learned from the military and service that I think will be applicable for future generations that are serving and post-service as well.

These are experiences that I had and they molded me into the man that I am.  saying what my history is and my time in service, I think that's a great thing.  And then it can show people that are serving that are 18, 19 that there's a road forward post service that they can go out and do what they want.  So they're just stupid. ",

And that's what I think.  that when you talk about that veteran subculture and why your videos have been so popular, why your company has been so popular, because veterans have a different type of humor.  People in the military have a different type of humor and that's okay.  But it's almost like the outside wants to say, well, you can't say that you can't do that, but you guys just don't care. ",

And there's a piece of irreverence that is associated with war.  I mean, it's so romanticized in Hollywood, but body parts and all that stuff, it can weigh on you.  So a lot of EMS and law enforcement deal with that through humor.  And so that's been our outlet, showing that we can come together, we can joke like we did back in the team rooms, just like sports teams do in the locker rooms.  And we could put it out there and make people not feel alone for having that kind of macabre sense of humor.  And I take massive pride in that.  And then the naysayers to that, I don't care, because you can live in your fake bubble of PC culture and walk around with your microaggressions and live a miserable life, because I'm not going to live a miserable life.  I'm going to live the American dream. ",
