You probably don't think of the city of Fresno as being particularly revolutionary, but you might be surprised to learn that just a little over 60 years ago, this California city changed the face of how the entire world does business.

            "text": "So I'm exploring California's Central Valley today.  The tourism industry in California is booming right now.  In fact, 2018 marked its eighth consecutive year of growth.  According to the US Department of Commerce, over $140 billion was spent on tourism in California in 2018 alone.  We had over 7.5 million overseas arrivals at a California port of entry, with 66% going through LAX, 33% going through San Francisco International.  And then 1% must have gotten lost and ended up at San Diego.  Anyway, in spite of those staggering statistics, I'm currently exploring Fresno.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  Fresno, California isn't one of those places that's on the forefront of thought when you think of the traditional California experience.  Places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Napa Valley, or Yosemite.  Fresno is located at the geographical center of California, and I think because of that, there's some confusion on whether or not it belongs to Northern California or Southern California.  So if you have a thought on that, let me know in the comments down below.  In 1958, the city of Fresno, California played a critical role, actually a central role, in reshaping the face of global commerce.  And if you use one of these, a credit card, then you can thank the city of Fresno, California.  You see, up until the late 1950s, there hadn't existed yet a universal system of revolving credit, like a credit card we use today.  Instead, consumers had to open multiple credit accounts with several merchants, like department stores, and those balances had to be paid in full each month.  It was a little inconvenient, to say the least, to get multiple bills from multiple merchants every month and then having to pay them in full.  And there was kind of a catch-22 reason why there wasn't a universal credit card back then.  You see, consumers didn't want to use a card that not enough merchants accepted, and merchants didn't want to accept a card that too few consumers used.  So in 1958, Bank of America set out to solve this problem when it introduced the BankAmericard, the world's first credit card.  But it needed a test market that was large enough to make a credit card work, small enough to curb startup costs, and remote enough to control a potential PR disaster if the project didn't go to plan.  The answer was Fresno, California.  In the late 1950s, the population of Fresno, California was approximately 130,000, and 45% were customers of Bank of America.  So in September of 1958, over 60,000 Bank of America credit cards were mailed to unsuspecting Fresno residents, and the result was absolute chaos.  First, the bank kind of panicked when they got wind that a competitor bank was about to release a similar credit card in Los Angeles.  So Bank of America expanded its test market to Los Angeles and San Francisco.  So by 1959, over 2 million Bank of America cards saturated the entire state of California.  Secondly, Bank of America put a little too much trust in its customers' ability to pay their bills on time.  In its first year, the Bank of America card had a 22% delinquency rate.  And then there was an issue at the bank's Los Angeles branches where a bunch of managers got together and rightly so said, you know, we should probably make a list of people that shouldn't receive this credit card.  People like drug dealers and chronic debtors.  Well, some poor schlub in the paperwork department messed up the paperwork, and every one of those deadbeats received a Bank AmeriCard.  Now, this is just absolute madness.  I mean, borderline negligence.  It's almost like going to a recovering alcoholic and saying, you're a complete failure at life.  Here, hold my whiskey.  I'll be right back.  And then at one point, thieves broke into a warehouse owned by Bank of America, stole a bunch of unembossed credit cards, and then blackmailed the bank into buying them back.  So the program was a complete failure.  It lost $20 million in its first year alone, and that's about $150 million in today's dollars.  The program manager was forced to resign from the bank, and it was back to the drawing board with the credit card.  Well, after a couple of years, Bank of America ironed out the kinks, and the Bank AmeriCard morphed into what we know today as Visa, a name that was chosen for its wide name recognition across multiple languages.  I was real curious to check out the city of Fresno for myself, so I drove up here this weekend And let me tell you, I think I picked the worst possible time to go to Fresno.  There is a massive heat wave going across California right now, and yep, it's 105 degrees outside.  So I'm going to push through it and explore as much of the city as I can before I get a heat stroke. ",

            "text": "Fresno is actually the sixth largest city in California by land area and is Spanish for ash tree.  In fact, it received this name due to the abundance of California ash trees located along the San Joaquin River.  The Central Pacific Railroad put the city on the map as a train station in 1872 before it was officially incorporated in 1885.  In the 1960s, Fulton Street in downtown Fresno was transformed into one of the first pedestrian malls in the United States.  Unfortunately, the Fulton Mall declined during the 1980s, and in 2016, after receiving a $15.9 million grant from the U.S.  Department of Transportation, Fulton Street was converted back to a city street and vehicle traffic was reintroduced.  The Fresno Zoo can trace its roots all the way back to 1908 when it housed just two bears and 50 birds.  Today, the 13-acre property is home to 190 species, 94 of which are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan.  Located west of downtown inside the 225-acre Kearney Park sits a French Renaissance-style mansion built in 1903.  Kearney Mansion was built for owner M. Theo Kearney, a major player in the agricultural development of both Fresno County and the state of California.  He introduced the colony farm system to Fresno County, which allowed middle-class land purchasers to begin farming right away without the traditional hefty startup costs involved.  kearney willed his entire estate to the regents of the university of california in hopes that they would turn it into a college of agriculture but the university ended up selling all of kearney's land in nineteen forty nine except for kearney park which was leased to fresno county.  there's much more to fresno california than meets the eye and in light of the one hundred five degree heat i'm glad i was able to check out even just a fraction of the city.  If you've ever been to Fresno or the surrounding area, let me know some of your favorite spots in the comments down below.  Thanks for watching, and as always, remember to never stop exploring! ",
