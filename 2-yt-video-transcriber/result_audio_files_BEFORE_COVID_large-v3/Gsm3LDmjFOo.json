            "text": "My video for February the 13th, 2019 is video number 2,995.  And the title is a question.  Are reports about high-profile arrests true?  I continue to get reports sent to me about the arrest of high-profile people and trials at Gitmo and other places.  David Zublick's channel has this blurb.  on a one hour and 10 minute video called Breaking News.  Quote, billionaire financier George Soros has been arrested and is being detained in Switzerland for interrogation before being extradited to the United States where he will face a military tribunal as an enemy combatant.  George W. Bush pleads guilty to high crimes and misdemeanors, including 9-11.  Barack Obama, being detained at Gitmo, charged with high treason, begs for his life.  David Zublick unseals the truth in this special report, end quote.  While I'd like this and more revelations to be true, there is no way to confirm any of it.  If it's being kept under wraps as reported, how does Zublick or anyone get to report it?  Ah, the impasse.  Can we ever know the truth in a world of deception?  Another report by Area 17 Ground Zero says, quote, the deep state rabbit hole is deeper than any of us could have imagined.  I'm sure that is true.  And I really hope it all comes out ASAP as soon as possible.  Can we fix the illusion of this reality?  I added that last sentence or that last question about fixing the illusion because so many of my friends in the spiritual community continue to say, it's all an illusion, Ron.  It's all an illusion.  Yes.  It's just an illusion.  Experience doesn't mean a damn thing, does it?  Well, I don't buy that.  Experience is what is real to me and to most people.  We get sick.  We experience the symptoms of the sickness.  You know, I just finished another report on the alternative medicine and it says that we're undernourished and that's the reason we get sick.  if we were properly nourished we wouldn't get sick.  what I'm driving at is that we have been told lies all of our lives nothing Virtually nothing of value.  that we've been told is true, with the exception that all religions do teach that we're supposed to love one another.  But none of them, virtually none of them, practice it.  Now there are individuals in all of them that probably do practice it.  And some people say the problem is the Jews, the problem is the Jews.  No, most Jews are innocent.  Most Christians are innocent.  Most Muslims and Hindus and Buddhists and people of no religion at all are innocent.  Even many atheists are innocent of all the problems that we face as human beings.  But we do live on a planet of lies, a planet of deception.  And the deception is everywhere, in everything.  We have been formed and shaped by things that just simply aren't true.  When I say I'm not talking about our physical creation now, I'm talking about our mental perception of what we call reality.  Is it real?  It's certainly experientially real.  But what's behind it all?  I hope that David Zublick is right.  I hope what he's reporting as breaking news about George Soros, George Bush, Barack Obama, and others, Hillary and others, I didn't name that in the blurb, but I watched half of his one hour and ten minute video.  I don't know, you know, if all of these revelations that are coming out have a basis in reality.  because he admits that it's not going to be reported on the mainstream news, and I understand that.  The mainstream news is bought and paid for by the same people that have been running the scam.  That's just simply the way it is.  But how do we know what to believe?  How do we know what we can trust as being factual?  Can anything that we've been told Be dependent on?  Yes, as I keep saying.  We're supposed to love one another.  We're supposed to transcend our religion and get to our spirituality.  But people use spirituality as a religion too.  As I've talked about in recent videos and previous videos.  Everything is distorted.  Everything has been manipulated for... what seems like nefarious purposes now is the ultimate purpose to liberate us?  is the ultimate purpose to teach us how deep we can sink if we don't believe the truth that sets us free.  But how can we believe the truth when everything in this, everything in the system, has been doctored.  And I don't mean doctored in a positive way, I mean manipulated in a very negative fashion.  This is the reality that I see in the world around me.  And I'd like David Zublik and Area 17 Ground Zero, I'd like these reports to be true.  I'd like to see that high profile individuals around the world that have committed crimes against humanity.  I'd like to see that justice can prevail, that the truth can come out and the truth, even though it will piss us off, will set us free.  I don't blame it on any one group of people.  I do blame it on fallen angels, I do blame, in a sense, the Creator for allowing such a travesty to have ever even existed.  That dark forces, lying forces, could take over a planet anywhere at any time.  That doesn't make sense to me.  Now maybe I'm not seeing enough of the picture yet.  And I'll grant that because I'm still hoping and praying.  I mean, I just, my prayers this morning before I even got out of bed and last night before I went to sleep, my prayers continued day in and day out to go up to heaven and say, God, please take responsibility for creation.  If it's up to us, then empower us to make the changes that need to be made so that the truth can come out, so that humanity can be freed from the bondage of... I don't even like... I mean, people say it's the bondage of sin.  No, it's the bondage of deception.  That's the sin.  We've been deceived.  And how do we get out of the morass of all of the lies that we've been told?  Many of which we've believed at least to some point are true at various stages of our lives.  We believe them, folks.  And yet we didn't have all of the information.  We didn't have enough to be able to connect the dots.  and to see the bigger picture.  And that's what I'd like to see.  I'd like to see the bigger picture and I'd like to be able to experience truth and justice.  I'd like to be able to experience loving one another and helping each other, lifting each other up instead of suppressing and keeping down people and keeping down ideas that challenge the status quo.  I'd like that very much.  How about you?  Whose side are you on?  I'm on the side of humanity.  I'm on the side of love.  I'm on the side of truth.  Thank you for listening and namaste. ",
