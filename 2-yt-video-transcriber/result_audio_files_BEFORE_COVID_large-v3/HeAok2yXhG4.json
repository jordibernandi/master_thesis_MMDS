He knew how to walk on the inside.  It's a straight right hand right down the middle.  And that's the way to fight a southpaw.  So Rodriguez knows that he's going in there too.  He's planting.  Not a good idea to stay there.  He feels the rope slide down.  Now he looks for it.  Bangs the belly of Big Rick Dyer.  That'll get your attention in a hurry.

Now Cook catches him.  Rocks Dyer.  Now he flashes to the middle.  Back up.  Stands with the left hand.  Crashing right hand.  And that toppled him a little bit, didn't it?  Yes.  Did that block the knees?  Dyer got in some trouble there, and he has to tie up, and he's breathing a little bit heavy.  He was nailed by Rodriguez with some good counter shots.  Little man, so to speak, almost knocked over the big giant.  Remember, we're at Alcatraz here in Chicago.  He's rocked on his feet.  Big left hook catches him.  Is the big guy going to topple?  He has to hang on.  Look at his legs.  He's real loose with the knees.  His heels are heavy.  And Rodriguez is the real... The big guy crumples down like a big redwood tree.  He hits the canvas.  It's up to five and six for the first time.  Diatase scammers.  Seven and he's up at eight.  He barely made it up.  He barely made it up.  You're right, David.  So much for Rick Dyer in his 13 and 0 as the bell ends and I don't know if he can survive.  Look at him.  He's still out on his feet.  He got cracked.  David Rodriguez is the real deal, my friend.

And we'll leave out the reigning champions, Shagaev, Muskaev, Peters, Klitschko, and Saltanyi Brogomov.  You get to think that this guy could maybe fall in there around fifth to sixth if he fought either... Briggs, Valuev, Lakovic, Brewster, Tony or Ruiz.  Of course, he's not going to be fighting Brewster because Brewster has a world title shot coming up in a couple of weeks in Cologne, Germany against Vladimir Klitschko.  So that's out.  But I think, you know, Ruiz would be a nice step up because a guy hasn't fought in a while.  Ruiz is tough as nails.  He's a former champion.  This would be a good opponent to test this guy and find out how good David Rodriguez is.  Well, coming up in our main event of the evening, it's going to be Evander Holyfield and Lou Savarese.  as you watch David Rodriguez play to his crowd here at the Don Haskins Center.  And there's Lou Savarese getting taped up.  Lou Savarese is a wonderful guy, a terrific human being.  In fact, the heavyweights, they don't come any nicer than Evander Holyfield and Lou Savarese.  Lou Savarese is an actor.  And he's also a terrific fighter.  Evander crossed the way.  Look at the body on this guy.  Who says this guy shouldn't be fighting?  A lot of people have said he shouldn't be fighting.  But when you look again at Tony Ruiz, Bruce Delikovic, of course he had his problems with Tony.  But this is a different Evander Holyfield today, Dave, on Dempo. ",
