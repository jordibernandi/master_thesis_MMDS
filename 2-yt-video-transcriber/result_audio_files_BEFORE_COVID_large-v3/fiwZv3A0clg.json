Artists is not who they say they are.  I know it wasn't an accidental thing.  They were chosen and they sold themselves out, which means their producer, who's satanic too.  and even worse, whatever he says, they have to do and they have to follow it.  And God forbid if they ever mention Flat Earth or anything like that, they'll probably be killed.  what and that's we're talking.  millions and millions of people.  when you've got to that point you're believing all right.  trust me on this it's true.

Yeah, seems perfectly logical to me. ",

So well done, Bob.  Well, well, well, wasn't that fun?  Such an angry guy.  If you don't want to get yourself worked up like that, don't believe in something so ridiculous and expect people to buy into it.  Getting angry isn't helping, it's just pointing out how triggered you are.

Well, no, that's not entirely true.  I think I know what the problem is, and hopefully, while I'm saying this, they will be correctly scrolling across the bottom of the screen.
