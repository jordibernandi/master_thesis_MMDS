And Bill, what started as kind of a joke on Facebook, a young guy about 20 years old started a Facebook event saying Storm Area 51 and so we can see them aliens.  has turned into something that at last count, almost two million people have confirmed that they plan to attend the event.  Another one and a half million people said they were interested in it.  And some hotels in the area are reporting that they are getting booked up.  And not only hotels, but campground areas.  that people, not necessarily two million people, but people are planning to come to this effort where we're just going to run into Area 51, which is, of course, a U.S.  government facility, I think, managed by the Air Force.  Bill, first of all, is there something more than a joke here?  I mean, is it just that two million people or three and a half million people think this is funny?  Or do you think that there's some serious commitment here? ",

If people can just simply walk into Area 51 and have everybody just simply do what we've done for their entire lives, which is just give them their way, if we back down, if the government backs down over this, then there will be no reason why they should respect any kind of authority at all.

            "text": "but um When we think about Y2K, we think of the ozone hole.  We think of global warming.  We think of all of these things that are going to happen.  They're going to be catastrophes.  I remember this last hurricane season a couple of years ago.  There was this one hurricane.  I don't remember what it was.  It was in Florida.  It was going to go right up I-95 and destroy the entire state.  This is what we expect will happen.  We are wired for drama.  We're wired for reversals and so on after the way movies have programmed us.  But let's just think about this.  Again, logic is our friend here.  People will show up, I have no doubt, that they just consider it another Burning Man.  So people are going to show up.  When they actually see the desert and when they see how much running forward with their chest forward and their arms behind them, how many miles they're going to have to cover, that's going to take care of most of them.  But let's just say for the sake of the argument that a significant number of people, hundreds, maybe thousands, let's say, decide that they're going to go over this perimeter where it says, caution, lethal force will be employed beyond this point.  What would happen then?  What would happen then, I think, is that I don't think that this is going to catch people by surprise on the inside of Area 51.  I suspect that large amounts of non-lethal weapons will be brought to bear.  And I suspect that as people keep going deeper into the complex, these warnings will continue.  And I suspect if I had to guess, the warnings will sound like this.  Warning, you will get an audio warning.  Then they would probably go to tear gas.  I would guess if the tear gas didn't do it, I have seen footage of something that sounds like science fiction, but it's not.  It is a device that broadcasts microwaves.  It's non-lethal and it's non-permanent.  But when that thing is turned on you, you feel like your skin is on fire.  I've seen a group of people from the Air Force in uniform, including Air Force generals, willingly going out there to undergo this test, see what it's like, and they just say, whoa, turn that thing off.  And so I suspect we have enough non-lethal means to basically turn these people around.  I think The majority of people are just kind of innocent and kind of stupid young people who think that they can get away with anything, the thing I described in the beginning.  But I'm also quite convinced that somewhere in this crowd there are people whose calculation works something like this.  It would be to our political advantage to have a number of young people shot by the United States government.  It would be to our political advantage in the same way that Kent State was to the political advantage of the people who were trying to stop the war in Vietnam.  There are people out there, we see it with the Palestinians all the time, and we see it with Iranians and a bunch of other unsavory people, who understand that the power of seeing 18, 19, 20-year-old kids covered in blood being dragged off of a government facility helps them paint Donald Trump as a fascist and a Nazi and so on, and they're more than happy to spend other people's blood in order to make that point.  That's what I suspect is driving the actual... you know, no, we're really going to do it kind of thing, especially now that you tell me about the guy who had the original idea and is backing out.  He sounds like he was just kind of goofing off.  But people took a hold of it, and young people have to have a cause to protest, Scott.  That's all they do.  That's all they know how to do, and it's all they've been allowed to do.  The only thing that this generation has ever been encouraged to do is protest things.  They're not encouraged to start their own business, not encouraged to succeed individually.  All they know how to do is protest things.  And this is the ultimate protest against the military industrial complex.  So I'm sure they think it's a lark.  And if I had to predict the most likely case, most likely case would most of them swear they're going to be there and then they're going to sleep late that day and not show up.  Some of them are going to show up and they're going to see what the desert looks like, especially in the summertime.  And they're going to realize it's not just stepping over a fence and walking into a building.  It's stepping over a fence and walking 15 miles to the buildings that are shimmering off in the distance.  That's going to deter a lot of people.  And the ones that are not deterred, are going to be deterred by whatever level of escalating force that the government decides to employ against them.  And I'm sure that will be non-lethal force, and I'm sure that non-lethal force will do it, but If it turns out, and I cannot imagine this happening, if it turns out that large numbers of people were willing to walk through clouds of tear gas and things like this, microwave stuff, and all the other non-lethal defenses that we have, rubber bullets and sandbags and all the rest of it, then it may become necessary for the government to fire some shots over people's heads.  And if they hear the bullets whizzing past their heads and they keep coming, If you have the luxury and the time, then you shoot for the legs.  If not, you're going to have to drop one or two people who are in the front of this running forward with their arms peeled backwards.  And that is what will happen.  And if it happens, the person responsible for this will not be the guy who said it would be a funny idea and certainly the people not responsible for this will be the people who walk past us sign audible warnings tear gas rubber bullets microwaves or whatever and and just simply refuse to stop.  that's not who will be responsible.  donald trump will be responsible.  be his responsibility that these that these kids were hurt or killed.  That's why it's happening, and that's why it's dangerous.  But one way or another, I can tell you what I am quite convinced will not happen.  I am quite convinced that Area 51 is not going to be overrun by a bunch of largely millennial people.  I'm quite convinced that this is not something that the government is going to back up on because if it does, there is no government anymore. ",

Because of all the things that I find almost unbearably hypocritical is listening to people like Chris Rock or John Cleese talk about how, that's unbelievable, I can't even do a college campus anymore without, I can't even tell a joke anymore on college without people booing and so on.  This lack of freedom of speech is just intolerable.  It's your progressive politics that put us there.  Those are the politics and those are the people you voted for.  All of you entertainers, all of you left-wingers have voted for a culture where victimhood trumps everything and outrage is the only coin of the realm.  And so the idea of telling a joke about something as we understood it, is finished among the left.  Among the right, we still have the ability to have a sense of humor about things.  And that's one of the many reasons why I'm convinced that they will not win.  They're a bunch of humorless, unhappy, miserable, angry people, and nobody likes them.  They can't joke about anything because to joke about something would be to lower the level of injustice in society and injustice is the lifeblood of the modern left.  It's all there is.  And since the real injustice has been gone for 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 years, Now they have to invent their own injustice and they can't do that and make fun of it at the same time.  So dark humor is finished for people who are willing to be silenced by these arbiters of morality, decency, and everything else.
