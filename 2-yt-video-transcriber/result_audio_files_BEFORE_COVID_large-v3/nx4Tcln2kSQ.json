I'm running, I'm running, never looking back no more.  I'm running, I'm running, never looking back no more.  I'm living in a city like life.  Sin is everywhere and Christ they forgot.  But my God is faithful, He heard my cry.  Then one night I seen the fire falling from the sky.  Never looking back, flee to the mountaintops And don't look back.  Flee to the mountaintops and don't look back Never looking back, flee to the mountaintops And don't look back.  Flee to the mountaintops And don't look back.  Remember Lot's wife.  I'm running, I'm running Never looking back no more, no.  I'm running, I'm running Never looking back no more, no.  I'm running, I'm running Never looking back no more, no.  I'm running, I'm running Never looking back no more, no.  Remember how King Saul fell.  Remember how Solomon turned.  With all that wisdom he still fell.  The question is, will you learn?  Don't let him take your crown The crown of righteousness.  Don't let him take your crown.  I'm running, I'm running, never looking back no more.  I'm running, I'm running, never looking back no more, no.  Like a bird who strays from his nest, or a man who strays from his home.  Like the story of the prodigal son, who was lost and came back home.  When you find Jesus Christ, you'll truly find your home.  Come back to Jesus Christ.  Never looking back, I'm running, I'm running.  Never looking back no more, no I'm running, I'm running.  Never looking back no more, no I'm running, I'm running.  Never looking back no more, no I'm running, I'm running.  Never looking back no more, no Yeah. ",
