I overheard this while I was doing something else.  And I'm like, is this girl for real?  Is she really making an excuse for her brother getting shot after robbing a store?  In the course of robbing a store.  He's literally robbing people.  And the dude... Believes that his life is in danger and he shoot him.  Mind you, these two black people, you can't put a race card on this one.  But her brother go in the store and rob it and get shot.  And she literally gets on the TV and says the craziest thing you've ever heard.  Listen to this so we can hear the foolishness together.  Let's listen.  Not what? ",

            "text": "Right and wrong is wrong.  That was wrong for that clerk to shoot my brother in the chest.  Yes, he's robbing y'all.  Oh, well.  Call the police.  That's what y'all supposed to do.  Y'all not supposed to take matters into y'all own hands.  If that's the case, I'll take matters into my own hands.  Yes, he's robbing y'all.  But you ain't have to defend yourself.  Don't take matters in your own hands.  Call the police.  Let him rob you.  And then call the police.  Well, young lady, how do you not know that the clerk believes wholeheartedly that he's going to get shot in the course of this robbery?  He's not supposed to think he's going to get shot.  It's just this is the movies.  You don't get shot at the end of this.  No, that's not the case.  And I'll say this.  This just put this in context.  This convenience store had been robbed several times before this.  They believe that the suspect, who was her brother, has been involved in multiple robberies in the area.  So I don't know where these people get it.  I mean, clearly, these people probably have some mental problems, whatever.  But I had to laugh at the fact of her saying.  I know he got some responsibility, but not all.  And then I know he robbing y'all.  Oh, well, come on, man.  If you live a life like that and you believe that to be a reasonable way of thinking, you're probably not going to go very far in life.  And RIP to this young man.  But I want everybody else to know, look, when you rob a store, when you play stupid games, you get stupid prizes.  It could end in loss of life.  This is more common than people are led to believe.  There's an epidemic of individuals who refuse to take responsibility for their actions.  They want to do the crime, but don't want to do the time.  They want to harm people, but they don't want to get hurt in the process.  And this type of a mentality starts when people are very, very young.  When you don't bring that belt out and you don't show your children consequences or at least reasonable consequences for their actions, this is what they turn out to be.  This is how they turn out to be.  This is why they end up robbing people because they honestly believe that it doesn't matter if they rob you.  You should just let them do it.  And there's other videos.  I don't think this family is the same.  It's another family.  I heard that a brother or family was robbing somebody and they said he needed that money.  We deserve to be out here robbing people because we hungry.  That's not an excuse.  Trust me.  It's not an excuse.  Y'all let me know what you think, man.  Is this funny or am I tripping?  Should I not be making fun of this?  Y'all let me know in the comment section.  Like and subscribe to the channel.  Make sure you visit the Officer Tatum store.  Hit the bell.  What am I missing?
