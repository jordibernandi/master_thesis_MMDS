And when I saw the candidates lined up and I saw him, the Lord sent my hands on him, I'm going to use him as a wrecking ball and he's going to win.  And everybody said I was crazy.  You know, but listen to this.  Jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 10.  Then the Lord put forth his hand that touched my mouth.  And the Lord said to me, behold, I've put my words in your mouth.  See, I have this day set you over the nations and over kingdoms.  Watch this now.  To root out, to pull down, to destroy, to throw down, and then build and plant.  Well, every most minister wants to build and plant, but you can't build and plant if you don't root out, pull down, destroy, and throw down.  If you're going to build, you're building here.  You have to clear all this stuff out of the way.  So it's all the stuff that's already been built that we need to blow it up.  You know, I said the president, thank God, is a wrecking ball.  Yes.  Angela Merkel just said this a few months ago.  She said Trump has all but destroyed the new world order.  So this is why they are frantic to stop the agenda because it's setting the new world order back decades.  If he gets another four years, they actually the Lord.  OK, so I mean, there's so much.  Oh, wow. ",

            "text": "Okay, so watch this now.  I'm just coming from the spiritual angle first.  So in 2008, we were going to the city of Phoenix to have a great awakening.  But there were 600 churches coming together.  But we would have to rent a big arena.  And the Lord said, no, divide the city into five areas.  Do north, south, east, west, and central Phoenix.  Right.  And go in there, and we trained 2,600 people to win souls, and we took them on the streets during the day and saw 46,000 people saved during that 15-day period.  And then the nights.  Praise God.  A meeting, okay?  So the nights are an upper room where people get empowered, and then the day they go on the streets.  They hit the schools, universities, retirement homes, hospitals, military bases, really everywhere people are, and they confront people with the gospel because Islam is radically... transforming our country, and the church is sitting in a little holy huddle with a one-hour dry cleaning service on Sunday morning, in by 10, out by 11, three hymns, three hymns, take up the offertory, preach from the Encyclopedia Botanica, the Reader's Digest, then they pronounce the last rites, and everybody goes home.  just dead is what they came.  And nobody's doing anything Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, so they're coming to hear a message that they're actually going to do nothing with.  The message empowers us to take territory in the area that God's called us.  So watch this.  On a Monday night, I was in a Lutheran church preaching, and I began to prophesy.  Now, the word prophesy means to bubble forth, to tumble forth, to spring forth.  So it's not coming out of your head.  It comes out of here.  And as I was speaking, this is October 2008.  And I heard the Lord say, these are words I don't even use.  So I was waiting to hear what the next sentence was.  I heard the Lord say, tell the church to speak to the son.  For the sun is fast setting on the horizon of time.  But just like Joshua, come on, the sun and the moon to stand still.  So you'll speak, and I'll give you one more hour, for there's not a day left.  So I immediately calculated, if a thousand years a day, days a thousand years, then an hour is 40 years.  I said, okay.  And that's 10, 11 years ago.  So I said, okay, that's going to put me in my late 80s.  Okay, I'm ready.  I've got the hour.  So everybody says it's done, but it's not done.  We are here, and as long as we are here, the devil... We do all-night prayer meetings in our church.  The first Friday of every month is an all-night prayer meeting from 6 to 6 in the morning.  We've been doing all-night prayer meetings, and we pray.  We take authority over this.  So some people don't realize the power of prayer.  The devil's not going to have this country.  And everybody says, well, God's destroying America and whatever.  If God destroyed it, you wouldn't find it because go look at Sodom and Gomorrah.  You can't find it.  It's like they said, well, God was judging New Orleans.  Amazing how Bourbon Street was still intact after it.  So God said to the angels, what happened?  They said, sorry, Lord, we missed the coordinates somehow.  You know, here's the thing.  Things are happening in the earth, but God's actually standing with arms wide open.  This is the time of the ark with the gangplank down.  The day of judgment's coming, but it's not just yet.  And God's not going to destroy America because you and me are here.  Well, he loves us.  He's not going to kill us.  We're his children.  And so we pray.  And God doesn't do anything until we pray.  So we pray.  So we pray.  And God, give us a last-minute reprieve.  That's what we have.  We have a last minute reprieve, but we have to mobilize the church to hit the towns and the cities and the villages of this country and take territory.  So then, of course, I had to start preaching on these things to tell people why you had to do it, to show them the condition in the natural, because many people have no clue.  They don't know what's going on.  And so... Hence the book, The Killing of Uncle Sam.  And the next one that's coming out called Killing the Planet.  And the third one will come out next year called Killing the Church.  So people can understand why we're in the condition that we're actually in. ",
