            "text": "I've said it before and I'll say it again.  The 666 gang is running scared.  They went entirely too far in censoring the American voice.  But I must stop myself.  Is there even an American voice left standing?  I have to argue that there is not.  Ask any stupid American on the street this question.  Do you know... that congressmen must pledge their allegiance and sign a pledge form after getting elected and pledge their allegiance to Israel.  Do you know this?  Most Americans will look at you like deer in the headlights syndrome.  I mean, they just won't believe you.  Trust me, I've asked many people.  The first response I get is, come on, please.  It's just unbelievable that in America, that the first thing they ask you to do when you win the election, that the American people voted for you, and the first thing they ask you to do when you arrive at the House of Representatives, is you as a congressman must sign a form pledging your allegiance to a foreign power.  I mean, it's just unbelievable.  Americans, quite frankly, don't even believe it.  I mean, so, okay, what happens if you don't sign the pledge?  Well, that's easy.  Mainstream media will destroy you.  They'll pummel you.  I mean, you've seen it happen.  Did you see what they did to Ron Paul?  I mean, they're trying to destroy this woman as we speak.  I mean, case in point.  Enter freshman congressman or congresswoman Omar, I mean, who apparently has the iron will and the fortitude of her namesake, the military general Omar Bradley.  I mean, she's got some cojones here.  And this is what she said.  I mean, why do I have to pledge allegiance to Israel?  I mean, it's a legitimate question, I tell you.  Most Americans won't even believe it.  And you know what the worst part is?  I mean, how sad is this?  That in America, it takes a lady, a young lady who was born in Somalia, no less, to question why do we have to pledge our allegiance to a foreign country?  I mean, don't you think it's a little strange that no American has brought this up before?  Oh, I mean, there's been a couple.  I mean, I forget that one lady.  There's another congressman, African-American lady.  She brought it up.  I mean, I'm pretty sure that she was mainstream media destroyed her and she was run out of Congress or pretty quickly.  I mean, OK, so a handful of people have done it.  But don't you think it's strange?  OK, I don't even think except for maybe Ron Paul.  How many American men have stood up to this tyranny?  Not very many.  And to make matters worse, instead of demanding why do we have to pledge our allegiance to a foreign country, do you know what the Fox News cult followers do?  They go on the attack.  I mean, how dumb do you have to be?  You really have to be creme de la creme of morons.  You've got to be an idiot on steroids to attack A lady who is merely asking a question that most Americans cannot even believe.  Why do I have to pledge my allegiance to a foreign power?  I mean, this is just unbelievable.  And yet Fox News morons will attack this lady.  I'm almost at a loss of words here.  So I will leave you with this.  Do you think that if you are a real, true, blue American and you're fighting for America, standing up for America, that you will get paid to stand up for America?  No.  You'll notice on my video that there's no advertisement.  But when you go to Fox News, you see that big advertisement there?  You can skip it if you like.  You notice Fox News, if you are attacking Ms.  Omar... you will have a big, big advertisement, and they will pay you.  The 666 gang will pay you if you attack Omar.  But if you stand up for America, if you fight for America, if you simply ask the simple question, why do I have to pledge my allegiance to a foreign power, they will attack you.  You will see no add-on here.  If there is an ad here, it's only because they're scared of us, and the 666 gang is running scared.  But I don't have any faith in them being scared of me.  No.  They watch me.  They spy on me.  They're alarmed by me, but they're not afraid of me.  What the 666 gang is scared of, they're scared that all the Americans are going to wake up one day.  And when the Americans do wake up, trust me, that is going to be one scary day in America. ",
