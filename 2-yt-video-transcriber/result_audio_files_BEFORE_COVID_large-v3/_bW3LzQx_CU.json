            "text": "Do I think this latest impeachment inquiry is another witch hunt?  Of course.  But Mr.  President, you're handing them the pitchfork.  Stop!  It's time for final thoughts.  Well, just when we thought the Mueller investigation saga was coming to somewhat of an end, this happens.  Well, it looks like all they've done is trade Russia, Russia, Russia for Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.  Oh, goody.  But this whole outcry stems from a whistleblower complaint about a phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine.  In the now-released official summary of that phone call, a call President Trump assured us was friendly and totally appropriate, we see that President Trump did ask the Ukrainian president for a favor.  Part of that insinuated favor may be interpreted to mean look into possible Biden family corruption.  Now, the president's language, the phone call, and the appropriateness of that phone call aside, there is a very real and unresolved issue involving Joe Biden's actions as vice president.  Essentially, the question remains whether former VP Biden abused his own power to discourage Ukraine from investigating a crime that could involve his son, Hunter.  This is something that should be investigated.  Don't get me wrong, as the former VP of the United States and current Democratic front runner, Joe Biden should be under a microscope because Lord knows President Trump certainly is and has been since day one, which is exactly why I say President Trump What were you thinking?  President Trump knows anything and everything he does will be analyzed and reanalyzed and magnified and blown up and exacerbated and exaggerated and used against him, whether it's fair, legal, false, or whatever.  Why give the Democrats any ammunition whatsoever?  I don't get it.  The whole Biden family corruption mess should be investigated, but for the love of God, Mr.  President, you didn't have to get your hands or even your pinky finger dirty in this at all.  I am so frustrated, and so are many Trump supporters who have been by this president's side as he's been harassed, antagonized, and railroaded with fake news and nonstop BS.  Before this latest nonsense, the 2020 election was a slam dunk for President Trump.  I mean, have you seen the economy, the unemployment rates, the business confidence, the improvements at our southern border, oh, and the Democratic candidates?  This next election should have been like taking candy from a bunch of socialist wannabe babies.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I don't think President Trump will be impeached and I don't think he'll lose the election.  I just wonder why he would go ahead and make it harder for himself and why he would take any Democratic bait at this point.  There is no need to do it, Mr.  President.  I'm hoping we can get the Trump train back on the tracks and I'm pretty sure we can, but if you're like me, you wish we didn't have to go off the tracks by our own hand in the first place. ",
