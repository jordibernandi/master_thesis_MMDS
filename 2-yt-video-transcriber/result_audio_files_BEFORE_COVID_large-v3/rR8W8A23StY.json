The salaries of doctors in America is higher than everywhere else, except for maybe Luxembourg, which is a tiny tax haven.  And when you look at their salaries being higher, that also means they're probably doing more testing because a lot of their salaries are based on how they get the bill going up.  They get cuts of that.  How do you reduce that salary to levels of other countries to make this work?  And also relate that to how doctors in America have to borrow all this money.  They come out of school now.  I've got a client with a huge loan portfolio, costs from residency, and only now is starting to make this gravy train money.

We have 29 million people uninsured in this country.  We have 44 million people who are underinsured, which means they have insurance, but with the gaps and the coverage so big, it's as if they aren't insured at all.  35% of Americans go without needed care due to cost.

I am obviously going to be the opposite of Adam on this, and my question to you is, Why can't the free market work?  I'll give you an example.  The only area inflation-adjusted in the medical community where prices have actually come down is the only area where the market is allowed to work, and that's plastic surgery.  I would argue that the medical market is basically a monopoly or an oligopoly in that the market cannot work at all.  Doctors like yourself probably can't advertise.  I can't compare prices.  I can't go into a hospital and know what I'm going to pay before I go out.  If the market can work like it does with auto insurance, there's no one out there that lacks for auto insurance, no matter their record, if they're willing to pay for it.  Why can't we do that in health care?  Why do you want to go to some centralized Soviet run Medicare for all that you know is going to be inflated cost? ",

You can't have a free market in health care.

            "text": "Incredibly impressive.  He nailed it, and it was like, you know, whatever.  I don't know how many people were there.  Four versus two or something like that?  Listen, it's actually easy to do what he's doing if you're familiar with all this information.  Because it's not like these guys are coming up with these highfalutin arguments that you're going to struggle to respond to.  It's all the same talking point bullshit responses.  Oh my god, it's going to cost so much.  Well, as Dr.  Gaffney points out there, no, the cost would go down.  They keep citing this... This libertarian-funded study, and even according to that study, it saves $2 trillion.  But when you go to a better study from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, that study says that over a decade, Medicare for All saves $5 trillion, not $2 trillion.  So they're just wrong when they say that.  How it is funded would be different, but overall, you are going to save money.  And then I love the what about the doctor pay argument.  It's like because one of his points was, oh, you have these doctors who are in massive amounts of medical debt and then they get finally get paid and you want to cut their pay.  But hold on now.  Another thing that we're pushing for is free college.  Would I include, for people who want to become doctors, free medical school in there?  Yes.  So you wouldn't be in a tremendous amount of debt.  And like, you know, Dr.  Gaffney said, you don't necessarily have to make it so that doctors are 100% going to be paid less.  You could take most of the savings out of the administrative costs because the administrative costs are ridiculous under our private health insurance system.  Okay.  And then one of the points, just scaremongering nonsense, doctors will no longer work.  That is true.  There are no more doctors in Canada, no more doctors in the UK, no more doctors in Australia, and every developed country in the world has no more doctors.  And then notice, after he defeats them on all of the quantitative, objective, you know, macro picture points, what happens?  One of them goes right to anecdotal story.  You know, this is something you're always going to run into.  If you're ever debating healthcare with somebody and you're talking about the actual numbers and you're talking about the facts and you're talking about the macro picture... When there's nowhere else to go on that front because they've been thoroughly defeated, they will pivot to an anecdotal story.  I remember my aunt's kid, wait, that makes them your cousin, never mind.  My great-grandma's friend went to a hospital in Canada and, oh boy, was it a bad experience.  Now, anecdotal stories is a general rule.  toss them in the garbage.  Because there's a reason why they defer to an anecdotal story, because they want something that seemingly proves their point without actually making their point using objective numbers, okay?  So usually throw them in the garbage.  But furthermore, you know, this happened with when I debated that guy Razorfist on the issue of healthcare.  Rest in peace, Razorfist.  And he, at some point, made this argument.  And my response was, even if what you're saying is true... In the United States of America, there's between 32,000 and 45,000 people who die every year because they don't have access to basic health care.  We just covered a story the other day.  $375,000 medication led to somebody dying at a young age because they couldn't afford it.  So they have these random anecdotal stories, and the reality is we could have fucking 45,000 of them.  There was somebody named Barbara who died because they couldn't get the health care they needed.  There was somebody named Steve who died.  We can go on and on.  But it's just usually when you're dealing with our side of this debate, We're a lot more honest, so I don't, like, do I know a zillion anecdotal stories about negative things happening in our private healthcare system?  No.  Because when I'm reading about this stuff, I care more about what do the actual, what do the objective numbers say?  What do the studies say?  Because that gives you a better picture of the reality, not some random anecdotal story where they try to pull at your heartstrings to make you feel like, oh!  I'm going to be a reactionary and say, this has now totally changed my view on healthcare.  No, you know what should totally change your view on healthcare?  The World Health Organization study that said the United States is ranked 37th in the industrialized world.  That should change your view on healthcare.  Every study that's been done on this issue which finds that the top 10 is riddled with single-payer systems.  The Commonwealth Fund study which found that out of the 11 nations that they looked into, the United States was 11 out of 11 in terms of our healthcare system.  That should change your mind because that takes into account all of the individual cases because it's an objective study as opposed to if you just do an anecdotal story, you could make an anecdotal story for any position you want.  You can come up with an anecdotal story.  So it's just sad what they have to revert to in order to try to win this debate.  But either way, great job by Dr.  Andrew Gaffney there.  Hey man, listen, we're at the point now where we're actually having these debates and these discussions on Fox Business and on Fox News and hopefully in other places as well.  The more we get the word out there, the more we talk about this stuff, the better, because we are going to change hearts and minds, and we are going to let everybody know we do have an answer.  It's objectively better, and then eventually we'll beat these giant, powerful lobbies, the pharma lobby, the for-profit health insurance lobby, and we'll get our country to where we should have been all along.
