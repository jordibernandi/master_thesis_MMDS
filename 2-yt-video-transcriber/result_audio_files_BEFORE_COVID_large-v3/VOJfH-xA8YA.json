            "text": "There are 16 German Bundesl\u00e4nder, or states.  Three of them have elections coming up.  What makes these elections exciting is that it happens to be the three states where Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, or AFD, performs the best.  One of these states in particular could potentially result in both an explosive showdown with Merkel's CDU, as well as a showdown in federal court.  Saxon or Saxony and Brandenburg both have elections on September 1st.  Thuringian or Thuringia has their election on October 27th.  The AFD is still a fairly new party.  It was only officially launched in 2013.  During the first few years, there was some pretty serious infighting over the direction of the party.  Some of the original leaders quit.  The fighting was in part over whether the party would be dominated by economic issues or immigration.  In the end, I think the people who wanted to make immigration the main issue won out.  The AFD is currently part of the EU group spearheaded by Matteo Salvini called Identity and Democracy, or ID.  They originally joined the ECR back in 2014 when it was still dominated by the Tories.  Two years after letting them in, David Cameron famously tried and failed to kick them out of the ECR to appease Angela Merkel.  Compared to some of the other members of ID, the AFD probably has more traditional center-right economic policies.  Whereas the Finns Party, the Danish People's Party, and National Rally are big tent populists on economics, some conservatives even complain that these parties are too far to the left on economics.  although the AFD is probably a lot like the Austrian Freedom Party, which is also part of ID.  The AFD does far better in the six states of the former East Germany.  In fact, it seems they are starting to become a symbol of the continued cultural divide between East and West Germany.  In the 2017 German national election, AFD came in first place in Saxony with 27%.  In the 2018 EU election, the AfD came in first place in Saxony and Brandenburg.  Naturally, Berlin is the weak link in East Germany.  However, even in certain parts of Berlin, the AfD does very well.  The lion's share of AfD voters are former CDU voters.  Angela Merkel became the head of the CDU in the year 2000.  She has steadily pushed the party to the left ever since.  Far from being the extreme party that Merkel claims it is, the AfD is basically what the CDU was pre-Merkel.  In East Germany, there is also some working class voters who have switched from the left-wing parties to the AfD because of the issue of immigration.  In West Germany, there are two main left-wing parties, the Social Democrats and the Greens.  The Social Democrats are on the decline, and the Greens are on the rise right now.  In East Germany, there is a third prominent left-wing party.  Die Linke, which means the left, is the rebranded former East German Communist Party.  It is very left-wing.  However, it is the least preferred left-wing party of the globalists.  They are essentially a Euroskeptic party because of their anti-war positions.  They oppose giving the EU too much power because they believe the EU would initiate foreign wars.  In the rhetoric of the globalist think tanks, Die Linke is an unreliable partner for globalism, whereas the Green Party is Germany's most reliable partner.  There's an interesting side story with Die Linke.  A prominent leader of the party, Sarah Wagenknecht, has her own movement called Aufstehen, or Stand Up.  The goal of Aufstehen is to win back working class voters who have defected to the AFD.  Her movement opposes open borders in direct opposition to the official platform of Die Linke.  She could probably be compared to the new Prime Minister of Denmark, In 2016, Wagenknecht was even physically attacked by a self-described anti-fascist activist in the middle of a Die Linke conference.  Many of the people in East Germany I've talked to tell me that the Green Party is actually more radical and more dangerous than Die Linke.  Right now, the AFD is consistently polling 20-22% and have become first place in several polls in Brandenburg.  In Thuringia, they are also polling 20-22%.  In Saxony, they are consistently polling 25%.  The CDU is going up in the polls in Saxony right now, but it is not at the expense of the AFD.  According to the two latest polls, the CDU has surged to just over 30% by taking votes away from the left-wing parties.  I believe this is because Michael Kretschmer, the front man for the CDU in Saxony, has pivoted to the left.  He has publicly vowed to coalition with the Social Democrats and the Greens and block the AFD from entering government.  Kretschmer is now denouncing the AFD as an extreme party.  even though his own rhetoric in the recent past is very similar to the rhetoric of the AFD.  This is a dramatic reversal from what we were seeing from the Saxony branch of the CDU just a few months ago.  Prior to the EU election, they didn't even want Merkel to come to Saxony to campaign with them.  Now, instead of further distancing themselves from Merkel, they have gone in the opposite direction.  This could be dangerous for them as Saxony is widely considered to be one of the most conservative areas of Germany.  The election commission in Saxony also tried to rig the entire election.  The state parliament has 126 seats.  The AfD submitted 61 candidates.  43 were removed from the ballot by the election commission using very creative technicalities.  The courts in Saxony have restored 12 candidates, but candidates 31 through 61 are still being denied the right to be on the ballot.  If the AFD wins more than 30 seats, which is possible, the entire election might be nullified by the German federal courts.  Meanwhile, the media and the establishment parties are trying to whip people into a hysterical frenzy against the AfD.  Party members cannot even campaign without being harassed or even physically assaulted.  Nevertheless, this could prove to be a very exciting trio of elections in Germany.
