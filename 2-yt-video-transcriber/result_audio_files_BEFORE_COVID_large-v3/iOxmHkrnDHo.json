If you haven't seen that video, we got one of the captains over there decided to interrupt me.  I hate when they interrupt me, like, right in there.  Oh, look at that.  We got a Punisher thin blue line sticker.  And you know what that means.  It means I want to kill you with my thin blue line.  Unfortunately, I think that's what the Punisher thinks.  If it doesn't, leave it in the comments.  Let me know.  We got another person over there in that section.  Those guys over there Three of them out there.  So many of them over there out sitting and watching this way, like four of them.  Let's see if they have a complaint form over here.  Do you have officer complaint forms here or is it just over there?  Right here?  That's it.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  Is the sheriff available at all?  He's always in a meeting.  Don't say it.  All right, thank you.  Do you see me?  do the shirt pull and turn?  Yeah.  He's looking suspicious.  I'm like, I'm not suspicious here.  I have no weapons on me.  Oh my gosh, yeah.  See how it works?  Yeah.  Yeah, over at the corrections area over there, there's like three or four people standing around.  There's one guy at the corner like peeking around.  I turned towards him and he backed up and went away.  I'm just going to see if they have one of these.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be right back.  Is it?  Okay.  Are you doing one?  Whenever you're done.  Bouncing back and forth between both to expedite this.  If she comes back, I'm just going to do a quick one.  I'll be right back.  So sorry to bug you.  I was going to see if I can get just a number of people that were arrested yesterday, January 1st, right?  Yeah, see how many total were arrested.  That'd be awesome.  I don't think so.  Yeah, everybody's alerted.  She's on the phone telling someone that... Yep, they're over here.  I know, I was walking out, and I literally... I literally was just saying, all right, this is EOC.  They do a great service here, this and that.  And he's like, what are you guys doing?  You're suspicious.  I'm like, I'm sorry, you interrupt me?  Like, that's your MO to be like... Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, hey, that's why I'm capping whatever his name is.  Ah, Bob.  Ah, yeah.  Let me jump back over here.  How's she doing?  Hey, I think she's laying around the corner.
