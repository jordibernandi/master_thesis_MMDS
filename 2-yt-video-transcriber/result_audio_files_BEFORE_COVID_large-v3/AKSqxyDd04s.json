I mean, you tap your card in the corner store, and a bit stream goes through.  a dozen companies, each with their own computer systems, some of them being 1970s mainframes, older than many of the people in this room.  And three days later, a settlement occurs.  Well, with a blockchain financial industry, there would be no settlement because the payment and the settlement is the same activity.  It's just a change in the ledger.  So Wall Street and all around the world, the financial industry is in a big upheaval about this, wondering, can we be replaced or how do we embrace this technology for success? ",

            "text": "This is a fundamental new piece of our financial infrastructure.  Ripple is focused on building, using blockchain, an alternative to the ACH system that banks currently use to transfer funds from one to another.  A study by Banco Santander last year concluded that banks worldwide could save up to $20 billion each year if they used a blockchain instead of ACH to conduct their internal transfers.  Because remember, Ripple always was different from Bitcoin in that you could put anything of value in it, right?  So this idea of kind of, we would call it IOUs or balances, but really being value agnostic and that then being the engine for the exchange of that thing of value.  But having the combination of ILP with XRP, we think that's kind of the killer formula.  Now you can have any type of value, like any currency, but also any type of ledger.  So like anything from a centralized ledger to a blockchain.  And if we look at kind of stepping way back, kind of the macro problem that we think, again, the world has is lack of an internet of value.  You kind of argue that this gets to the heart of the problem with globalization, which is obviously under a lot of stress today, right?  It's kind of not working for a lot of people.  And we kind of, we don't think of it as like, well, globalization's bad.  We think of it, globalization's actually incomplete.  Until you have an internet of value, you really can't have true globalization.  You sort of need these three core interoperability technologies working all together.  You need interoperability of data, of goods, and money.  And then we think really good things happen when the world finally has a full kind of globalization platform.  But this has to happen.  And again, what is this meaning now?  that we don't have it right now?  It means, you know, we all know sending 50 bucks to Europe is kind of impossible, right?  The example of the Airbnb host in Tanzania who should be making $29 on a rental, and by the end of the day, $9 is showing up.  This is an actual example, right?  So around payments, we think XRP is uniquely and extremely well positioned to solve that payments problem.  It's extremely fast, about three seconds per transaction, and it costs about a thousandth of a penny.  to actually enable that transaction.  So we often make the point that while Bitcoin is very profound in solving that store of value, an XRP transaction is about a thousand times faster and about a thousand times cheaper per transaction.  Other startups are working to connect non-cash assets to blockchains.  Things like stocks, futures, houses, cars.  And because we have total security on the blockchain, this new form of titling system could replace the paper and personnel heavy system that we have now.  thanks to creativity, new industries, new jobs will be created.  The big challenge for me, from what we see at 100,000 customers we have in 60 countries, is the speed of the transition, because technology is making its inroad extremely fast.  And the question, the challenge is how does society, companies and employees adapt to this acceleration of technology inroad?  So the key challenge is about the speed and the way we transition from one system to the future of work.  The fourth industrial revolution is just beginning and a new economy is emerging.  And you're here because that new economy demands a new finance.  A new finance to serve the digital economy, a new finance to support the major transitions underway across the globe, and a new finance to increase the financial sector's resilience. ",

So, could we ... develop some new approaches to this problem of inequality, because the only approach today is to redistribute wealth, tax people and spread it around more.

I don't understand how a car works, but if it parks for me, that would be even better.  And I think it's the same kind of thing.  But what they are seeing is they are seeing payments arrive in one hundredth of the time, and they're paying a lot less, if anything, for it.  And I think that's the key.  So when you're looking at high volume payments for companies involved in import, export, or remittances, or whatever the case may be, when you start to look at the economics of how they stack in favor of a Ripple payment over xRapid, perhaps rather than Swift, the numbers are actually quite eye-watering.  And in terms of the usability, the client is seeing an optimized outcome.  So it's quicker and easier to make, and it's cheaper for sure.  But there's nothing that they have to do in addition to what they were already doing to instruct it. ",

Because at the moment, what we have is we have the SWIFT system, which everybody understands its boundaries, its constraints.  And effectively, what we're doing is we are making banks into exchanges for payments.  But where I think with xRapid there's a real opportunity is that there is the chance for anybody to join this network.  And in that sense, work perhaps with the banks and take a bit of the load off them.  But there's no reason why, for example, two people couldn't be members of the xRapid network.  And we wouldn't necessarily have to go through a clearing bank or more.  which just makes the speed of transfer so much faster.  And if that means that more people join the global economy and we get an uplift out of poverty, and if we bring more countries into trading with the rest of the world, that can only be a good opportunity as far as I see it.

It's very difficult for them to get hold of dollars in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  So we need to make it easy to move funds as easily and as cost-effectively as possible.  You'll notice the four Vs that we have on there.  The first one, velocity and speed.  Speed is absolutely important here.  The speed of transmission, the speed of settlement, to understand how quickly we can move a transaction in a trusted way from one correspondent to another.  The volumes.  In trade, we're looking at low volume, high value.  However, our drive in the bank is to move more towards high volume, low value.  We're picking up more customers with lower values, but with many more of them in the market.  Veracity is knowing and trusting what's happening in the background.  At the conference I was at yesterday, they were saying a bank can't even trust another bank when you're doing trade.  So not only send me an instruction, send me a confirmation as well.  because I don't trust you.  Now, if banks don't trust each other, how can we ensure that a client, a corporate client, is gonna get the best value when they're doing a particular trade activity?  Last one there is the value.  How can we ensure value right across the chain?  Am I going to get penalized when my goods arrive in a port?  Everything was fine, I know what the final value should be, and then suddenly I'm hit with either a tariff, I'm sanctioned by some particular authority, and suddenly the value of my goods The value may stay the same, but the price I'm paying is completely different.  And again, in emerging economies in Africa, in the Far East, in those areas which we serve, it becomes very difficult for those clients to be competitive in the market. ",
