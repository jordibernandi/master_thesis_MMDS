Last time it was mainstream media.  Remember, no way Trump wouldn't could win, really.  And so we saw, but here I didn't feel like they were talking about a legitimate poll meeting Trump.  I don't know where they exactly what level I want to go with that, but it didn't sound good.  because what's at stake Biden?  and who allowed Biden to do all of his deeds, Obama. ",

And they relifted the autonomy of it this week.  And they I mean, they really went in there, saw images of, you know, after they cut the Internet and everything like that.

It all falls down to that Silk Road project.  I mean, we're talking biblical wartime infrastructure.  And for, you know, it's the same thing with the South China Sea area.  China cannot afford to lose any of that infrastructure, just like we saw in Venezuela.  They got, you know, they're banking big to get.  There's another headline that came out.
