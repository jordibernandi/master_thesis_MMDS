            "text": "You know, how far is the mental illness going to go before men and women who are tired of this nonsense we know as feminism, when the pushback will happen?  Is it going to happen soon?  I don't know.  I think maybe some people won't learn until we hit rock bottom, and I don't know when that's going to happen, if it'll ever happen.  I was going to run the audio of this.  It's a CBS This Morning news story.  But sometimes the news outlets get a little pissy about their copyrights.  Plus, I'm lazy, so I'm just going to read the story.  Women claiming sexual harassment at Yale.  fraternities take unexpected legal action.  Three female students are suing Yale and nine of its fraternities, asking a federal court to force fraternities to accept women as members.  Okay, that's the least offensive of this story right there.  These women accuse Yale and the fraternities of allowing quote, dangerous environments in which sexual misconduct thrived, end of quote.  They said fraternity houses, get this now, dominate a limited social scene around campus.  One that needs to be wiped clean.  of sexual harassment and gender discrimination reports.  CBS News Meg Oliver.  Where's Yale located?  They're in New Haven, Connecticut.  Oh my God.  Can you even imagine there are a bunch of places to go socialize in New Haven, Connecticut?  Who would have thought?  In a college town.  In a Yale town, there's a bunch of places for people to go to hang out.  Oh, but no.  No, no, no, no.  No, these women claim that fraternities dominate a limited social scene around campus.  Anna McNeil, Ellie Singer, and Rye Walker say they've had enough of inappropriate behavior by men at Yale fraternity parties and ask whether they've been sexually assaulted... They've been raped.  All three raised their hands.  No, listen to the audio.  A couple of them said they were groped, which is theoretically sexual assault.  And one was dry humped on the dance floor.  Call in the National Guard.  And yet, with Title IX, these ladies could have called the Title IX office and got these men removed from college because of what they did.  Did they?  No, of course not.  Because it probably didn't happen.  Someone pulled up a chick's skirt.  I was groped and dry humped.  Okay, whatever.  In a lawsuit, they claimed, quote, female undergraduates risk sexual harassment and assault by attending the fraternity events, end of quote.  They said men deny female students admission, dot, dot, dot.  based on their appearance, verbally harass them, grind against them, grab them, and grope them, end of quote.  And Ms.  Oliver asks a question here that you might not expect.  Quote, Why do you want to be part of a culture that you're alleging promotes sexual misconduct?  McNeil said, A fraternity party wasn't any of our first choice, but it was kind of the only choice for the first couple of months at school.  Hmm.  Okay, so these Czechs are alleging that all this raping is going on at these frat parties.  Well, they don't say that, but when you say sexual assault, you see, you're supposed to assume that means rape, because that's how the language has been changed.  Welcome to Newspeak, people.  Sexual assault can be groping, or I suppose dry humping, or unwanted kiss, that kind of thing.  But they don't want you to hear anything about that.  They want you to believe it's rape, right?  My guess would be these girls never went to a frat party.  You know why?  Because they also say in their lawsuit here, well, people are judged on their appearance before they're let into these parties.  These chicks got nowhere near a frat party.  They probably walked by and, oh my God, I bet they're getting raped in there.  We better report this and have a lawsuit.  Un-fucking-believable.  Walker continues, it speaks to the way that fraternities dominate the social culture at Yale.  Like I said, I just looked in New Haven, Connecticut.  There's restaurants, bars.  This is Yale, people.  Are you telling me there's nowhere to fucking go in New Haven, Connecticut at night as a college student at Yale where you can socialize with your friends?  Bullshit.  Now, maybe what these girls are saying, and I would bet my money on it, they couldn't go anywhere to socialize to drink because they were only 18.  Yeah?  Yeah, you think?  Walker says, fraternities are the places that are open late at night.  And those are the spaces that some of our friends are hosting parties in.  Oh, so you're friends with the rapists.  Oh, those are the good guys.  Those aren't the evil misogynist rapists at Yale.  Fraternities offer a vast network of privileges to their members.  They offer connections.  They offer help networking.  Not for you three anymore.  I'd be surprised if anybody will even talk to you.  Their lawsuit against the Illinois fraternities argues separate but equal.  Greek life reinforces gender norms, stereotypes, and prejudices.  They're seeking class action status, asking the courts to award damages, of course, and to order policy changes, including, quote, fully integrating women at Yale's fraternities.  Oddly, there's no counter-lawsuit integrating males into sororities, is there?  Would you expect such nonsense?  Of course not.  It's unfair, because we want to be a part of the rape culture as well at these parties, so... It's almost un-fucking-believable, some of this bullshit.  CBS News legal analyst Rikki Kleinman said the case is enormously complicated.  That's a nice way to put it.  She's confused by what she sees as the lawsuit's contradictory goals.  Are you surprised?  Rikki, the lawyer.  Ricky, that's the entire goal of feminism is to be contradictory.  We bitch about Emma Watson showing her tits in a photo shoot, yet the same people the next day will be marching in protest to show their tits out in public.  Do you see?  Oh my God.  God.  Quote, if I am someone who goes into a party at the only place available for me to socialize, which is a fraternity, and I am being groped and sexually assaulted, and in an environment that I think is unsafe, why do I want to join the fraternity?  Why don't I want the fraternity?  Man, here's a better thought process, Ms.  Kleiman.  Why even go to these rape-infested frat parties?  if you know this bad shit is happening all over the... You know why?  Because it's not.  You see, this is another fantasy.  These women are thinking, oh my God, they won't let me to the frat party because I'm not very attractive.  So I'm just going to make up some shit and file a lawsuit.  The women are part of a group which has repeatedly filed complaints.  Oh, the shock.  asking Yale to regulate fraternities.  Quote, Yale's response has been deliberately indifferent.  Yale has known about the problem of fraternity-related discrimination and sexual misconduct for at least a decade.  Discrimination, fraternity-related discrimination, they don't let ugly girls into the party.  Pledges of one fraternity allegedly posing for a photo outside the Yale Women's Center with a sign reading, we love Yale sluts.  Now, why would that be a problem?  They're not slut-shaming.  They're saying, no, we love them sluts.  Oh, of course it's a problem.  Because reasons?  Another fraternity was banned after pledges reportedly paraded around chanting no means yes.  A third fraternity faced allegations of turning away women of color because they wanted white girls only.  Uh, well, maybe the fraternity has a preference for white women or black women or Asian women.  Oh, that's right.  That would be a fetish.  See, if they only wanted Asian women, that would be a fetish.  Oh my God, people.  And these people vote, by the way.  In a statement, Yale University told us, CBS that is, they have no comment on the lawsuit, but said, all students are subject to discipline for sexual misconduct through Title IX, of course.  A lawyer representing all the fraternities told us the claims are baseless and unfounded.  and that they look forward to vigorously defending this action in court.  This case focuses only on fraternities at Yale, but other schools no doubt will be watching and laughing at how fast this is tossed out.  I'm ugly.  I can't get into a frat party.  And if I get into a frat party, some guy approaches me that doesn't meet my standards.  I'm going to sue.  Oh, my God.  Link below.  Please watch the video and just look at the future female.
