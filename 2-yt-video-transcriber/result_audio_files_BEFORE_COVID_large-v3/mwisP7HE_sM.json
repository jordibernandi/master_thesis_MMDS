            "text": "Hi, my name's Tom.  Welcome back to my channel and to another episode of Politics, my series in which we take a look at Netflix, politics and the point at which the two meet.  Today, I'm going to slightly stretch the usual Netflix Originals-only focus of this series in order to take a look at Michael Schur's The Good Place.  In today's video I'm exclusively going to focus on season one of the show.  I particularly didn't want to spoil the season one finale but if even looking at just season one is a bit too much for you then this is your kind of fair spoiler warning.  In particular, I'm interested in how the moral framework which fuels much of the dramatic tension of this series, as well as setting up many of its gags, might be read as a reflection of popular perceptions of different social classes.  It's worth me saying before I kick off that I really like this show and it is out of love for it that I kind of take it to task here rather than because I want to see it hashtag cancelled or anything.  As always, if as we go along you find yourself massively agreeing or disagreeing with something I'm saying then please do feel free to let me know down in the comments, it's really interesting to have those conversations and if cultural analysis, video essays and other similar things are kind of your bag then please do consider subscribing.  With that out of the way, however, let's take a look at The Good Place.  So, The Good Place, created by Michael Schur, centres on Eleanor Shellstrop , who we meet moments after her death and her subsequent arrival in the afterlife.  Unlike the vast majority of humans, Elinor has landed herself a spot in the Good Place, which is expressly not heaven but, particularly in its opposition to the Hell-like Bad Place, works on a very similar principle.  The Good Place consists of a series of perfect neighbourhoods, curated to fulfil the specific desires and lifestyles of its like-minded residents.  Each resident, for example, is given a home reflective of their essence and is introduced to their soulmate in order that they can live out eternity in each other's company.  Very soon, however, we learn that the Eleanor Shell's shop that we have been introduced to is not the human rights lawyer and activist that Michael, the angel-like curator of this particular Good Place neighbourhood, thinks she is.  in fact, a significantly less virtuous ex-telephone salesperson whose life was characterised by narcissism and deceit.  In short, within the premise of the show, she should not be in the good place.  After debating revealing this error to Michael and thus sending Eleanor to eternal torture in the bad place, Eleanor's soulmate Chidi agrees to tutor her in ethics to make her a better person.  partly in order that she might not be found out, but also that she might be more deserving of her spot in the Good Place.  Along the way, we also meet Eleanor's neighbours, the incredibly wealthy philanthropist Tahani, played by Jameela Jamil, and the silent Buddhist monk Jianyu, played by Manny Jacinto, who, it turns out, has also ended up in the Good Place by accident and is actually Jason Mendoza, a somewhat simple-minded amateur DJ from Florida.  Thematically, then, The Good Place presents us with an explicitly moral inquiry.  Can bad people become good?  And what does it mean to be a morally good person, anyway?  In today's video, I'm not going to spend too much time discussing the show's treatment of ethics as either an academic or lived pursuit.  I think this has been covered really well elsewhere and, frankly, ethics is not my specialism.  Instead, I'm interested in considering what The Good Place might reveal about our tendency to conflate morality with social class and our tendency to consider those of lower social classes to be somehow inherently more morally suspect.  So, let's begin by taking a brief look at the moral framework which The Good Place presents us with.  Because, however much they might often hide in the background of a text, most narrative texts operate within some kind of moral framework.  Indeed, in The Writer's Journey, Christopher Vogler suggests that moral dilemmas that test the hero's beliefs and character and invite us to measure our own behaviour against that of the players in the drama are essential to any good story.  Generally speaking, we like seeing characters wrestle with questions of what is right and wrong.  Nevertheless, The Good Place is somewhat unique in that it presents us with a fairly blunt thesis statement as to what actions are considered morally good and morally bad within this fictional universe in the very first episode.  And by taking a look at Michael's orientation presentation, think we can make some interesting observations.  For, while some extreme cases are largely inarguable ending slavery or committing genocide, for example, being pretty clearly good and bad actions respectively, many of the others are, perhaps unsurprisingly, more contestable.  Supposedly virtuous actions include planting a baobab tree in Madagascar, politely tolerating a stranger or counting a New York article at a cocktail party, while immorality is assigned to actions such as buying a trashy magazine, using the term bro code, ruining opera with boorish behavior, and revving a motorcycle.  In short, the majority of the actions which are considered moral are ones which are only available to or which we are likely to associate with the middle and upper classes.  In contrast, those actions which are deemed immoral are those we are likely to associate with working-class people.  And, yes, we have to acknowledge that placing buying a trashy magazine alongside committing sexual harassment is very clearly a joke here.  Yet, I don't think that precludes us from asking why that joke works.  Because my argument would be that this joke does not operate on the basis that we will find the attribution of immorality to the buying of trashy magazines as a ridiculous suggestion.  Instead, it operates on the fact that that idea might ring true.  that we might, in fact, view buying a trashy magazine as a bad action.  The moral framework which decides whether one gains entrance to the good place or not then is not only inherently classist, it is also classist in a way that reflects the manner in which we often conflate morality and social class in the real world.  In order to explore this notion further, it's worth first taking a little step back to consider how class is both sustained and operates in contemporary society.  Because the very fact that we associate certain actions with certain social classes suggests that there is more to class than simply how much money one has.  At a very basic level, for example, how one speaks and how one conducts oneself is often very telling of what social class one belongs to.  Take Tahani and Jason.  Despite sharing a mansion in the afterlife, their mannerisms and accents clearly mark them out as being of different social classes.  Now, such surface-level attributes are fairly benign.  If one's accent and posture, say, were the only signifiers of class, then it would be relatively easy for Jason to pull an Eliza Doolittle changes mannerisms so as to pass as being from the same privileged background as Tahani.  Yet what is much harder to fake is one's interests and the certain forms of knowledge that one possesses.  The role that the activities we choose to take part in and our cultural interests play in placing us within a certain social class was explored at great length by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdeaux in his 1984 book Distinction.  Following five years of empirical research, he argued that there was a socially recognized hierarchy of the arts which corresponds to a social hierarchy of the consumers.  This predisposes tastes to function as markers of class.  What is key to stress here is Bordeaux's use of the term hierarchy.  Because, as we began to see in the example of the trashy magazine, we don't perceive the different activities that we associate with different social classes as being different yet equal.  Instead, the self-sustaining, hegemonic manner through which class divisions are reproduced in our society encourages us to consider the activities that we associate with the more privileged classes as being, in some way, intrinsically more worthwhile and virtuous than those we associate with the working class.  This comes directly into play in episode 6 of The Good Place, during which Tahani, Jason and Chidi go to the spa.  Tahani is keen to bond with Jason who, at this point, she still believes to be Jianyu, the Buddhist monk.  When she asks him who his favourite artist is, however, he responds with the rapper Pitbull.  Not quite the answer that Tahani, who was thinking more along the lines of the Impressionist painter Degas, was expecting.  Again, this gag works because, as a society, we consider Tahani's knowledge of the Impressionists to not only be different to Jason's knowledge of the oeuvre of Pitbull, but to be in some way intrinsically more valuable.  Bordeaux acknowledges this by arguing that this kind of knowledge of traditional highbrow culture forms what he refers to as cultural capital.  And, more than just a signifier of class, he suggests that cultural capital plays an active role in either enabling or barring one from joining a higher class, no matter how much money they have.  Say, for example, a working-class person wins the lottery or starts a startup which becomes insanely successful.  Although they might now have a considerable amount of economic capital, we tend to not suddenly perceive them as being members of the upper class because they don't necessarily carry themselves in that manner.  Therefore, their lack of cultural capital marks them out as not really belonging in that social group.  And, in a similar way, within the afterlife that The Good Place presents us with, everything is free.  And thus, if social class was solely a result of economic capital, class divisions would soon wither away.  The active role that cultural capital plays in defending class privilege, however, ensures that class divisions are all too persistent in the good place, and Eleanor and Jason, with their complete lack of cultural capital, consistently stand out.  Indeed, the actions which mark Eleanor and Jason out as not truly belonging in the good place are often drawn from a playbook of well-worn stereotypes of the working class.  Eleanor's drinking to excess at Tahani's welcome party, Jason's abundance of junk food in his bud hole, the fact that both of them, at separate points, decorate their living spaces with sexualised images all draw upon moralising stereotypes of working-class people as unable to control their base urges and, by extension, being in need of control and instruction.  Which brings us back to Eleanor's lessons with Chidi.  The central question of The Good Place is essentially, is it possible to teach someone who was previously somewhat self-serving in their actions to be more ethically virtuous?  Nevertheless, the inescapable class coding of morality in The Good Place means that, all too often, what the show really seems to be asking is, Is it possible to save a working-class person from the inherent moral ineptitude that is a part of their social class?  In doing so, the show again, perhaps unwittingly, continues a centuries-long process.  through which the middle classes in particular have used notions of morality and respectability, constituted entirely in their own terms, as a marker to distinguish themselves as moral individuals in contrast to the undeserving proletarian masses.  This is something explored at length by the sociologist Beverly Skeggs in her seminal book Formations of Class and Gender, which she opens with the argument that respectability is one of the most ubiquitous signifiers of class.  It informs how we speak, who we speak to, how we classify others, what we study and how we know who we are or are not.  Respectability is usually the concern of those who are seen not to have it.  Respectability would not be of concern if the working classes had not consistently been classified as dangerous, polluting, threatening, revolutionary, pathological and without respect.  When viewed through the prism of class, The Good Place can very much be read as the tale of a working-class woman trying to negotiate and adopt notions of respectability which are defined by the middle class.  Think of how, in episode 11, when Tahani helps Eleanor to throw an apology party, Eleanor has learnt how to behave respectably, sipping her drink suffering through dull conversation rather than, as she does in episode 1, letting loose and having a good time.  Furthermore, however, as Skeggs continues, this notion of respectability has been drawn upon throughout history as a way of distinguishing between different sections of the working class, some being savable and others too far gone.  This Victorian notion of the deserving and undeserving poor.  This notion, too, works its way into The Good Place in the clear contrast between Eleanor and Jason.  It seems that a clear binary is constructed, at least in season one, between Eleanor, who is able to overcome the moral limitations of her class, and Jason who, simply put, is not.  There is a moment in one of the flashbacks to Jason's Time on Earth where one of the police officers suggests that his death by suffocation in a safe was what he deserved.  And, yes, Jason has just attempted to commit a minor robbery but this is very much indicative of the manner that, in the real world, this lack of respectability is often used as a way of forgiving and legitimizing the much harder lives that working-class people have to lead.  In short, their lack of respectability means they deserve to have less.  To focus on one final element of all this, I think it's also interesting to interrogate the framing in episode 13 and, brief spoiler warning for those of you who have yet to watch the season finale, the revelation that Chidi and Tahani have also been misplaced into the Good Place and really belong in the Bad Place.  Because, throughout the series, the notion that Eleanor and Jason should really be in the Bad Place kind of goes unquestioned.  Whereas, when it's revealed that Tahani and Chidi should also be there, we're encouraged to see this as almost a miscarriage of justice.  particular, it's implied that Eleanor and Jason were intentionally immoral people on earth, whereas Tahani and Chidi we are encouraged to view as being well-intentioned, yet who perhaps either tried too hard or tried in the wrong ways.  For me, this kind of reverse moral relativism, in which we are encouraged to give more benefit of the doubt to those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds than we might give to working-class people, is highly indicative and really hammered home the show's conflation of morality with social class and its suggestion that being moral might come easier to certain classes than to others.  To wrap up then, certainly in subsequent seasons, the moral framework which we're presented with in episode one of The Good Place comes under increasing criticism from the characters of the show and from the show itself.  And I think there is definitely a productive argument to be made that the manner in which the focus slowly shifts from Eleanor attempting to live within that moral framework to a broader critique of the rigidity of that framework itself in some way redeeming of its earlier reliance on stereotypes of working-class people as being immoral.  There is also perhaps an argument to be made that this intrinsic linking of class and morality is so on-the-nose and played for laughs so much that it itself constitutes a critique of this notion.  In all honesty, I'm skeptical about both of those arguments.  I think it far more likely is that the creators of the show thought that a sitcom about ethics might not be overly appealing to a working-class audience and sort of saw the opportunity to take the mick out of them in their absence.  All this being said, I still really like The Good Place.  I think it is warm and funny and, in a similar way to what I try and do on this channel, I think it takes complex, potentially dull topics and makes them really engaging.  However, I think it's really important that even when we really love a TV program, a film, a book,  etc.,  that we still treat it critically and that, as we've done today, we consider how it might reinforce certain problematic assumptions and ideologies from our society.  Thank you very much for watching this video.  This particular video has been on my to-do list since I very first started planning the politics series so I hope you found it interesting and enjoyable.  If you do think it is a net positive for the world then please do consider giving it a thumbs up and, again, if you want to subscribe that'd be amazing.  Thank you very much for watching once again and have a great week! ",
