            "text": "Now, I know at the time when it was released, it caused a little controversy, but it was also very popular.  Some people thought she was using LGBT plus people as tokens.  And personally, I am very skeptical of cause marketing in general, femfatizing, using causes to make money, essentially.  But in all honesty, I do think Taylor Swift did a pretty decent job with the music video.  She showcased some awesome people, raised money for a fantastic cause, had a great message, and it was a pretty damn catchy song.  I'm not the biggest Taylor Swift fan, I find her music very hit and miss, but I really enjoyed the song, I really enjoyed the music video.  So, yeah, overall I thought it was pretty decent, but I can understand why some people weren't the happiest with it.  However, last night I found a young woman called Hannah on YouTube who, I definitely get vibes from her that she's trying to be very like, girl-defined, very Paul and Morgan, but she's still a small channel for now, so you know, be kind to her, go easy on her.  She had a different problem with the music video.  Hannah is a Christian girl who believes being gay is a sin and a choice, and she didn't like how homophobes and transphobes were portrayed in the video.  According to Hannah, apparently it is not okay to demonize people who are just innocently going around spreading hate and hurting others.  They're not doing anything wrong, except to all those people they're hurting, but it's not fair to criticize them for that.  So like I say, on the one hand she has a pretty small channel, so no sending hate her way, be nice to her please.  On the other hand, if you're gonna be homophobic or transphobic, I don't care how big or small your channel is, I'll call it out when I see it.  So let's take a look at Hannah's video. ",

Do y'all know which bitch she's talking about?  These couple of seconds.  And here's the thing, Taylor isn't mocking Christians.  She's mocking homophobes and transphobes who try and use the Bible to back up their hatred.  And I would honestly go as far as to say, they deserve to be mocked.  You're gonna spread hate, you deserve a little bit in return.  One critique I would give of Taylor is that in the video, she does portray a slightly too narrow view of what homophobes and transphobes and, you know, what those people look like.  They aren't all no-teeth idiots.  As we've seen from YouTube, often the people who are homophobic, transphobic, unwilling to spread these messages, they're articulate, they're beautiful, they're charismatic people, and that's what makes them all the more dangerous.  Because they have this charisma, they can build an audience, people look up to them and respect them.  so when you get someone like hannah who she seems lovely she's beautiful she's sweet and yet she's spewing hate but like portraying it as love that is so dangerous.  that's how the world gets messed up.  it's all said in love.

There was another sign that one of the protesters was holding and it said, get a brain morons.  The Christians in this video were dressed up as what I would call rednecks.

Being homophobic and transphobic and intolerant is stupid and ignorant, and that's why Taylor and the people who directed and made the music video wanted to portray them that way.  It's a personification of their views.  They're stupid, ignorant views, so they look like stupid, ignorant people.  I know I mentioned it before, and I think it's a little bit of a narrow portrayal of homophobia, but I see the point, I see why they were doing it.  It's showing how homophobes and transphobes don't have any legitimate arguments, they don't have any compassion for the people they're hurting, and it's a personification of that.  Taylor isn't making all Christians look stupid, she's not saying if you believe in God you're stupid, she's not saying if you're Christian you're stupid, she's simply saying if you're homophobic and transphobic and intolerant towards the LGBT plus community then your views are ignorant and stupid and therefore You are too.  She's not targeting all Christians, only the homophobic ones.  Yeah, if you have a problem with being portrayed as ignorant and stupid, maybe don't hold ignorant and stupid beliefs.  By which I mean, don't be homophobic.  It's that simple.  Next up, she plays a clip from Taylor's video and pops this lyric on screen, which I find kind of ironic because, um...

That's the difference.  That's the bottom line.  But then, Hannah just ends her video by reading some comments from her viewers, who also share her pretty disgusting views.  I find these replies really telling, especially the people who, like, refuse to watch the video and stuff like that.  It really makes me think that a lot of these people are just very happy to stay in their little echo chambers, they don't want to change, they don't want to be exposed to anything outside of their little worlds.  They can't stand to watch the people that they demonize in their heads as real people who are having fun and have lives and personalities and do all this great stuff.  It's easy to sit back in your home and have this idea in your head of like, ooh, gay people bad, transgender people bad, and so on.  But once you see them and you see the real people with the real personalities, you realise that being gay or transgender or anything else isn't a problem.  They're real people with individual personalities and they have good points to them and bad points to them and some of them are good people and some of them are bad people.  and I guess when you've lived a life so full of hate and judgment towards a whole group of people, it can be very jarring and difficult to see them as actual human beings like you.

It's just a part of who we are as people and it's not something we can control.  It's defined and decided by our genes, our biology.  It's an ingrained part of who we are and we can't change that.  It doesn't matter how angry a person gets, you can't change biology.  Just like you can't shout and shout and red will suddenly become blue, you can't shout and shout and expect someone to be less gay.  That's the point of the lyric.  It's not a dig at the people throwing shade, if you want to put it like that, it's almost like laughing at them for thinking that throwing shade in the first place is going to make any difference to something that you can't change.  The difference is when someone holds a hateful viewpoint with no evidence to back it up, like the homophobic and transphobic people portrayed in the video, like Hannah herself, often showing them how ridiculous they're being and why they're wrong, can help change their mind, and therefore throwing shade can make a difference, it can change something, because there's something there to change.  It's entirely different.  So no, I don't think Taylor's lyrics and what she does in the music video make her hypocritical.  I think Hannah here is just missing the entire point.  Interestingly, Hannah ends the video on a line which has very little to do with anything else, but I thought it was very interesting and worth mentioning.  She says this. ",

Whose families were torn apart by it.  whose genitals were damaged, whose childhoods were ruined.  Oh my God, so many good people whose lives were ruined by religion.  Ahana seems young and naive and idealistic, and often there's nothing wrong with that.  But when that naive idealism, I guess, results in her having hateful opinions, which she spreads around, that's when it becomes a problem.  And that's when it becomes our problem.  I do hope that she goes on to grow up a little, she goes on to go out and meet more people, people who come from different backgrounds, have different lifestyles, have different beliefs, and I hope she learns from them and realises that there's not only one right way to live your life.  I really hope she learns that.  But yeah, that is pretty much me done for today.  Please let me know down in the comments what you thought of Taylor Swift's video, you need to calm down, let me know what you think of Hannah's response to it, and let me know what you think about her ideas.  Is Taylor Swift being a hypocrite by saying, you know, Throwing shade never made anyone less gay and then throwing shade herself.  I've never said throwing shade before and now it's just everywhere.  I feel like I'm one of the cool kids.  Anyway, like I say, let me know your opinions.  Thank you for watching today.  I appreciate you guys so much and I'll see you again soon. ",
