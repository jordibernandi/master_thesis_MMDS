You know, most Muslims are actually Southeast Asian and Polynesian, you know, from Cambodia, Philippines, etc.  So when you make a song like that, you're kind of suggesting that Islam is a race, which kind of gives people the wrong idea, because it's not.  So my other question is, how many, what is the percentage of white people in America?  Primary opposition.  What about, what about Islam?  How many, what percentage... If you don't want me to show my sign, I don't have to.  Do you know what percentage of Americans are Muslim?  No, I do not.  I'm just wondering because that could be a valid point.  Or maybe it's not, depending on what the percentage actually is. ",

And boy, were those clueless clods mad about Trump.  I was gonna ask the girl if she knew what the murder rates were for Muslims, as opposed to non-Muslims, since Islam is not a race, but she felt stupid and didn't want to talk.  I want to show you something else that happened that day, but warning, it's about to get loud.  This little Antifa screamed at me through a little megaphone, so it's about to get loud in a few seconds. ",

Antifa attacks children, handicapped people, gay people, immigrants, Bernie supporters, and anybody who just happens to be where they are.  I urge you to look at that online.  Antifa is actually... I'm requesting five feet of space from my body right now.  This person is harassing me at this time, and I'm requesting space from this person.  Antifa attacks innocent people.  Antifa is sabotaging our movement.  Antifa is anti-left-wing, anti-liberal, and they spray paint things like liberals get the bullet too.  Well, she has her face covered, so.  The police do, of course, That's harassment.  You just assaulted me, asshole.  I have it on film. ",
