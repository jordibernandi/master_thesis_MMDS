Sometimes the stupid is so strong I can taste it through the monitor.  I'm watching a flirfs video on.  And this flirf has left a taste in my mouth that will not go away.  Today on episode 16 of flirfs are idiots I'm taking a look at someone who personifies the top left of the Dunning-Kruger chart.  This flerf thinks the atmosphere has a pressure gradient because there isn't a magic tree stretching all the way to the dome and says that angels came down and made babies with humans and those babies became giants.  and um... And this, this is the Giants.  Only watch this if you are sure you have facepalm protection, because frankly, I'm fed up of getting angry letters and emails about people getting black eyes.  Guys, I've done it.  I have found the biggest idiot on YouTube, and his name is Why You Are an Idiot. ",

If there was a zombie apocalypse, you idiots would be the only survivors.  And then the zombies would starve to death.  Okay, today we're going to look at... What is it, Mr Riley?  You've got a sick note for the week starting the 20th of May?  Is that the same week that Fight the Flat Earth is doing Sleeping Warrior Week?  No, you will come in and watch every video he puts out.  Also, I need you to do me a favour.  Mr Oakley is missing again.  When you see him, ask him what diffraction is.  Okay, today we're going to explain why, when you look at things, sometimes they look like other things.  This is called pareidolia.  Pareidolia is the tendency to interpret a vague stimulus as something known to the observer, such as seeing shapes in clouds, seeing faces in inanimate objects or abstract patterns, or hearing hidden messages in music.  Rocks may come to mimic recognizable forms through the random processes of formation, weathering, and erosion.  Okay, everyone got that?  Yes, Mr.  Riley?  No, for fuck's sake, there is no independent variable in pareidolia.  Get out and stay out until the 20th.  Oh, good, home time.  I need alcohol.  So, why you are an idiot thinks we live in a dome with waters above and... god above the dome or whatever.  now the dome thing is an issue because unless gravity is real which you say it's not then inside the dome would have an equal pressure everywhere which we know isn't reality as we have a pressure gradient from 14.7 psi at sea level to practically zero psi as you get higher in altitude.  let's listen to.

And you can look at the animals.  If you look at the animals of the past and you look at the animals of today, they're twice as big.  They're twice as big in the past.  They are twice the size in the past.  That requires way more air pressure.  And since you just feel so high, there should be no pressure gradient.  You remove it, there is a pressure gradient. ",

He says the giant tree would have pumped out enough atmosphere to make it so that there wasn't a pressure gradient.  And since the giants cut Yishimil down, that's why there is a pressure gradient now.  Please, please don't think too hard about it.  Your brain will explode.  He doesn't understand that there has to be a force pulling down on the atmosphere to create a gradient now.  And do we know what that force is? ",
