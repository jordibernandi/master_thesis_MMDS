            "text": "I found that with anything, if you push hard enough in one direction, you'll get a significant pushback just because the things that you're saying are usually not going to be all inclusive.  There is going to be something that is left out of your worldview.  And so when you shove in a particular direction, the thing that you've left out ends up drawing strength in the other direction because you are specifically leaving it out of what you're trying to achieve.  Which is, I think, one of the reasons why younger people are probably less tolerant than expected.  So there's been a survey that USA Today are reporting on here that they find alarming, which... I'm not surprised with at all.  Young people are growing less tolerant of LGBTQ individuals, a jarring term for a generation traditionally considered embracing an open as several East Monday shows.  The number of Americans 18 to 34 who are comfortable interacting with LGBTQ people slipped from 53% in 2017 to 45% in 2018. the only age group to show a decline, according to the annual Accelerating Acceptance Report, and that's down from 63% in 2016.  That's very interesting, isn't it?  The more SJWE things get, the less accepting of gay people people become.  I wonder if that's anything to do with the rampant degeneracy of pride parades.  I just have to, I really have to question, you know, how much awful stuff in these pride parades, like really unwholesome stuff, do we have to see before people start thinking, you know what, this isn't actually the future I was looking for.  And it turns out that we may have reached that point.  driving the dilution of acceptance are young women.  Now this is very interesting, isn't it?  Whose overall comfort levels plunged from 64% in 2017 to 52% in 2018.  Very interesting.  It's almost like, No, I'm not even going to go there.  I can't prove it, but it sounds like it might be true, and I'm not going to say it.  Anyway, we count on the narrative that young people are the most progressive and tolerant.  You can guess in the comments what I was thinking.  These numbers, you'll never get it either.  That's the funny thing.  These numbers are very alarming and signal a looming social crisis and discrimination.  Uh-huh.  All right, yeah.  A looming social crisis and discrimination.  Yep.  I'm sure that the future is looking terrible for gay people.  That's what you're saying.  Even though, I mean, every fucking company I can think of currently has the pride flag as their logo.  There are like city halls all across the country putting up pride flags.  It's just everyone, police cars.  It's everywhere at the moment.  It's like, yeah, okay, great.  Everyone's in favor of gay rights, dude.  Like that's, yeah, I agree.  Like, okay, what conversation do we need to have now?  Nothing of any particular note, but you're going on anyway because it's not now about the cause.  The cause has been successful, wildly successful.  Everyone agrees.  Now it's about the institution of it, isn't it?  It's about the LGBTQ as an institution of its own, regardless of the constituent parts of that.  Anyway.  Among the findings, 36% of young people said they were uncomfortable learning a family member was LGBTQ compared with 29% in 2017.  I wonder if that's because they're like, shit, he's going to be a massive SJW.  He's going to say, oh, my oppression.  I don't care.  Don't care about your oppression.  You're not oppressed.  We're all fine.  to that degree.  34% were uncomfortable learning their doctor was gay or LGBTQ compared to 27% earlier.  39% were uncomfortable learning their child had a school lesson on LGBTQ history versus 30% in 2017.  Again, why do you differentiate?  If gay people are part of our civilization, and they are, Why would you have LGBTQ history?  Why would you not, you know, have Alan Turing, a gay man who was persecuted even though he helped Britain defeat the Nazis?  You would just have that as part of what happened when you were explaining that person's life, or Oscar Wilde or something like that.  You don't need separate history because it is part of our history.  I don't know why that has to be said, frankly.  But the negative shift for the young is surprising, said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD president and CEO.  When GLAAD delved into the numbers, the group found the younger generation was coming in contact with more LGBTQ people, particularly individuals who are non-binary or don't simply identify as lesbian or gay.  That's really interesting, isn't it?  the more experience they have coming into contact with these crazy LGBTQ SJW fruitcakes, the more they're like, you know what?  I just don't think so.  I'm actually finding myself less tolerant of whatever it is they're suggesting at this point.  Which is not a good thing, but I tell you what, it's all down to the way that they're acting, you know, I swear to God.  But this newness they're experiencing could be leading to this erosion.  No, it's the constant experience of being told they're a bad person because they're a cis straight person, alright?  That's what it is.  It's a newness that takes time for people to understand.  Our job is to educate about nonconformity.  Now, they're sick of hearing it.  They're sick of hearing.  all they have to do is be tolerant, and now they're tolerant.  And then you're like, okay, but that's not enough.  We need acceptance.  Oh, well, hang on a second.  If we're now talking about, like, naked gay dudes... Dry humping down the street in a pride parade.  I don't see why I should have to accept that.  You know, why don't you turn out in a suit was all I'm saying.  if you want to have a pride parade great Why not people in suits and ties?  Or just t-shirts and jeans walking down the street waving the price.  I'd probably join.  I'm like, yeah.  Yeah good for you guys, you know, but when it's guys in thongs with ball gags on leashes and And people like wearing dildo outfits and things like this, man, there's something about it that just says gone too far.  You know, you've lost me.  You've lost me on this.  I think this is going too far.  I'm becoming less tolerant of that.  And this is important because the survey results come during pride 2019 and on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which sparked the LGBTQ rights movement.  Yeah.  50 years ago.  So 11 years before I was born.  Okay.  And now it's absolutely everywhere.  A casual observer from the 50s would probably say something like, the gays have taken over.  And they are marching down the street in a degenerate fashion.  Why are you doing this?  And I would have to say, you know what?  I don't know.  I actually don't know why we're doing this.  I don't see the need for this at all.  But look at this.  They also landed a dark hour politically and culturally for the LGBTQ community.  You fucking mental.  There are cop cars painting the fight.  The cops paint the pride flag on their faces, waving the private.  What the fuck are you talking about?  A dark hour. ",
