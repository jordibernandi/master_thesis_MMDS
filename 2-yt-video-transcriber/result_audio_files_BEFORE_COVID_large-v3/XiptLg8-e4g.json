            "text": "Alright, welcome back to Bible Answers.  Today I'm going to be answering an email that I got in regards to a question regarding a comment that Reformed Calvinist Dr.  James White made and also of what a hebrew scholar uh dr michael heiser made.  um two separate two separate questions but they wanted to get my thoughts on it and i usually don't like to comment just on myself.  um i usually will show sources or back it up with sources.  that's just not my my opinion my thought you know or even my commentary so to speak that i'm just saying this for my own.  uh but i usually will support everything i say with other sources other scholars who I think have a lot more to say than I do in regards to the subject, who are in the field studying these topics and these issues.  So the first thing, I'm going to show you two video clips because I don't want this taking out of context.  I have two short video clips.  They're only probably less than a minute long of the comments from the questions being made.  So I don't want any confusion that I'm misquoting them.  I'm not misrepresenting them.  So with that, the first one has to deal with James White apparently not knowing Hebrew, though he has made a comment to other people on his videos, like when he, I think when he was just having a discussion with this pastor, Stephen Anderson, who was a King James only, he mentioned to him that he reads from the Hebrew and the Greek when it comes to the Old and New Testament.  But then he goes on to another teaching video.  He talks about John 1.1.  He's referencing the Greek and all that good stuff.  But then when he gets to the Old Testament of Exodus 3.14, he apparently doesn't even know what God said to Moses regarding the one who is sending Moses regarding his name or what to say to the people.  He definitely didn't know that basic Exodus 3.14 passage, which is a very basic Hebrew knowledge to anybody who studied Hebrew.  It's just as basic as knowing the Shema.  Shema Israel, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Echad.  or even Genesis 1.1, It's as common as that.  Exodus 3.14, anybody who knows anything about basic biblical Hebrew, who has studied it, knows Exodus 3.14 in the context.  Apparently, Dr.  White didn't.  He did not.  He didn't quote it correctly.  In fact, he used more of a modern Hebrew on it, or a more New Testament modern Hebrew version of it.  And he quotes it.  I'm going to show you the video clip real quick here.  I want you to judge for yourself.  So take a look at the video clip, and we'll discuss it. ",

            "text": "But the Greek is... So if you saw what he said, if you listened actually and saw, actually he was saying... And then he didn't have the Hebrew in front of him.  well, you didn't have the Septuagint in front of you also, but you knew what the Septuagint said apparently, and you didn't have that in front of you.  So to not understand the basic Hebrew in which the Septuagint was based on, which is the Hebrew, the Septuagint is a translation, and he did not even know and understand the basics of a Hebrew, Exodus 3.14 from the Hebrew, but he knew the Septuagint, which tells you that, and should tell you, that most Calvinistic reformers, the majority of them, do not have a working knowledge of the Hebrew language, even a really basic fundamental understanding.  Because something like that is very fundamental to most Hebrew students who study Hebrew.  It's just real basic.  So I'm very surprised that Dr.  White can claim that he reads from the Hebrew and the Greek, but yet he doesn't even know a simple passage as Exodus 3.14.  All right, I need to kind of interrupt for a second here because I did not quote the Hebrew.  I just simply made comments about it.  And I was supposed to, and I kind of overlooked it.  But the Hebrew that James White should have known that's very fundamental to every basic Hebrew student is as follows.  And it says, So that is the fundamental aspect of the passage that should have been known, just like Genesis 1-1 or the Shema of Deuteronomy 6-4.  Again, this is what James White should have known, but yet he did know the Septuagint and didn't have that in front of him.  So he's more grounded in the Greek rather than the Hebrew.  So I had to put that out there because I didn't read it in the video.  So now let's get back to the video.  So that was disturbing because if anybody who really knows the Hebrew studies it, you don't have to be fluent in it, but if you study it enough and you know enough of the fundamentals, just on the concepts and ideas of the words, the ideas, and the culture of the time for the transitions from Genesis on to later prophets, Calvinism, Reform theology falls apart.  They have to rely on the Greek translation to get support for anything that's being taught in Calvinism or in Reformed theology.  And that's a fact because this is why the Calvinist reformers and a lot of Christian scholars in the West, they hold to a Greek New Testament original or a copy from, or going back to, these are copies going back to a Greek original.  They have to hold on to that.  And it's even stronger for the reformer and Calvinist because if the New Testament was not all or completely written in Greek, then we can point out that this doesn't reflect the Jewish mindset of maybe a Hebrew text or Hebrew knowledge, and therefore there might be some inconsistencies in the Greek New Testament, which there are.  Any serious Greek scholar will tell you that no two pages within the New Testament itself are the same.  Zero.  So they're all different.  So with that alone, we know that you're going to have some variance and any textual critic who looks at this seriously.  And I have I mean, my bookshelf was it was full for the first 10, 15 years with textual criticism books of scholars in the field, you know, from Metzger and Robinson and even with Young and.  You know, just a whole host of these books on my shelf regarding different areas of how we should read texts and the different variations that we have.  The different versions of each one going in from the 4th century on, including the fragments.  So I've been in that area.  I'm not too impressed with it.  I think we need to go back to the Hebrew, the original, what Jesus and the prophets or the Jesus and the apostles read from, which was the Torah, the prophets and the writings.  They did not read from a Septuagint.  Now this takes me to my next person, Dr.  Michael Heiser, who assumes in this video clip I'm going to show you that the prophets, or I'm sorry, Jesus and the apostles read and quoted from the Greek Septuagint.  So take a listen to this.  And the psalmist says, Arise, O God, and take back the nations, inherit the nations. ",

            "text": "Well, the Hebrew Old Testament was translated into Greek in ancient times.  Jesus and the apostles, most of the time when they reference the Old Testament, they're actually doing it.  in the ancient Greek translation known as the Septuagint.  It's about 70, 80, 70, 75% of the time.  If you look at Psalm 82. ",

            "text": "So as you can see there, Dr.  Heiser points this out that Jesus and the apostles basically quoted and used the Greek translation for the Hebrew called the Septuagint.  Let me read to you what the scholars in Israel have to say about this.  There's a consensus in Israel regarding what was used at the time.  If you look at the works of Immanuel Tov and others, and the person here, Rabbi Stephen Notley with a PhD from Hebrew University.  I'm going to read some of his comments here.  This is pretty much a consensus regarding that the Jews living within the Judean desert used one Hebrew text called the Proto-Meziric text.  And this is the text the Pharisees, the Rabbinic Pharisees, would have read from.  This would have been read by Jesus and the apostles in the synagogues.  So this is a consensus.  And of course, the language of Jesus and the apostles.  Let me read what he says.  He says, He's betrayed reading and teaching from the Bible, and there are clear indications in these accounts that he used the Hebrew Scriptures.  Now, Manuel 12 will say this is the Proto-Mesoretic text, which we use today as a Leningradian and Lubbock Codex type, but that's what they used.  In this, he was not alone.  We have not a single example of a Jewish teacher of the first century in the land of Israel teaching from any other version of the Scriptures than Hebrew, or the Proto-Mesoretic Hebrew text.  In addition, Jesus is often described as speaking in parables.  They were delivered oral in popular non-scholarly settings.  They were also in Hebrew.  Outside of the gospel story, parables of the type associated with Jesus are to be found only in rabbinic literature, and without exception, they are all in Hebrew.  Not Aramaic, not Greek, no other language.  We have not a single parable in Aramaic, as I just stated, so it seems that according to Jewish custom, one did not tell parables in Aramaic.  To suggest that Jesus told his parables in Aramaic, and I would say also in any other language, including Greek, is to ignore overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  So what do we have here?  And this is pretty much the consensus with most Hebrew scholars in Israel who study this topic and study the literature and the text.  Most Western scholars do not study rabbinic literature.  They don't check what Jesus said in parables and compare them.  They don't gain that access to do so, and it's a shame.  So for what Michael Heisner is saying, to even assume that that's what they use, and I've heard this a lot, and I know Dr.  James White, I believe... He mentioned to a friend of mine who had contacted him that he believed Jesus spoke Aramaic.  But again, that would still put the... the Greek New Testament as a translation when it comes to the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  Because if he spoke Aramaic, which of course he didn't according to all the evidence that he spoke Hebrew, then it's still a translation.  And we must be careful in looking at a translation, specifically a Greek translation, that's considered to the Jews a pagan language.  that was created out of paganism for the pagans.  And we have Hellenistic Jews like Philo and others who used the Septuagint, but Jesus and the apostles did not.  They read from the Proto-Mezerite texts, the Hebrew scriptures of their time, in the temple and the synagogues locally within the Judean desert, and they spoke the Hebrew language.  Jesus spoke to them in Hebrew.  He spoke to Paul in Hebrew, according to Acts.  Paul spoke Hebrew to his brethren.  In fact, the Roman guard was surprised that Paul spoke Greek.  He said, you speak Greek?  Because it wasn't as common as people like to make it.  specifically for Jews in those areas.  So for James White, he needs to brush upon his Hebrew, which is the language of God, which Paul says, God breathed the language of the Hebrew scriptures.  And he says, good for teaching and correcting, rebuking, training men up for righteousness.  not the Septuagint, not the Greek or Latin or any other text.  If you go to the Catholics, there are sacred scriptures in Latin.  You go to the Greeks or Reformers, it's the Greek New Testament.  You go to Israel, to the Jews, it's the Hebrew scriptures, the ones Jesus and the apostles read from.  So again, this is the overwhelming evidence what you saw in these two videos.  Unfortunately, these are outdated sources that need to be kind of brought up to date with what they know and what they study in Israel and these findings that need to be more accessible to them because in our academia here in the West, We aren't told these things.  We are told Greek and Latin, the Septuagint, they quoted most from that, and they spoke Greek and all this stuff.  And yeah, maybe he knew some Aramaic and maybe Hebrew, but this was, you know, it's all nonsense.  Yeah, did Jesus know other languages?  Sure, he probably did know Aramaic or Latin or Greek, but his mother tongue language that he spoke to the Pharisees, the leaders, the apostles, all that was Hebrew.  Nothing else.  We know Paul spoke Greek.  We know that.  But his mother tongue was Hebrew.  So again, This stuff needs to be updated.  It needs to be corrected.  And I see a lot of scholars making this error.  And this is not my opinion.  I'm not... Yes, I'm an associate scholar with a master's certification, associate scholar in linguistic context of the Bible, studied Hebrew, Aramaic, and the Greek and all that through Hebrew University.  So yes, I have asked these questions.  These are the answers.  And this is a consensus.  And again... But I was also educated here in the West where I know both sides of the coin.  And I'm sorry, but here we are completely outdated and we're using outdated sources and all that.  I hope this helps with that question that I got regarding both comments.  And I hope that gets corrected and it gets updated.  But I seriously doubt it.  I mean, if you hold to a specific theology or doctrine and you have a certain text that supports it or you think it supports it, then you're going to continue to use it.  So again, my name is Dr.  Al Garza.  This is Bible Answers.  And I hope to see you again soon.  And thank you and God bless. ",
