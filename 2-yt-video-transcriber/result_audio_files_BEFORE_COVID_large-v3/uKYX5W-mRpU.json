            "text": "Hello, and welcome to Jack Van Impe Presents.  My, once again, there is so much that we want to share with you today.  And every time I pick up the newspaper, I'm enlightened by what this world has to say about certain situations.  I'm sorry to say that fears are really intensifying right now that... The terrible job that we are having right now with Iran is something we've never had before.  In fact, it's sort of a standoff between Iran and America, and it's spiraling right out of control.  Take a look.  Iran hits out against the United States and its allies.  My oh my.  And the European Union urges Iran to back down from nuclear escalation.  The foreign ministers of France and Germany and the UK are really concerned about what is happening there in Iran.  Iran quadruples uranium enrichment.  We don't care what you have to say.  We're going to do what we want.  even if the European Union and the United States try to keep us from it.  Iran warns U.S.  Navy of secret new weapon to send warships to the bottom of the sea.  Oh, my.  Can you believe it?  And then U.S.  official.  Iranian missiles spotted in the Persian Gulf.  Well, I remember that back in May.  And here we are.  Tougher sanctions bring U.S.-Iran showdown.  And you know there is going to be a showdown.  We'll talk about that a little bit later.  Britain warns Iran, don't underestimate the United States.  Oh, my, oh, my.  That was a British foreign secretary.  U.S.-Iran say not seeking war as tensions spike.  Well, our president said that.  We don't want war, but are we ready?  Iran accuses U.S.  of an unacceptable escalation in tensions.  Going back and forth here.  Do you see it?  Back and forth.  Iran says no plans for a Rouhani-Trump meeting on U.N.  side.  Well, they went to the General Assembly, remember?  And they said, we're not going to talk to each other while we're there.  I'm not even going to say hello.  Well, they didn't.  But our president still says this, Trump on Iran, we don't want war.  Wow, that's important.  Yes, but U.S.  is prepared after attack on Saudi oil.  They want diplomacy, but it's almost impossible with Iran.  And also Saudi Arabia goes on and says it seeks to avert war, but the ball is in Iran's court.  Well, you know why.  Take a look at this next headline.  Iran dismisses U.S.  claim it was behind Saudi oil strikes and says ready for war.  Well, the one says we don't want war, and the next says we're ready for war.  Iran president says U.S.  leader of world terrorism.  Can you believe it?  He says our president is that.  Here's a very good question.  Is it too late to counter China's rise?  The Pentagon seeks drone-fired lasers to destroy nuclear-armed missiles.  You know, friends, there's so much to consider out there.  And I am grateful that we have a president who says we are not going to be number two.  We are going to stand up to what's happening.  Now, Jack, let me just say this.  Russia, China, is there going to be a war? ",

            "text": "No.  The Bible says in Ezekiel 38-39, Gog, Magog, Meshach, Tubal, and Rosh are going to lead the battle.  Who are they?  Well, Gog is the leader.  Meshach and Tubal is Moscow and Tobolsk after being interpreted.  And all the Orient, Revelation says, is going with them.  China, North Korea, all of them.  Then there's going to be Gomer, Germany.  tagarmah turkey iran all of them.  it's going to be the bloodiest war in the world.  the blood will flow to the bridles of the horses for two hundred miles.  when it's over it'll take seven months just to bury the deceased bodies and most of them are going to be muslim terrorists.  you can thank this president that he's trying to have this.  that keeps illegal people out of here, terrorists who want to kill Americans.  Right now, the same terrorist crowd has 50 different places where they're going to move in the world to kill every Christian there is.  We are in trouble.  Thank you, President Trump.  You want to protect all of us.  And dear Caldeans, you're saying, please pray that he gets in again.  NOW, WILL IT BE BLOODY?  HERE IS THE ATOMIC WAR OF HISTORY, PSALM 97 3, ISAIAH 66 15, EZEKIEL 20 47, JEWEL CHAPTER 2, VERSES 3 AND 30, ZEPHANIAH CHAPTER 1, VERSE 18, MALACHI 4 1, REVELATION 8 7, A THIRD PART OF THE TREES WAS BURNED, ALL GREEN GRASS WAS BURNED, THE GREATEST ATOMIC WAR IN HISTORY.  Nothing like it's ever happened.  And nothing again will ever happen because the Lord Jesus comes right at the close of the final battle.  Armageddon says it's over.  And he says from now on, none of you have to worry about the second death, eternal life. ",

            "text": "Amen.  Jack mentioned just a few moments ago about the war that will be coming with Russia and China as buddies, and they're going to be coming down on Israel.  Well, the American standard right now is standing with Israel.  That's pretty common.  I'm hearing that from many, many people.  America seems to love Israel.  America seems to love Netanyahu, what's going on over there.  Well, you know, I want to ask Jack a very, very important question.  As we join with the Hebrew people and with the Jews, and as Russia comes down from the north with China, who will win?  Who is going to really come out blasting, so to speak?  Jack, who's going to win that war over there? ",

            "text": "Well, let me say this also.  Pence is the vice president for President Trump.  He spoke at the Knesset in Jerusalem.  And they said, when he got through, the applause was the greatest ever.  Standing ovation.  They could hardly quiet the people.  He spoke to their hearts.  And he probably told them that Trump is standing for Israel.  And he is.  And you see, the Bible teaches Israel is going to fight this communist terrorist group.  Israel has the blessing of God on them, and they're going to win.  There's no doubt about it.  It's going to be a bloody war.  A river of blood 200 miles long to the bridle of the horses.  All these months to bury the dead.  And you list what?  Jesus calls us for the rapture.  And it's just before the war begins.  And he says, I'm going to keep you out of testing that comes up on the whole earth.  We go up in the twinkling of an eye.  We're there for seven years.  The war lasts seven years.  The last battle is Armageddon.  And he comes back and sets the peace up.  And he says, from now on, none of you need to worry.  I kept you alive and safe in the first one.  And now we're in the second one.  On you, the second death has no power.  Amen. ",

I went to college and got 16 doctorates.  I fell in love with Jesus.  Oh, how he suffered on that cross.  Blood flowing from the face as they battered it, from the nails where they pierced his hands and feet, from the Roman cat in the 90s that ripped that body open.  And he did it for me.  so you could live forever, eternal life.  Father, I want what you did for me, Jesus.  I've had a hardened heart for too long.  Today, I receive what you're offering me.  Jesus, I receive you now into my heart.  Come in.  Thank you for dying for my sin. ",
