            "text": "Without any power, you can't buy food.  You can't get fuel for a generator.  Hospitals are struggling to keep on working.  My family, as most Venezuelan families, is quite big, so I've got quite a big spread of people in different parts of the country.  They never thought it would come to this.  This is like the walking dead.  This is like living in the apocalypse.  A lot of my family are asking me in London what's going on in the country.  They all don't think we know how deep of a problem it still is because some regions are virtually out of reach.  Desperation is growing in Venezuela as that blackout is entering its sixth day.  Electricity is coming on in some parts of the country, but the death toll has risen now to 24.  People had to basically drink water out of polluted rivers or sewage drains.  You can see the images there.  This is happening in Caracas and elsewhere in the country.  Also, widespread looting has erupted in several cities.  Now, Venezuela's socialist dictator, Nicolas Maduro, first tried to claim that the U.S.  sabotaged the power grid with a cyber attack.  We've got Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying last night that the U.S.  is withdrawing all remaining U.S.  diplomats and their personnel from Venezuela.  The Venezuelan capital Caracas and many other parts of the country have been hit by another power outage weeks after widespread blackouts.  The metro in Caracas has closed temporarily, leaving thousands of commuters crowding the streets.  Well, the information minister said the main hydroelectric dam had been the subject of an attack.  Earlier this month, most Venezuelans went without electricity for almost a week.  You have to stop for 5 seconds.  Where is Job?  I came from Valencia to heal myself.  They couldn't heal me because of the same problem of the light.  Because of the fear that if the light went out, the machine would burn and I would die.  But hackers could launch a similar attack in the US.  We can't just look at the Ukraine attack and go, oh, we're safe against that attack, even if we just lose a portion, right?  If we have New York City or Washington, D.C.  go down for a day, two days, a week, how does life look like at that point?  Rob Lee is a former cyber warfare operations officer in the US military and investigated the Ukraine attack.  He told us some US electric utilities have weaker security than Ukraine.  And the malicious software the hackers used has already been detected in the US.  It's very concerning that these same actors using similar capabilities and tradecraft are preparing and are getting access to these business networks and getting access to portions of the power grid.  In Ukraine, they restarted the power in just hours.  But an attack in the U.S.  could leave people without electricity for days or even weeks, according to experts, because ironically, Scott, America's advanced automated grid would be much harder to fix.  One way to get at America, and an easy way quite frankly, is through an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack.  Consider, every major city in America, how does it get its water supply?  Consider that every major city in America, its average food supply on hand is 21 to 28 days.  Consider, where do we get our medication?  Consider, what happens in nursing homes and hospitals?  What happens to our transportation grid?  Anything driven that, well, most of them have computers in them.  They're all gone.  What would you do in the case of an EMP?  Electromagnetic pulse.  A burst of radiation that knocks out every electrical system in the country.  Impending doom.  What you reading, Dad?  Honey, everything's fine.  There's nothing to worry about.  When things go south, the sheeple will clean out every supermarket in town.  Typical sheeple.  Today I'm convening this meeting to follow through on my promise to secure crucial infrastructure and the networks that we've been talking so much about over the last period of time of the federal government against cyber threats.  I will hold my cabinet secretaries and agency heads accountable totally accountable for the cybersecurity of their organization, of which we probably don't have as much, certainly not as much as we should have.  We must defend and protect federal networks and data.  We operate these networks on behalf of the American people, and they are very important and very sacred.  We will empower these agencies to modernize their IT systems for better security and other reasons.  We will protect our critical infrastructure, such as power plants and electrical grids.  The electrical grid problem is a problem, but we'll have it solved relatively soon.  Alexa, hot tub?  That sucked.  Alexa, play music.  Okay.  And then there was the incident.  Wait, that was you guys?  I don't know, was it?  Powering down.  Powering up.  Powering down.  She says she's doing it, but I don't see anything to you.  Holy... Keep these stones in many places.  This is the room where my parents taught me for the first time.  Why do you learn this language if you don't use it?  It's a tradition we hand down.  It meant something once.  Must be here for a reason.  One generation passeth away and another cometh, but the earth abideth forever.  Why have you come here?  Why have you traveled through time?  I have a question answered.  A question?  Yes, why can't I change the past?  Why would you want to?  You've lost someone.  Someone you loved very much.  Thank you.  So the headlines have not been good for the U.S.  president this weekend.  In the past few hours, Donald Trump has responded to two reports containing explosive accusations against him.  The latest is this one from The Washington Post.  It says there are no detailed records from any of the five meetings Mr.  Trump has had with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The Post says Trump went to extraordinary lengths to keep the specifics of those conversations secret, including, on at least one occasion, confiscating the notes from the only person who'd been in the room with him.  That's his interpreter.  And not allowing the interpreter to discuss the meetings with anyone else in the administration.  I'm not keeping anything under wraps.  I couldn't care less.  The world's defense analyst, Obai Shabandar, joins us now in the studio.  Obai, now, the Trump administration announced back on December 19th that Daesh was pretty much defeated, and they announced at that time that they were going to withdraw the 2,000 troops.  Now they're saying they're keeping 200 peacekeepers there.  What's this all about?  Well, it's an interesting shift here of the Trump administration's narrative.  And it seems that Senator Lindsey Graham, who has been lobbying President Trump on this plan, seems to have gotten his way.  Just a week ago during the Munich Security Conference, Lindsey Graham was meeting with the US acting Secretary of Defense, Pat Shanahan, trying to tell him that if you maintain a residual force of 200 US troops on the ground, that the other European countries, UK and France, that are on the ground with military forces in Syria will also remain.  They seem to have gotten their way.  Now, the big question is, What can this 200 forces, 200 people do?  And breaking tonight, more troubling news in our own hemisphere.  Two Russian jets touching down in Venezuela this weekend, reportedly carrying dozens of Russian troops, along with a Russian defense official.  National Security Advisor John Bolton tonight slamming Russia in a tweet saying, quote, The United States sends food and medicine to help the people of Venezuela rather than sending nuclear-capable bombers and special forces to prop up a corrupt dictator.  Russia should work with the international community to support the Venezuelan people.  Here with me now is former U.S.  Army Special Forces and Center for Security Policy Executive Vice President Jim Hansen.  Good to see you, Jim.  So how far do you think Russia is willing to go to protect Maduro?  By sending these troops, they have made a significant provocation and raised the stakes significantly.  I mean, at this point, the U.S.  has already recognized Juan Guaido as the rightful leader of Venezuela.  So Russia coming in now and going against the will, as was mentioned, of 60 countries that support Guaido is a bad thing.  And we should keep in mind, this is not the only place that U.S.  and Russian troops could potentially be on the ground together.  In Syria, they are.  Right.  And there was a group of 200 Russian mercenaries that decided to try and take a U.S.  base out in Syria.  It didn't work out too well.  No, they got returned to their component molecules.  So I think Putin should keep that in mind.  Today, it's my great honor to sign the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act into law.  Everyday America's adversaries are testing our cyber defenses.  They attempt to gain access to our critical infrastructure, exploit our great companies, and undermine our entire way of life.  And we can't let that happen.  Let me begin by saying that, once again, full faith and support for America's intelligence agencies.  I have a full faith in our intelligence agencies.  Whoops, they just turned off the light.  That must be the intelligence agencies.  There it goes.  Okay.  You guys okay?  That was strange, but that's okay. ",
