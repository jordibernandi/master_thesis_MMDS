Milo, right before the break, I mentioned a book I have coming out in August called Jezebel's War with America.  And I kind of connect the dots and say, hey, look, she was a woman who lived in the past 3,000 years ago.  Jesus references a woman, a false prophetess in the New Testament called Jezebel, probably just the name he gives her.  And I said, look, the same demonic forces that operated through her are operating again today, connect the dots from the rise of witchcraft to radical feminism, to the emasculating of men and maleness, to the silencing of the prophetic voices.  And on and on.  In ancient idolatry, baby killing was common, sacrificing a baby.  You've got the militant abortion spirit.  Not a 15-year-old girl who's raped and is struggling and fearful, do I have an abortion or not?  But we're talking about the shout your abortion, militant, celebrate this, pro-infanticide crowd, etc.  So I connect the dots and say, there's demonic junk going on.  It's not just earthly and natural.  You wanted to weigh in on that. ",

            "text": "I'm so glad that you are writing that book because I have something similar related.  Perhaps there'll be quite complimentary to one another.  Um, I'm currently assembling my thoughts on feminism, which does contain basically everything boils down to abortion.  It all boils down to this, in this great invention of Christianity in the middle ages of the individual worth of the human being of equality before God, which leads us into equality before the law of the idea that we are, you know, beings created in God's image and, um, And we're all of unique moral worth and understanding that and why.  it's therefore impossible to support abortion.  It's impossible to support the death penalty as much as we might want it for some people.  This is a base.  This is the basic, you know, societal innovation of Christianity all throughout the West and where they don't have Christianity.  Of course, you know, women are still oppressed.  You know, other people are thrown off roofs and people shoot each other over minor disagreements.  all boils down to this is why all boils down to abortion.  That's why abortion is the central most important issue politically in the US, because it's the most important issue for humanity, the most important issue there is.  Do human beings have intrinsic moral worth or not?  And the left doesn't believe that they do.  The left does not believe that people have intrinsic moral worth, mainly because so many of them don't feel that way about themselves.  This social justice war is psychology.  Damaged individuals with incredibly low self-esteem who, you know, generalize from the particular and invent this entire political system based on their own, you know, in some cases quite justified self-loathing.  Um, so my next book is about feminism, but what after that, uh, is going to be about why women are so unhappy.  And it focuses on witchcraft.  You know, you of course will know that 1.3, 1.4 million Americans now describe themselves as Wiccans.  That's more than there are Presbyterians.  This is a sign of women who've given up on God, given up on the family, and given up on motherhood.  You know, given up on the prospect.  I just saw a tweet today from a dreadful woman who writes, I think, for the Daily Beast.  Her name is Taylor Lorenz.  She's the one who was responsible for doxing Pamela Geller's children and putting them in the crosshairs of the jihadists.  And she's tweeting today about, oh, why don't shows like The Bachelor have women of over 30 or over 40 looking for love?  And I'm like, hmm, regret setting in, isn't it, Pumpkin?  These are women who have chosen to forswear love, babies, husband, marriage, the home, all of the things that make women happy.  Instead, for this kind of nebulous, empty nothing of a media career in New York, guaranteeing that they're going to be miserable, and that they're gonna.  they're gonna die, you know, unfulfilled, and unable to realize their potential.  And so I'm seeing this happen everywhere.  And the rise of witchcraft is really just a so a symbol of this.  yeah it is.  i'm so glad you're writing this.  i can't wait to read your book because i think yours is going to come out before mine does so i'm sure i'll lean on it heavily.

But in any case... with Mayor Pete, remarkably, as he was attacking Mike Pence's Christianity and Donald Trump's Christianity.  Okay, I understand how he could attack Donald Trump's Christianity and how Christian is he, etc.  Is he a work in progress?  But he refused to make a statement about late-term abortion, but then pointed to one of his favorite verses in Scripture, Matthew 25, when Jesus talks about caring for the least of these, which then applies to illegal immigrants.  It's like, hang on, you have you have a heart for illegal immigrants, some of whom are some of whom are criminals and shouldn't be here.  And Mexico doesn't want either.  You have a heart for them, but you won't even make a statement about late term abortion.  And you have right now I live in North Carolina.  The governor of North Carolina refused to sign a bill that if a baby is born alive, that it gets medical care.  Well, that's already on the book.  Well, then sign it.  So the culture of death that we have, when Mother Teresa years ago made the comment that when women kill their own children in the womb, how much lower can you get than that?  When it's celebrated, it's a whole other issue.  So yeah, the radical feminism, which then wants to make men into women and women into men, includes the war on gender.  the seductive spirit of Jezebel, so pornography, which also destroys humanity and makes women just into sex objects and makes men degradable in their own eyes, on and on and on.  These things are certainly interconnected.  And where it goes, it goes the way of death.  It doesn't reproduce, it doesn't bring life, it doesn't enhance another generation.  And once again, a recent survey repeated the results of previous surveys that religious married women were the happiest of all with their sex lives.  and in general, this has happened for decades.  No surprise. ",

            "text": "Well, it's true.  Also, of course, every survey that comes out shows that, uh, Republicans and Republicans or right-leaning people in general, uh, massively better looking.  They're much more physically attractive because they, and it is not as frivolous, frivolous or as flippant as it sounds.  It's because those of us who have an appreciation, understanding for reverence for, um, institution for religion, for, for the family, understand also the importance of beauty and truth and joy and these central Christian virtues that have made the West a nice place to live.  And we have a, you know, we know that there are objective beauty standards for men, just like there are for women and that they change a little over time, but not that dramatically, you know, sort of, sort of, okay.  Yes.  The ideal, uh, womanly shape has grown and shrunk you know, generally oscillated over time in the West, but it's never been Lena Dunham.  And it's this loss of appreciation for beauty and truth and joy, these central Christian virtues that is part of the problem, the uglification of the world.  And that's what my next, my feminism as Cancerbrook is going to be about.  You know, Chesterton would uh, Cheterton orthodoxy says that suicide is the greatest kind of crime anyone can commit because, you know, it's not like killing one person.  You're effectively killing the world.  You know, you're, you're, you're, you're unmaking your entire world.  It's like you're murdering the whole universe by killing yourself.  Um, I don't know if he's quite right about that.  I think abortion might be a step further because you're, you're, you're killing a part of you that hasn't, hasn't the wherewithal, the ability to fight back.  It's a sort of self abnegation of, of even even worse kind because of the, because of the, the, the, murdered potential of that life that is part of you.  It seems to me that in the abstract, it's a nice theological point about suicide, about it being the greatest crime because you're sort of killing the world.  But in real moral terms, actually, you are murdering your own potential and future. ",

And people I think who have phenomenally low self-esteem, who see no value in themselves, see perhaps no value in their own legacy, in their own future, in their own potential, and therefore, you know, and also, of course, don't really see, they don't, because there's this extraordinary strain of sociopathy on the left, I think, and it's a natural consequence of, you know, not having, not having faith, not having respect for the family and not having, you know, a true, proper love for other people, which can only come from the realization that other people are made in the image of God, have individual worth, right?  If you don't believe that, I guess it's quite easy to just, you know, have the, to fool yourself into the clump of cells thing and just say, yes, doctor, suck it out.  Excuse the phrase, but that's what they're doing.  You know, sell the parts off for scrap.  This kind of sociopathic, you know, like jaw-droppingly horrendous attitude to life is the natural consequence of not treating other human beings as people with intrinsic worth and value.  And you can see that woman that I mentioned earlier, Taylor Lorenz, who's now kind of regretting her life choices, the ease with which, and even the glibness and worse than that, the gloating after she'd outed Pamela Geller's daughters, you know, said, oh, you know, these women that are famous on Instagram, did you know?  their mother is, you know, Islamophobic, crazy Pamela Geller?  You know, trying to, you know, trying to get these kids in trouble, trying to get them fired, trying in the most unspeakably awful way to drive a wedge between mother and mother and daughters.  And she must have done enough research to know that the kid's dad is dead.  Right.  So she's been bringing these.  Pamela has been bringing her children up alone.  They are incredibly close and tight, but they have always been scrupulous about not identifying, you know, one another in public to keep everybody safe.  And the sort of gloating with which Taylor Lorenz is sort of like carving up families, you know, bragging about having out of this because because somebody has a slightly different ideological opinion about whatever.  This is this is the mind of somebody who kills children, who stays unmarried, who suddenly wakes up one day at the age of 35 and says, oh, my goodness, what have I done?  You know, what have I done with my life?  Well, You asked for this.  You brought this on yourself.  So I don't shed tears for people like that, although I believe that there's, of course, redemption available for everybody.  I don't shed tears for her wasted life and opportunity because she had every available chance to \u2013 she had every \u2013 I mean, this is a rich girl from Connecticut.  She had every bit of data in front of her.  She had all the resources possible to make the right choice, and she consistently \u2013 studiously and deliberately made the wrong choice. ",
