            "text": "The Opel Tower builders used low-strength concrete.  Let's have a look.  Hello everyone and welcome to this episode of Heiser Says.  I thought I'd quickly share this article with you that's just come out from ABC.  The final report has now been published, the independent report, and it looks like the builders were using low-strength concrete.  and the beams burst under pressure.  so let's read through this.  parts of the opal tower were constructed using low strength concrete with under designed critical support beams bursting under extreme pressure.  an investigation found in the apartment complex key points.  an eight-week investigation found several major construction issues at the opal tower building in sydney's west.  the report was written by three of new south wales most senior engineers.  The damage to the building has triggered widespread questions on the quality of large-scale apartment development in Australia.  I've read through the interim report and I'll link to that as a card in this video.  Later I will go through the final report in detail.  But judging by what we've seen in the Shergold Weir report, they're just systematic issues in our construction industry.  And I'm trying to think, I'm thinking, how can I make a five-point tips for someone buying an apartment and what to look out for?  But the problem is all the pieces of paper you get are meaningless if they're just ignored.  It's that simple.  If they ignore the design and do whatever the hell they want, you can't really tell until you investigate.  Right.  So back to the report.  The Opal Tower final report made public today after a near two-month investigation outlines numerous key construction and material deficiencies in the 36-storey apartment complex that was evacuated on Christmas Eve after residents heard a loud cracking noise.  The ABC understands 259 units in the 392-unit apartment complex at Sydney's Olympic Park are today still empty with hundreds of families still based in temporary accommodation.  Some residents have vowed to never return to the apartment, some of which were originally valued at more than $2 million.  The report, written by three of the state's most senior engineers and triggered by the state government in the days after the cracks emerged, found changes made after the original Opeltower design were exacerbated by construction issues.  So, just dwelling on that, changes made after the original design.  So, I've done another video where the architect months ago was talking about all the design features.  So, just think about that.  You, as an architect, you spend all this time designing and then changes are made at the last minute.  Maybe because of the way the building's procured.  Maybe it's designed and constructed and you don't have that authority.  Maybe the builder says, oh, I've got this new concrete I can use that's cheaper.  Maybe the real estate person selling it in the display room combines several apartments together and changes the floor load to make more money.  Maybe.  However, it stopped short of, back to the report, however, it stopped short of pinning responsibility on the builder icon, which is backed by multi-billion dollar Japanese firm Kajima Corporation or the engineers WSP, one of the world's biggest firms.  Well, I wonder who will be responsible.  It also did not name ECOV, the Australian-based developer of the multi-million dollar project or any of the subcontractors involved.  We have not sought to indicate who was responsible for any of the causes, but rather to establish their structural basis.  It said, well, I can appreciate that.  That's their engineers.  It's not really their job to establish responsibility.  I think that has to be a more thorough investigation and that will be determined by the courts.  The report, which comes after an interim report was released last month, looked at security footage of the original incident on Level 10 of the building at 2.16pm on Christmas Eve, which showed the cracks first appearing and lasting for eight seconds.  The authors toured the site on multiple occasions, spoke to residents, and reviewed the design and construction records.  They also held discussions with WSP, Icon, and floor slab designer ASP.  The report criticized some of the technical information provided by those companies, We have noted that at times documentation has been unclear, the report said.  During the investigation, the authors said they found damage on 10 levels of the 36th level building, as well as damage in the basement level.  Three major causes are highlighted.  The report found the hob beams, a beam that sits on the edge of a slab of a concrete or pier, were underdesigned at several locations of the building.  Underdesigned.  Wow, that's concerning.  A decision to grout only partially a section between the hob beams and the panel significantly raised the level of stress in the building.  I wonder if that was a decision or if that was an effort.  Construction and material deficiencies such as low strength concrete were used in level 4A of the building.  The ABC contacted Icon, the builder, and the developer Eco for comment.  At the time of publications, both parties had not received a copy of the report and declined to comment on its contents.  A spokesman for ICON said 171 units reviewed by Cardno and Engineer Services, a company engaged by the building owners corporation, the body corporate, have been deemed safe to be reoccupied.  Yeah, what about the other?  Remember, it's 171 out of 392.  Looking at the building repairs, the report said the full details of the remediation measures were yet to be determined.  However, they agreed in principle to what was proposed to fix the issues.  The three authors also outlined five recommendations to avoid future incidents such as the one discussed in the report.  The creation of a registry of engineers.  Now to me, based in Queensland, this is surprising because Queensland, we've got a register of architects, we've got registers of building designers, we've got registers of everything.  Independent third-party certification of engineering designs.  a regime of critical stage on-site inspections by an independent registered engineer, raising transparency through the creation of an open repository for all certifications, the creation of a building structures review board.  New South Wales Minister for Better Regulation, Mark Keane, said the government supported the direction of the report's recommendations.  So, guys, I think it'll be interesting to go through the entire report.  But this is just adding, adding to all the examples of issues in our construction industry here in Australia.  It's just showing that we've got systematic failures.  Now, here's a question I have to all the libertarians that are watching this.  How would you... regulate this such a complex construction such a complex engineered feat without as a civilization us giving a other party authority over it to check the work and investing the resources in those people to allow it to happen.  i'm sure it's an interesting discussion and it comes into you know using taxpayer money to pay for that assessment but you know these are buildings that should last 50 to 100 years.  these are remains of our civilization that will go on beyond our lifespan.  are we going to leave a legacy of falling apart rubbish?  i wonder.  guys thanks for joining me for this episode.  please like share and subscribe.  ding the bell if you want to see me go through the entire report when i find it and i'll see you all next time.  bye for now.
