He comes back and says he's going to give me a warning and have a nice day.  As I tried to relax from the encounter, I realized this was a classic pretextual stop when an officer stops a driver for a minor traffic violation to allow them to investigate a separate and unrelated suspected criminal offense.  These stops are used disproportionately against African-Americans and people of color and are ripe for racial profiling.  Fortunately, I resorted to my training home over years of similar stops.  But I couldn't stop thinking about what happens to the young man or women who's not a lawyer or a county council member, hasn't honed their training on how to survive a stop, has an outstanding traffic ticket or bench warrant they don't know about, and how this situation could have escalated.  Aside from the fact the Fourth Amendment barring illegal search and seizure should mean something, these tactics erode public trust in law enforcement and must stop.

Just one moment.  All right, folks, they're back.  MarijuanaStock.org is another great investment opportunity.  If you were lucky enough to invest in their last crowdfunding campaign, you know they raised a lot of money in just a few months investing in legal marijuana farms.  Those initial investors now own shares of a publicly traded company.  Last time, of course, again, a lot of you missed it.  Now you have a second opportunity for a new investment opportunity that is as good or not better than the last time.  I'm talking about industrial hemp CBD.  For those who don't know, the hemp plant is the cousin to marijuana with a much higher concentration of CBD, which means hemp CBD gives you all of the medical benefits of marijuana without getting you high.  Until recently, hemp farming was practically illegal in the U.S.  and heavily regulated by the DEA.  But the 2018 Farm Bill signed into law makes it illegal to grow hemp CBD in the  U.S.,  creating one of the largest commodities worldwide.  They need land and to grow all of the plants.  This makes for an incredible investment opportunity, and that's where our good friends at 420 Real Estate come in.  Their business model is simple.  They buy land that supports hemp CBD grow operations and lease it to licensed, high-paying tenants.  That's right.  They are hemp CBD landlords.  And you can get in on the action, folks.  You can invest in this crowdfunding campaign for as little as $200 up to $10,000.  Like I said, you don't want to miss out on this opportunity.  You should go to MarijuanaStock.org.
