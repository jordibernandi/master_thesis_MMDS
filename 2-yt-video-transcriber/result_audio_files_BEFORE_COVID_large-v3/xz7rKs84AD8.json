Go devils!  You know they're not accredited, right?  He should have gone to trump you.  At least he could have gotten a good stake out of it.  I don't know about good, but Pete continues. ",

It's not like good and evil are an actual thing floating somewhere out in space, somehow breaking through the atmosphere and infecting us all.  Nor are there demons or devils who personify evil, poking us with their pitchforks and tempting us to harm each other.  Good and evil do not exist independent of the consciousness of sentient beings capable of judging something as being either positive or negative.  Good and evil come from us and our near universal preference as a species to avoid things which cause pain or threaten our existence.  Those things we consider evil.  things which prolong or protect our existence, and things which either alleviate pain or add value to our lives we consider good.  And we're not the only species able to make such observations and act on them.  We are the only ones who use those words, good and evil, to describe these preferences.  But that's our bad.  and good.  Next up.  For the sake of time, I'm going to tell you that Pete's possibilities are not atheist answers to the question of where good and evil come from.  They're possible answers to the question of how we understand what we call good and evil and ways that understanding might be used to address questions of well-being.  But atheists don't think good and evil come from anywhere because there are no atheist positions or dogmas beyond a lack of belief in God or gods.  Also, I can't imagine most atheists thinking good and evil are things which exist independent from the consciousness of sentient beings.  And the peak goes on. ",

Ironically, Pete uses the example of slavery to make his point.  Perhaps he doesn't know that slavery is tolerated by the tribal war god of Abraham, whose existence he's arguing for?

Perhaps if I said that I found it objectively unacceptable, but I don't.  I recognize that our morality evolves, so I find it unacceptable based on human experience, empathy, education, understanding, etc.  That evolution of our moral sense I talked about earlier, based on the moral axioms emanating from our species' understanding of the good and evil described earlier, avoidance of pain and or threats to life, etc.  You were listening, you heard it.  We'll pick this up from here in our next video.  Until then, don't eat the cheese if it looks funky.  Unless it's one of those cheeses that's supposed to look funky.  Thanks for watching.  Hi, I'm Brian Dalton.  You may know me from my role as the wacky Mr.  Deity here on YouTube.  But at the end of the day, my favorite role is that of an educator.  Like you, I'm concerned about the declining level of education in this country.  And nowhere is that more evident than among the religious.  So I'm doing something about it.  In study after study, scientists have discovered that nothing is more associated with intelligence, happiness, health, and honesty.  as You guessed it, swearing.  Which is why today I'm announcing Polluteflix.  Think of Polluteflix as a Netflix for motherfuckers who know the value of a really good asshole or cocksucker.  How are we dong this?  Doing this?  Well, first off, we're focusing all of our goddamn attention on those shitbags who need it most, the uber-religious.  We're taking some of those fucked-up Christian films from the last few years and adding swearing, cursing, obscene hand gestures, and where inappropriate, full frontal nudity.  If Christians will just give us a fair suck of the salve, we're confident they'll be able to see how they've been getting buggered all these years by these hypocritical wankers and twats.  And if you haven't picked up on it already, yes, We're planning international versions for our friends in Great Britain and Australia.  Hell, if we can raise enough money, we're also planning our own versions of the New Fucking Testament and the Titty Suck Torah.  I shit you not.  How can you help?  Go to patreon.com forward slash MrDeity.  The link is in the description below.  and become a patron, dickwads.  Even $1 per video will help us bring these ignorant fucktwits out of the darkness.  Think of how good we'll all feel when these brainwashed tightasses lighten up.  You'll be proud to say, holy jumping fucking Jesus, I was a part of that.  So help me launch Polluteflix and save this country from another goddamn God-caused dark ages.  If we don't, if we let this shitstorm continue, we all might as well bend over and pick up the soap.  And I'm talking no lubricant of any kind.  It will not be pleasant.  Polluteflix for motherfuckers who know the value of a really good asshole. ",
