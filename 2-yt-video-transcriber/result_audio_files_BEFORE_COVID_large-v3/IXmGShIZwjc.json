            "text": "This video is sponsored by me and CryptoTab.  So basically CryptoTab is a Chrome based browser that allows you to mine Bitcoin by doing absolutely nothing.  You need no equipment.  All you need to do is just turn on the mining.  And the browser will passively mine Bitcoin in the background while you do whatever.  It is literally that simple to get your foothold into cryptocurrency.  And considering the fact that cryptocurrency is... These Bitcoin in particular is pretty up there.  It might be nice to get just a little bit little nickels and dime in the crypto tab.  Now another thing that's cool about crypto tab is the fact that you can increase the amount of cryptocurrency you earn by referring other people to your mining network and building a gigantic cloud.  of miners.  And that is precisely what I'm trying to do.  So please, my friends, go ahead and download the CryptoTab browser in the description box below and somewhere in the comment section.  Help me build up my own cloud mining network and also help yourself to some sweet, sweet Bitcoin.  Now, let us begin the video.  so this video was actually a little while in the making.  this is actually a meme i was referring to or a post at the very least i was referring to in an older video i made when i was talking about incels and i figured that now was as good a time as any to finally put this video into production and upload it so you guys can see because I've been seeing a couple of videos again of people talking about incels and they just seem to not be able to grasp the bigger picture or the main idea.  And I'm going to first explain why I believe this to be the case briefly and probably this will spin off into its own video at some point in the future.  And that is a lot of people are hung up on stereotypes of men and masculinity.  And that is that we're horndogs and we only look at women as things to put our penises inside of.  Basically, we only look towards women to masturbate with or masturbate to rather than as individuals to have relationships with.  And this is, of course, projected onto incels probably a lot harder than it is normally projected onto, you'd probably say, like even the alpha male Chad type character that we see, which really is just a character.  It really isn't really a natural form you would see in society, I would say.  And again, I can spin off and talk about that forever, but I won't.  Um, instead, I just kind of want to say this first, that it seems the sexual revolution has done very little for a lot of people and has only led to just the complete and utter annihilation of Of the male-female dynamic.  And I know that's quite the hot take from people over here.  But seriously.  Our obsession with like sex and sexuality.  Especially between men and women.  It's only been boiled down to this disgusting degree.  Where this is the only thing that is possible and capable between men and women.  That it seems that the idea that an incel is someone who wants a woman to love them.  is foreign to everyone.  Everyone only focuses on, oh, these guys just want to get laid.  The truth of the matter is, if you talk to these incels and you listen, you'll learn that they want something that a lot of people don't even think women are capable of doing, and that is loving them back.  Now, that's a conversation that 100% should be had.  It's a very interesting conversation and sad one, but I just want to say this.  I think we all need to really take a step back, especially if you made it to this video and on my channel.  to take a step back and remember and recognize that sex is pretty friggin' good, at least from what I've heard.  And I imagine that it's a very beautiful thing, and I imagine it's a very pleasurable thing, but there's more to our lives, especially between men and women, than just that.  Now, I'm going to read this meme out, uh... Brain cells was a subreddit that was a replacement for incels on subreddit because reddit decided that incels were bad people and they should be purged.  And incels, I think, effectively, for the most part, the shitposting type of incels have been purged from reddit.  I'm pretty sure you could still find some incels somewhere scattered about in different areas.  But the brain cells subreddit used to be a place where a lot of incels came and they just pretty much coped and they just uploaded a bunch of funny memes.  It's hilarious and it's complete and utter bullshit how they got banned from Reddit.  because they were banned because they were supposedly inciting bullying and harassment.  The irony being the only people they bullied and harassed were themselves because all they ever did was talk about suicide or they just made shitposts about being an incel or maybe Chad or maybe Stacey or whatever.  Basically, I mean, fictionalized characters, they were never even targeted towards anyone.  So it was just nonsense.  It was complete and utter nonsense.  But they got banned.  Now, this is one of the few things I was able to get off of brain cells before they were kicked off of Reddit.  And I think it pretty much tells the entire... It's the whole picture.  It's the entire picture of what incels want.  Now, of course... It's going to come up some people somewhere probably going to talk about misogyny and hatred and the things.  We're just going to save that.  I mean this is a long ass introduction but let's actually get into the post so you guys can see what I'm talking about.  So obviously this is a translation but that's really neither here nor there.  I just want to acknowledge it because I'm sure someone else will.  But let's just take this one step by step.  So basically this is a little short mini comic of a young lady talking to her lover.  So let's see what she says.  Remember the day when I borrowed your brand new car and dented it?  And obviously if you look in the background she did a little bit more than dent it.  I thought you'd kill me, but you didn't.  Remember the day I vomited strawberry pie all over your new carpet?  I thought you'd hate me, but you didn't.  Remember the day I dragged you to the beach and it was raining as you said it would?  I thought you'd say, I told you so, but you didn't.  Remember the day I forgot to tell you that dance was formal wear and you ended up wearing jeans?  I thought you'd abandon me, but you didn't.  But you put up with me, loved me, protected me.  Yes, there were lots of things you didn't do.  Like hug a girl, or kiss her, or sleep next to her, or see any desire for you in her eyes.  This is nothing but idiotic hallucinations of a life you'll never have.  Of happiness you'll never feel.  In reality, I would fuck Chad.  They complain that all men are scum when he inevitably cheats on me because he had hundreds of other girls wanting to fuck him too rather than hold your hand while you rot alone in your room as you have your whole life.  And no one will ever empathize with your pain because the whole world denies that sexual selection by female mate choice is happening to protect women's sexual freedoms.  Dirty incel.  Now, I'm sure some people are probably going to harp on the fact that this little mini-comic paints the woman as someone that's virtually incompetent and kind of selfish.  But that's not really the point.  And I'm sure some other people will probably look at this little mini-comic and be upset at the fact that at the end of it all, this incel, whoever created this, turned the woman out into be someone who is selfish and kind of cruel.  and someone that is only preoccupied with chat or whatever.  Now, the unfortunate truth of the matter is, we can't pretend that we don't live in a world where women do not treat incels with this degree of derision.  Now, it's probably never spoken or verbally spoken as clear and concise as this mini-comic makes it, but we cannot pretend that this doesn't happen.  We can't not only pretend that this doesn't happen, which is one of the most frustrating things to me when on this topic of incels but we also can't pretend that women don't feel this way about incels.  almost in general it's very safe to say that there are very very few women that have any degree of sympathy or empathy for incels.  Um, which I think is kind of a general trend, in fact, and not even just that, especially left leaning liberal type people, ironically, really don't have any degree of empathy for these type of people and are very quick to kind of dismiss them and are very quick to look at them as sexist and misogynistic and cruel and evil.  And the thing is, it's not understandable to me.  It's never been understandable to me to use outliers of people as the yardstick to measure everyone.  It just seems kind of dumb to me.  No matter what we're talking about, race, sex, sexuality, even with you have some rather cruel homosexuals who will get into entire relationships with people, have children, and then cheat on their spouse with their gay lover and then get a divorce with them.  That happens with a lot of homosexuals, right?  But no one talks about that deception and that cruelty, that genuine evil of deceiving someone for years and then breaking your family apart to go be with your homosexual lover.  If I measured all homosexuals based on that, people would call me a homophobe, right?  But for some reason, that evil cruelty, no one really wants to even talk about that.  Now, of course, it sounds like I'm just making some random tangent, but here's my point.  My ultimate point is, you can find evil in groups of people no matter where you look.  Because evil is in all of humanity.  It's obvious.  At least it should be obvious to people.  It's obvious to me.  And yet, if I take this yardstick and I use it for homosexuals, everyone could see how silly and foolish that is.  But with incels, we don't see that.  And I think the reason why is oftentimes just to kind of have a scapegoat for this type of derision and for this type of, you know, divide and conquer tactics.  that I would say if I put on my conspiracy theorist hat on that the higher-ups want us to have.  But, yeah, that kind of goes beyond the scope of this video.  What I really want to focus on in this video is what incels really want.  It's really easy to look at, you know, incel.me or whatever forum and all the nasty incels who are mean and cruel and hateful and spiteful.  But, like I say, I see to the lives of the Jedi.  Like, I know that these people... What they really want.  They want a woman to love them.  That's it.  They want to love a woman and they want to be loved by a woman.  And our sex crazed society always wants us to highlight the fact that these guys are just talking about the fact that they just want to put their dicks inside women.  But it's more than that.  Sex is more than that to some people.  People treat sex like it's a bowel movement, you know what I mean?  They treat sex like it's just some kind of recreational activity you just do with someone of the opposite sex.  But these people are trying to treat it as an expression of love and appreciation for someone.  Almost also as a way to kind of confirm their own value.  And that's another thing.  that's also really, really disheartening is the fact that for men, sex isn't simply just kind of something that you do.  The favor of a woman is what affirms your very existence.  And that might sound a little melodramatic because it is melodramatic.  And it might sound really silly because it is really silly.  It is really silly.  Like it's not having a relationship with a woman.  It's not having a family with a woman.  It's putting your dick inside of her.  that affirms you as a male to some people.  How stupid is that?  What makes you different from any other man after having your penis lick with a woman's juices?  And the reason why I'm so crude about that is because I want you guys to look at what we're literally talking about.  We're not talking about raising children, giving them your life skills, giving them your wisdom, protecting them from bad things, teaching them martial arts, teaching them how to read.  We're not talking about a transfer of skill between your family.  Loving your wife, helping her with her problems, giving her a house, a home, stability.  We're not talking about any of that.  That's not what affirms you as a man.  What affirms you as a man to a lot of people in our society is simply having a woman find you desirable and having sex with her.  How absolutely absurd and silly is that?  But no one thinks about it.  Hardly, seldom does anyone even challenge it.  And these incels have all internalized that very clear and obvious truth of society.  that they want to be affirmed by women.  And sex is only just one part of what they want.  What a lot of them really want, again, is this relationship, this reciprocation.  They want to be able to love someone and then get it back.  And they want sex to be that manifestation of that effort, sex to be a manifestation of that love and caring that they have.  And these are the people that are villainized Almost the most in our contemporary time period.  Now maybe someone in 2020 might overtake themselves.  But I don't know.  I don't really see that happening anytime soon.  We'll see.  But these are the type of people who have internalized the same exact message everyone has internalized.  And they're just the ones who have failed.  Look at all of the Chad alpha male channels that you see.  What is the same?  It's the same bullshit.  You're not a man because you taught children how to defend themselves.  You're not a man because you you gave your child life skills and you helped him out.  you're not a man because you help other people and you affirm their identity and you treat them well.  and You're not a man because you have honor and integrity.  You're not a man because you're wise.  You're not a man because you've helped out society.  You're a man or you're a chad because you're dominant and you get girls to suck you off.  That's what we aspire to be.  And the incels are the ones who are insulted and treated with derision and hatred because they just listened to the programming that was given to us.  Because they want more than the program that was given to us?  That they want the woman to love them and care about them?  They're the villains?  At the end of the day, what incels want is what everyone wants, man.  They want to be loved.  That's it.  That's what this whole comic is about.  It's about the fact that they want to be loved by someone and nobody cares about the fact that they want to be loved and no one wants to acknowledge the fact that this nonsensical idea of having a woman's favor is what makes you a man or having a woman's favor is what gives you identity and gives you value.  If it's not what makes you a man, it's definitely what gives you value as a man, as a human being.  Hell, if you look at most of the insults any woman will ever paint at you against a man, it's always that you can't get laid.  What is that insult saying?  Women don't like you.  The ultimate insult against a man is that women don't want you.  How silly and stupid is that?  And I mean, if you really look at the type of men that a lot of women will pride themselves being around, what are they?  Are they intelligent human beings?  Are they wise?  Are they kind?  Do they have virtue and integrity?  No, those aren't the values that women are espousing for attractive men or worthy men.  It's either you have the feminist idea of the male feminist who listens to women and affirms their identities and their allies and all their bullshit.  Or you have the stereotypical jock or chad type character.  He has tattoos.  He's big and killer.  Lots of ladies want him.  But where's his kindness?  This is the same guy that cheats on all these different girls that women love to bitch and complain about.  Where is his virtue?  Where is his honor?  None of those traits are highlighted.  He's just sexually attractive to them.  And that's it.  It begins and ends there.  So, at the end of this video, what I want to say is this.  Incels want what everyone wants.  They want to be loved.  And they want to be treated with some degree of empathy.  Is there evil within incels?  Yes, because there's evil everywhere in our society.  And you're not going to be able to weed out these evil incels by putting everyone in the same bucket and calling them all stupid, terrible, horrible, misogynistic people that don't know what they're talking about.  You beat evil with good.  Which means we have to acknowledge the fact that some of these incels are lonely people that want to be loved.
