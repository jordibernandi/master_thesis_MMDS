What do you make of the Treasury Secretary's assertion that this one aerospace giant is poised to cause an issue for the overall growth of the U.S.  economy moving forward? ",

And I expect it to rise rather dramatically over time.  And that's not going to be a good thing for the US.  That's going to be a bad thing because it's going to make imports more expensive for Americans.  So it's going to reduce our standard of living.  And I do think ultimately it's going to push up interest rates.  as well as the Chinese and a lot of other creditors are no longer lending money to Americans.  And so we have to draw from our own savings pool which is extremely shallow.  It means the Federal Reserve is going to be printing a lot more money as it monetizes the debt that the Chinese and other nations no longer want to buy.

I mean, they did that deliberately because they wanted to maintain exports to the United States.  But I think that was a key mistake.  I mean, it helped America because we got to live beyond our means.  But I don't think it did anything for the Chinese economy.  In fact, it helped undermine it.  because they accumulated a huge pool of U.S.  dollars that they ended up doing things with.  that created malinvestments and other distortions.  I think the best thing that can happen to China is to simply allow their currency to appreciate, to reduce their exports to the United States because we can't afford to pay for those products, to let their own nations consume that production.  so that their own people can benefit from their hard work.  But unfortunately, Americans are going to have a rude awakening when all of a sudden we have to live within our means.  And our means have been dramatically diminished over the years.  We haven't been investing.  We haven't been saving.  We've been relying on an overvalued currency to import what the rest of the world produces.  And we haven't saved very much.  We've just been borrowing money to consume.  And all this is going to come back to bite us. ",
