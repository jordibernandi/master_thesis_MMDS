But the website BuzzFeed, one of the most important news sites in the United States, has proven that this woman, Sagar Kasraei, is not an ordinary American Iranian who has taken a movie from her living room with a simple mobile phone for awareness.  Rather, she is an arms dealer for an armed group called the Liberation Army in Libya.  The Liberation Army is the same armed group that has killed Libya and has become one of the reasons for the collapse of retail markets in this country.  that is killing most people in Yemen.  Ms.  Kasraei, who is a co-worker of Tanga Tangi, thinks that Bolton's plan to arm the nationalities has tarnished the unity of Iran and turned it into nothing.  One of the media commentators wrote about this woman, this video has been recorded in this way to gain the trust of the audience.  And finally, an Iranian flag has been erected to speak on behalf of all Iranians.  And, of course, a female player has been chosen to create intimacy.  The most natural film that is made by the most professional groups specializing in civil war and media war.  People like him and Amir Abbas Fakhravar, the anti-revolutionary Ferrari, which has been published in documents, have close relations with the lobby of the Zionist regime. ",
