            "text": "It's interesting finding out what Americans know about Canadian politics.  The only thing they do know is the name Justin Trudeau and even then it's Jason sometimes.  It's Jason most of the time.  Or that hot guy that's like president but in Canada.  usually that they're not wrong though like Justin Trudeau seems like a bit of an accident to me like I feel like the Canadian government.  we're having a meeting on how to make their politics a little bit more sexy and then Justin burst into the room and he was like is this where the auditions for rent are?  I'm single.  Hold for applause.  Hold for applause.  Okay, sorry.  Says it in the prompter.  I was down there for the election, and all my friends were like, Amanda, you must be getting so many marriage proposals.  And I did not.  At all.  Except for one sketchy dude that was like, do you want to be blood brothers?  And I was like, yeah, I'm going to count it.  I will count it.  I'll be your blood brother.  Are you together?  Okay, never mind.  I'm an invisible lady in  L.A.,  and I'm not being... I'm not beating myself up.  It's just a fact.  Like, in Canada, I think I could be maybe a seven.  And in  L.A.,  I'm a shape.  I'm not even a number.  Just a shape of a woman.  They're like, what is it?  What are you?  I'll give you an example.  I was in a bar one time, and a handsome man was beside me, and I smiled at him.  And then he took a swig of his beer, burped, and then blew it in my face.  I learned a lot about myself in that moment.  Because I just sort of closed my eyes and let it wash over me like a sea breeze.  I was like, there's that California Arab I've been hearing all about.  There it is.  I get called out on apologizing a lot, which we do.  We say sorry correct, by the way.  Do you guys agree we say it correct?  Sorry.  I think that they just don't know how to say it because they never do it or they just like blame it on the nearest person and or country.  They just do that.  But we do apologize too much.  Like, I remember when I was a kid, I was at a festival and a man burnt me with a cigarette and I apologized to him.  I don't really remember what happened.  I think I was just like, I'm sorry for getting in the way of your cancer baton, my liege.  I'm worried that I apologize to the point of like, like what will happen at my funeral?  Someone will get on stage with like a pre-written script I've written.  Amanda's really sorry she couldn't make it here today.  But at least she died doing what she loved.  Apologizing to a falling tree.  Thank you guys so much. ",
