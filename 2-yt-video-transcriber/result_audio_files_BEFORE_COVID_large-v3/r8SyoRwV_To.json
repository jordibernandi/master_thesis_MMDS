I mean, in the back of her Tesla.  There's everything.  This is a car full of climate contraband.  And we're going to ask these folks here at the COP25 summit what they think about it before they know that it's Greta's car, of course.  We'll tell them that after the fact.

We watched them cycle through the stages of grief, not believing that St.  Greta was a sinner, just like everybody else.  For Rebel News in Madrid, I'm Kian Bextie.  There is nobody at this conference exposing Greta as the sinner that she is.  And boy, oh boy, is she a climate sinner.  The climate contraband was riddled throughout her car, and nobody in the mainstream media would dare publish something like that, but we would here at Rebel News.  You can see all of our footage at rebelun.com.  You can pitch in a few bucks to help us out with our costs.  They're very expensive to get us out here to talk to all of these Greta deniers, because that's what they are.  They're the real deniers.  They don't believe that Greta is a sinner, but facts are facts.  Please go to rebelun.com to pitch in a few bucks, help us with our coverage so that we can get home and keep doing our jobs.
