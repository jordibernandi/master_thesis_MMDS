            "text": "The long-standing international system is under pressure, and its future is uncertain and unknown.  The international economic and security structures created at the end of World War II are at risk of dissolving, and in some cases already have.  State borders in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe are being challenged, and the dispersion of state sovereignty is leaving a leadership vacuum.  Despite these changes, the State Department must still be able to handle the old system while also being prepared for the new global arrangement.  To accomplish this, America needs an educated diplomatic corps from the Secretary of State down to newly commissioned Foreign Service officers that is devoid of internal and domestic politicking.  One step is to return diplomatic responsibility and accountability to the Department of State, away from the independent forces inside the White House that have come to oversee specific issues and relationships.  The next step is raising the stature of the Foreign Service Institute, which trains diplomats and foreign affairs professionals to the equivalent of a first-class university to ensure America's diplomatic core is knowledgeably prepared for an uncertain future.  A shifting international system doesn't mean the U.S.  can continue to be a global leader.  In fact, a system under pressure needs a strong American diplomatic presence to preserve and ensure stability and peace. ",
