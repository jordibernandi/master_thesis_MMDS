            "text": "This is your brother Malcolm coming at you with another lesson.  I'd like to say Shalom to all my fellow laborers, to the confused and the face joined, and to our ranks, to the Akwa, the hopefully elect that are listening and learning.  To you I say Shalom.  There's a On the screen here.  You're looking at The image of What science says.  the first Swedes Look like on the left here Which they lie.  The science is a lie But this is the truth.  And I'm going to play a video That pretty much got.  I made a big deal out of the video But it seemed like no one else really uh... talked about this video.  so i know i spoke about it a lot and i used it quite a few times in my teaching even learned from it.  okay but uh... what you have to understand is that the same way grease went from from dark to pale alright is pretty much the same thing that happened during the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages.  Because when Esau came into power during the Renaissance, he whitewashed history.  And he went throughout Europe, all different parts of Europe, destroying the icons and images left, but there were so many that he couldn't get them all.  There are still thousands of images left that have these dark faces on them.  all from Germany to Sweden, from Russia all the way back to Britain.  The evidence is overwhelming, all right?  But Esau Edom just chooses to ignore the truth.  And we're living in a time and the age when the truth is being manifest, all right?  I'm trying to remember this scripture.  Which is leaving me right now.  And it says something to the effect.  Ah, found it.  Through the Spirit.  Came right up on it.  It's Luke 8 and 17.  And it reads, For nothing is secret that should not be made manifest, neither anything here that shall not be known and come abroad.  And just like Esau Edom, the so-called white man, self-proclaimed, has been proven and found out to be the biblical Edomites.  There, you have to understand, all their history is based upon lies, okay?  There was, let's see if I can go back.  Let's look at a moment of this play. ",

But this is a video that was done a couple years back.  um, this video should have hundreds of thousands of views.  It's called the etymology of, uh, uh, of, uh, Bluetooth.  And it was by great millstone in Philadelphia.  And, uh, because the history that he brought out in this was so important and on such a high level is so relevant to our teachings.  It's, it's just like, uh, knowing that the, that information, uh, about Esau Edom labeled himself as white in 1681 in Virginia.  That can be proven, right?  That can be proven through the research of Theodore Allen, Dr.  Jacqueline Battelore, and Dr.  Robin D'Angelo, all right?  They prescribed that name to themselves in 1681.  And then what happened in the 1700s?  The whole white superiority doctrine advanced from that point, and they fabricated the three different people and matched it up with the Bible.  They took Darwinism and married it to the Bible, and they married Negro, Caucasoid, and Mongoloid, and they married it to Ham, Sham, and Japheth.  Then they turn around and try to make some of Ham's children white to fit their Christianity lives.  But it just goes to show you how much of bullshit Esau Edom is.  But without any further ado, we're going to go into the history of Harold Bluetooth and let this video play.  I just wish the brother had... A what? ",

            "text": "It's one of many numerous artifacts our people made to validate their presence throughout Europe.  And the point is, the white man is the fucking devil.  That's not his history.  He stole our history.  history, this so-called Black, Latino, Native American history, even though the so-called Latin tribes or Native Americans so-called were over here in the Americas, this is still their history because they're Israelites.  Again, if I didn't mention it, this stone was created by Harold Bluetooth and it commemorated the unification of Denmark and also Danish or the Danes of Denmark's conversion to Christianity, which at this time This is around the 10th century.  These were the Vikings.  That's another topic.  The Vikings being so-called black people or people of color.  Overall, they were Israelites.  And again, the so-called white man is a devil that the Bible speaks of.  Part 2, which is the main entree, dealing with the man who erected that monument.  His name was Harold Bluetooth.  And you're going to find out the word Bluetooth in his name has nothing to do with him having a blue tooth.  It actually signified that he was a dark-skinned man.  And I'm going to thoroughly prove it, leaving no stone unturned.  This is from Wikipedia.  Harold Bluetooth.  Harold, which simply means commander of an army.  Bluetooth, which you're going to find out means dark skin.  And Gorm's son is son of Gorm, which was his father.  His father's name was Gorm the Old.  And the word Gorm, you're going to find out, meant dark skin.  So his father had the same appellation or stigma of being called dark skin, which that was the stigma applied to our people throughout history.  Why?  Because the main reason why was because the so-called white man or the Edomite nation was going to rule the planet Earth and deceive and corrupt the minds of the people.  It says Harold Bluetooth Gormson, Old Norse Danish, and they have those words that say the same thing.  Harold Bluetooth Gormson.  It says, probably born around 935 AD, was a king of Denmark and Norway.  He was the son of King Gorm the Old, which again, the word Gorm approved means dark skin, and of Daira Danbo.  He died in 985 or 986, having ruled as king of Denmark.  from around 958 A.D.  and King of Norway for a few years, probably around 970 A.D Some sources say his son, Svend Folkberd, forcibly disposed him as king, and hopefully this lesson is very edifying.

            "text": "Okay, jumping to the next point.  Most of the information I have is from random sources, which overall validates my point, which my point I'm trying to make in this lesson is that Harold Bluetooth actually signified that he was dark-skinned and had nothing to do with his actual tooth.  So jumping to the next bit of information, it says, this is Ian Davies, and he's from Goldford, UK, and he says, I'm told that King Harold Bluetooth lived in Denmark between 910, 940  A.D.,  And his name had nothing to do with a blue tooth.  So that proved my point right there.  It means dark complexion.  Which was unusual for Vikings.  Because he subscribes to that.  To the nonsense that the Vikings were.  Were crackers.  Or Edomites.  That's bullshit.  They were so called black people.  Overall they were Israelites.  It says not only did Harold not fit the classic image physically.  He was a rather unusual Viking.  The good king Harold brought Christianity.  To Scandinavia.  And that Christianity was not created by so-called white people, okay?  It was created by so-called blacks. ",

Similarly, modern Bluetooth technology, that's where you get the word Bluetooth from in modern new shits.  You get it from King Harold Bluetooth, an Israelite.  It says, similarly, modern Bluetooth technology unites separate computers, machines, and electronic gadgets.  Continuing on, it says, Jonathan Gardner, London.  More important is this, did Harold Bluetooth have blue teeth?  If he didn't, why was he so called?  Alex Wills says, From Hong Kong, China replied, the name Bluetooth is the result of confusion between old Danish words and modern ones.  So here we're dealing with the etymology, the etym, the true sense of the word or the origin of the word.  And this is what most guys are offended at, the meaning of words.  Okay, so it says again, the name Bluetooth is the result of confusion Between old Danish words and modern ones.  You see.  Blah is the modern Danish word for blue.  But once meant dark skin.  See.  I mean that's all man.  But I'm going to keep going.  I got more information. ",

He said that relics are more important than a written word in some cases because, you know, authors and writers can write what they want, but the relic speaks volumes and speaks the truth about what really was happening in a particular place and what people were really there.  And when you go back and you will find that all throughout Sweden there were castles that have black faces so-called black faces carved in them.  and then they come up with these crazy elaborate stories as to why.  who carves faces of their slaves into the sides of their their castle with their family name on it you know.  hey so with that I hope this was an edifying and revealing lesson.  you know there and nothing hid shall stay hidden.  man the Lord reveals all all right and with that All praise is going on and beyond to you.
