And actual criticism of Israeli policies is completely legitimate.  But some extreme politicians attempt to use their criticism of Israel as a cover for their thinly veiled racism.  That's not our opinion.  It's the opinion of the mainstream leadership of the Democratic Party.  Secondly, look at the source.  AJ Plus is actually Al Jazeera, which is funded by the Qatari government, which has also invested over half a billion dollars in terror organizations like Hamas.  In fact, many Arab countries have cut ties with Qatar due to its extremism.  And Al Jazeera frequently publishes content like this.  Is this really who you want explaining anti-Semitism to you?  And finally, there already is a working definition of antisemitism adopted by many countries in the Western world.  But Al Jazeera doesn't want you to know that because that would carry more weight than their token Jewish comedian.  Countries that fund terrorism are not a credible source of education about antisemitism.  Tokenizing Jews or anyone else is in itself a form of racism.  And we should never apply racist double standards to the Jewish people or to any group of people.  Ever. ",
