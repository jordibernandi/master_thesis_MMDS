I don't know if this dude got in a fight with somebody.  The way they treated him because he went and put down a spray nozzle is not right.  It looks like they're treating somebody over there.  I guess he must have gotten in a fight with this guy.  And then this guy over here.  I think he's the one that called the cops and tried to fight him or something.  How are you doing over there?
