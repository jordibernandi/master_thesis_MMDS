There's so much going on and there's so much horrendous treason and fighting back.  So this is... bombard body language.  I personally think she's an extremely good expose of what is really behind the hidden smiles and the dangerous deception that is going on.  So let's start with this body language, most recent one of Theresa May. ",

Even now, sitting there watching her read her speech or her notes, she's not really moving.  Usually when you see Theresa May, yeah, she has her quick jerky moments as she looks, but she does look a little longer than half a second.  It's quick up and down.  and barely the up part.  She's also not moving any other part.  She's worn this coat.  I swear, I think she's done it on purpose to hide.  It's got that really big collar.  It envelops her shoulders.  It's very loose in there, so you can't see what, but when you're looking, she's still not moving that much.  She's hiding.  So we see the legs come in.  We're making ourselves small.  We're doing barely any movement at the top.  Short, short burst of looking at her audience, and she's in hiding moments.  Basically, she's keeping her cards very close.  It's an American saying.  Your plan is being hidden.  You're trying to hide that plan from your audience.  And no, it's not a plan for you.  Which is my key request of my fellow leaders.  For example, this means that if we're able to... Key request of fellow leaders, and you see her kind of actually stretch out her back and go up.  I wouldn't give this much credence.  Because she's keeping herself so tight in a downward small movement, she actually just might be stretching.  Remember what we've said.  When you get someone who's that stressed and they're hiding and their muscles go tight, they do have to stretch a whole lot more than a normal person.  Because it gets uncomfortable.  Hold your hand in a position that's not natural nor normal.  You're going to have to stretch a lot more often.  We will not have to take part in European elections and will officially leave the EU on Saturday, the 1st of June.  The fact that she doesn't give real good eye contact on the actual date that we could leave the 1st of June... That's a no.  So you're not going to leave the first June.  The rest of it where she barely gives eye contact on the key points.  when you speak a sentence, you've got the subject, the predicate, the verb.  Those are like those key words in that sentence that you give the appropriate body language to.  It sounds very generic, but I'm trying to explain.  So when you see someone give good eye contact on the word the or of or have, It means that they're not looking at you with any bump to that sentence.  It's just a red sentence.  So nothing in that sentence has any validity.  The UK should have left the EU by now.  And I sincerely regret it.  Well, that's another interesting.  So she starts out strong, giving eye contact to the audience.  The UK should have left.  And then she goes down pretty much halfway through that.  Well, obviously, many of you already know she's a remainder. ",

Very interesting.  Andrew Marr goes, can I ask you, and we'll go on from there. ",
