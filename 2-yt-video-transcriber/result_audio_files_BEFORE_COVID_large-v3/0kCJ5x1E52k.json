            "text": "Hey everybody, I hope you're doing great.  This is a video that is a follow-up to a video I did on Torben Sondergaard about two years ago.  If you don't know who Torben is, he's the leader of a movement called The Last Reformation.  We have a lot to cover today, so let's jump right in.  When I started following Torben years ago, one of the clips I saw showed him sharing the gospel in the correct way and addressing sin and repentance, unlike we see in those that are involved with the New Apostolic Movement.  But we have to remember that many false teachers know the truth, can preach the truth, and yet aren't saved themselves, or they don't actually believe it.  Some atheists even know the Bible better than many Christians.  So just because a person says many of the right things doesn't really mean they're a believer.  I fellowshiped with a small group here in the Philippines that also followed his teachings.  But one day when praying for clarity on some of his teachings, God opened my eyes to the errors of his ways by bringing scripture to my mind that refuted what Torben was saying.  When I showed these friends that scripture did not back what he was teaching, they chose to believe Torben rather than the Bible and turned their backs on me.  A true cult mentality that I've experienced from others in this movement as well.  Now this is a huge organization that is all over the world and growing at an exponential rate.  I know people that have sold everything and committed their lives to spreading Torben's message around the world.  So I just want to start by making a list of some of his false teachings and his practices.  You may have already seen in my other videos where he does the same false healing leg trick others do and teaches people to do this.  If you haven't seen this, I'll leave a link at the end of this video.  He also believes that someone that has just been born again can still have a demon or demons and makes a practice of casting out demons during their baptism.  He says that everybody will prophesy and speak in tongues.  He unbiblically speaks in gibberish all the time, especially when supposedly casting out demons during baptism.  He believes in baptismal regeneration and that it's part of salvation.  And he teaches that all believers will have all the signs in Mark 16 and that we can all heal.  He outright admits that he can teach people to heal.  While Torben isn't officially within the circle of people in Bethel and the New Apostolic Reformation, he does teach most of the same things and has even worked with Todd Bentley before.  I've watched over 36 hours of Torben's teachings online with his Pioneer Training School and today I'm going to go through his false teachings and give you the times in each of his videos that he said these things so you can check it out for yourself.  I wish I could take all the credit for taking the time to find all these errors and list them, but the credit goes to Jim Johnson who wrote the book The Last Reformation and Torben Sondergaard's False Teachings Exposed.  The first thing I want to talk about is the church because throughout Torben's teachings he often criticizes many aspects of the church and says that they're built on the wrong foundation and it's not what God wants.  He encourages everyone who listens to his teachings to leave their churches for a minimum of two months and focus on what he is teaching.  He says if people will do that, it'll change their lives.  Then they can start a new reformation of churches.  This is very typical of how many cults have started.  The foundation of his message is that the church must go back and operate like it did in the book of Acts.  He says people only met in homes and on the street, but this isn't true.  The Bible says the early church also met in the temple and in synagogues.  So here's just some of the things Torben says in his videos.  The church is completely opposite to what Jesus would do .  They only met in homes and on the street .  everything looks the same as the catholic church.  pastors say they are building on the word but don't realize they are building on everything from the catholic church from three hundred a d. most of what is in the church has to do with religion rather than jesus teachings.  There are almost no churches today who are preaching the truth when it comes to healing.  In the last church, just like the first, everybody is going to be healing the sick and casting out demons.  Really, Torben?  Where does it say that in Scripture?  It is so clear that everyone in the book of Acts who came to faith got baptized the same day.  Everyone repented and received the Holy Spirit.  Everybody.  well this is obviously not true.  we are supposed to have all three repentance water baptism and baptism of the holy spirit on the same day.  this was the normal church.  when we get saved in a church we get a mindset that is so different from what the word is saying.  i don't even know what to say to that one.  A new reformation is starting where God is going to take people out of the church and then make a new church with these people.  One of the most troubling topics is what Torben teaches about salvation.  Now, while Torben says that people cannot build theology on the book of Acts, that is exactly what he's done.  His entire theology about salvation is built around one verse from the book of Acts when Peter was preaching on the day of Pentecost.  Then Peter said to them, repent and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  Torben says the three things mentioned in that verse, repentance, water baptism, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, are the three requirements for salvation.  But not only that, that you must also live a holy life and being faithful until the end of life.  He says the new covenant is conditional and not something that is received by grace through faith as a gift from God.  He says that the three things are the conditions of the new covenant and that faith means obedience to these.  He is teaching that it is possible someone can lose their salvation if they do not always follow the Holy Spirit.  He says that not following the Holy Spirit is the unforgivable sin.  We know this is incorrect because Jesus said the unforgivable sin is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  Torben teaches a works-based salvation that says, if a person will properly do this and that and this and that, then maybe they will be saved.  Now that's not the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Torben's gospel is much different than the good news of Jesus.  Torben also teaches something that is quite different from people like Todd White when he preaches, and that the love of God is only for believers and that Christians should not speak to unbelievers about the love of God.  Here are some quotes from the videos in relation to salvation and about sharing with people about salvation.  We have to change our way of salvation.  I think the way the Bible tells us is just fine.  Changing what the Bible says actually has some pretty bad consequences.  What churches teach today is not the whole foundation for salvation that we see in the book of Acts.  Really?  A Christian is someone who repents, is baptized in water, and is filled with the Holy Spirit and lives the same way that Jesus did by going around and preaching the gospel, healing the sick, and casting out demons.  So, all Christians are supposed to heal the sick and cast out demons?  Well, we know from the Apostle Paul that we do not all have the same gifts and that healing is just one of them.  If someone asked Jesus what to do to be saved, he would say, repent and be baptized in water and be baptized in the Holy Spirit.  This is common in the signs and wonders movement that receiving the Holy Spirit when you are born again is different than the baptism of the Holy Spirit.  In baptism in water, you bury your old life, but this is not enough to be saved.  You also need to get baptized in the Holy Spirit because there you receive what you need to live a new life led by the Spirit, His own twisting of Scripture.  how can water save?  how can water be remission for sin?  how can water be putting on christ?  how can water be raising us in christ?  how can water wash away our sins?  physical things have spiritual impact for the jew.  they understood that.  So his implication here is salvation through baptism, not grace through faith.  In the book of Acts, everybody got baptized the same day.  Immediately when they heard the message about baptism, they got baptized.  Wrong.  The condition of the New Covenant is that we continue in the faith, are baptized in water, and are baptized in the Holy Spirit.  We are supposed to have all three on the same day.  This was normal church.  We have to change our way of salvation.  It's not only one thing, it's more things together.  Wow, what a confusing man-made doctrine.  The New Covenant is built on the condition of water baptism.  lies lies lies.  if you can't see it go through the book of acts and see.  the response was always water baptism on the same day.  it is so clear.  uh no it's not and that's not true.  when the bible is talking about grace and faith that saves us it is talking about the covenant that is built on grace and faith.  okay once again a total twisting of scripture.  we think under grace i can sin.  Well, anyone who thinks sin is okay after being saved, I think they might have to question their own salvation.  God hates sin, and no born-again believer thinks sinning is okay.  Yes, they may fall into sin, but anybody who sins thinking it's actually okay, I question their salvation.  If you believe that, then you have misunderstood faith.  Faith is obedience.  No, Hebrews 11.1 says, Obedience is something totally different.  God has called us not to believe in Him.  He has called us to know Him.  Well, I think he's called us for both, actually.  If you get sin out of your life, start to repent deep from your heart, the love of God will burn.  100% works doctrine.  If you are filled with the Holy Spirit, then you have personal speaking in tongues because this is for everybody.  No, it's not for everyone.  It's one of the gifts and we all have different gifts.  And there is no scripture that says we must or will speak with tongues after baptism.  You will hear something that you have never heard before.  We, the body, have turned everything upside down when it comes to what it means to be under the new covenant.  It's almost like I can be so bold to say that everything you have heard about the grace of God and about the new and old covenant have been a lie.  Wow, that's a bold statement.  So basically, the Bible is a lie.  Unbelievable.  Every one of us has an understanding that everyone who is under the new grace of the New Testament, we have a God that is not holy and fearful.  Wow.  To know if a person knows God, we need to look and see if they live a holy life.  That's a works-based maintenance of salvation, if I ever saw one.  God is not going to look at the good things in your life.  He's only going to look at the crime.  That's just crazy.  Actually, Torben, unbelievers will be judged on their unbelief and believers will actually be rewarded at the Bema Seat Judgment.  Luke 12.10 Every sin, everything you have done can be forgiven no matter what.  But if we sin against the Holy Spirit, we cannot be forgiven.  Now, Torben has changed Luke 12.10 which reads, And anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him.  But to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.  He changes words in two very important places.  First, from who speaks a word against the Son of Man to who sins against the Son of Man.  Secondly, from who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit to who sins against the Holy Spirit.  So, Not listening and following the prompting of the Holy Spirit is the unforgivable sin and we lose our salvation according to Torben.  He says, do I believe once saved always saved?  Yes, for those who are really saved when we eat of the tree of life in the last chapter of the Bible.  But he believes this happens after we die so there's no possible assurance of salvation until we're actually dead.  one day we cannot lose it.  referring to salvation that is the day we eat from the tree of life.  in the book of acts they were never preaching the love of god.  they were preaching the righteousness of god.  well it may not be in the book of acts but how about for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son?  we in the church have done something that is totally wrong many many years and because of that the world has turned against us.  we have preached the love of god instead of the righteousness of god.  that is why the world is against us.  well that is true with people like todd white.  they do this but not everybody does.  the gospels of john and matthew were written for believers.  if we bring the gospels of john or matthew to unbelievers they will misunderstand them.  He truly wants us to only focus on the book of Acts.  The Bible makes it very clear that the love of God is for us who believe, not the unbeliever.  How about for it's God's desire that none perish?  Sounds like love to me.  Now, Torben also says sometimes people put into the text what they want to fit their doctrine.  We find verses that suit us and then we copy on a paper and choose what we want from the Bible.  And we pick and choose how we want God to be.  Well, the problem is Torben is doing exactly what he says shouldn't be done.  I think the Bible calls that a hypocrite.  Here's some other things he says about healing.  it is god's will to heal everybody every time.  jesus could not heal in his own home town.  no mark six five says he healed everyone they brought to him but compared to other places it was not great.  everyone who came to him he healed.  Now, that's not what the verse says, but Torben teaches this to reinforce his teaching that everyone should be healed every time.  If someone in the church is sick, then you are not mature yet.  You don't understand what Jesus did on the cross.  You are not able to heal the sick.  They weren't able to be healed because the person praying had sin in their lives, so instead they need to call for someone who is righteous.  So these are all typical teachings from the New Apostolic Reformation, the Word of Faith movement, and all these other perversions of true Christianity.  So in conclusion, even though he's not officially a part of the Nara movement, I think he would definitely be categorized as somebody in the same camp.  he definitely teaches many false things and i believe is someone to be avoided at all costs.  so that's it for today.  as always please leave your comments below and if you did find this video useful remember to like share and subscribe and ring that bell so you can get all the future notifications.  i'll leave a link to his pioneer training school below where you can check out some of the quotes.  but until next time take care and god bless.
