            "text": "Hey everyone, we're beginning a new campaign called One Nation and One God.  For several months now, Holy Spirit has been dealing with me to go and declare the importance of the church making its stand.  The importance of filling a truth vacuum in this nation and then praying for this nation.  And so I want to schedule as many One Nation, One God nights that I possibly can.  I'd love to do a hundred before the next election.  where I come to your house if you will host one.  You gather the pastors in your region and the people and we'll pray.  I'll preach the word.  And I believe that if we will do this, God will help us turn our nation around.  We constantly hear, that our future is at stake.  Christian values are at stake and they are.  Our children's future and grandchildren's future is at stake.  I feel compelled to go out and declare this word that is in my heart that I believe will touch people and say, let's rise up and let's change things.  If you could possibly schedule one of these nights, please go to the website and let's do this. ",
