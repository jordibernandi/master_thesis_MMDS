            "text": "We're handing out flyers here at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and they're avoiding the flyers like the plague.  So what's the flyer say?  So this flyer, it says it's 10 reasons to protect the unborn.  We've heard it's a pretty liberal campus, so we're ready.  Hey, guys, what's happening?  We're just here defending life.  All right, cool.  It's great.  Because we don't like the murder of unborn children.  I hate this.  If you don't want an abortion, don't have one.  No, we're defending unborn.  If you don't want an abortion.  Hey, guys, anyone who's not an idiot, come over here.  Oh, on our side?  I know.  Yeah.  We got ten solid reasons.  Want to explain your position?  Yeah, I hate your face.  That's it?  Yeah, no, I'm not here to argue.  I'm just here to laugh at you.  You want to pray and act to end the sin of abortion.  And how are you going to do that?  by promoting a culture of purity, of chastity, by alerting the people to the errors and the harms of abortion.  People can have marital relations, right?  That's not an argument.  Insults are not arguments.  So do you have anything to say except vulgarisms?  No, just vulgarism.  Is this representative of this university?  Sure.  Hi, class of 05 and 09.  What gives you the right to stand here and tell somebody else what to do with their body?  That's a debate.  Is it your body?  It is my body.  Can you have two heads?  Yes, I can.  This is two heads.  I can walk with it.  I can walk this direction, that direction.  But can you have two heads?  No, the baby is a fetus.  Can you have two heads?  No.  What is your point of having two heads?  It's not your choice to kill it.  It is my choice.  Look.  It's my choice.  Yeah, you can.  You can choose to do that, but it's an immoral, it's an intrinsically wrong act.  I did.  It doesn't matter.  Why don't you say, Brady, end the sin of rape?  Because that's an intrinsically wrong thing to do.  Where's the sign?  So this is the problem, the abortion, not the rape, not the unplanned pregnancy.  I'm just saying, you're the one that's saying it.  Welcome.  It's been very interesting.  How's it going?  Good, yeah.  We've already had quite a lot of debates and angry people, so.  It didn't take them like three minutes, and I just went berserker.  So after this one follow-up pro-life replay, and he just looked at me in the spot right at my feet.  That's disgusting.  Just met the president of Students for Life and also one of the Students for Life workers, so.  Oh, wow.  So we're not alone.  Not alone, no.  I do know that life begins at conception.  How do you know that?  Because if you study embryology, life begins at conception.  Have you studied embryology?  I've studied enough to know.  What's your profession when you're not doing this?  My profession?  Yeah.  Do I need to be a doctor to know when life begins?  Yes.  Is every mother a doctor?  No.  then how do they know when life begins?  they can consult doctors but you said it's their choice.  it's their choice to avoid before a certain point.  yeah so that contradicts your argument that i need to be a doctor to know when life begins.  no i think that you know you're pretty brave for sharing your view and it's good to like be informed about another person's perspective.  How do you think hugs will help?  I just want to know.  We just want to support people today.  We're thinking about the women and girls on this campus who have had an abortion and have to walk past this.  And it's offensive, you think?  Because it's not an easy choice, you know?  Yeah, a choice to kill someone.  Making a new sign with crayons.  You're a bad guy.  I don't like you.  I'm not allowed to say that.  My right as a human being says I can make a judgment about your character.  You could judge me as a loud black woman.  That's okay.  I still think you're a bad guy.  Whatever.  Your judgments are allowed and I'm going to judge you for what you're doing right now.  Go ahead and judge me as a loud black woman because that's exactly what I'm fit to be.  I don't know what you're saying.  I don't know.  Just because it's different doesn't mean it's right to impose your way of being onto someone else.  Do you think there's an objective truth?  I think the one truth is that everyone's just being and that you can't control that.  If I woke up this morning and said, that flagpole to me today is a gingerbread house, would that make it a gingerbread house?  Yes or no?  perception is reality.  in your perspective it can be a gingerbread house.  that's the thing.  perception is reality.  if i say you're michelle obama does that make you michelle obama?  we've been debating for about two hours and the counter-protest seems to be really picking up.  so i think we're out of flyers.  that's how long we've been here.  i think we're out.  You were adopted from Russia?  I am, yeah.  Abortion is a huge issue there.  Under Soviet rule, women had an average of eight abortions in their lifetime.  The number has gone down, but it's still relatively much higher than most other places in the world.  So I will always be pro-life for that reason.  What do you think about the free hugs counter-protest out there?  I disagree, and I don't think shouting at people is going to help anyone.  But, you know, at the end of the day, they have the right to do this.  That's a ten!  And I'm about to raise my voice for as long as I need to.  Because this is the University of Michigan.  This is a public campus.  But is your screaming helping anyone?  It doesn't matter.  They're sitting here helping.  How could it not?  I'm going to scream.  It don't matter if it's helping you.  Maybe an intellectual conversation might do more in changing hearts and minds, though, than screaming.  Thank you.  Your shoes are bumping.  Why are you eating it if you disagree with it?  I don't understand.  What did she do?  I thought she spat.  I think it was a he, if I can assume his pronouns.  He asked for a flyer, so I gave it to him, and then he bent over and he started throwing up.  It's right there on the ground.  I am not going to film it.  That is disgusting.  We don't have to be tolerant of this!  You're a fucking terrorist.  Your religion doesn't exist anymore.  It's going to die out within 30 years, you fucking DJ.  Kill yourself.  She's getting an abortion.  She's getting an abortion.  What do you think about the pro-choice side?  Well, I mean, they're much more dignified.  It's not shouting.  We want God who is our King.  We want God our Father.  What are you guys called?  I'm just like genuinely curious.  TFP, Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property.  Yes, ma'am.  At this point, the counter-protests, they don't have anything else to say, and everybody else is just standing and watching.  A lot of people are taking the flyers, so I think we made a big difference today.  Okay, so this is the first of a lot of different pro-life campaigns we're going to be doing in Michigan.  So we'll keep you posted.  God bless.  God bless. ",
