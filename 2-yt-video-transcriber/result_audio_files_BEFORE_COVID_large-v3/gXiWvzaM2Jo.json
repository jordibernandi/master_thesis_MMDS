I think they actually found a president who was willing to work with people who really didn't even like him and didn't think he was probably going to accomplish much.  And it got almost no coverage.  We played it on our show, maybe a few other places, but it didn't get any coverage. ",

            "text": "What's your reaction to seeing that?  No, I think that that's a very important attempt to zero in on this vicious policy in the last 40 years of mass incarceration, punitive attitudes toward those engaged in various kinds of crimes.  I've been blessed to teach in prisons for 37 years, a raw way to step program.  I was just a Norfolk.  It's something that has an impact on the ground.  And I'd give the president credit for that.  It's not as if he has nothing to offer.  It's just that the dominant orientation is still tied to what I'm critical of with both parties.  Because identity politics for me is milquetoast neoliberal politics that don't talk about corporate power, don't talk about poverty, don't talk about militarism.  but the Republicans still strike me as so cold-hearted, mean-spirited, and they're still tied to corporate power and Wall Street and won't hit poverty head-on.  But when it comes to prison, when it comes to statistics, I give the president credit for that, but it's still small relative to what I'm looking for.  I see it in neither of both parties other than Brother Bernie Sanders, but that's another dialogue, as you know.  Bernie Sanders.  We won't go into that right now. ",

            "text": "I love that so much.  Listen, when you try to hit an honest actor with a got you moment, they're going to jujitsu you and leave you on the floor in pain because Cornel West, he's like, that's the thing.  Fox is so stuck in their partisan.  blood sports, that they don't realize that there are honest people out there who tell the truth.  And so they pose this to Dr.  Cornel West as if it's a gotcha.  And he's like, yeah, first step back, sure, that was good.  But that's quite literally just a first step.  And instead of throwing a party here, let's talk about... you know, the issue of mass incarceration, let's talk about corporate power, let's talk about Wall Street, let's talk about militarism, and let's talk about how, in the broader scheme of things, this is a knack to the real problems that need to be fixed.  But am I going to give credit for this?  Yeah, why wouldn't I?  It's not hard.  It's not hard.  When you're an honest actor, you can deal with it because you're just like, okay, I see what you're trying to do here.  Here, I'll give you what you want.  That was a good policy.  but you're missing the forest through the trees, here's why you're wrong on the broader point, and then you explain.  You can't beat that.  By the way, that entire interview, I recommend you go watch it.  Candace Owens is a talking point machine.  All she has is like, oh my god, the Democrats are so terrible, they want to breed dependency among the black community, and like, you know, welfare policies destroyed the black community, and... Donald Trump is a straight shooter and tells it like it is.  And Maxine Waters has a low IQ.  Like she is such a rank partisan actor who has taken a page out of Ben Shapiro's book of like talk fast and confidently and hope that that makes people go, oh, yes, you must know what she's talking about.  But really, her audience, just like all of Talking Points USA, that's the group she was a part of, I'm not sure if she's with them anymore, Charlie Kirk's group, but they all have boomers following them, as if they act like they have this giant young following.  It's mostly boomers.  It's Republicans who are older, who just want to hear people affirm their narrative, and that's what they get from people like Candace Owens.  So she's a Talking Point machine, and of course, Dr.  Cornel West is... just being honest and straightforward the entire time.  And you'll notice, even when he hits them with a waterfall of truth and, you know, honesty, what do they do?  She goes right back into the partisan tap dance.  So she goes, from this clip, right after this little clip you saw here, she goes, anyway, I want to go back to this thing about Obama.  Obama's supposed to be the great racial healer in this country, and it turns out he was the racial divider in this country.  Why is everything to you guys Democrat versus Republican, Democrat versus Republican, Democrat versus Republican?  And here's the thing.  So you gave Trump credit for the First Step Act, Laura Ingraham.  Other Fox hosts gave Trump credit for the First Step Act.  Go back and look at their reaction to when Obama, his second term, towards the end of his second term, you know what he started doing?  Pardoning and commuting sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.  You go back and you watch Fox News coverage of those instances, and you tell me what you see.  Very simply put, they were outraged.  about Obama pardoning non-violent drug offenders.  Now, the First Step Act, criminal justice reform, the whole idea is, hey, let's not be as punitive towards non-violent drug offenders, and all of a sudden they love it, and all of a sudden they're in favor of it.  See, that's the thing that irks me to no fucking end, man, is that they, like, Laura Ingraham doesn't actually believe anything.  Sean Hannity doesn't actually believe anything.  That's why there's that famous video with him talking about the NSA and the Patriot Act.  Under Bush, the NSA and the Patriot Act was, they're protecting the homeland.  How dare you not be in favor of these increased police measures.  Under Obama, oh my God, this exact same program I was just sucking off is actually really terrible and it violates your Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure.  He doesn't actually believe anything.  He has no core.  He has no real policy beliefs.  He's just playing... It's just playing a partisan game.  I'm going to play for Team Republican, and that's the end of it.  That's as deep as my thinking goes.  Laura Ingraham, same shit.  I'm playing for Team Trump, so isn't the First Step Act awesome?  But oh yeah, wasn't it terrible when Obama released nonviolent drug offenders and was doing the same thing?  that's at the core of the First Step Act?  It... She also says, by the way, oh, this didn't get coverage.  Didn't get coverage.  I've seen countless segments on the First Step Act.  And pretty much everybody on the left told the truth.  They were like, yeah, this is good, but it is just a first step.  So, like, straw lefty.  Beat that straw lefty all day long.  As if, like, nobody, why won't they give him credit for this?  Of course I'll give Trump credit when he does good things.  The problem is, he almost never does them.  Very, very rarely.  Less than 5% of the time will he do it.  Now again, I'll still give him credit when he does it.  I've done it before.  But I'm not going to be like you, where you are clearly just a rank partisan actor, playing for Team Trump, playing for Team Republican, and that's all you got.  It's tired.  It's boring.  It's stale.  It's banal.  It's not remotely interesting.  It's not remotely edgy.  It's not remotely brave.  It's really pathetic.  It's really pathetic.  And, of course, Dr.  Cornel West did a great job there because he's always going to tell the truth.  And there are times he's told the truth and he pissed off everybody.  Which is what makes him great.  Because he's not telling anybody what they want to hear.  He's not just playing partisan politics.  He's only interested in truth and justice.  And that's why he's wonderful.  And that's why he ran circles around your punk ass.  And I'm sure he'll do it again. ",
