This has happened even with the depiction of cities in the past.  And sometimes we really do have these islands that rise up like we've seen.  Some only sticking around for a few days before going back under the water.  And others just being brand new islands.  they show a different shot here saying that apparently when they were here it was as low as negative 25 degrees celsius but there was no sight or sound of any volcanic activity that would suggest that there was something bubbling up out of the earth.  what you're looking at right here they state is a mirage as real as it may look with all the features That you see right there.  They're saying this thing is a mirage.  So.  Wanted to make mention of it.  Sometimes you can say, okay, I can see that.  Other times you can say, okay, man, it really looks like there's something there.  Like, are you sure?  But in this instance, this is what they're saying.  If any of you guys out there got any crazy images like this, let me know.  Dabu7yahoo.com.  Would love to check them out.  Or hit me up on Twitter as well.  I'll leave links below.  Peace. ",
