Next to Shaman, Christ returned for a second time.  Game's over for you heathens, my spiritual power's like a trained soldier Ready for war like Samson till they all gone With nothing more than a jawbone.  But that's future prophecy, obviously, till then let's commit to the love Follow these laws, embrace each other with kisses and hugs.  Shalawans and Shalons in this modern day Rome Filled with degradation, children and fatherless homes.  But we the salt of the earth, these nations imitate us We innovators, shout out to Judah and Venezuela All the way to Korea, we the flavor, they see us.  It's crazy though, although they hate us, they still wanna be us Israel, not to confuse us with Ishmael Cause we the promise, they worship Muhammad all the while Thuggin', smugglin' across the border, that fits, Cal Callin' on your hour, you missed out, you ain't his child.

I'm forever reppin' Israel, Israel, Israel Yeah.  Oh!  Look, forever I'm reppin', reapin' the blessings.  900 degrees, no half steppin' These lyrical spirituals straight from the heavens Been ordained as a king, priest, F your reverend The day of the Lord be comin' nigh Revilers ain't gettin' wise, these babies is gettin' high.  The day's short and I know I'm lackin' time Cause America's truth was all a lie.  Babylon got a nigga depressed.  This part-time got me all the way stressed.  The church got you all the way in duress.  Spending your last check for a Sunday best.  While I'm on a quest, reaching success.  Refining perfection through day and night with no rest.  What the vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.  The Maccabees we getting on one accord.  A prophet put in the belly when I was born.  Keeping the balance, making a sure, settling scores.  Me and mine versus you and yours.  We were chosen as a special race, set apart till he gave us his will.  We got his name, our forever praise, and today we standin' face to face.  I'm forever reppin' his will.  We were chosen as a special race, set apart till he gave us his will.  Well, for that His name I'll forever praise Till the day we stand and face the face Of the resurrection. ",
