            "text": "So the other day, I was assaulted, and... It sounds like the next two Obama phone people are fighting with each other.  It's not done for whatever happened the other day.  I said whatever happened the other day, they can't arrest them for it.  They were trying to be protective.  Someone yelled, get a job.  It's a 50-40, 50-40 in the University.  I'm doing a female and her 40.  I get it.  Makes you feel bad about it.  Do you have any?  I definitely don't have any.  Well, in regards to whatever incident, does that have anything to do with the follow-up?  Follow-up?  Well, she had a... I don't get why my name is... Good.  He said, show me a lot of this because I have this good idea.  I'm still in between that seat right now.  Oh, and you got anything to tell me further?  So if I just say, hey, this guy, two weeks ago, he was over here and we did a table together.  I've never done it before.  I've never done it before.  I've never done it before.  I hire all these people.  I have nothing.  I didn't do anything to anybody.  Why, why, why?  Is she saying that I punched her in the face?  I thought I punched her in the face.  I thought I punched her in the face.  I thought I punched her in the face.  I understand why you didn't want it.  You didn't do anything.  I don't want you to do that to me.  You see, it did happen.  We can't, we can't listen.  We can't listen.  We'll be more independent.  We'll be more independent contractors.  Okay, I have an idea.  We're going to give you your information.  What is that good?  It's just that we voted once in a year.  They need to.  If you want to go forward, let's go forward.  I'm Sir Richard M. Skew.  I just want to let you guys know that I have pictures of him, but be sure to tell you it wasn't him.  I definitely have pictures of him.  I just want to let you guys know that I have pictures of him, I don't know.  I don't know.  Our job is to just write down your info and document it.  That's all we're trying to do.  We're not seeing anything.  It's just, if someone says something, crime happened the other day.  We'll investigate it.  That's all it is.  So, we were, I didn't know if it was involved, not involved in the invasion, but it was involved, and I think it might be in reference now.  I don't know.  I don't know.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  And then it clears it all up.  Did y'all go fight?  No, no, my baby, I don't fight.  I believe you guys.  Because you're the manager of Westwood.  We didn't say it.  We're just asking you to essentially clear your name.  And then when she calls you, when you come back over here next time, she calls because she's probably working on it.  Then we come back and we don't need to do it.  We go, oh, this guy is weird.  She's wrong.  This isn't the person who did it.  And it's over.  Your name.  Now you have a line.  I don't know.  I'm just saying I have one.  So you're saying that it's over.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't say anything.  Yeah, but I'm telling you, you don't have to get your ID.  But from there, we have to determine the next step that we're going to do.  And it's going to be based on her statements.  I'm going to call the detective.  He's going to provide me that guidance if they think that you're a suspect or not.  And I'm saying, give us that information.  We'll give that to you.  I just told him you don't have the ID.  But he's still convinced me to give him the ID so they can give it to the detective and get it over with.  They're calling for facial recognition.  So even if he refused to ID, they would still do it patiently.  They didn't hear one and chose one.  I don't believe that you are.  You know, I don't believe that you are.  I truly believe that you are.  Like I said, she's accusing you of a crime.  We can't just walk away.  She's saying that you beat her up.  You know what I mean?  She's saying that.  We weren't there.  I can't say one way or the other.  Oh, you just might be on your name.  They investigate it.  You go back to work.  Get out of here.  Camera guys, get out of here.  You're not on video anymore.  Here I come.  What we're going to do is, I'm just going to provide the colors that you're taking.  Green ball!  Green ball!  Let's have a game!  Here's my card and here's a number for a lawyer.  Just looking out for your safety, man.  Thank you.  Good job standing up for your rights, man.  Good job standing up for your rights, man.  A lot of people don't know.  Thank you. ",
