            "text": "I'm Messianic Rabbi Zeb Porat.  The people of Israel are rejoicing for seven days.  As believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we understand the prophetic meaning.  Leviticus chapter 23, verse 40 says that we are to rejoice for seven days.  It's pointing to the eternal tabernacle.  with Yeshua, with Jesus forever.  Revelation 21, 3.  Behold, the tabernacle of man is now with God forever.  Let's continue to stand together in prayer as the gospel goes forth here in Israel.  That all Jewish people in Israel and around the world and the nations come to know that Yeshua, Jesus, is the eternal tabernacle.  Yeshua is God.  We at Messiah of Israel Ministries would like to wish you and your family a happy feast of tabernacles.  In the mighty name of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Okay. ",
