            "text": "Good morning, happy Monday.  It is minus three degrees today.  Celsius.  So today is my first day writing for quite a while, quite a break away from it while I've been focusing on paying the bills and launching the Story Magic Academy and all those and lots of other things.  So it's a little bit intimidating, definitely, to come back to North of the End after quite a while away from it.  But I'm also kind of excited because I've been wanting to get back to this for a while and I'm really excited to get it finished.  I don't have a deadline as such because that's something that I figured out kind of last NaNoWriMo that I did is that you can't actually rush revision in the same way that you can drafting and I was trying to rush it and it was just not working and I was just making more work for myself further on down the line.  So I don't have a deadline, I just have this kind of deal I've made with myself that my first burst of work of the day, so I work in these 15 minute bursts.  at the moment, with 15 minute breaks, my first work session of the day is always on my novel.  And then the rest of the day, obviously I'd like to get more than that done, but there may be other things that come up.  So that's the plan.  I'm feeling a bit nauseous actually today, this morning.  I think it's just that me and Ross have been not getting up as early as this for quite a while now.  And yeah, I'm up earlier than normal and I immediately had like a bacon sandwich for breakfast.  So probably just eating a bit too early.  I'm feeling a little bit sick, but I'm hoping that a combination of some water on my journey into the studio and maybe some fresh air is going to help.  Like I said, it's minus three degrees today, so I think the studio is going to be really cold.  The heating isn't great in there, so I'm wearing a nice thick jumper.  I'm wearing double socks because my feet get really, really cold.  I have really bad circulation.  I'm gonna take my gloves, my scarf, maybe I'll wear a hat and I've also got a hot water bottle with me and Ross also suggested that I go and buy some like thermal socks and a hoodie because I don't own a hoodie anymore and that's like a super cozy thing maybe something with those gloves.  so we're thinking about how to keep warm and because yeah this it's like late November And it's already gotten super cold.  November to me is still autumn.  December is like the first month of winter.  So I'm like, oh, winter's come early.  But I realise that not everyone kind of quantifies the seasons in that way.  So yeah, so that's the plan for today.  I'm going to start out with a burst of writing.  I've got a bunch of other things in my journal that I'd like to get done and we'll see how much more writing I can get done as well as those things and kind of just start to get back into the rhythm of working on North of the End on this revision.  Wish me luck and let's see how the day goes.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Cause I know it's gonna be nice.  I'm impressioning.  Girl, I'm gonna let some get out.  Hey, I found a little girl.  What's the world I've been waiting for?  Yes, I know she can go.  And I'll take her for the winter.  Good evening.  I have arrived home.  I'm making some dinner.  It's a kind of fajita chicken stir-fry thing and some rice, which is bubbling away there in the background.  All in all, I think, pretty good day.  Yeah, I'm now going to chill out and have some food.  I'm very, very hungry and take it easy.  And back to work tomorrow.  Good night.  So I basically, yeah, so I did like writing for basically a whole morning.  Yeah, basically re-acquainting myself, read over the last chapter that I revised, but I basically had a bunch of, I had the like kind of thematic changes that I'd started kind of figuring out how to make one.  that was like the last thing I was working on.  So I basically started getting to that as well, like figuring out like okay well how do I need to change these plot embryos?  and then I'll be translating that into the outline and then going back to actual like word for word.  Yeah it was good.  and then basically like editing the last vlog I had to do. ",
