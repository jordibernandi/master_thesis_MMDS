            "text": "Good morning y'all.  Hope y'all are having a great Sunday morning.  I wanted to hop on here real quick.  I came up to Dunkin Donuts to grab some donuts for the kids and a coffee for myself.  I need to wake up.  But I had a moment.  to just get by myself and talk to you guys for a second.  So I wanted to share some thoughts with y'all and some encouragement as we go into Monday.  So a lot of you guys are new to my channel and may have not went back and watched my previous videos.  So I wanted to talk to you guys for a moment.  Those of you who are new and the people who are not new, who have been around since I started this channel, you know, I often about and I pray you know like why why am I doing like an end times ministry?  you know why why?  why?  you know why it could have been anything else.  you know what landed me here and it really just clicked.  because.  so those of you that don't know i had my very first dream from the lord and it was funny because me and um uh a couple of sisters in christ um uh lily girl and uh saved by grace.  we were talking the other um day and she was like.  you know you know um we each of us have different gifts from the lord and um I'm very open with you guys.  Um, I was, uh, physically, um, filled with the Holy ghost whenever I was young, but I didn't receive the gift of tongues.  And that's something that I've always wanted, but I haven't received yet.  But she was encouraging me saying, you know, that, uh, the Lord gives us different things for different reasons.  And I mean, one of mine has always been, uh, dreams and, you know when it is from the lord.  um at least i know when they're from the lord because my very first dream that i ever had from the lord was when i was 10 and it was a rapture dream and it was Quite amazing because that was around the time that I had been physically filled with the Holy Spirit.  But I didn't know what the rapture was.  I had no idea.  I was just a kid.  I've just heard things here and there, but nothing about the rapture, obviously, because I was young and I was a baby in Christ.  I was a baby in general.  and I had my very first rapture dream and I'll never forget it.  I'm 29 years old now so it's been a very long time but boy has that been just the most amazing thing that's ever happened in my life.  and what happened was in the dream and I'll explain again for those of you who have not heard it we were standing in a field in a big open field with a tree line out towards the front, and there was a bunch of us, a bunch of random people, just all of us standing out in a field.  And all of a sudden, now there's not a whole, whole lot to this stream, but it's very significant.  We were all standing out in this field, and all of a sudden, we started to spiral up into the air.  We started to spiral up, spiral up, spiral up, spiral up.  We got to a halfway, midway point, and we all stopped in midair.  And we started to spiral back down, spiral back down, spiral back down, spiral back down.  And we got back down to the grass, our feet laid back down to the grass, and I remember.  This is what I remember.  I remember turning back around.  Going back to wherever we came from.  And I remember there was somebody.  I always forget.  Somebody to the left or my right.  But there was somebody.  I'll just say to my right.  Somebody to my right.  Yeah.  And we were walking back to wherever we were coming from.  And I looked to that person.  And I said this with a knowing in my heart.  I looked at that person and I said... I'll never forget it.  I said that is a sign from God that it's almost time to go home.  That it's almost time to go home.  We got to that midway point.  he let us back down.  but I knew I looked over at that person and I knew I had an understanding without a doubt.  I said that is a sign from God that it's almost time to go home.  and so I was thinking about that this morning.  and you know I had no idea that God was going to bless me with this.  you know with this YouTube ministry I'd always had this longing to tell people about God And I would do it any opportunity that I would get.  Like I remember being on seesaws at like daycare telling people about Christ, you know, and write things down.  Uh, I would write how to become saved on a piece of paper and I would hand them out to people at the end of the driveway.  Like I was always evangelizing and I didn't realize it.  And I realized now that God had a very big plan for my life and I feel like that has a lot to do with this YouTube ministry.  And, And I feel like he has raised me and everyone else for a time like this.  I truly feel like we're the generation.  And I feel, y'all I'm a little dyslexic this morning.  I truly feel like we are the generation that is gonna see his return.  And he was telling me when I was younger, you know, it's almost time, we're at that midway point.  And of course I'm not gonna do math, you know, 10 plus 10, 20, I mean I'm 29 years old now.  but, Why on earth would he give a 10 year old a dream like that?  Not knowing.  I mean, I didn't even tell my mom I had a rapture dream because I didn't even know what the word rapture was.  I just described to her what happened and, and, uh, I don't think he would give me a significant dream like that as a 10 year old if I was just going to grow up and become an old woman and die and years and years and years ago down the road guys.  That dream was very significant and it was very real and it was from him.  so people like to get on here and mock us and scoff us and say that these we come up with these dreams in our head.  you know i i haven't been on youtube that long but i have been given dreams from the lord and especially that one.  when i was 10 he was telling me something and i truly feel like we are the generation that's going to see his return And so I want you guys to be encouraged, and I want you guys to start getting excited.  And what I would like to see everyone do as Monday rolls around is plan today.  What are you going to do this week to spread the gospel?  you know I whatever you decide that you want to do figure out a plan and follow through with it this week and make sure that you spread the gospel that you tell someone about Christ.  decide what you're going to do and do it because Time is so, so, so short.  And I know it because I was told when I was a little girl.  So, um... And I've had multiple dreams from him.  I don't get them every day.  I was actually praying for one last night.  But I realized he gives them to me in his timing for a reason.  And there's a lot of times I pray and I don't get them.  I mean, I've only had six total, you know.  And that's including the one when I was ten.  So, um... But he gave me hope about, I think it was about six months ago.  Yeah, well, four, five months ago is when I started my YouTube channel.  It was actually the very first YouTube video that I had ever posted on this channel.  And I had actually just woken up from a rapture dream, but the significance behind that was... This was around the time that I was watching, or that I had just started my YouTube channel and I was watching certain people and I said, you know, it really seems like, Lord, that you are coming soon.  And I know that you're going to come soon because you told me when I was a kid.  But I want my own confirmation and I want my own understanding and I don't want to lean on anything else.  You know, and I just, it had been so long and I just needed something else.  So... i was at work and i decided to take a break and i went down into the women's restroom and i went into the big stall and i closed my eyes and i just prayed and i said god if you're coming soon soon soon.  i remember.  this is what i said to him if you're coming soon soon i don't mean years down the road.  if you're coming soon soon imminently please just give me something.  something lord.  please just show me something you know to give me the time of the day because I don't think you're gonna give anybody that.  but please just give me something.  and and I said thank you and I went about my day and that was on a Friday and I woke up Saturday morning and I heard my son on the monitor.  he's almost two and I heard him on the monitor.  he usually wakes up around 637 o'clock.  So I woke up and I realized that he had fell back asleep.  So I went back to sleep and all of a sudden I had, I say it was like an out of body experience, but it felt so real because the setting in the dream was where I actually was laying.  And I was being raptured out of my bed, me and my husband.  So right where I had actually fell back asleep, where me and my husband were sleeping, we were being raptured out of the bed.  And it felt so real.  And I woke up and I said, I said, babe, I said, we were being raptured.  And he was like, you know, waking up out of his, he's like, what, what?  I was like, you know.  And not actually, but I just had a rapture dream and I knew within my heart, I knew within my soul, I knew within my soul, I knew within my soul that that was my confirmation.  And that was the very first video I had ever uploaded on YouTube.  And so I want you guys to be encouraged because I know He is at the door.  He is coming.  We are the generation.  He has raised us up for this time.  And so we have such an important job to spread the gospel, to get it out there.  because he's coming.  So I love you guys.  I want you to be encouraged.  Don't listen to these mockers and these scoffers because they're going to have to answer for that.  They are going to have to answer for that.  You keep doing what you're doing.  You keep spreading the gospel.  You keep giving these people what you get from the Lord because it's so important.  So I love you guys and I'll talk to you later. ",
