            "text": "Hello, hello!  Today we're going to be talking about plastic straws.  Here are the points we're going to hit today.  1.  Plastic straws are medical equipment.  2.  Currently available alternatives to plastic straws do not suit all needs or all disabilities.  3.  Creating legislation around straws is dangerous.  Four, the campaigns against plastic straws have actually created a stigma for disabled people and thus made them targets for harassment.  And five, environmentalism doesn't have to be ableist.  I'm hoping that by now you may have heard that plastic straw bans would have a harmful impact on disabled people.  But if not, or if you're looking for more information, I hope that I can answer some of the questions you might have or offer you ways to move forward from here in this video.  Part one, plastic straws are medical equipment.  A brief history of straws.  Plastic bending straws were created to be more accessible than previous existing versions and are used as accessibility devices to this day.  In the 1930s, Joseph Friedman created the flex straw, a bending straw inspired by watching his young daughter struggle with a milkshake glass and a straight straw.  In the 1940s, they were marketed to hospitals and were quickly embraced as they allowed patients to drink while lying down and without necessarily having to hold their own cup if they weren't able to.  Plastic bendable straws are medical accessibility tools for people with various disabilities.  It's actually quite a list, so I'm going to read them off.  People who have difficulty gripping or holding their cups for more than a moment, people with physical disabilities such as chronic pain in their skin, bones, joints, and muscles, fragile tissues, conditions that require ingesting food as fluid, like gastrointestinal conditions, conditions of the mouth, jaw, or teeth, difficulty swallowing or chewing, postural conditions, people who have tremors or shake, and so on.  They need straws in order to independently feed themselves or drink.  I have some personal examples in my life of people who sometimes cannot lift a heavy glass.  includes myself, because I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and I have chronic joint and muscle pain, oftentimes it is very difficult or very painful for me to hold a cup.  So in those moments, I do need a straw to drink, as well as having jaw issues and teeth sensitivity on top of that.  And I also have a personal friend who very often has fainting spells and needs to stay in a reclining position, but also needs to stay hydrated at the same time.  So, She needs a cup of water next to her with a straw that can bend down into a position downward toward her so she can continue to hydrate while in the reclining position.  Plastic bending straws made their way into general use after it was determined that it was a huge improvement on the paper straw that came before them and became a mainstream market success.  Part two, why alternatives do not work.  We like charts here, don't we?  Let's pull up a chart.  Hard straws like metal, glass, and bamboo are injury risks.  Bamboo, pasta, rice, silicone, and acrylic straws are allergy risks.  Biodegradable plastic straws are often made with plant products, particularly wheat, which are a very common allergy.  and they are actually not even that great for the environment.  Paper straws disintegrate rapidly, become non-functional, and are a choking hazard.  And literally, I have yet to meet a single person that actually likes them.  Why did we go back in time for these things?  All these risks have the potential to be fatal.  Reusable straws in general require diligent cleaning in order to avoid bacteria buildup and consequential infections and illness.  The physical act of cleaning a straw can be difficult to impossible for certain disabled people.  And no, they do not necessarily have anyone around to help them with that.  Many reusable straws are not necessarily safe in all temperatures and they are not adjustable in their positioning.  Reusable straws also require the cognitive ability to be able to remember them when going out.  But someone not having a straw on their person when out at a restaurant shouldn't mean they can't be a patron.  Does that happen when people forget their reusable coffee mugs at home?  Also, you might be thinking to yourself that many of these reasons imply multiple disabilities at once.  And how often could that possibly happen?  Well, A lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, including myself.  Plenty of people do not just have one disability.  Plenty of illnesses and conditions actually impact multiple parts of the body.  Plastic disposable bending straws are the most accessible due to their sterilization, their adjustable positioning, durability, and safety, particularly in regards to temperature and being low risk of injury upon pressure, which can easily happen with physical behaviors such as chewing, fidgeting, spontaneous jaw closures, and fall risks.  Part three, creating legislation around plastic straws is dangerous.  Across the country, plastic straws are a recurring topic, with cities like Seattle and Santa Barbara putting a legal ban on the use of plastic straws.  Santa Barbara being the most severe ban in the country at the moment with threats of thousand dollar fines and jail time.  While plastic straws are a medical need, Legal bans are unconscionable.  Restrictions can be just as dangerous because it puts the power to deny a medical tool in the hands of someone who's ill-equipped to make that kind of decision.  There have already been several situations where disabled people have been put in danger or killed because of these bans on plastic straws.  From someone who was given a biodegradable plastic straw at a restaurant and not being told that's what it was and then going into an anaphylactic attack because of it.  To a woman who was impaled and killed by a metal straw after a fall.  Part four, we have made a moral detriment out of using plastic straws?  The villainization of plastic straws have created a new stigma for disabled people.  Now, when they are seen using plastic straws, they are shamed.  When they request one, they are guilt-tripped.  A reminder, disabilities won't always be visibly apparent to you.  Doesn't mean they're not disabled.  So even if we do roll back these bans, it feels like we're gonna have an awfully slow and gruesome time rolling back these elitist and ableist attitudes, pointing the finger at people who use plastic straws, and calling them... turtle killers.  These bans and all the hullabaloo around them have created a prejudice And I think we all know how difficult those are to undo.  Plastic straws should be available.  If you don't need one, don't use one.  But if you do need one, you should not be shamed for it or risk being denied one.  Part five, environmentalism doesn't have to be ableist.  First, I want to clarify that environmentalists and disabled people are not mutually exclusive.  A lot of disabled people actually do try and live as environmentally friendly as they possibly can.  But the truth is, a lot of resources that disabled people need in order to survive or for accessibility require non-renewable resources to maintain.  A lot of them already feel guilt about that.  but they have a right as human beings to survival and accessibility.  This is not the first time that disabled people get thrown under the bus as wasteful.  In fact, in my two previous videos, I talk about how outrage towards things that are deemed wasteful or lazy have had a negative impact on disabled people including outrage about pre-cut fruits and vegetables that would greatly help disabled people feed themselves more independently and feed themselves good healthy food independently but because of the outrage were taken off the shelves in supermarkets.  our ability to access the same independence as you is not a waste.  These kind of outrage campaigns making tremendous headway and rapidly at that is what happens in a system where abled voices hold the mic and disabled voices are erased.  For peace of mind and for information's sake, let's talk very briefly about the environmental impact of plastic straws.  as researched by scientists.  Out of the 35 million tons of plastic waste per year, plastic straws only account for 4% of all plastic waste.  What do you call a 4% discount?  Nothing.  And it would be even less if its use was simply reduced.  by abled people who don't need it.  It's really truly nothing.  Especially when comparing them to much larger environmental impacts like cigarettes and fishing nets and balloons and fireworks.  None of which, to my knowledge, have been campaigned or campaigned as hard as plastic straws.  to have their sale and purchase legally banned.  In comparison, the alternatives that have been created for plastic straws might in fact be creating more waste.  Yes, we should be reducing our use of plastic as a whole.  We should be reducing our use of unnecessary plastics.  We should be recycling more.  We should be finding alternatives when we can.  But if we're going to put the responsibility on the individual consumer, then put it on them to deny a straw or reduce when able.  Disabled people would love an earth-friendly alternative to the sterile, disposable, adjustable straw that is able to endure so much and safe to use and is made available to everyone, but it doesn't exist yet.  And in the meantime, we simply cannot do an outright ban on plastic straws without harming disabled people.  The production of plastic straws is a medical one.  And until a suitable replacement is found, people medically rely on them.  Single-use plastics are often medical for the reasons that I've already mentioned.  The production of plastic straws is just as valid as plastic gloves, catheters, stoma bags, IV bags, etc.  Just because you may have never considered them as medical or accessible devices doesn't mean that that's not how they are used by disabled people every single day.  In conclusion, we can do what's right for the environment and we do not have to sacrifice the medical needs of others.  We do not have to shame people for having those needs.  We do not have to tell them that their survival, their physical needs are harming the environment, particularly when the onus should not be on them.  We do not have to tell them Too bad, something else will probably come along.  In the meantime, let's deny you your access needs.  If we're going to save the world, we better make sure that it's a world worth living in.
