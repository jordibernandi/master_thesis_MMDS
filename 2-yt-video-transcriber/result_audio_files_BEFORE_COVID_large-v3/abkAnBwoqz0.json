            "text": "So what you just saw was Donald Cherry last night on the CBC on Coach's Corner Hockey Night in Canada suggesting that quote unquote.  you people, the people who come here for the milk and honey of Canada don't respect the sacrifices of the veterans that made this Canada what it is today.  And he also seemed to imply that people in the quote-unquote small cities really liked the poppy and wore it.  And I think what he's trying to suggest is that small city Canadians, rural Canadians, the people outside the big cities, predominantly white, respect and honor the poppy and its meaning, and that the rest of the people, the you people, the people who come here, aka immigrants, They come here for the benefits of Canada and they don't respect the sacrifices it took to make this Canada.  This view is unacceptable.  This is Don Cherry on the public broadcaster basically suggesting that some people overwhelmingly racialized do not respect what it took to build this country through the sacrifices of those overwhelmingly white Canadians.  basically saying that you new people, you overwhelmingly racialized people, are ungrateful for the sacrifices of European Canadians to make this country what it is.  That's what Donald Cherry is saying.  And this isn't new.  Don Cherry has long held this view.  He said on Coach's Corner at other times that, you know, Anglo-white Canadians from smaller cities are overwhelmingly the people who make military service and sacrifice, implying that if you're not one of those things, if you're, you know, racialized, or if you're from the quote-unquote big city, then you don't actually make the sacrifices.  that makes you less of a real Canadian to those other Canadians.  That they are the real, true, blue, good Southern Ontario boys, or good old boys from Saskatchewan.  And you, from Brampton, you don't really count as a real Canadian.  At least not as real as them.  That's effectively what Donald Cherry has long said on the CBC.  He needs to at the very least apologize for this.  I think this is a fireable offense.  Don Cherry basically went coast to coast in Canada to millions of homes and injected a jingoistic, xenophobic, right-wing nationalism into the airwaves without any criticism, without any challenge, without any correction from anyone.  He was allowed to say that unquestioned.  unacceptable from the CBC, and unacceptable from Don Cherry.  And let's be 100% real here.  This is tapping into some ugly stuff.  This taps into the same narratives used by Faith Goldie and Maxime Bernier, who have talked about how modern immigrants are cultural leeches.  They want to destroy our country.  They want to take away its white European heritage and implant, whether it's Islam or whether it's non-white, non-European heritages.  They want to destroy the Canada we know and love and the Canada that existed in the past.  They come here for our social services and they want to do nothing to stand up for Canadian values and Canadian identity.  So these people talk about limiting immigration or by targeting it to ideal groups that respect Canadian values, quote unquote.  And Don Cherry isn't saying that here.  But what he's tapping into is that same energy, that same right wing, jingoistic, xenophobic nationalism that Faith Goldie and Maxime Bernier have been using for years now.  Further to all of this, the biggest thing is that at the end of the day, these people who come here, the quote-unquote you people Don Cherry talks about, want to be Canadians way more than most of us.  Most of us, myself included, Don Cherry included, so many of us, are Canadians of coincidence.  We were born here.  We didn't earn our spot.  We didn't do anything to get it.  The people who immigrate here, historically and today, made immense sacrifices.  They gave up ways of life, communities, families.  families, friends, all the sorts of things that, you know, you hold really dear.  In some cases, they gave up opportunities at home to come here for hopefully better opportunities, but there are no guarantees.  They came here.  They were treated with racism.  They were treated with cultural xenophobia.  They were treated with discrimination.  They were often paid low wages.  They were forced to take menial work, difficult work, dangerous work, under the table work.  This applied to white, but especially non-white Canadian immigrants.  And yet they came because they wanted to be Canadian, because they love the idea of Canada, because they wanted to be one of us.  They wanted to be Canada.  They chose that.  So to suggest that they're ungrateful or that they're not as real a Canadian as the small city folk who wear the poppy is bullshit. ",
