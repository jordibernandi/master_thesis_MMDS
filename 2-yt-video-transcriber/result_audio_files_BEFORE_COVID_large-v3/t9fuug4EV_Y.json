Is it required by law?  No, but I'm required to ask for it, sir.  If you're just telling me you don't want to give it to me, that's fine.  Yeah, I don't want to give it to you.  Okay, how about a number that we can reach you at?  Uh, no, thanks.  Okay, the door behind you that says emergency entrance, do you see that door?  Yes.  Hello, sir, do you see that door?  With the after hours entry?  Yes, I'm going to go ahead.  Perfect.  It's not like I haven't already announced my presence here by getting buzzed in.  They got two minutes to come out.  And then we're shouting plates.  All right.  They were warned.  You know what?  They've got to do it.  They can't help themselves.  It's Saturday.  There's nobody here.  They cannot help themselves.  They cannot.  They have to.  They must.  So 15 minutes waiting in a lobby after being buzzed in Did I not get service?  because I didn't sit down?  Because I didn't obey?  Just obey.

No, you just came from inside.  I saw you.  Okay.  Uh, so what do you need?  Do you need some paperwork?  What's your name?  My name's Officer Thunder.  You guys are f***ing useless.  Okay, that's your opinion.  Shared by millions.  Okay, that's your opinion, man.  Shared by millions.  Do you need something?  Go into the front desk and they'll help you.  Yeah, no, they didn't.  I was in there for 15 minutes already.  What you did or what you said or why you left, but they're... Did they ask an officer?  Yeah, how do you think I got inside?  You're not very smart, are you?  How do you think I got inside the lobby?  You think somebody buzzed me in?  You're not very smart.  You're not very smart.  You should keep riding your bike.  You should keep moving along.  You should keep moving along.  Hey, are citizens allowed to walk on sidewalks here in the city of Carlsbad?  That's a yes or no question.  That's a yes or a no question, Clement.  Okay.  Clement, that's a yes or a no, Clement.  Clement, that's a yes or a no question, Clement.  Are citizens allowed... Uh-oh, they got the canine.  Look out, it's on now, kids.  It's on now.  I already told you.  Okay, I don't do any reforms.  So I don't have any access to any forms that you say you may need.  So my question that you've successfully evaded thus far is, are citizens allowed to walk up and down the sidewalk in the city of Carlsbad?  Walking up and down.  There's your answer.  Okay.  How many snowflakes are on the force here that don't allow people to walk on a sidewalk?  If you needed anything from the inside department, go inside the department and talk to the locksmith.  No, I was in there already, bro.  You already denied service, so... I can't help you.  Well, exactly.  So, like I said, move along.  Like I said, when you first rolled up, I said keep moving.  But you felt the need to stop and make more of an idiot of yourself.  Yeah, that's right.  Keep going.  I appreciate your comments.  No, you don't appreciate your comments.  I'm antagonizing everybody?  Well, hey, listen, I would say the same thing about somebody walking up and down the street with the chief of police following them.  I have no idea what that happened.  You have no idea of the incident on July 29th that I'm talking about, the guy that had what appeared to look like a gun on his shoulder?  You see me there?  You are such an idiot.  You are trying to tell me that you do not know about this incident.  Clement, you're a fucking liar.  You are a fucking liar.  You're a fucking liar, Clement.  Clement, you don't know.

A, B, buzz me in.  C, tell me there's going to be service.  And then D, deny me service.  for a solid 15 minutes.  Hi, I was the guy that was in the lobby for 15 minutes with no service.  Is that normal procedure for the Carlsbad Police Department?  Actually, I saw several officers leave the station since I've been inside here on motorcycles.  So how do you explain that?  That was a question.  I didn't hear you.  I saw several officers leave here since I was already inside here that were on site.  So are you trying to tell me that they weren't?  So how long do you think it's going to take?  Is there a watch commander present?  We can't get an EPA because we can't control emergencies in our city.  I know you can't control emergencies on your city.  I witnessed one live on YouTube.  Do you want to get buzzed back in or kind of hang up?  I have 911 calls.  Well, buzz me back.  Is somebody going to see me?  is my question.  Do you have a first and last name?  I'm not giving you my first and last name.  I guarantee you there's 10 cops in the back.  I should light off some fireworks inside the police lobby to find out how many there are here.  Chances are we're going to fire real quick.  Great.  Is there any reason why you guys took 20 minutes to serve the public?  Okay, what's your name?  What's your name, sir?  I asked you for your name.  Cobanda?  Okay, was it that difficult?  Wow.  Okay.  Cobanda.  Sergeant.  See, it wasn't that difficult.  And maybe it took... 300 phone calls to the Carlsbad Police Department.  Yeah.  You know what?  Listen, here's the deal.  I'm no PR expert.  However, if there was a viral video of our cops looking like dicks, regardless of whether or not your opinion as a cop saying that, oh, they were in the right, okay?  But if thousands of people called from all over the world, I would say that you may, may being the operative term, you may want to try to counter that even if it's ever so slightly.  i guarantee you that sergeant is such a lazy that he doesn't even leave the station.  unless there's like critical injury or a death he sends everybody else out.  he doesn't want to leave.  he just sits around the station man playing mahjong on his windows 98 pc.
