            "text": "So this right here is the Bank of America Tower.  I'm in Midtown Manhattan.  And the reason I'm filming the Bank of America Tower is because I once had a conversation with a white billionaire.  And he's kind of a libertarian, and so he wasn't into conservative or Republican.  When we talked about the Democrats and Republicans, his opinion was that they all kind of care about their own power.  They all rip the American people off.  When we talked about Facebook, he said, oh, Facebook is evil.  And I've known Mark Zuckerberg since he was young, and that's an evil company.  So he's kind of wired in like that in terms of some of the stuff that's going on in the country on a high level because he's, you know, a billionaire or whatever.  Well, anyway, one thing that he mentioned was he had followed my work with the black community.  One thing that he said he liked about what we do is that he said, your ideology, I like it because it's not liberal, it's not conservative, it's all about power.  And he said, power means that when you go and you run up the mountain shooting, they're going to shoot back.  If you get real power, he said, as black people get real power... don't expect that people are going to let you accumulate power without them fighting back.  and he said and i like the fact that you fight back.  so i bring all that up to say that one example he brought up in terms of a power play by a community was bank of america.  and he said a lot of people don't really know that bank of america was a power play by the italian community to get power in america.  and then a lot of people don't even know bank of america was founded by individuals from the Italian community and they call it Bank of America so you won't even know that it's Italian owned.  So he said that was a power move that they did to aggregate their economics.  and he said basically to do what you're talking to black people about doing now, that's what they did to build Bank of America.  So I do that showing you the Bank of America tower because I just thought that this was something, you know, the one way for us to build empires in our community is to understand the structure and the foundation of other people's empires.  so that we'll get some ideas on how to build our own.  So that's it.  I'm out of here.  Hit the thumbs up button.  I'll see you guys soon.  Peace. ",
