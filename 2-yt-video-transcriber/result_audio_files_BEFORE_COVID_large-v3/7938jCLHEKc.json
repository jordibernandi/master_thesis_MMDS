First and foremost, I want to say thanks to our host, Steve, for putting us up down here.  It's a nice little spot on the beach.  Thank you, Steve.  We'll be out here for a couple of days, doing some videoing, and relaxing, of course, as well.  I want to thank my cousin, Gia, for putting me up.  Thanks, Gia.  Woo-hoo!  Hey, how do we get in?  Right here.  Okay.  Thanks.  After you, sir.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Can I sit with you?  No.  Okay.  Excuse me.  Hi.  Hi.  No, can I help you?  No, just be quiet.

I'm sorry, the second floor is open to the public, right?  No, you have to pass for six.  Oh, that's for the third floor and up.  The second floor is open to the public.  Well, I don't want to break any laws.  You're allowed to be in the main lobby area.  Okay.  So I can't go upstairs?  None of it's restricted access, no.  Okay.  I have official business.  Denied of service.  Documented by, what's your name, sir?  Detective Young.  Detective Young?  Do you have a badge number, sir?  570.  570?  Yeah.  What's your name?  That's a salty number.  Just call me good citizen, sir.  Yeah, according to the lady that just went up, the second floor is accessible to the public.  Yes.  But it just became inaccessible today?  No, you have to have a badge, anything above the second floor.  Okay, what kind of badge?  Just give me your driver's license and I'll make one.  Well, I don't want to do that.  Okay.  Then you don't belong.  Yeah, well, that's denial of service.  No.  Yeah, it is.  Wow, hold on a second.  Here we go.  Name and badge number, please.  How you doing?  Fantastic.  What was that you needed?  Name and badge number.  Officer Murdock, 1063.  And yours?  Officer Perez, badge number 1149.  All right, thanks.  All these guys for two cameras.  Signal 13, is that what they said?  What's that?  Did they call Signal 13?  Just here to back up an officer, man.  Where's the officer that needs backup?  Is that you, sir?  Here, sir.  Clamming up.  We have cameras.  We have no ill will, no ill intent.  All right, but there are four armed men here watching me very vigilantly, like you want to put me on the ground and tase me or throw me in a cage.  All right.  You guys swore an oath, right?  To defend the Constitution?  Sir?  Sir?  Did you, Detective, swear an oath?  So now you don't want to talk.  How about you?  No?  Taking his lead?  The Constitution of the United States has a thing called the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments.  And I'm not a sovereign citizen, so don't paint me with that picture.  I'm not one of those guys.  I follow the law.  And I swore that oath, too.  That's why I'm talking to you guys.  I'm not continuing my tour here because you guys are surrounding me with guns, for a constitutionally protected activity.  Are you really taking off, Detective, or are you just walking away rudely from the conversation?  I'm not having a conversation.  Okay.  You're just here to babysit me?  Think about me tonight, sir.  This is what I did, honey.  I kept the city hall safe from those cameras.  Oh, bro.  They didn't teach you Spanish?  I'm sorry.  I just assumed because of the last name.  That's all right.  What's going on anyway?  I just said drop that badge.  Find another job, bro.  What's going on anyway?  What happened?  Nothing.  I don't know.  We didn't call you.  Somebody else called.  Oh, okay.  You could see what we're doing.  Oh my gosh.  Are you guys here for us too?  No answer?  Kenny?  Have a good day, gentlemen.  You too, brother.  Right?  Detective.  We'll find out why you don't like the cameras, Detective.  We'll find out where you're hiding.  Alright gentlemen, be safe.  You too.  Don't let them corrupt you, bro.  And they're dismissed.  But he's still here.  What else on the second floor, sir?  Planning and zoning.  Community development.  Marketing.  If I had a question for Planning and Zoling, can you relay it to them?  Well, I'll give you their number.  How about that?  No.  Hmm.  Why?  I said it's okay.  Oh, okay.  You guys got to update these signs.  L.A.?  Your partner in there was giving a directive that floors 2 through 5 require card access.  That's not true, is it?  He said, by the way, that means anyone going up the lobby will get a business badge.  Oh, okay.  Even to make an anonymous statement to an elected official?  I'm sorry?  Even to make an anonymous statement to an elected official, we still have to surrender our Fourth Amendment right?  Well, I don't know much about that.  How about you?  Do you know the answer to that?  I believe I need to be a volunteer.  best, right?  Well, no.  I believe I need to just conduct my business without giving up my Fourth Amendment right.  Is there an elected official here right now?  I'm sorry?  Did you make an appointment with an elected official?  No, I didn't.  Okay.  It's an audit.  Therefore, it would defeat the purpose.  Okay.  Which kind of you guys are doing to me now?  I'm not doing anything.  You can do whatever you want.  I'm not talking to you.  No, you guys stopped me from going upstairs.  Because you need car access to get up there.  To the third and fifth floor.  Third to fifth floor.  That's what it says there.  And that's what somebody else, an employee, confirmed to me.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  After you guys called me out of the elevator, yeah.  That became the policy at that moment.  I'm not exactly sure of the policy.  Right.  I don't work in this building.  But, hey, if you'd like to go to the second floor access and they're granting you access to go to the second floor, deal with that.  Well, I was going to the second floor, and I don't think I need access because it's not clearly marked.  All I need is to make a public records request to the finance department.  I'm allowed to do that anonymously per Florida Statute 119.  So if I can't get somebody down here from finance, and if I can't go up to you, is this how I deal with my Fourth Amendment right?  I'm Fin.  I just heard record requests.  Yes, that's what we want to do, and they're not allowing us to do it anonymously, which is against 119.  Oh, it is?  Well, do you want me to help you?  Yes, that would be fantastic.  You are making this place look really good.  Yeah, but I don't like my face on there or whatever.  But yeah, would you just let me put the... Please take your time.  I'll be right with you.  No, edit that part out.  Don't worry.  I'm a human being.  Okay.  But anyway, I'll be right with you.  What's your name again?  Finn.  Finn?  F-A-N-N?  No, just one N. Oh, cool.  All right.  Give me two minutes.  Take your time.  She wants to help.  She's the city clerk, and she's going to help.  Okay, well, then she'll know.  Yeah, she agreed.  If not, it could cost the city tens of thousands of dollars in suits.  Well, I'm just glad you're going to be with me.  No, and police officers don't have qualified immunity in that case either.  That means you, sir.  If they're asking you to enforce a false policy with your gun, we go after your jet ski and your boat and your pension.  Have I enforced anything yet?  No, but you did get me off that elevator.  Only due to their policy.  It's okay.  You're safe.  Wow, another one.  Hi, may I have your name and badge number, please?  My what?  Name and badge number, please.  My name and badge number. ",
