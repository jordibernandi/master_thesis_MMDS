We got a dune buggy to just get us around.  Okay, our friend here just told us that... The Philippine Eagle is actually native in this area around around 4 to 5 p.m.  in the afternoon.  Around how many?  About 50 plus.  About 50 plus Philippine Eagles would actually come here in the dunes area.  What do they do here? ",

They live in those hills there where you see the trees and they come down here to the sand dunes around 50 plus and they actually come here just to feed.  So they are native to this place.  They actually live here.  I was very surprised to find out that there are Philippine Eagles in this part of Luzon. ",

And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle.  that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent.  Now if that language sounds familiar again, that's Daniel's exact language of the great tribulation, the second half, three and a half years.  What is the greatest eagle on earth?  Why, the Philippine eagle is the very largest and strongest eagle on all of earth.  The only desert in the Philippines, by scientific definition, is the one in Luag.  And Abraham Perestal, known as Ferestal, in the late 1400s, yes, Columbus's era, was an Italian Jewish author.  This is preserved in the writings of Reverend Thomas Stackhouse from 1846, in fact.  But now we know where Columbus got this same reasoning from as he believed that the Lost Tribes of Israel came to the Philippines.  Let's see.  Pharesol locates some of the Lost Tribes of Israel.  Another Jewish author, in his description of the world, has found out very commodious habitations for the Ten Tribes.  These are the Lost Tribes of Israel.  Others he places in the desert of Chabor, which, according to him, lies upon the Indian Sea, where they live in the manner of the ancient Rachabites, without houses, sowing, or the use of wine.  Nay, he enters the Indies, the Isles of Bengala.  And what's this?  The Philippines.  Watch part 13 of Solomon's Gold Series for the full interpretation of Revelation 12, according to the restored geography of Ophir and Havilah.  This will blow your mind if you have not seen it yet.  and a great thing to review again.  And you will find there is a reason.  no one has been able to prove these findings wrong in three years.  There will be a link on the next screen.  You don't want to miss this. ",
