            "text": "My story, I haven't heard anybody else share a story that's similar to this.  We all have the coming out story, but mine was unique in that I was the church mom.  Denim jumpers, casserole dishes, the whole thing.  I had four children and my husband and I had a traditional marriage and very religious.  We had the children in church every time the doors were open, Bible drill and vacation Bible school.  And then as they began to be teenagers, disciple now, you know all these buzzwords.  And when the children were teenagers, and my four children are very close in age because I threw doubles at the end there.  So I had four children, three years.  So I have four teenagers literally at one time.  And they came to me with what I expected them to come to me with when they became teenagers, common church group teenager questions.  And I had taught these children to be relentless in their pursuit of knowledge and the scientific inconsistencies in the Bible, and they were on it.  And so they asked me these questions, and of course I'm that mom, and I said, those are valid.  Those are legitimate.  Let's see what we can do about finding the answers.  So we went first what I call inside the bubble.  We went to our youth minister and our pastor and our Sunday school teachers, and we asked those questions about the morality and the bashing the infants' heads on the rocks.  And we got... Party line answers, completely unsatisfying, but religion has responses to that.  They have answers to that.  It's baked in.  The children were starting high school, beginning to be exposed to different people, and then we started asking outside the bubble.  We started looking at history and anthropology and psychology and other religions, and one by one, each of the children according to their birth order and their personality, left.  They were not as vested as I was, so the walking away was easy for them.  In fact, the walking away was gratifying for them.  The oldest one, defiant, you know, he left that way.  The second one, who was a deep thinker, his was slower and more arduous.  The girls, they did it in their own way.  And then they began to leave me for college.  They were the only non-believers that I knew.  And I hadn't admitted to myself or to them that I was... not going to be confident in my beliefs anymore.  So they began to leave, and I'm alone.  My children are gone.  So as I was losing confidence in the faith, and I knew that my marriage would be at risk, And I knew that anything, that if I were to say what I was thinking, that it would hurt so many people who loved me, my parents, my brothers.  So I made the decision to stay in a little bit longer.  I probably continued to teach Sunday school, and I was miserable.  It was the darkest time in my life.  I was drinking a lot.  trying to figure out what to do with it until I reached the point where I didn't feel like I had a choice anymore, and I had to say what I believed and left church, and I was right about the marriage not surviving.  Came out to my parents and my brothers with them weeping, and my father, dad called me middle-aged crazy and my mother wept and she said the only thing that was giving her comfort was in southern baptist theology we have something called once saved always saved and it was the only thing that gave her any comfort.  and of course i didn't.  i didn't fight that.  that was not the time or place to have a theology discussion but it was.  it was as painful as it's as painful now thinking about it and talking about it as it was then.  however ten years out it's I can't say enough about how right my life feels right now.  I'm not saying it's perfect, and I'm not saying I don't have issues and struggles just like all of us do.  But being free of the dogma, being free to be able to address the issues, genuine issues, and And be able to base that on my motto is equal parts compassion and reason.  It's what drives me to do good in my community.  It's what drove me to run for public office because my neighbor's well-being, their genuine suffering and their genuine joy moves me to act.  My goal is to decrease the suffering and increase the joy.  It's that simple.  And the joy and the freedom that I find in that, so far surpasses any kind of gratification that I got when I was a religious person that I just can't articulate enough what it feels like to make a decision, make a rational, compassionate decision to make a difference.  you.
