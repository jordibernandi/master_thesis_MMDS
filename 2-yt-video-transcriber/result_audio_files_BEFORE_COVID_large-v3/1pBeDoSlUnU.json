Do you wish that you could see it all, maybe?  Is all creation groaning?  Is a new creation coming?  Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst?  Is it good that we remind ourselves of Him?  Is anyone worthy?  Is anyone whole?  Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?  The Lion, aren't you?  Who conquered the grave?  He's tainted, ruined, and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave.  Is he worthy?  Is he worthy of all blessing and honor and glory?  Is he worthy of his King?  Is the Father truly loved?  Does the Spirit move among us?  And does Jesus, our Messiah, hold forever those He loves?  Does our God intend to dwell again?  He does.  Is any one word Is anyone whole?  Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?  The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave.  He is David the root and the lamb who died to ransom the slave.  From every people and tribe.
