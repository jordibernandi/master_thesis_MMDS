            "text": "The cops are the Klan, bro.  Like I said, I'm going to make this clear.  I didn't say all cops are, but they're just doing some Ku Klux Klan shit.  What did the Klan do?  They just went around fucking with black folks, hanging them, killing them, whatever.  This is what they're doing.  People are going, what's going on?  It's Klan shit.  It's Ku Klux Klan fucking Southern Knight riding bullshit.  You know there's a dancing cop.  Have you heard about the dancing cop?  There's a cop that goes into black neighborhoods and dances, and then the next minute he's beating the shit out of black.  I saw that, yeah.  You see that shit?  He's dancing.  There's a cop.  He's fucking dancing with kids because for some reason, when white people come in and do a fucking dance move, we love them.  They trick us.  They get us.  They be like, damn, that motherfucking moonwalk.  Oh, shit, what's going on, man?  You know what I mean?  That's what some of these white politicians do.  They'll go to a black church whenever they need black votes.  First of all, we get shit on all year round, right?  For a couple years.  Then when it's time... To vote.  This same person has been shitting on black people, writing laws to fucking disenfranchise us.  All of a sudden, they go to a church, a black church in their life.  Listen, we need to come together.  And then he goes like this.  Oh, shit.  He just did the wave.  I'm going to vote for him.  Lord have mercy.  You know what I mean?  Some white politician does a dap and we're supposed to like that shit.  Black people need to stop falling for the fucking okey-doke.  Stop letting white people dance in front of you.  Cut that dumb shit out.  Why do people use that shit to fucking disrespect us?  There's enough black intellectuals.  You've gone to school.  You've got your PhDs.  You've done all this hard work and some fucker can moonwalk and then all of a sudden you vote for them?  You look at their philosophies.  They've been fucking you in the ass for four years and now because they moonwalked at your black church, you're fucking going to vote for them?  And listen, I'm not saying that all black churches are like that, but there are some black churches that need to be smacked in the fucking face because they're selling a lot of our people out.  A lot of these black churches and black pastors are selling our people the fuck out.  They use the God thing because they know we're vulnerable.  The cops are the Klan. ",
