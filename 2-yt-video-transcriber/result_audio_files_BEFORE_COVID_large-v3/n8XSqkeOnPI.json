            "text": "David Hume was born in Edinburgh in 1711 and was a central figure of the Scottish Enlightenment.  The philosophical context he was born into was one that was trying to understand the world scientifically.  Francis Bacon had argued for a science based on experience, an experimental inductive method of observing and recording.  Galileo had disproved the geocentric model of the universe, that everything revolved round the earth, and Newton had laid down the laws of motion and classical mechanics in physics.  Hume wanted to do the same for the human mind.  He worked for various merchants and governments, but spent most of his life writing, finding success in his day for a history of England.  He published a treatise of human nature in 1739 when he was just 28.  It's since become one of the most influential works in philosophy, but was largely ignored in his day.  He later clarified and distilled his thoughts into the Shorter, an inquiry concerning human understanding, which contains most of its key themes.  He was the third of the great British empiricists.  Locke and Berkeley before him have both contributed to building a picture of human reason based on the scientific method and empiricism, and Bertram Russell describes Hume as developing this to its logical conclusion.  His influence can be divided into two parts.  his theory of mind human understanding or psychology and the moral philosophy that follows from it.  it is necessary to understand the former to make sense of the latter and the relatively short inquiry is a clear witty introduction to his thought.  after an obligatory philosophical introduction that criticises how philosophers have approached their subject-matter in the past hume ends the first section with a call to undermine the foundations of an abstruse philosophy which seems to have hitherto served only as a shelter to superstition and a cover to absurdity and error.  he begins then by dividing the faculties of the mind into two impressions and ideas.  Impressions are like inputs, from the senses, from hunger, from emotion, the foundational feelings of the mind.  And ideas are then recollections of these impressions, which are inevitably weaker.  We receive the impression of a tree.  We recollect the idea of a tree.  Ideas can combine impressions.  We might see gold and then see a mountain and then combine them into a golden mountain.  This is how imagination works.  All ideas, though, however complicated, can be traced back to original impressions.  This is what makes him an empiricist.  All knowledge, he argues, comes through the senses.  Even the idea of God, for example, is the impression of wisdom, intelligence, power,  etc.,  all combined and multiplied to infinity.  In the next section he asks how we create ideas out of impressions.  All ideas, again, however complicated, must have been made through some logical connection, and for Hume there are only three, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect.  For resemblance, we might put the impressions of two different trees together into one category of tree.  Or we might put a tree and a bush together because they look similar.  For contiguity, we might see a bird perched on the tree and make a connection there.  For cause and effect, we see a pan over fire boils water and hold this idea in our mind.  All ideas are formed only by these associations.  Human reason, what the mind can create, can only be a product of either matters of fact, those impressions through the senses, or relations of ideas, combining those impressions together logically through resemblance, contiguity and cause and effect.  This is what became known posthumously as Hume's fork.  And that knowledge can only be acquired this way leads Hume to his scepticism.  Everything we know is based on experience and cause and effect.  We see the sunrise, it gets light.  We eat food, we stop getting hungry.  We put water over fire, it heats.  But because it's only based on experience, there is never any real, rigorous, philosophic guarantee that it'll happen again in the future.  We only ever see A leading to B. We never really see the cause of something.  We see a billiard ball hitting another and the other moving, but event A again only leads to event B. You can't see a necessary link, only correlation.  The effect is not a necessary part of the cause.  There is nothing inherently necessary.  in billiard ball one that equals the cause and effect of the event and our minds hume observed can only operate on the probability that an event will repeat in the same way.  we are confident that the sun will rise to-morrow because we have experienced it so often But there's no way of being certain.  This is still debated to this day and troubling for many scientists.  It's called the problem of induction.  Our minds act as though we can predict the future, but they are only acting, even the most scientific minds, on past experience.  Science doesn't guarantee anything, it only ever shows the probability of events recurring.  This, what Hume refers to as modest scepticism, gives us the limits of human reason.  But it also leads Hume to another question.  How do we live our lives effectively with no guarantees of what we know from experience repeating next time?  He says that every time we see a cause and effect repeat it grows into custom or habit, which he calls the great guide of human life.  He writes, all belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived merely from some object present to the memory or senses and a customary conjunction between that and some other object.  We put pencil to paper, it leaves a mark.  We repeat, it does it again, this leads to a custom in our mind.  We peel a banana, the inside is softer, so we eat it, we do it again and it forms another habit that helps us eat.  We can create new customs and habits by mixing old experiences together using the associations, resemblance, contiguity, cause and effect.  This pen resembles the pencil, maybe it does the same.  There's a tree that resembled the first tree.  Maybe a bird will be sat in it again, as trees and birds are contiguous.  Sand sometimes leads to sea.  The fact that everything comes to our minds only through impressions from the outside, even emotional feelings, and these associations leads Hume to a position of determinism.  Everything we choose to do has a cause outside of us, and so we're never the true authors of our actions.  Even presented with two seemingly equal choices, what to have for dinner, for example, choosing between a burger and pasta is never arbitrary.  We're influenced by what we had last, where we are, how much time we have, what our taste buds crave.  the closer you look he argues the harder it is to see free choice anywhere.  and he says that while there's no such thing as real chance chance being only the ignorance of the human senses in seeing the real cause and effect we nevertheless have to organise our habits around a judgment of probability.  we experience cold when the sun's at its lowest.  we experience that when it's farther from the earth snow is more likely or when certain wind conditions blow.  we can intuit the likeliness of snow tomorrow and then through habit or custom take a thick coat but we can never see the necessary connection.  we can never know for sure that it will snow tomorrow and logically we can never know that the sun will rise.  we can only expect He writes, we say, for instance, that the vibration of this string is the cause of this particular sound, but what do we mean by that affirmation?  We either mean that this vibration is followed by this sound, and that all similar vibrations have been followed by similar sounds, or that this vibration is followed by this sound, and that upon the appearance of one the mind anticipates the senses and forms immediately an idea of the other.  This view is troubling for many.  Of course we know that the sun will rise tomorrow, but it's also logically airtight, and philosophers attempting to dispute.  it is what made Hume's work so influential after his death.  The text finishes with a commentary on religion and miracles, views he was ostracised for in his day, but which also serves as a great analogy for a critique of any fantastical view.  A wise man, he says, proportions his belief to the evidence.  he proceeds with more caution.  he weighs the opposite experiments he considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments.  to that side he inclines with doubt and hesitation.  and when at last he fixes his judgment the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability.  all probability then supposes an opposition of experiments and observations where the one side is found to overbalance the other and to produce a degree of evidence proportioned to the superiority.  when we think about contrary testimonies witnesses contradicting each other or people having doubtful characters if a miracle is the suspension of the laws of nature what is more likely?  when anyone tells me that he saw a dead man restored to life i immediately consider with myself whether it be more probable that this person should either deceive or be deceived or that the fact to which he relates should really have happened.  i weigh the one miracle against the other and according to the superiority which i discover i pronounce my decision and always reject the greater miracle.  he finishes the inquiry with his famous lines, if we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school of metaphysics, for instance, let us ask, does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?  No.  Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?  No.  Commit it then to the flames, for it contains nothing but sophistry and illusion.  The inquiry can be thought of as an introduction to the treatise, which contains in three volumes a more detailed exploration of understanding, that which we saw here, and in volume two, passions, and in volume three, morals.  The rest of his thought expands upon this, what some consider to be the very first psychology, and I'll return to his moral philosophy in part two.
