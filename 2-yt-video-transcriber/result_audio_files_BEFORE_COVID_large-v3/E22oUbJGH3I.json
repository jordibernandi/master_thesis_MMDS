            "text": "I think that the things that have brought us here today tell us a lot about the development of our continent of Africa.  I'm beginning by saying that the place of the diaspora, the status of people in the diaspora, of the African diaspora, is intimately linked with what happens on the continent.  An Africa strong and performing transforms your position and your status here in Europe.  but an Africa which continues to live the narrative of poverty, hungry children, people going across the Sahara, going in rickety boats and dying in Lampisuda to get to Europe.  That Africa is not a narrative that is going to help you over here.  So I think between you and us, our main task is the transformation of the continent.  And why do I say so?  Just one simple example.  The Chinese diaspora is supposed to be some 60 million people.  And in the table of states that constitute the 25th country in the world.  They're saying that of the 52 billion foreign investment that went into China in the 80s and 90s that transformed China into what it is today, the manufacturing hub of the world, 50% of that, 26%, came from the Chinese overseas community.  And that development of China.  that has taken place has changed the status and the position of Chinese. ",
