You admitted at the beginning of the show that you hated communism.  Are you a communist now?  Yes.  Okay, so tell us why you want to smash the state and capitalism.  Capitalists steal labor value from workers.  Congratulations, you're a communist.  Fuck yeah.  Now, Audrey, you're a college student.  Are you a communist now?  Sure am.  Okay, but isn't it true that capitalism makes life better for everybody because of the profit motive?  Isn't it competition that drives innovation forward and makes everything better for all of humanity?  Um, no, that's fucking bullshit.  That's right.  Very good.  Now Casey here actually has a very good answer for what actually drives humanity forward.  It's not capitalist exploitation of workers.  It's not the wage system, of course.  It's not greed that motivates humans to do great things in our world.  It's the principle that says that humans do great things whenever we work together.  How about that?  You ready?  The pressure's on.  This is the system that Piotr Kropotkin said was, under any circumstances, the greatest advantage in the struggle for life.  Mutual aid? ",
