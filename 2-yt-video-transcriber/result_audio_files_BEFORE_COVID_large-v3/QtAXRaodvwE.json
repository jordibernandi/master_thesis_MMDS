The balance between the two prevents the star from collapsing or expanding into infinity.  But if you're just talking about humans or objects on the Earth, then the story is different.  Gravity is fighting a few small forces, which really poses no match.  The centrifugal force, for example, is a relatively small force that tries to knock everything on the surface of the Earth to space.  Gravity very easily counters that.  It's so funny because I've seen so many flat earthers say, well, centrifugal force should whip everyone into space.  Well, the answer to that is gravity.  And then now you're picking the other side of the straw and saying, well, what force is gravity fighting?  Bitch, please.  You know, the saying that gravity prevents us from flying into space doesn't even really say specifically that we would literally shoot off into space.  It just means there wouldn't be a force that keeps us on the ground, so we would just float away.  And if you push off against the ground at all, Newton's Law states that you would just travel upwards.  Unless, of course, something stops you.  So yes, gravity is fighting, say, centrifugal force, but its main effect is that it holds you in place, so that you don't float around everywhere.

First of all, this so-called force is present due to differences in air pressure.  Air tends to move from higher pressure to lower pressure.  So why doesn't air just fly off into space, and as a result take everything with it, including humans and other objects?  Well, the air pressure on Earth isn't the same throughout all altitudes.  The higher you go up, the less pressure there is.  So think of it this way.  Gravity could indeed potentially lead to pressure differences.  That's why you can suck air upwards through a vacuum cleaner.  However, this multiple layer of pressure is what keeps things in place, and let me explain.  It's a gradient.  At the highest point on Earth, there is practically zero air pressure.  This, compared to space, is negligible, because the difference is so little.  Gravity can easily counter that.  Then, as you move downwards, it slowly increases.  But no matter where you are, there will never be such a big difference in air pressure to give gravity a challenge.  The so-called sucking force can only be strong if there is a huge pressure difference in immediate proximity to each other.  But since the air pressure is like a gradient on Earth, getting less and less as you travel upwards, there's never going to be an incredibly high pressure right next to an incredibly low pressure.  So that force is negligible when you compare it to gravity.  And if there's no pressure difference to create that sucking force into the air, there's no air that can push you or other objects out into space.  It's that simple.  There's no barrier required. ",

It used a bigger person than usual and the Sun and Moon are positioned to what we see from Earth, not from where their positions actually are.  If you wanted this diagram to be accurate, the Sun and Moon would be many times bigger.  They wouldn't be the small size that we see here.  So, you know, why don't we do that?  if we're going to take that direction?  Yeah, let's scale it up.  Oh, and while we're at it, we would also have to increase the distance.  There's no way I could make it entirely to scale, so let's just arbitrarily increase it just to make it more accurate.  Now, of course, they still wouldn't be visible at the same time if it weren't for atmospheric refraction, but do you see how this diagram isn't really the best to use here?  The small sun and moon were used to put into our perspective, and from our perspective, they would be higher up like what we saw in the original diagram.  The arrows there also just show that they're far away.  You trying to make it realistic in turn made it more difficult to visualize.  But then if you wanted it to be 100% realistic, then we would also have to increase the size of the Sun and Moon, and the distance.  Of course, what I put here isn't perfectly to scale, but it's accurate enough to give the right idea. ",
