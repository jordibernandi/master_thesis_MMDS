            "text": "Yeah, I know.  It's highly annoying.  I bet.  Oh, it's even going to be more so now.  Yeah, it's because of the Terry stop originally, not a traffic stop.  That's the only reason?  Yeah.  Yeah, so if you'd have called him out for the traffic stop on the... Yeah, but because of that, you know what I mean?  Anyway, I'll send you the legal update on it.  Go ahead and hop out.  Am I stepping out?  Go ahead and step out for me, sir.  My left arm is numb.  Sure.  I didn't know you were a doctor to lawyer, police officer and the doctor.  I feel pain like you.  That's why officer safety is first, right?  Because you feel pain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Just especially for me?  We're all recording.  We're all still recording.  The whole conversation, yes, sir.  We can't do it until afterwards.  Please review the body cam.  They will all be reviewed.  All right.  And I'm going to want that body cam, so please don't erase it.  We don't erase anything like that.  Well, I had an issue where an officer erased it because it wasn't in order.  Well, we can't do that.  Ours are kept separate, and we will not be.  So why wasn't I arrested right now?  I was prepared to go to jail.  I want to know why I wasn't arrested.  Right.  If you want to head down to the Johnson Park.  Yeah, head down, Ms.  Blair.  I'm in on 200, but I can't.  You're in what?  200.  Oh, okay.  Well, never mind.  You don't have to worry about that.  The reason why is because recently we were taught for what's called a Terry stop.  Yeah.  A Terry stop.  Explain it to the young lady.  Hold on a second.  Terry stop.  Now, she said she did witness.  No.  Yeah, if you don't mind, go down there.  Thank you.  A Terry stop originally, but she did say that she saw you not use a turn signal.  But the original stop was for the Terry stop.  Yes, sir.  So because the Terry stop and not the, you know what I mean?  Technically, if she's pulling you over for the no turn signal, then she can say, hey, you know what I'm saying?  Sir, I don't mean to stop you.  That's fine.  No problem.  Please review the body cam.  I'm just telling you what I was told, okay?  And you're asking me why you weren't being arrested?  Right.  I'm saying because I believe, I believe that she called it out.  She originally stopped you because of suspicious activity.  She said that you'd stopped and you'd went and you'd stopped and she just didn't know what was going on.  So whatever later, realizing, well, you know, maybe there was this traffic.  You know how it is.  You can drive down the road.  We can find a seasoned officer can find 50 violations in a block, right?  But to go back, if that's not the original reason, I don't want... Well, I don't want anybody going to jail when they're not supposed to.  I appreciate you doing the right thing.  So don't think I'm just trying to get on you.  No, no, I completely understand.  Hey, if I was in handcuffs, I would want to know every reason and every reason.  I wasn't.  I get it.  She came to the car, right?  She said, what's up behind me?  I said, what's going on?  She said, what's your name?  I said, no, what'd I do?  Second time she said, what's your name?  I identified myself.  I didn't give her my ID because it's invalid, right?  Okay.  Got a hole in it.  Not invalid.  Okay.  So I said, my name is Quentin Terrell Booker.  My birthday is... This is what I said to her the second time.  The third time she kept saying, give me your ID, give me your ID.  I said, it's invalid.  But I kept telling her my name and my birthday.  So I identified myself numerous times because she didn't like my attitude.  And I kept trying to explain, ma'am, it's got nothing to do with you.  And then I identified myself just to set about her curiosity.  That wasn't enough because she didn't like my conversation.  I was getting arrested before the first time.  I said no. ",
