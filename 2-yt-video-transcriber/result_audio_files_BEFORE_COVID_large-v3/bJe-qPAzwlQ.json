            "text": "Hello there, I'm Lloyd Evans and you're watching the John Cedars channel from the bunker.  And this morning I put a tweet out asking for suggestions for a brief video.  And the winning suggestion was from Ashley Porciuncula.  I hope I've pronounced the name properly.  Ashley said, have you done anything about the requirement for JW women to wear head coverings?  It's a thing that not many know about.  Sometimes I even forget.  And of course, why haven't I?  I think I have mentioned it before, and I'm sure I've mentioned it at some point, maybe in one of my rebuttals, but it does merit addressing because I When you think of head coverings in a religious context, you think of perhaps the Amish, or you think of Muslims with the hijab.  You don't necessarily think of Jehovah's Witnesses, but it is true that Jehovah's Witnesses encourage women under certain circumstances... to wear head coverings.  and this advice can be found.  well actually you can find it very easily just by typing into google head coverings jw.org.  you should find that an article on the subject pops up directly on the website.  so it's not something that they are trying to conceal from people or anything.  But it's certainly not something that they are necessarily jumping up and down about or trying to promote the fact that they encourage women to do this.  But the best way of verifying that this is indeed a Jehovah's Witness teaching is to look at the publication of How to Remain in God's Love, which is a very recent publication from 2017, replacing the previous Keep Yourselves in God's Love book.  And on pages 243, 244 in the end notes, under number 15, there is a brief paragraph about head covering where it says there may be times when a sister is asked to do something in the congregation that is normally done by a brother.  When she does this work she shows her respect for Jehovah's arrangement by wearing a head covering.  But the need to cover her head applies only in certain situations.  For example, a sister would wear something to cover her head if she conducts a Bible study when her husband or a baptized brother is present.  And it quotes there a verse in 1 Corinthians, which I hope, if you don't mind, I will come back to later, because it is interesting.  But this scenario of conducting a Bible study, I guess that's when I'm most familiar from my recollections as a witness with this strange phenomenon of being in the preaching work and maybe going on a Bible study.  I remember once I was doing pioneering with a sister I fancied, frankly, and she she was calling on one of her Bible studies and she said, oh actually Lloyd, I need to put a head covering on because you're baptized and we're visiting one of my Bible studies and we might have a Bible study on the doorstep because doorstep Bible studies were a thing back then.  I'm not sure whether they still are.  So we did this Bible study on the doorstep and sure enough, I think she put a hat on or something.  and But it didn't come up too frequently, that situation.  But it is a thing, and this brief paragraph on head coverings refers to another paragraph in the same publication, which supposedly sheds more light on this, and I... I looked up the paragraph in question.  This is still in the book, How to Remain in God's Love.  It's frankly just a rewording of the end notes.  It's just a reorganization of the sentences almost.  So it says, There may not be any elders or ministerial servants available to handle an assignment in the congregation.  Other baptised brothers can usually help, but if none are available, a sister may need to do a task that would usually be done by a baptised brother.  if that is the case she would wear something to cover her head perhaps a scarf or a hat.  in this way she shows that she respects jehovah's arrangement of headship both in the family and in the congregation.  So again, not much different from the previous paragraph, but here it's talking about tasks in a congregation.  And it's saying that if there's no one available who has a penis, basically, and in an emergency situation, the sisters need to be called upon, they need to wear a head covering.  And again, it alludes to 1 Corinthians chapter 11, which again, we will come to later.  But I thought it would be interesting to go to the previous publication, Keep Yourselves in God's Love, which has a slightly more extensive material on this, although nothing that really sheds too much more light on this.  But there was a really interesting part, which I'm going to read to you, pages 209 and 210, where it says, \"...unless she gives due recognition to her husband's authority,\".  talking here of a Jehovah's Witness wife, \"...she would shame her husband if she handled responsibilities that Jehovah assigned to  him.\".  For example, if it became necessary for her to conduct a Bible study in her husband's presence, she would acknowledge his authority by wearing a head covering.  She would do so whether he is baptized or not, since he is the head of the family.  So it's not even a question of simply... it being about believing males, if you are a wife and your husband isn't a Jehovah's Witness, you still have to think about this.  And you'll see that I've highlighted there the footnote where it says, \"...a Christian wife would not normally pray aloud in the presence of her believing husband except in unusual  circumstances.\"  Such as, if he has been rendered mute by an illness.  So... And that had me scratching my head because I was thinking, surely in all of our family worship sessions, you know, growing up as a witness when I was little, surely at one point mum said a prayer or was asked to say a prayer by my dad.  And I can't, maybe she did, but I can't really remember that happening.  It's just such an odd thing that women are well, they're denigrated in this way by having to basically humiliate themselves or do something that is a sign of humiliation.  And even then, there are circumstances where, well, we know that they can't give talks, for example, in Kingdom Halls, but it's saying here not even offer a prayer out loud in a family setting.  just seems so over the top when you when you wake up and kind of look back on the whole thing.  um i also want to show you um more from the god's love book.  this is pages 211 212 where it says now the angels may see instances when a christian woman is more experienced more knowledgeable and more intelligent than a baptized male in the congregation, yet she readily shows her submission to his authority.  In some cases, the woman is an anointed Christian who will later become one of Christ's joint heirs.  Such a woman will eventually serve in a position even higher than that enjoyed by angels and rule with Christ in heaven.  What a fine example for the angels to observe now.  Really, what a privilege all sisters have to demonstrate humble obedience through their loyal and submissive conduct in the sight of millions of faithful angels.  And you will understand when I read the verse in 1 Corinthians why it's talking about angels.  But again, what odd thinking.  I mean, one of the things that really puzzled me as a believer was the fact that women are not allowed to speak up.  Well, they are obviously allowed to give comments at the meeting, but they can't give talks.  The only time they're allowed on the platform is under the direction of a man, usually to give an experience or to give a demonstration of how to conduct themselves in the preaching work.  That's the only arrangement, that's the only way that they can even be on the platform.  it's so odd that they aren't given a voice.  And even in kind of affairs of the congregation, for example, where decisions need to be made about, you know, do we get a refurbishment?  What do we do about, you know, the bills or the accounts or whatever?  They don't get a voice in any of the running of the congregation.  But in the case of a Jehovah's Witness woman who happens to consider herself, as being one of the anointed, who believes that she is one of the 144,000 who go to heaven and don't live on the earth after Armageddon has wiped the population.  Um... She's in a really strange situation of not having a voice in such menial affairs as what happens in her congregation, but in the future she believes that she's going to be in heaven ruling over the earth with Jesus.  But she doesn't have a voice.  in the congregation before Armageddon.  It's a really odd state of affairs.  But I promised I would read to you from 1 Corinthians, which is the verse that keeps popping up when they're justifying these rules on women covering their heads.  It's a really... fascinating verse to read in the 21st century when you know women are no longer chattel and you know have equality or should have equality alongside men.  you read from verse 4 of first corinthians 11. it says every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head shames his head.  But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head, for it is one and the same as if she were a woman with a shaved head.  Paul apparently fixated with how one's follicles are arranged.  For if a woman does not cover herself, she should have her hair cut off, But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved, she should be covered.  It goes on to say, For a man should not have his head covered, as he is God's image and glory, but the woman is man's glory.  For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man.  And what is more, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.  That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head because of the angels.  So it's all because of the angels, if you remember earlier.  We wouldn't want to put on a bad show for those watching on from the heavens, They have a perfect view of what is or isn't on our heads and it's something that would greatly offend them if women were to do manly things or things that only men are allowed to do without a head covering.  But what astonishing... What astonishing rhetoric about women.  And it's difficult not to deviate into my atheism here.  I have done videos before on what I think about the Bible, but how do you get past this overt sexism by the Apostle Paul?  I was reading these words aloud to Deanna earlier, where it says, For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man.  And she said, I'm pretty sure every man comes from a woman.  It's clearly alluding to the myth of the Garden of Eden.  we now know that man didn't suddenly pop into existence six thousand years ago in a garden with a talking snake.  we now know that man has been around for hundreds of thousands of years.  But aside from that, what you have here in whoever wrote this, and you could argue whether it was Paul or whether these are verses that someone else added on.  That's one of the confusing things about the New Testament is no one's really sure exactly who wrote what.  But let's say it is Paul who wrote this.  Here is a man who genuinely feels that women are inferior.  and is coming up with almost any reason to justify this pre-existing assumption, including coming up with ridiculous stipulations about how a woman may or may not, I don't know, have her head arranged or have her dress and clothing arranged.  It's clearly written by a backwards or a an ignorant man living in a time where women were chattel, were treated as being a commodity owned by men, and who would go around having to, essentially as we see in the Muslim world, having to basically cover themselves up because they were a man's property.  And if they weren't covered up, it would be interpreted as them displaying themselves to to everyone or trying to attract another male.  That seems to be what this is about here.  And again, Paul has tried to come up with a reason, a theological reason, why it's also wrong for a woman to not have her head covered doing you know religious activities and it all has to do apparently with well man did not come from woman but the woman came from the man.  and also oh and think about the angels as well.  we don't want the angels to be offended because they're looking down and they can see whether your head is covered or uncovered or shaved or unshaved.  it's just.  it's astonishing isn't it?  And again, I really am not interested in offending religious people here.  You have to understand that I have to be open about what my thoughts are.  And I've always, even as a believer in God, I struggled with verses like this because it's just demonstrably silly, quite frankly.  But this is where it comes from.  This is where the Jehovah's Witness head covering requirement comes from.  And yes, it's true.  It is required in certain circumstances for Jehovah's Witness women to wear head coverings.  So I hope you have found this video interesting.  Please don't forget to subscribe to the John Cedars channel for more such videos.  And as always, thank you for watching.  All too long I fell from the top of the world But it's finally over, finally over.  I gotta last one minute just to get out of life So I keep it together, thinking it's not forever. ",
