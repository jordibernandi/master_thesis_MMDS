I think Destiny believes everything he's talking about.  I think he's, you know, just more centrist than me, and he's out there making his case, but he's honest, you know?  In the case of Dave Rubin... He's just like he really is just a pure grifter.  Like that's it.  That's all.  It's all just looking for angles and and, you know, trying to find his little niche.  And it's just sad because he's like a hopeless soul floating around in the ether, just trying to find a way to fit in and have a niche.  And it's amazing to me that some people still don't see through it.  But basically, everybody in public life kind of now sees through it.  And just sees how embarrassing it is and how this guy was never.  he never really believed anything he was saying.  He was just trying to get.  he's one of those guys who like just kind of he wanted to be known.  He wanted to be famous and he couldn't make it in other ways.  So he just kind of settled on I guess I'll do like political stuff.  And that's explains his existence.  And that explains what he's doing now.  And I think that's clear to see at this point. ",

Why are you doing that?  like it's hilarious because he does this whole.  like me bro i'm against social justice warriors i'm against snowflakes and then behind the scenes he is the biggest of all the snowflakes.  anybody who criticizes him even a little bit he's like trying to get in touch with them and saying like what are you doing this for man?

And every now and then we would DM and chat a little bit.  And then, uh, the Israel issue came up and then he kept for, I swear to God, it was for like a week or two every day.  He would DM me some sort of story about how Palestinians were evil and Israelis are awesome.  And then eventually I was trying to be nice about it, but I was like, Hey man, listen, I can't really debate this now.  I, you know, I got stuff that I got to handle and got these issues at home or whatever.  And, um, he then like a year later used that to try to say to me publicly like on twitter something along the lines of like and he couldn't even debate the issue with me of israel because he obviously i know what i'm talking about and he doesn't know what he's talking about.  and i had to respond and i was like dude that was just my nice way of trying to like put you down and say like get the fuck out of my dms.  i don't want to talk to you about this anymore because you're annoying and you're super biased like.  i was just trying to let him off and be like Like, okay, let's like slightly tiptoe away from this topic and just not discuss this.  But he interpreted that as like, weak.  Kyle doesn't even want to like stand for his positions or whatever. ",

If you really believe in the battle of ideas, then you would obviously have on communists, have on Marxists, talk to them.  Because that's, I mean, that's an outsider ideology, is it not?  But no, he doesn't do that.  He just made a conservative safe space.  And I was like, oh, so he's just like a total hack.  And he found an angle to be more lucrative.  So that's when I realized. ",

He doesn't have that governor in his head.  That's not there.  So for him, he's just almost kind of like Trump in a way, how Trump just kind of exists and says whatever the hell he wants.  At least in the case of Trump, it's hilarious sometimes.  With Rubin, it's not hilarious.  It's just sad.  He doesn't have that thing.  that makes him feel shame, because or else he would have packed it in a long time ago.  Dude, his entire Reddit is people just dunking on him. ",
