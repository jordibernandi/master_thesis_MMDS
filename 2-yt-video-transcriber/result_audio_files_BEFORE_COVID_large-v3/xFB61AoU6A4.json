            "text": "hi guys welcome back to my channel.  so today's have a short video for you.  it's just a little bit of a housekeeping update on my content.  myself and blonde in the belly of the beast as you probably already know have discussed starting a brand new channel that's focused on mom content.  we want to discuss everything from trying to conceive, to pregnancy, family planning, childbirth education, just everything related to becoming a mom and moving into motherhood.  So that's the direction that I've already been taking my content on this channel.  but we both felt that as a team, we could offer something really of value to this community, and we wanted a new space for that.  So tomorrow, premiering at 1 p.m.  Eastern Time will be the very first episode of our new channel which is going to be called motherland.  I can't remember who it was exactly who offered that suggestion to us.  I'm so sorry that I can't give you credit for it but that's what we're going for.  so whoever you are out there thank you so much for offering us that advice because we were really struggling with the Really struggling with trying to find a name as you can tell myself critical condition and blonde in the belly of the beast.  We aren't the most Skilled individuals when it comes to thinking of a channel name, so we're going with motherland.  There will be a link in the description so that you can go over to that new channel.  Please subscribe So that you are notified and you don't miss the new episode.  that's going to be premiering, like I said, tomorrow at 1 p.m.  Eastern time.  And so, yeah, I'm just I'm really excited about where we're going to be able to take our content, you know, to try and put a bit of positivity into the movement, offer something of value, hopefully to young women out there and young men.  There will also be things like interviews.  We have some interviews that already are lined up with some big names on some very interesting topics.  So there's going to be a wide range of videos made over there.  Not just myself and Blonde talking about pregnancy symptoms.  Uh, there will be, I think one of the main, uh, interviews that we're going to be doing in the beginning is on circumcision.  And, uh, I think we have an interview lined up with a gentleman who just completed a popular documentary on the subject.  So there's going to be, there's going to be a lot of cool stuff going on over there.  Um, but ultimately rooted in pro-natalism, pro-family and pro-nation, uh, pro-nation type.  stuff.  so thank you so much.  uh i hope that you will uh go over and subscribe there and that you will enjoy this new direction that myself and blonde are going in.  thanks so much for listening guys bye.
