            "text": "Hey Facebook family, good morning.  I just wanted to come to you real quick because listen, there's a lot of back and forth about this whole slip of the tongue with the whole combination of Knicks and Lakers and Nakers and niggas right.  so look here's the deal.  you know as with all that I say and do on my timeline your agreement is not required.  I know what I heard.  And what's interesting to me, family, is how folks are so quick to tell us to get over it, move along, nothing to see here.  And what's also amazing to me is how so many of us are ready to move along and want to tell the others.  Did you guys come out the house to tell me to move along?  I'm just saying, because I'm a field Negro kind of girl, right?  A descendant of Harriet Tubman.  I'm not so forgiving, family.  And I don't know why you are either.  But listen, if you want to forgive and if you believe, hey, Pam, good morning.  Hey, Mike, good morning.  If you want to believe that it was a slip of the tongue, listen, if it works for you, It works for me.  If that helps you get through your day, I am not here to tell you what you think you heard.  Let's just say that.  Hey, Barry.  But what I'm not going to do is debate it.  I'm not going to debate it and, you know, I don't know.  I was a little disappointed because it's MSNBC and I love, love, love MSNBC.  I don't know this lady's name.  I've never heard of her before.  But... I'm just not buying the slip of the tongue.  But that's just me.  I think having done what I did makes me suspicious of everybody.  Can I just say that?  Warren, I'm sorry, William, what you missed is there was a video circulating on social media of a female on MSNBC, an analyst, reporter, whatever she is, talking about Kobe Bryant and what he meant.  and what his death has meant to others.  And in so doing, she says, according to a tweet that she put out, that she was stuttering and she misspoke and she combined the word Knicks and Lakers into my ear.  It sounds like she called him or called the team the LA Niggas.  Niggers is what she said.  Sounds like Tommy.  So that's what the debate is.  And a lot of folks are saying, hey, keep it moving, nothing to see here.  A lot of folks who look like me are saying, keep it moving, nothing to see here.  And so I just find it very interesting that we are so quick to forgive.  Good morning, Duane.  I appreciate you keeping me in prayer.  A queen warrior is in need of constant, constant prayer.  So whenever two or three of you can come together on my behest, or at my behest, rather, on my behalf.  Yeah, I'm stuttering and stammering too, and I haven't said anything that sounded offensive or racist yet, have I?  Okay, yeah, she said she meant to say nicks and whatever, whatever, and you know, what would you say, right?  She gotta come up with something.  She has to say something that sounds, Reasonable to her and evidently reasonable to a lot of you because you guys are buying that I call bullshit But that's just me.  I'm just saying You know, I think sometimes we are just too easy too quick to forgive and you know turn the other cheek and I'm just not built that way.  So, um For those of you who are bothered, I won't be debating it with you.  I just wanted to come and just say that here because I just wanted to come and say it here.  And while I'm here talking with you, let me just say this for those of you who haven't seen my post earlier.  I'm actually in Houston today.  I was getting ready for a little press conference.  We're going to be talking about a situation going on here in Houston involving two Houston Police Department officers who were allowed to resign.  I'm sorry, were allowed to retire on the heels of a no-knock warrant that was issued last year and resulted in the death of two people.  Dennis Tuttle and his wife, Regina Nicholas, were killed when these officers served a no-knock warrant on their house.  Now, the problem with this no-knock warrant is that brother man, Mr.  Goines, Officer Goines in the narcotics unit, lied.  to get this no-knock warrant.  And I may share a little later with you, if you've never seen a no-knock warrant be executed, it's a thing.  I participated in no-knock warrants, search warrants when I was working South Bureau Crash.  And I tell you, I never liked it.  Those things make the hair on the back of my neck stand up because they're dynamic.  That's how we describe them.  They're certainly very dangerous.  Any of you can imagine being awakened in the early morning hours and that's why you get a no-knock warrant so that you can go early and you don't have to announce yourself as the police.  Imagine being awakened with somebody just breaking in your door with flashbangs which are akin to a hand grenade being thrown In your apartment in your home window glass shattering.  imagine that happening.  anybody would think you know somebody's trying to come in here and hurt me.  and that's what.  Dennis Tuttle and Regina Nicholas thought a year ago yesterday.  it happened a year ago.  tomorrow is the.  i'm sorry tomorrow, a year ago.  tomorrow it's the anniversary.  tomorrow.  And so, you know, we're going to be talking tonight here in Houston about what Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo described as rogue cops.  I'm sure that that wasn't the first time that that officer Goines lied to a judge in an affidavit to get a no-knock warrant.  It wasn't until it resulted in the death of two people that now all of a sudden everybody's doing what they do.  Y'all know.  clutching their pearls.  Everybody's all surprised.  And we know that this is probably not the first time.  And so now the district attorney here in Houston is taking a look at about, I think it was 1400 cases.  are under review and 22 of those 1400 cases that are now under review by the district attorney are linked to this officer Goines.  So 27 cases have already been dismissed.  So you know what that means.  Lots of lawsuits, maybe some new millionaires in the state of Texas because of this officer lying to get search warrants or lying to put people in the system.  You know how they do.  Not everybody.  Just some, right?  And so that's what we're going to be talking about.  That's why I'm here in Texas.  And if there's anyone in the vicinity here at Houston who wants to come through tonight at 6  p.m.,  there is a poster, flyer, if you will, that I have put up on all of my pages so you can see, you know.  where it'll be going down tonight here in Houston, Texas.  So, just wanted to come and say good morning and just say, you know, my two cents about this whole slip of the tongue.  I call bullshit.  You know, that's just me.  And, you know, if you disagree, that's fine because your agreement is not required with me.  I'm just saying.  Family, have a good rest of your day.  Have a good rest of the week.  And listen, I said this in my post.  And, you know, it feels like I am just surrounded by death all of a sudden.  Life is short.  Life is precious.  And so you need to live it like you mean it.  For real, for real.  You know, I've often said, if you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much space, family.  Be good to one another.  I appreciate you.  I love you.  And be good and be safe.  Thank you, David, for the positive energy.  I appreciate that.  Yeah.  OK, Henry.  So, OK, you said she was thinking about the knickers, but yeah, whatever.  I don't know what she was thinking about, but listen, she's a professional.  And so come on now.  Come on.  I call bullshit.  And so I'm just.  I'm not one for giving breaks anymore.  Because listen, I've had a slip of the tongue myself and nobody gave me the benefit of the doubt.  So I'm not here to give it.  We've got news media arriving.  We're going to have a little press conference.  And so you can see or hear in the background what's going on.  Hi, how are you?  So now, family, I must say goodbye.  Not sure what channel this is here.  Looks like a 13 on the mic.  So for those of you here in Houston, if you get a chance to pick up the news tonight, you might see me talking about why I'm here.  Okay, I'm reading, I'm reading, I'm reading.  Let's see.  Ralph, what are you saying?  Oh, God bless me.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you, thank you.  I appreciate that.  Karen, classmate, I appreciate you for commenting.  Thanks for checking in.  So I'll keep you posted.  Eventually, I'll have a videotape of tonight community meeting, and I'll share that with you as well because that's what I do.  So be good family, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon. ",
