            "text": "We are used to thinking about the free market as the most efficient economic system.  We are told so all the time by all kinds of people.  But is it really true?  Is it really all that efficient?  After looking at the evidence I don't think so anymore.  And maybe by the end of this video you'll come to the same conclusion.  Let's start with the reason neoliberals, that people support the free market no matter what, think that it's the most efficient economic system in chapter one, the market in theory.  You've probably heard this already, so I'll try to make this as short as possible.  The purpose of the free market is to distribute resources.  The market doesn't produce anything on its own, just transports stuff from one person who has it to one person who needs it.  It does this with financial incentive.  If resources are scarce in a region, Then their price will rise and there will be an incentive to produce the resources or transport them to the people who need them.  In the end the person making and distributing the products makes a profit and the people who need the products get them.  That was a rather theoretical explanation.  so let's look at an example.  We have two towns, we name them Berlin and London.  London has a lot of food and Berlin was just hit by a drought and it doesn't have any food.  Because of the scarcity the little food that's left in Berlin will become really expensive.  So expensive in fact that the rich people in London get an idea.  They will buy a lot of food in London and sell it in Berlin for profit.  If possible they will even increase the food production to provide exactly as much food as everyone needs.  Sounds great, doesn't it?  And so natural as well.  No boss, no management, just people acting in the best way possible.  And it would be great if it worked like that in Praxis.  But I'm afraid it doesn't.  And I'm afraid there are many cases in which the free market wastes a lot of resources.  Let's look at how it really works in part 2.  The market in Praxis.  The free market has been in place for roughly 200 years in most European countries by now.  Even longer in the USA.  Right now the market is global and the entire world ignoring North Korea, trades with each other.  You can buy anything in any country and sell it in any other country to anyone who will buy it.  It's a global system.  So let's look at our example again.  We have Berlin and we have London and Berlin is starving.  Does London still deliver the aid to Berlin in real life?  The answer is yes.  Under one condition.  Only if the people of Berlin are rich enough to justify their transport costs.  Remember, the investors from London only help Berlin if they can make a profit of it.  This may not seem too complicated, but it leads to a lot of problems and frankly ridiculous situations in real life.  Globally, Earth produces enough food for roughly 10 billion people.  There are only 7.5 billion people on Earth.  This fact combined with the hyper-efficient free market should mean that every single person on Earth is overweight, right?  You already know that that's not true.  There are millions of people starving each year and according to the United Nations 800 million people lack the food to live a healthy life.  Remember, this isn't a problem with the amount that's produced.  This is a problem of distribution.  And the global network of distribution is the free market.  So how does it fail?  It seemed like such a great system in theory and the problem wasn't something many people considered, to be honest.  Overproduction.  The free market doesn't produce as much as it needs, it produces way more.  The reason is simple.  If you produce groceries and sell them to a supermarket, then you have to compete with different producers as well.  Let's say your apples are displayed just as much as your rival's apples.  And what do you do if you can't sell all of them?  Do you produce less?  Of course not.  You invest in the advertisement and hope that people will buy YOUR apples next time.  This problem is made worse by a practice done by supermarkets.  Overstocking.  If a supermarket displays 10 apples, people will buy 9 and nobody wants to buy the last apple.  Why exactly that is, isn't quite clear.  But it's been tested enough times for a supermarket to take it into consideration.  That's why they overstock.  They will display 30 apples in order to sell 20.  What happens to the other 10 apples?  They are usually thrown away after a few days of lying around.  They could be donated but that would reduce the price of the other apples.  so there is a financial incentive to throw them away instead.  Because supermarkets also compete with each other they have to keep up the highest possible standards and throw out any products that show faults or near their sell by date.  So we have factories producing more than people need and supermarkets buying more than they sell and all of that ends up wasted.  This is inefficient.  The free market uses a whole lot of work to produce products that will never be needed.  And of course there are ecological problems with this.  Producing food and then throwing it away is terrible for the environment.  So the market is wasting energy and resources to produce stuff we don't need.  And there is one more reason to be critical of the market.  Even though it overproduces so much, there are still millions starving on the planet.  Roughly 9 million people starve each year.  This is because of what I mentioned before.  There is no profit in feeding the poor.  How can that be, you may ask?  In our theoretical example, the market quickly distributed the resources for the benefit of most people.  And the reason this doesn't work in reality is inequality.  To get back to our example, the investors in London will only send food to Berlin if the people of Berlin are rich enough to make it worthwhile.  If the cost of transport from London to Berlin is higher than the profit then they won't help even if London has an abundance of food.  And of course that's what we see in real life.  There are millions of tons of food being thrown away in Europe and America while people in Africa and Asia are starving.  To me this isn't efficient.  To me an efficient system would at least be able to distribute food to everyone who needs it.  If someone says that the free market is efficient they should have to be able to explain how.  In a world of 7.5 billion people that produces food for 10 billion there are almost a billion people living with hunger.  I believe at this point I've made it clear why I think that the free market doesn't deserve to be called an efficient system.  Of course there are many counterarguments to be made against my case and I spend the rest of the video countering those in\u2026.  Part 3 \u2013 Liberal Critiques Critique 1.  What about tariffs and import dues?  A frequent argument for the free market is that the governments are obstructing it.  Tariffs and import dues do in fact make selling things in other countries more expensive and thus discourage it.  The neoliberal solution would be to abolish import dues so that, for example, European food waste could more easily be sent to Africa.  On the surface this seems like a great idea and the hungry people would be fed and the problem would be solved.  Unfortunately, it's not that easy.  Removing tariffs and import dues doesn't just do that.  It allows huge foreign corporations to devastate an entire economy.  Let's say we have a small African economy.  There are many independent chicken farmers that produce food.  One year there is a climate change induced drought and the farms produce less which results in less food for the chickens which results in less food for everyone.  Now, if you were the president of that country you'd have to make a very hard choice.  Do you rely on international aid to help your starving people or do you allow private profit oriented companies to take over your economy?  The problem is that if you let in big foreign companies they will outcompete and destroy all local competition because they need lower profit margins, meaning that they can produce one product for cheaper because they mass produced it.  This could leave our small economy in the hands of a powerful monopoly which won't allow competition and could threaten the politicians if they enact a law that could endanger the profits of that company.  There would also be massive unemployment as all those chicken farmers are put out of business.  As you can see now there are many negative effects you could get from removing tariffs.  It's not just as simple as allowing huge western companies to give food to hungry people.  Critique 2.  Who cares if the market wastes resources as long as everyone still has food.  My first point is that not everyone has food which automatically makes this argument wrong.  However, even if we pretend that everyone was fed, I still disagree with the idea that a system which wastes one third of what it produces is a good system.  Overproduction is a waste of resources and as long as we overproduce that much, this is not the most efficient system there can be.  Critique 3.  Those who suffer deserve it.  It's not usually formulated like that, but it's a common argument.  It goes if poor people don't want to be poor anymore they should work hard and then they wouldn't have to starve.  This is an argument which could arguably, theoretically be correct for some people in some situations.  But someone born a chicken farmer in a poor African country won't have the ability to become rich like Elon Musk who got millions from his parents.  And even if poverty was 100% the fault of the person in poverty I still don't agree with the notion that anyone can deserve to starve.  We can easily provide for everyone even if they are unemployed and I think doing so would be our duty as humans.  We can feed everyone even if they made financial mistakes in the past.  Critique 4.  It's not the job of the market to serve everyone.  This is a rather common one for some reason.  The free market is a system of distribution we use around the world.  The job of the market is quite definitely to distribute resources to everyone who needs them.  In our theoretical example that was its purpose and that's what it did.  It's the purpose of the market to supply everyone and if it's not capable of doing that then we should begin to look for another system.  Critic 5.  What about the innovation the market brought to us?  There is a common belief amongst a lot of people that the free market causes innovation.  This is because, in another theoretical example, companies need to innovate in order to win against the competition.  For a variety of reasons that doesn't happen and most innovation is done by universities.  I made a whole video about this topic.  Link in the top right corner.  Critique 6.  The market lifted millions of people out of poverty.  I could reply to this in many ways.  I could for example flat out deny that this was the achievement of the market and point out that it was workers who produced the things that lifted those people out of poverty.  But let's not.  Let's assume the market did actually do that.  That doesn't change the fact that the market is inefficient.  And it doesn't change the fact that it could be improved.  Just because it brought us good things in the past doesn't mean that we have to keep it.  I mean, Hitler built most of the Autobahnen but that doesn't mean that we need to keep fascism to keep on profiting off them.  There are other ways to build roads than to use fascism and there are other ways to lift people out of poverty than the free market.  Critique 7.  The market is the best system we have, don't be a commie.  This is perhaps the most common critique of critiques of capitalism.  I'd like to clarify that critiquing capitalism doesn't make someone a Stalinist, a Marxist, a Leninist, a communist or even a socialist.  It just means that they're talking about the problems of the market.  I think we should be able to freely talk about the problems of the market without being accused of Stalinism.  This way we can figure out how to change it to make it better or how to replace it with a better system.  Hey, why don't you just make a better system?  This question is a very common attempt to shut down a debate on the failures of the market and it's a logical fallacy to assume that I need to be able to come up with a better global distribution system just because I am pointing out the flaws in the current one.  When I go to watch a bad movie I can point out that it was bad and what was bad about it without being forced to make a better one to prove that my critique was right.  The same is true for the market.  I shouldn't be forced to come up with a better system to be able to critique this one.  And even if I was I would still have to look at the faults of the system in order to know what to keep an eye on when creating another system.  So, in conclusion, we can say that the market is a lot less efficient than other systems would be.  There is enough food for 10 billion people and only 6.7 get enough food.  That's a waste of 33%.  Or one third.  While it's true that the market has many theoretical advantages over other systems, we have to admit that reality doesn't work like that.  And in reality it's often times more wasteful than we'd like to admit.  So, in my opinion, we have to acknowledge the problems in the system to find ways of fixing them or, if necessary, to replace it with a better system.  Thanks for watching.
