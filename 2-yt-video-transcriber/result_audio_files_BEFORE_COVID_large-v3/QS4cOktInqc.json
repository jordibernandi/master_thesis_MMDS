            "text": "I got to get a picture of this.  You got time to just tell me when.  Get ready.  There you go.  Oh, no.  No.  Now.  There you go.  I got a little bit of it anyway.  Oh, there's a baggy one.  You're going to get one, Brendan, and if you get a good one, I'll get one for you.  Your cats.  I got one ever, so here comes the start again.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Here it comes.  And why do they call it that?  Excuse me, but did they name it after Marie?  Just because that's what... Here it comes again.  There it is.  Girl, don't talk naked.  Uncle, you need to have some skills.  Greetings, family.  Welcome to the blowhole.  You just got a glimpse of it.  The wind is really strong right now.  Over on the right side, as you can see, water's really crashing hard against the rocks here.  You can see the mist from the ploho.  The ploho's on that side.  And the mist is simply, there it goes, there it goes.  Look at it, thick cloud of it.  Normally I go down there and walk on the ledge.  Right there.  All the woods.  Where you were just viewing.  Right now it's very rough.  It's very wet down there.  See if you can see that.  I really want to take a chance.  Slip.  Slip.  Really good.  And also a rogue wave could just come out of nowhere and just seem to grab you and throw you back out into the ocean.  You can see the evidence of that by looking at these, these waves coming in and crashing as they come back out.  We're on the far, far right over here.  There was a movie, I think it was with Burt Lancaster.  The movie was From Here to Eternity.  I want to show you the beach where Burt Lancaster and the actress were on that beach there.  In fact, one day my wife and I were laying there and she found a ring.  It was a diamond ring.  Interesting.  Beautiful beach.  Look at the violence.  Slip up that rock going out to the blowhole.  Look at that.  One day a young man went out there.  He came from California and he got in front of the blowhole because he wanted to put his chest in front of it.  Well, the water hit him, shot him up into the air, jumbled him, landed in a blowhole and he got sucked in underneath.  Well, as you can imagine, they found him a few days later.  Sadly, you know, he was dead.  You got to respect the ocean.  Never turn your back to it.  And always, always respect the ocean.  Look at everything before you make any decisions about getting in.  Whoa, look at that.  Oh, come on down here with me.  I'd like for you to see from here to Eternity Beach.  Right there.  Oh, sorry about that.  You know, welcome.  Each one.  Sure.  Very interesting beach.  A lot of people go up to the very top there.  Be careful.  Those rocks right there, they're dangerous.  Shouldn't take that chance.  What's interesting, if you come here right now on low tide, the way it's low, you see this right there?  It's a cave.  As long as it's low tide like it is right there, you can get in.  But if it's high tide, you don't want to mess with it.  It'll slam you in there.  Over here, turtles.  Right there.  Turtles will come in in this spot right there.  Feet.  Just sit there and watch them as they come up to you.  Over on the other side, there's another cave right there.  This cave actually goes all the way through the mountain.  And on the other side, because this is actually... An ancient crater.  There's a military base.  There's bunkers up there.  So welcome to the beach from here to eternity.  By the way, this is how you get down here.  Make sure you go up and down these steps like this.  These are natural rock formation.  And it takes you out in this area where you want to.  Do you want to lay out?  I personally like to get on top of this cliff right there and jump in.  Jump in.  Just be careful.  There's rocks.  And turtles.  Anyways, God bless you all.  Thank you for being with us once again.  I'm glad you could hear this ending part.  Aloha.  Aloha.  Bye-bye. ",
