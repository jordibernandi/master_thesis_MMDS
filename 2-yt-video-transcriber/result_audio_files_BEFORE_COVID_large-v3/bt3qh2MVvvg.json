            "text": "When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord, and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.  Acts 13, 48.  Calvinists understand this verse to mean that God unconditionally selected a particular number of Gentiles before the foundation of the world and is irresistibly changing their hearts to cause them to believe the apostles' teaching.  However, we believe that the Calvinists have brought in some presuppositions that are simply never established in this text.  I have added in the Calvinistic presuppositions to this text and highlighted them so that you can understand their perspective.  It would read like this, When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord, and all who were unconditionally appointed by God before the foundation of the world for eternal life  believed.\".  The first presupposition that Calvinists read into this text is that the appointment is made unconditionally, meaning that their morality is not taken into account, but also their faith is not taken into account.  The next presupposition that Calvinists add to this text is that the appointing is done by God unilaterally, without any regard to those who are being appointed, and that this appointment is made arbitrarily before the foundation of the world.  Arbitrarily simply means without any regard to the individual being chosen or appointed.  As has been said, a text without a context is a pretext for a proof text.  We first need to take a look at the wider historical context with regard to the nation of Israel in relation to the Gentiles in order to better understand the intention of the authors.  For instance, we see in Acts 18.6, they oppose Paul and become abusive when he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, speaking of the Israelites, your blood be on your own heads.  I'm innocent of it.  From now on, I will go to the Gentiles.  A similar parallel is seen in Acts 28, beginning in verse 27, when it says, For this people's heart, speaking of Israel, has become calloused, and they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes.  Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.  Therefore I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will  listen.\".  These verses perfectly parallel what's happening in Acts chapter 13, as reflected in verse 50 and 51.  But the Jewish leaders stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them, so they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them.  The historical context shows us that the Jews, generally speaking, have become calloused or hardened to the truth of God.  This is not a condition from birth, mind you, but a condition they have grown into after much rebellion.  The Gentiles, generally speaking, on the other hand, are more disposed to listen and to hear the truth of Jesus Christ.  After establishing the wider context, we can go to the more immediate context there in the chapter itself.  Let's begin at verse 44.  On the next Sabbath, almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.  When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy.  they began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.  Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly, We had to speak the word of God to you first.  Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.  For this is what the Lord has commanded us.  I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.  When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.  Notice that this text does not specifically say that these Gentiles are believing in God for the very first time.  but only that they are believing the truth about Jesus and their inclusion into the covenant by faith alone.  Many God-fearing Gentiles genuinely worship God and had not yet grown calloused in their religiosity of the Pharisaical teachings.  Remember, back in verse 16, Paul even references them as the Gentiles who worship God.  No one could rightly describe these God-fearing Gentiles as totally disabled, hardened God-haters in need of some sort of supernatural grace to effectuate their faith.  They already had faith in God.  They simply did not know about the Messiah at this time.  Cornelius, who we read about in Acts chapter 10, is a good example of one of these God-fearing Gentiles.  He and all his family were devout and God-fearing.  He gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.  One day, at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision.  He distinctly saw an angel of God who came to him and said, Cornelius.  Cornelius stared at him in fear.  What is it, Lord?  he asked.  The angel answered, Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.  Cornelius had not yet placed his faith in Jesus and received the Holy Spirit, but he did believe in God.  So one might say that God appointed Cornelius to eternal life.  How?  By sending him the gospel of Jesus Christ through the apostle Peter.  But notice that this appointing wouldn't be done arbitrarily before the creation of the world for some mysterious reason.  The angel tells him plainly why he's sending him the gospel.  Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.  So it is unconditional based upon his morality, because Cornelius is a sinner after all.  But it is conditioned upon his faith, his trust in God.  So we come to Acts chapter 13, and we see Gentiles who, like Cornelius, worship God, are learning about the truth of who Jesus was and their inclusion based upon faith, not upon works.  One might even say they are disposed towards, are inclined towards, are open to hear the truth being brought to them on this day.  In other words, they're willing to listen, unlike the Jews who have grown calloused and hardened to the gospel of Jesus Christ.  These worshiping Gentiles, much like Cornelius, are ready to receive the mystery of the gospel first being brought to light by the inspiration through the holy apostles.  A hotly debated point among Greek scholars is the use of the word appointed, or ordained, used here in verse 48.  Dr.  Bob Wilkins, a Ph.D. ",

            "text": "at Dallas Theological Seminary and Greek professor, explains, were told by luke after he had preached.  as many as have been appointed to eternal life believed as many people has been appointed to eternal life believe in calvinism said see these people believe because they were appointed to eternal life.  What people miss is that this sermon, which Paul had in Pisidia Antioch, Paul spoke of everlasting life before Acts 13, 48.  In verse 46, he said, \"...then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first, but since you reject it, since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, we turn to the  Gentiles.\".  Notice Paul says, you rejected the word of God and you judged yourselves unworthy of everlasting life.  That does not fit the doctrine of election as commonly taught.  Shouldn't Paul have said, well, because you were not elect, you couldn't believe?  That's not what he said.  He says you reject it.  And he says you judge yourselves.  He doesn't say God judged you unworthy of everlasting life.  You judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life.  So he turns to the Gentiles.  And when the Gentiles heard this, Acts 13, 48, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord.  And that's when we read, and as many as have been appointed to eternal life believe.  Well, the word appointed here is tetagmenoi.  And this word is a word that means in certain situations to put or to place troops in military terms.  And here it's used in the middle passive voice.  And so it could well mean something like, as many as had positioned themselves in relation to eternal life believed.  Or we could even loosely translate it, as many as were open to everlasting life believed.  The point is, when you go back to verse 46, whatever verse 48 is saying is antithetically parallel.  The people, the Jews in verse 46, rejected the promise of life.  They considered themselves unworthy of everlasting life.  The people in verse 48 accepted the word about everlasting life.  They judged themselves worthy of everlasting life.  And so when it says, as many as positioned themselves concerning everlasting life, or as many as were open concerning everlasting life believed, this is no conflict with John 3.16.  Whoever believes in him should not perish and have everlasting life. ",

            "text": "Now, even if you don't agree with that Greek scholar, and we were to concede that this appointing is done unilaterally by God, the Calvinist still has to establish that his appointing of these Gentiles was unconditional prior to creation.  And remember, that doesn't mean unconditional of their good or bad deeds.  It means unconditional of their faith.  Remember, the big debate of that day was whether God had actually included or grafted in barbarian sinners from nations other than Israel, irrespective of whether they keep the law or they're circumcised, but based upon their faith alone.  The biblical authors, and most especially Paul, go to great lengths to argue the case that the Gentiles were also appointed by God for eternal life.  If one takes a Calvinistic understanding of this text, then verse 46, when it speaks of the Jews rejecting the gospel, must be a reflection of God first rejecting them.  For example, Calvinistic pastor John Piper says, \"...notice it does not say that as many as believed were chosen to be ordained to eternal life.  The prior election of God is the reason some believed while others did  not.\".  Thus, on the Calvinistic interpretation of verse 46, God didn't really want the Jews of that day to come to faith and to be saved.  But is this consistent with the rest of what Scripture teaches us?  In Luke 19, verse 41 and 42, it says, Clearly, Jesus longed for the salvation of Jerusalem, but he reflects on the fact that they have grown hardened, and now it is being hidden from their eyes.  In Romans 10.21, Paul quotes from the Old Testament, saying, But concerning Israel, God says, All day long I've held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.  God longs to gather them.  Just as Jesus himself said, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often have I longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.  Or, as God said through the prophet Ezekiel, rid yourself of all the offenses you have committed and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O people of Israel?  For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.  Repent and live.  The Calvinistic presuppositions are simply not consistent with the whole counsel of God's Word, and therefore should be rejected.  Nothing in this text, nor any other that I have discovered, comes close to even suggesting that the appointing of these Gentiles was done arbitrarily by God before the creation of the world.  As Paul reminded Timothy, this is good and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.  For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people.
