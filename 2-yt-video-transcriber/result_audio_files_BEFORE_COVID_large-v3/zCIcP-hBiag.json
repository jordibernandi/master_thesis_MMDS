Greater than Hitler, greater than when the British attacked the White House in 1812.  Because this is not a threat coming from the outside.  This is an administration deliberately fulfilling Khrushchev's speech from 1956, weakening the country inside for the purposes of allowing it to be taken over.  Trump's been an idiot since, like, the 70s and 80s.  He killed my football league.  I hated him since that moment.  I have zero respect for the man, and he has zero respect for the Constitution.  He has no respect for the separation of powers and the checks and balances between the executive branch and the congressional branch, and even the Supreme Court, for that matter.  He has no respect for hearings or findings that come from courts all across the lands.  He has zero respect for the human beings in the United States.  My biggest complaint with the man, now I have a minor in political science, just so you know.  Had to read those wondrous documents a million times in my life.  As many times as I've read it, I keep reading the sentence that says, all men.  are created equally by their creator, following inalienable rights.
