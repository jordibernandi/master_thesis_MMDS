            "text": "We all know that on its own, his work does not capture the full measure of Joe Biden.  Folks don't just feel like they know Joe the politician, they feel like they know the person.  When Joe sticks up for the little guy, we hear the young boy who used to stand in front of the mirror, determined to vanquish a debilitating stutter.  When Joe talks to autoworkers whose livelihoods he helped save, we hear the son of a man who once lost his job.  When Joe talks about hope and opportunity for our children, we hear the father who rode the rails home every night so he could be there to tuck his kids into bed.  When Joe talks to Gold Star families who've lost a hero, we hear another father of an American veteran, somebody whose faith has been tested and who knows who to lean on to find the light, a resilient and loyal and humble servant.  And through his life, he has never once forgotten the values and the moral fiber that made him who he is.  The best part is he's nowhere close to finish.  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message.
