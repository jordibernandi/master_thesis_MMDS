I might be in this race, and you don't even know.  You could barely stand up the last election.  I don't think your health is strong enough for another round of me knocking you out.  You had help from Russia, Donald.  That's how you won.  Are you still on that, you sore loser?  My prediction, you will not be president much longer.  Is that a fact?  All right, well, let me ask these people running against me what they're going to do if they become president.  Go right ahead, jerk.  All right, Beto O'Rourke, what are you going to do if you become president?  Well, I'm not going to totally focus on weed, but inevitably, I'm just going to, like, screw everything up.  Not surprised by that answer at all.  Creepy Joe Biden, what are you going to do if you become president?  Well, I'm gonna make it legal to touch little girls.  Geez, I don't know why your ass is not in prison, huh?  Hey, Kamala Harris, what are you going to do if you become president?  Well, I'm going to do like everything Obama did, but I'm going to divide the country even more.  Not surprised at all by your answer.  Bernie Sanders, nobody's really expected too much out of you.  What are you going to do if you actually live to become president of the United States?  I'm going to give everything away for free.  Good luck with that one, dipstick.  Oh, shut up, Donald.  You just focus on not falling down, all right?  Cory Booker, what are you going to do if you become president?  Well, I'm gonna do like everything Obama did, but then I'm gonna do it like ten times better, you know what I'm saying?  No, I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.  Uh, Elizabeth Warren, what exactly are you gonna do if you become president?  Well, I'm gonna give a lot of attention to my reservation, but I'm also going to bring a lot of attention to Xbox Live, Mountain Dew, and Flamin' Hot Cheetos.  Jiminy Christmas, this is gonna be too easy.  Oh, pipe down, Donald.  What are you gonna do if you somehow win?  What am I gonna do when I win?  Well, I'm gonna keep doing what I've been doing.  I'm gonna make America great again.  But the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put your ass where it belongs.  Inside a freaking jail cell. ",
