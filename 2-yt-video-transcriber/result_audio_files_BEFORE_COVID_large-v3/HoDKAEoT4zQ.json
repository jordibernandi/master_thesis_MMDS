It's not incredibly new news, but the CC News Network has uncovered new shocking revelations about Catboygate that will undoubtedly shatter your freaking brain.  And answer everything.

You remind me of an ex of mine.  And tender, hot, griper-on-griper man love.  It included undeniably touching homoerotic moments, such as the two shopping for cute little matching jackets. ",

            "text": "And then it's... Brazen, disgusting, dirty lies.  But you know what?  When it comes to Catboy, I actually believe Nick.  I know it sounds crazy.  I mean, with the whole objectifying Catboy's juicy ass thing, his shul-shattering orgasm from that handjob, and the whole listening to Wham and saying penis thing.  But I've done some investigating.  And now, the truth can be revealed!  right after we thank our premium patrons on Patreon.  and we're back now.  as you know by now catboy is from australia.  now i took the liberty of doing an australian cat search on google.  you can try it.  this is exactly what you'll see now.  the first thing that you'll notice is that they are mostly tabbies.  remember that it's going to be important for later.  next i learned that there is a feral cat epidemic in australia.  they are overrun with them.  Now after learning that, I recalled several mentions of Catboy's mother.  Nick hates women.  But he thinks Catboy's mom is nice.  He's seen her.  He likes her.  And apparently, she's epic.  And then, while watching a video on Catboy's YouTube channel, everything clicked.  Remember the feral tabby cats?  Well, look at this.  That's not Catboy's cat.  That's Catboy's mother.  And Nick Fuentes isn't Catboy's lover.  He's Catboy's dad.  Listen to me.  It all makes sense.  Sure, they may seem similar ages, but cats age differently than humans.  Catboy is five or six years old tops.  And because no woman would possibly touch him, Fuentes journeyed all the way to Australia, knowing there was an abundance of feral cats and heat to fornicate with.  And, well, I'm just going to speak plainly.  He found one, and he raped it.  Look, I'm a cat.  I know these things.  There is simply no way in hell it would ever give consent.  It also makes sense because Catboy loves milk.  He can't get enough of it.  And he obviously has pica, which if you didn't know is a term used for the behavior that felines have when they eat non-food material.  And there he is eating an uno card.  He's half cat and he has pica.  And Fuentes' friends are into cats too.  Here's one of his closest buddies, Baked Alaska.  hitting on an underage cat.  Plus, Fuentes hates dogs. ",

And so, people, the reason why Nick Fuentes seems so loving and carefree with Catboy, and why he flew him out from Australia, took him shopping for clothes, bought him milkshakes, and treated him to video games, is because Fuentes is Catboy's dad!  Look, you've at least seen the trailer for Cats, right?  You know these freakish half-human half-cats exist.  Catboy just shaves.  That's all.  He is one of them.  And their magic, their mystery, their memory shall live forever. ",
