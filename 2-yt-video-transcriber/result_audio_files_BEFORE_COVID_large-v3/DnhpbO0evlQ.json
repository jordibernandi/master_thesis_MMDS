Now, this is the most important question for many of you out there who are still unsure or maybe even worried about buying Coca Tea online.  So, pay close attention.  Coca Tea is legal in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador and Chile.  However, its use is being discouraged in part by the Single Convention of United Nations.  This motion has been largely ignored by South America for many decades, and rightly so.  Similar to cannabis dispensaries, bong sales, and many other areas of international drug laws, coca leaf falls into a gray area.  Under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the entire coca plant is restricted outside of South America, but no American, Australian, Asian, Canadian, European, or English citizen has ever been charged for coca leaf use or possession.  The effects of coca leaf are very different than the drug cocaine.  The law is focused against cocaine, not coca leaf, especially not coca tea.  Over the last three years of importing and exporting coca leaf tea, we did not experience any legal problems.  This is highly likely to stay this way.

Will I test positive for cocaine after consuming coca tea?  This is a great question and also quite important.  While a saliva drug swab test for cocaine will test negative, this is the ones that police often use to drug test drivers on the street, a urine analysis will test positive.  CoQT consumption causes false positive urine cocaine test.  In a recent study, after drinking and chewing CoQT, 3 out of 5 of their study participants' samples remained positive for cocaine at 36 hours.  A study for problems of forensic sciences also found that participants who drank just one cup of coca tea screened positive for up to 36 hours.  Participants drinking two cups all remained positive at the 36-hour mark.  If you are regularly tested for drugs at work via urine analysis and not saliva swab tests, it's best not to consume coca tea during your working periods.
