            "text": "Mr.  President, the Lord would say to you, it is I who raises up kings and sets rulers on the throne.  As I lifted up Jehu to stand against evil and give his nation a reprieve and a window for the righteous and a chance for revival, so I have raised you up to be a Jehu to your nation.  and as i raised up cyrus to send forth a proclamation concerning jerusalem and my people in his first year of power in the 70th year of my nation so i raised you up and caused you to send forth a proclamation concerning jerusalem and my people in your first year of power and in the 70th year of my nation.  seek my will And all things that lead according to my ways.  be not moved by man, but only by my voice.  Stand with my people, and when you touch my nation and my land, do only what I have ordained in my word, for you are touching the apple of my eye.  If you do these things, my right hand will uphold you, and you will fulfill the purposes for which I have placed you in your mother's womb for such a time as  this.\".  we have come to the president's house this night at a time when the world rages against Israel's existence and against all who stand for the ways of God.  but people of God remember this for four thousand years the enemy and all hell have sought to wipe the children of Israel off the face of the earth.  The pharaohs tried to drive them into the sea.  The Assyrians tried to decimate them.  Babylon tried to obliterate them.  Rome tried to crush them.  Hitler tried to annihilate them.  Stalin tried to oppress them.  And the terrorists have sworn that they will destroy them from the earth.  But, but, but... The Pharaohs are gone.  The Assyrians have perished.  Babylon has fallen.  Rome has crumbled.  Hitler is gone.  Stalin is no more.  And the terrorists shall be no more.  But, but, but, the nation of Israel lives.  Am Yisrael Chai.  The nation of Israel lives because the God of Israel lives.  And the Messiah of Israel lives.  And the God of Israel is our God.  And so the people of God shall live and shall prevail and shall overcome in the end in the name of the star of Jacob, the light of the world, and the glory of his people, Israel. ",
