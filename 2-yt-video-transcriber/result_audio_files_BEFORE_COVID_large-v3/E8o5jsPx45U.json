            "text": "Welcome.  And today I'm just exploring some random topics.  I'm going to try an experimental video.  and if you haven't seen the latest global vision video right here must see fairy tale from sochi and a really fascinating video.  he talks about the meaning of this sochi opening ceremony and just really fascinating you know discussing the story of the history of our realm i think just slapping it right in front of us and a really amazing opening ceremony and I suggest you watch it and his depiction of it and I had a little different take But nevertheless, the story being very similar and very interesting, the Olympic rings and the fifth being disconnected and this seeming to be us and perhaps returning back from our separation from the rest of the realm.  And he also did a good job of breaking down movies and this being very reminiscent of the movie Ender's Game and of course Star Wars and everything else being tied into the truth, encoding messages in our movies.  And Sarah Tonin recently posted a video here and it was really interesting.  I mean seldom do we get a glimpse of the ruling hand or those in the know.  it seems like everything is done behind the curtain and here in this video she shares a link with another channel and I'm actually watching that video right now.  you see here the most important thing you've never heard and she shares an amazing website that seems very much in the know seeming to be a controller website speaking to other controllers in a very coded way.  if one were to stumble across this website without any frame of reference, it would make no sense.  But let's just have a little look at the opening statement.  This site serves as an official external communication vehicle for the World Governing Council in the Wet'n Upper Chamber.  If you've been directed here for instruction, note that most messages are intentionally obscure.  If you have difficulty understanding a particular message, you may reach out to the Luxembourg Cathedral on Node 9 of the Forgotten Frequency.  After authentication, you may receive additional instruction.  In the Upper Chamber, we often say, debate is required, respect dissent is allowed, and betrayal is death.  Bear this in mind as you read the instructions written.  By the time information is posted here, the debate is over and dissent has been noted.  Best regards, Somerset Belanoff.  So very interesting, and we see the fleur-de-lis right here, and all of these posts are just mind-blowing and very coded and worth an investigation.  But as I continue in this lady's video, she is now talking about, who is this person?  Well, let's have a little look.  Now, I've always expected this moment to arrive, when we would start looking at the controllers.  and things would begin to make a little bit more sense.  There'd be no purpose in discovering the controllers if we didn't know the backstory.  And I think 2019 was all about the backstory.  I think it's clear as could be.  And here we can have a little look at Somerset Belanoff.  Countess of Banbury.  She is the third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.  And she is also the current head of the World Governing Council, as well as the chief executive officer of the World Security Office.  Never heard of either of these administrations.  She sits unchallenged atop the Illuminati hierarchy.  and she rules with the iron fist.  She has consistently demonstrated a willingness to track down and destroy those hostile to her agenda.  Her motto is, debate is required, respectful dissent is allowed, betrayal is a death sentence.  Within the realm of world governance, there is no one who wields more power.  So this website is obviously not hers.  This seems to be whoishername.com.  And pretty heavy, and maybe a little bit late for me.  And I did explore this topic a little bit further.  And it was a little bit more than I want to share today.  It involved her family members, and we can easily see all of this in plain sight.  Everything is available.  Her daughter owns a restaurant in Los Angeles, and that's where it really got creepy.  And they serve something that I believe shouldn't be served.  and you could probably guess what that is.  and this lending to what type of people or not people these may be and i don't want to speculate too much.  and again it was just pretty unsettling research that i prefer to take a little pause from for a moment.  but again How could a restaurant like this even exist serving something that I wouldn't even think would be allowed?  And a lot of people have talked about our potential enemy in this realm and maybe who's behind resets or breeding programs with all these orphanages and really who's in control.  And I've often thought that what we see is beyond the abilities of mere men.  when I see our fellow men in this realm it seems like we don't get it as a whole and I don't think we're capable of such grand schemes barely figuring out where we exist and I think I'll just leave it there and here before I completely forget to share this with you all.  I'm going to show you this thumbnail by Roger at Mud Fossil University.  And I clicked on this, and it really had nothing to do with this thumbnail.  And I would have loved to explore this a little more.  If any of you know where this is, please let me know.  Or Roger, if you're listening.  really fascinating picture here and fascinating work as always but this just being something else.  our new world is.  the old world is what he's titled it and to touch on this a little bit let's look at another video by the sub photonic channel and here we can see A recent post, the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay Buildings.  And this was a really fascinating share.  Talk about evidence in plain sight.  The beaches revealing buildings all along the shore.  And what Jerry was showing.  was this coastline and clear.  back here what we can see is columns.  columns from old buildings and this is a poor picture.  I'll show you better pictures.  and this is clearly ancient ruins poking out on the edge of the shore.  and the more I researched this after watching Jerry's video the more obvious that it seems that this whole city has been completely buried either naturally or by tsunami.  and clearly this city has the same ammo as all others found in this plane hit by some great force and melting stone and then being completely buried.  And what we do see is the base of this Ritz-Carlton seeming to be the original work poking up and simply building this junk on top.  And this article was really fascinating because the Ritz-Carlton was being hit by a fine in California at Half Moon Bay.  a 1.6 million dollar fine Thursday for blocking public access to the local beach.  and I would encourage anybody to get over here as soon as possible And really, including myself, and have a look at these ruins poking out here on the edge of this hotel and golf course.  And the Ritz, you know, the Ritz, probably the owners are in the know, and not by accident.  that they're blocking this public access.  But nevertheless, if we read this article, which I'll link, and that's done now, ensures us that we have public access to this coastline.  And in fact, the Ritz is supposed to provide 25 parking stalls, 15 to 22 spaces, and 25 spaces in the hotel garage for public parking.  And they have not honored this and now have paid what is probably a small fine for such a large entity.  And the violations began soon after the hotel was built.  It'd be really interesting to dig into the construction of this hotel as, you know, it's going to be pretty recent where they're just building this top portion.  But maybe some photos would reveal much more and I did have a look on the Google Earth and it was pretty worthless as we can see here and clearly they are aware of this anomaly because we see perfect clarity with the building besides some warping here perfect clarity with the golf course and then smudging and this is where those columns would have been just right on the edge here as we saw in that last photo here and Google has done a number on this one no columns.  and yet when we look at pictures of this area every single picture shows those columns on the edge.  and there was another anomaly that I found over here.  let me zoom out so you can get a little reference to the hotel stream here this little ravine.  and just right over here it looks like we see even with the smudging of Google some remains poking out And it would be really cool to walk this coastline.  Some parts will not be accessible.  And maybe it'd be worth faking a game of golf just to get over here.  But a very fascinating find.  And really lending to the idea that golf courses, which I have mentioned in a past video, are really just a cover-up.  And it seemed obvious to me when I said that back in a video on Lake Connibus that I made up in Canada.  on a little island in Lake... We saw golf courses and ancient lions and it just made no sense.  And here we have really something lending to this.  We definitely see ruins and a golf course completely covering it.  And let's have a little look at some of these pictures.  And strangely, I had a whole list of things I wanted to talk about, and this being none of it.  But when something is fascinating, it seems to take precedence over all of our plans.  And here we can have a little look at these columns.  And here we can do a little search and get some better pictures.  Here's a pretty good one from the front.  And there we go.  This being one of the better depictions.  Absolutely mind-blowing.  And here we see a doorway and some access.  And it looks like a hole is caving in.  I'm surprised they haven't done something about that.  A golfer could fall in.  And right on the edge of this hotel.  And I would love to book a room for the night, only to get a better look at this.  And I always feel like when we discuss something, the countdown begins.  This may be one of the greatest archaeological finds in recent time.  And if we were to go into this passageway, as you just saw, it's already been smudged on Google.  There's no reason this would not have shown up.  But I believe if we went through here, we would have access to the city that existed here.  And just try to wrap your head around this.  And how far could this extend?  And really, when we look at the golf course, it seems like we do see traces now.  Small discolorations in the grass, perhaps lending to what is actually looming underneath.  And here again, a little look at the golf course from the air.  And like I said, every picture seems to show this major ruin.  And again, I encourage you to watch Subphotonics' video.  He goes into more depth.  I just wanted to bring it to your attention, an amazing find on his part.  And as far as this strange share, I'll continue my research and bring you more in an upcoming video.  But for now, I thank you so much for joining me, and do have a blessed day.  Please like, comment, and subscribe.  And strangely, I had a whole... ",
