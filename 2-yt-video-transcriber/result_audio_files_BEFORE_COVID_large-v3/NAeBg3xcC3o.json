            "text": "corrupt the minds of others around them who are too weak to think for themselves, says the Lord thy God this day.  I will not tolerate it anymore.  I am coming in now as the fierce lion of Judah, says the Lord thy God this day.  I am standing in front of my children and roaring with a whole army of lions behind me, my angelic army.  I am roaring and they will run and they will fall and they will wish they had never meddled in my affairs, that they had never touched my children, that they had never tried to hinder, that they had never indulged, that they had never blasphemed me openly.  For it is better to have a millstone hung around their neck and cast into the sea than than to cause these little ones to sin.  How dare they indulge them in darkness, says the Lord thy God this day.  How dare they?  So now I am coming to the defense of my people.  I am coming to the defense of the innocent.  I am coming in the middle of that storm And the roar that comes out of my mouth.  Is going to dissipate it.  Says the Lord thy God this day.  And is going to drive away the darkness.  And those people.  That fed off of my children.  Will be no more in their lives.  Says the Lord thy God this day.  Will be no more.  I am cutting the ties.  I am putting that separation in place.  Some for a season.  Others permanently.  And says the Lord thy God this day.  I am clipping and severing and burning with my holy fire.  Every tie that binds the wicked to my children, every tie that binds the corrupt to my children, it doesn't matter if it's a family member, says the Lord thy God this day.  They are my children first, not theirs.  Mine.  And I am going to make a statement that they are my children now and not theirs by separating them.  So they can have a new life and not have the same ball and chain and weights of the old family curses, the old family life, the old family line, the old relationships bound to them once again.  I did not free them to put them back in their grave clothes, says the Lord thy God this day.  I freed them.  To give them new life.  To give them new life.  And a new beginning.  And to give them life abundantly.  And a second chance to serve me.  Because I know who will yield when I give them a second chance as the Lord thy God this day.  They will not go back to the same grave.  They will not go back to the same grave.  For I have opened up that grave.  I have exhumed Lazarus.  I have raised what people thought was dead.  And I am making people anew.  Lazarus was a new man when he walked out of that grave, says the Lord thy God this day.  He was not the old man that was put in those grave clothes.  And I am building new men and new women.  And those that want to tamper and live in the old will not dare put a drop of that back on my children again.  For now it's the crossroads and I am making them go their separate ways in order to spare my children, in order to raise them up, and in order to give them a joyful life.  Not a life of toxicity because people want to entertain that toxic concoction blended by their families, And people around them and the enemy, my children shall not drink of that toxic potion anymore, says the Lord thy God this day.  They will drink of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit.  They will drink what is holy.  They will be filled to the brim with what is holy.  And the old and the tarnished and the corrupted are not going to like these new people because they will be nothing like them and unable to be controlled.  In this season, says the Lord thy God this day, I am breaking the controls.  The controls that people have used with wicked spirits of Jezebel and witchcraft to manipulate others and get high off of manipulating others.  I have smashed those controls, says the Lord thy God, this day, and they will not be brought back.  Thus sayeth the Lord in Jesus' name.  Praise you, Lord.  Oh, praise you, Lord.  Oh, glory be to God.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  Thank you, Lord.  Thank you, Jesus, for that word.  Pray for mercy, guys, for some of these people because we're going to see things now.  We're definitely going to see things.  God bless you.  I love you all.  I give glory to God for it is all him.  Keep the faith. ",
