            "text": "Howdy lieutenants and economists.  The most volatile, evil, disgusting things on the planet, humans.  If you have a video request, you can always go to assholeconsulting.com.  Yeah, I am gonna charge you kids.  And that is the importance of not fucking up.  You are such an asshole!  Got an interesting request here, so I gotta keep it a little bit anonymous.  But Zach writes, please do a response to this Sandman video.  He provides me the link here.  And someone had requested Sandman do a video on the saddest person Sandman has ever known.  And I listened to it and I tuned into some of Sandman's videos.  They're pretty good.  Check them out.  You just search Sandman on YouTube.  And interestingly enough, it is not the Metallica song that comes up first.  It's Sandman's videos.  And he was talking about a guy whose wife is 300 pounds, doubled her weight since she got married, is a hoarder.  I mean, it's just horrible, just horrible.  And the guy doesn't have the balls to say no.  And so Zach asked, who is the saddest person from your private life?  Who is the saddest person from your video clientele?  And I had to sit and really think about that because I've had some... really not there's definitely bad.  it's not the worst situation because that person um made the best of it.  it's actually an inspiring story where a person in the worst situation possible came out of it but where the person is sad that actually there's no one person but rather a group of people.  so when i talk about that don't think it's you it's a group of people actually.  But let's talk about the saddest person I know from my private life.  This is an old man now that I knew many years ago, and I still know to this day, who let pussy ruin his life.  And I'm not being cliche.  I'm not pandering to the red pill crowd.  I'm just telling you what it is.  This is the saddest person I know in my private life.  With this guy had everything.  Everything.  And he was just, he had to have that pussy.  And not love pussy or wife pussy.  He had to have new and young pussy.  And instead of, and it's just so tragic because there were so many aspects of this guy that was alpha.  This guy was an athlete.  He could kick my ass.  He could kick any guy's ass.  This guy was ripped at one time.  He is off-the-wall chart genius.  Made $200,000 a year 20 years ago.  I mean, but he, when it came to a woman, he has there not an ounce of alpha in him.  And I'm not going to identify how I knew, but there were times when I'm like, holy shit.  You can't tell people to shut up.  You can't lead.  He wouldn't lead.  He wouldn't say no.  He was a pushover.  Despite all these other alpha-like traits, he would let people run over him.  Anybody.  Not just women, but anybody.  So he got married.  Well, he was married.  To a single mom, of course.  Who brought a kid along, of course.  And then she divorced him.  Then he went and got a mail-order bride.  And it was quite some time ago.  And, you know... Everyone's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And this is back in the day where, you know, I think internet dating had just started and it was like a cat, like you could just shop through it.  It's like, well, don't you want to just fly over there and get some tail?  No, he had to marry the girl.  He had to have a hot young wife.  So he married this mail-order bride.  And she didn't tell him that she had a kid, which is, and this, I won't lie to you guys, it formulated my opinion about mail order brides that in general, it's a bad idea.  You know, 20 years ago, it was kind of like, well, it kind of makes sense.  And watching this guy just constantly get sacked as the quarterback by mail. ",
