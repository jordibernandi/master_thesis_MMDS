But the first thing, and often there is a sometimes decades lag between someone leaving one of these groups and figuring out, whoops, maybe that was a cult, and then that's the point they find me.  So I'm talking to people who self-identify as having been in a cult.  And really what, I think, there's two main things I do.  The first thing is to listen to their story.  How they want to tell it, how much they want to tell, and how long they want to tell it for.  And I sort of make a joke when I'm training therapists, I keep my jaw firmly closed.  So I don't do what happened to me when I went for therapy after I got out of my cult, the kind of, what? ",

I don't want to speak for your book, but one thing that I gleaned from Dr.  Stein's work was that if we use attachment theory to describe the disintegration of relational capacity within the cultic group, then we can use it to describe how a therapeutic pathway might form around.  and if that means finding people that knew you before you were in your cult life and getting to know them again, if it means seeking out friendships and relationships and group activities with people who have nothing to do with that particular social organization.  In my own personal story, healing thing for me.  And that didn't come through psychotherapy.  It came through getting out in the world and meeting other people and doing other things.  It's very difficult, however, to find guidance to do that.  Especially if you've been trained for 10 years, for 20 years, that your world of relational reality is like this.  These are the people that you can trust, and only these people.  I'm sorry that we won't get through all the questions, but I'll take some more. ",

You also need to finish the circle on this, which is that when it comes to PTSD and complex trauma in particular, it's very, very important to have somatic practices as well as talking practices.  And one of the most effective somatic therapies as an adjunct therapy.  That's the circle we need to join.  So one of the most effective, so you find trauma survivors in yoga classes over and over and over again because it's the thing that works.  I mean, I think we don't have very good support, I'm afraid.  I mean, I wish I could say something a bit more reassuring.  You know, our laws are not up to where they need to be and our social services are not up to where they need to be.  And, you know, this is the reality that we're dealing with and that why we need to try to raise awareness and get more resources to help people.  And, you know, this is a long-term problem and people like yourself are really, you know, the cold face suffering with this.  And, you know, I wish I could say there was more.  that that's the reality of what we're facing right now. ",

            "text": "I try to address that in the book by offering a strategy mainly targeted at yoga trainers and administrators and teachers, but I think it would also be generalizable.  that I've given it the acronym PRISM.  And the steps would be that when you're encountering a yoga service or a meditation or a mindfulness service organization, pause for a moment to consider that it might have many good things to offer and that it likely also has a hidden history of abuse.  Research that history of abuse.  I mean, that's getting easier and easier.  Almost any organization that you type into Google and then add the word abuse or scandal or crisis or assault or cult to, you're going to come up with some useful data.  So research would be next.  Investigate whether or not the harm has been mitigated or understood or... or addressed in any way, show how you are not, if you are hiring or you are contracting from the public sector, show how you are not going to import this abuse history into the service that you're contracting.  And then M is model engaged ethics.  self-regulation or stress reduction or any kind of wellness goal that the NHS might be interested in exploring is really great.  And when the service provider comes to you with their pitch, pause.  And say, yes, this looks good.  I also understand that it's marketing and traditionally, well not traditionally, but unfortunately, and global Buddhism marketing has often been a disguise for unacknowledged abuse histories.  so yeah the services that you're being offered are being marketed to you obviously and and in the cultures that they're coming from there have been you know there have been you know widespread problems.  so we Yeah, in meditation circles you want to look at the researcher Willoughby Brittain.  Have you heard of her?  Yeah, so the Dark Knight Project.  And she specifically researches people who've had adverse experiences in meditation.  And I'm not that familiar with her work, but I know she's studying experiences or altered states.  Anybody who is doing good research into the provocations of dissociative states is also going to be, I think, useful.  You know, did the peak experience, was it digestible to you?  Did it make you a better, you know, partner?  Did it improve your parenting?  Did it make you more functional in your life?  Or did it begin to restrict or contract your relationships and make you more dependent on the group?  That might be one thing to look at as well in terms of the after arc of coming down from that mountaintop. ",

Yeah, he's fantastic on the subject and his book will come out in the next couple of years I think.  but if you want to listen to his Bernstein and he has two episodes on it and they're fantastic.  Also his actual PhD thesis is open access on awe and fervor.  And he is specifically looking at adaptive versus maladaptive peak experiences and how it's really difficult to tell the difference between them in some circumstances because they're provoked in similar ways.  So yeah.  There's been a couple of moments in my cult recovery life that have been crucial.  One was reading the Guru Papers by Joel Kramer and Diana Allstead.  There were several more, but I think the last one, the last major one was coming across Stein's work on attachment theory.  And so I'm just personally And so that was really precious.  And I don't really have a closing remark except to come back.  When you gave your account, I could feel myself freeze.  And I didn't know what to say, and I still don't know what to say, and I just want to say that.  And I hope that gatherings like that, this begin to address the ongoing and critical social need for support for people who are in ongoing stress. ",
