Welcome to Apologia, where a former Christian takes a look at the claims of Christians.  If you're new to the channel, tap on the subscribe button for an alternate take on modern theology, creationism, and Christianity in the news.  You haven't seen much of our friend Eric Hovind here on Apologia of late, in part because his Creation Today ministry has been nearly silent on new content since the cancellation of the Bible Q&A podcast last December.  But recently, Eric has begun a series where he addresses one audience question per week, and one particular segment struck particularly close to home for me. ",

It was five or so years ago when I decided to seek scientific information to equip myself to defend my young earth beliefs.  And I came to accept the weight of the evidence of a 13.8 billion year old universe, a 4.5 billion year old earth, and that the explanation for the diversity of life on earth is biological evolution.  as you can imagine when i eventually shared this change of mind with my children it was a very emotionally confusing and stressful time for them particularly since their mother grandparents and other close family and friends continued to affirm the young earth position.  But their father, me, who taught them spiritual things as the Bible commands, was now an authority who suddenly disagreed with all the things he had initially taught them all their lives.  This tension continues in our relationship to this day.  It sounds like question writer Kelly was in a slightly different situation, where they came to believe young earth creation outside of their father's influence.  Nevertheless, I feel deep empathy for both Kelly and Kelly's father in this situation. ",

In part, this was because I'd been outed against my will.  So I was reacting to an ambush rather than thoughtfully crafting a message.  But also in part because I didn't understand that my new enthusiasm for the science I'd learned was coming across to my loved ones as condescension.  They felt that I now considered them intellectually inferior for holding their views.  This was absolutely not my intended message, nor in any way how I viewed them.  But regardless of my motive, insane is exactly how I made my loved ones feel.  I can't help but wonder if Kelly's father may have been similarly misunderstood.  That the surprise of the disagreement may have prompted a knee-jerk emotional reaction from him, rather than a more considered and thoughtful reaction that Kelly deserved.  I've learned well that it can be a significant mistake to attribute motives to someone else's words or actions based on how that action made me feel.  Words that hurt are not always intended to.  Kelly, it breaks my heart that this disagreement on the history of humanity caused you to feel disrespected by your father.  I fear and know that I did the same to my children and family.  And if any of them happen to be watching this video someday in the future, please allow me to say once again that I'm very sorry for my hurtful words and attitude.  I respect you and I love you.

But to your point, Eric, I watch your social media, and I know that you do face mockery and scorn for your claims.  My videos attempt to engage you calmly and on the basis of factual analysis, but when you put out ideas publicly, you will get a full spectrum of responses.  And for what it's worth, I think that mockery can have a place in public discourse.  Reducto ad absurdum is a recognized effective debate tactic, and seeing your own ideas made fun of can prompt introspection for some.  And sometimes people are just jerks.  Welcome to the internet.  That said, I would prefer that such mockery be contained to the ideas presented, and that hurtful mockery is an inappropriate choice for parents in their interactions with their children. ",

For example, I don't hold that the cosmos has ever been in a state of absolute nothing.  It appears that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.  And the more we learn about quantum physics, the more the philosophical concept of nothing seems impossible.  Further, the word creation unnecessarily begs the question of a creator.  Things emerge, and things are caused that have no creator and therefore are not creations.  When the rain falls, the petals that emerge are not creations.  I put the universe into such a category of things.  And it's possible.  Eric and I even disagree on the scope of everything.  He talks about time, space, and matter, but such things are within our universe.  What lies beyond our universe is currently beyond the scope of what we can know or measure.  speculation is mere speculation.  i don't believe that nothing created everything and kelly's father probably doesn't either and without a real valuable conversation we can't really know if you're going to seek to understand another person or even pretend to.  you shouldn't start assuming such things.
