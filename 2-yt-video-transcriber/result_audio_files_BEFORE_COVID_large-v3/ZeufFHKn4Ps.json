But I've actually really enjoyed not doing segments on people like Sam Harris.  But the way I want to frame this segment for you.  is especially if you're the type of person who comes to me and says, I like both of you, or hey, I understand that Sam promoting racism through the bell curve wasn't so hot, but he's amazing on atheism or neuroscience or whatever.  When I was... probably in the age bracket of people who really get into this stuff somewhere between like 18 and 22 i was a huge fan of this guy ken wilber who i actually still like.  i think he's really interesting and worth reading right wrote really interesting books on religion on science psychology.  he was super trendy in like the early aughts and late 90s and people like bill clinton loved him.  And I remember when he started writing, I was in college and he started writing more about things like politics, which I knew more about.  And I was like, oh, that's wrong.  Like you're messing up basic stuff here.  And then I thought to myself, wait, so if that's that sloppy, should I really be taking this guy's word when he writes about Newtonian physics, something which I know less than nothing about, or translations of Chinese Buddhist texts?  Maybe not.  Now, I still happen to think in his case that his theoretical models are actually super helpful and interesting.  I wish people were reading him instead of Jordan Peterson.  But I use that as a door to the Sam Harris clip.  Because I would invite you to entertain the possibility that if Sam Harris's analysis of politics in the 2020 \u2013 the ideal 2020 candidate is so both empirically disconnected from reality and such an obvious projection in fact of like pure identity politics would actually be the only way to describe this.  And so profoundly disconnected from.  I'm not talking moral, I'm talking just a strategic assessment of where the Democratic Party is and also what would be required to win back the types of voters that he alludes to in this segment.  Entertain the possibility that if he knows this little about politics.  maybe he's overselling himself a little bit on other areas that he speaks with such sort of projected grand authority on.  Here's Sam Harris a couple days ago on Joe Rogan talking about the ideal 2020 presidential candidate. ",

But in very recent history, and to be fair to Sam, I know his people are I'm extremely anxious about being fair to him.  Mike Bloomberg wasn't the presidential candidate, but in 2016, Michael Bloomberg was given a prime time speaking slot at the DNC to make precisely this argument that he made actual money himself and Trump was full of shit.  So this has already been highly publicly aired material.  In fact, that was the centerpiece of every public intervention that Michael Bloomberg had as one of the most prominent Hillary Clinton surrogates in the country.  Anyways, go ahead. ",

And definitely not someone who feels the need to pander to the far left on these identity politics issues.  I think identity politics is really going to be bad for us against Trump because So much of the country the crucial sliver of the country.  I mean you just have to ask yourself Who was it who voted for Obama and then or twice and then voted for Trump, right?  Those people aren't rate.  those people are sick of being called race and and the.  so what's happening on the left is around identity politics and all of these, I mean, it's not that race problem, it's not that transgender issues don't have to be worked out.  All of those are legit concerns, but the fact that that's the center of mass politically on the left in a nationwide election against someone like Trump, I just think that's an absolute recipe for disaster.

Now, those are legitimate concerns, but I mean, people are tired of hearing about it.  They're legitimate concerns, right?  But then it's like, okay, first of all, The empirical evidence on Trump to Obama to Trump voters are actually very complicated, and they're multivariable.  And the research, I think, from Sands actually indicates that because the electorate has been re-racialized in a certain way by Trump, that people who in 2012 held highly bigoted attitudes but weren't given a method through which to express that are now doing that because that message is being tailored to them.  Then, you know what?  I agree with Sam Harris.  I think that there are a segment of voters in geographically vital states who were bought in by Donald Trump's economic scam and sick of the Democratic Party portraying them on economic issues.  I think that that's, I still think that that stands and it stands certainly at the most geographically important point.  Now obviously, Those people are not just people that flip to Trump, white people that flip to Trump.  There's also the many, many, many, many, many, many African-American voters that just didn't vote.  And of course, Sam Harris isn't reading Malika Jabali or reading any polls and doesn't know any of it.  But what candidate do you think would be most primed to speak to and get those voters back who are worried about health care, deindustrialization and oligarchs ripping them off?  Oh, well, of course, a technocratic billionaire who says we can't afford Medicare for all and regularly undermines and speaks out against the most popular social programs in the country.  It's this is just the part.  And again, guys, you can look this up.  There is no polling today.  That indicates that there is a broad constituency for this.  If you look at politics in a grid, there's people on the right in the Republican Party who are far right on social issues and economic issues.  There's people in the Democratic Party who are left on economics and social.  And there's some people in the actual middle who I would say are actually not necessarily socially conservative, but they are socially moderate.  socially centrist, however you're defining that.  And they're with us on the banks and on Medicare for all and those issues.  And then there's this little tiny cluster that probably literally includes the green room of Morning Joe and Sam Harris of people who are like, you know, I don't hate gay people.  I'm pretty terrified of black people.  And I don't mind a Mart slightly paying a little bit more taxes because I'm incredibly wealthy, but I don't want a big social safety net.  That is the American elite.  There is no electoral base for it.  The only time maybe there was was in the mid 90s at the peak of the tech bubble.  And Bill Clinton also ran to the right on social issues.  Now, again, I know this is.  I'm sorry that I'm not speaking in thought experiments, but this is like actual political reality that he's wading into.  Add to it, there are plenty of people who are speaking out about the rights of transgender people and race because those are fundamental justice and equity issues of our time.  Nobody, even the most woke candidate and all the Democratic candidates that are viable are actually at least rhetorically on the same page on these rights issues.  Nobody, as a single Democratic candidate who's announced yet, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, I'm forgetting people, Julian Castro, did anybody, I hope, and I'm not sure, but I hope they all mentioned some type of serious equity agenda across the board in their campaign speeches.  Are any of them building a campaign around a Twitter hashtag on wokeness?  Is that happening for any candidate?  Yeah.  Anyone?  No.  What he's actually alluding to is that the Obama administration in the last couple of years changed the federal rule on transgender people rights.  And there was some backlash to that, although, again, empirically, if you actually break down the numbers, it did not cost the Democrats any votes.  The people that voted against it and were most freaked out about it were not in the pocket of voters anyways.  There was no backlash.  segment that you could actually measure of people that were like, oh, yeah, I was totally going to vote for Democrats, but because I'm so freaked out by sharing a bathroom with somebody or whatever the fuck else is going on in your head to actually motivate you to vote in such a ludicrous, fear based way that I flip my vote.  It's not empirically valid.  It's not empirically sound. ",

I think we can all agree that literal identity politics, as in I as a singular soul individual would like my personal biases represented in a candidate, I think we all could hold a check on.  So I understand why Sam Harris specifically wants a young Mike in his \u2013 of course, it being Sam Harris, we're still not even talking about a thing that actually exists.  But I understand why he would want something like that.  but it doesn't represent anything other than a small of other cluster of people who are already way over influential.  And let me just add one other thing.  He's alluding to there, and he actually, you know, he's talking about the left eating its own in another part of the clip.  And again, I think, you know, coming to the right place in the wrong way about some of the aspects of this culture that I certainly don't like.  But I think a big part of the problem with like, that culture he's talking about is hyper-literalism and a complete reduction of human beings to a one-dimensional variable, which is how Sam Harris got his start.  He's trying to cancel over a billion human beings on this fucking planet, which are Muslims.  And that's the commonality.  See, he's part, he manifested in a different way, but he's the same thought process that he's objecting to.  There's no nuance.  There's no terrain.  There's no empathy.  There's no room for adaptability.  There's no contextual circumstances.  There's nothing.  There's just.  I read this.  I don't like that.  That's it.
