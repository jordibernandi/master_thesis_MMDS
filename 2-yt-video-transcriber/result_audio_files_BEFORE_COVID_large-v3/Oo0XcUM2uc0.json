            "text": "What is going on everybody?  So it's almost Christmas 2019.  It is this easy to be jolly apparently.  But you may have noticed that there's a lot less Christmas parties this year and a lot more company conferences.  And the reason that they've actually ditched the Christmas party is because human resources are getting more and more overworked in January, the year after a Christmas party.  than ever before and they just don't want any controversies.  and unfortunately with the broadening of the term sexual harassment a lot more people are claiming to have been sexually harassed when by actual definition they weren't sexually harassed.  maybe someone said they looked nice in a dress when they did look nice in a dress and they were just trying to be nice and compliment them but they took that as sexual harassment.  for these reasons and many more a lot of men are saying well it's just not worth it for me to engage with intoxicated ladies that i work with at the office Christmas party, because I'm bound by company rules.  And when these people get intoxicated, that are not usually intoxicated in the office environment, then they may behave in a different way.  And for many of us, that's actually quite unpredictable.  And for that reason, a friend of mine and I have made up a little bit of a tongue in cheek song for you all.  Now, I just wanna put in a caveat here.  No, not all women behave badly at Christmas parties.  As you know, I work as a security guard and there's been a lot of Christmas parties that I've attended in recent times where people have been on their best behavior.  They behaved exemplary, both men and women.  But there's also been a lot of bad behavior.  And unfortunately, bad behavior by women often goes unpunished, whereas bad behavior by men is far more likely to A, be punished and B, if punished, punished more seriously than if it was a woman perpetrating the same behavior.  So without further ado, I'm going to get into this. ",

Then I steal a drunken kiss.  Men, you are in mortal danger when these thoughts get on with this.  Don't think you might have a go with this trash can dressed like Santa's hose.  Bet your balls turn blue.  this Christmas, you know I know, me too.  This year it's been snow in snow place, gender studies thoughts in vain.  Every other's Christmas party, their annual shout at getting laid.  When they wake and realize they're pumped and pumped, they'll start to cry.  Of course, believe whatever they say, because no woman ever lied.  Hit yourself this Christmas day, and just keep going your own way.  Then it's up to you.  This Christmas, you don't need no me too.
