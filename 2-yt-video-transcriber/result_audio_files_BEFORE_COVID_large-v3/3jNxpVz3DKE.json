            "text": "These videos are usually not what I make on my channel, but hell, if it helps someone out there, great.  You don't follow me on Instagram?  Let's stop the video for a second.  Why don't you do that?  I'll wait.  It's all good.  In today's world, there are several reasons why somebody would want to starch their jeans.  I personally am a person who practices it regularly.  And yeah, I fucking love it.  Maybe you're going on a date with one of your buddy's hot moms.  Gotta look good for that.  That Veronica Vaughn is one piece of ace.  I know from experience, dude.  You know what I mean?  No you don't.  Well, not me personally.  Maybe you work in the shit, the mud, and whatever else is out there on a daily basis and you don't want to fuck up your legs.  Maybe you grew up in a family like me where if your jeans weren't starched for Sunday church you would get the belt when you got home.  Nonetheless, stop giving your money to that little Asian lady down the street to start your jeans for you.  Guess what, you're probably paying 20 to 25 bucks every single time and you know what, she's out there living like a king because you can't figure it out.  She's probably going to the men's strip club in San Antonio too.  So I'm gonna teach you, it's a three step process, it's very simple but at the end of the day it's gonna save you a lot of time and it's honestly gonna make you look better.  First off, we've got spray starch and we've got regular starch.  I like regular starch, but here's the reason why.  I don't put it in the washer with the jeans or the shirts because... When you put it in there, a lot of water gets mixed with it and it makes them not that stiff.  So what I personally do is I buy spray starch, I pour the whole fucking thing out because honestly it's not, the spray starch isn't that great because they put water in it.  So what I do is I pour the whole thing out, I buy some regular starch and I pour that starch in, okay?  That's the first step, get your starch.  Second step, you need a good iron.  Well, that's one way to burn yourself.  What you wanna do is, I don't know, I mean, I think this one was 30 bucks, but it's a press, so it's really easy to press it down.  Then you need a pair of jeans.  I personally am an Ariat guy.  I think they're the best jeans out there, but you know, probably some people will disagree with me, okay?  So here's how you wanna fold your jeans getting ready to starch them.  You see the middle seam on those?  All you want to do is you want to put those together, make sure they're straight, and just fold them down the middle.  See that?  Nice and tight.  Now before you've even started this, obviously you've washed them and you've sprayed them with starch before you're even to this step.  Now, if you already sprayed them with starch 20 minutes ago, don't iron them yet.  Because guess what?  It's going to look like you've got a bunch of shit all over your pants.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, try it.  All you're going to do now is you're just going to fucking iron them.  Pretty simple, right?  But you want to make sure that all of the lines are lined up because you don't want to be that guy with the huge diagonal line.  All you're going to do is you're going to make sure that the pockets are lined up in the front.  And all you do is you just iron.  Maybe you can sing a song while you're doing it.  Maybe you can meditate, do some yoga, whatever it is.  But honestly, it's kind of nice.  It's kind of peaceful.  You just kind of relax.  But at the end of the day, when you put them on later, you're going to look like the fucking man.  Okay, so here's the end product.  A very nice starch pair of jeans.  Okay, now you're not done yet.  Don't get excited.  There's still a big step that most people don't do.  And a lot of people wonder why.  Well, I starched my pants and they don't look good after one night of out in the honky tonk sweating your ass off.  So here's how to get around that.  Move this out of the way so y'all can see this.  After you've, once again, washed them, sprayed them with starch, let them dry, ironed them, they're ready to go.  Now what you do is you spray them again.  Now the reason why you spray them again, and all you're doing here is you're spraying the creases.  The reason why you spray the creases is so they stay sharp.  So you don't need a lot, just a little bit.  Well, maybe a lot, depending on who you are.  But, son of a bitch.  This is how you get a tight crease on them.  Y'all can see I sprayed the entire jean, and then where the creases are, I sprayed them one more time.  Now, these jeans are going to stand up probably on their own.  But, you know, that's kind of how I like them.  All right, y'all.  It's been a real blessing showing y'all how to freaking start your dreams.  Figure it out.  Start doing it.  I'll tell you what.  The women out there, they're going to like you more for it.  When the storm rolls in, I'm gonna be ready.  Side piece of my head in case it gets heavy.  Like a cowboy kicking down doors and taking names.  John Wayne. ",
