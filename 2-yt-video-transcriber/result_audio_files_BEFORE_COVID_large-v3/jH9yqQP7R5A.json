That's according to sources on both the Republican and the Democratic side of the aisle, Hallie.  The Russia thing is just a big nothing, bro.  Really? ",

The Tennessee grandmother served more than 20 years in prison for a first-time nonviolent drug offense.  What would you say if he called you?  Oh, I would tell him, thank you, President Trump, for really seeing me, not just looking at some data about my crime, but actually looking at the person who I have become now and having faith that I deserve the second chance in life.  I just say thank you for this mercy.  And thank you very much.  Everybody, I'm grateful to be here today with members of the House and Senate who have poured their time and they really have their heart and energy into the crucial issue of prison reform.  These members have reached a bipartisan agreement.  Did I hear the word bipartisan?  Did I hear that word?  That's a nice word.  Bipartisan agreement on prison reform legislation known as the first step.  And that's what it is.  It's a first step, but it's a very big first step.  Today, I'm thrilled to announce my support for this bipartisan bill that will make our community safer and give former inmates a second chance at life after they have served their time.  So important.  Thank you.  In a few moments, I will sign an executive order launching a new White House opportunity.  This is a very big thing that Tim and I and everybody have been working on for a long time.  And Revitalization Council.  This council will coordinate efforts across the entire federal government to deliver jobs, investment, and growth to the communities that need it the most.

I've been with the president recently quite a bit.

It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.  those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law, and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law.  We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently, and lawfully to become immigrants in this country.  Look I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.  We have to send a clear message just because your child gets across the border that doesn't mean the child gets to stay.  illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple.  Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress on dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants who are here now and on rationalizing our system of legal immigration.  That's plain and simple and unavoidable.  When we use phrases like undocumented workers, we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combating illegal immigration, which the American people overwhelmingly oppose.
