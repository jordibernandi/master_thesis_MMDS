This came from a Daily Mail article, and I've just seen a video clip of Branson with his bleeding heart worn openly upon his chest.  Virgin Airways t-shirt.  The important thing about this is that even if you listen to their shtick, it has nothing to do with humanitarian aid at all.  It has to do with Richard Branson, and I'm not surprised by this, having bought the US saying, we have decided to take over Venezuela for whatever our reasons may be.  But it has nothing to do with the needs of the Venezuelan people.  It has nothing to do with democracy.  It has nothing to do with freedom.  And it has nothing to do with democracy.  I have friends who are in Caracas right now.  There is so far no civil war, no mayhem, no murder, no apparent dictatorship.  no mass imprisonment of opposition, no suppression of the press.  None of that is going on, even though that is the narrative that is being sold to the rest of us.  So we just need to back off, particularly Richard Branson, OK, and Peter Gabriel, my friend, please call me.  I want to talk to you about this because it's very easy to be led down a garden path that ends in regime change.  Do we really want Venezuela to turn into another Iraq or Syria or Libya?  I don't.  And neither do the Venezuelan people.  All right, I'll stop.  Until tomorrow.  Hello, Roger Waters. ",

We know that there's another side of the story that's been completely obfuscated from the elitist media circles.  And that essentially even includes some left media circles, unfortunately, as well.  Look, we know that this has been coming ever since, of course, 1999 when Hugo Chavez was democratically elected in Venezuela.  We know that the U.S.  empire and its cronies and its regime change proxy fronts, the Organization of American States, the Lima Group, all of these entities have been pushing for undemocratic democracy.  regime change efforts in Venezuela.  So you can go to the 2002 coup, where they ousted Hugo Chavez at the barrel of a gun, tried to privatize the national resources.  So they really revealed their hand then.  And they haven't stopped since.  I mean, we're talking about a leadership here that has a mass base of support.  We're talking about 6.2 million people, Chavistas, in the country that went out last year to vote for Maduro.  So, yeah, I mean, there are millions of people on the street, of course, protesting this, right, asking for the ouster of Maduro.  But you cannot ignore the millions of people also who are pro-Maduro, who are Chavista, who are building this base of the Bolivarian Revolution.  And they do not want to discard the gains, the widespread social gains that have been in place.  Look, we're talking about a guy, Juan Guaido.  80% of the country doesn't know who this guy is.  He just appointed himself president. ",
