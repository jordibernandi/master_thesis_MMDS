Cheryl, a pleasure to have you on.  I do want to get this father's story out because he did respond and we should give him the airtime as well.  He talked about how he has his own unique history, his father being murdered outside his home by a trespasser.  This father on the phone said that he had been robbed several times.  So his defense says, look, I was just taking the precautions that I took based on my history.  What is your reaction to that? ",

And so I just wonder, you know, we'll never know how many other times has he called the police on anyone of any ethnicity based on his lived history.  So, you know, this is the indignity that we as black people have to deal with on a regular basis.  And for him to Label this man as a trespasser based on what?  There was no foundation for that label.  And thank God officers didn't respond, as we've seen them do in the past, exacerbate a situation and wind up arresting Mr.  Wesley for interfering, which is a thing that happens once officers put hands on you for no good reason.  This could have gone sideways.  And he had his child with him.  If his father was really killed by someone, you'd think having his own child with him would have given him pause, right? ",

How many times have pedestrians and vehicles piggybacked, if you will, with someone in front of you, whether you're entering a building, whether you're driving into a gated community?  Oftentimes others will let you follow them in just as a courtesy.  So what was it about this man?  He wasn't disheveled.  He wasn't dirty.  He didn't look out of place other than the fact that he was a black man.  that made this white man think he didn't belong there and therefore was trespassing. ",

We've seen this happen at times.  universities where i think it was a black yale a graduate student as she was sleeping on the dorm sofa in a common area and a white student saw her didn't think she belonged there and and called the police.  um so talk to the fact that i mean this is seems to be a common experience in america.

I mean, everything is now subject to scrutiny.  And that's why you're starting to see laws being passed where people who do just what this... gentleman did call 911 and abuse it based on nothing are subject to now criminal liability.

But I tell you what, I think what should happen is when emergency services are diverted and officers have to come and respond to nonsense like this, in addition to everything else that's on the table, I think the person should be required to pay the salary of those officers, however many show up, that were diverted from real police services, and maybe the financial liability will cause people to think twice before they do that.  But right now, if there's no accountability, this is fun.  Let's do that again, right?  How do you deter it? ",
