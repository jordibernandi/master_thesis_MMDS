            "text": "Have you noticed a rise in Calvinistic resources over the last couple of decades?  Together for the Gospel, Linganair Ministries, Grace to You Ministries, the Gospel Coalition, Founders Ministry, Acts 29, Nine Marks, the list could go on and on.  Calvinists have multiplied and are continuing to multiply.  Even the New York Times picked up on this trend back in 2014, writing, evangelicals find themselves in the midst of a Calvinist revival.  You ever wonder why this is happening?  History tends to repeat itself.  Scholars have noticed that Calvinism has risen up in popularity about four times over the last 500 years, and every time it always dies back out.  Why?  Well, either because God ordained it, or the system just doesn't hold water theologically and logically.  Nevertheless, it's on the rise.  It's no wonder that one of the most popular questions I receive is, who are some scholars that do not adhere to Calvinistic doctrine?  Or, can you list some non-Calvinistic resources, such as study Bibles or commentaries?  Frankly, some people have gotten frustrated because it seems like everywhere they turn, Calvinists are answering questions, but the non-Calvinists are remaining relatively silent on the topic.  This is one of the reasons we started the podcast a few years ago.  With the rise of the popularity of Calvinism on the internet, we must begin to provide resources that are firm but yet cordial in answering the question from a non-Calvinistic perspective.  I've also produced two books on the subject, God's Provision for All, A Defense of God's Goodness, and The Potter's Promise, A Biblical Defense of Traditional Soteriology.  But who are you?  You may be asking.  Well, that's the problem.  I'm nobody.  So the question often is, who are the scholars?  Who are the notable folks?  People, you know, like C.S.  Lewis or A.W.  Tozer, Billy Graham, somebody I've actually heard of.  Yes, all of those are non-Calvinist, but there are so many more, way too many to list.  But today I do want to try to give you some scholars that can help you in your research.  New Testament scholars such as N.T.  Wright, Craig Keener, Anthony Thistleton, Ben Witherington, Grant Osborne, I. Howard Marshall, and way too many Southern Baptists to list them all, but I'll give you some resources from Southern Baptists as well.  A longtime theology professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dr.  James Leo Garrett,  Jr.,  has a two-volume systematic that I highly recommend.  You can still find it in print online.  Also, our friend, Dr.  David Allen at Southwestern, he has a couple of books on the Atonement, one called The Extent of the Atonement, which is over 800 pages, and this newer volume just called The Atonement is a little shorter if you're looking for something to get you started.  It's a great work.  And if you don't know Dr.  Adam Harwood, you need to get to know him.  He was my mentoring professor at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.  He's written a great work called The Spiritual Condition of Infants, which I highly recommend.  You can find it on Amazon.  He's also currently working on his own systematic, which I can't wait to get my hands on.  I recently asked Dr.  Harwood his recommendation for study Bibles.  He said this, Currently my practice is to read from Bibles with no notes, study notes, or even my own notations, so I keep a clear distinction in mind between those words that are inspired and those words that are commentary.  With that said, he continued, I have benefited from several study Bibles in the past, including the NIV Student Bible, the NIV Study Bible, and the Life Application Bible, especially for its discussion questions.  There are other study Bibles which would be consistent with a non-Calvinistic perspective, such as the Vines Expository Bible.  I too would gladly recommend Vine's Expository Bible.  It's great for pastors who are seeking a guide for expository preaching, as well as the layman who wants to go deeper in their Bible study.  I would also add to the list the Apologetics Study Bible with contributors like Chuck Colson, Robbie Zacharias, J.P.  Moreland, as well as Norman Geisler.  It's a really great work.  I asked another friend of mine, Pastor Ronnie Rogers, who is also a former Calvinist and has written a book on the subject called Does God Love All or  Some?,  This book is one of the best point-by-point refutations of Calvinism I've ever read.  And Ronnie also gave me a few recommendations I want to share with you.  He recommends the complete biblical library, the New Testament and Old Testament sets, 40 volumes.  I do not have this set, but I do have Logos, and I believe it does access this set as well.  And I've used some quotations from it, so I'd recommend this as well.  Pastor Ronnie also recommends the Word Pictures in the New Testament, six volumes by Robertson, which you can also find online, and an exposition of the Four Gospels, which is a four-volume set by Dr.  Herschel Hobbs.  I would also add to that list the People's New Testament by B.W.  Johnson.  It's a resource you can find online as well.  And then there's Dr.  Ken Wilson.  If you don't know who he is, you need to go back and listen to my two interviews with him.  He is the leading Augustinian scholar.  He has a dissertation that he wrote on the subject from Oxford.  He's also an orthopedic hand surgeon who knows several languages.  He's one of those smart guys.  He broke down his dissertation into this book called The Foundations of Augustinian Calvinism, which you got to have.  Now, I believe that Dr.  Ken Wilson's work conclusively shows that St.  Augustine was the first to introduce a more deterministic soteriology.  The early church authors that you see listed there on the screen all taught a doctrine of salvation.  that's more in line with what you hear on this broadcast.  Let me encourage you to go to sociology101.com and look at our beliefs page.  You will see several links there, along with a list that's ever-growing of scholars that did not hold to a Calvinistic worldview.  I hope that will help you in your studies.
