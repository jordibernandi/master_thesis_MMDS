Beginning in October, we will be having Friday night service here at the Oasis on the third Friday night of the month, though the first one is October the 18th.  We are calling these hub nights.  The hub is what connects the wheel to a vehicle that moves.  It's time to get moving.  And it's time to move into this region as the people of God that we are supposed to be.  And we'll be bringing in... The best speakers that I can find from our nation.  We will be hearing the present word of the Lord.  And then we're going to pray for this nation.  And we are going to pray for the elections coming up next year.  I believe it is vital that we do this.  It's going to be an awesome night of praise and worship.  Hearing the word of the Lord.  And... I believe that God is going to meet with us in a very, very special way.  The first one, again, October 18.  Come be a part of these very special Friday nights. ",
