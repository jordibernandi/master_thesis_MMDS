But there's another sense in which I would want to experience the pain, right?  I would rather experience the pain of someone dying, but it means you don't have to deal with a lot of grief like that.  You, you, you, you're not, you're not scared in most situations that most people would be scared in.  So you don't, you don't have to live in, in fear.  You, you, yeah, you don't get, you don't get anxiety when things are going wrong.  You're, You're generally the coolest headed person in any situation when things are going wrong.  And, you know, depending on what you're doing as a Christian, some of those things can actually be helpful.  Like I deal with Islam.  People say they're going to murder me and my family regularly and that they're going to torture me and rape my wife and all these things.  And it just doesn't scare me at all.

So again... You would probably not want to have the psychopathy.  You'd probably not want to have it.  But if you've got it, you might as well make the best of it that you can.
