            "text": "Hi, everyone.  I hope you're all having a wonderful 2020 so far.  Personally, mine has actually been really great.  I've been extremely productive.  I'm working on a new book.  It's about halfway finished, but that is the reason for my absence from YouTube over the past few weeks.  But more on that later.  The reason I wanted to make this video is because I recently came across a hilariously insane article titled The Dangerous Rise of Men Who Won't Date Woke Women.  I'm sure that most of you are already aware of the English actor and musician Lawrence Fox, who recently obliterated a feminist on BBC's Question Time when she accused him of having white privilege.  Anyhow, Laurence Fox happened to mention that he doesn't date woke women and that he had even broken up with a girl who had supported that one crazy 2019 Gillette advertisement that talked about the dangers of toxic masculinity.  I don't know how we ended up together, Laurence Fox said.  It was a very short relationship.  We were walking down the road and she was talking about how good the Gillette advert was.  I just looked at her and went, bye.  Sorry, I can't do this with you.  And now predictably the media is having a complete meltdown.  There's nothing funny about the things Fox or Wokey McWokeface, as he now wants to be known, is saying.  It's also not particularly sad.  It's dangerous.  He is just one very privileged man and as a result of said privilege has been given a platform and he has used that platform to legitimize a bigger backlash against diversity and progress which is unfolding every single day in less public corners of the internet.  Not wanting to date quote woke women, far from being laughable, is actually one of the more insidious aspects of it.  Spend an afternoon on any major dating app and you'll come across generally white men saying openly sexist and misogynistic things.  They might say, no psychos, or that they effing hate big eyebrows in their bios.  And by and large, they also tend to hold extremely right wing views and see themselves as victims of liberal thinking.  Okay, but what exactly is wrong with not wanting to date a psycho?  There legitimately are crazy people out there, obsessive people, stalkerish people, entitled people who are extremely selfish and bratty and just an overall nightmare to be around.  Not to mention, if we're being honest, there are plenty of women who brush men off for the exact same reason.  As for the eyebrows, I don't really know what to say.  aside from everybody has a type.  I mean, sure, the guy could have said it in a more charitable way, I suppose, but at the end of the day, You can't really control what you're attracted to, what you're not attracted to.  Some people really might just be totally put off by bushy eyebrows.  Also, the claim that these type of men exclusively or at least in general tend to hold extreme right-wing views is utter nonsense.  There are plenty of male leftist and feminist supporting types who have been accused of far worse.  Harvey Weinstein, for example.  It's gotten so bad that there's even a stereotype now about male feminists being creepy.  Left-wing men definitely don't have some kind of monopoly on being kind and moral.  Lastly, if I remember correctly, wasn't it the left who started this whole game of not wanting to date people with opposing political views?  I won't date people with right-wing views.  Conservatives are whining because no one wants to date them.  Why I dumped my conservative boyfriend.  Sorry to the left, I guess, but this is the bed that you guys made and you kind of now have to sleep in it.  Nobody really feels sorry for you.  You can't spend all these years saying, I'll never date right wing men.  Right wing men are racist, misogynistic, sexist, not even just right wing men, but anti-PC men. ",
