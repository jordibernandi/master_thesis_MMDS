First, I'm going to just walk around the temple grounds.  with the puppy who is ADA-certified service animal.  That is what he is.  He is my dog and he is ADA-certified.  He is my service animal.  Now if somebody would say something, where's that chimichanga who said something last time?  Bite his throat out.  Looks like they have some construction or something going on.

ADA certified PTSD service animal.  Check your laws.  He's trying to take my dog away from me.  And it's ADA certified.  And it's a service animal for my PTSD.  If you touch me, I'll scream assault.  Okay, I need you to leave the property.  Touch me and I'll scream assault.  Oh my gosh!  Unexpected day.  So I was just assaulted at the Los Angeles temple.  You saw the beginning part of it.  I've called the police.  The ambulance is on the way.  I'm bleeding as you can see here.  My legs have been scraped.  They forced me to the ground.  They broke my phone screen.  It's now completely shattered.  They kept it from me the entire time.  I was screaming for them to give me back my phone.  They walked me to the gate and I'm calling the police.  That's one of them right there.  There was two of them.  I don't know what he is.  He looks Polynesian or Hispanic.  He was one of the ones.  But the first one that grabbed me, he's wearing a blue shirt.  He was a little overweight.  And the police are on their way.  So that just happened.  I'm glad I started vlogging this vlog series and posting things on the internet daily so that this can be posted.  It's funny too, you saw exactly how the video started.  Here I was reading my scriptures, like, you know, I'm just gonna walk around the Temple grounds as a visitor.  Says, visitors welcome, I've got my ADA certified dog.  We don't wanna support that here.  And I was like, leave me alone, leave me alone.  And next thing I knew I was wrestled to the ground.  You see this on my leg?  That wasn't there before.  My dog was screaming.  I don't know where the blood came from.  He just came from the vet, so he's kind of sick.  So I'd like definitely a vet hospital bill to make sure that he's all right.  Anything wrong with him, I'd like to blame it on this.  I literally was forced to the ground with him in my arms.  They forced the phone from my hand while I was trying to record it.  had their hand around my neck the entire time.  And there was a group of like 10 people in white shirts who witnessed it.  There's also security cameras everywhere.  I'm like, last I checked, you can ask me to leave.  You can tell me maybe you don't approve of ADA-certified dogs, and you can call the police and say that I'm trespassing or whatever, but you cannot assault me.  That hurt, and I'm still bleeding.  I don't know exactly where the blood's coming from or how many.  This leg is also pretty badly scarred up, but... I'm pressing charges.  I was literally just assaulted at the Los Angeles, California temple for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by that man in the red, in the red, in the red turt.  And I recorded it all.  So they could try to create a narrative saying I was any kind of way, but I recorded the entire thing from the time I walked in to the time where I was assaulted to the ground by two men screaming for help while a bunch of people watched and did nothing.  I hope that's the ambulance.  I recorded the entire thing from start to finish.  Every word of it, so they can try to say what they will, but I recorded it.  And I'm suing for assault.  Yeah, for the assault!  They just assaulted me!  Yeah!  That's the other man right there, the one in the blue.  That's the other one right there.  They just assaulted me, and he's the first one that grabbed me.  He assaulted me, grabbed me by the neck, slammed me to the ground, and the other gentleman held me to the ground.  While they took my phone from me, it's now broken.  My screen is... Just log in, Simone.  So like I said, my phone is broken.  I have damaged an ambulance on its way.  My dog was screaming in pain.  There were multiple witnesses.  There are several security cameras.  They may try to create a different narrative, but I recorded the entire thing.  You saw me from the time I walked in to the time they assaulted me to now when I'm waiting for the ambulance and the police to come.  And I would like to press criminal charges because they literally assaulted me.  They can ask me to leave.  They can tell me I'm trespassing.  They can say, oh, we need to put up a sign for service animals.  But they cannot assault me.  Or they can, and I'll sue.  And post this on the internet to show what they do. ",
