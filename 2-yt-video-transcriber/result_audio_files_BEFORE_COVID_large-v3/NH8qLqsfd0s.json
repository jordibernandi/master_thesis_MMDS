Right in the middle of California, the part where I guess the narrative is California wants to be socialist.  It wants to be, I don't know, unpatriotic.  And it's put out that nothing like this ever goes on.  Well, this is right in the middle of California.  Just a very brief background on this.  I was coming back.  Leonard Pecani was picking me up at the airport, and we stopped on the way back to Temecula in Rainbow Oaks, California, to go to this really neat restaurant that I had never been to before that had this kind of old-town-era America.  ambience to it.  i loved it and the food was incredible and as well.  you know leonard and i were talking.  all of a sudden everyone started standing up and they played the star spangled banner and leonard and i looked at each other.  it's like this is so cool and so we stood up also and we decided that we were going to come back to do a remote on this because i do think this is breaking news.  this is in california And there's a whole lot more Patriots around all over not only the  U.S.,  but in California.  So don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  And way to go, Janelle and Duke Maples, who are the owners of Rainbow Oaks Restaurant in Rainbow, California.  Way to be a Patriot, folks. ",
