I'm broad daylight, wide open.  I have nothing to hide.  You like what you see?  You making me feel uncomfortable.  You feel like you're undressing me with your eyes right now.  That's me too now.  Me too.  I don't know.  Me too.  What's your name and your badge number?  First Amendment.  You ever heard of it?  Big Nick, South Florida Accountability.  I'm at the Port Everglades of Fort Lauderdale, coming out to conduct a First Amendment audit of the Port Everglades to see how they respect my right to record in public.  Broward County Sheriff's deputy there.  She's activated his body cam.  See if he's willing to make contact.  They gotta protect the corporation's oil.  Hey, sir.  How you doing?  All right.  What are you doing, sweetie?  I give you two guesses.  One of them is not walking on the moon.  Is this your vehicle?  No.  No?  Is there something we can help you with?  I don't remember calling and asking for help.  Okay.  All right.  Even if I was inside the port, I can do it.  Well, do you have business in the port?  You're welcome to come in.  Do you have business?  I don't need business as a taxpayer coming to my port.  I don't need business to come in there and view my port.  What would you like to do?  If I wanted to go inside, I would go inside.  What would you like to do?  But I'm out here.  Okay.  So, I don't understand why you were asking me those type of questions.  I was just curious.  It's not normal for people to come out here and video.  To who?  Who's not normal to who?  I've never seen that.  To photographers?  I've never seen that.  It's not normal to you?  Normally, guys.  I've never seen that.  Oh, but at first you said it's not normal.  Huh?  At first you said it's not normal.  It's not normal.  I can only speak for myself.  Okay.  It sounds like you were generalizing.  It's not normal for me to do that.  But it's normal to photographers.  Okay.  And the media.  Did you call for backup because I was taking pictures?  Because I saw you walking back and forth, turn on your body cam.  What's the name of your badge number?  Right there, Deputy Mackey.  Which one is it?  Is it right there or is it Deputy Mackey?  As you can see, my name is right here.  It's Deputy Mackey.  Okay.  So, as you can see, my name is right here, Deputy Mackey.  Turn on his body cam.  I'm just taking pictures of a publicly owned property.  That's all.  I don't understand anything.  Is there anything out here you'd like to see?  I mean, you keep looking me up and down.  It'll be rude if I look you up and down as a man.  You'll think I'm being perverted.  Actually, I wouldn't.  I don't know, man.  I really wouldn't.  Y'all got double standards.  I'm just a photographer.  You keep doing it.  Do it on camera.  I'm broad daylight, wide open.  I have nothing to hide.  You like what you see?  You're making me feel uncomfortable.  You feel like you're undressing me with your eyes right now.  Me too, now.  Me too.  I don't know.  Me too.  Every time I turn the camera where you up and down.  Absolutely not what that is.  Well, I don't know.  But, you know, we have eyes.  I have the right to look.  You have the right to be.  You absolutely do.  Okay.  But when you were looking, I didn't come approach you for looking.  You guys came and approached me for looking.  I didn't approach him when he was looking, but you guys approached me because I was looking.  What part of me look like I'm incapable of screaming for help if I need help?  I don't know.  I'm asking.  I can inquire.  Well, I tell you.  What's your name, Sergeant?  Wallen.  Wallen.  Badge number?  799.  And I didn't get your badge number, Mackie.  520.  Thank you.  Thank God.  That's called the walk of shame.  You got cars behind you, man.  You got cars behind you.  Pull over.  You gonna back up in the middle of the road?  Hey!  He can't back up like that in the middle of the road.  That's very dangerous, man.  That's crazy.  What is... Hey, look at this man still backing up oncoming traffic, Sergeant.  Sergeant, this man is backing up doing oncoming traffic.  It doesn't matter.  That's crazy.  There's no emergency.  It doesn't mean nothing because he has his lights on.  There's no emergency.  That's only in case of emergency.  If I was to do that drill, write me a ticket.  You got the right tickets and charge revenue.  If I was to do that, obey the traffic laws, man.  Because he has his emergency lights on.  There's no emergency.  Emergency light doesn't give him the right to randomly break the law.  Sergeant.  Sergeant.  Sergeant, can I have his name and his badge number to the officer, please?  I'm going to file a complaint about that.  What is his name and his badge number?  And you were right there.  You can't allow that just because you have one of these emergency lights.  There's no emergency.  Thank you.  Emergency license for emergencies, not to back up in the middle of the road because he wanted to talk to his friends.  Emergency is not constituted emergency, though.  You're still abusing emergency protocol.  You can't do that.  If I was to do that, you got to write me a ticket and charge me money, put points on my license.  We all have to be accountable in America.  All of us.  Guys don't like when we hold you guys accountable because we all know there's nothing we can do about it.  We can complain, but it won't go anywhere until the police stop policing the police.  That's crazy, man.  Right in front of a sergeant and it's okay because he wanted to come talk to the sergeant.  All right, guys, I'm going to sign off, but I got a feeling I'm going to be followed.  So if so, that bonus footage would be at the end of the video.  If not, Big Nick South Florida.  Accountability at Port Everglades.  Out.  Alright guys, so exiting out of the port, I had a feeling that I was going to be followed.  As you can see, the sheriff's deputy has pulled into that Chevron station there.  And is watching me.  So, I'm going to walk that way and I'm going to confront him.  If they're man enough or woman enough to talk with me.  All right, so they circled around in the service station.  I decided to walk the opposite way to see exactly if they're following me.  They circled around, came out, and now they're headed in the opposite direction.  That's them.  that's clearly violating traffic by coming out and blocking the lanes.  So we'll hang around just a little bit more.  All right guys, real quick.  I just wanted to show you my reference point, um, as to the officer that, uh, pulled into the sheriff's deputy that pulled into this, uh, service station here, Chevron to watch me.  Um, I believe what happened was the Sergeant from her point of vantage point was able to see me and had realized that I had made that deputy.  um that i knew what the deputy was doing.  so the deputy pulled into the uh service station pulled out stopped there um at the uh intersection there for a brief second before he crossed over into the turn signal and left.  um so the sergeant called him off.  uh because the sergeant uh from her vantage point can see that.  um i made the deputy following me so big nick south florida accountability Out.  Well, I spoke too fast.  As soon as I signed off and put the phone down, that same deputy made his way back past me, and now he's going back into the port.  He turned down the road I was just walking from, came off of this road with a direct entranceway into the port.  He turned off.  the road I was walking on there and came out through the back of this storage facility here to get back and to the way to get into the port.  Hey, Sergeant, I was going to leave, but if that deputy follows me, I stand here and record every license plate come through here and broadcast it on the Internet.  That deputy right there, I saw him three times.  Three times.  So please tell them I'm just recording the poor.  I don't have any bombs, any guns, any attack dogs, none of that.  But I don't want to be followed and intimidated because I stand here and record every license plate and put them on the internet.  When I walked there, he came down, he pulled into the service station, stopped there and watched me, came around, came out, went out that way.  When I was leaving, he just came back around, turned down that road to come through the back way to come in the lane he was already in.  That's following me.  And I don't appreciate that.  Well, from my point of view, from my point of view, that's following me.  And I just make sure they don't do that.  Because these people have nothing to do with it.  But I will broadcast their tags and I'll say Brown shares or deputies did it.  I'm telling you.  No, you caused me to do it.  You try to intimidate me so I do the same thing.  I don't appreciate being followed.  No, I'm not intimidating anything.  I'm exercising a free right.  I'm not intimidating anyone, but I just don't want to be followed.  All right.  Now I'm nervous because men like me are eight times more likely to be killed by police officers than anybody else.  Men like me are eight times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than any other people.  Because I'm eight times more likely to be killed by you.  By police.  Eight times more likely.  No, yes, yes, yes.  No, I didn't generalize that.  FBI statistics generalize that.  They said the black man is eight times more likely to be killed by police in America than any other race.  White men are killed.  Spanish men are killed as well.  But I'm eight times higher than they are.  And that's why I'm nervous.  All right, that's it.  I'm just going to hightail it out of here.  I don't think they're going to follow me.  Big Nick South Florida accountability.  I'm going to keep the camera pointed in that direction as if I'm recording, but I'm really ready to get out of here because I don't like being followed.  Thank you. ",
