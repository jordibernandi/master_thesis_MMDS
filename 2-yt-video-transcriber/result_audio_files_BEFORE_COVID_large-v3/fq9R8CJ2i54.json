            "text": "This video depicts an encounter between an individual and an Oklahoma City police officer.  During the video, the individual approaches the officer, claiming that the officer is asleep in his police car.  He makes contact with the officer, and there's some dialogue that ensues.  And during the encounter, the officer is refusing to identify himself by name.  And later in the video, the subject videos more of his police car, and then makes contact with the officer a second time.  During that second encounter, the officer takes the video camera from the officer before the video goes dark.  Shortly after that, the subject had left the scene and later calls 911.  Two officers responded and spoke with the subject, and they'd requested a supervisor to respond as well.  During that conversation, the individual decided he wanted to cancel the call and left the scene before a supervisor could arrive and speak with the subject.  So currently, we're working off of the video that was posted on the Internet.  We haven't had an official complaint filed from the individual, so we're kind of working this backwards right now just with what was posted on the Internet.  An administrative investigation is currently underway, and we're waiting for the outcome of that.  At this point, we have not received an official complaint from the individual. ",
