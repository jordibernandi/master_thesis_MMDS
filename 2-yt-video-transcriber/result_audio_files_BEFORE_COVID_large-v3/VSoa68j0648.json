            "text": "Jerry here.  so we've watched the Chinese dating shows probably at least six years off all of our lives.  today I wanted to bring a positive video for you guys.  I found a clip I don't remember how I stumbled on it of a good contestant.  yes this guy's pretty good.  it's fun to learn through people's failures.  in fact we probably learned more through people's failures than looking at their successes but I think this guy is worthy of analysis because he does a lot of good things.  also he's from hong kong and in light of all the stuff that's going on in hong kong let's make hong kong people look good for a little bit because their little city is becoming irrelevant and it's dying.  so let's go.  So this translation's not mine, so it's not completely correct, because my translation would be better.  But I will clarify one thing that she said, which is she used an expression that we've explored before, which is \u5b88\u4f4f\u5e26\u571f, which means... I sit by the tree trunk and I wait for the bunny.  That was not translated correctly.  They're not going to translate it that literally.  By the way, guys, I have a Chinese channel, a learned Chinese channel.  You can follow it here.  If I were the guy, I would say, are you calling me a bunny?  She's saying the way she approached love was kind of more passive.  In a way, she's like elf girl in five years.  Think about it like that.  Very passive.  Just wait for guys to come and kind of wait for Prince Charming and never find one.  Always find a reason to nitpick.  Man, the plastic surgery on her face.  It's a good lesson, man.  She's 28.  She's calling herself a leftover woman.  Girls, if getting married and having children are something that you want to do, don't wait too long because you wait too long, you're a leftover person.  I'm not saying that's an insult.  That's just facts.  You can interpret it, whatever.  Some people might be proud to be leftover because they can do whatever they want for the rest of their lives.  No responsibilities.  But she's desperate, man.  She's like, look, I can change for you.  And I used to be the type who would just wait around passively.  But now, I found the one, and I'll even change for you.  I think if he were smart, he would be like, okay, this is a walking mess right here.  She could not be a walking mess, but nine times out of ten, she is a walking mess.  I don't think if he were smart, he'd go for her.  Let's see what he does. ",

            "text": "So if he chooses that girl at the end, then she could reject him, right?  Because she hasn't indicated that she likes him.  Now, before we go forward, I want to say something funny, which is in America, when girls try to look pretty, they might show off their body.  But in China, probably in Korea too, the way to look pretty is to make your eyes look big.  She was purposely trying to make her eyes look big.  Like, you could just tell she was purposely opening up her eyes.  By the way, if you look at my eyes, my eyes have very weird folds.  It's like a family trait.  A lot of people on my mom's side of the family have this.  So I have weirdly folded eyes.  Now you guys know.  But if I try to go like that, look at that.  I look like a freaking crazy person.  Look at that.  Now he has a choice.  He's got the leftover woman.  or this woman that he initially liked but hasn't indicated that she likes him, and she looks high-maintenance, and she looks like she wants to be on the show for longer.  Usually there's two girls that like our contestants, so let's see who he picks. ",

            "text": "Actually, I didn't think she would like me because I was nervous and I didn't perform well, so I was very happy to be with her.  I think she is a person who loves life very much.  I like to be with people who have a life of love.  I just asked the question because I want to see whose smile is the most beautiful.  I already know. ",

            "text": "You see, this is what I'm talking about.  I've gotten some criticism, some flack for suggesting this, but you're not on there to necessarily find the love of your life.  Just find someone.  That's the whole point.  You don't know much about people on there.  You're not going to get to know their Myers-Briggs and their... tenure how they're gonna change etc.  you're on this dating show.  have some fun with it so he has the right mentality.  okay let me just go with the girl who's cute enough who i probably can build something with and we'll just give it a shot.  i'm calling him smart because this is how i would do it.  the two of them now can go to the aegean sea.  they can go to greece travel and have fun.  so what if they break up?  that's the way you gotta think like a hong konger.  it's about the money it's about the money.  there's two great things he said to her at the end.  he's like you seem like a person like to laugh a lot.  he's kind of projecting on her what he wants in her and if she likes him she'll probably live up to it.  right now there's a danger to that in the long run which is there's a little bit of being not who you are.  so if you're not a person who last night you're a more morose person maybe it's gonna bite you in the long run for a short vacation for what he's trying to get which is just a little vacation maybe a fling maybe something can come out of this.  that's long term.  this is perfect.  and on top of that i didn't show this in the beginning because i'm trying to keep this short he posed a really silly weird final question that made no sense and the host our bald host had to save him.  so this is his way of recovering just tying up the loose ends.  so there's no doubt in her mind that maybe she picked the wrong person and he's like yeah my whole point was to see who would be cringed out and just weirded out and laugh.  and you showed you had the prettiest smile.  it was a great recovery man.  he thought it through.  so tying up loose ends projecting onto people what you want them to be i'm not advocating that but this is something worth noting and then understanding the rules of the game, so to speak.  That's it, man.  I think this was a great little short exploration.  I welcome you guys to leave a comment and press a like, etc.  Talk to you guys soon.  Bye-bye. ",
