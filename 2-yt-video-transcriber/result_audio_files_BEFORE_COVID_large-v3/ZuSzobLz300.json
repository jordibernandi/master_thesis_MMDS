            "text": "Unless we create our own progressive media we have no chance of fighting against the rabid propaganda of an establishment that is absolutely efficient when it comes to brainwashing people.  You're not going to be able to create a new political reality without having a dramatically changed media ecology and Double Down News is part of that.  Double Down News is about empowering you and amplifying your voice.  It's about holding the powerful to account and punching up.  Never down or sideways.  Nobody is going to do this for us.  If you don't pay for the media you want, then you'll be sold the media that someone else wants you to see.  This is such an important project.  The guys behind it are pretty cool.  Big fan of them.  They're doing everything.  Filming, producing, editing, writing, doing all the website stuff, getting all the technical stuff done.  There's a lot of work in it.  On a tiny budget, Double Down has been achieving extraordinary things, reaching millions of viewers.  Breaking the media narrative that creates the fearful environment in which conflict flourishes.  They are not influenced by any corporate forces.  They don't take any adverts, they don't have any outside money.  My god, we do need an alternative news.  Please support their work, we need their voice, we need to have our voices, and you know a lot of people don't want our voices.  Over the next five years, we're going to need alternative voices more than ever before.  They face massive barriers in doing this stuff.  So, my message to our viewers is... I'd like to ask you to support the future of journalism.  Support Double Down on Patreon.  Support this vital stage of resistance.  Support Double Down News on Patreon.  Support Double Down News on Patreon.  Join Double Down News.  We need Double Down News.  And Double Down News need your dosh.  Here's 20 quid.  They're going to need it, but you're going to need them.  It is what will make the difference between success and failure for progressive movements across the world. ",
