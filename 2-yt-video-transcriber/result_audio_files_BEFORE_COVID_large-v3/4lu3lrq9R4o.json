Type 2 is a type of argument that you can address with just a little bit of a refresher on high school physics.  And type 3 is an argument that makes you stop and think, and sometimes you can really understand why the person making it has drawn the conclusion that they've come to.  And today I'm going to show you one of each argument, and I'm going to explain some of the stuff I had to learn in order to deal with type number 3.

And he's annoyed at me because I never actually in detail explain why the observations of Polaris cannot work on a flat Earth.  So, here we go.  So on this diagram x marks the axis of rotation and if we were to stand on the axis of rotation in the northern hemisphere and we were to look right above us at 90 degrees then as near as damn it Polaris will be right overhead.  Now what we know to be true through observation is if we move 111.3 kilometers south from the axis of rotation then the angle of Polaris will drop by one degree in the sky.  so now we're viewing at 89 degrees.  This gives us a right angle triangle and simple trigonometry tells us that if we want to calculate the distance to Polaris which is represented by what we call the opposite of the triangle, the blue line, then I take the tan of the angle and I times it by the adjacent which is the 111.3 kilometers and that gives us on a flat earth a distance to Polaris of 6376 kilometers.  Now the problem for Flat Earth begins when I start to move.  So here I have moved 45 lots of that 111.3 kilometres and now the viewing angle to Polaris is 45 degrees from the horizon.  But if I redo the maths then now Polaris must only be 5,008.5 kilometres away.  So Polaris must be in a different position for me than it was for the observer at 89 degrees.  And if I was to move 70 lots of that 111.3 kilometres until the viewing angle to Polaris was 20 degrees above the horizon, then tan of 20 degrees times the 7,791 kilometres I've moved puts Polaris at 2,835 kilometres away.  So in other words, wherever I am on the Earth, Polaris must be in a different position for me than from an observer at a different latitude. ",

Now, this is one of the better Flat Earth videos that I've seen, and it's still wrong, but I can understand why he comes to the conclusion he does, which is that rockets can't work in the vacuum of space, and they need Earth to push off.  Before we see the rest of his video, let's just refresh ourselves with Action Lab's video, where he proves beyond doubt that rockets do work in a vacuum.  Whoa!

Now, the faster the soda leaves the can, the bigger the momentum it's going to have, or the more soda that leaves the can within a single second, the more momentum it will have, which means the can will have more momentum and it will move faster in the opposite direction.

Although it explains why the air would leave the tube at a lower velocity, it doesn't really explain why there should be less recoil as the air leaves the bottle into the tube.  Something has to be slowing the air going from the bottle into the tube in order to reduce that force.  So I reached out to a couple of people. ",

This means that the air coming out of the bottle into the tube has to travel more slowly with a lower change of momentum, therefore producing a lower recoil. ",

So this guy's called The Rumpus and he's a really clever guy.  And although he didn't disagree with my take on what's going on in the bottle and the tube, he knows that there's a lot more that can be added.  So rather than take his explanation and make it my own, I've invited him onto my channel to do a two to three minute presentation of exactly what's going on inside that tube and why when the tube is there, the bottle rocket won't work.  I'll hold my hand up.  I couldn't fully debunk this one myself, but I've really, really enjoyed learning all these different things as I go along.  And I look forward to showing the rumpus's final explanation, hopefully in a week or so. ",

And my main channel, the bigger channel called Conspiracy Cats, I've linked in the description.  if you're not aware it exists.  Now, Conspiracy Cats is a little bit silly and a little bit less scientific.  And it has lots of silly bits in it.  Well, I'm opening up a third channel called The Conspiracy Cat, where I'm just going to put the best snippets of silly bits from Conspiracy Cat.  So anybody who wants to chuckle, anybody who wants to watch, for example, the A-Team clip from the last video or listen to the P1000 song, they're all just going to be placed on the Conspiracy Cat channel for people to watch in different playlists and just have a laugh to.  So nothing serious, just the silly stuff.  And perhaps some covers of my songs.  I've linked that in the description.  Check it out if you want to, and I'll start uploading videos on it very, very soon.  Up until then, I'll see you later. ",
