And that's why they call it the present.  Yeah, I've taken a little break from time traveling to provide everyone with a little update on how we're doing in the WPL standings.  As you may or may not know, we're in the World Pranking League now.  And I will say before I show these standings to you, we are in last place.  We're in third out of three.  But that means we're only two spots out of first and we are a second half team.  And are you seeing them now?  Yeah, you can see it's not great.  It's not ideal.  But as I explained to the executives, it could be worse.  We could have two points.  We could have one point.  Hell, we could have zero points.  And that would be really humiliating.  Anyways, we've got a great episode for you this week as it features the return of J.J.  McCartney plus a new segment with Matt Connerton and a great prank on our old nemesis Pete Vape.  First, though, you've got to wake up pretty early in the morning to prank Jesse Lee Peterson But if you do set your alarm and wake up early, it's actually quite easy because he's an absolute idiot.  And that's what we did this week.  We pranked him twice.  Check it out. ",
