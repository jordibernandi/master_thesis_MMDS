            "text": "Hi, I'm Dr.  Dave Janda.  Welcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings.  The goal of these briefings and my weekly radio show, Operation Freedom, is to provide you information.  the bought-off lamestream fake media will not touch.  You can join us live every Sunday from 2 to 5 Eastern.  It's free.  All you have to do is go to DaveJanda.com and go to the upper right-hand corner.  Hit the listen button.  We're there for you 2 to 5 Eastern every Sunday.  Great guests.  great analysis and information that will benefit you and put you ahead of the curve.  Today, I'd like to focus on President Trump setting the Comey table.  Now, I understand and I get it.  Many people were very disappointed that the Department of Justice decided that they're not gonna press charges and prosecution against former director of the FBI Comey under Obama, pressed charges against him for leaking to the media.  But before everybody gets depressed, let's go through this, the steps here, okay?  This came out from John Solomon on July 31st.  And there was some hope initially associated with it.  James Comey's next reckoning is imminent.  This time for leaking.  Now remember with Comey, he's a really bad guy.  He's a deep state player.  He's a black hat.  He's evil.  But he's not dumb.  He's not dumb.  He's a criminal.  Criminals can be some of the smartest people you'll ever come in contact with.  I can tell you as an orthopedic surgeon for 32 years, I did come in contact because when you take emergency room call, you meet some very interesting people.  And some of the smartest people I ever came in contact with were folks that could be considered criminals.  Comey's no different.  Despise him.  But if you're going to defeat your enemy, you have to understand your enemy and what they're really about.  He has a criminal mind.  From John Solomon, the Justice Department's chief watchdog, Inspector General, is preparing a damning report on James Comey's conduct in his final days as FBI director.  that likely will conclude he leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor after his own agency began looking into his feud with President Trump over the Russia probe.  Inspector General Michael Horowitz's team referred Comey for possible prosecution under the classified information protection laws.  But Department of Justice prosecutors working for Attorney General Barr reportedly have decided to decline prosecution.  Now, many people say, well, see, that just shows you that Barr is part of the deep state.  No.  It means that he could not get a prosecution on Comey on these lesser charges.  And if you, according to my friends who are prosecutors and very good at it, for a long period of time.  They say, you gotta come in with your strongest case first.  And if you come in with your weakest case and you lose, it taints your strongest case down the line.  Now, a couple of things.  Inspector General Michael Horowitz, I've taken a lot of grief for the last two years.  And so I have a number of other people where we've said, this guy's not playing for the deep state.  I know, he was appointed by Obama.  That doesn't mean he's a deep state player.  In fact, go to your search engine of your choice, type in Michael Horowitz testifying in front of Congress, listen to his testimonies in front of Congress.  And how he went after Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch for them trying to muzzle inspector generals, including himself.  He was not a friend of the deep state and still isn't.  And yes, he was the one who brought this information.  Now, remember, inspector generals cannot prosecute.  They can recommend for prosecution like he did with McCabe in the email issue.  And as he's doing now with Comey.  But he can't prosecute.  He has to turn this over to a prosecutor.  In addition, he can only look at an individual and their actions when they were employed by the government.  Once they step away from the government, or fired in Comey's case, or resign in some other people's cases, Inspector General can only go to that point where they leave the government, and then the prosecutor takes over.  Remember, Horowitz was the one who, during the Clinton email investigation, ended up putting in public view the Strzok page text.  And also, let's refer back to 294 of his previous report.  This guy was on target.  Under the heading, now listen, Hillary Clinton and Foundation Crime Against Children.  This is Horowitz.  He interviewed, his team interviewed a guy, an FBI agent by the name of Coleman.  FBI again.  Remember, Coleman's going to come into play here.  Coleman told us that he kept regularly took notes in a journal.  Coleman's notes from October 4th, 2016 contained the following entry.  Anthony Weiner, unrelated.  Weiner, texting 15-year-old, sexually explicit.  Then, Hillary Clinton and Foundation, crime against children.  His team, we asked Coleman about these notes and he told us that given their placement in his notebook, the notes would most likely represent information he was briefed on first thing in the morning by his subordinates in the criminal investigative division.  Coleman stated that he may have passed this information to other FBI executives.  Can you say Comey?  after the morning briefing with the director.  Comey told us that he did not recall the briefing by Coleman.  Imagine that.  This guy remembers everything according to his biography.  Reflected in his calendar.  We asked Comey if this briefing could have been the time in early October that he recalled being told about the connection between Hillary Clinton's emails and the Weiner investigation.  Here's what Comey stated.  Quote, now, go back to my video I did about Mueller and the Sicilian flu.  Another case of the Sicilian flu coming here, folks.  Here's what Comey said.  Quote, well... It's possible, about the connection between Hillary Clinton's emails and Anthony Weiner, well, it's possible, possible.  this is what's knocking around in the back of my head, but I really, well, see, I know the frailty of memory, Sicilian flu, Robert Mueller, from having done a lot of this work, at least in my memory, it's much more of an informal than a meeting about it, but it's possible.  As I said, he's a criminal.  And just at the right time, guess what he gets hit with, just like Mueller did, to try to extricate himself?  The Sicilian flu.  So this from the Conservative Treehouse, great website.  The IG criminal referral for the James Comey memo leaking was a carve-out sent to U.S.  Attorney John Huber.  Now, here again, when any of us have spoken about John Huber, we're saying, you, that's ridiculous.  He's not doing anything.  Stop.  Just as Horowitz isn't doing anything.  Stop.  You're not hearing it.  Because there are no leaks occurring associated with their investigations.  That's a good thing.  Because if there are leaks associated with investigation, it means that investigation is possibly tainted and not going to come to fruition.  The fact that Huber and Durham and Horowitz have been stone cold silent doesn't mean they're not doing anything.  It means there aren't any leakers in their midst, which really upsets the deep state.  Conservative Treehouse.  This is not the Inspector General report on Department of Justice and FBI FISA abuse, which is the big enchilada.  And that's where Comey's going to go down, by the way.  This is an IG report carved out of the larger investigation.  Then we heard about this on Zero Hedge.  According to my friends, the prosecutors, the details of this are extremely important.  Bought off lamestream fake media won't touch this.  Here we go.  Comey avoids Department of Justice prosecution on memo leaks.  FISA abuse still on the table.  And according to my sources, the prosecutors, this is the key.  The FISA abuse of which Comey signed off on the first fraudulent FISA.  That is a huge deal.  Prison time.  Former FBI Director James Comey will avoid prosecution after illegally leaking personal memos in the hopes of instigating the special counsel's investigation into the 2016 U.S.  election.  According to Solomon of the Hill, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz referred Comey for possible prosecution under laws governing the handling of classified information.  However, Attorney General William Barr has declined to prosecute as the Department of Justice does not believe they have enough evidence of Comey's intent.  This might be a little spin by Solomon.  According to my prosecutor sources, it's not so much intent.  That's not why they think they threw this out.  It comes down to the word negligence and gross negligence.  It's really important.  I know it's frustrating and it's a bunch of verbiage.  Gross negligence is what the statute is based on, not intent.  and not negligence.  So if you show that somebody was negligent, but not grossly negligent, those people will walk.  And the last thing we want is Comey to walk.  As I said, he's a criminal.  He's not stupid.  He's smart.  And he insulated himself.  And we're going to get into that because the fake media is not talking about that.  From the outset, it was reported and confirmed that U.S.  Attorney John Huber was assigned to Assistant Inspector General Michael Horowitz.  Huber's job was to stand by in the case.  the IG carved out a particular concern discovered during his investigation that might involve criminal conduct.  Earlier this week, Mack Whitaker, who was now retired but was the acting attorney general, said, quote, now listen, John Huber, the guy who's supposedly not doing anything, right?  John Huber is reviewing anything related to Comey's memos, this, listen, and the like, end quote.  And the like is the FISA abuse.  Now, Comey, as I said, insulated himself, right?  Nobody's talking about this, but this is why they couldn't prosecute him.  Listen, this is from two years ago, or actually about a year and a half ago, from the Washington Examiner.  Professor, Comey's friend, who's also his attorney, professor who leaked Comey memos to the media.  Like a good criminal, Comey knew the law.  He did not leak to the media himself.  He leaked to his friend, the professor, who's his attorney, who then leaked to the media.  So imagine in a courtroom, Mr.  Comey, who at the New York Times did you contact and read some of these parts of these memos to?  I never called the New York Times.  We never did.  No.  No.  Well, they're charging you with leaking to the New York Times.  Yeah, I know.  Poor me.  You see?  And nobody's talking about this.  Solomon didn't talk about this in his report.  Should have.  The professor who helped former FBI Director James Comey leak memos detailing his conversations with President Trump to the media has confirmed, now listen, he was a, quote, special government employee, end quote.  Comey not just leaked to his buddy, who's a professor, who's his attorney.  Comey gave him a special status, a job in the FBI.  He was a government employee.  He insulated his insulation.  Quote, this is this guy, Daniel Richman, the professor, Comey's attorney.  Quote, I did indeed have SGE status, special government employee status, with the Bureau.  Daniel Richman, a Columbia law professor and Comey's attorney, confirmed.  According to sources familiar with the situation, Comey tasked Richman with, quote, special projects, end quote.  Yeah, how about protecting his butt?  Yeah.  And he had security clearance and access to the building.  Additionally, Richmond was provided talking points detailing how the agency was managing the investigation into who?  Yeah.  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails.  Oh.  Richmond, you know, the ones that Comey couldn't remember that were tied to sexual exploitation of kids.  Yeah, right.  Richmond's status attracted the attention of lawmakers.  Representative Jim Jordan, good guy, said during an interview that details about Richmond's special FBI status initially were raised at a testimony before the House Oversight and Judiciary panels with Comey's former chief of staff, James Rubicki.  Quote, during that deposition, it was brought out that Daniel Richmond, the guy who information was leaked through to the New York Times, had this special FBI status called special government employee status where he could sort of come and go in the fbi.  jordan said adding quote.  it seems kind of interesting that the guy who comey leaks to is a good friend and his attorney who had this sort of unfettered access to the fbi and the special status.  end quote.  now look this is the bottom line with the prosecution.  any prosecution in particular.  now we're going to talk about comey.  did comey break the law?  You bet.  You bet.  But as my sources, the prosecutors, have told me, it's not so much if somebody broke the law.  It's can a prosecutor prove that, in this case, Comey broke the law that a judge or jury would determine was beyond a reasonable doubt?  beyond a reasonable doubt.  You don't want somebody to walk.  And especially on a lower charge, because that's going to take your charges down the line that are going to be more severe.  And in Comey's case, on the FISA abuse, which is a huge charge.  Bottom line, Comey insulated himself.  He didn't leak the memos to the press.  He leaked them to this intermediary, his buddy, the professor, his attorney.  who then read portions of the memos, of some of the memos, to the press.  Now look, if Comey had, let's say, five memos and he leaked all five to the press himself, that would be considered gross negligence.  But according to the prosecutors I've spoken to, because he leaked to this intermediary and the intermediary only read a portion of some of the memos to the press and not the entirety of each memo and not all the memos, that meant that Comey was selective, that he was discriminating in what he was giving to his intermediary who was leaking to the press.  And because he was discriminating and selective, that is not considered gross negligence.  Is it negligence?  Yes.  Is it gross negligence, which the law states?  It is not.  And that is the reason why he was not prosecuted.  Period.  It's not because Bill Barr doesn't have guts or the prosecutors don't have guts.  It's they didn't want to press a case where they thought they would lose and then it would paint Comey as the victim and all his other charges, which are more heinous, would then be just dispelled and pushed away.  They're going with their biggest case first and this is not their biggest case.  So to all those trolls that are trying to fill your head that the rule of law has been completely violated on this case.  I understand your frustration.  Do I want him prosecuted?  You bet.  I want him prosecuted for jaywalking.  I can't stand this guy.  But the bottom line is we want him in prison.  And we want Brennan and Clapper in prison.  And we want, if that means Obama and Clinton, if they violated the law, in prison.  But we want the T's crossed and the I's dotted.  And we don't want anybody to get out on a technicality, period.
