            "text": "What do spiritualists believe?  Spiritualism rose in upstate New York in the 1840s.  This region was believed to have favor with God, and where direct communication with God was possible, as with Joseph Smith, prophet of the Mormon Church.  Modern spiritualists look back to 1848 as the beginning of their movement, when Kate and Margaret Fox of Hydesville, New York, first made the claim that they had communicated with the departed.  Demonstrating this communication to others via knocking and rapping sounds, the Fox sisters soon became local celebrities.  The remaining decades of the 19th century saw many spiritualists and trance-medium lecturers who travelled the country, convincing the masses that they were conduits through which the spirit spoke.  Despite the obvious exploitation of the spiritualist craze by money-seeking opportunists, spiritualism continued to grow its converts.  The movement blazed across the world in the early 20th century, where it flourished in many European countries, especially the United Kingdom.  As well as church services, spiritualists held seances and trance lectures.  There were even camp meetings with thousands of attendees.  French educator Alan Kardec was the first of the movement's followers to streamline spiritualism's belief system.  His books and writings are now considered almost sacred texts to spiritualists.  In the 1920s the church was formally organized adopting liturgy similar to Christian churches and seven principles.  1.  The fatherhood of God.  2.  The brotherhood of man.  3.  The communion of spirits and the ministry of angels.  4.  The continuous existence of the human soul.  5.  Personal responsibility.  6.  Compensation and retribution hereafter for all good and evil deeds done on earth.  And 7.  Eternal progress open to every human soul.  Spiritualists believe spirits of the dead are more advanced than earthly humans, having continued to evolve in the afterlife.  This is why spirits are looked to for knowledge, advice, and comfort.  A typical spiritualist church service today will include prayers, invocation of spirits, hymns, and then interaction with a spirit medium, who may approach individual members of the congregation with messages from the beyond.  Well-known spiritualists include Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, Edvard Munch, Norwegian painter famous for The Scream, Queen Victoria, who reigned as Queen of the United Kingdom from 1838 until her death in 1901, and who was reported to consult with mediums, and Harry Houdini, famed magician and escape artist who eventually campaigned against spiritualism, exposing many mediums as fakes.
