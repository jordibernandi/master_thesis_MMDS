            "text": "Hello everyone, my name is Jennifer Molesky.  This is my YouTube channel.  Ladies, guess what?  Men are going their own way, and it's a problem!  All right, so some of you have already heard about the MGTOW movement, Men Going Their Own Way.  And you can think what you want about it, but this is a really big problem for women, for us, for our future, for families, for you to find a partner.  If a population of good men are walking away because they're fed up with women.  Now, to be clear, it's not women in general.  It's the mass of women that are taking over the culture and representing women.  They're loud.  They're mean.  They say they want equality.  If modern feminists really want equality, why are they not protesting in the streets for changing the laws for alimony or child support or child custody.  Because they don't want equality.  They want superiority.  And they're not getting it.  men are.  not only are men going their own way as far as relationships, like you're not going to be able to find a good partner because they're fucking off, but also because women have become such cry babies that a man can't even speak to them, mentor them, help them, coach them, guide them, be in a room alone with them for fear that that they will say that there was sexual harassment.  Women have become so sensitive and, and that, and that's what it is.  It's a superiority thing.  I have, I have a theory.  Have you ever met a woman who bitches about being cat called?  Okay.  So there was a, there was an article in, in this newspaper called the independent here, and it's very left wing.  And there was an article.  Oh my God.  about a woman who lived downtown, and she was complaining that she couldn't, on a daily basis, she couldn't leave her house because men were catcalling her, saying rude things to her.  She claimed that one guy followed her and said something about wanting to fuck her, and then she was like, leave me alone.  So he threw a pop at her.  Bullshit.  I have been out in this town for 16 years.  I have never had anything thrown at me.  I've only been treated respectfully, but I will say this.  I have a very playful nature and I'm really secure in who I am.  Okay.  So there, there's been times that like construction sites where I've, I've like walked by.  I remember I was at the bank and I got on my car to go into the bank and there was somebody on a scaffold and he said something like, hey girl or look good or something and it didn't bother.  i wasn't offended i didn't see it as harassment i didn't fear for my safety i didn't think it was out of line i didn't think it was rude i didn't feel victimized.  i was like hey thanks.  and then they all like waved and they got back to doing whatever it was that they're doing.  but there are women out there.  okay so this is my theory.  i'm going to get back to it.  i think that there's women out there who don't feel actually good about themselves.  They don't feel attractive.  They don't feel strong.  They don't feel secure in their body.  So they're fishing, they're fishing for compliments or slash.  They want people to think that they're better than they are.  Here's what I mean.  The women, and I asked you originally, do you, have you ever met a woman who has said, Oh my God, on the way to work today, this guy was like, Hey, how's your day?  I like your dress.  I'm like, God, you know, and they complain like this.  I think they're telling people that so they can prove to you that, that they're, they're pretty or their dress is nice, or they're just, they're so beautiful and they're so wonderful.  You don't even know how hard it is to be out in the world, but it's not, it's not hard.  It's, it's not hard.  Okay.  I don't want to go off on that too much, but, but there's women like that.  And because there are so many women like that who don't understand their value, possibly because they have little value, uh, they haven't cultivated anything genuine in, in their intellect in their in their hearts in their demeanor in their appearance.  they haven't cultivated.  they haven't cultivated anything.  so they feel low.  so they want to be higher than men.  and men are smelling.  that smells bad smells bad.  so now men are saying i'm not going to mentor a woman.  you know i i'm a fine dining server as my job because no one gives me donations.  but you know that's okay here on YouTube.  I might get there.  But anyway, I love waiting tables.  Um, and I was waiting on like a 10 top.  That means 10 people.  And they were older and they were wealthy and they were white.  So they are like the devil.  They weren't the devil.  They're awesome.  But he was saying he being an owner of a big company, uh, was saying to his friends at our annual Christmas party that he hosts and pays for, he's like, I'll go, but I only shake hands and I don't hug women anymore.  And he said a lot of his female employees would be like, hey, Bob, let's say his name's Bob.  Hey, Bob, and try to give him a hug.  He's like, no, no, no, no.  Like, oh, like, what the hell?  He's like, no, but it's good to see you.  So men are even afraid to hug, maybe as they should be.  I was talking to another old white guy at the restaurant that I work at, and he said that there was, oh yeah, there was a girl who knocked on his door like a while ago and said, sir, can I please use your bathroom?  And he said, no.  Of course he said no.  To have a girl in the house of an old white man?  You're looking, you are looking to be absolutely accused of something.  So what, what this modern feminism is doing is causing men to say, I'm out.  No, you can't use my bathroom.  No, I don't want to mentor you.  No, I don't want to hug you.  No, I don't want to be in a room alone with you.  Even if it's for, um, What's it called?  An assessment?  You know, so now they have to have more people in or video cameras.  So it's all for the safety of women.  But I thought women were so powerful.  So we're doing all these things to help women feel safe, even though they're so powerful and they're equal to men.  What did I start talking about this?  Women, women, this is a problem.  So what's the solution?  Well, ditch modern feminism.  If you're so strong, act like it.  Be on the side of men.  Stand up to bully women.  Don't be a bully woman yourself.  You know what else I would say, maybe as advice, is befriend people who are against feminism.  I know, I know, it's bold and scary and fuck those people, but... I think you could learn a lot from the view because you were in a bubble right now thinking that you're oppressed and you are oppressing.  You're choosing, you're making people, you're causing, I hate making because it's a choice.  You're, you're having people choose.  No, you are giving, leaving you alone as the better option than engaging with you in any way.  And that's absolutely fucking over society.  And family and values.  And do you know how good it is to be in a nurturing relationship?  It's fantastic.  But you're not going to get that by being a part of a culture that is... is a protected class, not an equal class.  You want protection.  You don't want equality.  You want to be better.  It's demonic.  It's demonic.  Now, after you hate me, you should subscribe to my channel because... it's fun to hate me.  A lot of people do.  So join, join, and maybe I can change your mind.  Even a couple percentage points to be like, Oh, well maybe she's right about this one thing.  This one thing.  Okay.  That's it.  Share this video or something or hate me or dislike it, whatever.  I don't care. ",
