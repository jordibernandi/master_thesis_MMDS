That was Bill Johnson of Bethel Church in Redding, California, reading from the Passion Translation, the work of one single person by the name of Brian Simmons.  Now, I use air quotes because the Passion Bible is not a translation at all.  It's not even a paraphrase.  The Passion Translation is a man-inspired work meant to promote a false and dangerous movement called the New Apostolic Reformation.  Now, there are major errors within this movement, not the least of which is the teaching that the office of Apostle, with a capital A, has been reestablished by God, and that these apostles are now giving new revelation from God.  Bill Johnson is recognized as an apostle in this movement.  This is one of the responsibilities of apostles, such as those whom you see on the platform, is following Paul's example by inviting to the platform three apostolic pillars of today's church.  Cheyenne of Pasadena, California, Bill Johnson of Reading, California, and John Arnott of Toronto, Canada.  I have a question.

            "text": "But adding to the scripture is exactly what Brian does with his humanly inspired embellished fantasy called the Passion Translation.  Remember I mentioned the word impartation?  The NAR teaches a transferable impartation or anointing that could be passed on by the laying on of hands.  They also teach an impartation of spiritual gifts by the laying on of hands, such as tongues and other gifts as well.  Now, keep that in mind as I read 1 Corinthians 3, verses 8 through 11.  First, from the New American Standard Bible, which is a word-for-word, as literal as possible, translation from the Greek.  The context of this passage is the greater glory of the new covenant over the old.  We read there, \"...but if the ministry of death in letters engraved on stone came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading as it was, how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with  glory?\".  For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.  For indeed, what had glory, in this case, has no glory because of the glory that surpassed it.  For if that which fades away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.  But in the Passion translation, the emphasis seems to be the glory of the ministry of the Spirit himself.  Now, if you'd like to read along with me, you can go to the website Bible Gateway, which has some great stuff on it, but for some odd reason, and sadly enough, they include the Passion translation with all the other translations that they offer.  Big mistake.  But we read, okay, 2 Corinthians 3, 8 through 11, once again, from the PT.  Even the ministry that was characterized by chiseled letters on stone tablets came with a dazzling measure of glory, though it produced death.  The Israelites couldn't bear to gaze on the glowing face of Moses because of the radiant splendor shining from his countenance, a glory destined to fade away.  Yet how much more radiant is the new and glorious ministry of the Spirit that shines from us?  For if the former ministry of condemnation was ushered in with a measure of glory, how much more does the ministry that imparts righteousness far excel in glory?  What was once glorious no longer holds any glory because of the increasingly greater glory that has replaced it.  The fading glory came with a portion of glory, but now we embrace the unfading ministry of a permanent impartation of  glory.\".  There is so much added to the text that is not there in the Greek that it's not even close to the original.  Now, here's one more example of Brian's NAR leanings as he concocted this mess.  Now, this time it's going to be from the New King James Version.  We're going to go to Philippians chapter 2, and we're going to start at verse 6. who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant and coming in the likeness of men.  And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.  Therefore God has highly exalted him and has given him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.  Okay, now this is that same passage from the Passion translation.  He existed in the form of God, yet he gave no thought of seizing equality with God as his supreme prize.  What?  There's no prize.  He is the second person of the Trinity who took on human flesh.  Instead, he emptied himself of his outward glory by reducing himself to the form of a lowly servant.  He became human.  He humbled himself and became vulnerable, choosing to be revealed as a man, while he was true man, and was obedient.  He was a perfect example.  Nowhere is that in the text.  Even in his death, a criminal's death by crucifixion.  Because of that obedience, God exalted him and multiplied his greatness as if Jesus could get more greatness as time goes on.  Again, he is fully God, fully man, truly God, truly man.  He has now been given the greatest of all names.  The authority of the name of Jesus causes every knee to bow in reverence.  Every thing and every one, it doesn't say every thing here, will one day submit to his name in the heavenly realm, that's another buzz phrase for the NAR, in the earthly realm and in the demonic realm.  Every tongue will proclaim in every language, Jesus Christ is Lord Yahweh, bringing glory and honor to God, his Father.  When it says every tongue, it means every single person.  This every tongue will proclaim in every language?  It's simply not there, folks.  You see, pseudo-Christian cults and non-Christian religions create their own versions of God's Word to fit their unbiblical views.  The Jehovah's Witnesses have the New World translation.  The Mormons have the Book of Mormon and the Joseph Smith translation of the Bible.  Christian science has science and health with key to the scriptures.  And, of course, the Muslims have the Koran.  and now the NAR folks have the Passion Translation.  Now, if you read any of these books that I just mentioned as a true Christian, do so only to sharpen your polemical skills in order to show how they depart from God's true word found only in Bibles that are faithfully translated from the Greek and Hebrew manuscripts and not from supposed encounters with angels or the fanciful minds of mere man.
