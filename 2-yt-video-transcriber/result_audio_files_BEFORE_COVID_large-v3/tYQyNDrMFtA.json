So, this video I want to explain more in detail about the commercials and transhumanism and the EMP and the other commercials.  I want to explain to you guys in more detail.  Starting with this first commercial, which I'm going to play right now.  I call him Robo-Child.  So, the first commercial I just showed, they're trying to teach robots how to develop emotions.  And now the second commercial, they're teaching robots how to command humans, okay?  So let me play it.  How do we tell people they get the best of both worlds with Sprint?  How about we get two sport legend BoJackson?  Holding a mermaid, playing a keytar, and a bird horse!  Woof!  Why don't you just tell people Sprint can save them more than a thousand dollars?  On an LTE advanced network that's now up to two times faster than before.  Alright, so this next commercial, they're trying to make us humans into like pets.  And it's going to show you, they're going to show you right here, which I'm going to play right now, what we are going to be turned into.  Basically like dogs. ",
