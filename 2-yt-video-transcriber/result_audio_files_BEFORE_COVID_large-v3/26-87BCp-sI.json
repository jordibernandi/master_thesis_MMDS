The silver spot price is rounding out the week just below $14.50 an ounce, while the gold spot price appears to be ending this week $1,280 USD per troy ounce.  The gold-silver ratio stands just over 88 ounces of silver for 1 ounce of gold, a more than 25-year high for this important valuation metric.  Given how low current silver valuations are at the moment, I believe this is a great week to take a look forward at potential valuation and crowd metrics.  which might help us in the future decide when and if ever to potentially sell some silver bullion that we have been acquiring up to today.

            "text": "Welcome to this week's Metals and Markets.  I'm your host, James Anderson of SD Bullion.  We have a few new guests lined up for coming shows in the weeks ahead, but for this week I want to take a forward look at some ideas and tools we can use to ponder when's a good time to sell silver, specifically.  Some of the tools we will cover can also be used in other broad-ranging asset classes, but for this week we'll focus on silver's future price potential.  I'll begin with a few caveats and assumptions.  selling any silver bullion, rather simply intend to give some of the silver to their heirs.  But the majority of listeners, I assume, are buying and saving silver bullion as a prudent percentage of their long-term savings.  As the future fiat currency prices for silver climbs, many may look to sell some silver bullion in order to use the proceeds to then buy other asset classes they deem worthwhile at the time.  For years now on this podcast, we've been operating on the presumption that we currently live under silver price discovery markets that for the most part by derivatives and futures contracts.  In a little bit, I will show when that was perhaps not totally so, but allow me to digress.  In artificially low-priced commodity markets, when the commodity's price gets too low, eventually real-world shortages will develop.  High demand with lacking supply use more of that commodity to come to market.  Here I'll be laying out a case for what potentially may happen to silver.  when this derivative-driven silver price depression phenomenon wears off and wanes away.  When new masses of marginal silver bullion buyers begin redeploying capital into this comparably small market cap versus other asset classes which dwarf the size of the silver market, it is very possible that silver's price could escalate very rapidly.  Being human, it's easy to look at the present situation and extrapolate it as if things will remain as they are now forever.  But less than one decade ago, silver price performance proved many doubters incorrect.  We will operate here presuming that silver will do this again, likely in the decade to come.  The difficult questions we'll tackle here is when to know silver valuation.  Here we'll cover some tools we can use to determine these questions ahead.  Not only silver, but virtually all commodities currently have been drudging along in some of their cheapest historic valuations versus stocks or equity valuations, bond prices, and fiat currency monetary supplies outstanding.  We'll operate under the assumption that this chart will not merely revert to its mean, but most likely overshoot to the upside in the years to come.  The chart we're looking at measures the value of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, the S&P 500 stock index, which only a pair of weeks ago again touched new record highs in nominal value.  The chart covers the full fiat currency era, going all the way back to 1970 until the end of 2017.  In this nearly half century, the ratio has gone from commodities being undervalued to overvalued versus S&P 500 stocks in six rather obvious swings, covering an average of eight years for each swing, peak to bottom.  The current bottoming swing we are in is about 11 years long, well overdue for a turnaround, historically speaking.  But again, we are operating under complex command and control financial markets, thus this current situation could persist longer than we may think is possible.  Here is this same chart valuation metric, updated to 2019.  As you can see, since the start of 2018, we have found a new low in the value of this Commodity Index versus S&P 500 Index.  With Federal Reserve spokesmen and women now clamoring for more inflation than their Ring 2% inflation target, I'll operate assuming one of the fastest ways to get price inflation or further fiat currency devaluations is through higher commodity prices in the decade to come.  My contention is this chart will flip and revert sharply as new monetary phenomenons like MMT allow for the powers to be to partially default on many trillions of promises made, which cannot be paid off currently at these fiat US dollar values.  In other words, the fastest and easiest way to exit the current situation we're in is further devaluing the currency.  The long-term US dollar devaluation trend we have been in since 1913 will not likely revert anytime soon.  Commodities like silver should have better days and years to come.  The next chart I'll show points to times and durations in which the comic silver futures markets fell under time spans in which the silver price was beginning to find price points which matched the eastern world's demand for the real thing.  Essentially, the black line reflects the overt influence of western silver derivative markets on silver's ongoing spot price, the red line on the chart.  The blue line on this chart shows the price of silver ongoing and compounding outside of New York trading hours.  If we operate under the assumption that Western financial authorities have been allowing large commercial banks to profit off of subjugating silver prices over the many decades, we can clearly see how silver's price has generally outperformed during Eastern hours of trading for silver and which such Western forces have been away from their silver trading desks.  Of course, no one can tell us the future, but looking back at this chart, there have been some somewhat recent few durations or points in time when diverting some silver bullion allocations into other asset classes made good sense.  Check out the three specific points in time where the red western driven spot price for silver hit the blue eastern measured silver price.  Early 2006, late 2007, early 2008, and then the spring of 2011 are all three points in time where the eastern-driven silver spot price and the world spot price in red converged.  The question to ponder now is at what fiat-US dollar price point might this convergence again reoccur?  Currently, the eastern-driven silver price is at $80.15 an ounce silver.  Hard to guess today at what price point it may be again when the red and blue lines converge.  My suggestion is looking back in time.  When they do, that is a solid time frame in which one should consider divesting some silver going capital into other, perhaps then undervalued asset classes.  Moving along, one of the easiest and free options to see how emotional an asset class and or financial market is becoming is simply using Google Trends.  The URL is www.google.com forward slash trends and it essentially measures human searches for any terms.  This chart I'm showing you now is for the highly searched term silver price.  Looking back we can see there were spikes coinciding with three 2006 to 2011 time frames in which the prior chart pointed out were good times to divest some silver bullion holdings elsewhere.  Most spikes in this key search in late 2008 to $50 an ounce in April 2011 were to see how low silver spot prices were falling.  But my expectation for if and when we pass silver's still all-time price high of $50 per ounce, the 2011 spike in silver price searches will be outdone by new or higher volumes of people looking to see where silver prices are headed.  Look for the spikes in both silver price action and silver price search volumes to perhaps deem when it is best to offload some silver bullion for other assets you may be keen to acquire.  This Google trend monitoring methodology works well with not only the silver price, it also performed remarkably well.  looking back at gold price searches.  Note the spike in August 2011 as gold eclipsed $1,900 per ounce.  Again, in the coming decade, as we perhaps near and past the $1,900 an ounce price level for gold, look for new search levels on Google Trends for gold price to spike higher than the 2011 all-time high and then likely find a newer, higher average search volume month by month.  Look for the spikes in both gold price action and gold price search volumes to perhaps deem when is best to offload some gold bullion for other asset classes you may be keen on acquiring.  Here's the Google trend monitoring methodology.  looking back at Bitcoin price searches.  The late 2017 high as Bitcoin topped out just below $20,000 is obvious.  looking backwards.  Now we overlay the same chart with simple lazy man school search for Dow.  That's the fastest way.  Here's the real-time example of a new all-time higher average level of searches with high spike and dive volatility since late 2017.  High motion and high volume search patterns are signs that an asset class is nearing a potential turning point.  The difficulty here is knowing what the financial system has become with interventions galore, where and how fast things could potentially roll over or even melt up further.  It's a guessing game I'm not taking part in.  I, like most of you listening, prefer to buy asset classes that are historically cheap, not fearing to miss out on buying things that may be hot or volatile or potentially overvalued.  The final and often cited metric we'll look at today to perhaps understand when silver is overvalued versus gold is the long-term gold-silver ratio.  Now some might argue that since silver occurs in the ground at 9 parts silver to 1 part gold, in a precious metal valuation peak timeframe we may again see the gold-silver ratio revert to below 20.  This ratio dipped to as low as 33 in 2011, and the trend line on this chart obviously suggests a reversion back toward 40 is coming again.  The question we all should ponder is how much it may potentially overshoot to the downside.  What's fair value for silver?  And what is the valuation for silver?  My hope is some of these charts and tools we've covered here today will help in my and perhaps your potential attempts at understanding and answering these questions of when to potentially sell silver in the years that unfold.
