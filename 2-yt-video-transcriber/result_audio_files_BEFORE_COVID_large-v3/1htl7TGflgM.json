            "text": "I've said before that I think that most women are not empathetic like they claim to be, especially towards men.  I say this because women are very often inaccurate at predicting people's behavior or their wants or needs.  Also, if most women had any empathy towards men, then they would not be able to so brutally steal a man's wealth at every corner, even when they do the smaller things like pretend to like a guy so he will give them free stuff.  That's theft, and you can only steal from somebody you don't empathize with.  However, that does not stop them from labeling anybody who disagrees with them as lacking empathy or having a low EQ or emotional intelligence, which, by the way, is not a measure of intelligence.  It's just a measure of agreeableness.  Now, I have looked everywhere for the Jordan Peterson video where he talks about this, and I can't find it.  But basically, when you test the questionnaire for EQ against the questionnaire for agreeableness, EQ becomes a very accurate predictor of agreeableness.  High EQ means agreeable, low EQ means disagreeable.  Being agreeable or disagreeable does not make you smarter.  But anyway, this is all just a projection on their lack of empathy, because if they could empathize with the men they are calling deadbeats, then they might be able to see why men act like that in the first place.  Those of you listening, if you got a woman pregnant and she told you that she was going to give the kid up for adoption but then decided to keep the baby, would you be mad and resentful because she lied to you?  Or would you be overjoyed and ready to take the responsibility for the decision that wasn't yours?  Remember, it's her decision to keep the baby.  You as a male have no choice, yet you bear the responsibility for her choice and are publicly shamed for refusing to pay for her decision.  on top of that all of the most effective birth control measures are exclusive to women.  what if she lied to you about being on the pill and got pregnant?  is it now your responsibility to take care of a child that you had no choice over the conception of?  Tell me, Tamara, could that be why men are reluctant to pay?  And we haven't even gotten to the double standard yet.  Well, maybe I did a little, because Tamara says she hates it when men play the blame game, but then blames men as being unilaterally responsible for the problems in single-parent homes.  However... I am sure you guys noticed that Miss Sister Sister, Tamara Mowry, hates it when men play the victim card.  She must be joking.  I mean, come on, it wasn't even that hard during the research for me to find an example of Tamara flashing the victim card.  I literally found her doing it in the very first video I found, ironically called The Double Standard. ",

But you want to say that men can fail their way to the top, and that's unfair.  What about the women who fucked their way to the top?  I'm sure that the likes of Michelle Obama would just say the poor, helpless women were manipulated by their male boss when she had sex with him to get a promotion, and she had to do it or else he thought she might get fired or he might destroy her career.

            "text": "Tell me.  Was it cowardly when you recorded your friends without their knowledge so that you could eavesdrop on them and pretend that nothing happened?  Was it cowardly when you secretly recorded your husband because you thought he cheated, or would it have been better and braver just to talk to him about it?  I think it's obvious at this point that this entire video from the reel is just a projection of female nature onto men.  You hate liars?  Well, women lie all the time.  How about that makeup that all of you are wearing?  Women use things like makeup, high heels, and push-up bras to lie about the attractiveness that they have, and they don't see a problem with that at all.  In fact, it's just normal behavior.  It's normal for women to lie about how attractive they are, but it's not the same story with guys.  If you were a guy, and you lie about being a doctor to be more attractive to women than you are a lying sack of shit but no one says shit when women wear make-up.  all of this just shows you how little these women have looked at their own faults and instead spent that time flinging mud at others.  He who is without sin should cast the first stone.  If you are going to accuse somebody, then you should point that accusation at yourself first to make sure that you actually uphold the standard that you are putting on the other person.  Pointing accusations at yourself is how you become stronger.  Constantly pointing the accusations at others will make you weak.  This reminds me of a small acting class I took with a few other people, taught by a moderately famous actor.  During the class, one or two people would act, and the rest of us would watch.  While we were watching, we would notice that maybe a person wasn't speaking loud enough, or they would mispronounce words, or maybe they wouldn't put enough emotion into the character.  So after about five hours, roughly in the middle of the class, the teacher spoke to us and said, During the class, you have been watching your peers, and you have probably noticed that they have done a few things wrong.  Now, in reality, they are doing like a hundred things wrong, but you honed in on maybe two or three.  Why out of all the things they are doing wrong, did you only pick two or three of those things?  Most likely, you picked them because they are true about you.  If you notice that every person who goes up to act in front of the class is not speaking loud enough, and you haven't investigated that in yourself first, then it's true about you.  You can cry and get all offended by that, or you can see it as a way of identifying all the things that are wrong with you.  that could be made better.  At the very least, if you were saying, I hate it when a person does this, then you should be making sure that you aren't doing the undesirable behavior yourself.  Getting back to the real though, let's follow the timeline.  The eavesdropping video where Adrienne Byline says she records her friends without their knowledge and then lies about it came out this year, in 2019.  The video where she calls liars cowards is from 2016.  Now, she mentioned in the 2019 video that she had been recording her friends for years.  So, she makes the bold statement about liars in 2016 that all of them are cowards on TV, and then goes and commits quite a big violation of her friends' privacy when she's at home.  Failing to notice things like this will make you weak.  Failing to notice these things will make you undesirable to good people because what quality person wants to be around those who lie all the time?  What quality person is going to want to be around people who just fling their dirty laundry at others, including their friends, including you?  If you happen to notice that everyone in your life is a liar, or at the very least a lot of people in your life are liars, maybe the only reason for that is because you are a liar and they are the only ones who will put up with you.  If your ex-husband slash baby's daddy is a deadbeat, then maybe the only reason he dated you was because you are a deadbeat too.  If you notice that everyone around you blames all their problems on other people, That is true about you.  If it wasn't true, then why would you put up with that?
