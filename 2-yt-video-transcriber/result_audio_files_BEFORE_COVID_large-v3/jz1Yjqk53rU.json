            "text": "what's going on America?  this is Kevin from Kevin's corner about to go salsa dancing.  that's right doesn't matter whether it's the weekend weekday.  I got to make it happen all the time.  little small resource of cardio.  I'm not that guy that's gonna get on the the treadmill and be running and not going anywhere.  I feel like a hamster.  so I choose to salsa dance.  but on my way I was reading an article that somebody posted on my timeline.  now This is how Donald Trump shows all of his racism, his sexism, his misogyny, all of that stuff.  Discrimination against black people, women and women of color, all of that stuff that they say he does.  He shows that by nominating the first black female general to, I guess, the Marines.  Yep, that's pretty misogynistic, pretty sexist, pretty racist.  And look, she covers a whole bunch of the little checkboxes on the left.  I mean, she's black.  She's a woman.  I mean, heck, I bet you they think Donald Trump says she shouldn't even be in the military.  They let women in now?  When did this happen?  yeah and so he nominated her.  but i wonder if cnn is going to cover that.  wonder if msnbc is going to drop that little nugget out that you know what.  no because they're too busy focused on donald trump and ilhan omar and the fact that obviously just because she's black and just because she's a woman and a muslim donald trump wants her out.  hey a space opened up.  i'm pulling up.  i'm sorry y'all Y'all just gonna have to roll with me for a minute.  Can you roll with me up there?  Because I gotta move up a little bit.  They got me almost my butt sticking out.  I don't want my butt sticking out.  So let me go ahead and move up here.  That's right.  Move.  Keep it.  Get out of the way.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Superstar parking.  Superstar.  Anyway, so that's the deal.  I hope this lady gets it.  She looked like she's a stand up woman and looks tough.  Look like she's like, yeah, that's the reason why he nominated me.  So I'm going to be waiting for CNN and MSNBC to talk about this.  I'm sure I'll be waiting a long time.  Anyway, I just want to inform you all because the other alternative.  Fake news won't tell you that.  Anyway, God bless you.  Check me out.
