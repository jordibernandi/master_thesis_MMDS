            "text": "Another day, another mini stock market crash.  Got the Dow Jones here in the middle of the day down already 750 points.  Here we have an article out of NBCNews.com.  Dow falls 750 points as key recession indicator rings loud alarm bells.  So it goes on to talk about how the stock market is going down because of the yield curve inversion.  They're acting like this is news, whereas the yield curve has actually been inverted for the last three months.  Only today, it hit like the most serious of all yield curve inversion indicators.  And that is because the 10-year treasury yield has now dropped below the two-year.  So it's right there in plain sight for everybody to see.  And the proof really is in the pudding because, I mean, look at all that red there.  And yesterday, the market shot up 400 points in about 30 minutes, and then it just stayed there.  The day before that, it dropped 400 points.  Today, it's down 750 points.  Last week, it was down 750 points.  so as you can see the stock market the entire economy is anything but stable and we are definitely due officially for a recession if we're not already in one right now at this moment.  but you know it's going to take probably a lot more serious things to occur for the average person to wake up out there and to actually do something about it to protect themselves.  but In the meantime, we'll keep researching here and putting out articles and news reports on my channel and just keeping people aware as much as possible, as much as people want to listen.  Because, you know, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.  So here we have more articles, headlines, stock losses deepen as key recession warning surfaces, recession indicator, what it means when yield curve inverts.  So what it means is that you get paid less money for buying a 10-year bond than you would for buying a two-year bond.  so why would you buy a 10-year bond if you know you're going to lose money?  why wouldn't you buy the two-year bond?  but even the two-year bond is so low you're still going to lose money.  so um you know people are acting like this is news.  it's not news it's.  um it's very old news.  and i remember for the last couple of months The mainstream media put out all kinds of articles talking about, oh, we don't really need to pay attention to these old-timey traditional indicators.  You know, they've only been right 10 out of the last 13 times.  So, I mean, who wants to take a bet on something that's right 10 out of 13 times?  Some more economic news that I learned just the other day and I found really, really strange but suspect.  And check out this headline.  Foreign automakers increase sales by such and such, but... Okay, U.S.  automakers don't report sales on a monthly basis anymore.  Did you know that?  Did you know that just in this past year, U.S.  automakers have all decided to just stop publishing monthly sales data?  I mean, they must be doing so good that they don't want to brag, right?  They don't want to boast and make anybody else feel bad.  They're just that humble.  And so they decided, eh, you know, we'll just quietly release data on a quarterly basis.  So here you have a chart with all of these, you know, you have Audi, BMW, Acura.  Oh, and then you have all the American ones, completely blank.  Then you have Honda, Infiniti, Jeep.  Oh, nothing to be found.  Lincoln, no.  Ram?  Not even Tesla.  Even Elon Musk is hiding his numbers from us.  Elon Musk.  Not Elon Musk.  The one man in the world I trusted.  Of course, I'm kidding.  But yeah, so this is not a good sign when companies and corporations are like going out of their way to hide their numbers from the public, okay?  And At a time of record stock share buybacks when companies have been borrowing money just to buy their own stock to keep their prices inflated and then hiding the real economic indicators like sales, profits, you know there's a problem.  Here we have another canary in the coal mine.  Jaguar I-Pace sales have crashed.  Dealer inventory exceeds six months supply.  And this just came out yesterday.  So it says the Jaguar I-Pace is one hell of a car.  But anyways, so it's, you know... a high-priced car, Jaguar.  They make luxury vehicles.  It's not the kind of car an average person buys.  It's like upper-middle-class kind of car and a high-class kind of car.  And so when upper-middle-class people are not buying their luxury automobiles and high-class people are not buying luxury automobiles, Again, that's a big problem.  It's like when people stop buying RVs, which they have, essentially.  I covered that in my last video.  And finally, this article's interesting.  Banks are paying people to borrow money now.  All right, so, you know, central banks around the world are dropping interest rates, going into the negative territory.  Germany's in negative interest rate territory.  Japan is in negative interest rate territory.  And so now... Banks are stealing savings out of the middle class to keep the Ponzi scheme going.  And so now banks have decided, well, they're going to continue to up the ante on the fraud.  And now, in a time of an economic slump, they're going to pay you to take the risk of a new mortgage on.  And again, see, because everything is so artificial, and because the banks pretty much rule over us as peasants on the New World plantation, as long as they can keep printing money and devaluing currency, You know, they can keep the prices high of houses, of cars, of everything.  Because without any type of correcting mechanism in markets, because we don't have a free market, they'll just print money and then, you know, they'll dump a wheelbarrow full of worthless cash at your feet that you were obligated for.  that you can exchange for a house, which they own.  And of course the economy gets worse.  People lose their jobs, their meager incomes, and then they can't even pay back that loan, which was taken out at a negative interest rate.  And guess what?  Bank comes back, scoops up the house.  They made a little profit off of that short-term loan.  And that middle-class homeowner now gets to look forward to being a renter for the rest of their lives.  So This is another reason why baby boomers are also increasingly becoming renters.  Because, you know, 10 years ago when the Great Recession and the housing market crisis hit, really, if you look at it a different way, all that was was an exchange, a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the elites, to the top 10, to the top 5, and the top 1%.  And the big banks, you know, it's just people getting their property confiscated due to all of this reckless monetary policy, all of these shady accounting techniques.  You know, basically what we have is Enron on a global level now throughout the economy.  You know, it's just.  it's one giant fraud.  And, you know.  they're just a bunch of predators.  so this is just stuff to think about moving forward and this explains why the stock market is so high but also why it's so volatile and there is absolutely nothing fundamentally supporting prices at this point.  it's just tweets and whims.  and then you know algorithms And people speculating, that's all it is.  And you have the smart money, the big institutions already pulling out their money from the stock market.  And then you have the average Joe who sees he's losing money if he tries to save it in a bank account.  He's going to lose money if he buys treasuries.  Well, where else could he go?  The stock market?  Well, that's what a lot of people do.  Most people don't think, you know, maybe I'll buy gold and silver because it's just not exciting.  It's not sexy.  And there's not that, you know, allure of an immediate return to speculate and make some easy bucks.  But I'm gonna put a link below to my website, thebestgoldirarolloverguide.net.  I've got news and articles on here.  as well as a way for you to sign up and receive a free gold IRA rollover kit investment kit here and could help you out if you have a 401k or an IRA and you don't want to lose everything the next time the market crashes.  and the way the market is looking these days the way the economy is looking I don't know.  All I can say is that there's too many cracks in the dam and eventually the dam will fall and the village will be flooded.  So I just want to say good luck to everybody out there.  Do your research and stay vigilant, stay aware.  And don't believe all of the hype and the nonsense because the news articles change on a daily basis.  If the stock market goes up, the headlines are, oh, Dow has a great day due to, you know, success being made in the trade talks with China.  And then, you know, if the market has a bad day, then they go, oh, the yield inversion is causing the market to slump.  Whereas, you know, really the yield curve inversion is more of a, it's sort of an it.  It's an indicator.  It's not a cause.  And the indicator has been here for the last three months, which is serious.  But most people can't wrap their heads around that.  And most of the mainstream media will not harp too much on it because, again, they start to come dangerously close to actually educating the public.  And the last thing they want is an educated public.  So thanks for watching this video.  I will catch you on the next one.  Take care. ",
