But to convince people that they have access to special information, they rely on one of two methods.  Cold reading, which is where you read the sitter cold, relying on verbal and nonverbal clues to glean information from them.  Sort of like Sherlock Holmes.  And hot reading, which is where the psychics research the sitter ahead of time using tools like social media and either memorizes the details or has someone communicate it via an earpiece.  I've done entire videos on the methods of both tactics and will put links to them below. ",

That became what would later be called Operation Peach Pit, and they were joined by the paranormal investigator and skeptic, Kenny Biddle.  Between the two operations, Thomas John was given his own TV show on Lifetime called The Seatbelt Psychic, where he would pick up alleged strangers in a rideshare and give them both a lift and a reading.  And his accuracy seems pretty impressive at first.  But after a bit of investigation, Susan discovered that the sitters being read were actually paid actors for the company that produced the show.  She has an entire article about her findings, and I'll link to it in the description below.  To anyone thinking that psychics are all just fun and games, they most certainly are not, and have conned people out of their life savings, wasted police resources, and cost others their mental health and sometimes even their lives.  I have a whole video on what the harm is and I'll link to it below.  If you have a friend or family member who's fallen prey to one of these grief vampires, I have an entire series on my channel exposing psychics and the tricks that they use.  Feel free to share it with people and call out these psychic vultures wherever you see them.  Don't let them get away with this.  I'm also going to put links below to Susan's articles, the New York Times story, and the full audio recordings for Operation Pizza Roll.  And if you appreciate this video and the work that I do promoting skepticism and critical thinking, you can support my work on a per-episode basis at patreon.com.  slash holykoolaid.  Lastly, after the Times article, Thomas John responded to the allegations in a live Facebook stream.  So it's only fair that I give him the final word.
