This is like when a hardcore libertarian is like, I don't think the Civil Rights Act should have been passed as a national constitutional amendment.  I think the states should decide.  Now, in a vacuum, this person is saying they share a goal with you.  Both of you want to reduce racial prejudice in society.  You just want to do it through a constitutional amendment, and the libertarian wants to do it by letting the states decide.  However, in practice... what this means is that many states will not choose to legislate equality to the same degree that the constitutional amendment would have.  so while both of these people pursue the same goal in a context-devoid superfluous nonsense sort of way in reality One of them, the one who supports the constitutional amendment, actually supports the reduction of racism in society.  And the one who supports the states' rights approach is instead forestalling the end of racism by ensuring it is dealt with and capitulated to in the weakest possible terms.  That's what's happening here.  Oh, yeah, we both want to deal with global warming.  You just support policies which have been proven to be efficacious and are the only chance humanity will have of making it to the 22nd century.  And I want to let the free market solve the problem.

It was only past the age of five or six or so that they, when their gendered characteristics became a little bit more visibly evident, that they started to be referred to as young lady or boy.  But girl was the gender-neutral pronoun used used to refer to young children.  This is historical fact, by the way.  This is true.  This happened.  It's out there.  Go look it up.  So what this person is calling child abuse was actually.  not only does this idea of a gender neutral way of referring to young children exist outside American society and predate modern society.

You know where else there are open borders?  In the EU.  See?  The EU has made an agreement amidst all of its constituent countries that people can freely travel between EU countries as long as they have a broader EU license or passport or something, right?  I don't know.  I'm not a fucking Brit bonger.  Not that they're part of the EU anymore, am I right?  But guess what?  In spite of this open borders cultural imposition of others... Germany yet remains Germany.  Spain yet remains Spain.  France yet remains France.  Poland yet remains Poland.  Norway, Sweden, Switzerland.  All of these countries still have a distinct national identity after decades of open borders.  With their neighbors.  Yeah, EU.  white though.  Exactly.  It's a racial argument.  The idea that immigrants in and of themselves will destroy a country's hegemony and culture is invoked only when those people are of a different skin color, which harkens back to my earlier statement on whiteness being used exclusively as an exclusionary tool.
