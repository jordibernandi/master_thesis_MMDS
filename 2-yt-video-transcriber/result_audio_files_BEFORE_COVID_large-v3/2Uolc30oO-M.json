            "text": "Exposing CNN's bias was important to me because I believe everyone should know where their news is coming from, left, right, or center.  Of course I was afraid to expose CNN.  It's the biggest media conglomerate in the world.  If you come forward, Veritas will have your back.  I want to inspire others the way that I was inspired by the previous whistleblowers, you know, your Facebook insiders, Zach, Eric, all those men and women, patriots that came before me.  My only goal here is to inspire others to come out, get in the sunlight, and I promise you it'll feel so much better on this side. ",
