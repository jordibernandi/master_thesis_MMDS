            "text": "Hello everybody, Peter of England here, bringing you an update concerning the Facebook class action lawsuit that was initiated around about three weeks ago now.  For all those people who have subscribed to the class action, thank you very much.  As you can see by the views on the call to arms, that was obviously the previous video, We've had around about 63,000 views on that in a relatively short period of time, and a good percentage of people who have watched have obviously said that they are in, because this is the no-brainer class action lawsuit of all time.  However, to all those people that have joined, all those people that have said that they want to participate in this largest class action lawsuit ever initiated, Thank you very much, but please, please, we still need you to go out there and inform your friends, inform your colleagues at work, inform anyone and everyone you can to simply come along, look at this, the video link below, and subscribe by, one, subscribing to the video channel, but equally putting in a little email to us at the address that we gave to you before.  That's admin1 at freemanlegalservices.com or peter at weirbank.co.uk.  Please just have a look at the email address links that are posted below.  So, what I'm trying to do now is give you some update and indication of where we're going and what timeline you could expect for a commencement of this.  Now, first of all, as everyone who's possibly been ever involved in any type of class action lawsuit, or for all those people who have a background in law, what you will realize is that usually it is always best if a criminal case, a criminal action, has been successful before an action for damages takes place.  This is for the obvious reasons that once a criminal action has been successful in the courts, it's almost then an open and shut case for a procedure to easily prove on the back of that criminal case that the plaintiffs are accessible or have access or should have access to a payment for damages for the wrong or the harms that have been done.  Now, many of you have also asked the question, why is it that we're supposedly going after Zuckerberg?  Why are we just going after Facebook?  Why aren't we going after the echelon of greed and manipulation?  that's behind the whole issue here?  And in fact, the answer to that question is, we are.  We are going after those people.  We are going after the old NSA.  We are going after the old clowns in America, the CIA.  We are going after those involved in the Obama administration who were tacit in supporting these organizations.  We're going after the employees of DARPA, the employees that set up LifeLog.  We will go after all these individuals, not one at a time, but in groups at a time, but we have to start somewhere.  So that's really what I'm referring you to when I say that we have to start somewhere and we will begin with Facebook.  Don't forget, we've got Alphabet Inc.  to look at next, we've got Amazon to look at, we've got a whole range of potential lawsuits out there.  So, just to recap for everyone that's been involved so far, the situation is we've had around 63,000 views, those views are going up all the time, and the vast majority are subscribing and also saying that they want to participate in the class action lawsuit.  For anyone new on this video, please just make sure that you send the email to us saying that you want to be in, or I'm in, or FB.  I'm in, however you want to express it, short and sharp.  We've responded to most of the people that have actually declared that they want to join.  We will get to you all eventually, but as you can imagine, our email lists now are growing faster than we can almost keep up with.  But everyone will receive a reply, everyone will receive an acknowledgement, and in due course, what we will do then is we will section various groups into parts of the 100 or 120, 117,000 people that we require, and as these smaller subunits close, We will then notify you of what's to happen next.  We will then be sending you a document within the email which asks you to fill in a few details.  One of the main things that you can start to prepare now is simply to be able to show that you had a Facebook account between particular dates.  That's all we are asking you to do.  the lists will be closed with around about 10,000 in each list and that means 10 lists of 10,000 in each brings us up to around about 100,000. and then as these lists close what I'm going to do is I'm going to announce webinar dates.  so we will then offer a webinar and and everything will be discussed or explained to you in the webinar and that will obviously incur a question and answer session but obviously the limits to what can be asked and what can't be asked will be quite short because sheer numbers of people that will be requiring your questions answered.  Criminal charges are to proceed.  As the criminal charges proceed and are confirmed, the class action will start to roll out.  So, that's really where I am so far.  Please be aware that most of these charges that are going to possibly be alleged in the criminal cases come out of United States Code.  That's Chapter 115, Paragraph 2381, I believe.  for all those legal hound dogs out there who are interested, and that is the law relating to treason and sedition.  So, the penalty for treason and sedition and subversion, according to the United States Code and the criminal code of war, is death.  So, for all these individuals that try to bring down the American way of life, the American government, the administration in the White House at the moment, and were traitors to you, are awaiting traitor's justice.  As they wanted to give, so shall they receive.  So, this is Peter of England saying thank you very much for listening.  Thank you for supporting this cause.  Please subscribe and hit the little bell for notifications.
