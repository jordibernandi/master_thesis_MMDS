            "text": "The Antichrist.  It's been up for debate for many, many years who the Antichrist is.  And why is it important to know the identity of the Antichrist if we can?  The Bible says that in Revelation, many believe you won't know who he is until after the rapture, but that's not true.  The Bible also says in Revelation, those of us who have discernment and wisdom and knowledge will know who he is right now.  He's a man whose name is a number, and that number is 666.  First of all, I'm convinced there has always been an Antichrist at the ready.  throughout history because the devil does not know when Christ is going to return.  No one knows but God.  But the devil's always had someone ready.  Look at this picture up here.  All these guys from the past.  Any one of these guys could have been the Antichrist.  I mean, easily.  devil has always had a man at the ready at all times throughout history.  but now the world is looking at a group of people.  the Antichrist is actually here.  he actually just spoke at the EU and I'm going to go over that in a minute.  but first I'm going to go through the back story and go through some names.  people believe that Macron the head of France will be the Antichrist.  first of all he can even control his own country let alone the world and he does.  he is from the EU which is which is correct but he does not match the 20 scripture in the Bible for the Antichrist.  People think that Erdogan, the head of Turkey, is the Antichrist.  Again, he matches being from the EU.  He can't even control his own people.  He just lost his capital of Ankara and also Istanbul, biggest cities in Turkey, lost them in the election.  He can't even control Turkey.  He does not match the 20 scripture.  And people think that the guy Cyprus from Greece is the Antichrist.  And again, he can't even control his own country.  He is from the EU, but does not match the scripture.  You have the two princes in England.  And actually, Charles and then Harry and his brother.  They're all from the EU, correct.  But they don't match the 20 scripture of who the Antichrist is.  Again, we have to go by the Bible to match scripture.  And the list goes on and on.  But those are our five main headliners of today.  who people believe are the Antichrist, but by default they are not because they do not match Scripture.  Now, this man just came to the EU.  He showed up at the EU in April 2019, this month, a couple days ago, and met with the EU, met with a large crowd, and told them that from this day forward, he wants to be involved with every aspect of their entire life in the EU.  He wants to be there to actually show them a way show them what they should do, lead them and guide them in what they need to do, and basically be their head and their leader.  And that's what the Antichrist will do.  The EU will be his stomping grounds to begin with.  That's where he's from.  And I also believe the Antichrist will rule from the UN because the UN is the great whore that sits upon many waters because the many waters are the people of the earth.  And the UN controls all the people of the earth.  And I believe the Antichrist will rule from the UN until he defiles the third temple in Jerusalem, and then he'll rule from there for the second half of the tribulation.  But he will come from the EU.  It makes sense.  he's starting off with his people, his own people in the EU, getting it together.  Now, who is this man?  Who is this man?  who is the Antichrist?  First of all, he is, indeed, from the EU.  When your father or your mother are born in a certain country, By birth, you are also, by default, born from that country.  This man's dad was born in the EU.  His mom was born in the EU.  His family was born in the EU.  And on top of that, He is also directly related to the original emperor of Rome, the original head of the Roman Empire, which is the center, the heart of the EU.  Doesn't get any more EU than that.  This man matches every single scripture in the Bible, all 20 scriptures.  His name is a number.  His number is 666.  None of the other so-called antichrists can match that.  This man has everything covered in stone.  He has everything covered in spades.  It's all there for the whole world to see.  And this man's name is Barack Hussein Obama.  I know I've told you so many times in the past.  I've showed you how he will not go away.  Most presidents, when they get out of office, they lay low and hide.  This guy's been in the news more now than even when he was in the office.  This guy is everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, constantly.  He's not going away.  His RFID chip in Obamacare, I'm convinced, is the mark of the beast.  He is the man, my friends.  And unless someone else comes along... and replaces him.  he is the man he matches every single thing that the antichrist is about 700 other sidebar items that are approved.  i don't think we have enough time in the earth right now to have a new antichrist appear the false prophets.  pope francis he's here.  all the signs in matthew 24 and all the signs in the bible are here right now.  they're all here.  Everything's ready to go.  I believe the man of sin, the man of perdition, the Antichrist is here right now.  He just went to his people in the European Union and spoke to them and talked to them.  Remember, they wanted him to run for president of France just a couple of years ago.  They love him over there in a big, big way.  They love him around the entire world.  He's the most beloved man, the most trusted man on earth, including America, for like the last 10 years running.  Here's the bottom line.  Jesus Christ is our only hope.  He's soon going to take his bride out of here.  And those who are left behind, which includes all the unsaved and all the backslidden Christians, are going to be here for seven pure years of hell where if God didn't intervene, everybody would die.  It's going to be horrific as billions and billions and billions and billions will die the most grotesque, awful, terrible, horrific deaths imaginable man.  It's going to be nightmarish, a hellish, nightmarish scenario.  beyond your wildest dreams, my friends.  It's going to be horrendous, horrendous, horrendous.  I mean, I can't even tell you how bad it's going to be.  Just pure hell, pure pain, pure suffering, righteous judgment from God of just misery, suffering, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, homelessness, joblessness.  If you refuse the mark of the beast, you'll be hunted down like a wild animal, tortured, beheaded.  For your faith.  If you take the mark of the beast.  You will die a horrendous death.  It's been forever in hell.  And the lake of fire for eternity.  It will be a spiritual death.  Not a physical one.  It's going to be awful my friends.  And there's no reason for anyone to go through that.  And I know that a lot of Christians don't believe that you have to repent.  But the Bible says in hundreds of scriptures that you have to.  Believe what you want to believe.  I believe the Bible.  Believe what you want to believe.  I believe the Bible 100% totally all the time.  It's going to be terrible.  Don't be among the billions that die grotesque deaths.  If you'd like prayer for anything, contact me.  I pray for you every day without fail.  Pray that prayer.
