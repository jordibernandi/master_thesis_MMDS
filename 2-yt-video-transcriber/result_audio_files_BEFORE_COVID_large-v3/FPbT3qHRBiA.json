Before we do operations, we try to find established aftercare homes that we are able to work with.  And so we've met with several different NGOs that have safe homes, education, mental health therapy, and vocational training, and job placement.  So those are some of the things that we do before any operations happen so that the children have somewhere to go when they're rescued.  We're so grateful for the support that you have given and for everything that you continue to do.  But most of all, I'm so grateful for your heart.  You guys love these children.  You love these girls and boys that are being rescued and freed from human trafficking.  Without you, we really wouldn't be able to do it.  Thank you so much. ",
