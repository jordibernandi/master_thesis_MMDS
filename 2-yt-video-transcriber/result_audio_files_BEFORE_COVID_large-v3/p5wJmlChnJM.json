While you might think this happened at some underground animal fighting ring, in fact, this criminal behavior occurred in the open in July 2019 at the California Rodeo at Salinas in Monterey County, California.  It is the largest rodeo in the state.  Renowned veterinarian Peggy Larson watched our video and said the following. ",

I stopped the video several times to look at the bull with the bleeding tongue.  He does not retract his tongue.  It appears that the tongue was bitten by one of the dogs.  I have to wonder if the damage was severe enough so that the bull could not retract his tongue.  This is animal abuse. ",

            "text": "This type of animal versus animal fight violates California state law.  Yet it was allowed to go on without consequence by the Rodeo Committee, the sponsors, local and state law enforcement, and most incredibly, the SPCA for Monterey County, which claims it has investigators at the rodeo every day.  Shark has documented previous acts of animal cruelty at Salinas, yet this same cabal of corruption, the rodeo, the sponsors, the police, and the SPCA have always protected the abusers.  Brent Eastman is an insurance agent and the president of the Salinas Rodeo.  His brother Tim Eastman is not only on the board of directors, but is also the head veterinarian for the rodeo.  This incestuous conflict of interest is one of the many reasons why such brutality exists at Salinas.  Even though Shark knows how protective the Monterey County SPCA has been of the rodeo, we physically went to their office with the information of this illegal fighting.  They said they'd get back to us, but never did.  This violence simply doesn't matter to this worthless, corrupt SPCA, which takes in $7 million a year under the guise of protecting animals.  Shark has repeatedly reported the Salinas Rodeo to the California Veterinary Medical Board, which oversees rodeo operations.  But each and every time, the vet board has given the rodeo a pass.  Besides clearly violating state law, animal fighting violates Salinas' own self-serving but ultimately worthless livestock welfare policy.  And if you think that the police at the state level would do something if they were present, ",
