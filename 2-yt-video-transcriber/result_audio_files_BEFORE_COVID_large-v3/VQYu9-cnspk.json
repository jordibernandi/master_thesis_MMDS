            "text": "Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthfication Chronicles and this is a tweet from Representative Doug Collins from May 30th.  Leaking classified and sealed material is a dangerous illegal action.  The DOJ's declination to prosecute leaks is concerning and only emboldens leakers to continue their reckless actions.  Read more of my letter to AG Barr here.  And when you click on this, it'll take you to the House Judiciary or the Republicans Judiciary page.  And that's the link right there, and it talks about it down here.  Here's the actual letter itself, and so we'll just go with the actual letters.  That's what I'll put down below for you.  Anyway, he starts out and he says, Dear Attorney General Barr, I write regarding yesterday's investigative summary issued by the Department's Office of the Inspector General.  Titled, Findings of Misconduct by an FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Unauthorized Conducts with the Media, Disclosing Law Enforcement and Other Sensitive Information to the Media, and Accepting a Gift from the Media Summary.  Okay, that's this document right here, which I made a video of a couple days ago.  And that's this one right here, Mystery FBI Man and Woman.  and so we didn't know it didn't state whether it was a man or a woman.  we kind of figured it was a man and i figured that it probably was peter struck but anyway we'll deal with that in just a minute.  and so that's what it was.  and the summary notes an fbi deputy assistant director and that's dad disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court in violation of 18 usc section 401 contempt of court.  the summary noted however prosecution of the dad was declined.  now i told you about that and you know we were all kind of disappointed that it said that.  well we weren't the only ones disappointed.  doug collins was disappointed as well.  as you are aware the dissemination of material filed under seal with the federal court is a serious offense especially when the person engaging in the unauthorized dissemination is a law enforcement official who should know better.  okay it undermines a fundamental underpinning of our justice system and can put lives in jeopardy.  leaking classified material is also a dangerous illegal action.  the department's declination to prosecute leaks only serves to embolden leakers to continue their reckless actions over time.  There are at least three potential investigations of former senior FBI officials regarding unauthorized leaks.  Your predecessor, Jeff Sessions, recognized the damage such leaks could do and vowed to combat them.  On November 14, 2017, he testified to Congress, quote, Members of the committee, we had about nine open investigations of classified leaks in the last three years.  We have 27 investigations open today.  We intend to get to the bottom of these leaks.  Under Sessions' tenure, the department took aggressive action towards investigating leakers.  In addition to the disclosures noted in the summary, the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut began conducting a criminal investigation into former FBI General Counsel James Baker, for leaking information to reporters.  Notably, a grand jury returned a three-count indictment against a former staffer for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding his role in an investigation into the leaking of classified information.  That was James Wolfe, I do believe.  Wolfe with an E at the end.  Last April, it was reported the Inspector General referred former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to the U.S.  Attorney for the District of Columbia due to McCabe's lack of candor.  As the OIG reported, McCabe disclosed confidential investigative details to a media outlet to advance his personal interests at the expense of department leadership.  McCabe subsequently lied under oath to the FBI's Inspections Division and the DOJ OIG.  Separately, last June, the Inspector General testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  his office was investigating former FBI Director James Comey's leaking of memos.  he wrote regarding his conversations with the president.  Over the past year, however, little information has been shared publicly or with Congress regarding the status of these leak investigations.  My question too, Doug.  Yep, I'm with you on this.  Therefore, please provide answers to the following questions on or before June 7, 2019.  1.  Did the OIG refer the DAD discussed in yesterday's summary to the Department for Prosecution?  did the department decline prosecution?  why?  number two is the investigation into james baker still ongoing?  number three did the oig criminal referral regarding andrew mccabe develop into an investigation?  if yes is it ongoing and what is the status?  how many active cases does the department have regarding classified leaks?  bingo i'd love to know that answer.  number five has the department recently conducted a criminal investigation into james comey regarding possible leaking of classified information?  if so how did that investigation originate and what is the status of that investigation?  and here are the links to the things that he's been talking about.  so right there.  Okay, and thank you in advance for your answers to these questions.  And so, yeah, and of course, he also gives a copy to Jerry Nadler, who I'm sure hates that he's doing this.  Anyway, so let's go on.  Then he wrote one also to Michael Horowitz, and it's not exactly the same letter.  Okay, so stick with me on this.  Dear Inspector General Horowitz, I write regarding the investigative summary released by your office yesterday entitled All That Big Long Thing Again.  The investigation leading to the summary originally stemmed from your offices, and that's the big title of the OIG report that we got in June of 2018.  So, yeah, they give these titles.  You know, they're huge, long titles.  The summary states, in pertinent part, the OIG investigation concluded that the DAD, Deputy Assistant Director, engaged in conduct when the DAD, one, disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, and two, in violation of 18 USC section 401 contempt of court.  and again he's taking this directly from this document right here.  okay this is where he got it that you know right.  there is the paragraph that he's talking about and then he goes on and he says Number two, provided without authorization, FBI law enforcement sensitive information, two reporters on multiple occasions, and three had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization in violation of FBI policy.  Okay, in summary, letter states prosecution of the D.A.D.  was declined.  That was the part that we were all getting all hyper about.  because why?  Why did they decline it?  And the question is, You know, who was behind that?  Well, that's what Doug Collins gets to here.  And remember, Horowitz, the IG, cannot prosecute.  All he can do is make a referral for prosecution.  He can't do the actual prosecution.  that has to happen in the DOJ.  So somewhere along the line, somebody in the DOJ decided to decline this prosecution.  Okay, so while the DAD is not named in the summary, there are several indications.  the DAD in question is former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok.  That's what I said I thought it was.  For example, the 2018 report noted Peter Strzok is an experienced counterintelligence agent who was promoted to deputy assistant director DAD of the espionage section in September 2016.  The 2018 report also said most troubling on October 29, 2016, Strzok forwarded from his FBI account to his personal email account, an email about the proposed search warrant the mid-year team was seeking on the Weiner laptop.  This email included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, which contained information from the Weiner investigation that appears to have been under seal at the time in the Southern District of New York.  So, yeah.  Peter Strzok, doing some bad stuff here.  According to Figure 3.1 of the 2018 report, no other deputy assistant director was in the FBI chain of command for the mid-year investigation.  And remember, the mid-year investigation was the thing about Hillary Clinton's emails.  The main subject of the 2018 report.  As such, please answer the following questions.  One, is Peter Strzok, the DAD, referenced in the report?  Yeah, I think he should be named, you know.  I think whoever did that, you know, when you're putting something like this out, I don't care.  The guy should be named.  He did something wrong.  You know he did something wrong.  Let's tell the American public who it was.  We deserve to know.  And so number two, was this case referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution?  Well, I assume it was because otherwise it wouldn't say, you know, like it does, it wouldn't say prosecution of the DAD was declined.  But it still could be that he didn't refer him, although I think if it was declined, he would have had to have referred.  But I don't know.  And did the department decline to prosecute?  If so, why?  Here's where he's trying to get to the heart of it and find out exactly where along the chain of command.  Something happened that this guy ended up getting off for what he did, which was obviously something that should have been prosecuted.  Number four, was the appropriate federal court notified an FBI agent disclosed to the media existence of information that had been filed under seal?  If not, why not?  if so what if any action was taken by the court?  additionally last year you testified before the senate judiciary committee.  your office was investigating former fbi director james comey's leaking of memos.  he wrote regarding his conversations with the president.  specifically you testified.  We received a referral on that from the FBI.  We are handling that referral and we will issue a report when the matter is complete, consistent with the law and rules.  To better understand the status of this review, please answer the following question.  5.  Is your office's investigation into James Comey still ongoing?  If not, what was the resolution of your investigation?  If so, when do you anticipate issuing a report on that matter?  Please provide the answers to these questions on or before June 7th.  And then down here, you know, he has the signature.  And again, a copy goes to Jerry Nadler.  So I wanted to share that with you.  And here, you know, the footnote just says, mid-year exam was the internal code name the FBI gave to its investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server.  So that's the case on these two letters.  I think he's asking excellent questions.  This guy does a really good job of getting to the heart of things.  And these two people that he addressed need to let us know what's going on.  Now I understand that they don't usually talk about ongoing investigations, but something's got to happen here.  There's got to be some way to find out what they're doing and I think even Congress needs to know what in the world they're doing if they're investigating some of these things.  because you know these are excellent questions and the public needs to know this.  So I hope that maybe one of these two is going to result in something.  I really hope with the Horowitz one that we see his IG report on Comey.  but again if he recommends them and then the DOJ doesn't prosecute we've got an issue here.  you know this is a real problem.  so I hope that somewhere along the line Barr is going to address this and that instead of just seeing recommendations for prosecution and prosecution of the person was declined.  because this is not the first one you know I've reported on another one.  I hope that we're going to start seeing some actual prosecutions out of this because, you know, as long as these people are seeming to get away with stuff, the people are not going to have any confidence in our intelligence community.  You remember what I think it was Clapper said, you know, that they have seven ways to Sunday to get you back.  Well, guess what?  They're working on it and because they have the media right there with them, they're getting a lot more emphasis and they're putting out a lot more propaganda and people are falling for it because they're not reading these types of things and they're not following what people like Doug Collins are doing to get to the bottom of all this.  So yeah, it's happening, folks, but it is so slow.  The wheels of our government work so slowly, which is a good reason why we should never have them in charge of our health care.  Because, you know, if they go so slowly, you'll be dead before they get around to you and decide, oh yeah, maybe they did need that operation.  But that's for another video.  So that's what I've got for you on this one.  I wanted to share it with you, let you know what's going on, and, you know, cheer on Doug Collins if he's your representative.  Man, give that guy some great kudos because he needs to know that we're behind him.  He's doing an awesome job.  If he's not your representative, most of them have it set up now.  that you can't even send a contact thing to him because they've been getting so much, you know, different mail from different people, I guess.  But yeah, you have to be one of his constituents to actually send him something through the online contact form on his site.  But, you know, you can still go to Twitter and you can encourage him there and, you know, remind him that, yeah, we've got to deal with this whole idea of the incestuous relationship between the intelligence community and the MSM.  Yeah, mainstream media, there needs to be something that breaks this.  You know, I know it's important to expose the corruption and everything, but until we break down the mainstream media, we're never going to see all the corruption taken care of.  We know that the CIA and all of the intelligence community have been working with the mainstream media for years, for decades.  And so we need to have that stranglehold broken.  before we can restore the rule of law because the rule of law has been tainted by conviction by media.  If you do something the media deems is wrong in their eyes they will crucify you and they put it out there so much that people start believing it.  because you know if you repeat a lie long enough people will believe you and so that's what they're doing.  I mean that's how they do things.  and they work together with the intelligence community sometimes to do this.  Now, I am in no way saying everyone in the intelligence community is a bad guy.  Alright?  There are a lot of very good public servants in our intelligence community organizations, but there's still an awful lot who are in it for their own agenda.  and that should bother all of us because they have a lot of power and that power especially in the CIA can go unchecked until we stop the leaks.  it's going to continue the way it is and we need to stop those leaks and we need to prosecute some people who have been leaking, so the American people can see that, yeah, the rule of law is being restored.  And until that happens, I think we're all going to be skeptical about it.  Even though I know what's coming, and I know it's all going to eventually come out, it's still frustrating to me when I see things like that, you know, prosecution declined.  Why?  Why?  Why did you decline prosecution?  Who did it?  I want to know who.  And that's what Doug Collins is talking about in his letters.  He wants to know the same things.  So you go, Doug.  Do it.  You know, find the answers.  Get them to tell you what's going on.  So be patient, patriots.  It's taking a long time, but it's eventually going to get there.  So hang in there.  It's coming.  It's just... I think it was DeGeneva.  Last night I was listening to one of his videos and And he said that within the month, we should be seeing a lot of documents from the D class coming out.  And that's going to be a game changer too.  So it's going to be an interesting summer for us.  And by the way, if you're hearing a humming sound, The fan on my laptop is doing this thing where it seems like only when I'm using my recording program and my video editing program it really kicks into this high gear or something and it makes this horrible whine.  I'm trying to muffle it as much as I can but it's still there and my microphone tends to pick up everything.  I wanted to let you know what's going on.  No, it's not your machinery or anything, and I apologize for it, but I'm trying to figure out some way to mitigate it, but it's not worked yet.  So that's what I've got for you on all of this.  I want to thank you for stopping by, and I'll see you all later. ",
