Nearly all people followed the Judeo-Christian teachings of the creation of the universe, the creation of the human race and of course morality.  However, during the 19th century there was a huge cultural shift sweeping across Europe.  The development of the natural sciences and the works of Darwin cast doubt across the whole Judeo-Christian religion.  People were in fact losing their faith and losing their religion.  Nietzsche, picking up on this cultural shift, declared that God is dead.  He explained, God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him.  how shall we comfort ourselves?  the murderers of all murderers?  wow very dark yes but this perfectly summed up the states europe was in during the enlightenment.  imagine that for centuries people strongly believed in one god that created them.  they believed they were created for a reason that the earth was the center of the universe and they had been placed on this planet by an omnipotent being.  this gave all people a sense of purpose.  No matter how rich or poor, how strong or weak, or how beautiful or ugly, we had all been created by the same God for a specific purpose, and we are all governed by the same moral law, and we are all judged the same way.  And no matter what, we are all equal in front of God, and we are all either rewarded or punished in the afterlife. ",

Firstly, the \u00dcbermensch is psychologically strong, ready to master this life and this world.  The \u00dcbermensch is not concerned with otherworldliness.  The only concern is for this world and this life and everything in it.  Nietzsche saw religious systems, such as Christianity, solely concerned with otherworldliness.  The idea of heaven and the eternal reward.  This otherworldly fulfillment would pull people away from this world.  It would make them distant from our earth and concerned solely with a world that they did not live in.  The \u00dcbermensch will be solely focused on this world.  The \u00dcbermensch will grasp this reality and appreciate it.  i see but most importantly the ubermensch will rise above all morality and values that were once ubiquitous and establish his own values.  the ubermensch will create his own morality.  it will be based on this life that he has led the experiences that he has had.  The \u00dcbermensch will not be controlled by a herd mentality, following the morality of the masses because they have been told what is right and wrong.  The \u00dcbermensch creates morality for themselves.  They define what should be valued.  They live by their own moral code.  The \u00dcbermensch brings their own meaning to a meaningless world.  The \u00dcbermensch dominates their reality. ",

Nietzsche is trying to explain a higher evolved human, but how can a lesser evolved human, who has never come into contact with an \u00dcbermensch, know what one would be like?  So what really is an \u00dcbermensch?  Is this a guess?  Is it a fantasy?  Or perhaps nothing more than Nietzsche's personal opinion on what a superhuman would be?  Yes, I see.  A further criticism would be, if an Ubermensch can in fact define their own morality, how would this work in a world with over 7 billion people?  Let's assume we all reach the ultimate goal and the whole of humanity has become Ubermenches.  We all share this world, so if each person has their own morality and values, then I think it will inevitably lead to clashes.  two different moralities that are inconsistent with each other.

It could be argued that sacred texts are meant to be read and understood metaphorically rather than literally.  But most of all, and what I would argue, religion and God are not synonymous.  You do not have to accept religion to accept God.  And whilst holes have been poked in the Bible, I do not see how you reach the conclusion that God is dead.  The concept of God is greater than any religion.  You can disregard religion, but still keep hold of a belief in God.  So just because science has developed, it does not mean that God is dead. ",
