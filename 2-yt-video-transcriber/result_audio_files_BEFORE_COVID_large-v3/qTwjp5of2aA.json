            "text": "Hey, everybody.  I want to share something with you that I've been very apprehensive to share for quite a while now.  In fact, I've been putting this off, but I feel I can't do that anymore.  The Lord spoke to me and gave me something that He told me to tell everybody.  And I want to tell you how that works with me.  I was alone by myself.  And my wife was in Colorado.  So I had the house to myself.  It was quiet.  I felt like the Lord told me to go wait on him, to go sit and pray.  So I did.  What I do is I go in another room where there's nobody, although in this particular case, nobody was home anyway.  So I get a pencil and paper and I sit down and I pray and then I let the Lord know that I'm listening if there's something that he wants to say to me.  And anything that comes to mind, I write down.  I write down everything.  Now with me, I can just tell you that most of the time, once I start to write a little bit, once something, thought comes to my mind, I start to write that.  Other thoughts just, they just tumble.  you know, until I feel like there's, there's nothing else coming.  That's it.  You know, I just not getting anything.  So that's how I operate.  Now, when the Lord tells me something, I don't take it lightly and I don't speak on the Lord's behalf at all without a great deal of prayer first.  Um, So I have put this off for quite a while and I feel like the Lord's, you know, been like, I'm talking to you.  I told you something, you know, I told you something.  So I'm going to share it with you.  Just want you to be aware that I've prayed about this extensively before I decided to share this with you.  All right.  So it is what it is.  The time of Jacob's trouble is here.  Your country will not turn from its evil, and its destruction is imminent.  You will fear greatly, but I will keep you safe.  You must get your peace from me.  I am your strong tower.  You must warn everyone.  My wrath will be poured out on America, and many will die.  The wicked and the ungodly will perish in this destruction, but I have a remnant in America.  My church will survive and destruction will not find them.  Destruction of America will be swift and leave many reeling in disbelief of an unseen attack by an enemy not known to be capable of destroying a nation such as America.  This will blindside you.  Only I could bring this attack.  America will know that the hand of a holy God that they rejected from their country has swiftly brought them to ruin.  One hour.  One hour and destruction comes.  Secure yourself in me.  Cling to me.  I will protect you.  Though you will be shaken, I have you in the palm of my hand.  Rest there.  Okay, so that's it.  I'm not done yet, though.  That's what the Lord gave me.  Now, I need to say two things.  One, I believe that one hour thing didn't mean an hour from when I wrote this, okay?  Because I wrote this a while back.  I believe what he's stating is that when he decides to act on America within an hour, it'll be over, okay?  Just letting you know that.  That's the impressions I got when I was writing this.  All right, now, I said I don't do anything without a great deal of prayer.  When I got this, I was shaking.  My hands were shaking when I got this.  I am right now.  Anyway, I prayed all that after.
