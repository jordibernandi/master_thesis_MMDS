Let's not forget, 32 months ago, this country did a remarkable and quite rare thing in that our parliament, hundreds of our MPs voted to ask the people to have a once-in-a-generation decision about how our country's governed, about our relationship with the EU, about whether our laws are made through a democratically accountable system in the UK or whether they're made in Brussels.  And the people turned out in extraordinary numbers to take part in that.  The biggest vote for anything, any idea or person in our history was for Leave.  The second biggest vote was for Remain.  It was a hugely engaged referendum, a remarkable thing to occur.  Every party, every major party, promised it would honour that promise.  And now, just as we approach the deadline of it happening, one of the two major parties, supposedly of government in this country, has said, you know what, actually, maybe we didn't mean it, maybe we'd go back on that.  And to tell millions of people, 17.4 million Leave voters, but also the rest of the country, who they told at the election they would honour this outcome, that actually, you know what, If, for opportunistic reasons, it comes up that we might open the door to just having another go, see which version of the people's opinion we'd like to keep getting until we find one we want to be bothered to keep our promise about, I think that's outrageous.

And then in October, there was a judgment in the divisional court that found that the Electoral Commission had also given incorrect advice on what could be spent.  And the result of that is that, effectively, Vote Leave spent about 500,000 more than it was entitled to spend.  And it spent that money in the last week of the campaign on AIQ and Facebook ads.  Now, the referendum was, of course, advisory.  So the question then was, what was Theresa May going to do with that advice?
