For example, one of his most famous hot takes is, if a child crawls towards your ding-dong, that counts as consent.  Yeah, that is the level that we're dealing with right now.  So I haven't watched this video.  I was actually in the process of recording another video when you guys sent me this.  So this is going to be a journey we take together.

That is the shit that I'm criticizing.  I understand that not all have literally diddled kids yet.  Go to therapy.  Goku therapy!  Hey, so it's many hours later and I come here to edit and I realize that I forgot to end the video.  I think I was so angry that I just like rage quit.  This guy that I'm making a response to has been to jail like twice before.  Um, he's been kicked out of his house.  He was banned off of YouTube.  I'm not even sure he's like allowed to be on YouTube.  But alas.  So yeah guys, stay tuned for more videos.  I have a video about heightism coming up.  I have a video about, like I said, female predators and the double standard.  I also have a video about these radical feminists who talk about how they want to get abortions if the baby is a boy.  Yeah.  Just fun stuff.  Fun- Always just fun adventures on this channel.  So yeah, thank you so much to my patrons.  I love you guys.  If any of you want to support the channel and join my Discord, the link is down below.  By the way, I love how my Tulsi poster says, I slut.  Thanks, Photo Booth.  Bye!  Go to therapy.  Go to therapy.  Go to therapy. ",
