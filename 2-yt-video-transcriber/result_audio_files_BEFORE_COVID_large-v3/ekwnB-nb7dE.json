Asylum seekers show up to a port of entry anywhere along the border, they're going to be rejected by a CBP officer and told to get on a list or just tell them to come back at another time or even things like asylum is no longer available to them.  That's under a broad policy known as metering, where CBP illegally turns away people at ports of entry.

People have been raped, kidnapped, extorted, and that policy is designed to prevent them from returning to the U.S.  for a hearing before an immigration judge. ",
