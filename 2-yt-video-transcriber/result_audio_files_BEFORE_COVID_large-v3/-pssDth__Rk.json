            "text": "Yeah, I think this is increasingly a problem, especially for our politics as a country.  The way I think of it, I mean, do you remember the Sarah Jeong controversy where the New York Times hired Sarah Jeong as a writer who had a history, a several year long history of tweeting really vile things about white people, celebrating the fact that white people might stop breeding, for example, things that would be recognized as straightforwardly racist if they were said about black people.  In fact, Candace Owens, retweeted, she copy-pasted Sarah Jeong's tweets, but replaced the word white with black and got banned from Twitter almost instantly and then reinstated, which I think is telling.  Okay, so Yeah, I don't, I mean, so I'm not saying Sarah Jong, I think in the context, in her social context, those kind of tweets are not to be read as statements of eugenic intent or, you know, there's a kind of coded language that they, far left social justice warriors kind of use as a more of a signal of their wokeness rather than a really a commitment to exterminating white people.  But the problem is that if you're sort of a typical middle America white person who watches Fox News and you voted for Trump, maybe you don't like everything about him, and you're watching Fox News and you see New York Times hires writer who has said that she wants white people to stop breeding.  And New York Times did not apologize for this.  Think, nope.  You just have to imagine how that reads to the typical white person who perhaps has concerns about immigration, about changing country.  And the way in which they feel that there's nothing left for them on the left.  At this point, you have the biggest left-wing newspaper, the most respected, hiring a person who is just shamelessly hiring a person without apology, who has just said the most vile things about people that look like you.  And this is a huge problem for our politics.  I mean, you have to wonder why so many people are Trump supporters who know that Trump lies a lot.  They know that he's a scummy person, but they don't care.  because look at the alternative.  I mean, the alternative is just a half of the political spectrum that celebrates their non-existence.  That's a problem politically that is only getting worse and worse.  And yeah, I think it's just.  we have to be willing to call out anti-white racism.  And we can't settle for redefining the word racism. ",

            "text": "Yes.  I mean, that is the most... I mean, imagine, you could do this with any word.  Let's just redefine the word murder to only mean when you kill a black person.  We could do that.  We could decide, we could just decide to come up with a different word, but you can't change the underlying ethical status of an action by redefining it, right?  Like racism, you just call it something else.  It's still just as bad as it was yesterday when you change the terminology.  So yeah, this is an incredibly silly thing that's been done with that word.  And it's having terrible consequences for our politics. ",
