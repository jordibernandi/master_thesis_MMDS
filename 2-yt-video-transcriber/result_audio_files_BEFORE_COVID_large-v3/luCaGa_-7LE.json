About our, our worth, about our level of attractiveness, about our goodness.  We all have these fears that we may not be as good or as worthy or as lovable as we hope we are.  Right.  And so I think extended eye contact, like metaphorically also literally, but sometimes metaphorically, like that's what vulnerability is.  And we're afraid that people may confirm that.  fears mm-hmm you know that like not only are we afraid that someone will reject us for whatever reason we're also afraid that they'll see something in us and confirm our deepest darkest fears about ourselves.  yeah and our and our worthiness or lack thereof or whatever.  so it also comes down to self-love mm-hmm you know and the confidence in that because I think we're all we all have a certain level of doubt right about our worthiness and whether that comes from trauma or just society or the way we're raised or whatever you know like with my dad you know feeling like my lovability would be lessened if i revealed that i was gay.  you know it's like one of those things and then i may feel less lovable if i interpret his reaction to be anything that confirms that fear.  you know and that's i think that's a big part of vulnerability is the like being vulnerable comes down to like being brave, but being brave comes down to having that self love that just, you know, understand.  no matter how that person reacts, I'm still confident in my goodness and my worth, you know?  And I think that's a big part of vulnerability.  Most of us have a really hard time being confident in our worth.  You know, most people kind of, we're, we're all on an edge, you know, and if a bully talks trash about you, then it confirms that ",

For me, talk therapy has been really, really great because it helps me anytime I'm sharing something like, you know, my vulnerabilities.  I have someone who is a safe space to confirm and validate my worth.  And, you know, it's almost like the opposite of the fear, right?  Someone is there to actually say, Hey, no, you are worthy of being loved.  You know, it doesn't matter if you're gay, you know, you are worthy of being loved.  It doesn't matter if you have this, it doesn't matter if you look like this, it doesn't, you know, you have that worth.  So I think for me also a big reason that I have so many walls up personally because I was in relationships with people who did not take care of my vulnerability.

I think it's kind of like learning to swim, right?  Mm-hmm.  It's really scary if you don't know how to swim because there's these deep, dark waters and you don't know if you're going to drown.  You know, there's so much fear.  You don't know what's lurking underneath.  But if you start in the shallow end with an instructor, you know, or a friend who knows how to swim or someone who can be like, here's a little like floaty, use this.  Like eventually you're going to get to the deeper end.  You're going to be able to swim.  You're going to be able to dive deeply and you're not going to be afraid of it.  So I think that, Emotionally like the people in your life, you know, if you have these people who can be safe spaces Then it's a lot easier to learn how to swim alone.  Yeah, or with other people or in the deeper end.  I'm going off on right now.  Yeah for me.  That's that's been Where I've developed the most when it comes to vulnerability. ",
