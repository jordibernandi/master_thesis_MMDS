            "text": "Hi guys, this is a quick public service announcement just to say that involuntary celibates are no longer welcome on reddit.com.  At least not in their own subreddits.  Recently the brain cells subreddit got banned and then sellouts got banned.  So Reddit has made it pretty clear that they don't want incels on their website.  I've just seen a new subreddit come up this weekend or towards the end of this week called Depressed Virgins.  You think that... This is just stupid.  You think that because you don't have the cell, C-E-L, string or characters in your subreddit name that Reddit won't ban you?  They're not banning the name.  It's not the name they have a problem with.  It's the content.  It's upsetting m'ladies.  If you talk about any facts... that are blackpilled and may upset some women or male feminists, then that's what gets you banned, not your name.  So it doesn't matter what you call yourself.  It's pointless.  Depressed virgins.  They tried it with LGBT cells.  That got banned.  Oh, we can't get banned because we've got LGBT in our name.  Yeah, how did that work out for you?  Reddit has made it clear they don't want us there.  Take the hint.  A bunch of us have started to post on saidit.net slash s slash incels.  That's s-a-i-d-i-t dot net slash s slash incels.  Now, I don't know if saidit is a free speech platform.  I don't know where they stand.  I don't know if they're another bunch of cucks like Reddit.  But At least we're not banned from there.  So at least there is some time for us to regroup and think of a contingency plan.  Think of, you know, our next steps.  But on Reddit... People, I've seen on Depressed Virgins, and I've seen it on sellouts before that got banned.  I've seen some posters say, it's starting to feel comfy here.  We've gained a few subscribers.  There's a lot more posts.  Yeah, that's not going to last.  Like, yeah, it feels comfy for about a week.  Then it disappears.  Banned.  Memory hold.  so it's pointless.  this game of whack-a-mole is kind of pointless.  i don't know where you guys i don't know what you guys think that it doesn't.  it doesn't make sense.  like you think that you're gonna make you're gonna come across the right combination of subreddit name and diluted content and um and you're just going to be overlooked by reddit admins.  no no they want you banned.  they don't want you on their site.  so any subreddit that posts facts about women is seen as a continuation of brain cells.  therefore is seen as a ban evasion.  so unless you're going to start talking about flowers and i mean legit.  talking about flowers or you know cats and legit?  no no euphemisms.  no don't try and 4d chess it like you're actually talking about cats or flowers then other than that it's not going to work.  i feel it important to mention that uh there is the option of brain cells or reddit refugees moving to incels.co which is a website completely away from reddit which is under its own set of rules.  but yeah this is more proof that not all incels think alike.  a lot of people from brain cells don't like posters or the content on incels.co or the rules or the ideology or the thinking or the.  you know the culture.  So I can understand that a lot of brain cells former Brain Cells posters don't feel like... It's just a simple... It's just a simple... Just go to incels.co and continue posting there.  It's a completely different website.  The conversation is different.  It's not memes.  It's in-depth discussion.  The culture is different.  But for some Brain Cells posters, that is an option.  but I can understand many brain cells posters don't see that as a fitting alternative.  The thing is, so many important black pills got lost when brain cells got banned.  And if you keep doing this, if you keep creating new subreddits, there may be like an important black pill that's in its infancy about women or dating or men's thirst.  And... When that new subreddit gets banned, so too does that emerging Blackpill.  You're just going to lose more black pills.  You're just going to lose more anecdotes, statistical information.  that is helpful.  So if you do see people posting something insightful, something truthful, something that you think may help men on Reddit, then screenshot it because that's going to go.  that it's going to be memory.  hold so screenshot it.  say right click save as long tap download image screenshot it and keep these black pills alive.  right before I go I am getting a number of emails.  I always do I i'm trying to get to you but i'm just so busy.  basically i work full time and commute over two hours a day and then i may go to the gym after.  so i'm constantly busy like i haven't been.  i haven't been bored to get this since 1999. i haven't been bored for that is legit.  20 years i haven't been bored.  I've always got something to do.  I'm always trying to do two things at once.  Because I don't get to your emails, I'm not ignoring you.  I'm not high and mighty and think I don't need to answer emails.  I just can't get to everyone.  So... Be patient.  I'll try and get to you.  What else before I go?  There is a live stream coming up soon.  That's going to be in November because I don't have time to make the content for it yet.  I think the guests are going to be really good because they don't see... eye to eye on many things.  so there is there's.  there is going to be some good debate going on.  uh but apart from that yeah go to said it dot net slash s slash incels and just leave the cock website alone.  they don't want you anymore.
