            "text": "There's this website called faithwire.com.  Just discovered it.  I assume it's complete BS because it seems like a super Christian website.  But the title of this article is, There Has to Be Something Outside Us.  Prominent agnostic podcaster admits openness to Jesus.  Dave Rubin is a theist.  Come to find out.  Dave Rubin believes in God.  I don't know if you guys know Dave Rubin.  Let me give you a little bit of background on Rubin.  Years and years ago, like before I started my YouTube channel, maybe a year or two before, there were a lot of atheist YouTubers around at that time.  Armored Skeptic, Logic, who is still around in the atheist sphere.  Just a whole bunch.  There were a whole bunch of atheist YouTubers at the time.  And they were talking about Kent Hovind and a bunch of other subjects like that, right?  Atheistic subjects.  Well, over time, they started to move in a more anti-SJW direction.  Thunderfoot's another good example.  I followed them there.  I followed them the whole way.  I was like, yeah, you know, SJWs, they're evil and all that other stuff.  Like, I was an anti-SJW for a while.  After some time, I started to realize that they were very much going over the top.  They were full of shit.  Now, I've said this before, but SJWs have their problems too.  And that's why I don't call myself an SJW.  I call myself an advocate for social justice, not a social justice warrior.  That means I believe in women's rights, I believe in trans rights, I believe in gay rights, the whole nine yards.  Inclusivity all the way.  But I don't believe in calling people out by name, shaming people, cancel culture, other things like that, right?  So I kind of stopped watching Sargon, stopped watching Armored Skeptic and all of the others who were anti-SJWs, Thunderfoot and things like that.  But around that time, Dave Rubin was part of the Young Turks Network.  And they're a liberal network.  They're like a liberal YouTube channel, YouTube network.  He was a liberal, Dave Rubin was.  And added some interesting insight to the subjects.  Well, eventually, he ended up leaving the Young Turks to create the Rubin Report, his own show.  And that thing just took off.  I think on his first episode, he had Sam Harris on.  And, uh... It got really big, really fast.  I think he's in the millions of subscribers now or something like that.  He had this complete political shift from left wing to right wing.  Like now he is right wing.  I'm comfortable saying that.  He says he's a classical liberal or a libertarian, I think.  But he's been on PragerU videos, which I haven't debunked one of those in a while.  I would like to sometime soon.  Maybe count that as coming in the pipeline.  But they are like an extremist right-wing Christian organization.  And the fact that he's hitching his wagon to PragerU at the very least tells me that he's not a full liberal anymore.  It's just, it's really bizarre to me.  Like, just look at the title of this.  Dave Rubin says that he's a theist now.  So he has called himself an atheist in the past.  Now, we're going to get to the article in a second.  But at one point in time, he called himself atheist.  And now he's a theist.  So he went from liberal to right-wing atheist.  And now he's gone from atheist to theist.  It's like one of those shifts in a person's lifetime is bizarre in itself.  But two of those shifts, like basically back to back, like what happened in this dude's life that brought him to these conclusions?  I don't know.  It's like mind blowing to me.  It's like a Christian converting from like being a pastor to being a Muslim religious leader.  It happens, but it is fucking bizarre when it does.  It is strange.  It's like when an adult comes out and tells you that they believe that Santa Claus is literally real.  This is a one-way street for me.  I can't speak for any other atheists, but I have seen Christianity and the things that Christianity does, and it's just like... I cannot take it seriously.  I can't.  I would love to.  I mean, I released a video earlier called My Grandfather Has Lung Cancer.  You guys probably saw that video.  I would love to believe that this isn't the end of the line.  I just can't.  I mean, think about what would happen if tomorrow I came out and said, I'm a Christian.  I would be rich.  I'd be paraded around by Kent Hovind and Ken Ham and Ray Comfort and all of those guys.  I mean, they'd buy me a mansion.  So there's plenty of incentive there for me to be a theist, but I can't because I don't believe it.  It's not a choice.  It's a conclusion that I've made.  I can't choose to believe something different.  It's just very strange to me when people come out and say that they became a theist after being a prominent atheist in the community.  Like, look at what happened with... Earlier I said I don't do public callouts.  Don't consider this a callout.  I mean, this guy came out and said it on his channel anyways.  Computing Forever, the YouTube channel Computing Forever.  He was like a prominent atheist in the community.  He talked about atheistic and religious arguments in debates and things like that.  And now he's a Christian, like a full-blown Christian.  I truly don't understand how that happens.  I'm trying so hard to wrap my head around this, and I just cannot.  Anyway, let's read the article.  Like I said, this is from a religious website, so let's see what they have to say.  One of the most successful podcasters and YouTube hosts today has admitted that he feels an affinity with the person of Jesus Christ.  Okay, I actually listened to it.  I don't remember him mentioning Jesus specifically.  I feel like he just said he was a theist, that he believed in God, or said that there could be something there, like weak theism.  I didn't think that he went as strong as saying Christianity because he grew up Jewish.  Why would he talk about Jesus?  Anyway, whatever.  Let's continue on.  Dave Rubin, who hosts the Rubin Report, was discussing matters of faith with Christian apologist Professor John Lennox as part of the Big Conversation Debate series organized by Premier Christian Radio.  Okay, John Lennox, I actually know who that is.  He's been in a lot of Christian debates.  He's, I think, a PhD mathematician or something.  A bigger guy, that's him right there.  If you're watching the podcast on YouTube, you'll get to see a picture of him.  Seems like an okay, nice enough guy, but yeah, he's super, super Christian.  And he debates atheists a lot.  Held before a 1,000 strong audience at Cavalry Chapel in Costa Mesa, California, the pair discussed the open question, is God dead?  Kind of a weird question, but okay.  Rubin was raised in a culturally Jewish home and in the past had described himself as an atheist, but later hedged on that description and seemed to indicate agnostic was more befitting.  Now, however, he has opened up about the profound impact that Christians have had on his life and how they have caused him to explore the faith.  I would say as I've sat down with believers, this is a quote by Rubin, I would say as I've sat down with believers and non-believers alike, I've genuinely found the believers not only more welcoming, but more open, actually happier, less dependent on things outside of themselves, more self-reliant, he said during the discussion.  On Jesus himself, Reuben said he has no problem with him, but actually rather likes the guy.  Likes the guy, okay.  I like the message of Jesus.  I love these ideas, he added.  I think that if my life becomes a continuing conversation about these things, I can incorporate the best parts of that to be a better person.  Spending a lot of time with renowned Canadian academic Jordan Peterson this year, Rubin said he profoundly impacted by the deep biblical influences that underpin Peterson's philosophy and worldview.  I think they left a word out there.  talking about his biblical lectures and his perspective on life that there has to be a bedrock of something that's real and true outside of us.  it moved me.  reuben explained i'm secular in my life but i've found in the last year that there has to be something outside of us.  the rest of this makes no sense.  Like I was saying before, it sounds like he moved from a weak atheist position, like not really super confident in that position to a weak theist position.  Like, yeah, maybe there must be something outside of us, that kind of thing.  So it's a little bit less kind of like absurd, for lack of a better term, to me that he moved over on this issue because he really didn't move that much.  But when I see somebody like Computing Forever go full-blown Christian, it blows my mind.  When I see a Muslim convert to Christianity, it blows my mind.  They're like so different from each other.  Both of those two ideas, both of those two ideologies, Christianity and Islam, are opposed to each other.  They don't like each other.  They don't get along.  and they're both.  they can both be very extreme.  i can see the logical progression from i'm being attacked by this group of people.  oh these people literally want to shut down free speech or something like that.  and and i can see the logical progression to um slightly more right-wing ideas and then getting even more and more right-wing until you're a full-blown anti-sjw and then you're getting into the economics of the right wing and things like that.  like.  I can see that logical progression because I went through that myself.  Now I recognize that it's not logically sound, but I just cannot wrap my head around the logical progression from being a prominent atheist to being a Christian.  Just like the Flat Earth Movement, I can't wrap my head around how that works.  How do people come to those conclusions?  It's just really strange.

But if you want to get something back for your support, you can check out my Teespring.  I'm trying to make a shirt design for every cult I've covered.  I haven't gotten every one, but I'm working on it.  So check it out and see if your cult is up there.  Second, you can support me by checking out my game shop.  I sell controller, cartridge, and game box stands for every system from the original Nintendo and Sega Game Gear to the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.  So give that a look too.  And finally, if you want to support me in some way other than monetarily, you can check out my other YouTube channels.  I have a retro game channel where I answer questions like why does Shy Guy have a mask and why are CRT TVs the best way to play retro games?  I also have the podcast where I talk about stuff I don't feel I can say on a monetized channel.  And finally, I have my main channel where I talk about cults.  I wish I didn't have to worry about dancing around subjects carefully in the first place, but I chose to do this as a full-time job, so unfortunately, I rely on YouTube's AdSense.  and on the support of patrons to continue doing the work I do.  Anyways, check me out in all those places if you haven't already.  Thanks for listening, guys. ",
