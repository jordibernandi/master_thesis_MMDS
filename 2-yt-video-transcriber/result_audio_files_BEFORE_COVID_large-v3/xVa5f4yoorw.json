If anything changes or he takes off or anything or he starts engaging, would you give us a call, please?  He's here.  Just spotted him.  Same car, same license plates.  You were the one that was assaulted?  Yes, sir.  We like him arrested.  I mean, he pointed a deadly weapon at me, pointed right at my face. ",
