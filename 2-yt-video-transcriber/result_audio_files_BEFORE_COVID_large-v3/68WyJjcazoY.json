It's super comfortable and I got kind of tired of doing videos in my office with the studio lights and the white wall.  I feel like I looked really blown out and like not like myself and kind of like a sex robot.  Even more so than usual.  So yeah, change of scenery.  So today's video is a bit dark.  No racial.  But first, it'd be wrong of me to not say thank you so much to everyone for the success of the last merch launch from last week.  You guys really took to the pronoun shirts, which are still available now.  I actually made them into stickers and mugs and other accessories.  I was a little blown away by how many of you got that.  And they are still available, but they are limited edition.  So thank you to everyone who shopped at my store.  But now on to the video.  everyone's been asking me to talk about this.  there is a huge increase recently being reported in the number of teenagers and young people detransitioning. ",

            "text": "So honestly you guys, this is to me the logical conclusion of the sort of popularizing and turning gender and transitioning and trans into a fad.  I feel like it makes all the sense in the world that there are now young people coming out and feeling that they you know, fell into a label that's not really them, which is the T-label.  Unfortunately, unlike being emo, is that even still a thing?  Am I that old?  I don't know.  Or goth or, you know, falling into a different side of trend.  that's more about fashion or whatever, transitioning and being transgender has a lot of times very permanent consequences.  consequences that when you are 13, 14, 15 years old, you don't really have a concept of it.  You don't really have a concept when you're that young of permanence.  And this is not to sound condescending or like young people are dumb.  That's not it.  It is literally just a scientific fact that our brains are not developed enough to the point to make those types of huge decisions at that age.  And I'm gonna be so real, I feel like it's extremely dangerous and scary what I'm seeing on the internet these days, which is treating transgender as though it is gender expression, fashion, although it is something to just be thrown around lightly because it's really, really not.  Take it from me, okay?  Take it from grandma.  Tran-ma.  Going through my transition, I had started at 20.  The effects of hormones on your mind, on your mood, on your behavior, on your mental state, your emotional state is so heavy and people don't talk about that.  You go through a lot and trivializing it and treating trans as a fad is really, really dangerous.  So I'm gonna read this message, don't judge my dirty laptop, from this girl who sent me this really heartfelt message on Instagram.  I wanted to be a boy when I was 9 to 11 years old.  I had been bullied very badly in school and remember looking at boys and how they didn't get messed with by mean girls.  I started dressing in my brother's clothes and even requested to be called Andy.  Thing is, I was not experiencing gender dysphoria.  I was simply trying to protect myself by emulating what I viewed as stronger than me.  I think a lot of people go through these phases as children and teens and they are now mistaking it for gender dysphoria.  To this day, even as very feminine presenting, I have a very masculine personality, most likely as a residual shield as the bullying never stopped.  People need to hear more of these stories because we can have feminine and masculine traits wrapped up in one person without being trans or non-binary.  And I completely agree with this girl who sent this message and I get so many people messaging me saying, I thought I was a girl when I was 10.  I thought I was a boy.  Now I'm an adult and I'm happy and I'm so glad that I didn't have parents who threw me on hormones or threw me on blockers.  You know, that is where we're at with all of this.  Tragic.  Now, I really want to tell you guys a very personal story.  And this goes out to all the young people or older people who message me on a daily basis, which is a lot of you guys, questioning if you're trans, questioning if what you're feeling means you have dysphoria, questioning if that is a life choice that you should be making.  And I never feel comfortable telling people, yes, this makes you trans or yes, this means you're feeling this because I'm not inside your mind or your heart and I really can't tell.  What I can tell you is my story, how I knew that I was trans and how I needed to transition for my well-being, for the optimization of my quality of life.  was I was at a really low point, you guys.  I moved to Michigan when I was 20 for a boyfriend.  Didn't work out, obviously.  And there's something about moving away from all your friends and your family and your sort of normal day-to-day routine that really lends an introspective sort of new look on things.  And I had always experienced gender dysphoria, but I didn't know transitioning was the right move for me.  I was scared.  I didn't know, like, what am I going to look like afterwards?  You know, what's it going to be like?  Am I going to die during surgery?  Like, is the world going to reject me?  Am I going to end up unemployed because no one will hire some freak?  Like, those were all very real thoughts in my head.  And those are the thoughts that you guys express to me all the time in messages.  So I think I'm speaking to you guys right now.  My relationship with this guy was falling apart.  I was realizing, you know, I have to focus on me because no one's going to take care of me.  No one's going to make my dreams happen.  No one's going to make me happy or comfortable with myself.  So I'm going to do it on my own.  And before I called my mom, who was back in California, and had the guts to tell her, I'm transgender, I need to get back to California, and I need help with this, was I asked myself, how do I picture myself in 50 years?  60 years?  At age 50, 60, 70... In the casket, I literally pictured all of it.  And for me, again, I was 20 years old, the thought of aging as a man was extremely distressing to me.  The thought of having this expectation of living the societal role as a man, you know, a husband and kids and having a wife and like that really deeply scared me.  And I was in a really dark place with this, you guys.  I remember having so much fear and trepidation.  But I tell you guys this specific story of picturing yourself at a later age because I feel like oftentimes very, very young people don't have the capacity to really picture what their life could possibly be at 50 or 60.  I feel like people don't treat transitioning and being trans as a permanent life choice not just next year not just through high school not just through your young adulthood when you are about to go in the casket and they're putting you in and they give your name at the funeral.  that's what you need to start thinking about and maybe that's morbid maybe that's dark but that's real.  it is not something to be used to look cute.  how you look honestly has almost nothing to do with it.  i don't really believe in souls and higher power and all that.  that's just me.  no offense to anyone who does but the best way I can describe it as, it has to do with your soul.  It has to do with who you are to your effing core.  You know, transitioning really helped me.  I feel like transitioning opened my entire life up.  Like, I owe so much of my happiness today to having the balls, no pun intended, to transition, right?  It was right for me.  When I transitioned, it was to alleviate gender dysphoria.  Specifically, it was to alleviate that horrible feeling.  And guess what?  For 99% of it, it worked.  I very rarely feel dysphoric.  I'm a success story.  I transitioned and I'm extremely happy.  So I'm also not trying to paint a picture that that is something that can happen for you or the person you love that's going through this.  But what I am saying is just be sure.  Don't take it lightly.  But!  I think that's it for this video, you guys.  Thank you so much for watching.  Hit the subscribe button.  You know you want to.  You know you want to.  And if you've already hit the subscribe button but not the bell, hit the bell.  You know you watch my videos anyways.  You might as well get a notification about it.  Follow my socials because YouTube is so annoying and half the time won't notify you when I upload unless you're following my Twitter and my Instagram.  And I'll see you in the next video.  Bye, guys.  Thank you. ",
