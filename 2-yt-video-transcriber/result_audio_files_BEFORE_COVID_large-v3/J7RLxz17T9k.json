And even after capitalism, though we probably won't refer to it as capital, monetary investment or some sort of resource investment is a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of any institution.  I'm just, all right, just point that one out.  Yeah, why does this dude have cent bags?  These aren't even dollar bags, dude.  He's just got like pennies in here.  What the fuck?  Actually, the thing that I want to know most is why did they do this pixel art style and then upscale the resolution?  I don't know if you guys can see it as well because I'm seeing it on my monitor, but the pixel art is like really jagged and there's like there's a like a fuzzy like artifacting going on at the edges of certain corners as though they didn't actually draw the image in a 1920 by 1080 panel.

Every time capitalists defend the concept of capitalism, they don't attack the actual thing that distinguishes capitalism from socialism.  So... What they're doing right here is throwing together, they're unifying capital with the means of production.  So the fact that capital is used to purchase, reinvest in such and such, the means of production is not in dispute.  However, the implication is here that without capital or without the system of capital existing as it currently does, there would be no means of production.  When in fact the means of production has existed in some form or another for as long as humanity has existed.  I guess maybe not when we were all hunter-gatherers, but even then you could argue like a tanning rack or something, a spear.  They're not actually, they're arguing a position that nobody else would attack. ",

            "text": "I like how she's offered one potential solution to rent being too high, which is rent control.  She was told it was wrong, and the guy made a one-off comment about the expense of government regulations, and then she steps back and she's like, oh, well, why does the horrible government keep enforcing these regulations that cost so much money then without trying another idea?  Like, for example, you know, government subsidized housing or mandatory house zoning laws.  Or here's an excellent idea.  Here, real quick, real quick.  Let's finish the video first.  Oh, wonderful.  Thank you.  Here's a really quick one.  Did you know that all cities have... infinitely more empty houses than they do homeless people.  I know you've heard that stat before.  There's a ton of empty houses, like a huge number of them.  You know why?  It's because in these places where land is so expensive, you know that you can buy that land and build a property there, even if it's never used, just sitting on it increases its value as rent prices increase, as land prices increase.  Essentially meaning that it is an investment.  Except it's not just a regular investment.  It's an investment that physically keeps people who live in that city from occupying that space.  So it's like an investment except it hurts people.  And the people who make those investments will push and lobby to keep more houses from being built to preserve the interest they get on their investment.  Because if more houses are built, that will decrease the rate at which land prices increase and therefore make their property less worthwhile.  So it's kind of like an investment, except it hurts people and it means you push for political policies that hurt even more people in the long run, potentially millions of people.  So we have cities that are unaffordable to the people who need to live within those cities to keep it functional.  I mean, even the wealthiest parts of town need service workers, do they not?  They can't all be filled by 16 year olds.  We have cities that refuse to push outward and expand their housing projects because of the lobbying being done by people who are already benefiting from the sky-high land prices, and you have investors who are speculating on houses by buying land and not opening it up to use, allowing their investment to increase in price while simultaneously preventing more houses from being built, making sure that everything stays expensive into perpetuity.  This is a highly ineffective system, highly, highly, highly ineffective system that can be addressed with government housing, or with a push for more land zoning, if you could get it past the state or city legislator.  These are policies that can really help folks in the long run.  The more houses that are being built, the more highways, the more metro that's being built, the more we expand, the more we make our cities accessible to those who need to live there, the better they are for those who want to live there.  And that's something we should all look forward to, because the more people are in a city, the more economic production there is, too.  Everyone benefits in the long run.  The only people, only people, who don't immediately benefit are a tiny subset of the population that makes an extraordinary amount of money off of speculation from the prices of land and rent.  Landlords, landowners.  Fuck them.  What is land zoning?  Yeah, land zoning is when you determine what can be built on a plot of land.  Like, you know how when you drive through a city, some sections of it are dedicated to houses, and some sections of it are dedicated to office buildings, and some sections of it are dedicated to skyscrapers?  That zoning is being determined by the city when they decide what other people are or are not allowed to build there.  A great example that exhibits every point Vosh makes is L.A Well, I was born in  L.A.,  so it makes sense that I'd be familiar with the problems inherent to this system. ",
