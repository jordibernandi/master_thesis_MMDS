And today, on boards at 4chan.org slash poll, here on Politically Incorrect, a brilliant move, perhaps one of the most brilliant moves I've ever seen in an extremely long time, 4D chess.  You see, some anon has posted signs, Around a small town in Winchester, Massachusetts, the sign says, Islam is right about women.  Operation slash I-I-R-A-W slash.  Now here's a little meme to accompany it.  Here's a picture of an NPC.  Islam good.  Women good.  Islam good.  Women good.  And so on and so forth.  Two contradictory beliefs.  Here is a sign that says, Islam is right about women.  And the NPC's brain explodes in short circuits.  Now, what does this mean?  Well, it's very simple, my friends.  Islam is a religion that places women as second-class citizens.  Islamic states do not tolerate homosexuality, they do not tolerate women, they treat women as second-class citizens, and, well, there's a lot to unpack, because Islamic society is very, very regressive, and the antithesis of everything that progressives and the left claims to stand for.  They are not tolerant, they are hateful, and they punish those who sin.  But before we look at the story, monetization on my channel is completely disabled.  I'm 100% viewer supported.
