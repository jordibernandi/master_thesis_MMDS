            "text": "Regular followers of this channel will know that I'm currently pursuing two civil cases against Derbyshire Police.  The first is against Officer Snowflake who brought a malicious prosecution against me for saying no shit to him.  And the second claim is against this huge pile of moron that jumped me in the high street for refusing to be detained by a PCSO who had no powers to detain.  both these claims are in varying stages of proceedings but in bringing them derbyshire constabulary like most forces has done everything it can to lie deceive and obstruct.  If you're like most people and someone who rarely ever encounters the police, then you won't be familiar with just how institutionally corrupt they are and how casually and regularly they lie to get their way.  So in this video, I'm going to show you some proven examples of police dirty tactics, and I'm also going to explain why it's so easy for the police to lie and get away with it.  Police corruption isn't confined to shadowed corridors and Masonic handshakes.  It is practiced brazenly in the open because police culture has developed in such a way to make back covering a primary part of the service.  The police enjoy such a broad immunity from their own negligence or malice, they've developed a slate of unofficial malpractices they can draw upon whenever they need the truth to go south and to save their own worthless hides from disciplinary action.  These dirty tricks are well-worn hand-me-downs practiced and perfected by police officers for generations and guaranteed to ensure that no matter how obvious it is to you and I that the police have interfered with evidence, to themselves and those that claim to hold them to account, this brazen criminality is always dismissed as an honest mistake whereby nobody but the system itself is ever held to blame.  So this starts with the first place.  I tell everyone to start.  who's intended to bring a civil claim against the police by making a subject access or a freedom of information request.  Subject access if you don't know is a valuable part of your data protection rights and entitles you to request pretty much any type of data the police have collected on you.  If it names you or at least identifies you in some way it can be considered personal data and is disclosable.  This means you can obtain all sorts of obscure data from the police that most members of the public and the police are clueless.  you have access to, such as police notebooks, incident logs, CCTV footage of the custody suite, police radio traffic, all of which is recorded, police phone calls, emails, referrals, on and on it goes.  If it mentions you, the chances are you can obtain a copy of it.  Freedom of information entitles you to obtain information held by public authorities that can be considered to be public domain and does not in general relate to personal data.  So for instance in relation to this incident the first thing I needed was a copy of the official authorization that had to be enforced before a PCSO could issue a dispersal notice.  So as it was a public document it was available under freedom of information.  Derbyshire Constabulary's Information Department took a different stance.  Not only did they fail to submit a copy of the authorisation as requested, they attempted to selectively summarise it instead.  Not satisfied with this, I repeated my request for the documents.  Begrudgingly, they eventually submitted them to me.  However, when I opened them, I saw the words RELEASE FOR FOI stamped all over the pages.  The purpose of this was lost on me.  What need was there to declassify a public document?  But when I looked closer, I noticed the words had conveniently covered the expiration timestamp of the document.  It was this timestamp that proved the authorisation had lapsed five minutes before I'd been stopped by the PCSO.  In other words, this document, in its unobliterated form, would have proven conclusively I'd been falsely imprisoned and unlawfully harassed.  But thanks to the police's choice positioning of a needless deauthorisation, the document was useless.  Now, if I was a paranoid type, I would have assumed this to be a deliberate attempt by the Information Department to obscure evidence.  But for now, I was willing to put it down as an administrative oversight.  Then came request number two, in which I asked for the body-worn video of all the PCSOs that were in attendance during the incident.  Most notably, I wanted the footage captured by PCSO Hodor and his square-jawed female colleague, because I knew one of those cameras would have captured him placing his hand upon me and attempting to use false to prevent me from leaving, something he had no legal authority to do in relation to issuing a dispersal notice.  To this end, the information department sent me no fewer than three recordable DVDs over a period of a month.  not only would these discs not play they wouldn't even be recognized in any system.  naturally when i brought the matter up with the head of the information department he feigned ignorance.  he even went as far as to suggest that in all his years as an information officer he had never sent out a single recordable dvd that had failed.  That's some tall claim.  He must be the most blessed information officer in history, because I worked in the video industry for most of my life, and I know exactly how unreliable DVD-Rs are as a medium.  Getting them to play in one device is fairly routine, but getting them to play in a range of devices is nigh on impossible.  But strangely, the chief information officer never asked what device I'd attempted to play them in, even though I'd tried four different devices.  I assume now that they were attempting to do something I've only recently discovered is a favourite tactic of information officers who wish to avoid disclosing body-worn video that contains irrefutable evidence that works against the police.  Firstly, they select some non-incriminating parts of the requested video they think is safe for release and omit the rest.  That can always form part of a corrupted file or hardware error should an additional excuse be needed.  In this case, they chose to release only PCSO Hodor's footage and to keep Squarejaw's back.  This is because the lens in these body-worn videos have such a narrow field of view, you can't see what the police's hands are doing at all time.  yeah like that's by accident.  so in hodor's footage his hands fall out of view when he grabs me and all you get is a big close-up of my face and chest but square jaw's footage was pointed at both of us from a distance and should have captured everything.  Of course, by the time the information department had finished sending me 40 discs, 30 days had passed.  This meant by the time I discovered that the necessary footage is missing, the police can claim the footage has now been destroyed in keeping with data protection regulations.  This is because body-worn video is deleted every 30 days as standard, even though footage that gives rise to a complaint should be retained as long as necessary.  Nice try, Darbyshire Constabulary.  It's just a shame you didn't examine the footage.  you did disclose a little harder, because if you had, you would have seen my reflection captured in the shop window, where Hodor can be seen putting his hands up against me despite my trying to walk away.  So how did the Professional Standards Department and subsequently the IOPC deal with this unfortunate evidence?  Simple.  They just ignored it altogether.  Refused to so much as acknowledge it.  In fact, the original investigating officer even refused to watch all the footage captured from my camera phone because, as the IOPC later opined, he didn't expect to find anything in it that differed from the PCSO's account.  Of course he didn't.  It already made his mind up what to expect and that was anything that led to the desired outcome of excusing all officers of blame.  As a result, the footage of this lying hate-filled thug pushing his body weight onto my foot as an unofficial restraint tactic was never viewed either.  This despite me mentioning it several times during the incident and my capturing a shot of him doing so.  But the IOPC lie factory kicked into force and dismissed it on appeal by stating PC Marshall states that he had no recollection of stepping on your foot.  but if he had, it would have been accidental.  In the YouTube footage at one point, you briefly point your camera downwards, and a police officer's foot can be seen apparently hovering over your own.  However, it does not land, does not stay there, and there are no cries of pain, which I would expect if the officer had stood on your foot with his full body weight.  This leads me to conclude that there is insufficient evidence to establish that there was a deliberate and prolonged attempt to stand on your foot.  Of course, my video proof wouldn't be enough.  It contradicts the only evidence that the IOPC will grade above reality itself, and that's an officer's word, which is, of course, divine.  Still, that's nothing compared to how they excused Hodor's refusal to show his designation card at the start of our encounter, which he is required to show by law.  Guess who was to blame for that failure?  Me, of course.  PCSO Lusick states that he has requested your name in order to check your name on the police systems and you became immediately aggressive and came towards him, which has caused him to put out his hand in self-defence in order to prevent you from getting any closer as he was unsure what you would do next.  Yeah, because we can see here in the video me lunging for him.  And what his steel sprung like reflex is, is he protects himself from my vicious attack.  What, you didn't see it?  That's because it never happened.  He states that this has caught him off guard, and when you repeatedly asked for his designation card, he has misunderstood you, as he claims he was under stress, and he did not understand that you wanted to view his powers booklet, which he is aware that he is required to show a request, and he showed you his identity card, which he thought you were referring to.  Oh, well, that's all right then.  Silly me for not knowing the term.  designation card was too long a word for this village idiot, despite it being its official name.  Perhaps I should have used a more appropriate nursery school term and described it as My Little Pony's Magic Powers Bookie Wookie.  Which brings me nicely to the third failure of the information department.  I asked for a copy of the card and for information surrounding the requirement to carry them.  This time they disclosed as much disinformation as possible in the hope I would swallow this sleeping pill of bullshit and go away nicely sedated.  PCSOs in Derby, they claimed, don't carry paper designation cards, but they might just have a copy on their handheld electronic devices.  Sensing that this reply had been polluted by executive interference, I approached a group of PCSOs in the city centre a few days later, none of whom had ever seen me before.  I asked them if they carried designation cards, and sure enough, they presented newly minted cards and kindly allowed me to take a picture of one.  A PCSO also admitted, we have to carry designation cards, it's the law.  A statement backed up by section 42.1 of the Police Reform Act.  So far, we have a hat trick of incompetence or deliberate interference all from the same department.  Obliterated authorization, missing camera footage, and misinformation on designation cards.  And if that isn't enough, we reached the straw that broke the camel's back.  In reference to the Officer Snowflake incident, I was curious as to at which point he decided to prosecute me.  Before or after he discovered I ran a website and YouTube channel critical of the police.  For that matter, had any other officers been checking my name on the PNC for their own personal reasons?  So I made a subject access request for audit data on the PNC that referred to me.  Now by that, I do not mean asking the police for a copy of PNC records.  Instead, I want to know the names, column numbers, dates and reasons behind any search made against my details on the PNC.  Let me explain that in depth because you might find this quite interesting.  And this bit is my gift to everyone who's watched the video this far.  The PNC, like most police databases, are monitored by audit trail appliances, something like the black boxes they store in passenger aircraft.  These boxes log every keystroke entered and in so doing assign a unique audit number to the activity.  This audit trail is viewable only to those with access to a secure portal.  But most importantly, nothing and no one can delete the data once it's stored.  It is incorruptible even when installed with an institution as shady as the police service.  Now the PNC can only be accessed by providing an employee identification number as well as given a reason why the database is being accessed.  Now of course police officers have developed certain shortcuts to abuse these systems without bringing attention to themselves such as typing in a generic purpose for accessing the police system that has widely drawn parameters.  However, once inside, the audit system monitors every record and every document they access, which is significant considering.  the PNC in turn links to the Police National Database, which is the largest database in the whole of Britain.  If a cop has been using police systems for shady purposes, the audit trail appliance will capture it.  And as the audit trail might relate to your personal records, that means the audit itself becomes personal data and is accessible under subject access laws.  So I made a subject access request for this data and guess what I got back?  Nothing.  That's right, absolutely nothing.  The reason for this?  Because my name appeared nowhere on police systems, apparently.  So how could an experienced information officer, whose sole job is to retrieve information from police systems all day, every day, cannot even perform a simple name search on the PNC without screwing it up?  Well, by now I was thoroughly sick of it all.  this wasn't a deliberate attempt to obstruct the flow of information I was entitled to, then it was total incompetence, either of which are of serious cause for concern.  So I typed out a list of all my options at this stage and then sent them on to the Information Department.  I also pointed out that if this was a deliberate attempt to help their policing colleagues evade accountability, then I could by rights bring a private prosecution against them under Section 26 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act.  Within 48 hours, I got a response.  The audit data I'd originally requested was attached alongside a litany of excuses for why the first information officer had failed to do a job properly, all of which insulted my intelligence.  Of course, the audit wasn't a proper audit and instead they'd attached some random entries from the Police National Database in the hope I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Unsurprisingly, any searches made by Officer Snowflake were absent from this audit.  Well, just to prove that I was not going to let their incompetence go unchallenged, I made another subject access request.  This time for audit data in relation to the last search where no record was found.  That would, after all, prove whether or not the Information Department had attempted to do their job properly, or if they were lying to me.  Two guesses what happened to that request.  Spoiler alert, they ignored it.  So this leaves me with no other recourse except to hit up the Information Commissioner's office with a complaint and ask them to investigate.  Is this all a deliberate act of sabotage or is it just good old-fashioned police incompetence?  You decide.  The fact is the police have ensured that the two are indistinguishable from each other so as to make it nigh on impossible to hold them liable for corruption.  Also, bear in mind that during the course of this video I've only hinted at some of the laughable fiction that has been puked out by the PSD and the IOPC in their bid to protect all officers from accountability.  How the police complaints process distorts reality and reason to psychotropic proportions is a comedy that I'll save for a later video.  The battle goes on, but remember this is just one department I'm dealing with here.  And when you take into account all the other areas of police obstruction and interference I have to deal with, you can see now why fighting police corruption has become a full-time job for me. ",
