            "text": "Ms.  Ronning, you also said that nine out of 10 major banks are supportive of the direction the OCC is heading.  Are you familiar with the American Bankers Association?  I am.  The top 10 banks in the country are all members of the ABA, and yet the ABA itself has put out a statement, which I have here and I'm happy to submit for the record.  May I submit this to the record?  Without objection, such is the order.  The ABA said we continue to believe that the nation would be best served by a final interagency rule that also includes the Federal Reserve, which would provide a consistent regulatory framework for all banks.  That's the ABA statement.  Yet you recently said 9 out of 10 of the major banks are supportive of the OCC proposal.  I'm confused, Mr.  Otting.  Which major banks were you talking about?  Is this like a toothpaste commercial where 9 out of 10 dentists agree? ",

What they said in that letter is their preference would be that the three regulatory agencies come together on a final rule.  That's one comment in that letter.  The other comment is the banks deciding that they would like to move forward.  They have issues and we've asked them to comment on those issues. ",
