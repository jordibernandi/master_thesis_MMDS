As you're looking at the magnetopause, which represents the shields of our planet, the Earth is in the center, in the white circle, and the white side of that circle indicates the sun-facing side, and that would be the side that you see this energy coming from.  For the last few days, we've seen this compress like you're seeing it now, but now we're starting to see something that has not happened, since january of this year and that was when cern shut down on january the 7th.  you're getting some side angle burn off also because normally this would be blowing straight back but that's uh that indicates that um there's more involved here than just solar wind which is very low.  we're dealing with magnetics.  but look at this distortion now guys we have not seen this now going on since january.  cern shut down with the message that they would see us next year but guys that.
