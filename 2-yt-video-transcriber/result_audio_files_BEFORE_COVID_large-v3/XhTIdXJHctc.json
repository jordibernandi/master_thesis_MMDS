Read Julian Mayfield's essays on Baldwin.  Julian Mayfield was an anti-colonial, anti-imperialist leftist.  Trashing Baldwin.  The only people who actually fell in love with Baldwin early on were liberal whites, disproportionately liberal Jews who facilitated his career at that moment.  But what did Baldwin do?  He broke from the establishment.  He broke from his liberal friends.  He broke from his Jewish friends. ",

Remember he says at the end of Notes of a Native Son in the introduction, All I ever want to be is an honest man and who, like Hemingway, endures in my work.  Now, you see, in an age of mendacity and criminality, which is our own, just telling the truth and having integrity is revolutionary.  It's subversive.  It's countercultural.  But Baldwin comes back bringing this rich tradition of eloquence, truth-telling, witness-bearing, soul-stirring writing. ",

There are a great many things in the people I met, and I've been on the road for a year, but none of those things.  The truth, I think, is that their elders have betrayed them. ",

Be a force for good, Coltrane said.  Mississippi, God damn, says Nina Simone.  That ain't having hope.  That's being a hope.
