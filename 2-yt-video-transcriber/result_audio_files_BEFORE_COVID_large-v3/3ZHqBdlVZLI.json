Freedom Fighters, it's freedom news now.  on the front lines in Battle Creek, Michigan at the Calhoun County Justice Center for a First Amendment audit.  So we're going to go around to the side where I believe the sheriff's department and the jail is.  Got your handicap, right?  Notice by order of the sheriff and judicial circuit and district court.  Photography.  They're putting photography, electronic devices, communications equipment, cell phones in there with weapons and knives.  That's how much this place fears transparency and accountability.  There goes the Battle Creek cop.  So let's go around the side here guys by where the jail is and the sheriff's department.  look at all the trash.  it's full of trash.  okay you guys remember this spot.  Remember when we had our encounter with Tweedledee and Tweedledum, many of you like to call them.  Over here is visitor parking for the jail, Calhoun County Jail.  So back here, I have their Sally port.  This is not, not what I want.  That's why you will need something here.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  We've got the inmate visitors entrance.  Calhoun County Sheriff's Office, Sheriff Matthew M. Saxton.  No soliciting No smoking within 25 feet Doesn't say anything about no photography.  Keep on walking.  There's nothing for you to see over here.  Just people exercising their First Amendment rights, that's all.  This is a massive facility.  I don't know how many hundreds of people they incarcerating here but it's a big moneymaker as you can see.  I'm sure they have hundreds of beds and they keep them full.  you better believe that.  okay?  so it looks like we're getting fouled around here.  oh look at there guys.  oh i thought that was.  that's a sergeant.  Your officers are dismissed.  You can leave now.  They wanted to do something.  They wanted to exert their power.  They tried.  They asked their sergeant, their superiors.
