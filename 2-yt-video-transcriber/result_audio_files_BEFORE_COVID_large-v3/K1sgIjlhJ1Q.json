I agree with that, okay?  We stan Lady Gaga in this house.  But there's something in this sentiment that I want to talk about.  Something I want to explore and clarify.  There are actually three sentiments I want to talk about today, all of which concern themselves with artistic success.  We're starting with Lady Gaga because her sentiment here is the most mild, the least problematic, and the best intentioned of the bunch.  Before we go ahead and give her sentiment a label, I want to go ahead and show you an alternative to the follow your dream speech. ",

You gotta take a look at all the people who haven't succeeded if you want the full picture.

When I look back at my progress over the last 10 years, even though I didn't quite achieve the goals that I'd set for myself 10 years ago, I still love the progress I've made.  I made an independent feature film that I'm super proud of.  This YouTube channel has such crossed 50,000 subscribers by the end of the year.  And I finally upgraded my camera to something that'll let me shoot professional quality projects for the very first time.  The possibilities are endless.

            "text": "I know that sounds really depressing and fatalistic, but all I mean to say is that I know I'm not guaranteed filmmaking success.  Hell, even the people who've already achieved filmmaking success aren't guaranteed filmmaking success.  Then again, that's a big part of why every milestone feels like such a blessing and a privilege, because none of my progress is guaranteed.  I feel like there's a lot of people out there like me who wanna follow their dreams, who subsequently get a lot of advice on how to make it in this industry.  And in the interest of overcoming any survivorship bias in our sampling, I thought I'd offer my own thoughts on the subject.  Not because I'm particularly qualified, but because I'm not particularly not qualified.  Don't forget to like and subscribe!  Okay, back to Lady Gaga and Bo Burnham.  They're saying opposite things, and yet they're both somehow correct.  What's an aspiring artist to do?  Well, my honest to goddess opinion is that aspiring artists should pick two dreams to follow.  That's my advice, pick two dreams.  And you don't have to think of it as settling either.  Right now my first dream is to become a professional filmmaker.  That's kind of the Hail Mary dream.  The one that'll take a lot of luck and faith from external outsiders and a bunch of other stuff that I can't control.  The other dream is to create my all-time favorite YouTube channel and then figure out how to live off the proceeds that it might generate.  This dream is at least a little bit more self-directed than the other one.  Like I didn't have to find an agent or a manager before I started a YouTube channel.  And the best part is that both dreams are so fun that I've been able to pursue them both long before either of them looked like they could pan out.  So, if anyone's asking me whether or not they should follow their dreams, I'd say yes.  In fact, you should probably follow several.  But wait, this doesn't sound very ranty.  Wasn't I gonna rant about something?  Yes.  There's a second sentiment about artistic success that I'm seeing popping up more and more on film Twitter, which nags me quite a bit more than survivorship bias.  The sentiment basically boils down to this.  Anyone with an iPhone and an idea... can make a movie.  Which is technically true.  I mean sure, we have indeed reached the point where real live Hollywood films are literally being shot on iPhones.  And don't get me wrong, this sort of can-do spirit can certainly be helpful.  I've said similar things on my own blog.  The question isn't who's going to let you, the question is who's going to stop you.  But that's the sort of sentiment that gets you through production, not pre-production.  Big difference.  The unspoken insinuation here is that anyone whining about not being able to make movies has nobody but themselves to blame.  And while I'm sure that the people tweeting these things have nothing but the best intentions at heart, I'm not citing any specific examples here because I don't want people to think of this as a call-out, I do want to go on record here and point out that filmmaking is the most collaborative, expensive, and therefore exclusive art form ever devised.  Take our example from before, Unsane.  Shot on an iPhone, yay!  Movie making for the masses.  Well, hold on.  It was shot on an iPhone 7 Plus in 2017.  Care to guess how much an iPhone 7 Plus with 128 gigs of memory cost in 2017?  Yeah.  I bought my iPhone 6 for about $200, nearly two years after it came out, after taking advantage of a lucky trade-in deal and a well-timed tax refund.  I shot second service on a used Canon T3i that I bought off of Craigslist for about $400.  An $870 camera would have been out of my price range until just three months ago, when I finally upgraded my eight-year-old Canon for a brand new Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K.  Hashtag not an ad.  Hashtag not sponsored.  Hashtag would love to be.  After putting together a conservative prospectus and then forwarding it to potential investors so that I... No, just kidding.  I cashed out my 401k.  And hey.  Lucky me, most people my age don't have a 401k, much less enough money in it to buy a fancy new camera.  But that's my point.  These things aren't within the financial reach of most Americans.  And it's not like the camera is the only expense.  You've also got your actors, your crew, costuming, makeup, props, insurance, craft services, and over a dozen locations to secure.  Long story short, the total budget for this film, even though it was shot on an iPhone, was... ",

            "text": "We're gonna need some more 401ks.  Now, to be clear, I've never heard director Steven Soderbergh say the thing about anyone with an iPhone and an idea can make a movie.  I've got nothing but kudos for the cast and crew for what they were able to accomplish with the money that they had available here.  Unsane is a solid little thriller.  I just don't want anyone to point to this film as proof that all you need to make a movie is an iPhone and an idea.  Here's what I'd say instead.  All you need to practice making a film is an iPhone and an idea.  I made a dozen shorts between 2006 and 2016, which was the decade between my first acquiring a camera and my directing my first film.  But it's not like.  I became a filmmaker the second I shot a video of my ferrets taking a bath.  Or even a ten-minute short I made in high school about an ill-fated meeting between Grendel and Frankenstein's monster.  Or even in college, when I made four different documentaries about various aspects of student life.  That was all practice.  Invaluable practice, sure, but nothing that could have made it into a theater.  Hell, most of it isn't even worthy of YouTube.  Are you recording?  Oh yeah, I've been recording.  So what, I hear you say.  We all know it takes more than an iPhone and an idea to make a Hollywood film, but nothing's stopping anybody with an iPhone and an idea from making a film that they can be proud of, even if it doesn't get a big Hollywood release.  Sure, I get that.  I did it myself.  But it took a long time just to get to that point.  It took a long time to come up with an idea that I could shoot with just the people and the locations that I had available to me.  And it was still one of the hardest, most stressful, labor-intensive tasks I've ever accomplished, college included.  Here's the thing, I can't speak for all filmmakers, but for me, I don't get to choose which ideas I'm gonna come up with next.  I can't sit down and say to myself, okay, I've got access to this location, this actor, and this prop.  Now, what sort of story can I tell with these things?  That's not how it works.  My brain gives me ideas without any regard to budgeting.  Right now I've got scripts and outlines for big budget sci-fis, mid-range period pieces, and just a handful of relatively cheap dramas that would still cost tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of intense coordination to produce.  So yeah, I've got an iPhone and lots of ideas.  But unless I'm willing to dedicate the next several years of my life to producing near-suited versions of them all, I can't actually make any of them yet.  And it's got nothing to do with talent, nothing to do with hard work, nothing to do with how much I want to get this bread.  Which leads me to the third and final sentiment that I want to talk about.  The one that makes me truly angry.  Rise and grind film culture.  which I'm defining here as the glorification, romantization, or even downright fetishization of the socioeconomic, geographic, and political struggles that come with any attempt at artistic success.  You know, the kinds of struggles that disproportionately affect marginalized groups?  See, contained within rise-and-grind film culture are two nefarious implications.  The first is that you've got to suffer if you want to succeed. ",

            "text": "The second nefarious implication is that that suffering is actually good for you and your craft because it demonstrates how committed you are or because it'll make you appreciate success more, or some other load of crap like that.  Please don't misunderstand me.  Independent filmmaking takes a lot of hard work, and hard work you can be proud of.  I know I am.  Jesus, how many times am I gonna plug my movie before the end of this video?  But there's a big difference between being proud of your hard work and telling other people that they need to suffer like you did if they're going to succeed.  We're talking about actual misery here.  People risk their lives, their livelihoods, decades of their time, savings, careers, relationships with loved ones to try and break into this industry.  A calling like this can be a bona fide burden if you're not predisposed for success in this particular field.  And it's not like hard work alone is all it takes.  To use expressions like rise and grind to imply that filmmaking success comes down to a transactional, one-to-one exchange of effort for achievement, as opposed to a nebulous combination of talent, hard work, socioeconomic privilege, nepotistic industry connections, conventional attractiveness, the favorable alignment of arbitrary industry trends, and 13 literal metric boatloads of free time, which very few people have available in an economy that demands more of your time than most of us could ever hope to earn back, is blithely callous at best, and mildly nefarious at worst.  Again, it's not acknowledging the grind that bothers me so much.  It's the celebrating.  So where does that leave us?  Well, I guess I have two things left to say.  The first is that I don't think anybody should have to suffer for their art.  Or let me put it this way, you're gonna suffer no matter what, whether you're an artist or not.  Life's just sort of like that.  So as far as I'm concerned, there's never any need to cultivate suffering.  It's gonna happen and you can use it, but that doesn't mean it's an inherently good thing.  You can be proud of what you've overcome.  Just don't romanticize pain.  Don't assume that grinding yourself down is the secret ingredient to artistic success, because plenty of people grind themselves down and never achieve it.  If you're gonna throw everything you have into an artistic endeavor, do it because you enjoy the process.  Take breaks as often as you need them, in whatever form you need them, if that's what it takes for you to be sane and happy.  Because, ultimately, that's why we're all trying to break into this business, right?  Because it's so damn fun.  The second thing I want to say is... Well... Speaking of hard work, I guess this is as good a time as any to announce my next short film. ",
