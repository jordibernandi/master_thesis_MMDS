            "text": "So Representative Ilhan Omar is once again being heckled by someone in Congress.  Just recently, she ended up having to go at it on Twitter with someone over the same nonsensical claim that somehow, someway, because Ilhan Omar has the courage and quite frankly, the decency and the integrity to question AIPAC's involvement in the politics of the United States, then she must absolutely Be anti-Semitic.  That's what, that's what's also been asserted by not only the democratic party, excuse me, the Republican party, but the democratic party as well.  Um, and they've been ganging up on her.  This isn't like.  recent.  This is going on for about a month now.  And the fact that it's been allowed to go on so long by the Democratic Party, in my opinion, is emblematic of the loyalty, the dual loyalty that both the Democratic and Republican establishments have to their donors more so than even to the ethos of each individual party in defending its members against attacks from the other party.  That's scary because once again, it just reminds us that bipartisan efforts only seem to come into play when it's time to screw over the people or lie to the people.  Oftentimes, both are at play whenever bipartisanship is practiced.  So I want to go over a couple of these or a few of these tweets from Ilhan Omar.  I'm going to go straight through and then we're going to go back and reanalyze a few of them.  So the tweet that was originally posted.  was done by Nita Lowry, who was the Congresswoman.  She said, lawmakers must be able to debate without prejudice or bigotry.  Ironic, right?  I am saddened that Representative Omar continues to mischaracterize support for Israel, which she does not.  I urge her to retract this statement and engage in further dialogue with the Jewish community on why these comments are so hurtful.  So Ilhan Omar, responds, just as she always does, with the type of fierceness, the type of ferocity that would make you proud to call her your congresswoman, which I really sincerely wish.  she was our congresswoman here in Florida.  And I wish she had more of a microphone.  And I think she deserves one as well, because she just seems to be very unapologetic in her conviction that she refuses to to withdraw from these rhetorical engagements against people who are not really our friends.  They pretend to be, they're not even friends to Jewish people.  They pretend to be friends to the Jewish people because that's almost a requirement.  if you're going to try and pretend like you're worried about the safety of the Israeli government.  So Ilhan Omar goes on to say, Our democracy is built on debate, Congresswoman.  I should not be expected to have allegiance or pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on a committee.  The people of the Fifth elected me to serve their interests.  I am sure that we agree on that.  She goes on to say, I will not... I have not mischaracterized our relationship with Israel.  I have questioned it and that has been clear from my end.  I am told every day that I am anti-American if I am not pro-Israel.  I find that to be problematic and I am not alone.  I just happen to be willing to speak up on it and open myself to attacks.  My Americanness is questioned by the president and the GOP on a daily basis and yet my colleagues remain silent.  So we just referred to.  I know what it means to be American and no one will ever tell me otherwise.  I am the horn.  I am in the Horn of Africa this weekend, proud to see peace prosper here and to be part of the first American delegation to Eritrea.  In decades is one I'm grateful for.  I fight peace and justice because only those who experience the pain of war know the joys of peace.  Being opposed to Netanyahu in the occupation is not the same as being antisemitic.  I am grateful to the many Jewish allies who have spoken out and said the same.  We must be willing to combat hate of all kinds while also calling out oppression of all kinds.  I will do my best to live up to that.  I hope my colleagues will join me in doing the same.  I mean, that was beautifully put by Ilhan Omar.  And she's being very truthful when she says that the attacks coming against her are indeed disingenuous because if they're pretending as if the Jewish community is somehow hurt, by calling out the Israeli government for crimes against humanity.  That's just like a overgeneralization.  If we get into any more specifics, I might get riled up.  Y'all know how I feel about Netanyahu.  But saying that Jewish people would be hurt by calling out Israel for crimes against humanity would be the same as asserting that somehow Americans are hurt by the rest of the world calling out the imperialism of the United States because we do know that Israel does have an apartheid, an active apartheid.  Right now, against the Palestinians, the United States has helped contribute to various apartheids across the world.  And I don't take any insult by anyone telling me, hey, man, your government is out of control.  In fact, because I know what that means for the people of this country and, of course, for those abroad, but it hurts the people of this country.  Waging war after war, spending dollar after dollar, claiming that Medicare for all and public college is unaffordable while simultaneously saying, but we always have money for war.  That's problematic.  And bringing that to the attention of the international community does not hurt anybody.  It helps them.  And so I'm glad that Ilhan has continued to speak out against this and that she refused to back down.  She could refuse to back down, you know, behind closed doors.  That's possible.  But her being willing to put herself front and center with this issue is something that should be commended because it isn't easy.  Because you and I, you know, not being Muslim, not being Somali, not being an immigrant, at least not being a first generation immigrant, We would face attacks of anti-Semitism for calling out Israel and its, you know, faulty government.  The people who have jumped on to this bandwagon of insulting anyone who says that Netanyahu absolutely deserved to be brought up on charges of corruption.  The people being attacked are piling on and saying, oh, if you say that, then you're anti-Semitic.  You're wrong.  In fact... All the things that have been coming out about Netanyahu kind of proves everything we've been saying, that he's self-serving, that it's never been about the Jewish community, that his hatred towards Palestinians and Palestine in general is more of a selfish desire that's often driven by imperialistic people and imperialistic desires.  So it's kind of expected.  And the fact that people don't see that, it worries me.  But Ilhan, willing to put herself out on the line, says, no, I see the truth.  as a Muslim woman, given the history of Israel and the Muslim people, that says a lot about her character as a person.  And it says a lot about what we can expect out of her going forward as a Congresswoman, more importantly.  Now, I just want to address one of her tweets.  that kind of gets overlooked, I think.  I talk about it.  Not a lot of people do, but I don't have a problem bringing it up here.  Where she says, my Americanness is questioned by the president and the GOP on a daily basis, and yet my colleagues remain silent.  And I know what it means to be an American, and no one else will tell me otherwise.  When she says my American-ness is being questioned by the GOP on a daily basis, basically she's referring to the racist dog whistles that people use.  Actually, funny enough, the GOP wasn't the only ones who engaged in this behavior.  Chelsea Clinton said the same thing.  You all remember the sign, an American comment that she made whenever Ilhan was accused of being anti-Semitic.  What is being done is not coincidence.  She's saying my American is being questioned because she doesn't want to use the term racism because unfortunately the term racism has been co-opted by the right.  They say everything is racist.  If you call them off racism, then you're racist.  I know it's kind of irritating.  They've done that a lot.  But what she's referring to is the norm.  What you do is you question the American-ness of someone.  You question the race of someone.  You question the culture.  You question their ethnicity.  Now, what is that?  That's called a dog whistle, and it's used in the Southern strategy.  Now, the GOP participates in it, and because the Democrats are scared to lose there, they allow it to happen.  But also because, of course, the Democrats are bought off by Israel in their lobby as much as the Republicans are.  So there's that aspect too, of course.  But this Southern strategy, which was implemented and used by, I know it was used a lot by Barry Goldwater, the guy who ran on segregation, Richard Nixon, who was racist as hell.  It was used essentially to kind of cause a fissure in the already apparent racial divides And cultural divide that is evident in the deep south, in southern states, in red states.  So this is an old strategy, but it's still being used.  In fact, I would even venture to say, obviously, I can't confirm this, that Trump was very aware of the southern strategy because people forget Richard Nixon kind of ran on being a renegade.  Right.  Very similar to Donald Trump.  A lot of the things, Teddy Roosevelt, same thing, but Teddy Roosevelt didn't use a Southern strategy like Donald Trump did.  Donald Trump kind of used a Southern strategy.  He said a bunch of racist stuff a lot of the times without having to actually say the specific insult.  You know, like people think that if you don't call someone the N-word, then you're not racist and what you've said isn't racist.  But you know, like the Bishop peers of the world, if you will.  That's not the case.  The Southern strategy is just that.  And Republicans oftentimes like to pretend, the right in general really, like to pretend that the Southern strategy was never a thing because, well, I know the establishment still uses it today.  And so, of course, they have to pretend it isn't a thing because then you'd have to admit that there are people running purposely racist campaigns.  And that's actually the case.  So what Ilhan Omar is speaking to is basically them trying to question her American-ness because, well, who are the ones who mainly support Israel?  That group is still in the Republican Party.  Think about that.  So what do you do then?  It's a logical fallacy, of course, but you say it's American to do all these things that the Republicans advocate for.  And included in those things is supporting Israel without question.  Blind faith.  That's the Old Testament stuff.  That's why the Republicans love the Old Testament.  It says things like blind faith, but the New Testament says things like Jesus was not having that blind faith nonsense.  Jesus is all about, you don't believe me?  You know what?  That's fair.  You're logical human beings.  I'm just going to have to prove it.  And that's the difference, right?  But the... The South and the right-wing hyper-Christians are obsessed with the Old Testament because of things like blind faith and blind faith in authority.  So they say that liking Israel is included in all these things that make you American.  That blind faith.  But then they'll say, hold on.  You're wearing a scarf.  That's not American.  You're Black.  We all know how the Black people, you know, how they're treated.  They've been traditionally treated and looked at in the South.  Oh, and you don't like Israel.  Well, these two things are also un-American and you don't like Israel, which makes you super non-American.  So I can say, look at these other things that make her non-American.  You can't take her.  Her critiques of Israel are being made because she doesn't like America.  And because she's a Muslim, because she's a Javi, because she's Somali.  That's what they do.  They're called dog whistles.  Yes, making those links are logically fallacious, but that doesn't matter.  That's the point.  It's wrong.  So thank you, Ilhan, for continuously calling them out on their BS.  Somebody has to.  Somebody has to be that firecracker in Congress that we need to tell the truth while simultaneously getting the job done.  And you've proven time and time again that you have that audacity needed to be, by every sense of the word, a minority in Congress, but not being worried about anything else other than preserving the truth, and working for the people that you represent.  Thank you for that. ",
