            "text": "Hola, I'm Mike Pence.  On behalf of the American people, we say to all the good people of Venezuela, Right now, the Trump administration is openly engaging in a blatant effort to overthrow the government of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.  It's a campaign aimed at regime change, and it's being publicly promoted as an opportunity to steal Venezuelan oil for the benefit of U.S.  corporations.  They're not even pretending.  Here's National Security Advisor John Bolton speaking on Fox News.  Venezuela is one of the three countries I call the troika of tyranny.  It'll make a big difference to the United States economically if we could have American oil companies really invest in and produce the oil capabilities in Venezuela.  But this is not some insane Twitter thought spewed by Trump after guzzling down gallons of Fox & Friends.  It's open imperialism.  And it's not just being embraced by powerful Republicans, but Democrats as well.  Amid protests against Maduro, the head of the opposition party, Juan Guaido, declared himself president of Venezuela during a protest in late January, and he was immediately recognized by the United States.  Now, Maduro rejected Guaido's claim, accused the U.S.  of plotting a coup against him, and immediately ordered U.S.  diplomats to leave Venezuela.  Maduro later walked that back, but he does maintain the position that the U.S.  should stay out of Venezuela.  This push for regime change in Venezuela did not appear in a vacuum.  The CIA has been plotting with so-called rebels in Venezuela from the early days of the Trump administration.  Trump administration discussed a coup with rebel Venezuelan officers.  American officials are telling The Times that the administration indeed held secret meetings with rebellious military officers to discuss plans to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro.  Now with the media focus on the shutdown, on Trump Russia, on Trump's atrocious wall plan, Venezuela regime change appears to have been put on the fast track.  formally assume the competences of the national executive as the president in charge of Venezuela.  All across the so-called liberal media, the reporting and analysis on Venezuela these past weeks has been atrocious.  Actually, it's been terrible for a very long time.  And we should remember that The New York Times actually openly supported the 2002 coup against Hugo Chavez and his Bolivarian revolution.  But in the wake of the recent Venezuelan elections, there's been a uniformity to the characterization of Venezuela's suffering and chaos as the sole fault of Nicolas Maduro.  Almost never mentioned prominently is the fact that Venezuela has been systematically targeted by the United States and its allies and puppets in Latin America, or the impact that the sanctions have had, or the fact that there was an attempt to kill Maduro with a drone packed with explosives.  The story is just Maduro is a corrupt dictator and he needs to be taken out.  The central role that the U.S.  has played under Bush and Cheney, under Obama, and now under Trump in destabilizing Venezuela, it's an afterthought if it's even mentioned at all.  And it must be pointed out that this is not just the Trump administration pushing for regime change in Venezuela.  It's an afterthought.  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, a powerful Democrat from Illinois, released a statement praising Trump for, quote, appropriately recognizing Guaido.  House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said that Trump was right to recognize Guaido as president.  And then there was this insane propaganda video released by some Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee, including Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Elliot Engel, and former Clinton Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.  They declared, quote, we refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Maduro's presidency.  Maduro's administration held fraudulent elections and he has lost his mandate.  We cannot allow Nicolas Maduro to destroy his country, to continue to steamroll democracy and to act with impunity.  Now, if that's not cringeworthy enough, let's look at the man appointed to spearhead this bipartisan Venezuela regime change policy.  Today, I am incredibly excited to announce that a seasoned, principled, and tough-minded foreign policy veteran is joining our State Department team.  Elliott Abrams is coming aboard to lead our efforts on Venezuela.  Elliott Abrams is a notorious neoconservative, and he was actually a so-called never-Trumper who penned op-eds opposing Trump.  Well, clearly, a good old-fashioned coup d'etat mission was too juicy to pass up for Abrams.  I left this building 30 years ago this week, last time I worked here, so it's very nice to be back.  This crisis in Venezuela is deep and difficult and dangerous, and I can't wait to get to work on it.  Thank you.  Elliot Abrams is an unrepentant war criminal who played a central role in the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of people across Central and Latin America in the dirty wars of the 1980s.  He was a player in the Iran-Contra scandal.  But Abrams is an adult.  Abrams is an old Latin America hand.  It's sickening.  They brought in Elliott Abrams because of his immorality and his willingness to support mass murder.  It's the only reason that he's there.  And no one with even a flimsy grasp on morality should be welcoming his appointment as special envoy on Venezuela.  And let's remember that in 2002, during the Bush-Cheney administration, Abrams was a major proponent of the coup against Hugo Chavez.  Now, back in 1995, on an episode of The Charlie Rose Show on PBS, investigative journalist Alan Nairn debated Abrams.  Nairn had reported extensively from the killing fields of Central America, which Abrams played a key role in creating.  It was an incredible moment, as Nairn detailed Abrams' crimes and called for him to be put on trial.  Bush once talked about putting Saddam Hussein on trial for crimes against humanity, Nuremberg-style tribunal.  I think that's a good idea.  But if you're serious, you have to be even-handed.  If we look at a case like this, I think we have to start talking about putting Guatemalan and U.S.  officials on trial.  I think someone like Mr.  Abrams would be a fit subject for such a Nuremberg-style inquiry.  But I agree with Mr.  Abrams that Democrats would have to be in the dock with him.  As Donald Trump has cozied up to strongmen and dictators across the world, from Vladimir Putin to Mohammed bin Salman, Rodrigo Duterte, Kim Jong-un, Sisi of Egypt, it seems that he's found one so-called strongman that he can't tolerate.  And that leader happens to have the largest reserves of oil of any country in the world.  Well, we're looking at Venezuela.  It's a very sad situation.  That was the richest state in all of that area.  That's a big, beautiful area and by far the richest.  And now it's one of the poorest places in the world.  That's what socialism gets you.  We've heard this justification for intervention, for coups, for war from the United States and its leaders throughout history.  The U.S.  needs to go free the people from their undemocratic leaders.  It's all a huge rescue mission for the poor people who will be so happy when the United States comes in to liberate them.  It's all a big lie.  The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned oil company.  And the State Department says it's taking action to make sure that all of the money and other assets owned by Venezuela in the U.S.  and elsewhere around the world would be handed over to the control of the U.S.-backed Guaido.  Buried within a New York Times report on the sanctions was this tidbit.  The sanctions included exceptions to allow the American oil company Chevron, along with Dick Cheney's former company Halliburton, to continue working in Venezuela.  And that pretty much tells you everything you need to know about this situation.  Muchas gracias y vayan con Dios. ",
