            "text": "I'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message.  When I was growing up in Oklahoma, all three of my brothers went off to the military.  That was their ticket to the middle class.  Now me, my dream was to be a teacher.  I got a scholarship and went off to school, but dropped out and got married at 19.  My second chance was a commuter college that cost $50 a semester.  Today, there are fewer paths to America's middle class and even fewer second chances.  Service members are targeted by predatory lenders.  Students are crushed by debt.  Families can't afford childcare.  And after generations of discrimination, people of color face an even narrower path to opportunity.  When we have a government that works for the rich and the powerful and leaves everyone else behind, it's corruption pure and simple.  We must root it out and return our democracy to the people.  And yes, I got a plan for that. ",
