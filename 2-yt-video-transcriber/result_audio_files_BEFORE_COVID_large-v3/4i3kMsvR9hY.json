            "text": "You know, I posted a Facebook statement that has made the news in which the month of October leading up to what we call Halloween that the witches in the United States were joining together to place a binding curse.  This is what it would be called a binding curse on President Trump and anyone who's his followers.  Now, let me make something really clear.  In the Old Testament, Balak, a king from Moab, said to Balaam, I want you to stand on top of this mountain and place a curse on Israel.  Now, why would a king want Balaam to do that?  Because Israel had 600,000 men, not counting women and children.  If these men were married with one child, you're talking about somewhere about 1.8 million people.  Now, think about that population in a valley with their tents and and their animals.  And of course, I've been to the Middle East.  Grass is very limited.  There's limited places to get water.  So he feels like they are being invaded by another nation.  So he wants to play some kind of a hex or curse on them.  And Balaam tries three times.  And finally, Balaam says this.  I cannot curse what God has blessed.  Many of the people who support this present administration, many, not all, of course, are Christian people.  Many are evangelical spirit-filled people.  Now, the reason I'm saying that is to try to place a binding curse on people who have accepted the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive them of their sins, whose names are written in heaven, who understand the authority that is behind the name of Jesus, is impossible.  Because Paul said that Christ has spoiled principalities and powers and made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.  And I could do a word study right there on the word triumph and principalities and powers.  Basically, Revelation chapter 12, verse 11.  Let me just give you this verse.  They overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.  Now, religion, or just being God-conscious, is no protection against... evil words or evil things that try to come against a person.  However, when you are covered by the blood of Jesus with the confession of your faith, the blood of Jesus serves as your hedge and your protection.  So in my comment on Facebook, I mentioned that that individuals who were once involved in certain lifestyles of the occult have said to me that when we would try to place hexes or curses on Holy Ghost filled, powerful praying people, the curse would come back on us.  if we tried to make them sick the sickness would hit us.  one guy said up in knoxville.  he said you know we sent spirits out and the spirits came and started attacking us at night and we couldn't understand what was happening.  so what we need to do is say to god almighty through the power of the blood of jesus and the mighty name of christ We send every negative word which has been spoken over us or our leaders back to the person who spoke it, back to the person who's saying it, back to the person who speaks it.  And the other day, if you watched our world prayer, we went into rebuking this and the internet went crazy.  Really crazy stuff started happening because we're dealing with real spiritual warfare.  But aren't you glad, I know that I am, that when you understand the revelation of the covenant, that you have a covenant with God through Jesus Christ, that that covenant is a wonderful hedge of protection for your health, for your mind, for your body, for your soul, and your spirit.  So I want to encourage believers to fear not.  because if we fear God, God is the only one we are to fear.  Fear God because it's the beginning of wisdom and open your mouth in worship and praise to rebuke the enemy when he comes against you in any form and plead the blood of Jesus Christ.  Confess that, Revelation 12, 11, the verse I gave you just a moment ago.  So the point is that when God's blessing is on someone and they're in covenant with God, Scripture very strongly indicates that they have a favor of God, a protection of God that is not natural or normal, and God will take care of those who follow Him truly and walking with Him in faith and righteousness.  So I wanted to give you that word today because, you know, this will start making the news and it'll start spreading, and we want you to know there's still power in the name of Jesus, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of God, and there is still authority in and the power of the blood to forgive sin, cleanse sin, and even Isaiah 53 and second Peter said, healing that can come to your body.  So we agree with you today for God's best.  Also remember, there is only one official Perry Stone YouTube channel that you need to subscribe to and give us a thumbs up.  And anyone who tries to post me preaching, all of my preaching, even if it's in local churches, is under the copyright of Voice of Benjamin.  So you're going to be removed by YouTube.  And if we have to do it every day, we'll just do it every day because there's only one official channel and that's the one that you're watching right now, this video one.  So thank you for your prayers.  Thank you for all that you do for us as partners of our ministry.  God bless you. ",
