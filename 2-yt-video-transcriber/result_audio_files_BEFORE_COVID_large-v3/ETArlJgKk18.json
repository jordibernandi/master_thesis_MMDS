            "text": "Following on from my last video where I talked about people trying to externalize their subjective opinions onto everyone else and make the world responsible so they don't have to take responsibility for themselves.  It must be the universe trying to tell me something or get me angry because I had a conversation today which was pointing down that same perspective and then a few comments in the comment section below a few of my videos that pointed to exactly the same thing where where what I noticed was this just complete lack of fairness reciprocity and empathy or at least sympathy for another human being.  I was talking to a female in my day-to-day life today and And the comment popped up again.  What it amounted to from her lips was the platitude again that men should just man up.  It touched on this fake nebulous spirituality, this syntax and language that doesn't really mean anything.  It's not specific and is meant to just kind of be a forgive and forget kind of scenario where we should just move forward.  It's very political in nature.  where the phrases are almost designed to reboot your hard drive and just to let your guard down and say, okay, let's just calm down and let's just move forward.  Not paying attention to what led us there, what led to the exacerbation.  So I was talking to a female today about similar thing and then in the comment section today later under some of my videos one or two females were saying the same kind of thing where you know nature and men and women need to work together and feminism has duped women and societies to blame.  and again it's like what about you?  it's not feminism.  Whenever I try to mention, yes, feminism is a factor and the system is a factor and that's a factor, but whenever I try to pull it back to us, the individuals, how you and I act, how we operate, how we stand up for our ethics and morals in everyday life, That's considered sort of, it's considered blas\u00e9, unimportant.  Now, let's focus on these big things out there.  And I started to wonder, is it a female trait?  I know that women don't really feel guilt, but they do feel shame.  And, you know, if the society makes men evil... And so it's almost shameful to have any sympathy for them.  I wonder if that's a tactic to get women to be so blas\u00e9 and uncaring.  And I know women are very self-referential, but I just really got exacerbated today with... The female I was talking to in my life, as well as the females.  I was reading in the comment section under certain videos today, it all pointed to the same thing.  At the heart of us not getting along out there is.  I can fully sympathize, hell, empathize with the men that find it frustrating and just want to walk away.  When you're dealing with somebody who does not see you, it's almost like, you know, you're saying, look, I just got cut on my arm and they want to talk about the knife.  It's this lack of sympathy that just drives me nuts.  And it's coming from the same people that expected that same sympathy given to them in truckloads.  And I can't even get a grain of it in a conversation as an olive branch.  Can you at least acknowledge that?  that A, B, and C. And then they roll their eyes.  They think you're a conspiracy theorist, despite the overwhelming statistics and all these things.  And they love pointing to these large things outside themselves.  Everything other than personal sympathy and empathy and responsibility, these things close to us that we can actually have some sort of tactile and actually do something about.  no it's you know.  what about the starving children in Africa?  what about the immigrants?  love every fucking male on the planet except for the ones that are close to you except for your own.  understand them understand you know the plight of the whales.  understand fucking.  it's just.  it's infuriating.  it's so infuriating.  I just needed to get this off my chest.  They're like fucking goldfish sometimes.  You've explained things clearly from your point of view that they're almost annoyed at the airtight clarity from your position.  That is, their position is indefensible.  And then they come back tomorrow complaining about the same things.  the pay gap, mansplaining, patriarchy, it's really hard to have sympathy.  It's like dealing with an addict.  They'll complain that you forget an anniversary date, but they can't remember your biggest fears, pains, and concerns that overarch your entire life.  It's just amazing sometimes.  Your biggest existential fears are about being a man today, why you won't do large things in your life that directly affect these females, like the avoidance of marriage and why you're not concerned about something that women are concerned about or why you are heavily concerned about something that doesn't give women what they want, yet they don't care about your whys.  Look, I know it's asking much, if not impossible, for women to empathize with men because they're so in-group-preferenced and so referential in terms of their own individuality.  When you care about men coming in from another country that think you're one notch above dogs, that you care about the male children... of countries you can't speak the language of, you've never been to, you know nothing about, and you hate and just don't care about the men right next to you.  Look, I'm trying really hard to care about the things in my world, and as such, there are people connected to it, and I live in a world of people.  But fuck, come on.  If your mental stubbornness won't come all the way with me in conversation, at least come part of the way.  But this kind of reluctance and not wanting to sort of give anything... Not wanting to come partway with me in a conversation, yet expecting tenfold of that understanding and that sympathy and empathy towards you.  I just don't know why gynocentrism and women in general scratch their heads at what's wrong with men as though we should be ashamed.  This whole man up attitude, which is all of what I was seeing today and hearing.  the lack of sympathy of being able to understand even at least the arguments of our reticence of manning up.  Why should we?  And it's not a disparaging phrase.  What's in it for us?  Why are we not?  Why are we reluctant?  Why are men, young men these days, Identifying with MGTOW, men who are as horny as hell are smothering that natural urge because they're scared shitless of what women might do to them, of the attitudes women openly have of them, and the lack of caring and sympathy.  Isn't it rational not to care about somebody and something that cares even less for you?  It's not rocket science.  And like I say, I'm trying.  And there are men out there who have procreational urges that I don't, that are frustrated.  And I really feel for them because it's a lot easier for me.  I'm not amputating parts of myself existentially, you know, the meanings of my life as much as other men are because I just don't have those in me.  But I can see them and it just fucking annoys me.  that the other half of our species doesn't and doesn't seem to care one bit.  All they care is from their own self-referential point.  But what about me?  Why aren't you manning up?  Oh, God.  Anyway, as JTO would say, have a lovely day.  Talk to you later, guys. ",
