            "text": "Is your mind separate from your body?  Do you have a feeling of two-ness?  Or is your mind part of your body?  Or is your mind in control of your body?  This seems intuitive to most of us, but most appeals to modern science refute this.  the mind is made up of neurons synapses chemical compounds in other words matter.  so is the mind-body divide simply an illusion?  effect theory is in part an attempt to overcome this duality to synthesize the body and the mind.  the idea of effects has a history that goes back to spinoza's ethics published in sixteen seventy seven but the effective turn a more thorough engagement with what effects are came in the mid nineties from philosophers brian musumi and eve sedgwick.  A fact theory can, in part, be seen as a move away from the linguistic turn of the mid-twentieth century, central to which was the idea that language was the primary way we understand the world, and so an engagement with how language is constructed, used and changes should be fundamental to theories about human nature or social institutions.  effect theory might be seen as bringing biology the material world and the body back into the picture and uniting scientific and social theories.  to start we might think about how we suppose that the mind and body interact at its simplest.  the body sends signals to the mind through its senses its sensations.  To borrow a few terms from effect theorists, effects are like forces.  They are prior to intentions.  They are autonomic.  They are pre-subjective.  They are visceral.  They are the intensities that move us.  Effects are a way of theorising about the social forces that we encounter that might trigger the body to respond in a certain way.  For the philosopher Brian Masumi, effects precedes emotional states.  Effect is not a personal feeling, he writes.  Effect is a non-conscious experience of intensity.  They cannot be fully realised in language because effect is always prior to or outside of consciousness.  We are affected by things touching us, by seeing things, by smelling things, by hearing things.  They're like the inputs into the body.  In the introduction to one of the foundational texts on effect theory, Parables for the Virtual, Musumi writes that when I think of my body and ask what it does to earn that name, two things stand out.  It moves.  It feels.  The book looks at the ramifications of this simple observation, that the movement of the body produces changes in the world.  Our actions have an effect on other bodies.  The eardrum, for example, is affected by vibrations in the air.  A wall affects our body by stopping its progress.  Culturally, words and walls affect us, producing possibilities and limitations.  in turn we produce our own words and our own walls that affect other bodies and then potentially their minds.  the way we affect and are affected has to be culturally mediated so that we can make sense of the world.  we have to have shared expectations of where walls go and what words mean what morals and politeness and norms and politics are.  everything affects us in a certain way.  one consequence of thinking like this though is that it leaves the mind as a slave to outside forces.  we are interpolated subjects.  that means we are constructed produced defined in a certain way by forces outside of ourselves.  The question for many effect theorists is how do we bring change and potential back into the picture?  How, Masumi asks, does a body perform its way out of a definitional framework that is not only responsible for its very construction, but seems to pre-script every possible signifying and counter-signifying move as a selection from a repertoire of possible permutations on a limited set of predetermined terms?  the way out of this is to conceive of the real material world and abstract ideas or minds as the same thing what de leuze calls real but abstract.  think of them as part of each other.  Take the movement of the arm and the hand.  It's real, it's material, it's bodily, it's matter.  It is affected in certain ways, but in every movement and every moment it also has abstract possibilities.  It has a number of positions it can move to.  It might hit a wall and be limited.  It's also defined by cultural abstractions, wedding rings, gestures, how words are written.  material in the world is never just material it's always something more.  it always has potential in it.  all of these things are part of the potentiality of the hand.  it's real but abstract.  it's body and mind at the same time.  traditionally when we think abstractly we might come up with ideas.  national identity is liberalism is this plant is is implies stability something frozen in time.  but if we think of how the hand is both material and abstract then abstract ideas must also be material and must imply concrete movements and possibilities.  National identity can, liberalism can, and plants can.  We have to combine the abstract and the material.  Misumi argues that because abstraction and matter are the same and that matter is always in movement, we should start from process rather than coding.  ok this may all sound both unnecessarily esoteric and complicated and you might be thinking so what but the way you start theorising about things like national identity and liberalism has huge consequences for how we think about them and how the ideas proliferate into other disciplines into journalism into the news into schools how change itself occurs.  everything that affects us materially presupposes a range of possibilities and every possibility presupposes a range of effects.  masumi argues that instead of the duality of nature culture or mind body or nature nurture we need a continuum of each.  we don't need social construction we need social production.  So, fundamentally for Masumi, effect theory is a way to think about ideas and matter at the same time.  Every position of matter in space and time presumes a range of abstract possibilities, and the title of the book refers to Deleuze's concept of the virtual, which was the topic of this previous video.  and this might all make more sense if you watch that.  In her book Touching Feeling, Eve Sedgwick begins by almost reversing Musumi's starting point.  Sedgwick also thinks of effect theory as overcoming the dualistic divide between mind and body, but starts by looking at how we're affected by language.  Sedgwick begins with a discussion on performative utterances.  A concept by the philosopher of language J. L. Austin that argues that language doesn't just describe the world, but also creates the world.  Phrases like the chair is red are different to utterances like I promise, I name, or I give to you.  The latter actually do something.  The language itself has an effect on the world.  it creates something.  Philosopher Judith Butler famously applied performative utterances to gender, arguing that gender itself was performed, that it constructed and affected the world.  A woman does X, or a woman should behave in Z way, have the appearance of describing what a person thinks, or of describing some authentic reality that they believe in, but actually these utterances construct, produce and perform gender.  They are affective.  Language used in the news, in politics, in books, both the words themselves and the structural way that they are used create who we are, create our identities.  Utterances, affect, language, codes, norms, they all have the effect of constructing subjects in one way.  and automatically excluding and repressing others.  They produce rather than eliminate, they disguise themselves as natural, giving the appearance of being voluntary.  This doesn't mean that's all we are though.  If we apply Misumi's logic of the arm and hand being real but abstract, having possibilities in every moment, then language has a number of possibilities confined within each configuration.  we reconstruct reorganize and untap the potential within these utterances.  repeating something you read in a newspaper is a good example of this.  it's not saying you can't have another opinion.  it's just saying here's an opinion for you to repeat.  it affects you it moves your lips.  sedgwick wants to apply this logic to objects as well as language.  like the hand that is always more than what it is sedgwick invokes material.  texture that is also more than what it is.  textures have a context.  they invoke softness or safety hardness or danger.  textures also have a history.  fashion and clothing have a history.  jumpers invoke warmness fires comfort.  the way we experience materials in the world say more than what they appear to on the surface.  effect theory is still in its infancy and in many ways and especially for musumi and sedgwick thinking about effect is as much an exploration and experiment a literary pursuit as it's a definable theory.  but importantly it's about bringing movement into theory to moving away from simply thinking about language and social construction two major themes of humanity's departments for a few decades now.  it's important to think about fluidity motion material biology language and how our bodies and minds are both moved and move.
