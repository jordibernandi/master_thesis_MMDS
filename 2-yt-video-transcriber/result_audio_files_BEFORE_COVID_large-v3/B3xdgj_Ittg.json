The judge suspended my sentence and once again put me on house arrest, except for, of course, I had my house evicted from me last week, so that meant the prison had to buy me a new house to be arrested.  And it's much nicer than my old house, and I love it, and I'm happy, and I'm comfortable.  We've got a great one for you this week, as we call the right chicks very, very bad, plus the tailgater calls Patrick Netherton good, and we give a little bit of a shout-out to Tom Gully, who's not great and a little bit drunk.  First, though, we love calling Sebastian Gorka, because whenever we do, we get on the news, and that's what happened this week, and we also got a callback from somebody afterwards, and it was really one of our favorite moments in the history of any of this.

This week, it's your only place to catch JJ and Matt Connerton.  That's right.  We've got ourselves five full minutes of JJ action.  And the only way to watch it is become a patron.  Or if you're already a patron, you just go over and click the damn link and then watch it.  I'm just going to be chilling out in my new home and having a rest and having a sleep on this very nice and comfortable bed that was bought for me by the prison.  And it sucks to be them.  Anyways, this week's comment of the week goes to the comment.  that said, JJ puts on his chapstick before he kisses his shirts before bed every night.  Or something like that.  Anyways, it's up on the screen right now.  And so you don't even need me to say it.  And congratulations.  And this week's comment of the week topic is candy.  Candy.  Candy.  Bye.  But it's only an illusion. ",
