And at the same time, he pointedly called out his rivals, saying they want to ignore all the work he did as vice president.  Take a listen. ",

I've witnessed an incredible, incredible amount of change in this nation, and I've worked to make that change happen.  And yes, I've changed also.  I'm not the same person under the Senate at age 29.  I don't pretend to have gotten everything right.  I don't pretend that none of my positions have changed.  I've grown, and I think it's good to be able to grow.  to progress.  If you look at the issues I've been attacked on, nearly every one of them somehow has something to do with before 2008.  As if my opponents want to believe I served from 1972 to 2008 and then took a hiatus the next eight years.  They don't want to talk much about my time as Vice President of the United States. ",

It's a book that talks about universal spiritual themes of inner peace and forgiveness and love.  And those universal spiritual themes are in all the great religious and spiritual systems of the world.  And as a woman, understanding more deeply what love means in my life, how to forgive, how to be more giving, more about giving than taking, how to be of service, how to try to live my life as a woman in greater relationship, deeper relationship with the people around me, what it means to live in justice and in mercy and in love.  Whether I'm finding it from my own religious tradition of Judaism, whether I'm finding it from the Course in Miracles, whether I'm finding it from Hinduism, whether I'm finding it reading in Buddhism.  I studied comparative religion and philosophy when I was in college.  I started taking religion and spirituality classes when I was in high school.  And we live in a country where that kind of religious and spiritual seeking is common.  This is America.  We're a very religious nation.  So this is not weird.  And no matter how many times people want to act like it's weird that somebody believes in God, weird that somebody tries to live a more forgiving or loving life, I think our public policy could use a little dose of love, a dose of moral and ethical consideration.  Nobody should be apologizing for the fact we're trying to figure out and to to live in more practical ways and more loving existence. ",

So I saw a meme, the one you're talking about, I saw a meme with my face.  Listen.  I think all of the women who are running for president are lovely.  I have met them all.  I have great respect for them all.  And Vogue magazine did what Vogue magazine did.  I certainly don't have an issue with any of the women.
