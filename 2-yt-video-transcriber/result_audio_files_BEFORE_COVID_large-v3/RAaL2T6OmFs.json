But the fact that we struggle with mental health in a world where for so many of us the constant threat of poverty, war, racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia and ableism hangs over our heads is not our fault.  The fact that we feel alone in a society that is so overbearingly individualistic and centered around the self is not our fault.  The fact that you sometimes feel guilty in a society where your self-worth has been tied to your productivity, your finances, your work or your usefulness is not your fault.  The fact that so many other people on this planet are struggling with the same thing that I am is tangible proof that I am not alone.  So many people feel alone.  That alone means that you aren't.  I'd like to thank my patrons for believing in me.  If you would like to support me on Patreon, there'll be a link in the description.  And a special thanks to Kay, Jessica, LPQ Silver, Mountain Snow, Nancy T, Nellis, Reasonably Agitated Honeybee, and ThatOneGuyBrad.  Thank you all.  so, so much.  See you next time. ",
