            "text": "One of my friends got his His Johnson sucked Like literally in the car with the bride soon-to-be bride.  I thought that was pretty bad.  Hello everybody Terrence pop here I with another episode of Live from the Lair.  And today we're gonna be going over a couple of subjects that some people don't like and some people do like.  We're gonna be going over the bachelorette and bachelor party philosophies.  Now, in my younger days, when I was on active duty, I and several of my compatriots were involved in the exploits of several female bachelor parties.  Now, I'm going to be honest with you.  I have been to... Probably somewhere between 60 and 70 bachelor parties for men.  And I've only seen maybe, I was involved in six or eight female bachelor parties between the ages of 20 and 29.  And I'm just going to tell you straight up that the female bachelor parties were way fucking worse.  Way worse.  The bachelor parties that I was involved in, there were strippers.  Sometimes there were waves of strippers.  But, you know, other than like titties being put in somebody's mouth or you're getting your picture taken with titties on your head, which... I encouraged quite a few individuals to get and I am still hated and talked badly about by many a wife and ex-wife out there because of such things.  But that's another story.  This is all an evil fucker.  But these female bachelor parties, okay, I remember one, like, literally, I went up to the bar to get these girls some drinks, and it wasn't the actual bride, it was one of the girls in the party, like, was standing behind me, and I turned around holding this, like, there's like 11 shots on there, and she literally is grabbing my dick and trying to take it out of my pants.  Like, literally, I'm almost spilling drinks, like, hey, Hey, hey, hey, whoa, no, no, no.  And, you know, we were drinking and stuff.  You know, I didn't nail any of those chicks.  I got a couple phone numbers.  One of them who was, you know, not married or didn't have a boyfriend, I went out with her for like six weeks after the fact.  And then I went to the field.  I was in the field.  I went on deployment for like a month, came back, and fucking MIA, which is typical.  Not a big deal.  Okay.  Okay, but in all of these other exploits, my friends and associates have been involved in some crazy, crazy debacles.  For instance, one of my friends got his Johnson sucked.  Like literally in the car with the bride, soon to be bride.  I thought that was pretty bad.  We kind of kicked around, you know, tracking the groom down and telling him the shit.  But, you know, what are you going to do?  The internet didn't exist back then, so things were a lot harder. ",

            "text": "yeah I remember we got basically invited along with this bachelor party with these chicks and this was down at in Myrtle Beach.  that's in Myrtle Beach.  there was four of us and we're hanging out.  you know we're just kind of we're hanging out with these chicks doing the deal and drinking.  everything was going.  you know kind of it was you know way crazy.  there was all kinds of titties being shown and stuff like that and we go back to their hotel rooms because they had like three hotel rooms and they were all adjoining.  so they opened the door.  so it's like one big fucking thing.  it was.  i mean it was crazy.  the whole night was fucking crazy and and this is the part that just went off the fucking hook so they had some male strippers show up.  First of all, I'm not like the big male stripper kind of guy.  It was very uncomfortable.  And these dudes, they're ripped up really good, big buff guys stripping down to G-strings.  And half the women there were sucking these guys' dicks, taking turns.  These dudes were banging these chicks without protection.  Wow!  And I remember at the time, because we were in the Q course, and me and my buddies that were with me were just kind of like, We need to leave because this isn't going anywhere good.  We put down our drinks and we fucking left.  And I don't know what fucking happened after that, but I'm sure that it wasn't good.  So, you know, just from what I've seen, Hands down, the women bachelor parties are fucking way worse.  The debacle, the craziness that they do once they start drinking, and it's, oh my God.  You know, and it's the same thing with the girls' night out.  Now, if I had known back in the day what I know now... When I was dating some of the women in the past, as soon as I heard that I'm going to go out on a girl's night out, I would literally start making plans to fucking pack my shit and break contact.  Because, you know, in my opinion, unless all of her friends are meeting at one of her friends' house and they're fucking watching movies and shit... If they're going out on the town, they're dick shopping.  Just straight up dick shopping.  Especially if they go out with a coletage, which is French for tits on a platter.  They're dick hunting.  They are looking for the replacement dick for you.  So my honest to God advice to you gentlemen, if you are with a woman that goes out on these ladies nights out, you need to watch my pre-divorce mentality and get yourself ready to eject yourself from that situation because it's not going to go anywhere fucking good.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you know, I've just seen, oh man, I'm just remembering this one bachelor party where one of the women in this, there was like 15, 18 of these chicks, one of them literally fucked three of my friends, one of them fucked three of my friends, like one after the other, you know, in the span of like an hour and a half.  Just took them out in the parking lot, banged them in the car.  I was just like, whoa.  You know, I probably could have been up in the lineup, but you know what?  I'm not about all that.  So, you know, I just high-fived my buddies for doing it and basically told them that they should go see the medic in the morning and get a shot and some pills and a harsh talking to because this is some crazy-ass shit.  All right.  Now, here goes some of the mail batch to the parties.  Now... Alright, one of my friends, I'm not going to say his name, he's got basically half a liver.  As a young child in his middle teens, he was hit with Rye Syndrome, which wreaked havoc on his liver.  And he almost died.  As a byproduct to that, he is super sensitive to alcohol.  Now, I know they say, oh, your liver regenerates, you know, and by the time he got married, he was... I think he was 23 at the time.  He was the same age as me.  And I was off active duty.  And so I go with him on his bachelor party.  And we go to a strip club.  And I order him a shot of Uzo basically every 20 to 30 minutes.  And by the end of the second hour, he is just destroyed.  Like, destroyed.  passing out, can't walk, drunk.  Well, his half-brother, who's also a friend of mine, is worried about alcohol poisoning because he has this liver issue.  And I'm like, yeah, okay.  So... You know, we decide we're going to take him out of there.  And we roll him out.  And we can't really take him home yet because we kind of promised his soon-to-be wife that we weren't going to twist him up that bad.  So we were trying to sober him up.  But he had drank a lot, and we could not get him to vomit.  So I'm like, hey, you know what?  Why don't we just drag him to the other room and leave his head in the cat box?  and let nature take its course.  So I drag him there, and I put his head in the cat box, and I walk out, and I go to the kitchen, and I get a beer, and I'm watching TV, and his half-brother's there, and it went on for maybe five minutes, and finally he puts his beer down, and he's like, I can't fucking do it, Pop.  I can't fucking do it.  I've known him since he was like eight.  I can't leave his head in the cat box.  So we go in there.  Pull his head out of the cat box.  He's got kitty litter stuck to his face.  And he's fucked up bad.  So I'm like, you know what?  Why don't you make him drink some dishwater?  That might work.  So go to the sink, get some tepid fucking nasty dishwater, make him drink like three or four swallows.  Boom.  Instant vomit.  He's puking his fucking guts out.  You know, we let it go.  You know, he went on for like a half an hour.  You know, we hosed him off a little bit in between vomit sessions.  And then his brother, his half-brother's like, hey, you fucked him up.  You got to carry him.  And I'm like, okay.  I throw him over my shoulder.  You know, we walk down the stairs.  He's on the second, he's on like the third story of an apartment.  We walk down the stairs and go to his car and throw him in the fucking back seat.  And we drive him out to his, the bride's house because she's having her own bachelorette party.  All her friends are having a little thing at the house and And I remember, you know, I have him over my shoulder and I'm walking up the steps and I just get just the vicious, most vile looks from his mother, the bride's mother, the bride and her best friend.  They are just looks of utter hatred as I walk him up the stairs and throw him on the bed.  You know, boom, boom, he was out cold.  I thought that was pretty good.  And that was his first bachelor party.  And he got divorced after that and then got remarried.  And we had another little soiree for him.  And I got him pretty twisted up, but not as bad as the first time.  I thought that was pretty good.  What are you going to do?  You know, and I did that for a good dozen guys.  You know, I was the best man in, like, 11 or 12 weddings.  Three of them for my best friend.  And the rest of them for close soldiers to me.  that, you know, wanted me to be their best man.  So... And every time I took them out and just got them fucking wrecked.  Just... They just drank so much fucking alcohol.  We were teetering on the verge of alcohol poisoning.  But at no time was there any dick to pussy contact or any female's mouth on any part of the groom's body.  Yes, there were some Polaroids of tits on heads and stuff like that, but that's just bachelor party shit.  I have never, ever seen a male bachelor party where dudes are banging strippers or prostitutes or anything like that.  It's fucking pretty crazy.  Now, I've heard stories... that that shit goes on, but I have never seen it.  I mean, I've seen all kinds of strippers.  I've seen the crazy stripper shows.  At my bachelor party, there was the crazy stripper shows and all kinds of rubbing and tits on faces and stuff, but that's it.  At the end of my bachelor party, I had a combat medic there who gave me one liter IV in each arm and sent me on my way.  That was a good night.  That was a fucking great fucking time.  But I'm never getting married again.  I'm not doing that shit twice, so fuck that.  But yeah, yeah, I mean, in my opinion, bachelorette parties, especially if there's strippers involved or any of that crazy shit, way worse.  way worse than what happens at a man's bachelor party.  That's just my humble opinion from the 60 or 70 bachelor parties I've attended and the six to nine female bachelor parties that I was invited into in my younger years.  I've heard all kinds of crazy stories about other soldiers of mine whose wives went out and got knocked up from other dudes at a bachelorette party.  This one dude found out after he'd been married 18 months that at his wife's bachelorette party she sucked eight guys' dicks.  There was video of it.  What the fuck is that?  Doesn't anyone know that the fucking internet lasts forever?  I mean, come on.  I mean, you're just asking for it.  If you're going to do shit like that and film it.  What's wrong?  I mean, it'd be one thing if you didn't know what was going on and they tricked you.  She was like smiling for the camera and stuff.  So I heard.  I didn't actually see it.  Nor did I want to because I knew this particular soldier quite well.  And he was really, really broken up over the whole damn thing.  And a lot of these women, they didn't have any fucking remorse, man.  No fucking remorse for the crazy shit that went on at this shit.  So, again, I'm going to reiterate.  If you're planning on getting married and your old lady insists on having a bachelorette party, you might want to pack your shit, throw it in your fucking car, and leave.  Because that shit ain't going anywhere good, gentlemen.  Now, is there a double standard?  Yes, there is.  And for whatever reason... When men have a bachelor party, for the most part, of all the bachelor parties I have ever seen, everyone was relatively well-behaved.  I didn't see any women pulling tricks.  There was pussy, there was titties, there was some rubbing on the guys.  And maybe some lap dances, but that's about it.  That's about it.  But what the fuck do I know?  I haven't been around the block a few times and seen anything.  Anyway, gentlemen, that's my take on the bachelorette bachelor party thing that people like to fucking do.  You guys have a good night, and I'll talk to you later. ",
