            "text": "TV, it's your brother Priest Daniala, and I'm sitting here with a very, very distinguished guest.  So, sister, introduce yourself to the family.  Who are you?  What's your name?  My name is Bonnie Williams.  I'm the wife of Stanley Tookie Williams.  Oh, you're the wife of Stanley Tookie Williams.  Yes.  Absolutely.  So, a lot of the young people, they know who that is.  Your husband was a very, very famous person all over the world.  World known, world respected.  Even me in New York, I know who he is.  And I see that you are dressed in Israelite garb.  So... How did you find out about the truth?  My son, which is Tookie and I's son, Kazab.  Kazab.  I'm sorry.  He's been in the truth for over 20 years.  So I'm kind of new to it, but it's Gucci.  I love it.  I love it.  So as what I can say, as for me and my house, we will serve the most high.  And I'm still kind of new in it.  I'm learning so much.  I'm getting so much knowledge.  I love it.  And all I can tell anyone is that coming to this truth, because as the kids say, it suits you.  You know, you don't have to be holier than thou, but we follow the law, statutes, and commandments.  And you're treated nice and respectfully by all your brothers?  Oh, yes.  To the utmost.  I love it.  I love it.  Y'all spoiling me.  That's all right.  That's what we do.  That's what we do, man.  Well, I appreciate the interview.  Do you have any words that you want to tell the family at home?  Anything you want to say about your late husband or anything that you want to say to the family before we go?  Just keep us up in prayer.  Keep us lifted in prayer because it's still a daily struggle, you know, and coming to this truth.  I want everybody to come to the truth.  I want my people to know.  I want my people to know what it really is.  All praise to the Most High.  Well, I appreciate your time and hope you enjoy the rest of your day at the cookout.  Thank you for the interview.  Thank you.  All right, take care. ",
