In fact, in the Kazon experience, we'll say again and again that everyone ends up somewhere, but few people end up somewhere on purpose.  Everyone ends up somewhere, but few people have a plan, have a vision, but few people have a plan, have a vision, and end up in a very specific place because God led them to that place. ",

And I believe as you seek God prayerfully that you're not just going to end up somewhere, but you're going to end up somewhere on purpose.  So, the Kazon experience will help you do two things.  The first thing is you're going to prayerfully discover God's purpose for you.  for your life, and number two, you're going to develop a realistic plan to start working toward living out that purpose.  Because everyone ends up somewhere, but few people end up somewhere on purpose.  And I believe with all my heart that living with a purpose is the difference between just existing and thriving in the way that you live.  Wow, I never thought of it that way.  That's really something.  So, you may say, what is kazon?  Well, kazon comes from Proverbs 29, 18.  And you attribute all this to the calzone?  Yeah.  And the Bible says, where there is no vision, the people perish. ",

Where there is no prophetic vision, the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law.  Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained, but happy is he who keeps the law.  Where people do not accept divine guidance, they run wild, but whoever obeys the law is joyful.  This Bible verse is really about listening to God's word and obeying God's word.
