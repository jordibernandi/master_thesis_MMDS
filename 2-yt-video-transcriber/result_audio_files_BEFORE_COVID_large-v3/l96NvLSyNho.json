So Board of Sheriff, you know about it.  Hello, John.  Hi, Steve.  So thank you very much.  I'm heading out to El Paso, Texas right now.  And we are going to do a job.  We're going to continue to do what we're doing.  I think we've made a lot of progress.  We've actually started a big, big portion of wall today in a very important location.  And it's going to go up pretty quickly over the next nine months.  That whole area will be finished.  It's fully funded.  construction, which I know a lot about.  It's begun, and it's a much better wall, much stronger wall, and a much less expensive wall than we've been building.  And we're going to have a lot of wall being built in the next period of time.  I'm with some of the great law enforcement people.  A lot of them are friends of mine.  I've known them for a long time, and they've been fantastic people, fantastic men and women.  And they know what we're up against.  We're up against people that want to allow criminals into our society.  And you explain that one.  You know, most things you understand, but they want to allow criminals into our society.  Convicted felons, people of tremendous, like, big problems.  I just got this from Homeland Security.

Larceny, 20,000 people.  Fraudulent activities, 12,000 people.  Burglaries, 12,000 people.  These again are just a different crime.  Robberies, these are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we don't want in our country.  And the Democrats want them to go into our country.  That's why they don't want to give us what we call the beds.  It's much more complicated than beds.  But we call them the beds.  Robberies, 5,991.  Sexual assaults, 6,350.  Forgeries, 5,158.  Stolen property, 4,462.  These are people we're talking about.  Kidnapping.  These are people that kidnap people.  The Democrats want them to come into our society.  I don't think so.  Anybody here would like to have a lot of kidnappers left in our society?  I won't bother waiting for you to raise your hand, right?  Kidnappings, 2,085.  Homicides, that means murder.  Murderers, 2,028.  I mean, it's incredible.  Sexual offenses, 1,739.  Just came out two minutes ago.  Homeland Security, Department of Homeland Security.  I don't know.  Maybe we're in a different country than I know of.  And we're going to El Paso.  We have a line that is very long already.  I mean, you see what's going on.  And I understand our competitors got a line, too, but it's a tiny little line.  Of course, they'll make it sound like they had more people than we do.  That's not going to happen.  But we're going there for a reason.  We're going there to keep our country safe.  And we don't want murderers and drug dealers and gang members, MS-13 and some of the worst people in the world coming into our country. ",
