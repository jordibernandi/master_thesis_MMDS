And, you know, the bottom line is, is like, this is out and out incredible exploitation.  And it's very hard to look at these teams and say, Hey, this is, there's a, there's a sort of tinge of racial exploitation here too, maybe.  We're going to go to areas where maybe there's a decent amount of poverty.  And this is their one ticket out.  This is their one ticket out.  And so the idea that, yeah, of course.  Student athletes should be paid and they should be unionized just like professional athletes because they're professional in every way except for the fact they don't get paid.  They are creating value.  Without a doubt.  Extraordinary value.  And they pay them and then they can pay their tuition.  How's that?

When you look at the history of HBCUs and you look at the hundreds of thousands of black professionals that have come from these schools over the course of the last several years since they've been created, and you look at what's been lost since integration has happened, what she was saying was simply that athletics is a multibillion-dollar business.  I went to two historically white universities, Duke University and University of Georgia, that have a lot of money based on athletics.  What she was saying that, look, we're living in a time where there's a big racial wealth gap.  The average white family has a net income, a net worth that's 10 times that of a black family.  And so if we're able to have some of these athletes that create so much income go to some of these schools, not that white students don't go and students of other ethnicities don't go.  We live in a time where everybody can go wherever they want to.  But what she was saying simply, we're trying to pump money and revenue into some of these communities that there's still this big disparity, this may be a way to do it.  Obviously, that's in a vacuum.  There are other factors to figure into that.  But when you read her argument, look, she lays it out very, very cleanly.  And it's actually something that I agree with.
