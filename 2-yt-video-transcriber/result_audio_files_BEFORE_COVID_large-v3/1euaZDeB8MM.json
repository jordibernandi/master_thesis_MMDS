            "text": "We're so excited to share with you the 2,000 person that's been rescued.  She originally was from Africa and she heard about a job opportunity in the Middle East.  She got on an airplane and showed up in the Middle East not knowing anyone and her passport was immediately taken from her.  So the false employment agencies are traffickers.  This is a common story for a lot of girls when they are desperate to provide for themselves or for their family.  The girls that are being trafficked think that they are going to have a fabulous job.  They think that they're going to make enough money for themselves and for their family.  And so they sign up with these employment agencies who buy them an airplane ticket and then they say that there's someone that will meet you in the Middle East when you land.  Almost immediately their passport is taken from them.  And so now you're in a country you've never been to and you no longer have proof of documentation.  Rachel arrived in the Middle East.  They beat her.  They starved her.  They made her work 18 hours a day with little to no food, even at the end of the day when she got done.  And then they also forced her to perform sexual acts.  She felt like she wanted to commit suicide or that she would die at the hands of these traffickers that were holding her captive. ",

We have a Ugandan girl, there's debt bondage, she's got to pay all this amount of money and we're trying to raise the money.  But we don't think we have enough resources to buy her out and also repatriate her back to Uganda.  I put on my thinking cap and my thoughts run to Jessica. ",

            "text": "Rachel has a very similar case to many other girls when they get into what's called debt bondage.  And what that means is when the trafficker from the country of origin helps them get to the Middle East, they say that you now owe me this much money for your flight and for all of the documentation.  So that puts them into debt bondage right from the beginning.  And then when the girl escapes or is able to flee from the person that's holding her captive, then they have what's called an overstay fee.  So the police picks them up, but then they get charged for every day that they are there.  that they don't have documentation.  In order for that girl to actually be able to return to her home country, she has to be able to pay back the debt bondage, and she has to be able to pay her overstay fees.  And that was the situation for Rachel.  So Annette reached out to me and said, there's a girl that's been trafficked to the Middle East, and I know that you guys have helped girls get home, and is there anything that you guys could do to help?  We were able to arrange her getting released from prison to go onto the airplane to get back to Africa.  And so Annette and her husband and family went to the airport and personally picked her up and took her back to the aftercare home.  One of the things that we require with helping girls get back is that there's always aftercare.  We want girls that when they return to wherever they were trafficked from to make sure that there is solid and quality care. ",

She had come to a point of healing where she had been able to start thinking about those things again.  Her dream is to become a fashion designer.  I cannot tell you how incredible it was to see her smile, to see her living in freedom.  One of the things that she said to me was, You've rescued me from the dead.  If it's just for the one, it's always worth it.  If it was all just for Rachel, it's 100% worth it. ",
