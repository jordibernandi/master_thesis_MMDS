            "text": "what's going on.  guys welcome to the video.  it's salt mining season.  as you might have guessed a lot of these celebrities who were supporting jeremy corbyn are remoning like you've never heard before to the point where even lily allen has been suspended from twitter or at least was.  i don't know if that's still the case.  it definitely was about an hour or so ago.  But anyway, the Evening Standard are reporting on this, which is not something we generally look at here.  But Labour supporters Stormzy, Lily Allen and Owen Jones react to devastating result as hope turns to despair.  Wankers.  Labour supporters were full of hope on voting day, having watched the polls narrow between them and the Tories during the final days of the election.  No, they were full of hope, they were just delusional, running on Swinson-level politics there.  Then came the devastating exit poll.  And as election night drew into the morning, the undeniable crushing defeat showed in the reaction of those who supported the party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn.  Boris Johnson's Conservative Party won a majority of 364 seats.  I thought it was 364, not 363.  I'm sure it's 364 seats in Parliament.  A 43% share of the votes, compared with 203 MPs elected from Labour.  Mr Johnson took to the stage to announce how he had a stonking mandate to get Brexit done.  The pound jumped up with the news and Mr Corbyn said he would not lead his party in another general election, which is another good thing, or technically it might not be a good thing because Corbyn leading the Labour Party makes them unelectable.  So technically, Corbyn stepping down is not really that good.  Keeping him there is great because he's never getting elected.  You've seen that this time.  Not even his free everything could get him elected.  Talking to ITV, writer and political commentator Owen Jones, who had campaigned for Labour, said it's a catastrophic result for the country and for everything that the Labour Party exists to fight for.  The people it was founded to champion, to represent.  And I am sorry to the people watching this who are full of dismay, horror and who are scared.  Excuse me, Owen Jones, but the reason Labour lost is because they went against everything they've stood for.  What you want is to go with what Corbyn wants, not what the Labour Party has always done, which is the working class, of course.  You want to follow Corbyn down his Marxist route, which is not something Labour voters want.  These are working class people at the end of the day.  They're not the little rich university kids on Twitter or in your London bubble, mate.  I'm sorry.  The columnist said he thought Labour's position in themselves as the compromised party of Brexit did not work in today's polarised society.  He also apologised on Twitter to his followers.  I'm so, so sorry guys.  Just utterly devastating.  Brexit just smashed us.  Oh yeah, it did, mate.  It smashed you again.  Keeping together an electoral coalition of Remainers and Leavers as the country bitterly divided just became impossible.  Well, that's funny because Boris Johnson seems to have done that.  I'm pretty sure everyone who voted for the Conservative Party is not a Leaver at the end of the day.  I'm sure plenty of people who voted Conservative are going to be Remainers.  So no, Owen Jones, once again, you're just talking shit.  Next up, we have British musician Stormzy.  Musician's a funny name, he's an MC.  last time I heard, but musician will go with that.  It's kind of derogatory to him, or it would be to any rapper from back in my day anyway, but yeah, we'll carry on.  Stormzy spoke to his 2.7 million Instagram followers on election day, urging people not to be stupid and to vote.  admitting it would be the first time he's cast his own ballot.  A video and a number of impassioned tweets earlier in December showed the rapper's desire for Labour to do well.  The grime rapper has backed Mr Corbyn throughout his leadership, describing him in the past as a man of hope.  And there's his Twitter video, I'm not going to play it because no one gives a fuck.  Just after 10pm when the exit poll was announced, Stormzy retweeted a post written by another user which read, Whatever happens tonight, at Jeremy Corbyn, has been a fantastic Labour leader.  Yes, he has been a fantastic Labour leader if you're a Conservative.  Because he has helped them get in.  Along with all of you Ramonin celebrities.  You lot don't realize that the people.  don't give a fuck what you've got to say.  We really couldn't care less.  There is no celebrity on this planet that is going to change my vote.  I'll vote for who I want to at the end of the day.  And I'm sure 99% of the country will do the same as we have seen.  So much for your youthquake and all this nonsense.  Didn't happen, did it?  He has provided genuine hope for the youth of this country and enabled us to imagine better conditions for ourselves.  Um, no he hasn't because he's not been in power once, so he hasn't enabled you to do shit.  He's just gave you a load of talk and you've believed it, like good little sheeple.  He boldly spoke out against injustice and inequality.  I will always respect him.  What about his speaking out in support of terrorist Stormzy?  Do you support that?  I wonder if many of the little children would feel the same way about him supporting terrorists because I guarantee they don't know that.  He then shared with his 1.3 million Twitter followers a post by Mehdi Hussain which called Friday's result a dark day for minorities in the UK.  It says Mr Hussain wrote especially for British Muslims who watched as a man who said Islam was the problem mocked veiled Muslim women and also turned a blind eye to massive anti-Muslim hatred in his party was just given a landslide majority by their fellow Britons.  Oh, just fuck off, you idiot.  I'm sick of these people talking shit.  In response to pictures of long queues of young people at polling stations, actor Hugh Grant posted an encouraging tweet to young people prior to the closure of the polls, writing, youth keep quaking amazing.  Where's that youth quake then, Grant, you idiot?  Hey, where is it?  I don't see it.  The Tories have got a massive majority.  The youth quake might have been for the Tories, it seems.  The film star has been active in canvassing with MPs in favour of voting tactically to push Tory MPs out of swing seats.  Well, it looks like it didn't happen and you just wasted your time.  You probably helped the Tories, as Good Morning Britain's Piers Morgan said.  His later tweets were decidedly less emphatic, writing there goes the neighbourhood after the exit polls were revealed, which is amazing considering this is a rich guy who doesn't live in any neighbourhood that's going to suffer from any government anywhere.  Maybe Labour government he would have suffered from, but I'm pretty sure he would have just moved to Hollywood if he doesn't already live there.  He then retweeted a post by fellow English actor David Schneider, who said 88% of Tory ads contained lies.  They lied RE Brexit, 50k nurses, 40 hospitals, they faked the video, and a fact-check site.  Which is bollocks, they didn't fake a fact-check site, they changed their Twitter handle to a fact-check site.  As a joke, you imbeciles.  the patheticness of these things are stupid.  they fake news about a four-year-old and labor spending.  they paid for bots to spread fake news.  they suppressed the russian report.  conclusion lies work.  oh yeah god what a surprise any of that little spiel was.  Grant replied with, yes, but lies unravel.  Yes, Grant, your lies have unraveled and served the Labour parties.  Most of the country didn't end up voting for them, so your lies didn't work, did they?  They unraveled before they'd even started.  Steve Coogan had spoken out in favour of Labour in a number of social videos and TV appearances.  Prior to the result, the actor and comedian said his famed character Alan Partridge would have voted conservative because he is ill-informed and ignorant.  Going to show just how out of touch these celebrities really are.  And there's the election map there.  Very blue.  The quip meant he came under fire from none other than the Good Morning Britain and former News of the World editor, Piers Morgan, who took swipes at both him and Hugh Grant for being self-entitled and sneering.  Morgan has since tweeted, congrats Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, you helped get Boris a landslide, which technically they did.  Coogan, who does not have public social media accounts, has so far not given a public reaction to the result.  And this is Jack Munro, British food writer and poverty campaigner.  Jack Munro wrote a Twitter thread suggesting what those who disagree with Tory policy should do post-election.  Munro wrote, we grieve for a bit and then we help the most vulnerable in any way we can.  Singer Lily Allen has been tweeting most of the night in reaction to the Tory landslide and posted in disbelief of the early predictions.  The Grammy Award winner had shared a video of her showing her emotional reaction to the Labour manifesto on the day it was released.  We've all seen that nonsensical post.  She posted it on social media site TikTok.  Allen had used a crying filter which had some believing she was shedding tears over the political document.  I think she was or is pretty pathetic if she was pretending to.  With the inevitable reality of defeat, Allen reflected on the campaign and the tactics used by the Conservative Party in their campaign, which has been criticised.  Of course, everyone's been criticising the Conservative Party because they didn't want them to win.  Love Island celebrity and irrelevant who?  Love Island what?  This is not a celebrity, it's just a Love Island idiot.  Amber, who had revealed her political side during the campaign, only retweeted the Labour victory in Newcastle Central as MP Chiawona took the seat with 21,000 votes to the Conservatives' 9,000.  That's because that looked like the Labour were doing well until it started going the other way.  This morning, many anti-Tory voters have taken to Twitter, posting using the hashtag not my government to express their upset at the loss.  And guys, I've got to say, the hashtag Twitter is not my prime minister, not my government are just for fake.  We're not going to bother dealing with them here.  Maybe one day we'll have a look at all these Ramona's tweets, maybe tonight or maybe tomorrow.  Who knows?  But this article here goes to show you that these celebrities really should keep themselves out of politics because no one listens to them.  As a matter of fact, they actually turn people off, I expect.  And Lily Allen, as I said, has been suspended from Twitter the last time I checked.  I'm not exactly sure what she has done, but claims are at the moment that she called people racist and obviously they've reported her.  So her account's been suspended.  I will update in a dedicated video if there is actually anything to update on the situation.  situation.  but on that note I am going to end the video there.  guys I want to thank the channel's PayPal Patreon subscribe star and YouTube members for supporting the channel.  along with everyone who watches my videos.  remember to let me know what you guys think down in the comment section below.  leave a like subscribe with the notification bell and share this video as it helps the channel a lot and I'll see you all in the next one.  This Parliament is a dead Parliament.  It should no longer sit.  It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.  They don't like the truth.  Twice they have been asked to let the electorate decide upon whether they should continue to sit in their seats while they block 17.4 million people's votes.  This Parliament is a disgrace.  But they're too cowardly to give it away.  But the time is coming, the time is coming, Mr Speaker, when even these turkeys won't be able to prevent Christmas.  There is a pattern consistent throughout history of oppressed people turning on the oppressors.  Slaves against their owners.  The peasantry against the feudal barons.  Colonies, Mr Verhofstadt, against their empires.  And that is why Britain is leaving.  And it doesn't matter which language you use, we are going and we are glad to be going.  We're off! ",
