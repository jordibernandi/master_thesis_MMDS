            "text": "Hi, I'm Dr.  Dave Janda.  Welcome back to Dave versus the MSM.  Today's episode is going to focus on President Trump and the deep state's illegal surveillance activity.  Look, whether it's the recent developments with the Jesse Smollett letting them off the hook case, or whether it's Benghazi, or whether it's the deal cut between Obama's Justice Department and Hillary and her lawyers to block access to her emails.  It all comes down to corruption, coercion, and compromise.  The bottom line is, is that it all comes down to leverage.  And the way the deep state gets leverage is with information.  You know, Larry Klayman in a recent article in the New American Magazine, and I encourage you to get that magazine.  In fact, I'm going to have a link to an article that's entitled Whistleblower, Obama-era deep state surveillance program spied on Trump, judges, and others.  Actually, others, millions of others, including you and me.  It was written by C. Mitchell Shaw, and it was published in the New American Magazine.  Larry Klayman, who's a fantastic attorney, actually probably one of the most feared attorneys by the deep state because of his track record of taking him on.  He states that the purpose of that illegal deep state surveillance program is for, quote, potential coercion, blackmail, or other nefarious purposes, end quote.  I couldn't agree more with him.  In fact, whether it's Smollett, Benghazi, or Hillary's emails, the reason why we get this two-tiered rule of law system or rule of no law system is because of leverage.  We have pointed out on our show, Operation Freedom, as well as our YouTube show here on Operation Freedom and our subscription platform, that the Deep State was involved in an illegal surveillance program by the name of The Hammer.  This program was started very soon after Obama took office, and it was directed by Obama, his director of the CIA, Brennan, and his director of national intelligence, Clapper.  They illegally surveilled the emails, phone calls, internet activities, and financial transactions of not just Donald Trump, not just General Flynn, not just his team, Supreme Court justices, I believe 159 other just judges around our country, and millions of Americans to get information that could be used as a later date to get their agenda over the goal line.  And this is what has recently been exposed.  And in fact, we exposed it as far back as March 19th, 2017, with General Tom McInerney on our Operation Freedom radio show.  This Sunday, General McInerney is coming back for another interview on our radio show, as well as Kevin Shipp.  We are going to further dissect these issues of how the deep state gets their information, and once they have that information, how they utilize that to get such aberrant decisions as what happened with the Jesse Smollett case, why folks stood down in Benghazi and didn't rescue those Americans, and why four Americans lost their lives, of why and how a deal can be cut between Obama's Justice Department, Hillary's lawyers, and Hillary so that access to her emails and her servers was blocked.  It all comes down to leverage.  and the leverage is based on the information that the deep state has obtained illegally.  That's what we're going to discuss, and that's what we're going to present in our show.  I'll hope you join us this Sunday.  Operation Freedom, you can stream it live, free.  Go to davejanet.com.  It's from 2 to 5 Eastern.  Just hit the listen button in the upper right-hand corner.  Great analysis, great guests.  Information I guarantee to you will never be seen, heard, read, or experienced through the bought-off lamestream fake media.  Please also join us.  not just on our YouTube channel where we're here 24-7 for you but also at davejanna.com.  we have a free a public side.  also the subscription side 30 cents a day I believe one if not the biggest bang for the buck in all of the internet.  I am going to be having a link right underneath this video for the new American article that I believe you not only need to read it you need to network it because it really lays bare what the deep state is doing to adversely affect our country and your freedoms and my freedoms and every American's freedoms.  Until next time, Dave Janda signing off.  Thanks for your time.  Dream big and dare to fail. ",
