            "text": "It's decision time.  It's time to put the toys away.  It's time to stop playing games.  You cannot sit on the fence for one moment longer.  By the end of this video, you need to make a decision.  You need to decide what you are going to do.  In 1 Kings chapter 18, verse 21, the prophet Elijah asks a very, very pressing question, which you need to think about this very day.  He says, How long will you waver between two opinions?  If the Lord is God, we'll serve him.  But if Baal is God, we'll serve him.  When Alexander the Great was asked, how did you manage to conquer the whole world?  His answer was, by not wavering.  And the Hebrew word for wavering means to limp.  So in other words, you've got one foot in the kingdom of God and you've got one foot in the world and it's literally crippling you, this indecision.  You've listened to the oldest lie which the devil told Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.  He convinced them that they were missing out.  You feel as though God is holding back some superior pleasure from you.  You feel as though there's a box that this Christianity is keeping you in.  And you just want to get out of the box and you want to escape.  You feel as though there's advantages to sin but there's also advantages to the Christian life.  But today, this very day, you need to make a decision.  You can't keep going to church on Sunday and saying amen to the message.  Nodding your head, praying like a saint.  You lift your hands up in praise and everyone looks at you and thinks you are a devout Christian.  But on Monday you live like the world.  On Monday you are just like the devils of this world.  You smoke pot.  You cuss.  You swear.  You watch filth on the internet.  You have sex outside of marriage.  You go to parties.  You live like the world and no one can tell who your spiritual father is.  Whether it's God the father or whether the father of lies is your dad.  No one can tell the difference.  But know this.  God will not be mocked.  your sins will find you out and you need to make a decision whom you will serve this day whether it be God or whether it be the devil.  I'm talking now to you brothers and sisters in Christ.  I had no idea this was the video I was going to make today but I feel as though this is the video the Lord wants you to hear this very day and I'm telling you today enough is enough.  how much longer will you carry on sinning?  you know I'm a married man And there is nothing which breaks my heart, there is nothing which produces more wrath, more anger than when I see another man try and flirt with my wife.  That makes me so angry.  But did you know this brothers and sisters in Christ?  You are married to God.  And the Bible says, the Lord thy God is a jealous God.  So whenever you go off cheating on him, it produces anger, it produces jealousy in him because you belong to him.  He bought you with his son's blood and you better be obedient to him.  You better be faithful to the God who sent his son, Jesus Christ, to bleed and die on a cross so that he might redeem you and have you all to himself.  Oh, precious friends, I plead with you today.  How many more sermons will you hear?  How many more prayers will go up?  How many more weeks of rebellion?  How many more wars will pass?  How many more days, months, years will go on until you finally make a decision?  You know what you need to do as I've been preaching this message.  You know in your heart what you need to do, what you need to give up on.  But whatever you do, you need to make a decision today.  Either you say, the devil, yes, he is going to be my spiritual father and I'll go into the world and I'll end up in hell for eternity.  Or you say, no, today, this very day, I'm going to give all to the Lord God.  He is going to be my father.  I'm going to follow after him.  But whatever you do, stop wavering.  God deserves your all.  You either give him 100% or you give him nothing at all.  So you need to make a decision right now.  It's decision time.  You decide today, whom will you serve?  God or the devil? ",
