            "text": "I'd be talking about the African-American community, and I'd go through a list of worst poverty levels ever, worst crime ever, worst schools ever, worst this.  I'd go through 10 things.  I'd read off from a list.  And at one big rally at 25,000 people, I said, go with me.  What the hell do you have to lose?  Remember that, Candace?  I said, what do you have to lose?  You're doing the worst in every category.  You're getting just, it's terrible.  What the hell do you have to lose?  And I'll never forget, I got off stage and my people came, sir, that wasn't very nice.  I said, no, it's true.  What do they have to lose?  And you went with me and I did get a good vote.  I have to say, you went with me and now you have the best employment numbers you've ever had, the best numbers, the best poverty numbers.  So it's good.  But we will never let that happen, where they take away your country.  We will uphold the sacred principle of government by and for the people \u2014 that's you \u2014 the corrupt forces in Washington.  And they are corrupt, and that includes the media, because large parts of the media \u2014 not all of it, you have some great journalists, reporters \u2014 but large portions of the media are corrupt.  perpetrating these hoaxes like never before.  The very same people who have made a living selling out American workers to foreign countries.  They were closing the factories.  You're losing your jobs.  They leave our country.  They make the product.  They sell the product in.  No tax, no nothing.  So we ended up with empty factories.  and no jobs, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, and jobs by the millions.  These are the same bought and paid for politicians who let special interests write the laws, who push trade policies to enrich foreign nations, and who beg far-left judges to rewrite the Constitution of the United States to impose their own extreme ideology.  No one in America has been hurt more as a result of the Democrats' corrupt leadership and socialist policies than our nation's African American communities.  It's true.  That's true.  It's true.  For a hundred years, for a hundred years, African Americans have gone with the Democrats.  Has it worked?  hasn't worked for, actually, I guess, Candace, it's even more, but 100 years.  And you look at what's going on in the cities run by these crazy left Democrats, and what's going on is not good.  My administration is fighting with everyone in all our heart to reverse the pain inflicted.  by Democrat leaders and to deliver hope and opportunity and prosperity for all Americans, but for African American communities all throughout our land.  Together, we will express the corruption.  We will defeat the socialists.  We will defraud.  And I will tell you what, we will do what we have to do, but we will stop defrauding all of the people in our country, because they've defrauded the people in our country, we'll defend democracy, and, yes, we will drain the swamp.  That's what we'll do.  African Americans built this nation.  We built this nation.  You know, you're just starting to get real credit for that, okay?  I don't know if you know that.  You're just starting to get \u2014 you built the nation.  We all built it.  But you were such a massive part of it \u2014 bigger than you were given credit for.  Does that make sense?  Right?  But through generations of blood, sweat, and tears \u2014 and you deserve a government that defends your interests, protects your families, and cares for our own citizens first.  We're having such success.  We're showing them what's going on.  When you look at your unemployment numbers, how great they are \u2014 the best in history.  You look at your employment numbers.  You look at the poverty numbers.  You look at all of the things that have been so beneficial.  It's driving them crazy, because they never produced numbers like that.  And they're losing African American votes, and they can't do that.  I just can't do that.  They haven't done anything for you.  They haven't done anything.  A hundred years, they haven't done anything.  At long last, you have a government that puts Americans first, puts you first, puts your families and your communities first.  We're adopting Buy American trade policies to stand up for our workers.  Our tax and regulatory reforms are stopping the outsourcing of jobs, where they outsource all your jobs.  to other countries, and keeping businesses in America where they belong.  And keep your jobs where your jobs belong.  We're fighting every day to secure our nation's borders and to achieve an immigration system that prioritizes American families, wage earners, taxpayers, and people that can help you and can help our country.  To keep our cities safe, we're supporting the brave men and women of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.  And you'd be amazed at how many African American people come up, and they have people living near them that are brutal killers.  They're killers.  But you're tough.  You fight back.  But sometimes you don't win those fights.  Because these guys are tough, too.  They shouldn't be in our country.  Thousands and thousands of zones in inner cities and poor neighborhoods.  Tremendous investments going in.  Tremendous jobs are happening.  Revitalization is happening.  It's been incredible for the African-American community.  I don't think there's ever been anything \u2014 it's early yet, it's a year and a half \u2014 but, Jerron, I don't think we've ever had anything quite like it.  And people don't like writing about it because they don't want to give the Trump administration credit.  But I'm used to that.  I'm used to it.  You got to get used to it.  You know.  who knows, though?  The people know.  The people know.  But because \u2014 no, thank you.  because really no American community is going to be left behind, any community, to help former prisoners get a second chance at life.  We passed groundbreaking, and this is with liberals and conservatives.  Some of the most conservative people in the Republican Party were so in favor of it.  Senator Lee, Mike Lee of Utah, great guy.  Senator Grassley, great guy, Iowa.  So many people.  Criminal justice reform.  Everybody said it couldn't be done.  And a group came to my office.  Sir, please, please, would you help us?  These were liberal people.  And I said, I will.  Van Jones was one.  Nice guy.  I wouldn't say he treats me too good, but that's okay.  Van Jones.  And he said, sir, we need your help.  We can't get five senators.  We can't get this.  We can't get that.  We need your help.  We need your help.  Please, sir, help me.  Please help me.  I said, I can get you those five senators.  And I called five or six or seven to get the five.  Sometimes you have to call a little more than the five if you want to get the five, right?  You'll learn.  Couple said, could I take a pass on this, sir?  But I got five people.  Right, Jared?  And we got the vote, and people were shocked.  And nobody else could have done it.  And they've been trying to change this for the African American community, for the Hispanic community, for other communities.  But really, the African American and Hispanic communities, by far, benefited the most.  And they've been trying to do this for decades.  But I did want to say, Sylvain Jones was on about two weeks ago.  And he came to me, and I'm telling you, he was so nice.  He was sitting right there when I was doing it, and I said, thank you, Van Jones.  Thank you, this one, this one, that one, that one.  And that was it.  And he came up to me, thanked me, and that was it.  Then, about three weeks ago, I saw him on television.  I don't watch his show too much.  Neither do too many.  But I'm watching him.  And he gets up and he goes, I want to thank a number of people, because we did something this year that was undoable.  They said it couldn't be done.  We passed criminal justice reform.  Okay?  Van Jones said it.  And I want to thank Reverend Al Sharpton.  Well, he wasn't nowhere.  He was nowhere to be found.  Just so we know.  I've known him for a long time.  He used to love me.  We used to go to fights together with Don King.  Don King's a friend of mine.  Don King endorsed me.  And Don King and Al Sharpton get along.  We used to go to fights together.  And he liked me until I ran and succeeded in politics.  Then it wasn't to his benefit.  But, look, Al's a con man.  We all know that, okay?  Just a con man.  He's a con man.  And he scared, uh... NBC and to give him in a show, you know, they don't want to have any trouble But he's a just a sort of a third-rate con guy, but his his Van Jones his Van Jones Van Jones, I want to thank Al Sharpton.  I want to thank all these people.  I never heard of.  The only one he didn't mention was me and then it got worse.  You ready?  Candace listen to this Terrence, are you listening?  So he named these people, a lot of people, standing at the end of a shelf.  I want to thank, because this was the greatest year we've ever had.  We got criminal justice reform.  I want to thank this one and that one and that one.  I never heard of it.  And I kept waiting for my name.  I said, darling, come over here.  I'm going to have a great little name mention.  Yes, darling, first lady.  How good is the first lady?  So she came over here.  And I kept waiting.  And I kept waiting.  And then he named a lot of people.  That was the end.  I said, I was a little embarrassed in front of my wife.  I said, he didn't name me.  I'm the one that did it.  I called up Jared, right, Jared?  I said, what the hell is this?  But before that, he did have one other thing to say.  This was three weeks ago.  He said, and I have one thing to say that we have to do.  We must defeat this president.  We have to defeat President Trump.  And we have to work 24 hours a day to defeat President Donald Trump.  And I called Jared, and I said, that's terrible.  Right?  Is that a true story?  And then he spoke to Jared, and he apologized, didn't he?  He apologized.  But I don't accept those apologies.  Should we get back on the script?  Okay.  No, they say, no, this is more it.  They don't want to go back on it.  This is much more it.  We love you folks, okay?  We love you.  Van Jones.  Van Jones.  He's another beauty.  Thank you very much, Van, for the wonderful acknowledgement.  I appreciate it.  To give every American child the best chance to reach the American dream, we're fighting for school choice.  Very important.  Sadly, Democrat lawmakers care more about catering to lobbyists and powerful teachers unions than they do about improving our schools for our children.  And Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than about their own African American constituents.  They want to give healthcare to people that just walked into the country, and for you, they don't care.  The whole thing is crazy.  These people have gone absolutely nuts. ",
