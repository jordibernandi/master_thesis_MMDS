            "text": "Aloha men and ladies, if there's any watching, I doubt it.  Today we're going to talk about five weird situations I've been in whenever I've gone over to a woman's house for the first time.  For some reason, I always end up going back to their homes.  I don't know why.  But I do like it that way because A, you don't know where I live, which is probably a good thing because a lot of these women are nuts.  And B, I get to see a little bit of how you live because I know how I live and I know how I take care of my life.  I want to see how do you do yours.  So, without further ado, these are five random, no-order things that I've ran into while dating and meeting a woman and going over to their house for the first time.  Oh, and before we get started, thank you again for everybody who's subscribing.  We're over 250 people now.  I mean, it's just... We're cranking right along.  I really love the comments.  You guys have been super positive about all your comments.  And, you know, I just feel like I'm coming at this at a little bit of a different angle than a lot of these guys.  I'm just a real dude.  I'm a single father just trying to take care of my life.  I'm not rich.  I don't have a ton of money.  I don't have a bunch of equipment and all this shit.  It's just me.  So I really appreciate you tuning in.  All right.  Number one, dirty toilet.  My toilet's clean.  I hope your toilet's clean too.  And if it's not, go clean it.  But when I walk into a chick's house, I do not want to see rings and stains in the toilet.  I just don't want to see it.  And I've seen that multiple times.  I mean, multiple, multiple times have I been to a home either of a woman or that has a woman in the home and that toilet is disgusting.  That should not be acceptable, guys.  I mean, it's not acceptable.  It's unacceptable.  And I don't care if you're renting and that was the way the toilet was whenever you moved in.  You need to call your landlord and tell him, I want a new toilet.  They're like a hundred bucks, right?  And if he can't put a toilet in, I don't know what kind of landlord he is, but it's a hundred bucks.  Get a new toilet.  I don't want to be pooping on top of your old stains.  That's just disgusting.  So, and yes, I will poop in your house if I want to.  Pile of clothes on the floor.  Now I get it guys, I'm guilty of that from time to time, but why are women, I thought that was one of their things was laundry and taking care of these precious clothes that they have so they look good all the time.  And so many times.  if I walked into a woman's house and just had a pile of clothes on the floor, and then we'll go at it and afterwards she'll throw me a towel and I'll be like, Is this a clean towel, a dirty towel?  You just got it off the floor.  It feels a little bit wet.  I don't know.  Is it damp?  I can't tell.  I don't want nothing to do with it, right?  My ex used to do laundry one day a week.  Four people lived in this house and she would do it one day a week.  Every Sunday would be laundry day and she would spend, she'd waste her entire Sunday doing laundry.  Insanity.  I mean, me with my two kids.  now, I probably do a load of laundry.  I'm doing some right now.  So I probably do it at least a couple times a week.  I do a load of laundry probably two, three times a week.  I'm running something through the laundry machine.  So pile of dirty clothes on the floor.  just fold your shit right?  I hang my stuff up I put it away I keep everything in a basket.  it's not that hard right?  just take care of your life.  sleeping with a gun on the nightstand.  this is a weird one so I'm nothing against guns.  I got no issues with it.  I love to go shoot guns.  I no problem with it.  I'm a big believer in it that you should be able to have your guns and and all those things.  I would never say anything against it.  but I Only one time have I met a girl, and this was in Florida, of course, where she was sleeping with a gun on her nightstand.  A little weird, okay?  A little bit of a trust issue there, right?  I got to worry about now you pulling out a gun, or just not even pulling out a gun, just grabbing it off the nightstand and just whacking me with it, shooting me, whatever you want to do.  Though this girl was also, she was a photographer, so aren't they all?  And she was also the one that we started going at it for the first time, and she said, choke me.  obliged.  No problem there.  That was right after my divorce and I was learning some, some new steps down in Florida.  And, uh, that one was definitely added to my repertoire.  So sleeping with a gun on nightstand.  it threw me off a little bit.  Oh, and then when I broke up with that chick and you know, at this point I had already broken up with my, my ex wife and we did our divorce and all that stuff.  So that was hard, right?  You're talking 10 years.  I thought it was a one and done.  I was going to be married for all my life.  All thrown to the curb.  Uh, that was a hard one to go through for me.  Looking back, it was easy.  I mean, now I laugh at it, but at the time it was emotionally hard on me.  So breaking up with this chick after dating for maybe four or five months, there's a walk in the park, right?  I just called her up.  Hey, can we have a talk?  I'm going to stop over.  Boom, boom, boom.  It's not working out.  I'll see you later.  She goes, I hid my gun.  Is that all?  We're not going to fight?  And I said, no.  Well, I hid my gun because I was afraid that something was going to happen and that I was going to.  You thought that I was going to take your gun and shoot you with it?  Cute.  Teenage kid that is your best friend.  First of all, I'm sorry, ladies, but if you are in your mid to late 30s and you already have a teenage child that's paying taxes and living an adult life, something's up there, right?  I mean, you had to have had that kid really young.  Clearly the guy's not gonna be around, right?  Nine times out of 10, those young births like that are just a hot mess.  And I gotta tell you something, ladies, if you're watching this and you have an older teenage kid like that, They're not your friend, okay?  You are not a friend.  You are their mother.  You are the parent.  You can be friendly, but you are not the friend.  I always say raising children is kind of like having like a dog, right?  You have to be the pack leader.  You have to roll with an iron fist, if you will.  It's what's going to help them grow, right?  They see lackadaisy things all day long.  When they come home, it needs to be firm.  It needs to be by the books and by the rules.  They have to respect that person.  She don't respect you when you're your friend.  But we're hanging out.  We go on a date, right?  First date.  First time I ever met this girl.  First date.  We go out.  We hit up a movie.  We hit up a little bit of food.  And then she goes, hey, do you want to come back to my place and hang out?  Because it was kind of snowing.  And I was like, yeah, she lived close by.  I head back to her place.  We're sitting there hanging out.  Next thing I know, I hear the door opening.  I'm like, what the hell's going on here?  Her teenage daughter comes walking in.  I didn't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just sitting there with this woman.  I'm thinking about like, hey, we're going to maybe, you know, bang one out tonight.  And teenage daughter comes walking in.  You could at least warn me, right?  You could have at least let me know that she was coming.  We're like best friends.  I'm surprised she's not pregnant yet, the daughter, which probably she's on the road to because she was like 18 moving in with her boyfriend.  I don't know the whole story.  They're giving me this whole story as she sits down and talks to me whenever all it was on my mind was trying to plow mom.  So thanks a lot, teenage daughter.  Blocked it.  Pets.  Pets, pets, pets.  Cats are okay, right?  A woman can have a cat.  She can have two cats.  She can have as many cats as she wants.  Cats are pretty normal.  As long as she can keep up on keeping that box of litter cleaned up, that's about all you got to do with a cat, right?  Feed it, clean the litter, and it'll take care of itself.  Women cannot have dogs.  And that's like a big push now, right?  All these women have dogs now.  They can't get a guy and they're lonely and they want companionship and they go and they buy a dog.  Like I just said before, raising kids and raising a dog is kind of the same thing.  You gotta be the pack leader.  You have to be the alpha, right?  That's what they're looking for.  They need to be put into their place and they need to know who's boss.  Women can't do that.  They're just not good at it.  They're not good at being the boss.  So when that dog does something wrong, it's, oh, stop it.  Oh my, oh my God, stop chewing that.  Oh, get out of here.  Like they just, they don't know what to do.  When I got my dog, one of the first things I did when he did something bad, I wrestled him down to the ground.  I put his ear in my mouth, just like the mom would or the dad would.  And I gave him a bite on the ear until he yelped, right?  Sounds crazy.  I know, worked perfect.  Ever since that day, that dog has known, I am the boss.  Same way with my kids.  My kids know when they're acting up, I can give them a look and I'll just hit them with it, blue steel.  And they might be running their mouth, yap, yap, yap.  And I give them that, I go, hey, and I give them that look and they look at me and we make that eye contact and they just zip it right up because they know I'm in charge.  I'm the boss.  So I can be their friends.  But now the weird thing too, though, is Girls with pets, like dogs.  I've never met a girl with a dog.  that's been anything good.  And I just seen a post the other day on Facebook that was like, top 10 places in Pittsburgh this year to take your dog to get a drink, right?  Top 10 places I'm not going to this year, that's for damn sure.  But all these women are responding to it, right?  No men, just tons and tons of women respond.  Oh my God, I can't wait.  Oh my God, we're gonna go here and get some food and we're gonna take the dogs and we're gonna get drinks and we're all gonna have girl night with the dogs and... No interest at all.  And any of the weird pets?  You ever been with a girl that has the weird pets?  Like I dated a girl one time that had ferrets.  Ugh.  God, the smell in that house nonstop.  I thought a litter box was bad.  And that girl had, she had I think two or three cats too.  She had big giant... Tupperware tubs or whatever you want to call them, just filled with litter.  Two of them in the house for these cats to go.  It was just disgusting.  The house just stunk.  Stunk.  Zero interest in ferrets.  Zero interest in cats or whatever.  And when my dog passes away, I don't know if I'll ever have another one again.  Man, they are a lot of work.  Definitely women with dogs.  That dog will be the bane of your existence.  And they always sleep with the dog too, which is always annoying.  That's the last thing you need in the bed.  is a dog in the bed with them.  And they always buy the weird dogs too, right?  They'll always go get like pit bulls and stuff.  And they'll be like, I'm rescuing him.  And those dogs need attention.  Those dogs need a lot of work.  right?  And then they want to, they want to lock them into a little crate because they don't want to mess up their precious, beautiful apartment while they go to their crap job all day that they went to school and paid 180 grand for, which they're hoping that you will gladly pay off for them.  That's another video.  Um, but yeah, stick away from the chicks with the pets, man.  Pets are just a mess.  all right that's another five.  that's it for today.  i gotta go do some stuff for my business again.  i appreciate you guys all for watching.  hope you get a laugh out of this.  let's hear some comments down below some of the crazy situations that you've walked into at a woman's house.  and uh if it's your first time here give me a subscribe give this video a like and i look forward to entertaining everyone more thank you.
