            "text": "Welcome back to Up.  I'm David Gurra.  A candidate for the Democratic nomination who was not on stage in Houston is Marianne Williamson.  She watched that debate with the rest of us.  The primary field is stratifying, and she is among 10 lower-tier candidates who are still on the campaign trail making their case.  But Democratic voters may be getting tired of all the options.  A majority of them say there are way too many candidates as this campaign continues.  As I mentioned, the next debate is in October.  While Marianne Williamson has not qualified, she is halfway there.  She's hit the donor threshold to make the stage.  She needs to get more than 2% in three more qualifying polls.  Thank you very much for being here.  I know it's early out in California as well, so I thank you especially for that.  Let me get back to the debate that happened this week.  As you were watching it, what was the moment or what were the moments when you would have tried to jump in?  There was a long conversation about health care.  There was a part on foreign policy.  There was the part on gun policy.  What was the issue where you would have been raising that hand high trying to get in on the conversation to make yourself differentiated from the rest? ",

            "text": "I did a live stream of my own through my website afterwards in order to present my case and the kinds of things that I would have said.  But you know the problem I have, and this is not a fault of the candidates at all, but the entire situation, is the very fact that we're talking about what's happening in America at this critical time in a way where one person has a little time to talk and then another person tries to get in there.  I have a problem with the entirety of the nature of the debate system.  So I was sort of glad, in a way, to have an opportunity to give a bigger explanation of my feelings about a more just economy, which was not really on the stage.  I have a deeper conversation about war and peace, which was not on the stage, a deeper conversation about children, particularly traumatized children and child poverty, which was not on the stage, and a deeper conversation about race, which was not on the stage.  So there is a whole conversation about what matters in America that many of us are having, or at least I know that I'm having, that was not necessarily encapsulated in that debate at all. ",

            "text": "You know, there was an article written by one of the big Democratic operatives in Iowa, and he said, we don't need the DNC to come in here and tell us who we need to consider as a qualified candidate.  You know, this is all artificial, really.  I mean, I think that the role of the Democratic as well as Republican political establishments is to facilitate the process of democracy, not dictate the process of democracy.  What matters is the voters.  And particularly because I'm a non-establishment candidate, I think voters need more time to think this through.  I have not heard a voter.  I know you said that the polls say voters want to narrow it, but that's not my experience.  People are not children.  These voters are not children.  And this is the most critical.  This is not just the most critical vote in our lifetimes.  This is one of the most critical votes in the history of the United States.  Look what you were talking about in this segment before.  I mean, these are very, very serious issues.  And Democrats have to think not only in terms of where America should go, but we have to think about who would be best to defeat Donald Trump, which is where I feel I have a lot to say.  So I think just this is not time to shut this thing down.  This is time to give the voters an opportunity to think as deeply and reflectively and make as wise choices as possible. ",

I imagine there are skeptics you've talked to who have said, look, you're saying things that are innovative or outside the norm, but the system is what the system is, and they're a matter of months before these primaries begin.  Maybe there isn't a way for you to get through that. ",

But let's think about the Constitution of the United States.  They don't even mention political parties.  The founders didn't.  George Washington warned us against all that.  So what I'm doing is talking to voters.  That's what matters.  You know, we've turned the voters into spectators.  The voters are treated just like... poker chips.  how many do you have?  how many do you have?  it's not that i'm trying to get around the the party's system but i am trying to have a deeper conversation that i believe is more meaningful and more real and i trust the voters i will get out if i get out when i feel that i have made my case to the voters so that they really have an option of of the agenda that i'm talking about both for the country and both for an effort to defeat the president.  So I'm in because my heart says something's going on here.  I'm having a conversation.  As long as people are showing up, as long as people continue to go to Marianne2020.com and fund my campaign because I want a deeper conversation about the basics of our economy, about the injustice of that, about children, about war and peace, about race and about climate change and what we need to do to have a green century.  As long as people are saying, yeah, girl, you go.  I'm going.  It doesn't matter if the DNC goes.  If people are saying, you go, I'm going. ",

I think back on a conversation I had with somebody else who was sitting out during the debate this last week, Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, who has been critical of the Democratic Party as well.  And I wonder if... You know, if you're not elected president, if you're not the nominee, if that's a positive outcome for you, that you've drawn attention to that.  Where do you see the Democratic Party after this election, like the critiques that you've brought to bear and that Governor Bullock and others have brought to bear as well? ",

            "text": "Well, first of all, I don't think any of us can run unless we're serious about wanting to be president of the United States.  I don't think you take on something this difficult just to elevate the conversation.  You're trying to elevate the country.  You're not trying to just influence the conversation.  Who of us really needs to do that?  This is something much more important than that going on.  So I am seeing this in a much more significant way than just trying to influence a conversation.  But I do what I do.  I'm a writer.  I'm an author.  I'm a speaker.  I'm an activist.  Somebody's going to win, and other people who aren't going to win are going to have to decide what they do next.  But I don't want to even be enrolled in the thought that I'm just here to influence the conversation.  You know, when you do that in politics, That means really what's already happening.  If you looked at the candidates the other night, quite a few of them were using phrases like, hello, didn't she say that?  Yeah.  But if all they do is co-opt language and they don't actually realign policy so that we're not just talking a more soulful, more moral America, we're talking more soulful policy, more moral public policy, then the change hasn't happened yet.  So I'm in here more than just to suggest language.  I'm here to try to help change the country.  Joining us. ",
