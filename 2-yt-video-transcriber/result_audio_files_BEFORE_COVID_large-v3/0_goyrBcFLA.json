I didn't think that we... would end up how we did.  But I remember when my heart had started to shift towards him, where I started to have an affection for him, I knew something was different because I was willing to follow him.  We had gifts that were very similar.  He pushed me, not pushed, that sounds terrible, But he stretched me in a way that was welcomed.  And I felt willing to trust him with my heart.  And I didn't feel that for anybody.  And so that was one of the ways I saw, like, man, I think maybe. ",

And I always laugh that they have these really kind of crazy ideas of like, OK, I'm a firstborn, so I could never marry somebody who's a middle child, because that's never going to work.  I'm like, what book did you read that in?  You know?  I kind of feel like whether or not you think he's the one, he becomes the one after you say yes to him.  He becomes the one.  That's the person you promised yourself to.  And of course, you want to make the wisest decision possible.  So you should be in community with people.  Do other people say, this seems really good for you?  Are you the kind of relationship where you sort of isolate yourself from your community, and all of a sudden, you're just this pair that you've lost connection with your friends?  What do your friends say about this?  about this guy, like, does he have really good guy friends?  And for me, when I, similar to you, Jackie, when I met Ryan at Wheaton College, the thing that was really different is that it wasn't that I just liked him or was attracted to him.  I actually admired him.  He was the first man I really admired, where I said, I have so much to learn from him.  I really want to be like him.  I think I want him to teach me things that he obviously knows.  And that, for me, was so different. ",

            "text": "I had with Jeff, we were friends for a solid year before we ever went out.  And I had a huge distrust of romance anyway.  And so I know the Lord knew that was what I needed.  And I grew up with four brothers.  And so I was accustomed to friendships with guys.  And the romance part felt just almost disingenuous to me, I think, because I had enjoyed such good friendships with guys, not just my brothers, but other guys as well.  And I think I always saw marriage as when you give up your male friendships, you know, and And marrying someone who I was really good friends with has been just a delight.  And it has been, I look at the hard marriage stories that we hear in our church, and I'm sure you guys hear them too.  And I think, gosh, I can tell you guys love each other.  I just don't know if you like each other.  And I wish that more women were thinking about marriage.  in terms of, do I feel a genuine just affection for this person as another human being?  Because for the long haul, you're probably going to be more willing to lay down your preferences for someone who you just genuinely like.  Romance is only going to carry you so far.  And we've really encouraged our kids as well, hey, why don't you form good friendships with people of the opposite sex?  Because if you can identify what mutual respect and friendship look like, and then you can have that be part of the marriage relationship, at least in my experience, it has saved us a world of heartache.  And but then, like you said, Jen, not everyone did that before they got married and they find themselves on the other side of it.  It's like now what?  And you're exactly right.  It's well, now how do I show preferential love to this person, even though there are going to be difficulties?  And you do.  You have to look for the things that you can celebrate about them and for the ways that they make you better and focus on those things and nurture those things.  And also, there's no reason that on the far side of a marriage that wasn't founded on friendship that you can't look for ways to develop that around shared interests and all of that. ",

Your lives are changing as you grow and mature.  And I think, you know, I got married at 22. ",

That's why I feel like.  one thing, too, that I really appreciate about Ryan that I saw in him when he was 21 and 22 and I continue to see in him is that he's a learner and a grower and someone who's just committed to, first of all, growing in Christ.  I mean, for sure.  If you can marry somebody whose whole life is given to Christ, who loves the Lord, that goes a long way, right?  I mean, it's kind of that very cliche thing like two people growing toward the Lord are also growing toward each other.  And so if you can marry somebody who's committed to growing in Christ and just growing as a person. ",
