            "text": "Paloma for Trump assaulted for her Trump hat.  You may remember Paloma, also known as Paloma for Trump from our videos from a few months ago where she was in Mexico right over the border trying to help some of the migrants.  as a right-wing Trump supporter opposing the NLG, that is the National Lawyers Guild, you know, the green hat wearing people who you often see running the legal defense for Antifa and BAMN, people that she saw down there exploiting those people, the migrants, for political reasons, while not actually administering humanitarian aid like she was doing.  You see, she's for strong borders, but she's also for helping people.  Here she is with these kids here, from this famous photo here, and if you want to see more about, you know, what she was doing down there, again, scroll down and see the links below.  I'll also give you links to her YouTube channel, which you should check out, and her own videos about this stuff.  Here she is with Trump Jr.  Here she is with Laura Loomer, Ben Berkwam, Joy Villa, Judge Jeanne Pirro.  You know, she gets around.  She's very active.  On April 6th, 2019, she was in a post office and was allegedly assaulted before starting this live stream, after which she was assaulted, as you can see.  It's impossible to look at Paloma and not see that she is not white.  But because she had a Trump hat on, presumably this woman, who seems pretty darn white to me, called her a racist and claimed to not be assaulting Paloma as she assaulted Paloma.  Yeah, it's just the sort of Trump derangement insanity that we've all come to expect from, well, the sort of person that would do something like that, you know? ",

I don't really know how else to contact her.  that she actively checks.  By the way, if she does press charges, does anyone out there know if it's more serious because this took place within a post office being, you know, a federal thing?  I don't know if it's considered a federal space, if the jurisdiction's different there or whatever.  If you know, leave us a comment below.  That would be greatly appreciated.  So there you have it, folks.  Yet another case for the collection that I've been compiling on a webpage of Trump supporters being harassed and or assaulted.  for being, you know, right-wing or Trump supporters or wearing a MAGA hat.  See the link below for more of that.  Also, see the webpage for the collection I've been compiling of Trump supporters harassing or attacking people, of which, so far, I found one case.  And apparently, it was a MAGA hat-wearing person fighting back after someone grabbed, or at least tried to grab, their hat.  So, really... I don't know, is it a case of attack?  I don't really think it is, so maybe I shouldn't even say there's one case that I found.  I mean, it was apparently self-defense.  Subscribe to us on BitChute, folks, because YouTube is phasing out channels like ours, and because of this fact, we have videos that you can only see on BitChute, like a few videos of my lovely wife and co-host Tabby.  Peace for the peaceful, tough love, equality of opportunity, not of outcome, and liberty for those who don't violate the liberty of others.  Thanks for watching. ",
