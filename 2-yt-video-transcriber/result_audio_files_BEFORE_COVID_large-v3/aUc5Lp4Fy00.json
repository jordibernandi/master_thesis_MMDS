Republicans were a rightist center party, but they too had moderates, and they had a liberal wing.  We now have a liberal lump and a conservative lump.  and the middle's gone.  Democrats have pretty much shed their entire conservative wing.  Republicans have pretty much shed their entire liberal wing.  Parties have polarized much more than they used to.
