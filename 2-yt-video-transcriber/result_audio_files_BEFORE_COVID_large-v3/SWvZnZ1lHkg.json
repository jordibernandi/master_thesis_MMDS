            "text": "Now that was utterly ridiculous.  Anytime that black people are trying to do something, here they come trying to harass black folks.  If I see somebody moving in somewhere, I'm not getting involved with that.  I don't care what you got going on.  Obviously if you got a moving truck or you have a mover somewhere, obviously I haven't met with no person that's just moving somewhere that they don't even belong.  That's silly.  That's extremely silly, but it lets you know how miserable this woman is.  And this is the people that UCLA, that's the kind of people that you hired to work there.  Doesn't surprise me at all.  Now this same woman was out arguing and trying to cause a scene and trying to call in the murder of black people.  Well, she left a five year old kid inside of a home.  And when the police got there, they heard both sides of the story.  They went to arrest this particular white supremacist female.  And then they cops came back, told us sister that's recording.  Well, if we arrest her right now, we have to call department, you know, family services and you know, they're going to take the kids.  So we go, it'd be nice if we can kind of wait.  And the sister said, no, you're not going to wait.  No, I'm pressing charges.  And, but they still did not arrest her that time period.  Now, you know, good and well as she was stating here in the email is that If it had been her and the roles reverse, they wouldn't have cared about that child inside that apartment.  They would have arrested her and take that child away.  That's exactly what would happen.  But this doesn't surprise me at all.  You see more and more of this.  They always calling the police for every little thing.  And the times they need to call the police, they don't.  That's why the whole system is unraveling right before.  And that's why you see more of them acting out.  We talking about people.  that's racist.  They're acting out constantly because they don't have it together anymore.  And the reason when you see the uptick of violence and the uptick of harassment is because that's all they really know how to do because they feel that black people now are becoming too uppity.  Understand that.  when you exert yourself and you stand up for yourself, when you demand things politically, They say these black folks have gotten way too uppity and we need to get them back in line.  when he's scared to even look at us in the eye.  See, that's what they want.  Black people, they want black people back to the point where you look on the ground when they pass by.  Understand?  So you've been acting way too uppity.  They blame Barack Obama while we didn't got uppity.  I'm talking about the racist cause.  you know, we've got a lot of people that don't listen very well.  So I have to repeat, I'm talking about racist.  Anyway, so this sister did the right thing by sending us the video.  As I stated in the previous video, when it came to not being a hero with some things, it's better to send it to content creators.  Let us talk about it.  That's what we do.  You have to protect your name.  You have to protect your job.  You have to protect certain things because the thing is with these type of videos, that's coming out.  Even though this one is just something we normally see, but we have to have a different standard operating procedure.  So this woman, Shauna, that's her name that did this.  I hope she is fired actually from her job for acting that way.  Yes, I said fired because that's the only time they realized the error in their ways.  Now before we wrap up the video, you remember that we had to go fund me for the new roof foundation orphanage and I'll be happy to report that we hit the goal on that.  Not as many people that say, well, you know, could we still donate to it?  What we'll do, we'll keep it open until Sunday and then we'll go ahead and close it cause that Monday we'll be leaving.  to go to Kenya.  Now there's also an update that we posted as well with video from the actual orphanage themselves.  And you can go check that out on the page.  And we'll show us a small clip of that as we talking.  But it's like a three minute video.  You could check it out yourself.  There's a lot more content that we could show from that.  But the people that helped out, he had about 104 people.  You know, we thank you for that.  And see, let me tell you something about that.  It's on a small scale.  you see what 104 people can do.  Now, the reason why I've always said that if I had about 3000 solid people, just 3000, I don't need no more than that.  3000 solid people that can do different things.  that can move when it's time to move.  Donate when it's time to donate.  We can literally do so many great things.  I remember when the hurricane came and you had just 300 people had donated to that and how that was just something that was great.  You don't take that many.  So a lot of times people feel that it takes a whole lot of people to make a difference.  No, it don't.  It takes a small amount.  It takes the remnant that can literally change the whole community.  And that's why we got to push more to some of the people.  that as I stated before, that when we come back from Kenya, there's another project I want to get involved with by helping a black run schools.  And I got your names, the ones that were saying that we just need to do something here.  We not worrying about other people.  I'm gonna call you out.  I'm calling you out by name and I got all your names written down.  And I better see you be the first person donating.  We want to do something here in America.  You're here because you talking about taking care of the home front.  Well, I'm gonna call you out and see if you do that.  Leave me a comment.  Let me know.  Think about this particular video.  Uh, what happened to this sister?  But Hey, you know what?  She did the right thing.  She did the right thing.  And this woman is being exposed to her racism because why she just jetted off with her little dogs if she was in the right.  she knew she was in the wrong, but they think they can talk to us and harass us any kind of way.  See, the thing is, it's my job to study racism, white supremacy is my job.  And because I understand it's a mindset that go along with that ideology.  And you know, I'm at a point where I'm just even stopped talking to racism.  to call it terrorism because it is terrorism.  They're terrorizing black people by skin color.  to terrorize and black people in ways to discriminate against them is always built to terrorize black people.  that are racism or racialized terrorism.  then maybe we could change just the paradigm of that.  Because they don't care about being called racist anymore, but being called a racialized terrorist, that is a totally different label that they would have to deal with. ",
