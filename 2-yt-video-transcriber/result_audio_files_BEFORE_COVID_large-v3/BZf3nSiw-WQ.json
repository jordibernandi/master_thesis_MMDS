            "text": "Yesterday I made a video about the impartation that Randy Clark was distributing at Bethel.  After getting a lot of criticism on their Facebook page, Global Awakening took that video down.  Weird, huh?  After telling everyone that the disturbing manifestations are from God, they removed their own video of those very manifestations.  Well, now there's a new video that is equally disturbing.  Here's what it looked like at Bethel's Healing and Impartation Conference on January 30, 2020.  This is the second day of the Bethel Healing and Impartation Conference in Redding, California, and Randy Clark is imparting something all right.  According to Randy Clark's Global Awakening Facebook page, where this video was posted, this is a powerful move of God.  Here's that Facebook page.  Randy Clark is a proven false teacher and false prophet, and he's been teaching this stuff for decades.  Here he is gushing over verified fraud and pervert Todd Bentley back in 2008. ",

And so if they want to go and look to your past and look to the stream you're drawing from, it's the stream of heaven.  And they can't find anything negative in it.  And you are like a, you're like not a preacher nor a preacher's son, but you're like Amos, this prophet that God has raised up to speak to the church and to the world.  And God is going to use you, Todd.  We've been praying.  What we were looking for when I went to see Rodney, and then I did come here in Lakeland.  And when I was prayed for, two weeks before I went to Toronto, and the fire of God came in our hands, and Rodney said all that about it.  But it's interesting that it's starting again in Lakeland because it was initially, I believe it started in Lakeland and spread to Tulsa and then to Toronto and Pensacola and Smith and it went all over the world.  But it's going faster this time.  And also to the people that are watching on television, I know this is going to break out in major revival all over the world.  And I'm just so proud of how you're answering.  And I feel like sometimes they say, well, we can't believe in these healing evangelists in their $5,000 suits.  Well, they can't say that about you.  And I've watched him take food to the poor of Mozambique.  This man has a heart for the poor, for the broken, for the widows.  And I just want to say, I believe in you.  And I want to bless what God is doing through you and bless the people tonight.  And we'd just like to ask you one more time, just lift your hands up.  And I want you to expect heaven to open.  We believe that.  another thing, you were saved right about the time this was going on in Toronto. ",

We ask you to unzipper heaven and pour out your Holy Spirit.  And we ask God that there'd be a release of power coming upon ministers.  There'd be people getting on fire in these meetings and taking it all over the world.  We pray, Father, for the nations.  We pray, Father, those watching on God TV and those watching on the internet.  the pastors that are watching they had really experienced.  I bless you.  now we come together.  we bless you now in the name of Jesus and pray for the fire to come upon you the fire of God to come into your hands.  you begin to sweat.  you begin to feel the electricity that God would do to you what he did to Heidi what he did to Leif Hetland some others.  uh have you ever seen that?  no I haven't have you ever seen?  no I haven't.

You may begin to feel yourself bowed over, bent down by the glory of God and fire and electricity coming into your hands.  There's fire.  And so, Father, we just believe you're going to do it now.  So let's wait on him.  In Jesus' name, all over this place, God, release this sign to them that you are anointing them for an anointing for healing, that they're going to take it back to their churches and the places you're going to send them.  Now, in Jesus' name.  Now, in Jesus' name, release your electricity.  Release your fire.  Release your compassion.  God, that people begin to weep for the broken and the sick.  And it'd be your compassion.  Give it to them, Lord, in Jesus' name.  And I see some of you already, the power, God, it's like 110.  God, make it 220 in Jesus' name.  I pray some of you would feel like you're getting electrocuted.  And what God did to me in Lakeland in 1994, two weeks before Toronto, he do to you, fire would come into your hands and it would even hurt.  Fire, more, more electricity, electrocute him, God.
