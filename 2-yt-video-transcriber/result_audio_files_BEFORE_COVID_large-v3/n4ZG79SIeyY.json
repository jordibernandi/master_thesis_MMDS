            "text": "Watch.  I mean, you know, America's not unique in its sins.  as a country.  We're not unique in our evils, to be honest with you.  I think where we may be singular is our refusal to acknowledge them and the legends and myths we tell about our inherent goodness to hide and cover and conceal so that we can maintain a kind of willful ignorance that protects our innocence.  See, the thing is that when the Tea Party was happening, We were saying, pundits, oh, it's just about economic populism.  It's not about race.  When people knew, people knew, social scientists were already writing that what was driving the Tea Party were anxieties about demographic shifts, that the country was changing, that they were seeing these racially ambiguous babies on Cheerios commercials.  that the country wasn't quite feeling like it was a white nation anymore.  And people were screaming from the top of their lungs, yo, this is not just simply economic populism.  This is the ugly underbelly of the country.  See, the thing is, is this, and I'll say this and I'll take the hit on it.  There are communities that have had to bear the brunt of America confronting, white Americans confronting the danger of their innocence.  And it happens every generation.  So somehow we have to kind of, oh my God, is this who we are?  And just again, here's another generation of babies.  Think about it, that two-year-old had his bones broken by two parents trying to shield him from being killed.  A woman who has been married to this man for as long as I've been on the planet almost, lost her husband.  For what?  And so what we know is that the country has been playing politics for a long time on this hatred.  We know this.  So it's easy for us to place it all on Donald Trump's shoulders.  It's easy for us to place Pittsburgh on his shoulders.  It's easy for me to place Charlottesville on his shoulders.  It's easy for us to place El Paso on his shoulders.  This is us.  And if we're going to get past this, we can't blame it on him.  He's a manifestation of the ugliness that's in us.  I've had the privilege of growing up in a tradition that didn't believe in the myths and the legends because we had to bear the brunt of them.  Either we're going to change, Nicole, or we're going to do this again and again.  And babies are going to have to grow up without mothers and fathers, uncles and aunts, friends, while we're trying to convince white folk to finally leave behind a history that will maybe, maybe or embrace a history that might set them free from being white.

            "text": "Finally.  All right.  It's kind of hard to know how to follow this, to be quite honest with you.  Eddie Glaude kind of just lays it all out.  But here's the basis of it.  Demographics in America are changing.  And that scares people that are racist.  That's the bottom line here.  And I don't know... I don't know how that improves.  I don't know how to make racist people not racist.  I mean, that's what I struggle with.  Knowing that there are people that are white like me but don't have the same view on human life that I do.  They think that their lives are more valuable because they're white.  I don't know how to knock that out of somebody.  Because that is something that just seems like it's... It's brainwashing or it's bred within people when they are... I mean, it's not like.  it's innate to their... structure of like.  it's not in their dna but people grow up in these families in these households that think this way that are white supremacists and oftentimes they likely don't even realize it.  but they have these innate biases this innate racism that that is inside of them and they're not aware of it.  and when that racism takes hold in somebody who is you know on a certain edge of society A young white man who maybe is feeling isolated, you add that to the racism, you throw in some of these YouTube assholes that help to perpetuate that kind of hatred towards others, that kind of feeling of disconnectedness or awareness that the demographics in America are changing, and that for them that means it's a bad thing.  For them that's scary.  For... Most people, I think most people, there's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing scary about that.  People are people are people.  But for a lot of these white people, that's what it is.  They're innately scared of the other.  Because they're racist.  And they don't know how to deal with that.  Or they aren't even really aware of that.  That's just how they've been programmed.  By media, by family, by politicians.  Whatever it is.  And they've never had to actually process that and understand their emotions that way.  So, the result are oftentimes these sorts of mass shootings done by white supremacists.  Yeah.  I got nothing else to say here.  I think Eddie Glaude laid it out beautifully.  And... Again, I want to be able to offer some kind of like, you know, course of action.  I guess all I can really say is educate people in your lives.  I mean, there's no way to really address this without addressing it head on.  And that begins by discussing what the problem actually is. ",
