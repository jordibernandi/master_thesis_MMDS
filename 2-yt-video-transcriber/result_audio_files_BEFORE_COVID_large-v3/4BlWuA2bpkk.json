In other words, don't make a god to suit yourself, because from there issues all other crimes and sins against God.  If you say to yourself, God doesn't care, then you can do anything, like I said.  There's nothing right nor wrong.  That's why atheism is so... so embraced by this generation because it means they can do anything they want fornication lying stealing pornography whatever.  but if there is a God we're morally responsible and we deep in our heart know that via the conscience.  so God made provision for you to be forgiven.  He made a way for you to have everlasting life.  You and I broke God's law.  The Ten Commandments are called the moral law.  Jesus came and paid our fine.  When he was on the cross, he said something very strange.  Just before he died, he said, it is finished.  And that's a weird thing to say before you die.  But he was saying the debt has been paid.  If you're in court, someone pays you fine even though you're guilty.  the judge can legally let you go.  he can say angel's guilty but he's out of here.  someone's paid his fine.  next case well god can legally dismiss your case.  forgive your sins commute your death sentence.  let you live forever all because of that suffering death and resurrection of the savior.  what you have to do in response is repent and trust in him.  Repentance is a change of mind which issues in a change of life.  And that is you won't lie, steal, lust, fornicate, blaspheme, commit adultery.  You'll turn from those sins.  It's kind of like letting them go.  Like a rich man fell in the ocean and he had a belt around his waist that was filled with gold.  60 pounds of gold.  He wouldn't undo the belt and let it drop and he sunk to his death.  He drowned because he wouldn't let go.  And that's what sin will do to you.  It's got a delusive glamour.  Sin is like a flame to a moth.  We just love pornography and fornication and lying and stealing.  You know, before I was a Christian as a little kid, we used to raid orchards around our area, neighborhood.  We had a map.  I could get fruit off the bowl in the refrigerator, but it wasn't as exciting as stealing.  And that's because our hearts are wicked.  We love darkness and hate the light.  So, angel, if you'll repent and trust in Jesus like you trust a parachute, God will forgive every sin you've ever committed, all those secret sins, those sexual imaginations, those deeds done in darkness.  He'll wash you clean of them and remove them as far as the east is from the west.  it's a bible verse do you know?  you can find north and south.  you can go to the north pole and find it.  you can go to the south.  you can't find east or west.  there's no east there's no west.  god says the minute you repent and trust in christ your sins will be removed in infinite distance so that god will never judge you for them and you'll get to live forever with a new body not floating on a cloud playing a rusty heart but a brand new body that'll never age and you'll never die on no suffering disease pain or death.  the other thing i'm telling the truth Yeah.  I see you're nodding.  Have you had a Christian background? ",

So he went to a far country to get away from his dad.  He visited prostitutes, spent all his money.  A famine came on the land, and he found himself feeding pigs.  That's the only job he could get.  And as he looked at the pig food, he desired to eat it.  He was that hungry, and that's what brought him to a census.  and he went back.  he says father forgive me you know i've sinned against god and i've sinned against you and his father embraced him.  now the revelation you need to have is that your desires are for filthy pig food unclean sexual imaginations and things like that.  when you get that when that revelation comes to you you'll say boy i don't want to end up in hell and when you go to god he'll meet you halfway and fall upon you and kiss you and embrace you like the prodigal's father did to his son and you'll find everlasting life.  So if you believe this is true, you need to get before the Lord and repent and trust in Christ.  Do you know how to do that? ",
