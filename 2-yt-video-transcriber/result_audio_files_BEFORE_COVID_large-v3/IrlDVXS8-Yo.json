And my dating life, it's kind of, I do not have it basically because I have a job, I do yoga, and I do not have a lot of time, just clubbing somewhere, go out, night out and stuff.  And, yeah, something like that.  And, you know, day... How do you call it?  Day game?  Yeah, day game is pretty tough, I guess, because, you know, I think I'm out of practice for a long year.  Because, I mean, I spend a lot of time in Asia, and the way how you live there is way different.  So, yeah, I'm out of practice.  I guess that's a huge problem.  And, of course, I'm really struggling about my English. ",

            "text": "Well, your English isn't that bad.  Much bigger problem, it's your face.  I'm just kidding.  Your face is fine.  You look good.  I had to do that.  Come on, it was an obvious joke.  Well, you said it yourself.  It's practice.  You're out of practice.  But when you're really moved in your heart to go and meet a woman, you're going to do it.  But only if you're rooted in yourself, if you're rooted in who you are.  So what you need to practice is being more comfortable with yourself.  That's actually the practice.  It's not.  you need to practice meeting more women.  You need to practice being more comfortable being who you are.  Because who you are.  as a man, I know, deep down who you are, you're a loving being.  You're eternal.  You're the same consciousness that fuels me and all other life on the planet.  You're love.  And so in your divine state, when you're not being a person with problems and issues and insecurities, when you're just in your heart space, right?  and you see a beautiful moment, what would you do?  You'd walk up to her and say, you are so beautiful.  Oh my God, what's your name?  You wouldn't even think about doing this.  It's the person with the thoughts of like, oh, is this weird?  Maybe she's married.  Maybe she'll call the police.  Maybe she'll say I'm a sexual predator.  Maybe she'll kick me in the balls.  That's not God.  That's not love.  That's the person.  So the question is, what practices can you do in your life that will lead you to become this being, this heart-centered being that will identify more with being that loving presence that will act and do whatever is in the moment that feels right rather than this person?  that has these doubts.  What are you doing in your life to get to that place? ",

It's going to blow your fucking reality and you won't know it until you do it.  It doesn't matter what you're doing.  The intention, why you're doing it, changes everything.  When you meditate, set an intention to know God.  It's great that you're doing yoga, and it's great that you're doing meditation, but what about having an intention, an intention to connect with the divine?  What about the intention to become the absolute highest version of yourself that is fully loving and fully present and fully healed and fully able to communicate and be authentic with anyone you meet in the world from a place of love, including the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, without any hesitation, because you are divine love.  You are that grace at all moments.  What about that intention? ",

Rather than trying to not think when you meditate, Make the intention to connect with the divine, but focus your attention on opening your heart.  So you literally imagine opening your heart.  It's good to put your hand here also.  Open your heart and send love out to the divine and ask and put out the intention.  Not only do I want to connect with the divine, but I'm open to the divine.  I want to hear what the divine has to say.  I'm listening.  Just be present in your heart and say, I am listening, universe, and the universe will speak to you. ",

But one more thing you can start doing, which I've been teaching for years, do things every day that make you a little bit uncomfortable.  You must destroy the part of your ego that is worried about rejection or what people think.  So just stare at a window.  If there's a woman on her iPhone on a subway, look at it.  If she looks at you, look away.  And after a few moments, look again, she looks at you, look away.  There's things that people will look at you and be like, what the fuck's wrong with this guy?  Just do silly shit where people are like, what the fuck?  Because you'll realize actually that nothing bad happens.  It doesn't matter what people think.  And it's just your ego creating stories that, oh, it'll be wrong if I, no.  So challenge yourself socially every day, just a little bit.  Do one thing every day.  that's a little bit uncomfortable.  It could just be yelling, free hot dogs!  Just kidding, there's no free hot dogs.  It could just be that.  That's it.  Thank you. ",
