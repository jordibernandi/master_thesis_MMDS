            "text": "Okay guys, we got Mesa PD again at my favorite place, the Miles Motel.  5230, unit number.  We got some lady that's hollering at somebody.  And we got the same lady that was at the other one.  This lady was hollering at people.  She just said, fuck me.  Since she was at the deck box.  I guess she's a little loony.  Maybe they'll take her in this time.  Get her some help.  See if they search her.  What the fuck you looking at?  What the fuck you looking at?  You looked at me like you were gay or something.  Since he was hollering at these ladies up here.  Fuck, a cop came up behind me.  Once again, Betsy, I didn't see him.  He walked right up beside me and looked at me like, what the hell are you doing?  He must have came in another car.  Once again, keep my head on this level.  He walked so close to me I could smell his breath.  Something about.  he was using a coat collar on a dog.  There's some dog shit here.  It's only 95 today guys.  Oh, fuck!  Goddamn!  Got to get out of the street.  Get out of the street, man.  Shut the fuck up.  I'm giving you room.  Don't you put your fucking hands on me.  Stay out of the street.  Don't you put your fucking hands on me.  I was giving you room to get by.  That's illegal.  Get the fuck out of my face.  That's illegal, all right?  Don't fucking talk to him that way.  Let's go.  What's your badge number?  Badge number 16729.  16702.  Now get the fuck out of my face.  Stay out of the street and we don't have to give you tickets.  Alright?  Have a good day.  You're going to get a complaint for putting your hands on me.  You don't touch a citizen.  I'm here for your protection.  You never know what these guys will do.  You know how many times they've shot people?  This was over with.  Hey, when they talk to me, I can talk to them.  That's the law.  That's the law.  I know the law.  I'm in a public sidewalk.  Do that.  I'd love to see that.  This prick over there put his fucking hands on me.  He's gonna get a complaint.  Yes, because Charlie has them.  Charlie has them.  I beat Charlie before going in.  He has pellets, yeah?  These legs are fucking his.  This shit's mine.  That's the insight.  Don't take pictures while they file it up.  Got a damn fly messing around with me guys.  They say flies hang around shit.  I guess they're gonna make her move along.  At least they're nice enough to help her load her stuff up.  Throw that here.  Hey, hey, hey, we're not going to do that.  You're not going to say anything.  Jesse's got a dog.  It's windy out here, guys. ",
