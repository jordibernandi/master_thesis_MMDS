            "text": "Hi everyone.  Yeah, I know it has been a long time.  I have been busy with work.  Then I've been on vacation.  And I needed a break from YouTube because the stupid... Just sometimes just... It's too much.  There's too much I need to address.  that makes me want to facepalm so hard my head flies off.  And... I just... lose the spark you know but hopefully I'm back for a while now.  today I want to talk about something I shared on Facebook while I was out of town.  it's a little image that looks like this And yeah, as you can see, it's from the Trinity Foundation.  And that's a bunch of presuppositionalists.  If that wasn't obvious.  So let's address this.  Science is always false.  observation is unreliable.  Absolutely correct.  Or, well, I should say, no observation is absolutely reliable.  This is something that is actually known in science, something that is accepted, and that's why there are so many controls used, and that's why so much evidence is required, because any single observation is unreliable.  But if you have a thousand observations that all show the same thing, the probability that they are all wrong in the same way It's pretty slim, right?  But it's possible.  But in order to reach the conclusion that science is always false, which is what these guys are saying, You can't just say that observation is unreliable.  You must say that observation is so unreliable that it's at least more often than not completely wrong.  It is a useless way of acquiring information.  You can't even say that, hey, this is what I observe, so I know the truth is something else.  It's not that the clock has stopped and is therefore right twice a day.  It's the clock is showing random numbers.  That's what you'd have to say.  And if you're going to say that, then you lose any ability to say anything about reality.  So that bites you in the foot as well.  2.  All scientific experiments commit the fallacy of asserting the consequent.  I haven't actually heard of that name.  It could be that the fallacy has several names that I'm not aware of, but I think you mean affirming the consequent.  So for those who don't know what that is, the fallacy they're referring to here is if this hypothesis is correct, then this experiment will have this outcome.  Oh look, the experiment had that outcome, therefore the hypothesis is correct.  That is a fallacy.  If A then B. B, therefore A. No, you can't do that.  You can actually... If you have if A then B, then it's possible to have B without A. All you know is that A implies B. But maybe there's something else that will also give you B. So it is possible that if this hypothesis is correct, then this experiment will have this outcome.  Yes, sure.  But it could also be that the hypothesis is wrong and there's something else that gives you the same result.  So it only appears that the hypothesis is correct.  That is absolutely true.  to say that this is a fallacy.  however in science we never say if this hypothesis is correct then this experiment will have this outcome.  the experiment had this outcome.  therefore we have proven the hypothesis to be true.  what we say is This hypothesis makes this prediction.  We test that prediction.  Okay.  It held up.  Okay.  Therefore, we have reason to believe that the hypothesis is true.  It has been tested.  It could have been falsified, but it survived the attempt to falsify it.  We now have evidence in support of it.  We cannot say that we have proven it to be true with any sort of absolute certainty.  So we don't.  We don't.  This is a straw man.  We don't say that.  Three, science commits the fallacy of induction, hasty generalization.  The fallacy being referred to here is, hey, let's try this experiment.  Okay, we got this outcome.  Okay, cool.  Let's try it again.  Oh, we got the same result.  Cool.  And again, same result.  And again, same result.  We tried this ten times, and every time it appears that we are right.  So we conclude that we are right.  Well, we've tried it so many times now that, you know, hey, what about the next time?  Maybe the next experiment will show that we're wrong.  It's absolutely correct, and we're aware of that.  Which is why, once again, we don't claim to prove things.  Not in the epistemic sense, you know, proving things like you prove a mathematical theorem.  In science, the only kind of proof we have is the preponderance of the evidence.  If we've tried something a million times and every time it gives you the same result, I think it's pretty fair to assume that we're going to get the same result the next time as well.  And we can't prove that.  But it seems reasonable.  So, I think we are justified in tentatively accepting the hypothesis as truth.  And when we can prove otherwise, When that experiment happens that has this completely contradictory outcome, then we will go back and change our minds or update the hypothesis.  Hey, it looks like it's this way except in this situation.  Hmm, why is that?  Let's see if we can generalize it and see why it turns out differently.  That's how science advances.  But we don't wait for the absolute, ultimate, perfect theory before we start using science.  If we did that, we'd still be living in caves.  Four.  Equations are always selected.  They are never discovered.  Wow.  Gotta give credit to presuppers here.  They seem to be... better at math than most apologists.  Mathematics is something we invent.  We only discover it in the sense that we discover potential consequences of something.  We don't find them under rocks somewhere.  That's absolutely true.  But it's also completely irrelevant because equations are not evidence.  Equations are tools that we use to formulate hypotheses.  We make predictions using them.  But they are not part of the testing process.  They are what we use to make the prediction.  that then needs to be tested.  And when we have tested it, enough times that we are justified in saying, yeah, this does seem to be something that we can accept tentatively, then we do.  And then we use those equations because they have so far been successful.  What's the problem?  Five, all scientific laws describe ideal situations.  Yes, but no situation in reality is described by just one scientific law.  So the fact that you assume no air resistance, for example, in a certain situation, that's one thing.  Then you have another law that handles how air resistance is dealt with.  And in a real situation, when you want to make a prediction about the behavior of the real world, you have to combine those two.  What's the problem?  How does this lead to the conclusion that science is always false?  Do you understand what you mean, Trinity Foundation?  Because I don't think you do.  See ya. ",
