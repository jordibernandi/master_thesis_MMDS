At the intersection of Albany and Converse, element passenger on a silver Kia.  Ma'am.  Now I'm in fear of where I'm going.  Lincoln 737, Lincoln 740, this is 43 only.  That 17 called back and was trying to cancel.  How did I do that?  I'll just be able to get you.  But she couldn't tell how he left.  Okay.  Ma'am, I'm just going to do it.  I won't fall over if I don't want to.  Wow.  You're going back to your car, sir.  Why?  Can you tell me why?  Clearly, you're not being arrested anymore.  For what?  Please stop talking to me, okay?  What did I do?  That'd be great if you could just stop talking.  Since I don't trust anything the officer says, I'm just going to go with the flow.  Whatever happens to me on this ride happens.  Yeah, keep saying everything so you can be here and don't bite the camera.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.  I'm scared right now.  I'm in County Jail.  Sure.  And I'm on South Grand and 11th Street.  Yes, you are.  And you're not talking to me.  Going south.  I don't, how about?  I don't want to communicate with you, sir?  Officer Blair, because you think it's a... Officer Blair, really?  Oh, is that a threat?  Are you threatening me?  Is that what it is?  No, you said, I'm gonna, yeah, you said, I'm gonna see you.  Okay, basically you said you threatened God.  Oh, are you a police officer?  Are you a lawyer?  Oh, I didn't know.  It sounded like you were, so please stop talking.  I didn't agree to talk to you.  I'm scared to say I used to be the one preaching to you That you could overcome.  I don't believe it.  It ain't easy.  That world I paint.  Where things just don't work out.  It started changing.  And it got me so down.  You're doing way too much.  You're doing too much.  You're ridiculous.  My God, can I get this dude on my car now?  He's highly annoying.  Is that the only reason?  I always call a traffic stop, too.  I don't know what I was thinking.  My God.  Go ahead, hop out.  Am I stepping out?  Like I just told you.  Sure.  I know you don't care.  Didn't know?  you were a doctor, too.  A lawyer, a police officer, and a doctor.  No, I just feel pain.  I feel pain like you. ",
