            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to Moon Ride, where we're channeling the man in the moon.  I just want to mention three things before I do a little video on what Trump's going to do next.  The first thing, and maybe the most important thing, is just to note.  in my last video, some people said it was kind of scary to watch.  I had to think over whether I would put that video out there or not, but I decided that it was very important to put that out there.  Look, there are dark forces out there, and they really are evil.  They won't win, but they certainly can mess up the truth a lot.  That evil looks like Jeffrey Epstein and the people who facilitate Jeffrey Epstein.  And those people are very much in touch with dark forces.  So I just want to let you know, whenever you're doing this work, Be very careful of what you're channeling.  And don't hesitate to say, no, you are not welcome here.  You need to leave if you are doing it.  It should feel good in your heart, not neutral in your heart.  It should feel good, like a positive force.  Anything else, forget it.  Tell it to leave, sage off.  And it's okay to get angry and yell and tell them to go away, right?  Ask your facilitators, whatever they may be, to help you.  The second thing that I think is important to mention is have you been feeling kind of weird, kind of off, not sure what direction you're going to go in for the past two weeks?  I sure have.  And I really believe that something is happening in the universe.  Something's being transformed.  We're being changed.  They say that the Earth is moving into a new phase, a phase a little bit more like love.  The third thing is, look, Trump's losing.  There's no way in heck he is going to become the president at this point.  Every time he opens his mouth, it becomes pretty clear that he is suffering from Alzheimer's.  He has become a liability for the Republican party.  and as i said many years ago it looks like they're going to be the ones that remove him.  notice pelosi was right.  the best thing that we could do was do some investigations and let trump make a fool of himself which he has done over and over again.  right.  notice the changing voice of the republican party which does not give him any support.  believe me all those guys behind those closed doors.  they are talking about how to get rid of them because it looks like we will now win the senate perhaps definitely the house and certainly the presidency.  it's possible that democrats will win all three portions of the government and will have a mandate to actually do something now since Trump has been in power in the way that he has.  So maybe the best thing to do right now in this video, even though it's clear Trump is going down, and I would ask you all to repeat this to yourself because it will calm you down.  We have gotten past the most difficult part.  The battle is not over, but we've certainly gone past the battle of the bulge, right?  So I do want to see what he is going to do next, just so that we're a little bit prepared for the steps along the way as we watch this decline.  All right.  Spirit, what can people know about the Trump administration?  What can they know in advance so that they will not be too shocked?  Okay, it's a pretty deep trance here, guys.  As you notice, I'm having trouble speaking.  Okay, I am seeing Trump.  So I'm seeing Trump walk on a stage.  He's trying to have some kind of debate.  And he, again, looks so feeble.  He doesn't quite know where he is.  He's making such a fool out of himself that everybody in the audience is sort of aghast.  Even his attempts to insult people kind of become slurred and make a fool out of him.  You can expect panic.  The Republicans are going to panic.  And the press is going to have a field day with Trump's gaffes.  It's almost like the Democratic opponents feel sorry for him.  He is so pathetic.  This will happen fairly soon.  I'm getting within the next couple of months that we will see him on stage doing something like this.  It may just be a press conference.  But to me, it looks like a big stage, almost like a debate.  But I don't think it is literally a debate.  Some things, I see the southern border.  And the southern border sort of bursts open.  Something happens, like there's a flood of people.  And it's not people, though.  It's just something strange happens.  Something goes down with the southern border where there's like a breakthrough moment or it literally looks like a border that's gone like... Yeah, and actually, it appears as water, so I wonder if this is some kind of environmental phenomenon.  But I'm not thinking that now.  It looks like people, that's what Spirit is saying, is some kind of people.  And now I'm seeing sort of Mexico and Latin America.  I wonder if things aren't going to get so much worse there that there's an even greater movement of refugees.  Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of political despots in South America.  Bolsonaro.  He's not looking very steady.  I do see those forests, those jungles burning.  And Bolsonaro is also looking more and more desperate.  The smoke seems to fill even the air where he's speaking to a crowd.  And they're becoming angrier and angrier at him.  Hmm.  So Spirit, again, what do people need to know?  What will help them?  What's some events that they need to know?  I'm seeing a hurricane.  I don't know if it's the present one, but what I see in this hurricane is completely wet shores of Florida.  Yeah, it seems really quite devastating in the sense of the beach changes.  It's not the same beach like we don't have.  The coast of Florida is not the same.  It's narrower.  Yeah, I do see that Florida is getting blasted.  It's just high water.  That corresponds with the news.  You're just getting a lot of high water.  And along the coast, the east coast, southern east coast of the United States, we're getting a lot of high water.  This will be devastating for Trump because he does not have the skills to handle it.  It's one of those things where he has to fly down there and speak publicly and his managers. ",
