            "text": "I'm sad to announce that women have been eliminated.  Yes, all women, even me.  Cause of death, menstrual pad marketing decisions.  Goodbye, cruel world.  This news comes to us courtesy of Julie Bindle, an apparently prominent feminist in the UK.  And you know what that means.  There's at least an 80% chance that she hates trans people.  Because TERFhood is like a fucking bacterial infection over there.  It's like as if Andrew Wakefield had once done a study that's since been retracted that said that transgenderism causes autism, and all of the feminists in the UK just believed it, and now we have to deal with this.  It's, honestly, it's exhausting.  Sure enough, Bindel, so named for the handkerchief on a stick that hobos use to carry their harmonicas around in, is quite upset about trans people, particularly, she writes in the Telegraph, that trans people have influenced always the maker of female sanitary products, into removing the Venus symbol from their packaging.  Always has also pledged to write on each package that there's no such thing as a woman anymore and that biological sex is a lie.  Oh, sorry, no, actually not those last two things, just the first one.  They're literally just removing the Venus symbol from their packages.  I was really confused by this because here in America, the Always package doesn't seem to have a Venus symbol on it.  It's pretty plain, like there's the logo, there's a nice color, there's an innocuous pattern in the background.  And the pads themselves have always just been wrapped in plain or pastel colored paper.  that used to sound like a jet engine when I was in high school and had to unwrap one in the stall while my friends snickered outside by the sinks, but no Venus symbol.  I'll be honest, the only photo I had was this one showing a Venus symbol on the throwaway wrapper around the pad, and I could not believe that that was all there was to it.  This symbol must be super prominent on the UK's packaging or else this would just not be that big of a deal.  So I had to look elsewhere to see what other outlets were covering this.  And I found that the Daily Fail, because only horrible rags seem to think this is a big deal, had a video in which they write, always add that features old logo before the Venus symbol is removed.  So let's watch that.  I have watched this ad nine times and I still have no idea where the symbol is.  Over on the Metro, because again, rags, they have two photos.  One of the exterior packaging, which again, I cannot tell has any Venus symbol.  And the other is that singular piece of trash with one Venus symbol on it.  So I guess that's it.  That's what the Terps are upset about.  Literally a disposable wrapper with the Venus symbol.  Again, this is by no means a common pad design.  All of the ones I've ever used have been yellow or green or blue, maybe with a subtle texture to it.  And I can't believe that for all this time, like 24, 25 years, I've been using a product that made me less of a woman because it didn't have the Venus symbol on it.  Ah, tragedy.  For real, this symbol isn't like a beloved logo for something that's been around for decades that's suddenly being torn away.  Like, oh no, my mother used the always pads with the Venus symbol on them and her mother before her and her mother before her throughout my family's many generations.  How dare you remove this beloved heirloom from us?  No, it's just a pattern on a fucking disposable menstrual pad that probably hasn't even been in use for very long.  You insane TERFs.  Here's something that I guess makes me a little different from Bindle and the other TERFs who are clutching their pearls.  I don't actually need a product to be coded with what society has determined to be female.  in order for me to purchase and use it.  I don't need for my disposable pens to be for her.  I don't need my earplugs to be pink, or for my beer to be for chicks, or for my microscope to be... You know, actually, that's kind of cute.  I would buy that.  But it used to be that when hardcore feminists like myself saw these types of things, we'd point out that it's actually pandering and only serves to reinforce tired stereotypes about women.  Hell, Gillette put out a razor and they called it the Venus.  And the whole point of it was that you don't need to use shaving cream anymore.  And I thought it was the grossest thing ever because the commercials implied that women were too stupid to use shaving cream.  And suddenly this razor is supposed to empower us.  It was insulting, but then I used it and actually I kind of liked it and I stopped using shaving cream altogether.  But that's because hair conditioner is better and cheaper anyway.  But my point stands.  You can't just brand something as feminine and sell it to me without me being annoyed that you are commercializing a stereotype about me.  And you also can't brand something as feminist without annoying me because you're belittling and cheapening my own deeply held beliefs about ethics and human rights.  Bindel is not like me.  So she whines that trans activists have made wholly unreasonable requests that companies immediately capitulate to.  But is that true?  Is it unreasonable to politely suggest that they drop a symbol that only refers to one sex?  when many trans men require products to deal with their menstruation?  And was P&G, Procter & Gamble's capitulation immediate?  Or as a large company, were they already planning to update their packaging as they do constantly, swapping out designs and refreshing colors and patterns with new seasons?  And have they been thinking for a while now how the younger generation of consumers are more interested in buying gender neutral products?  Because I'm sorry, Pindle, but you're not the target market for these menstrual pads.  Because Procter & Gamble aren't the only company to notice this.  Thinx are truly amazing panties, underwear, underwear, that prevent periods from leaking.  And when they first started, they did use gendered language.  And trans men pointed out that they would love to use these products.  So Thinx started selling more unisex designs and using non-gendered language.  And maybe somewhere a TERF suddenly felt like less of a woman.  But me, as a cis woman who uses these products, I felt absolutely fine.  It didn't hurt me in the least that... non-gendered language was suddenly being used to sell this product.  And somewhere a trans man did feel more comfortable buying a product like this.  that would substantially improve his life.  And so it's a win-win.  Pretty much everybody is happier, except for that one TERF somewhere for some reason.  So yeah, it's nuts to me that a company can change the pattern on a disposable menstrual pad and Julie Bindle loses her fucking mind saying that they are, and I quote, eliminating any mention of the female sex.  Like the next time I go to buy tampons, it's going to look like some sort of classified document with blacked out boxes all over where female used to be.  Only for women.  Like, it never said that.  It doesn't matter.  You know what a tampon's for.  Bindle also takes time in her important screed to complain that terms such as pregnant women and breastfeeding are now transphobic.  That one caught me off guard, so I looked into it and it turns out that Bindle is a fucking moron.  I'm sorry, a fucking moron woman.  Referring to pregnant women is only transphobic if a group of pregnant people are standing in front of you and that group includes at least one trans man.  If you use the term to refer to all pregnant people as a whole, it's mostly just a little wrong.  If you do that to generalize while talking about women's issues, then that's probably not a big deal.  If you do it to specifically exclude pregnant men, then yeah, that is definitely transphobic.  Why are you doing that?  Breastfeeding is not in any way transphobic, and no serious person would believe that.  It may be a word that some people don't like.  Everyone has breasts.  Men, women.  Everyone.  But breasts have been coded by our society to be female and sexual, which is why some men may be embarrassed to contract breast cancer.  Maybe some men with breast cancer would prefer to call it something else.  In the same way, maybe some men and women might prefer to not use a word that is coded as both female and sexual when nursing their children, which, by the way, both cis sexes can do.  So they say nursing or chest feeding.  If you ask someone if they're breastfeeding, no one is going to call you transphobic.  They are probably too busy wondering why the fuck you think it's any of your business how they're feeding their children.  Like if they are a close friend and it comes up in conversation, that's great.  But at that point, you probably know whether or not they have a problem with the word breast.  After recently losing a war over whether or not a nice theater would put in some bathrooms that make everyone feel welcomed, British Terps have officially run out of problems.  Best of luck to Bindle and her trans-hating friends in this very trying time when they are subjected to the absolute inhumanity of purchasing menstrual pads that are not printed with a pattern they find sufficiently celebratory of their femininity.  I'm so sorry for your loss. ",
