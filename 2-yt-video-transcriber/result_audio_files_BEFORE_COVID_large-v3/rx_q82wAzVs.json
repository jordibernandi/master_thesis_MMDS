            "text": "Feeling great because the lights on me Celebrating the things that everyone told me Would never happen but God has put his hands on me And ain't a man alive who'd ever take it from me.  Good evening Iowa!  So we all know why we're here.  We're here because this is a moment, this is a moment where we have to be prepared to fight for the best of our country.  This is a moment where we need to fight for this country we love, for the rule of law, for our system of justice, and for our very democracy.  So we're all here to fight.  We're all here to fight.  We're all here to fight to end that national nightmare called Donald Trump.  And to win, Democrats, to win.  It can't be about anything other than looking at the future.  It can't be about looking at yesterday.  We need to be focused on tomorrow.  To win, we're going to have to fight against those who have been trying to push hate and division among us and have Americans turn on each other.  To win, we are going to have to fight for what I know in my heart and in my soul to be true, which is in the beauty of the diversity of who we are as a nation.  We all, we all have so much more in common than what separates us.  And to win, and to win, and to win, We're gonna need a nominee on that stage with Donald Trump who has the ability to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump in Iowa.  You're looking at her.  So I've spent my career I've spent my career as a prosecutor.  I've only had one client in my entire life, and that's been the people.  Unlike other people, unlike others, I've never represented a corporation.  I've never represented a special interest.  And I started my career fighting for the people.  In fact, the first day I walked into a courtroom, I spoke five words.  Kamala Harris for the people.  And those words, those words for the people, Capture our system of justice.  because there are two points when we say for the people.  One, in our system of justice we have rightly said a harm against anyone is a harm against everyone.  That no one should ever be made to fight alone.  And for the people, when I stood there and when I stand here today, also means all the people, regardless of race, regardless of gender, regardless of sexual orientation, regardless of the party with which they're registered to vote, regardless of the language your grandmother speaks.  It means all the people.  And it was for the people that a large part of the early part of my career was about fighting against those who molested children and raped women because it was about saying that those survivors deserved justice and a voice that gave them safety without judgment.  For the people, when I was the elected District Attorney of San Francisco, saying that that war on drugs was an abject failure and so I created national models about what it means to give jobs to people who are arrested for drugs.  For the people, When I was the Attorney General of California running the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, meant taking on the biggest banks in the United States who had engaged in predatory lending practices and bringing back to the homeowners of my state $20 billion.  And for the people, as a United States Senator, meant taking on Jeff Sessions.  Taking on Bill Barr.  Taking on Brett Kavanaugh.  And I stand here before you today for the people fully prepared to defeat Donald Trump.  And that's why I'm running for the people.  And I will say that in the name of the people, I believe that in 2020, justice is on the ballot.  Justice is on the ballot.  When in America there is a father who is holding down two jobs, trying to figure out how to get through the end of the month, and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America, economic justice is on the ballot.  So I'm running for president to pass the largest middle class tax cut we have had in history.  And you want to know how we're going to pay for it?  On day one, we're going to repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America.  When in America, there is a mother who is in a parking lot of a hospital, afraid to walk through the sliding glass doors to get into the emergency room with her child because she knows if she walks through those sliding glass doors, she'll be out of pocket, a $4,000 deductible.  Healthcare justice is on the ballot.  So I am running for president.  to make sure there is Medicare for all, not Medicare for some, Medicare for all.  to bring down costs and to ensure that you also get choice because I heard from folks that said, Kamala, don't take away my opportunity to have a private plan.  so you'll get a public or private plan depending on your choice.  When we are looking, at teachers who across America and here in Iowa are holding down two and three jobs to get through the end of the month.  Education justice is on the ballot.  So I am running for president to put in place what will be the first in our nation's history federal investment in closing the teacher pay gap here in Iowa.  That'll be $12,200 a year.  When all over America there are women who are being attacked for their constitutional right to make decisions about their own bodies, reproductive justice is on the ballot.  So I am running to ensure every woman will have her legal and constitutional right and that not these out-of-date Republican legislators tell women what to do with their bodies.  When children in America, regardless of who their parent voted for for president, are afraid to go to school because they are afraid they may get shot, they are afraid there will be a gunman roaming the hallways of their school, justice for children is on the ballot.  So I am running for president to take executive action if necessary and implement what people who have failed to have courage have not done, which is take on the gun lobby in Washington, D.C And I want to give a shout out to Beto because he had the courage.  Beto had the courage to say, look, you can't walk around talking about gun safety, but you don't have the courage to figure out how you're going to take 5 million assault weapons off the streets of America.  Justice is on the ballot.  So it is time that we fight.  And this is a fight that is about all of us.  Because yes, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.  And here's the bottom line, Iowa.  Here's the bottom line.  I do believe, I do believe that when we overcome these injustices, We will unlock the promise of America and the potential of the American people.  And I do believe, I do believe That this is what we want and need.  And this is the America.  That is the America that I see.  That is the America I believe in.  That is the America I know us to be.  And that is why I'm running for President of the United States.  Please join me and caucus with me in Kamala's corner.  Thank you.  Thank you.  For so many girls, I hear you've been running from the beautiful queen that you can be becoming.  I've been looking upon and see the storm coming.  Read the book of my life and see it overcoming.  Just because the length of your hair will rain down, and they often criticize you for your skin tone.  Wanna hold your head high, cause you're a pretty woman.  Catch a runway, strike a bone, and keep it going.  Don't let your mind just fall.  Thank you. ",
