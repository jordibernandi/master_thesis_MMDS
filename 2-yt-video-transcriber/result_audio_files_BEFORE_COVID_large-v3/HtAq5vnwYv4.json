Doing this interview.  Yeah, Fox News, right?  So you already know how the interview is going to be skewed, right?  So you kind of accept that going forward um but andrew really just like he nails every question he really commands the audience and he gets a stand.  it gets not a standing ovation but a huge applause at the end.  this is you know um a lefty who supports or is you know pushing ubi?  um is on fox news.  That's bold, and he's definitely not afraid.  Before we roll the clip, I just want you to pay close attention to this guy right here.  I can't remember his name.  They'll probably have it on screen, but whatever.  Just pay close attention to him.  Andrew Yang almost wins them all over, and this guy remembers, wait, we're Fox News.  The talking points, right?
