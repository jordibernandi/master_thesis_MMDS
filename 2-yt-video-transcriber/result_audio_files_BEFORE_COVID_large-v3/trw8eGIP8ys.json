            "text": "You don't get beyond it.  What you do is absorb it.  That's the compensatory way.  That's why I call it the compensatory counter-racist code.  See, I wrestle with that, okay?  And then I say, oh, it was right there all the time, but just like a lot of things, you don't see it.  It's right there on the surface.  You don't resist that.  You don't push it away from you.  You pull it to you.  You say, just like I say, Hey, don't cut Neely Fuller no slack.  See, when people say, Neely Fuller, I don't agree with you.  I said, you are doing exactly what you are supposed to do.  Don't agree with me.  Now, that leaves a vacuum.  What do you agree with?  You say, well, I agree with myself.  I say, all right.  By agreeing with yourself, you didn't agree with the statement that I made.  What is your statement?  See?  That's what you call that absorption.  See, I mean, that's not a trick.  That's scientific.  Okay, if I reject, if there are ten things to choose from, and I reject nine of them, what does that leave me if there are only ten?  That leaves me number ten.  It ain't nowhere else to go but the number ten.  That's all that the code is supposed to do.  When this subject comes up about black people getting together, no, you don't try to get black people together.  You try to point black people toward what?  One word, the truth.  And say, now wrestle with it individually, yourself.  What do you do about that truth that you are facing alone since you have painted yourself in that corner?  All right.  You say you got all the answers.  Okay.  This is answer time.  All right?  Okay, you're getting pulled over now.  You say you don't want to follow what you call Neely Fuller's formula, which is really not Neely Fuller's formula.  It's the formula of the universe.  I'm trying to get people to look into the laws of the universe.  It's all around you.  The universe teaches you cause and effect, just like it taught me.  I was hard-headed.  Talking about, you know, I'm the universe.  I'm not the universe.  I better go along with the laws of the universe.  I'm kaput.  I'm through.  I'm finished.  But, see, black people, you know, we think we got some mysterious formula coming out of nowhere.  I mean, you know, that just all about us and, you know, and all the people.  And it's understandable because we have seen so many things fail.  So we just assume that everything is a failure.  Well, the universe fails.  It hasn't failed, all right?  So if you tap into the laws of the universe, you got it all, regardless of what Neely Fuller or anybody else says, because Neely Fuller had better tap into it, or he's in bigger trouble than he's already in now.  So let's just give the illustration.  There are people who have said, no, I can't be giving over to the man, you know, when he comes around.  When he pulls me over, I mean, you know, I ain't going to do that stuff that you say do, because I just made suggestions.  I said three things.  I'm just giving one illustration.  Because most black people don't pay any attention to it.  Why?  Neely Fuller's saying it.  That's why.  If somebody else says it, if a white person says it, now they'll pay some attention to it.  But I understand that.  Why?  Because that's one of the effects of white supremacy.  A white person can come along and say the same thing.  Neely Fuller's been saying.  And some of them have done it.  All right?  And, man, they get attention right quick.  And I understand that.  And that's okay with me, because it really won't work for white supremacy if they're saying the same thing.  I'm saying.  All right?  It took some years for some white people to start using the term white supremacy.  And people were telling me, well, you know, you're using this term white supremacy.  Ain't nobody doing that but you.  I said, I'm going to keep at it, because that's the formula.  And that's the truth.  See what I mean?  It's not just a formula that I dreamed up.  It's the truth.  So now you have white people doing it, some white people, not most, but they'll use that term now in 2018.  But I originally got it from them, okay, but they stopped using it.  And they started going around saying white supremacy doesn't exist.  And then black people, particularly a lot of intellectuals, picked that up and started saying, yeah, you know, why?  Because Professor so-and-so who is white said so.  Because that's where he gets his authorization from professor so-and-so.  Now, black professors, if you notice, a lot of them argue with each other.  But when a white person speaks, even if that white person ain't a professor, they kind of sit up and even if they don't say nothing, they take notice.  They pay attention.  But it's logical that they would.  Because that's white supremacy at work.  Because the white supremacists are the most successful people on the planet.  All right?  In recorded history, in all of recorded history.  So in answer to, well, now, got to watch Neely Fuller, too.  See, I got away from the question.  That's a slogan.  See, we got all kinds of slogans.  We don't have a code.  You know, Black Lives Matter.  Well, Black Lives Matter to who?  To whom?  Black Lives Matter to people that don't matter.  According to the evidence, that's why we keep getting pulled over and we keep going according to the ghetto code, which is a failure.  I want to say that.  Not only ghetto failure, culture is a failure.  Black culture, what we call genuine, you know, the real thing, black culture is a failure so far.  Why?  Because it hasn't solved problems.  That's why.  We shouldn't just put a label on something and say, now we got it.  We got it all now.  I mean, you know, and then add a footnote up under that box.  We just put everything in and say, what?  But we got a long way to go.  Well, if you've got a long way to go, it means your culture is failing until you have done it all.  And you better get there quick and stop passing it on from generation to generation.  So getting to this black culture, black people getting together thing.  No, you don't get together with black people.  You don't do that.  Black people standing shoulder to shoulder looking up at a balcony somewhere.  I mean, whomever's supposed to be up there that they're making a protest to or whatnot.  That is really not power.  Power is when you have a code.  The white supremacists understand that.  That's why just one or two white supremacists can show up anywhere on the planet.  And with the white code, that's all they came with.  And what is a code?  Things that you do, things that you don't do.  Things that you say, things that you don't say.  That's all.  a code is when it comes to people.  You have fire codes, electrical codes, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  But anything that works is a code.  if it works, meaning when you do it, it's going to work.  Like I told people a part of the code, as an illustration, I started to say this a while ago, have three Fs.  Adopt that as your code.  When you get pulled over by a racist suspect in the form of what you call a pretended police officer, because police officers do not violate laws.  Race soldiers do.  But they pretend to be police officers.  Race soldier is a term I made up.  so that we don't get police officers confused with race soldiers.  That's two different things all together, a whole different world all together.  So when you get pulled over by a suspected race soldier, go into the three F's.  Don't fuss, don't fight, don't flee.  The people out somewhere out here right now are doing just that.  They're fussing.  They're jumping out with all this MF, MF this, and MF.  We think that 15 MFs will take care of it.  Not 2,000 MFs will take care of that situation, sir.  Based on what?  What Neely Fuller's saying?  No, based on evidence.  It's never worked.  You can't point to a situation where it worked.  You can't give any illustration in any so-called hood where you're jumping out and doing all that mouth work about what you don't like about the way the world is run to that person with that gun and badge, and you think that all of that cursing and whatnot is going to get you what you want, I say keep trying it.  But I say you'll do better if you don't fuss.  You don't fight and you don't flee.  Why?  Because the evidence shows a very simple thing, a universal thing.  It doesn't work.  Why keep doing something that doesn't work?  Why not try something that might work?  Now, that's not a guarantee because you've got to figure where you are.  The system of white supremacy is a prison system.  And we are already prisoners of war if you're a person of color.  They're not trying to round you up and put you into captivity.  You were captive before you were born in 2018.  Any person of color on this planet right now who's being born right this minute is born under the system of white supremacy.  So you're already in prison.  When they put us in what we call a jail cell or penitentiary, according to the code, that's what the code calls greater confinement.  You're already confined.  You're confined economically, educationally, the whole nine areas of activity.  You're confined.  Confined by whom?  By the white supremacists.  They tell you what you can do and what you better not do in all those areas of activity.  Name one that they don't.  That's why that coming together, that's just a bunch of black people on a slave ship.  They came together. ",
