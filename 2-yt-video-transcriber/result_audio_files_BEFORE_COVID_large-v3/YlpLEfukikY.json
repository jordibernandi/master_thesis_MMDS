First of all, thank you for being here.  Thank you for supporting me and watching my content.  I sincerely appreciate it.  Today's topic is about why cops, or why they don't touch the taillight of a vehicle, when they conduct a traffic stop.  I actually went to YouTube, and what I did was I went to the search bar and just started typing, why do cops?  And it auto-completed, touched the tail light of the car.  So that was obviously something that has been asked a lot on YouTube, probably a lot on Google, and I've addressed it in a few videos, like Q&As, live videos, things like that, but I've never dedicated a video to it, so this is it.  We're gonna put this to rest.  today, right here, right now.  The video that popped up when I did that search was from Brightside and it was called, Why Do Police Touch the Tail Light?  It's extremely important.  And I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm gonna title this video, Why Police Don't Touch the Tail Light.  It's extremely insignificant.  I have never been taught to touch the tail light on a traffic stop.  I have never touched, on purpose, the tail light of any vehicle on a traffic stop.  I was not trained in the academy to touch the tail light on a traffic stop.  I don't know a single officer that was ever taught to touch the tail light of a vehicle on a traffic stop.  And so I'm not sure where all the information comes from, what officers they spoke to to make this video.  Maybe they did.  I even talked to some old school retired cops about this and all of them unequivocally have told me they were never taught to do that, even if some of them did in the past.  So I'm going to break down the three reasons.  Bright Side Video here says on their channel why cops do this, and I'm going to explain to you why none of them are true, not even partially true, Untrue.  Quick note, this is not a criticism of anyone at that channel, their content.  This is the singular video of theirs I have ever watched, maybe ever will, I don't know.  So this is not an attack on anyone at all.  This is just simply a critique of the content as I consumed it.  The first reason they give is, quote, frighten the driver.  Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea for a cop to do is just to try to frighten the driver.  Now, if the purpose of this was to frighten the driver, listen, there are a lot of easier ways to frighten a driver as a cop than touching their stupid taillight.  Driver's license register.  What are you doing?  And touching the taillight to make a noise to startle someone inside?  We're not smacking the taillight.  They said touch the taillight.  How loud is touching a taillight?  You're not smacking it.  You're not picking the car up and down.  You're not hulking the car anyway.  And why would I want to scare someone in the car if they were holding on to something illegal, like a weapon that they wanted to hurt me with or had bad intent?  Why do I want to scare the driver into doing that?  That's literally self-contradictory.  We'll see that These three reasons as we see them in the video are actually inherently self-contradictory for the whole purpose of trying to do this.  If an officer wants to be safe, they're not going to be trying to purposefully scare anyone in the vehicle.  The second reason they give is to leave a fingerprint on the vehicle.  On that tail light, they're going to leave a print. ",

            "text": "The problem with this is that not only is that not true, real life isn't like CSI, guys.  You just don't go pick up fingerprints off of things as easy as everyone would like to think that it is.  especially on a car that's going to have multiple people touching the car over a long period of time, unknown, that in and of itself isn't all that helpful.  Again, I talk to people who are more old school cops, pre-camera days, like pre-body cam, pre-dash cam, and Maybe, maybe there was a group of people at some point, maybe in the past of cop legend, people used to touch the tail light.  But nobody alive that I've talked to.  If you're a cop that was trained to do it that way, please by all means drop it in the comments and yeah, explain who and where and why you were taught that.  I was not taught that at all.  It wouldn't be that reliable of a thing anyway.  Also mentioned in the video with this idea of startling people, there is this idea that you touch the vehicle to see if you could feel any movement, or maybe is the trunk secure?  Is someone gonna pop out from the trunk and attack me or something?  Or maybe someone's in the trunk.  Regardless, whatever may have ever been a practice somewhere doing this, it is certainly not practical today.  It is certainly far from an important thing to do.  It's just not done.  Like I've never even seen it.  And I've been a training officer.  I've never seen this.  If you've seen it, let me know.  I don't know why anybody would be doing it other than the fact that they watched this video before they become a cop and thought they were supposed to.  The last reason they give is actually laughable.  I literally laughed at the reason they gave because they say it is a ritual. ",

            "text": "A ritual is like Satan is sacrificing somebody.  A ritual is like a fraternity spanking a new member.  I don't know, it's a monk chanting.  I don't know what's going on in rituals.  But touching a tail light as a police officer is not a ritual.  The video literally says it's like a good luck charm.  It used to be something that kept them safe, so now it's just a tradition, a ritual, like a good luck charm to make sure that they're being safe or they're gonna be safe on this traffic stop from someone that may have ill intent to do them harm as a police officer.  It's literally laughable.  Like I said, this is self-contradictory.  If I'm trying to startle a driver, I'm not being safe.  I'm not being tactically sound.  if I'm doing something that's a tradition or a ritual that's going to intentionally startle them.  This makes no sense.  Again, not a tradition.  There's a lot of traditions.  Being safe is one of them.  Telling an officer, hey, stay safe.  Telling one another, stay safe, be safe.  Hey, got your six.  There are traditional phrases or concepts.  Even this shirt that I'm wearing, one asterisk.  We have one asterisk.  So you better take care of it.  The idea of being safe and tactfully sound is safe.  in some sense ritualistic, I guess, in the law enforcement community because we want to encourage each other to have safe practices and to be smart when we're doing this because in the event that someone does want to do us harm, we want to be ready for that and we want to be able to respond appropriately.  But touching a taillight is not one of those things at all.  never has been, is not, and I really hope never will be.  So that's my quick take on this.  It's actually more than I ever would have thought I needed to say on this topic, but that's it.  It's put to rest.  It's done.  Whatever it was, it isn't now, and it never will be, if it ever was.  Okay.  Good day. ",
