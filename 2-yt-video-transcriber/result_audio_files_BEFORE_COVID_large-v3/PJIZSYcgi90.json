            "text": "First off, I want to say I wasn't going to watch the Joker movie until I was able to see it for free because I don't believe in giving money to my enemies.  Well, sometimes it's hard to avoid this.  It's pretty easy to do when it comes to just not watching a movie at the theater.  I didn't expect to take a look at this movie for a while, but I got the opportunity to see it for free.  So I strapped in and I watched it and I realized I'd seen this movie several times before.  Now what I mean by this is there is absolutely nothing original about Joker.  In fact, it parallels other mostly Robert De Niro movies so closely.  I almost wonder if that's why they felt like they had to cast him in the film, in a part that really didn't suit his very limited acting range.  It's almost like they knew if they didn't include him, people would just be talking about how they just picked different scenes from movies he'd been in and rammed them together in something they could trick people into watching, which is exactly what they did.  In fact, you might be wondering how I can review this film at all without access to the footage and it's easy.  Even though the trailer is only a few minutes long, I can easily fill in all the blanks with movies that Joker is a carbon copy of.  So with that in mind, let's get started.  The movie starts out with Joker at his crappy job where he works with other misfits who are likely children of single mothers and because of their lack of a positive male role model for guidance, are just kind of failing through life.  We see how shitty and dangerous Joker's job is when on the street, doing his job, he's attacked by a gang of young diversity.  Next we see Joker laughing uncontrollably, like a maniac.  Okay, this clip is from Cape Fear.  It doesn't really count, but it still looks and sounds remarkably like Joker, so still funny.  I'm leaving it in there.  So Joker is talking to his government-issued life coach of color and tells her that the things are getting crazier.  People are getting tense.  He asks her to give him more medication, courtesy of the state, no doubt.  After getting his medication, he stares out at the decaying city, disgusted.  He tries to have a moment with a young black kid on the bus, but he's yelled at by the kid's presumably single mother.  And I'll say one thing about this.  I've heard people say that this movie is an indictment of single mothers.  And as with the other good things people are trying to read into this film, it's not that it's an indictment of single mothers.  It's just that it's, for the first time, maybe in a long time, it's not portraying all single mothers as strong, independent women.  There's no commentary.  It's just the absence of the leftist propaganda that many viewers are so used to hearing.  They're so conditioned.  They're expecting it.  that when it's not there, they think the absence of this message is somehow a message in their direction.  But obviously that's not true at all, and we'll see more of that.  So, Joker laughs uncontrollably, and hands the mother on his bus a card that explains he can't control his manic laughter.  And it's a nervous condition.  So throughout the movie, he just kind of laughs hysterically for no reason at inappropriate times.  He walks the street slowly, wading through the filth of the city, surrounded by the chaos and police sirens.  He comes home and talks to his aging single mom, who he lives with and is living off of disability.  She talks about writing letters to Thomas Wayne, who you could say is kind of a Donald Trump figure in the film.  He's a right-wing billionaire tycoon and he's running for mayor of Gotham.  They sit down and begin to watch a late night show.  and this is when the film switches from kind of mirroring Taxi Driver to incorporating elements of The King of Comedy.  The King of Comedy is a film where Robert De Niro plays a failed comic, just like Joker, who is obsessed with a late night talk show host, just like Joker.  Joker watches the show on television and imagines that he's in the studio, just like in King of Comedy, and the host of the show loves him, exactly like Robert De Niro's character in King of Comedy would do.  He invents a scenario in his head where the talk show host wants to be the father he never had.  I mean, it's very identical to King of Comedy.  Next, the film Joker switches back to mirroring Taxi Driver.  He's at work and his boss is blaming him for getting jumped and telling him that any damages will come out of his paycheck.  While coming home, he meets another black single mom in the elevator, but this one he's attracted to.  When he tries to flirt with her, he kind of just comes across like a psycho.  Essentially, just like Robert De Niro's characters in Taxi Driver and in The King of Comedy, they both have love interests and they both look like psychos when they approach them.  So because his job is obviously dangerous, one of the guys he works with gives him a gun.  He goes home and begins to practice and play with his new gun, just like the scene in Taxi Driver where Robert De Niro is doing kind of the same thing.  He then begins to stalk the woman he met on the elevator, following her around like a creep, just like Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver.  As I mentioned before, Robert De Niro's characters in Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, they're obsessed with women, but the women see them as too unbalanced to have a relationship with.  This is the exact same dynamic that exists with Joker.  A woman he's obsessed with, but he's too crazy to connect with.  The only difference is in Joker, the added twist, if you want to call it that, is that Joker is only imagining that he's with this woman.  So he's only fantasizing about a black single mom as a love interest.  imagining that she eventually dates him.  And the audience has led to believe that that's what's going on.  And based on, quite frankly, what I've heard some people say about the movie, some people still don't get it and think that they were actually in a relationship.  But no, he's fantasizing that she finds him funny and quirky and fantasizing that they go out a couple times.  But then later in the film, it's revealed, just like with Robert De Niro's characters, He's too crazy and unbalanced and there's no way at all that she would be attracted to him.  She's repulsed.  She's terrified of him.  The second she's around him long enough to find out that he's crazy.  Now in the next scene, I don't actually need any footage of a movie because I can just use a story that really happened that we're all familiar with.  The Jussie Smollett story.  You know, Jussie Smollett and his MAGA country fantasy.  That's essentially the blood libel that Joker perpetrates on the same people that lined up to go see the movie, by the way.  You see, Joker is coming home from work late at night.  He's still in his clown makeup.  He's depressed.  And then three white guys wearing MAGA hats.  Okay, I'm kidding about the MAGA hats, but they might as well be wearing MAGA hats.  It's three white guys wearing suits, hassling a woman on the train because, you know, as Jussie Smollett has taught us, there's nothing more dangerous late at night than a well-dressed white man.  So the well-dressed upper class white men start to violently attack Joker for really no reason.  You know, as wealthy white people are known to do, you know, always riding on trains late at night, assaulting people.  And Joker takes out his gun and kills the three kids in maga hats.  I'm sorry, in suits.  So after killing the three white guys, Joker fantasizes about having sex with his imaginary black girlfriend.  And then we find out that the three white guys not wearing maga hats worked for Donald Trump.  I'm sorry, Thomas Wayne.  I know, right?  Totally based.  So Joker then tells his government-issued life coach of color that the people are starting to resist.  He uses that word, and that is the word that's printed on the signs of the people in Antifa garb protesting around the city.  He's part of the resistance against these white people not wearing MAGA hats.  And so are the other dregs of society just like him that live with their single moms on disability.  Next, we see how bad Joker is at stand-up comedy.  His nervous laughter and his terrible jokes unsettles the audience, but he's too out of touch, too insane, too disconnected from reality to notice that.  And instead, he thinks his imaginary black girlfriend is laughing at all his jokes.  So after his imaginary date, he comes home and he finds out that his mother has been writing letters to Thomas.  Wayne slash Donald Trump because she claims he is Joker's father.  So he decides to go to Mar-a-Lago, I mean Wayne Manor, to claim what is his, but is told by the butler that his mother is just crazy and that he's adopted.  Donald Trump is not his father and she's not even his real mother.  So before he can confront his maybe fake mom about this, she has a stroke and then she's taken to the hospital.  While Joker's there, we find out that the talk show host that he was obsessed with earlier in the film, like in King of Comedy, is playing a clip of Joker's terrible stand-up comedy performance.  But not because he thinks it's funny, but because they're ridiculing him.  It's like a viral, cringy video.  So in addition to this assault on his ego, Joker ends up losing his job because he brings the gun that his friend gave him to a children's hospital.  And while he's on the job, it falls out of his clown pants and you know that it freaks out.  obviously the hospital and they fire and this pushes him a little further over the edge as well as a trip to the institution where his mother apparently was locked up.  he goes there to find out if the story of him being adopted is true to get more information about his history.  And he finds out that it's very possible he was adopted, although they kind of put in a sliver of ambiguity in there, although it doesn't really matter.  Either way, he finds out that his mother used to date violent men and was turned on by men that would abuse him and beat him.  He finds out that his nervous laughter is a result of these injuries. ",
