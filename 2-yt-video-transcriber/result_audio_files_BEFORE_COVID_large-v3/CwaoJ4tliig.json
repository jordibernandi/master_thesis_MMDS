            "text": "The people who say we are in favor of graduated taxation have to go to the next step and say, do we now have it?  If you look at the situation now, the graduated rates are a fake.  The rates go from 14% to 70% at the top, but very few people pay the higher rates because the income tax law is so full of loopholes.  There are so many loopholes that very few people pay it.  If you look at the average rate paid by people in different income classes, that rate is higher in the middle income classes than it is in the very highest income classes.  because the middle-income classes tend to have a much larger fraction of their income from wages, and it's harder to avoid taxes on wages.  The higher-income groups tend to have a larger fraction of their income from property, and therefore they can use capital gains, they can use state and local securities, etc.  Let's suppose you made no change in the law, except you put a flat 19% rate instead of 14 to 7, but left all the definitions.  In fact, you would raise a good deal more money than you do now.  The reason for that is it wouldn't pay people to get around the tax so much.  Here's a man who hires an expensive accountant, sets up a trust, makes gifts in order to get out of a 50 or 60 or 70 percent rate.  For 19 percent, it wouldn't be worth his while. ",
