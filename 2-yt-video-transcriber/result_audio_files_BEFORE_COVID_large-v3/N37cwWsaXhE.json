So I was reading a passage in Matthew 26, verse 24.  It's talking about Judas about to betray Jesus.  It says, Jesus says this of Judas.  It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.  Mm-hmm.  So God, before he created the universe, he saw how everything was going to unfold, all of our actions.  And he chose to create this particular universe. ",

The conclusion I drew is that in a better universe for Judas, he wouldn't have existed at all because that's what Jesus says.  So would it be from there that one could reasonably conclude that God is good, However, he does not always have the best interests of individuals, let's say, of Judas, of maybe people going to hell, that while he's good, and ultimately he will do what's good for himself, and he will do justice and all those things, for certain individuals like Judas, he could have created a better world where they wouldn't have existed.  but he chose to create this world anyway.  So would it be accurate to say God is good, but might not be good for certain humans or might not have humanity's best interests at heart? ",

            "text": "No, I don't think so, because when Jesus is using that it would be better for him to have never been born, he's using what... in that culture would be called hyperbole.  He's just saying how strong Judas' sin was.  He wasn't making a philosophical point like, let me back up the universe and go create a universe where Judas didn't exist.  That's not what he was talking about.  He was using hyperbole, and Jesus did this a lot, talking about it's better for you to cut your eye out if it causes you to sin, that kind of thing.  If you don't hate your mother and father more than you love me, or you should hate your mother and father compared to love for me.  These are all ways of saying a strong point in a very exaggerated way.  He's not making a philosophical point there.  But let me admit that one thing that is going on here is people will say, well, why didn't God create a universe where everyone was saved?  Well, that's logically possible, right?  That God could create a universe where everyone is saved, but it might not be actually achievable with free creatures.  Because by definition, if people are free, God can't force them to love him.  So any universe he creates is probably going to have people that reject him.  If that's the case, this might be the universe where he has the minimal number of people lost and the maximum number of people saved. ",
