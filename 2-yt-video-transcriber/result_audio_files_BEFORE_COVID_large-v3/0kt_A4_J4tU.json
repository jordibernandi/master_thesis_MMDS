Male homelessness, the issue no one is talking about.  Men make up the majority of the homeless population in the United States, and homeless women have it easier.  According to the HCH Clinicians Network, as of 2001, two-thirds of the homeless population in the United States consisted of men unaccompanied by children, and 84% of them are single adults between the ages of 25 and 54.  Despite the fact that 41% of homeless men have jobs versus only 27% of homeless women, homeless men are substantially less likely to have health insurance.  Where 62% of homeless men are lacking health insurance, only 40% of homeless women are uninsured.  Homeless men are also less likely to be on government assistance.  Only 22% of homeless men have Medicaid versus 47% of homeless women, and only 38% of homeless men receive government benefits versus 60% of homeless women.  But that study was conducted in 2001.  According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, as of 2007, unmarried men account for 76% of the homeless population.  The same report says 40% of homeless men are veterans, even though only 34% of the general population has served in the armed forces.  This means that, statistically, people who have served in the military are more likely to become homeless, and since men account for 84% of those serving in the military, this obviously means men are more affected.  According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, that figure has gone down in recent years, but veterans are still overrepresented among the homeless.  According to them, 91% of homeless veterans are men.  Because veterans are likely to suffer from traumatic brain injuries, PTSD, or other mental illnesses, and drug dependency, many of them become unemployable once they leave the service.  According to Pew Research Center, women are about twice as likely to be on food stamps than men are.  This could be a symptom of women having lower average income than men, and thus needing them more, or it could be because the requirements for SNAP benefits are more lenient if you have children.  And, as has already been established, homeless men are far less likely to be accompanied by children.  In fact, those without children can't even qualify for temporary assistance for families, and can only get SNAP benefits for three months out of every three years, unless they're working at least part-time, which may not even be possible for homeless men suffering from disabilities or mental illness, which is the case with most homeless veterans.  So if you're a single homeless man, you simply have fewer options than a homeless woman with kids.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, women of all age groups are more likely to receive public assistance.  An article on Journalist Resource points out that more women than men are on food stamps.  And like many other articles I've seen, their tone is that it's so terrible that so many women are dependent on these welfare systems.  But all of them ignore the fact that men aren't receiving these benefits as much as women, despite the fact that men make up the majority of the homeless population.  And this suggests to me that there are more men in need of these welfare systems, but are being denied access to them.  There is also a general assumption that any man who ends up homeless somehow deserves to be.  Peter Marin of the Alicia Peterson Foundation summarizes the situation rather succinctly in his article, Abandoning Men, Jill Gets Welfare, Jack Becomes Homeless.  To put it simply, men are neither supposed to nor allowed to be dependent.  They are expected to take care of others and themselves, and when they cannot or will not do it, then the assumption at the heart of the culture is that they are somehow less than men and therefore unworthy of help.  and irony asserts itself.  By being in need of help, men forfeit the right to it.  This isn't just a problem in the United States.  In the United Kingdom, 71% of the homeless population is male, and those homeless men are also substantially more likely to be addicted to drugs and to suffer from mental health problems than homeless women.  Despite this, the issues surrounding male homelessness get little to no public attention.  And to make matters worse, charities and advocacy groups which claim to be fighting homelessness don't seem interested in talking about how homelessness uniquely affects men, only when it affects women.  Why is it that even charities and advocacy groups have less sympathy for male victims?  That's a subject for another time. ",
