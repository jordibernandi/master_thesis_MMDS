            "text": "Okay, man, I don't even know how to say this.  My adrenaline is running.  Look at this.  I'm sitting here again, and I get the urge to go outside again, and it's cold.  I get my warm coat.  I go outside with my camera this time.  It's a little blurry right now.  I'm getting this fixed.  I get outside with my camera, and I see this, okay?  And I know immediately I've got something amazing going on there.  I'm looking to the southwest.  This is in the southwest.  This thing looks big.  It looks big.  It looks like it's a long ways away.  So anyway, I get the night vision on it.  And right now, I remember I'm thinking I should go get my Nikon.  But no, I'm not going to do that this time.  I'm staying with this sucker.  Okay, so I'm worried about the batteries on the camera because I haven't changed them yet.  I don't know how much life they have left in them.  But I'm watching this thing.  Look at this.  Look at this thing.  Oh my gosh.  My adrenaline is still running.  I'm almost shaking.  Okay, so I'm watching this.  I'm wondering where it's going to go.  Now we're on the over on the mountain's edge part of Las Vegas.  You're on over by the Blue Diamond Mine.  Look at how big this is.  It's unbelievable.  I thought about calling 911, but you know what?  I'm getting this out immediately.  No fancy anythings.  This is just the video itself, my testimony being recorded as I'm watching this for the first time.  And just watch how this thing flashes.  And I don't even know what all the little blinking lights are around it.  I wonder if something's being scrambled and if this thing's being monitored.  But once it starts moving, it is going to haul buns, I'll say, just to be politically correct.  Now, here it goes.  It's getting ready to go now.  And I'm seeing all these little blinky things around it.  But look what's going on.  I'm trying to get it and hopefully part of the city in the scene as I'm shooting the video.  That's Henderson over there.  And you'll see a part where all the Antana Mountain is right there.  Antana Mountain.  There's the beam from the Luxor.  And I don't know what the light is under there.  I wasn't going to be watching it.  But this thing is moving.  No sound, you guys.  No sound.  There was no sound at all.  I didn't hear anything.  No jet.  No sound.  I should have been able to hear something.  So I'm rushing this in once.  I figure I saw it for the last time.  Now it's passing up, I don't know if that's a jetliner or whatever.  It's still heading more toward Nellis.  It's heading toward like Interstate 15 going out of Las Vegas towards Mesquite, Nevada and Salt Lake City in Utah.  Now there's the hood over the chimney of my neighbor's home.  Now I'm seeing more of these little sparkly lights around this thing.  But I don't know how much time has gone by, but it has gone from way south of me to way north of me now.  It's probably traveled more than 30 miles real fast.  And I think it's very, very big.  Because no matter where it is, this is the biggest thing in the sky.  So, oh my gosh, I'm just going to stay with this.  I'll keep talking until the end of the video.  Now I'm looking to the east.  Now I see one light and a second flashing light right next to it.  Do you see that?  And then there's all these other little blinky lights.  Okay, now it is definitely over in the Nellis area.  I'm looking to the northeast, or more east than north, though.  I think this thing was huge.  I think this thing was enormous.  Right now, I'm thinking it's about 22, 23 miles away.  And once again, at the bottom of the screen, that's what you see is the tile, Spanish tiles on the roof of my neighbor's home.  I'm up higher.  That home is down lower, and so there's going to get to be a point where this gets low enough where I just can't, I can't see it anymore.  And that's where I decide to come in the house and do what I'm doing right now and get this out.  No logos, no intros, nothing.  The raw video, this is raw video, no editing, everything is in here.  You're going to see the whole thing.  It's almost done.  This is a major UFO event.  No one can tell me this is not a major UFO event.  I hope other people in town noticed this and started shooting video of it.  But I'm going to try to get this one out quick.  You know, I want people to know that I'm an honest person.  I'm never going to try to pull the wool over anybody's eyes.  I love doing this.  I make a job out of doing this.  And I think I'm pretty good at it.  I just don't want to keep taking a pounding for people that think that because something blinks or because it has red and green lights that it has to be something conventional.  That isn't the truth.  So here we go, man.  I'm going to get this out right now. ",
