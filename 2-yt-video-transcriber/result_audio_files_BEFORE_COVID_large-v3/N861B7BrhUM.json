            "text": "While he assessed that it was too late to run then, polling indicates that 2016 may have been too early, since Joe Biden's support looks even stronger today.  In poll after poll, Biden's prospects for 2020 look stronger than any other potential or declared Democratic candidate.  He is shown to be the top choice in all but five of the last 30 polls on the topic tracked by FiveThirtyEight.com.  Two of those five were ties, which included Biden.  Real clear politics shows a similar pattern, with Biden leading in all of the last 13 polls, with an average spread of 20.5 points.  Unlike Clinton in 2016, or Trump then and now, Biden is also extremely well-liked throughout the country.  In every popularity poll RCP has collected since August of 2018, Biden has a positive spread.  In the last five polls, his net favorability has been plus 17, plus 21, plus 30, plus 32, and plus 24 points, respectively.  Popular throughout the country and the top dog when it comes to Democratic support, Biden appears to be the strongest contender for the Democratic primary, with a strong chance of beating Trump in the general, at least for now.  While Biden undoubtedly appears to be a very strong candidate for the Dems, I count at least five potential issues that his campaign will likely face if he were to throw his hat into the ring.  I'll leave it to you to let me know what you think of Biden in the comments section.  But with his popularity as high as it is, I'll attempt to answer the question, what could stop him?  Currently, Joe Biden is probably best known as the former vice president who might have won in 2016, but did not because of a family tragedy.  The idea that he lost his chance to run because of the passing of his son no doubt draws personal sympathy.  Once he becomes a real contender for the most powerful office in the land, that sympathy might take a backseat to the day-to-day business of the primary process.  The reality is that Joe Biden has been out of the political spotlight since 2016, and for eight years prior to that, he was in the spotlight, but in a position that doesn't exactly draw serious scrutiny.

            "text": "Unlike Dick Cheney, Biden was a fairly typical VP, who mostly played the role of Obama's mascot.  This has been a particularly beneficial situation for Joe since Obama, by some measures, is even more popular than he is.  While the January 2019 Harvard-Harris poll found that 56% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Biden, Obama is favored by 59%.  A previous Harvard-Harris survey found that the most common self-identification of Democratic voters was Obama Democrat, a label more popular than liberal Democrat, moderate Democrat, or environmentalist.  Embarking on his own presidential campaign will mean being judged on his own merits, by his own platform, his own words, and his own capabilities.  And if history is any judge, Biden is not particularly good at running for president.  Like breaking up, running for president is hard to do.  Hillary Clinton, an extremely well-known Democrat, tried twice and failed both times.  I don't think I need to argue the point that there is no real interest in seeing Clinton run in 2020 or ever again.  Even CNN's Chris Colizza argued that she should not give it another go.  Democrats should be rooting very hard against another presidential bid by Clinton.  Joe Biden has also had two failed runs.  So why should Biden get a third chance if Clinton shouldn't?  Well, to be fair, Clinton's history differs from Biden's.  In her second run, she won the Democratic primary and went on to lose to a historically unpopular GOP candidate.  In Biden's case, his second loss was to an extremely popular Democratic candidate who would go on to select him as his running mate and win two terms with that same ticket.  Let's be honest, for Democrats, it's clearly more favorable to lose to a Democrat and go on to beat Republicans than it is to beat out Democrats and then lose to a Republican.  Still, being a two-time loser does not exactly bode well for Biden.  It is itself an issue, but nevertheless one that I expect is not insurmountable.  Far more problematic are some of the reasons behind his past losses.  One of those is his long history of gas.  Biden has been long known as a sufferer of foot and mouth disease.  Here are some of his most famous gaffes. ",

Biden is likely to run into trouble when he doesn't choose his words carefully.  But potentially even more problematic for Joe is the fact that he has a long history of choosing words that aren't his own.  Joe Biden's plagiarism dates back as far as his time in law school.  As the New York Times reported during his first run for president in 1987, Senator Joseph R. Biden  Jr.,  fighting to salvage his presidential campaign, today acknowledged a mistake in his youth when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.  Mr.  Biden insisted, however, that he had done nothing malevolent, that he had simply misunderstood the need to cite sources carefully.  The plagiarized article, Tortious Acts as a Basis for Jurisdiction in Products Liability Cases, was published in the Fordham Law Review of May 1965.  Mr.  Biden drew large chunks of heavy legal prose directly from it, including such sentences as, \"...the trend of judicial opinion in various jurisdictions has been that the breach of an implied warranty of fitness...\" is actionable without privity because it is a tortious wrong upon which suit may be brought by a non-contradicting party.  Biden plagiarized so blatantly that he actually defended his plagiarism to school administrators by pointing out how obvious the plagiarism was, arguing that if he was doing it on purpose, why would he be so blatant?  His explanation was accepted, and he was allowed to repeat the course, earning a B. Sadly, Biden's plagiarism did not end when he graduated law school.  In fact, the New York Times actually reported on his plagiarism in school because of another growing plagiarism scandal then facing his presidential campaign.  In another article from 1987, the Times reported, At the Democratic National Convention in 1976, Hubert Humphrey, then a senator from Minnesota, declared, The ultimate moral test of any government is the manner in which it treats three groups of its citizens.  First, those who are in the dawn of life are children.  Second, those who are in the shadows of life are sick, are needy, are handicapped.  and those third in the twilight of life are elderly.  Senator Biden's version offered a nation noble enough to treat those at the dawn of life with love, those at the dusk of life with care, and those who live in the shadow of life with compassion.  Biden did not acknowledge that he was paraphrasing Humphrey, and this was by no means the only speech he stole from.  Here he is extensively plagiarizing British MP Neil Kinnock. ",
