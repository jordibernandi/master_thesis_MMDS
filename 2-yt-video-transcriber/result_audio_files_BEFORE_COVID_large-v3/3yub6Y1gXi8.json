            "text": "Shalom.  With great anticipation, after counting the 49 days of the Omer since Passover, and with great joy, we now prepare to observe the festival of Shavuot.  This Saturday evening, at the conclusion of Shabbat, the people of Israel the world over will observe the festival of Shavuot.  Shavuot is the anniversary of G-d's revelation at Mount Sinai.  At this event, which changed the course of history, the Creator bequeathed the Torah and its commandments to Israel.  Israel entered into a covenant with G-d and received her unique divine mission to live according to G-d's commandments and thus to sanctify the name of G-d before the eyes of the entire world.  The word Shavuot literally means weeks, and like a person waiting for a very exciting date, we have been counting the days and weeks, 49 days, seven complete weeks, this bridge in time since Passover, this period of time known as the counting of the Omer, as commanded in Leviticus 23, and you shall count for yourselves.  from the day following the great Sabbath, from the day you bring the Omer wave offering, seven complete weeks they shall be.  The omer, you will recall, refers to a measure, a measure of barley, raw barley which was roasted and brought as a special offering to the Holy Temple on the second day of Passover.  Exactly seven weeks prior to Shavuot, at the Exodus from Egypt marked by the festival of Passover, Israel became a nation.  The reality of the Exodus, on the backdrop of the miracles that attest to G-d's preeminent love for Israel, saw Israel gain her physical freedom and national identity.  As the verse states, has G-d ever tried to come to take a nation from out of the midst of another nation, with signs and wonders and in war and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm and with great wonders like all that Hashem your G-d has done for you?  But although they gained their physical freedom on the night of Passover, in a flash of sudden godly illumination, the Israelites were still suffering from the effects of a long ingrained slave mentality, called by our sages a state of constricted consciousness.  This is alluded to by the Omer barley offering on Passover, for raw barley is consumed by animals, but it is not fit for human consumption.  It would, and it still does, take the step by step spiritual process of the 49 day count marked by intense inner spiritual preparation, to deserve freedom, to merit freedom.  The freedom to receive the Torah, the freedom to choose between right and wrong, to choose to be servants of the one true living G-d, and never again to be slaves to Pharaoh and all that Egypt represents.  Now just as Passover marks the physical birth of the Jewish people as a nation, Shavuot represents Israel's spiritual inception.  The festival of Shavuot is intrinsically tied to the birth of the Jewish people as a nation, as the nation of the Torah, at the Sinai Revelation.  There, at the foot of Mount Sinai, the Jewish people received the assignments.  to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, the Torah itself is the covenant that was forged between the Holy One and Israel, and is both the call for, and the guide to, Israel achieving her destiny as that kingdom of priests and holy nation.  The festival of Shavuot is known by a number of names.  Shavuot itself means weeks, for the weeks that we have been counting.  But actually, in Levix 23, where we encounter the concept and commandment to count the omer, Shavuot is not identified by a specific name, but rather is referred to as the fiftieth day, that is, the culmination and crescendo, an achieved goal, of the count.  There, Torah tells us that this 50th day is the day that we are commanded to offer a very unique offering in the Holy Temple.  Two loaves of baked leavened wheat bread, the only chametz leavened bread that is offered in the Holy Temple.  And these twin loaves are also called bikurim, for us fruit offerings.  Torah calls it the festival Shavuot in Deuteronomy 16 and verse 16, but Torah also calls this festival Yom HaBikurim, which means the day of first fruits, we find that in Numbers 28 verse 26.  Torah also calls Shavuot Chag HaKatzir, the harvest festival, in Exodus 23.  And in the literature of our sages it is referred to as Atzeret, an assembly, a day for cessation of labor.  and in our prayers we refer to this as the time of the giving of the Torah.  But it's these names, the Day of First Fruit and the Harvest Festival, which characterize the main aspect of the holiday as it is celebrated in the time of the Holy Temple.  For more than any other festive observance, Shavuot is the special festival connected to the Land of Israel.  The holiday itself has a special connection to the Land.  In the time of the Holy Temple, Torah mandates that the festival of Shavuot should be marked by special Temple observances, in addition to the Omer.  which comes from the barley of the land, the particular commandments which are fulfilled on Shavuot and the Holy Temple can only be done in the Land of Israel, and they also emphasize the intrinsic holiness of the Land, the special offering of the twin loaves, and the bringing of the bikurim, the first fruits of the harvest.  There are seven species for which the Land of Israel is blessed, as testified to by Torah.  It's called a land of wheat, barley, grape, fig and pomegranate, a land of oil olives and date honey, that famous verse in Deut.  8 and verse 8.  Shavuot is the inauguration of the first fruit season, which extends all the way to Sukkot.  Indeed, the bikurim, the first fruits brought on Shavuot, were only the beginning of the season, and were limited to wheat and barley, which are the only species ready for harvest by this time of year.  The other fruits would totally ripen only later on in the summer.  Above all, the main aspect of the first fruits festival in the Holy Temple was the bringing of the shte ha-lechem, these two large loaves made of the first wheat grains of the new harvest.  But in addition, every Jewish farmer brought the produce of his fields.  firstfruits of these seven species in which the Land of Israel is blessed.  The farmers would bring this produs, known as the bikurim, the firstfruits, bring it to the priest serving in the courtyard of the Holy Temple.  As we learn at the beginning of parashat Ki Tavo in Deut.  26, this bringing of the firstfruits is part of a moving, emotional, evocative ceremony wherein the pilgrim presents the firstfruits of his field to the kohen.  The fruits are waved before the presence of G-d, and set down before the altar of Hashem, the place from where Adam was created.  The Israelite utters a powerful and highly personal declaration of acknowledgement, confession and thanks.  The Mishnah describes in beautiful detail how the first fruits were chosen.  A man goes into his field and sees a fig that is first to ripen, or a cluster of grapes that is first to be ready, or the first pomegranate to ripen.  He ties it with a band and declares, these are the first fruits.  Now these three fruits that are mentioned here in this Mishnah grow and ripen in midsummer, and thus we can assume that the main bringing of bikurim took place later, for example on the joyous day of Tuva Av, the 15th of the month of Av.  For this is a time when a person can go to his field and find all three types of these fruits mentioned ready at the same time, while the other species of the land, such as olives and dates, still need a few more weeks to ripen.  Indeed Shavuot is the outstanding holiday of Eretz Yisrael, the Land of Israel.  The first fruit offering in the Holy Temple is the ultimate expression of joy, it's the unique joy of living in this Land that G-d has given us.  As we find reflected in the recitation of the pilgrim in the Temple, after he has handed his basket of first fruits to the priest and the latter has set it down before the altar, he declares And you shall rejoice in every good thing which Hashem your G-d has given you.  So bringing the firstfruits to the Holy Temple afforded Israel the opportunity to be uplifted to a new height, by giving back to Hashem that which He has given us, and closing the circle.  The preparation, the bringing and the offering of the firstfruits in the Holy Temple illustrates G-d's purpose in giving the Torah to Israel, and Israel's job description, namely to elevate the physical by revealing its spiritual essence and thereby allowing the light of holiness to shine in this world.  The band is tied on the fruit while it is yet on the tree.  Everything This is the statement, the whole land, all its fruit, all its physicality, it's innately holy, to be brought to Hashem in the Temple to acknowledge Him in deep appreciation and recognition.  All this is the way in which the festival of Shavuot is celebrated during the time of the Holy Temple.  However, since the destruction of the Temple, with Israel unable to fulfill the Temple-related mitzvot, the main aspect of the observance of Shavuot has shifted to an emphasis on its special efforts in extra-Torah study.  There is an ancient custom called Tikkun Ler Shavuot, which means the rectification of the night of Shavuot.  It is an ancient custom to stay awake, whoever is able to, the entire night of Shavuot, studying the Torah with vigor and not allowing ourselves to sleep or even to nod off.  those who can muster the energy to do this.  After such a night of intense spiritual preparation, the morning service becomes like a reenactment of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai.  Each individual in the community hears the portion of the Ten Commandments read from the Torah and the vivid description of Israel's encounter with G-d at the Sinai revelation, and, hopefully, internalizes the moment and enters into the covenant with renewed strength and commitment.  But this custom of wakefulness on this night It is also a tikkun, a spiritual rectification, designed to fix a previous mistake.  For our sages teach a very famous Midrashic teaching, that when Israel camped at Mount Sinai, ready to receive the Torah, night before Shavuot, somehow, incredibly, they overslept, the most important moment of their lives.  And they had to be wakened on Shavuot morning by the Holy One Himself, so by staying up And studying the Torah with enthusiasm, we clearly state that this time around we want to be ready.  So this Midrashic teaching may seem a bit whimsical, but actually imparts a deep message.  Sometimes one can be so close to a fulfillment, so close as close as can be, even at the very foot of Mount Sinai, and yet lose the chance, waste it, squander the moment.  In order to really be ready for G-d, you've got to make that extra effort.  But, open up your heart in the deepest way.  In reality, this custom of the Tikkun Lel Shavuot, of staying up and studying Torah the night of Shavuot, is a later custom, and while there is some evidence for the argument that it dates possibly to the first century, its popularity has grown in the past few hundred years.  Yet in the time of the Holy Temple this practice was unknown, and Shavuot was known as the time of the first fruits, not as a time of redoubled Torah study.  This apparent dual nature of Shavuot may strike us as strange.  Making a special effort in Torah study seems to make sense and to be a proper and fitting homage for the holiday, if indeed the festival is none other than the anniversary of the very giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai.  Yet when the Temple stood, Hashem Himself mandates Shavuot as a time for bringing the beautiful praiseworthy fruits of the Land of Israel to the Temple, and there is no evidence that in Temple times the custom of all night Torah study was practiced.  And specifically this is what strikes us as strange.  The Torah is our spiritual inheritance and was bequeathed by G-d to Israel at Sinai, in thunder, lightning and fire, in the sound of the shofar, an event described as profoundly supernatural.  Why would the divinely ordained commandment of the day, for how the day should be observed, why would it instruct us to be involved with the produce of the land?  In other words, is it indeed the festival of the harvest, the day of the first fruit, or is it the time of the giving of the Torah?  Why mark a spiritual event with a physical celebration?  Yet when the Temple stands, the pilgrimage festival of Shavuot takes place in an entirely different, seemingly opposite and very material dimension, the bringing of the firstfruits of the Land of Israel to the Holy Temple, accompanied by expressions of thankfulness to Hashem for the bounty of the Land.  So I could say, will the real Shavuot please stand up?  Which is it really?  The anniversary of the Torah, to be marked by Torah study, the heaven sent word of G-d, or the day of the first fruit to be marked by agricultural observances, the very essence of earthiness.  So by now your heart is hopefully open in the deepest way.  The truth is, there is no contradiction, and herein lies the essence of the beauty of Shavuot, and the true meaning and power of Torah.  The Torah is all about serving G-d in this world.  The festival is a celebration of the giving of the Torah, and thus it is a celebration of this world.  The Torah is about how to serve G-d through our actions.  The bringing of the first fruits in the Holy Temple and Shavuot, and the accompanying words of praise and gratitude to Hashem, is the embodiment of service through action.  And this is the fulfillment of the challenge of Torah.  The two baked loaves of leavened bread offered on Shavuot in the Holy Temple symbolize the graduation from barley, from slave mentality, from constricted consciousness, to the fulfillment of human potential, the exercising of free will, and our willful acceptance of responsibility of our own actions by accepting the Torah.  Bread is the fruit of men, and the offering of the twin loaves represents the ongoing relationship between G-d and man.  What was once raw grain, harvested on the second day of Passover, fit only for beasts, has now, with time and effort, become two loaves, the result of man's partnership with G-d and creation, fit to be consumed in the courtyards of the Holy Temple.  And as such, the bringing of the bikurim on Shavuot, the very day of receiving the Torah, is a perfect way to celebrate the Torah itself and speaks most eloquently of exactly what the message of Torah is for this world.  For this world.  that this world, our efforts in this world, and G-d's blessing in this very physical world, is what matters.  It's all that matters.  And the entire purpose of Torah is to elevate this world first and foremost by revealing His presence and design and purpose in everything in this world.  The first fruits and the twin loaves of wheat bread offered in the Holy Temple on Shavuot are like the manifestation of Torah planted in this world, sprouting forth from the very earth that G-d created for our benefit.  Indeed, the Torah was given to man because this is the world that counts, the world that Hashem loves.  Torah is so down to earth, down to this earth, and involved with this world, it's the celebration of and the sanctification of life in this world.  And I'm guessing that if it could be said that G-d has a favorite holiday, this must be it.  It is no wonder that Shavuot, festival of the giving of the Torah, festival of the Land of Israel, is also the birthday, as well as the anniversary of the passing of King David, the righteous leader of Israel and the herald of Messianic potential and redemption, who toiled more than any other to clarify and rectify and express the collective soul of humanity as evidenced by the book of Psalms, and who, through everything that he did all throughout his life, sought to elevate this world.  May we merit to prepare ourselves properly for the greatest event of our lives, which takes place not only on Shavuot, but every day.  Receiving the Torah anew, renewing our covenant with the Almighty, and taking responsibility for our own actions, that's the Torah, living for Divine purpose, bringing the light of the Torah into our own lives, into the Land of Israel, and into the whole world.  Happy and fulfilling Shavuot.  Chag Sameach.  Thank you. ",
