Anyway, our friend Ranty Flat Earth is going to give us the dose of reality we need to turn my brother Cat back to the globe.  Let's have a look at some of his work so far.  common argument amongst flat earthers is that boats do not sail over the horizon and if you film with a powerful enough camera like a P900 or P1000 the zoom alone is enough to bring that boat back into focus.  So Randy Flat Earth set out with his P1000 to bust this claim by filming this boat for 30 minutes as it sailed over the horizon until no zoom could bring it back.  Another claim made by flat earthers is that the bottom of distant objects do not get obstructed by earth curvature.  So Rancy Flat Earth set out to bust that claim by filming this underwater lighthouse and these underwater buildings.  But flat earthers being flat earthers still refuse to accept that earth curvature has anything to do with objects vanishing from the bottom up as they move into the distance.  In fact, they invent a whole host of ridiculous ideas to try and explain this phenomenon.  One of those being the angle of attack.  This essentially says that as something moves away from you on a flat surface, it will disappear from the bottom up due to something called perspective.  So when I asked Ranty Flat Earth to go down to a perfectly flat racetrack to debunk this claim, he just couldn't wait.  And you'll see that these tiny objects he's put at the end of a track show no sign of vanishing from the bottom up just because of distance.  Good work, Ranty.  Now, despite all of that good work, Ranty Flat Earth has so far been pretty reluctant to show his evidence of refraction in the atmosphere.  You see, sometimes we do make observations further than we should be able to see, thanks to the effects of atmospheric refraction, and this is something that's been given the name looming.  But with videos titled Flat Earth Destroying the Looming Argument and What is Looming?  the Insanity of the Globe Model, Ranti has made it clear that this is a process he does not accept.  Now, despite not believing in it, Ranty Flat Earth has agreed to join us and explain to us live what looming actually is meant to be.  But right now, he's just finishing off one of his Flat Earth astronomy lectures.  So as we go over, let's make sure we're nice and quiet. ",
