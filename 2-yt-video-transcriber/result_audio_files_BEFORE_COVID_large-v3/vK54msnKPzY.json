            "text": "Why single men are the prize.  Are you a good catch as a man?  Do you have much to offer?  Not just material, but time and commitment also.  Are you a man that could change a woman's life?  you actually give a woman a life or improve on the one she already has?  See the reason I say this is due to common understanding that men generally have to have something to provide.  We have to be able to offer a woman security in some way or form or we have to serve a purpose to a woman that is a benefit to her.  See as men we give.  We are not only programmed genetically to be providers and protectors, but psychologically, we are programmed to be this.  Even if you've been through hell in your love life, as a man, if you stop any further pursuit of women, then that is a cause for insults and shame.  No matter how bad your experiences were, they're not all the same, are they?  And everyone will say to you, just get on with it.  See for me, this only proves how valuable a man's focus is.  That's why we are the only ones that are shamed for choosing to be single bachelors.  It is very easy as men to see how much value we can offer a woman.  But how many men ask a woman?  That is the question.  How many men ask a woman, what value could she bring you?  If sex is the value, then you're good, you're fine.  That's all she needs to give you.  Great, good for you.  But if you truly understand your value, then it becomes a sense of, she really has to have more to offer than that.  I can get that from another woman.  What makes her stand out?  My life is not built so much around sex that that is all it takes to lure me in or to control me.  See, as men, being the fact that we have no choice but to do much in our lives, it forces us to develop more skills, to try new things, to understand we have to have something about us for a woman to want us anyway.  We had no choice but to develop ourselves into attractive, valuable men who can offer something in order to be able to be a good provider and make a stable home.  We as men have value, but it's up to you as an individual man to see your value.  And to summarize, in saying that we are the prize is not a downplay of women or to say they're inferior.  It's more a sense of understanding that we as men are the givers.  We are the ones that have to have something to give.  We can't rely on looks or having a cool personality alone.  We have to be able to offer a woman safety, comfort and security, among other things.  It's then we may be seen as a catch.  And many men that were seen as a catch were the ones doing something with their lives, or having something about them, something of value to a woman.  We are givers.  Only those with something to give have something to offer.  The greatest, most extravagant gifts have been the ones given by men.  Sad thing is, many men only find their true value in giving.  with little understanding of the prize that he is now is a gift.  thus it's called the present.  but do you presently see and understand your own value as in to focus observe remember the world is yours.  Have a nice day. ",
