            "text": "Hey guys, BigSwearRoadDriver.com.  Last chance.  Last chance to get cheap cryptos, cheap silver.  Again, remember, they can put the price at zero with the click of a mouse.  You won't be able to get them off the exchange, though, if you bought.  And they can shut down this market in the blink of an eye.  Clearly, they're putting the last screws in on the cryptocurrencies.  Buy, buy, buy.  Get your cryptos.  Get them off the exchanges.  It is happening.  I will show you something else that just happened.  Silver.  Look at the price of gold and look at the price of silver.  Gold gets slammed this morning.  Silver jacks sky high.  Never happens.  You can't show me one time in history that has happened.  At least since I've been in silver for over 20 years.  When they slam gold, they slam silver.  It's the same computer program.  Someone knows just how valuable silver is to destroy the system.  And not only that, look at this.  Deutsche Bank clients are pulling $1 billion out of Deutsche Bank every single day.  Every single day.  There's a reason James Simon's Rintech is the world's best-performing hedge fund.  It spots trends even if they are glaringly obvious, well ahead of almost everyone else, and certainly long before consensus.  That's what happened with Deutsche Bank when we reported two weeks ago the Quant Fund pulled its cash from Deutsche Bank as a result of soaring counterparty risk.  Just days before the full, and to many devastating, extent of the German lender's historic restructuring was disclosed.  and would result in a bank that is radically different from what Deutsche Bank was previously.  In any case, now Rentech is long gone and questions about the viability of Deutsche Bank are swirling.  Yes, it won't be insolvent overnight, but like the world's biggest melting ice cube, there is simply no equity value there anymore.  Everyone else has decided to cut their counterparty risk with the bank with the $45 trillion in derivatives.  And according to Bloomberg, Deutsche Bank clients, mostly hedge funds, have started a bank run, which has culminated with about $1 billion per day being pulled from the bank.  We are on the brink of panic.  It is coming down.  The timing couldn't be better.  It is all happening.  When you see crap like this, the crypto is being sold off.  It is on the computer program that these things are rigged on.  No, people aren't losing faith in cryptocurrency.  Yes, it is being rigged.  Yes, it is being rigged by the U.S.  government, the Fed, and those people really controlling the strings.  It's so easy to rig.  Just go to any derivative exchange, which are all of them, and hit sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.  Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.  None of these exchanges have the cryptos.  Now is the time.  I told you this was coming.  Huge panic.  It could be set to a million dollars or one dollar with a click of a mouse.  This is the kind of insanity that happened.  And this is never seen.  Silver spiking with gold dropping and then coming back up.  You can't show me one time in history in the last 20 years that this has happened.  Yes, it is happening.  It is time.  Deutsche Bank will not, they're even talking about it on the news.  Deutsche Bank will not last long.  If Deutsche Bank goes, everything goes.  How long does it take to settle a derivative contract?  Three to four weeks.  Where are we in this process?  On the road to Ruta?  Well, you know if you're a Patreon subscriber.  Let me tell you, this is a 2019 event.  Hey, Trent, I'll give you the time and the day.  The day and the exact time.  But this is happening.  The world's largest bank derivative holder with 45 trillion euros in derivatives is going under.  It didn't go under today.  It might tomorrow.  And if you're looking at three to four weeks of derivative payments and then to kick in, then to default, and then the other banks default, they can't get their derivative payments.  It is happening.  Billions are leaving Deutsche Bank.  Billions every single day.  What's the smart money going to do?  They're going to run and try to get their billions out.  They're going to have to shut the doors, just like they did with Lehman and Bear Stearns.  And it's happening right now.  It is happening 100% on purpose.  The only way to survive this, yes, they can put the price of silver at zero with a click of a mouse as well.  It's easy to do.  If you're the exchange stabilization fund, click, put Bitcoin to zero, put silver to zero, but they don't want to do that.  With Bitcoin and silver and gold, it's not in your own possession.  The price doesn't mean anything.  These are derivative trades.  It's got nothing to do with the real thing.  If you don't have it in your possession now, good freaking luck.  Ever, ever get it.  You have your coins on Coinbase, on Kraken, on Gemini.  Good luck getting your coins.  Banking system goes down.  Those companies need fiat money to play their game.  They pay their employees in fiat money.  They're going to freeze up just like Mt.  Gox.  You're going to have eight years in bankruptcy just like Mt.  Gox.  Get them out and get it in your own possession now.  Absolutely.  100%.  That's BigSquareRotary.com.  with an urgent update.  I'll talk to you guys later. ",
