            "text": "Hey everybody out there in YouTube land.  I saw this short clip quite a while back which I'll share with you in a moment.  But it came up again when doing some research online and I thought I'd take another look.  Now there was actually a person that's very pro Bethel that did an article on this also expressing his concern for the call to repentance or should I say lack of repentance with Bill's message.  So I listened to this short clip and I realized that there really was no message of sin, repentance, or why we need Jesus, but only about what you need.  So I signed up on the Bethel site to be able to hear the full ending and yet still heard nothing, only asking for people to come up for others to pray for you.  But someone praying for somebody doesn't save anybody.  Now, to be fair, perhaps they turned the cameras off and after this people started telling others about how offensive sin is to God and that we are all guilty and there's a need for repentance, but I doubt it.  This prompted me to do a search on the Bethel TV site for a message about sin, but I found nothing.  I did another search on how to be saved, but only got these three videos that don't even address the topic.  Of course, God can save anyone at any time in any way He chooses and in any situation.  But for the most part, preaching the wrong reason of why we need Jesus will usually not bring people to their knees with a truly repentant heart.  Anyhow, here's the clip and please share your thoughts on this in the comments below. ",

            "text": "Those who are watching online, we love you.  Thanks for joining us.  It's our Bethel family away from here.  Those that are watching in overflow rooms, we bless you.  We're glad that you joined us.  Those who are watching in the IMAX theater actually have a better view than the rest of us.  Don't know that there's much to look at, but you get the picture.  Whenever we come together, I just don't ever again not want to give occasion for people to know what it is to be born again.  I was thinking earlier today, some statements that Jesus made that just are so sobering.  I don't like to lose awareness of these statements because this is where I started in Christ.  And I love the opportunity to hear the pure gospel just preached again.  I love that.  And these statements that he made, here's one.  He said, what does it profit a man a woman, if they gain the whole world but they lose their own soul?  What is the profit of a person if every ambition, every dream is fulfilled, every wish and want is covered, every possible appetite is fulfilled in life and you come to the end of it all and you've lost your own soul?  It's a good question.  because there's a day coming when it's the only question that will matter.  What does it profit a person to get it all and to lose it all?  And then he made this other comment.  He said, you must be born again.  There's not multiple options.  You must be born again.  I want to introduce you to the Father, but your conversion is what qualifies you.  And I know every time we come together, I want to make sure that I give opportunity for people to know what it is, to love God, to have a relationship with God, to be forgiven, to be what the Bible says, born again.  It's changed from the inside.  It's not an external discipline that changes.  We can't change that stuff.  It's He who changed me.  And so what I wanna do is I just wanna give a very simple opportunity for anyone in this room that would just say, Bill, I don't wanna leave the building, I don't wanna leave the property until I know I'm at peace with God, until I know I've been forgiven, until I know that I've been brought into his family.  By doing this, you're saying, Bill, I want to be a disciple of Jesus.  I want to follow him and him alone.  If that's anybody in the room, I just want you to put a hand up.  Just by putting your hand up, you're saying, Bill, that's me.  I don't want to leave the building until I know I'm at peace with God. ",

And once again, please do leave your comments on what you think.  Like I say, I'm not really judging Beth on this.  Maybe they were preaching a strong gospel message after the cameras were turned off.  But like I said, I highly doubt that based on what I've seen.  So we'll leave it at that for today.  But until we see you next time, take care and God bless. ",
