Not with how well done it was, but with how many fallacies and misdirections it contained in just three minutes.  It's a work of mastery, really.  Turek is a professional apologist, and in my opinion, he represents his ilk very well.  He's articulate, charismatic, rather ignorant of basic science, and above all, loyal to defending his narrative regardless of what dishonesty that necessitates.  This clip revolves around what Turek thinks of Douglas Adams' puddle analogy as a response to arguments for intelligent design like the teleological argument.  Eventually, Turek poses a question and says that if atheists can answer it, it'll do away with his own argument for good.  If you don't know what the puddle analogy is, don't worry, we'll get to that.  For context, though, let's play a little bit of the clip first. ",

In case you're wondering, this statement that the universe had a beginning, or that the nature of the cosmos is such that it allows for life as we know it to exist, is no problem for the puddle analogy.  The analogy just shifts perspectives, presenting the possibility that the universe existed first and that we, in our evolution, came to exist as a creature which fits its pre-existing environment.  Very simply put, it entertains the thought that we are a result of adaptation to our environment, rather than asserting that the environment was built specifically to accommodate the capabilities and limitations of humans.  Given that the fossil record demonstrates that modern humans have been around for a couple hundred thousand years at most, and radiometric dating of ancient rock formations like zircon crystals show Earth to be over four billion years old, I think it's worth entertaining the idea that we adapted to what was already here.  Getting back to Turek, it's pretty obvious that he's heard all this before, so what I have to conclude is that Turek has either heard this repeatedly and still doesn't understand it, or that he understands this argument can't properly refute it, and chooses to restate his previous argument in hopes of distracting everyone away from the point he can't refute.  Now, I highly doubt that Turek is actually unintelligent enough to not understand the puddle analogy, so that leaves the other possibility that Turek is dishonest. ",

If I gave an example of a perceived message existing but then being shown to be caused by natural forces, Would that satisfy this question?  It would, right?  Okay, then I'll cite multiple examples.  In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft orbited Mars and took a photo of its surface, which revealed a rock structure that appeared just like a humanoid face.  NASA released the photo to the public and many saw it as an intelligently created structure meant to convey some artistic meaning or a signal to humans on behalf of Martians.  When Mars Global Surveyor photographed the same structure again in 1998 with a much better camera, the formation was shown to be a natural formation with no features of a face.  The appearance of a face was the result of shadowing and a low resolution camera.  Nature communicated a message without intent.  On May 28th, 585 BC, the Medes and Lydians battled in what is now Turkey.  The battle ended and both sides agreed to a truce when the soldiers saw a solar eclipse.  They interpreted the event as an omen from the gods, a sign that the gods did not condone the battle.  Now we know that eclipses are natural phenomena easily forecasted by the predictable orbits of the Moon and Earth.  Nature communicated a message without intent.  In July 1967, astronomer Jocelyn Bell noticed regular, well-defined pulses of radio waves coming from a small patch of the sky.  No natural source had ever been shown to produce such a signal, as it bore striking resemblance to man-made radio broadcasts.  Bell humorously called the source of the pulses Little Green Men-1, or LGM-1, as it appeared to be an attempt at communication from alien life forms.  In other words, a message.  People buzzed with excitement about receiving a message from extraterrestrials.  With further study, though, Bell found several more sources of similar radio pulses in the sky.  Astrophysicist Thomas Gold then found that the pulses were just a result of rapidly rotating neutron stars.  They were given the name pulsars.  Nature communicated a message without intent.  I could keep going, but do you see my point?  Those occurrences were all taken as messages by large numbers of people at some point.  Their existence has been explained, however, by natural forces.  Now that I've answered that question, will Turek get rid of the argument from DNA, as he calls it?  I hope so, because it's awful. ",

Turek, however, has been trying to answer the question of where DNA came from with nothing but theology, when the answer has been within the field of biology all along.  DNA naturally replicates in the production of a new life form.  In this process, most of its structure is copied perfectly, but there are often mistakes made, such as imperfect duplicate copies of certain base pairs.  Imperfect copies of previous organisms' DNA can lead to differences in gene expression within the larger organism.  Some of these mutations can prove beneficial in helping the organism survive longer and produce more offspring.  Then, those beneficial mutations are passed on to more offspring than differently mutated genes and preserved in future generations.  DNA sometimes adds new genes to itself without any intent.  Over a long enough period of time, DNA can change from rather short and simple to extremely long and complex.  We directly observe this happening, even today.  If you want to get more in depth on this, there are links in the description which will help you learn more.  So, Turek's smoking gun for intelligent design is a feature of the universe that's been studied so in depth that we know very well just how it forms and changes naturally.  Turek doesn't understand how DNA formed.  It looks complicated and impressive to him, so he settles with the answer of, God just made it, rather than studying the readily accessible scientific resources on the subject or simply being honest and humble in saying, I don't know.  In fact, this entire argument comes down to, I can't explain that naturalistically, so that proves God did it.  There's something that hasn't been explained, so God is invoked to fill that gap in our understanding.  That's what's called arguing for a god of the gaps.  It's a well-recognized fallacy and one which Turek knows about.  How do I know he knows it?  You'll see how in the ironic twist that is the ending of Turek's answer. ",

            "text": "Here's where the real irony comes in.  Turek bases his whole argument on naturalism hasn't explained it, so God must have done it, while poking fun at the natural law of the gaps fallacy.  Here's the thing, Turek.  DNA can and has been explained naturalistically.  You just don't know that because you're scientifically illiterate.  The difference between you, a Christian, and myself, an atheist, is that when we see something that we can't explain, you say, God did it, and I say, I don't know.  I don't ask that anyone assert that naturalism can explain everything.  All I ask is that when you don't know something, don't make up an unproven explanation so that you don't have to admit that you don't know.  Just admit ignorance and then research it from there.  That's the basis of intellectual honesty, and I hope the viewers of this video hold to that themselves.  I have really little hope for Turek, though, because as we've seen here, honesty is not his strong suit.  Thanks for watching.  I've been Drew of Genetically Modified Skeptic.
