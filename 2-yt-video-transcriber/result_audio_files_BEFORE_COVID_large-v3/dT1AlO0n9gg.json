            "text": "Yeah, you're digging around for all kinds of stuff.  I've granted you 10 times more than anybody should to make the point that you cannot reach a reasonable conclusion based on the information that it's more probable than not that I cheated because you cannot rule out the fact that I didn't cheat.  And as long as that remains a possibility, you can say, I suspect you cheated.  You're free to do that.  But you cannot reasonably conclude that it's more likely than not that I cheated.  until you have additional information.  Fair enough.  Same for God.  Until you demonstrate how likely a God is, how likely or how probable a God is as an explanation.  And the big mistake people make is a God is entirely consistent with everything.  Hey, God can serve as an explanation or an answer for anything.  It serves as an explanation for nothing because it doesn't tell you anything about how.  And so if somebody says, hey, I prayed because I was feeling down and I feel better.  You can't tell whether or not a God intervened.  There is no mechanism by which we can evaluate supernatural intervention at all.  And until there's such a mechanism where we can demonstrate it, you don't get to appeal to it as a possible or plausible explanation.  It's just something that's unfalsifiable that we can't rule out.  But when you look at it and you say, oh, it's really unlikely that this planet could have happened by natural means, no matter how unlikely it is, you have to be able to demonstrate that God is more likely even to make the claim that it probably was God.  And even if you could make the claim that it was probably God, you still haven't concluded that it's reasonable to conclude that it is God.  Because let's say we knew that, let's say, exactly half the time I deal fairly and the other half of the time I cheat.  Okay.  Let's say we know that that's the case, which is not something we don't know about a God.  If I deal you a good hand, you still don't know which of the 50% you're in.  And if you were to conclude that I likely cheated, you are factually incorrect because we've already defined it at 50-50.  But if you think that that's the case, that's what you think about it.  And what you think about it has no bearing on whether or not it's actually true.  And so when you tell somebody, I'm convinced that Matt cheated, and you've got a whole bunch of other people who are also convinced that you cheated, that doesn't make you any more right. ",
