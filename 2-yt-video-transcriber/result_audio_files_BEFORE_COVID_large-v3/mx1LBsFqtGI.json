            "text": "At this point, we've already heard two radically different creation stories.  But why stop there when you can spread a myth even further?  Introducing Adam and Eve and a talking snake.  Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made.  He said to the woman, Did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?  the woman said to the serpent we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden but god did say you must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden and you must not touch it or you will die.  a serpent spoke to eve And Eve's response wasn't, What the f... It was to answer the serpent's question like nothing weird was happening.  How is that not the entire focus of this story?  And I know God said don't eat from that tree to Adam.  but he never said it to eve.  check the transcript.  she should get a pass.  why is eve even afraid of death?  death doesn't even exist yet that's not for another few verses.  better not eat that snickers bar.  why what's wrong with snickers?  uh nothing yet.  I love how the verse says fruit.  I know we assume it's an apple, but the Bible didn't say apple.  It could be a pineapple, for all we know.  At least then it would make sense why you shouldn't take a bite of it.  You will not certainly die, the serpent said to the woman, for God knows that when you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.  That has to be the oldest version of someone being red-pilled.  You're gonna finally understand, Eve.  How gullible is Eve, by the way?  She's about to take advice from a stranger.  A stranger who's not even of her species.  And that's not even a convincing argument.  I mean, at least strangers who try to lure kids into a white van will say there's candy inside.  The serpent's only argument is, I know God gave you one rule to follow, but come on!  You know, the Bible never actually says that Eve died.  Who knows?  Maybe she's still around somewhere, telling people what to eat.  When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.  She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.  Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked.  So they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.  Sharing is caring.  Unless you're Eve, in which case sharing is the worst possible thing you could have done.  Way to teach a great moral lesson there, God.  Think about Everything Eve gets blamed for here.  According to the myth, she's responsible for breaking God's rule.  But really she ate some fruit, a pineapple, thought it was tasty, then offered it to someone else, all because it made her wiser.  In every other context, That's a really sweet, generous thing to do.  But she's demonized forever because of it.  If you suddenly had knowledge of good and evil, why would the first thing you think of be, I'm not wearing any clothes?  That's not knowledge of good or evil.  That's just knowledge.  Wouldn't the first thing Eve says be, Serpent!  What the hell did you do?  And why are you talking?  And if you notice evil now, isn't it fair to blame God for putting evil into the world?  You didn't cause it.  You only noticed it.  Don't blame Eve for having knowledge of evil.  Blame the God who created evil.  In Genesis 2, by the way, God told Adam that if he ate from that tree, he would die.  That's also what Eve said to the serpent.  And yet these two eat the fruit, and they seem to be doing just fine.  Their first thought isn't, oh no, a heart attack, but rather, I see your privates.  Let's make some underwear out of leaves.  They don't die anytime soon, either.  Adam lives for nearly another thousand years.  And Eve never dies.  God is such a liar.  By not following through on his threat, he is giving people a reason to sin more.  Also, I understand not wanting to be naked, but if the only person who sees you naked is your life partner, the only other person in existence, it's not that weird.  It's not that shameful.  I mean, I get the self-consciousness, but rushing to cover themselves up?  They could wait, is all I'm saying.  Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.  But the Lord God called to the man, Where are you?  He's walking in the garden, just... taking a stroll.  Forget guy in the sky.  Forget a Holy Spirit.  He's just a dude with a Fitbit.  Or apparently a single dad looking for his kids in the grocery store.  And Adam and Eve hid among the trees so God doesn't see them?  He's God!  I thought he was omniscient.  What is he doing?  asking where they are?  What sort of biblical hide-and-seek game is this?  If a psychic asks you, what's the weather like outside?  Your alarm bells should be going off since she should already know.  He answered, I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked.  So I hid.  Adam, God could already see you naked.  God created you naked.  God can find you anywhere.  That's how God works.  Do you seriously think God doesn't already know what you did?  And how did he hear God's arrival?  Was God just singing to himself?  What if God?  And he said, Who told you that you were naked?  Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?  Who taught you about being naked?  That's creepy talk from God, who apparently was getting away with voyeurism until now.  If Adam and Eve knew nothing about nakedness, what exactly would God be doing?  Also, yes, of course Adam ate from the tree.  He was offered a gift from his wife.  Do you know how much drama there would've been if Eve said, Try this.  I got it for you.  It cost me everything.  And her husband said, Nah.  I'm good.  He would be in so much trouble.  If God weren't single, maybe he would understand.  The man said, The woman you put here with me, she gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it.  Adam is already throwing his wife under the bus.  One of the first human's first acts is to blame a woman for something he did.  God should have created Adam, Eve and a marriage counselor.  Also, the woman you put here with me?  She's your wife!  She has a name!  What man talks about his partner by referring to her as the woman?  Even Bill Clinton followed that woman with her actual name.  Then the Lord God said to the woman, What is this you have done?  The woman said, The serpent deceived me and I ate.  These people blame everyone but themselves.  Did the serpent really deceive her, though?  The serpent said she wouldn't die if she ate the fruit.  Pineapple.  And she didn't.  He said, your eyes will be opened.  And they were.  The serpent's the only honest person in this group.  So the Lord God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals.  You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.  And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers.  He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.  Is the serpent really cursed, though?  I mean, I've seen nature documentaries.  The snake seems to fend for itself pretty well.  It doesn't just eat dust.  It eats the other wild animals, which means God cursed them a hell of a lot more.  God cursed that serpent for all the days of your life.  If I have this straight, it means Adam and Eve are supposed to receive the death penalty for eating the fruit, but the snake who gave it to Eve gets to keep living.  Damn!  The justice system was broken even back then.  Also, if the serpent is now on its belly, what on earth did it look like before?  I mean, just imagining that freaks me out.  There are some Christian racists out there who make a big deal out of this verse.  They think the serpent and Eve had sex, had a baby named Cain, and that his bloodline is what created non-whites and Jews.  It's a fringe belief, no doubt, but it shows you that bad people can use just about anything in a holy book to justify their bigotry.  Oh, God cursed a talking snake?  Oh yeah, that's totally about white power.  Maga.  To the woman, he said, I will make your pains in childbearing very severe.  With painful labor you will give birth to children.  Your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you.  What sort of weird punishment is that?  He could have given her a timeout or a scarlet letter or said, I'm gonna make you bleed a lot every few weeks.  But instead, he went with painful childbirth.  Which is basically God saying, I'm just gonna sandwich the joy of sex and the joy of a newborn baby with some excruciating torture.  Given what God later did to Jesus, that actually makes sense.  God loves torture.  God loves torture so much that he's already told Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply.  Which, if he's now punishing childbirth, really means, I want to see you suffer.  A lot.  Does that mean that when a doctor gives a woman an epidural, he's defying the will of God?  I would love to know what God's plan for childbirth was before Eve ate the fruit.  Was it going to be painless?  Or at least less severe?  Was pregnancy just a month or two and you have the fetus and all the growth happens on the outside?  I mean, somebody, please explain this to me.  How does that threat even work to someone who's never given birth?  I'll make childbirth even more painful.  How do I even get pregnant?  Uh... I'll tell you when you're older.  And on top of that, God's saying men will rule over women, and women will like it?  Hasn't God made women suffer enough?  God, the original misogynist.  To Adam He said, Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you you must not eat from it, cursed is the ground because of you.  Through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.  it will produce thorns and thistles for you and you will eat the plants of the field by the sweat of your brow.  you will eat your food until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return Again, what was the alternative?  God made all those trees so Adam could eat their fruit, and now God's punishing Adam by saying those fruits are the only options available to him?  What else was on the menu?  What kind of threat is that anyway?  Eve, childbirth will be so painful you'll wish you were dead.  Adam, Eat fruit.  Why can't God just erase their memories or something?  I mean, when you make a mistake this early in a project, just start over.  Better to reboot than to let the program continue until, spoiler, you need to create a flood to kill off nearly everyone on the planet.  And think about why God is punishing Adam here.  It's for listening to his wife.  What sort of lesson is that?  God gave Adam a wife so he wouldn't be lonely.  And then he punished Adam for treating her like an equal.  How come God forgot to mention heaven in all of this?  Adam named his wife Eve because she would become the mother of all the living.  That makes no sense.  I'm gonna call you Eve because you're like the biblical Eve, which is you.  How does he know she's gonna become the mother of all the living?  It's just the two of them for now.  And since God is gonna genocide everyone but Noah's family out of existence soon, Noah's wife is a much better candidate for being the mother of all the living.  She is the real Eve.  The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.  Well, I guess that gift is supposed to make up for the torture.  Not exactly a fair trade.  Sucks to be the animals that God murdered to give them the garments of skin, though.  I created you, but this jerk ate a pineapple, so now you will be slaughtered.  Hope you enjoyed your four minutes of existence.  And the Lord God said, The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil.  He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the Tree of Life and eat and live forever.  So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been  taken.\".  Us?  Who's us?  Who does God keep talking to?  It's pretty messed up that God blocks them from eating from the Tree of Life.  Like, I poisoned you, but I won't allow you to drink the antidote.  Talk about cruel and unusual punishment.  And also, God said if you eat from the tree of knowledge, you'll die.  Adam and Eve did that, so why would it even matter if they ate from the immortality tree?  Which tree is superior here?  I mean, would they just nullify each other?  It's very confusing.  Okay, serious question.  What if they ate from the tree of immortality first, which God was fine with, and then ate from the forbidden tree of knowledge?  Would they live forever or die soon?  And why would an all-powerful God create a security hazard like the immortality tree?  I mean, that's just dumb.  Why is there even a tree of immortality?  You wouldn't need one until death existed.  And death doesn't exist until Eve eats that fruit.  So really, that tree of immortality assumes Eve is gonna do what Eve totally did.  So stop blaming her for sticking to God's game plan.  After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim.  and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the Tree of Life.  This is not very secure.  I mean, you can just, like, go around it.  If God was in possession of a flaming sword to keep Adam out, why didn't God just put it in front of the Tree of Wisdom so Eve wouldn't go near it?  And why would God even need a sword?  Why do you need a murder weapon when no one's at war?  How would Adam and Eve even know what it was?  I mean, they barely have fig leaves.  You think they understand weaponry?  It makes just as much sense to say, God secured the border with an AR-15, which he just had lying around the house for some reason.  And when did God create cherubim?  I don't remember them from Genesis 1 or 2.  This story makes no logical sense.  There was no Adam.  There was no Eve.  And there were no editors for anything in this book so far. ",
