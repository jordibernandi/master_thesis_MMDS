            "text": "5, 9, 10, 4, 3, 2, 1, 7.  7.  Hey.  Hey, Miss.  Why you got to be calling me out like that?  Hey, I didn't mean to call you.  But I haven't seen you in a while.  I saw your husband the other day.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm just kidding.  No, I haven't seen you in a while.  You guys had a call with a guy with a sign or something?  Yeah.  Oh, the white guy?  Yeah.  That's it.  All right.  How's it going, sir?  Good.  Good.  Do you have some ID?  I do, yes.  May I see it, please?  Am I being detained?  Well, I'm conducting an investigation.  Mm-hmm.  So during the course of an investigation, you're obligated to provide me your name and information.  Since you're conducting an investigation into my lawful, constitutionally protected activity.  I have no idea why I'm here.  I'm putting you on notice.  Mm-hmm.  that I'm engaged in lawful Constitution-protected activities in favor of the First Amendment.  Okay.  No ID for you.  No ID for me.  That's right.  So am I being detained?  Well, what are you doing here?  Well, it's really none of your business, personally.  Then why am I here?  You keep telling me.  Well, apparently you were doing something to cause riots here.  Was I?  What was I doing?  That's why I'm asking you.  I'm giving you an opportunity to dispel this.  I'm not going to answer any questions.  What are they saying now?  I'm upstairs making public records requests.  I sit outside of the sign that says Public City Hall.  And now I'm looking at public notices.  Okay, so you have no information.  I'm not going to give you any information.  I'm not suspected of a crime.  I'm not obligated to provide you with anything.  Am I being detained?  Well, we can go that route if you'd like.  Well, I'd rather not be detained.  Okay, and I would rather not detain you, and I would rather you go on your way, and for me to go on my way, and we could dispel this whole thing and get it done and over with if you just provide me some information.  My name is Jeff.  Joe.  what?  Jeff.  Jeff.  That's awesome.  Can I do services?  I'm sorry, you're with what?  Can I do services?  Pen.  Pen.  Can I do services?  View services?  News.  P-I-N-A-C.  Can I do services?  And, uh, I'm a games constitution detective.  Sure, sir.  Well, being a new service person, you should know that right now I'm only questioning you to conduct an investigation, which you're responsible as a citizen of the United States to dispel any services of that way.  The time that you invoke your rights is when you're under arrest and I'm interrogating you.  So right now I'm not arresting you and I'm not interrogating you.  Okay.  But right now that the city is asking that you leave, Yes.  Because apparently your sign, which is providing vulgar messages, and they have that right.  Yes.  It doesn't give you the right to use profanity and offend people.  So when a sign... Does that, then yes, they have that right.  So if they're asking me to leave, I'd rather not.  Okay, then we're going to go that way.  Okay, well, and I would rather you be cooperative in all this other nonsense.  You expect me to help you in an investigation against me.  Do you expect me to do that?  And you expect me to answer questions for you when all you're doing is giving me a hard time.  What's your name and badge number, and are you recording right now?  Yes, I am recording right now.  I'm going to make a public records request for that video, so make sure nothing happens to it.  You've been put on there just about that time.  Okay.  And you can go down to the police department and follow public records law to obtain a copy of that.  I understand.  Okay.  So why don't we just go ahead and get out of here so these people can go about their business.  I'd rather not.  I have a right to be here.  Well, I told you that they've asked you to leave.  You're denying my request and my demand for you to leave.  So you're demanding.  You went from a request to a demand.  Okay.  Well, you said that you would prefer not to.  Okay.  So it has gone to a demand.  Okay.  Okay, so you can leave now.  And I'm just asking, if I don't leave, what's going to happen?  You're going to be arrested.  I'll be arrested.  I'll leave.  I'm protesting your arrest.  Thank you.  So you're going to leave.  Oh, yeah, I'll leave.  Okay, very good.  The folks in front of us are friends.  Under one of their sheds, the rear of the business.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Sir, I told you inside that you were being trespassed, that you were being asked to leave.  Well, when you can come back and not offend people and cause problems, then you can come back.  It was already explained into you to us, Jeff.  Yeah, I know.  I was going to arrest him.  Where did he put his sign?  Did he like make a sign and stick it to the ground or something?  No, he's holding a sign that says, Fuck City Hall.  And then he refused to check in.  He refused to check in?  Yes.  You want to go ahead and get his information?  Do you have his information?  No, his information.  Do you have a text?  Is he all right out there?  Well, if he holds up that sign again.  Well, he's power walking that way.  So what did it have?  like make a sign and stick it in the ground or something or is he just holding a sign that says city hall?  yeah oh and then he refused to check in.  he refused to check in.  yes you want to go ahead and get his information.  do you have his information by chance or no?  Right out of papers in here.  Yeah.  What's your name?  It's Olin.  How do you spell it?  C-R-I-L-U-S.  Your birthday?  Security.  Yes, security.  What's a good phone number?  Already here for the city hall.  Okay.  No problem.  5-3-0.  5-3-0.  Big Bravo, INDS X2, we'll be 51 in 10-18.  Sanford, you need a case number in the screen or is it for a previous supplement?  It's a previous supplement.  And then she said, but you know, Linda said, I can do it right now, but it will take maybe three or six days.  Right.  But you know why I called the police?  Because they refused to check.  They didn't even have a hike.  What?  The sidewalk is made for walking, so he cannot stay in one place.  My understanding is the sidewalk is made for walking.  I guess he's probably just trying to get a reaction out of people, is my guess.  Yeah, no problem.  Okay.  This is one of these people who probably runs around wanting to get it on Google.  This is one of these people here who spoke to the 97.  I guess I'll just hang out out here then.  Huh?  I said, I guess I'll just hang out out here then for now.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know what I got.  I understand he's a public.  But, you know, he allowed to stop.  But, you know, the problem is, you know, refused to check in.  Yeah.  Everybody's got to check in when they go in that building, so.  That's fine.  I don't know where, I don't know where he went.  He didn't want that one.  Yeah.  So we finished the check-in.  Yeah.  303-579.  Go ahead, ma'am.  You can go to me first, thank you.  10-4.  All right.  You have a good one.  Okay, bud.  Okay, 48. ",
