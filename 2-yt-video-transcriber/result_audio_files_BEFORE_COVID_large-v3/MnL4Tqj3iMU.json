            "text": "You've heard this around here many times before, but we believe that gratitude is the single healthiest human emotion you can have.  And listen, I say this with a clear understanding that we don't live in a perfect nation, but we live in a great nation.  We live in a free nation.  How many love this great nation of ours?  And on 4th of July, as we celebrate the freedom that we have as a country, I want to do a couple of things.  One is I want to thank all of the brave men and women who have fought or keep fighting to keep this nation free.  We love all of you.  And sometimes we can get really, I don't know if you've noticed this, just everybody's a bit sensitive nowadays, right?  And easily offended.  And I'm not going to get on a whole thing about that, but it's sort of a bit of a superpower.  I'm trying, I'm trying.  It's a bit of a superpower if you can be unoffendable.  isn't it?  Can you imagine what that would feel like?  Just, I just can't be offended.  I just, I'm not affected by this or that or the other thing, but I just want to be a voice of reason.  I want to be a voice of calm.  I want to be a voice of peace.  I want to be a voice of help.  in this time in our great nation.  And church, we've got bright things in the future.  I truly believe that.  And it starts with the church.  It starts with Jesus' church, which is what we are here at Bayside.  This is Jesus' church.  So not only do we celebrate freedom as a nation, but we are free people in Christ.  As Christ followers, we're free.  We have a freedom that cannot be taken away by anything.  It's something we possess on the inside.  No one can take it from us.  So church, let's stand today.  Let's be full of gratitude that we are free people in Christ, but for the free nation that we live in, although it has its flaws.  We are a free people.  We can shout our faith from the rooftops without fear of retribution, without fear of imprisonment.  We can play as loud as we want.  Some of you are like, yeah, that's not such a great thing.  But we can shout it.  We can go share it.  We can talk about it because we live in this great nation.  So church, today, can we just forget the issues, forget the flaws, forget the things that might agitate us or offend us, and just focus on gratitude that we live in a great country where we are truly free.  Can we do that today?  I'm going to pray for us.  Let's pray together.  Lord, we are thankful.  We stand here today full of gratitude.  And Lord, we choose today to not focus on the things that bother us or the things that offend us.  But Lord, we choose to focus today on freedom.  Lord, many have lost their lives paying for the freedom that we enjoy in this country.  Many continue to risk their lives fighting for the freedom that we have in this country.  And Lord, this nation was founded on you.  Lord, let us hold fast to that truth today.  Let us never forget that we are a free people who live in a great nation.  So Lord, we love you and thank you for the blessing that it is to be an American.  We pray this in the name above every other name in the name of Jesus and everyone said together.  Amen.  Let's all stay standing.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
