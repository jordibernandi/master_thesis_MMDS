            "text": "My lords, shall we begin?  Law 24, play the perfect courtier.  The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity.  He has mastered the art of indirection.  He flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner.  Learn and apply the laws of courtiership, and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court.  a courtier is someone who attends a royal court as an adviser or companion to the king or queen.  to be a courtier was a dangerous game because they were often used as a scapegoat.  living the life of a courtier was like walking on a tight rope.  courtiers had to learn to master the balance between pleasing while not pleasing too much.  it was a dangerous game.  there are still plenty of people who believe the sun revolves around them.  the royal court may have more or less disappeared but courts and courtiers still exist because power still exists.  the thirteen rules of court politics the first one avoid trying to impress people.  it is never prudent to prattle on about yourself or call too much attention to your actions.  the more you talk about your deeds the more suspicion you cause.  you also stir up enough envy among your peers to induce treachery and backstabbing.  the second one practise nonchalance.  your talent must appear to flow naturally with an ease that makes people take you for a genius rather than a workaholic.  it is better for them to marvel at how gracefully you have achieved your accomplishment than to wonder why it took so much work.  the third one be frugal with flattery.  it may seem that your superiors cannot get enough flattery but too much of even a good thing loses its value.  it also stirs up suspicion among your peers.  learn to flatter indirectly.  the fourth one arrange to be noticed.  there is a paradox you cannot display yourself too brazenly yet you must also get yourself noticed.  this task requires much art.  it is often initially a matter of being seen in the literal sense.  pay attention to your physical appearance then and find a way to create a distinctive a subtly distinctive style and image.  the fifth one alter your style and language according to the person you are dealing with.  the pseudo belief in equality the idea that talking and acting the same way with everyone no matter what their rank makes you somehow a paragon of civilization is a terrible mistake.  those below you will take it as a form of condescension which it is and those above you will be offended although they may not admit it.  you must change your style and your way of speaking to suit each person.  number six never be the bearer of bad news.  the king kills the messenger who brings the bad news.  you must make sure that the lot of the bearer of bad news falls on a colleague.  never on you.  bring only good news and your approach will gladden your master.  the seventh one never affect friendliness and intimacy with your master.  he does not want a friend for a subordinate.  he wants a subordinate.  never approach him in an easy friendly way or act as if you were on best terms.  that is his prerogative.  if he chooses to deal with you on this level assume a wary friendship.  otherwise err in the opposite direction and make the distance between you clear.  number eight never criticise those above you directly but there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessary.  to say nothing or to give no advice would open you to risks of another sort.  you must learn then to couch your advice and criticism as indirectly and politely as possible.  think twice or three times before deciding you have made them sufficiently indirect.  ere on the side of subtlety and gentleness.  in ancient china the chinese emperor was considered more than a man.  he was a force of nature.  his kingdom was the center of the universe and everything revolved around him.  he embodied the world's perfection.  to criticize him or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order.  no minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slightest cautionary word.  but the emperors were only human and the kingdom suffered greatly by their mistakes.  inserting sightings of strange phenomena in the court chronicles was the only way to warn them.  the emperor would read of geese flying backwards and moons out of orbit and realize that he was being cautioned.  his actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to change.  for chinese courtiers the problem of how to give the emperor advice was an important issue.  over the years thousands of them had died trying to warn or counsel their master.  their criticisms had to be made indirect.  the chronicles were their solution.  identify no one person as the source of criticism.  make the advice as impersonal as possible but let the emperor know the gravity of the situation.  your master is no longer the scent of the universe but he still imagines that everything revolves around him.  when you criticize him he only sees the person criticizing not the criticism itself.  like the chinese courtiers you must find a way to disappear behind the warning.  use symbols and other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come without putting your neck on the line.  number nine be frugal in asking those above you for favors.  Nothing irritates a master more than having to reject someone's request.  It stirs up guilt and resentment.  Ask for favours as rarely as possible and know when to stop.  Most importantly, do not ask for favours on another person's behalf, least of all a friend's.  10.  Never joke about appearances or taste.  A lively wit and a humorous disposition are essential qualities for a good courtier.  and there are times when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging.  but avoid any kind of joke about appearances or taste.  to highly sensitive areas especially with those above you.  do not even try it.  when you are away from them you will dig your own grave.  number eleven do not be the court cynic.  express admiration for the good work of others.  if you constantly criticise your equals or subordinates some of that criticism will rub off on you hovering over you like a grey cloud.  wherever you go people will groan at each new cynical moment and you will irritate them.  By expressing modest admiration for other people's achievements, you paradoxically call attention to your own.  12.  Be self-observant.  The mirror is a great invention.  You must visualize mirrors everywhere, training your mind to try and see yourself as others see you.  Are you acting too submissive?  Are you trying too hard to please?  Do you seem desperate for attention?  Be observant about yourself and you will avoid a mountain of dangers.  number thirteen be a source of pleasure.  this is critical.  it is an obvious law of human nature that we will flee what's unpleasant and distasteful while charm and the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame.  make yourself the flame and you will rise to the top.  Not everyone can play the role of the favourite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit, but we can all control our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessary.  A man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes and of his face.  He is profound, impenetrable.  He dissimulates bad officers, smiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disguises his passions, belies his heart, and speaks and acts against his feelings. ",
