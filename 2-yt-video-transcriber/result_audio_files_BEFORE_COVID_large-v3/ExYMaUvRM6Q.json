            "text": "Hello.  Welcome to Connecting the Dots on my YouTube channel.  I'm Dr.  Claude Anderson, your host.  Here again, to bring some facts to you and somehow explain a lot of the issues that pertain to black folk from a historical standpoint up until the present time.  Let's use one thing.  Let's talk about something that's very popular in American society, but most people don't understand what they're talking about when they bring it up.  It's about race matters and what is race and what is racism.  And I've yet to find very many people that know.  As a matter of fact, at one time, I used to go around the world and I would offer to give people $100 if they could tell me what racism was.  And do you know, invariably, I couldn't find one person that could explain what racism was because they use the definitions that are being perpetuated by the dominant white society.  But let's find out what racism and track it.  Let's go back in history now.  See, if you go back in history, let's go back to about the 1450s as an instance.  In about 1450, there was... There was no such thing as a race.  What they had in those days, they had tribes, they had religious groups, and they had nations.  That was it.  Those three things, tribes, nations, and religions.  But there was no such thing as race.  But about 1445 to 1450, that particular time, a guy named Henry the Navigator went off the coast of Africa.  And he picked up about 16 Blacks.  and took them back to Portugal and to Italy.  And he got back there, he gave them to the Catholic Church as a gift and suggested they can use them however they saw fit.  And they used the Catholic Church, the reason they gave them to the Catholic Church, you see, because prior to that time, the Catholic Church sort of played the role of being an advocate and a consoler for people who were slaves.  Because to be a slave in that time, you know, you had, again, as I said, be persecuted for being either for indebtedness or for religious persecution or a victim of a war, a prisoner of war.  And so the Catholic church is playing the role of being a great consoler, come in and comfort you.  And so when Henry the Navigator gave those 16 blacks to the Catholic church at about 1445, 1450, they kept them and used them.  What we do, we use them as slaves, as servants in the Catholic church.  And they use them in that role from about 1445, 1450 up until about 1488.  And in 1488, a guy named Pope Innocence, he says, you know, we found out over this 47-year period, you know, having these Blacks around, that's a good thing because we never had them before.  As I said before, to be a slave, you had to be either indebted to someone or religiously being persecuted or prisoner of war.  But these were neither of those things.  So they said, well, this is a good thing.  And so at that point in time, they injected the word race into the, race popped up.  Not necessarily at that point, but around that point.  And by saying, okay, what we're going to do now is just use them in any capacity we could.  Then about four or five years later, Henry the Navigator, after Henry the Navigator gave all these things to the Catholic Church, Columbus sailed around the world in hopes of finding new land and valuables and golds.  As a matter of fact, he even found dope and sugar.  And he ran into a continent over here called North America, North American continent.  He landed there.  And then, and they found out that it was pretty much uninhabited, except a few, about maybe 100, 100, 200 thousands at max Indians running around the land.  And it was pretty much uninhabited.  He went back to Europe.  And so by the early 1500s, it was a major effort, things going on across the world.  And starting in Europe, they were suffering from famine, diseases, food shortages, and crime.  And they needed to do something to resuscitate the entire European continent.  And they were looking for hope.  So when Columbus came back and said, I found all this land and it's uninhabited, that's when racism started right there.  It picked up going all the way back to Henry the Navigator up to this point.  Racism started at that point.  How did it start?  Because then they said, you know what?  We need to go inhabit that land.  and try to use it.  that has value.  But how are we going to do it?  People say, well, remember what Pope Innocent said back in 1887, I mean in 1487, let's use those people called blacks, use them as a labor class.  And we're going to change the whole concept of how to get wealth and power and save this continent.  The entire European continent was going down the toilet.  It's what we do then, we combine things.  Instead of being practicing mercantilism, as we've been using, doing up to this point in time, Let's come up with a new concept.  And when you can own and control, get the land, get the tools and the resources and use someone else's labor and enrich yourself, that becomes capitalism.  And that's where the concept of capitalism started.  But let's go back to the concept about race.  So a race started.  Nine European nations, Italy, France, Germany, the rest of them said they got into a race.  So let's try to see who can be the first one to get over in those countries to North America, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean and use black labor to enrich ourselves.  They were in a race, a race to develop wealth and power by going and extracting the resources out of America or owning and controlling the land and the tools and using black labor to enrich themselves.  That's where race came.  That was a race.  A race is a contest.  They began to compete.  That's why you heard me say on a number of occasions before, learning how to compete.  And as they began to compete as nations, they competed from about the early 1500s all the way up until about 1857, around the eve of the Civil War.  And that's when the race ended.  The race ended, that was a 300 year, the race ended then.  You know why it ended?  Because at that point in time, those European nations who had all pitched in together, as well as some Asian nations and Latin Americans, they pitched in together to exploit black labor.  And all the resources have been transferred into the hands of non-blacks.  And the race was over in 1859.  And when the race ended, they took the E off of race and stuck a suffix called ISM, which means sustained and hold on to the prevailing conditions.  At that particular time in 1859, Whites own almost 99% of everything in America.  And black slaves own practically nothing.  You had about almost four and a half to five million slaves, but they own practically nothing.  And the only people, and the few blacks that had gotten something was, you had about 200 some thousand blacks that were free.  Collectively, they had one half or 1% of anything of value.  At that point in 1859, the race ended.  And they took the E off of race and stuck the suffix ISM.  That's where racism came from.  It had nothing to do with minorities and poor folk and people of color.  It had to do strictly with black people and whites, which means all the wealth and resources and land, ownership, rights, privileges, businesses, income, all have been transferred into the hands of the dominant white society.  And consequently, from that point on, whites would only control everything in the country.  And that was what racism was.  And anytime black folk asked for anything, for reparations or affirmative action or any preferential treatment, anything, you sort of be in an opposition to it.  Whites and their sub-ethnics were to oppose anything that would allow the conditions of black folk to change.  Whites were in 1859 on the eve of the Civil War.  Whites in America, they were 100-foot giants and black folk were one-foot midgets to make sure they owned and controlled nothing, had no power and resources.  And that's where racism came from.  has remained unchanged up until this time.  But what's happening now, to keep black folk confused, they want to pretend that racism also is the same as bias, bigotry, hatred, personal attitudes, or discrimination.  Those things have nothing to do with, everybody discriminates.  Even in a family, you can discriminate, you can have five kids and discriminate between them.  That has nothing to do with racism.  And see, black folk must learn that, understand that black people can never be racist.  all they can do in america is react to white racism.  blacks don't have the power to enslave jim crow segregate or mistreat anybody in america.  racism is an issue between blacks and whites.  it has nothing to do with language groups or culture groups or other groups coming to america.  it is our gays a midget.  it has to do with black people blacks and whites and so now that you understand racism be on the guard.  Don't let anybody use those terms in front of you to confuse it and mix it with things that don't attain the black folk.  White folks started misusing the word race after 1959 and told black folk it has to do with how you feel about somebody and whether you like them or not.  Racism started off as an economic issue between blacks and whites.  It is still an economic issue between blacks and whites.  Now, as you know, go forward, produce wealth and power for our people.  Take care, and I'll see you next week.  on connecting the dots.  This is Dr.  Claude Anderson signing off. ",
