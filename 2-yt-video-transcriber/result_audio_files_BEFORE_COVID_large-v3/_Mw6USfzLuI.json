A police vehicle is either going to bring a victim or a witness to identify this guy and claim he is either the right guy or not the right guy.  Filled show-ups are notorious producing innocent suspects that go to jail.  The only people that ever checked me in the past has been the police.  So besides the information on field show-ups and ultimately the outcome of this incident, I'm sharing with you the difference between a GoPro 6 camera and a Sony 4K handheld camera.  To do this kind of work, really, we need both.  Like I individually need both cameras.  So the reason I bring up the cameras is because Laura's recently broke.  If you enjoy her videos, if you watch her channel, I'm going to put a link at the top for you to check them out and maybe you could help her out. ",
