            "text": "Regulation is supposed to exist to protect consumers, workers, or the environment.  But some regulations mostly just protect existing businesses.  From what?  From competition.  It's not rare to see businessmen embrace regulation.  Why?  Because regulations often serve as barriers to entry.  Barriers to entry exist in most industries.  The lower the barriers, the easier it is for new small businesses to come onto the scene.  Regulations are a major barrier in many industries.  When new rules pop up, established businesses are fine, but new businesses will find it very tough to get in.  For instance, when food trucks started to blossom in cities around the country, politicians in places like Chicago, El Paso, or Grand Rapids passed or preserved regulations to limit the truck's ability to operate downtown.  Some of the proposed rules directly involved food safety, but many rules were nakedly efforts to protect restaurants from competition.  We wanted this ordinance in place to help establish restaurants keep their business. ",

For every business killed or curtailed by unnecessary regulation, there are a dozen more victims, businesses that never come to be.  These are hidden victims of regulation.  It's hard to count them because their business has never failed.  They were blocked from ever coming into being.  But there's another victim, public safety.  By killing competition, some regulations actually make the public less safe.  Let's take an issue related to food trucks.  The 2009 Federal Food Safety Modernization Act.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have noted, \"...an increasingly centralized food supply means that a food contaminated in production can be rapidly shipped to many states, causing a widespread  outbreak.\".  All of the above costs of protective regulation add up to less choice for consumers, more costs to small businesses, less competition as some businesses are kept out, and more risk to the public.  This adds up to a slower economic growth.  Thus, the fifth victim of this sort of regulation is the economy.  So next time you hear someone say, this regulation is even supported by business, realize that it's supported by some businesses who are profiting at the expense of everyone else.  And those are the victims of cronyism. ",
