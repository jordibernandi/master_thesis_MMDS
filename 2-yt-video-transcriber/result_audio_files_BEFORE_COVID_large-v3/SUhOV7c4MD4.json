He knows that we're on borrowed time and that we're headed for a day of reckoning.  He just looks back to the Great Depression and says, oh, it'll be like that, right, where we had deflation.  But during the 1930s, we were on a gold standard.  It was very different.  The Fed couldn't just print money back then.  Money was gold.  And Roosevelt devalued the dollar, but it was still backed by gold.  And it went from the dollar bought 20 ounces, or you could buy, $20 could get you an ounce of gold before the Depression.  And then when Roosevelt devalued, you then needed $35 to get an ounce of gold.  But still, that was a limit.  And had Roosevelt not done that, prices would have fallen even more than they did.  But prices fell.  And asset prices, of course, fell more than the price of goods.  What Dent doesn't understand is that when you're on a fiat system and you could just create money at will out of thin air without any discipline, that when all these bad things start to happen that Dent is forecasting, the Fed's just going to print more and more money.  According to Dent, basically the Fed is going to default on all its promises.  The Fed is not going to pay bondholders their money.  The Treasury is going to tell people that have bank accounts, when their banks fail, oh, the FDIC doesn't have any money, so you just lost your deposits.  According to Dent, the government is going to tell people on Social Security, we're out of money, sorry, you don't get any.  We don't really have anything in the trust funds.  It was all a lie.  And so I know we promised you Social Security, but we just can't make the payments.  See, I don't believe that that's what's going to happen.  See, what I believe is that they're going to pay everybody.  They're just going to create all the money that they need.  So it's not a debt default that we're going to have.  It's appreciation of the currency.  And so if Harry Dent thinks he's going to take refuge in the US dollar, he's got another thing coming.  I mean, the dollar is going to be the biggest casualty of this whole thing.  I mean, because when you borrow more money than you can repay, which Dent would acknowledge, Default is inevitable.  The only question is, how will they default?  Will they default honestly by just not paying or dishonestly by printing?  Dense debt is they just don't pay.  My bet is that they print. ",

I mean, the Fed looks at their job as being the cheerleaders for the economy, to kind of talk it up and pretend everything is great.  I mean, even Ben Bernanke let the cat out of the bag when he was questioned on a radio interview by, I think it was, I forget the name, Motley Fool or something like that.  But this was well after the financial crisis.  He was no longer Fed chairman.  And they played back some of his clips from 07, where he said everything was great, subprime was contained, nothing to worry about, right?  Housing is... And they played the clips and they said, hey, you know, how do you feel now when we play this back, knowing how wrong you were?  I mean, how do you feel about these statements?  And instead of saying, I feel like a fool, he basically said, well, you know, I couldn't exactly be honest back then.  I couldn't exactly state my real opinion because I was part of the administration, which he wasn't.  But he basically acknowledged, look, my job was to say good things and to try to make sure that nobody was worried.  to try to be the voice of calm, to reassure everybody that there was nothing to worry about.  Well, and so if basically that's what the Fed does, how can you believe anything that they say?  Because they're going to say everything is great, no matter how bad they think it is, because they're afraid.  if they actually come out and say, oh, yeah, this is, we're headed for, that they're going to cause a crisis, that they're going to, it's like they're going to cause the very crisis that they're worried about happening.  So they're hoping if they could just put a positive spin on it, they can at least delay the onset.  But, you know, the problem with that is the longer they delay it, the worse they make it.  But for them, it's a victory just to delay it because they have a very short term time horizon.  They're just looking towards the end of their term or the next presidential election.

I feel as if people got, they bought this myth that the Fed was tightening, which they talked a lot about tightening, never really tightened that much.  Why do you think the metals declined so much?

            "text": "Well, they tightened by removing some of the ease, but they never got to, you know, restrictive monetary policy.  They just got to a monetary policy that was less stimulative, right?  less accommodative than it was before.  And that was enough.  Like if you get a drug habit, you're like hooked on heroin and all of a sudden you get less heroin, you're still getting drugs, but you're not getting enough and your body needs a certain amount.  And so that's kind of what happened.  We went into withdrawal When the Fed started to taper and when they started to raise interest rates, we started going to withdrawal because even though we were getting cheap money, it wasn't cheap enough.  And the reason that gold stopped rising, it got up to 1900 in 2011.  And the reason it went up there was because people were worried, rightly so, about where the Fed was headed with quantitative easing and 0% rates.  But the Fed was able, I guess to its credit, or not really its credit because we're going to suffer from that, but it was able to con everybody into thinking that their policy worked, that all they had to do was normalize interest rates and shrink their balance sheet.  But I was pointing out that that's the hard part.  It's like anybody can get hooked on drugs.  The hard part is quitting the habit.  But the Fed convinced everybody that it worked.  And even though the balance sheet was still $4.5 trillion, and even though interest rates were still zero, the Fed claimed victory.  And everybody believed them.  And so gold went down and the dollar went up because the market started to anticipate all the rate hikes to get back to normal.  They anticipated the Fed shrinking its balance sheet back down to pre-crisis levels.  But that never happened.  And I was saying for years that it was never going to happen.  But now that the Fed is cutting rates again, they gave up trying to normalize rates, because it's impossible to do it.  They gave up shrinking their balance sheet, and now they're expanding it again.  And so when people realize that there is no exit strategy, there is no way out, that it is QE infinity, that interest rates have to stay near zero forever, or maybe even go negative, Because the longer they keep rates low, the more debt we have.  And the more debt we have, the lower rates have to be to afford it.  What we really need is debt default.  We need to get rid of all this debt.  We need to be restructured.  But the government doesn't want that.  They want to maintain the debt.  But in doing that, they encourage even more debt.  So the debt bubble gets bigger and bigger and bigger.  And now you need even cheaper money to sustain it.  So when the markets realize that this is it, we're in for good, There's no shrinking of the balance sheet.  It's going to grow in perpetuity.  That rates stay down.  That means inflation is going to run rampant.  And the dollar is a bottomless pit.  And so all of that hope is going to vanish.  And all those rate hikes that the markets were expecting are going to be priced out.  And the dollar is going to go through the floor.  And gold is going to go through the roof. ",

            "text": "Yeah, it seems like we're reaching that point.  Again, you touched on Bernanke.  I love that quote where he said we could raise rates in 15 minutes, which you could, but never did and never would have.  So Peter, again, I know we're wrapping up at the end of the conference, so we'll let you run, but I think I'm personally grateful.  I know you've opened a lot of eyes in seeing these things where Austrian economics is getting out there and you've really played a large role in that.  So thank you for that.  And perhaps again, just wrapping up, you can let folks know how they can find you. ",

            "text": "companies and uh yeah well first of all for social media.  i mean i i do the podcast the peter schiff show.  you can listen to it on itunes the shift radio.com.  i put it up on my youtube channel.  uh but so listen to those i do a couple a week.  usually sometimes they're close to an hour a piece.  so i comment on a lot of things not just the markets but politics and and other things that are on my mind.  And you get a perspective that you don't generally get from the mainstream media.  In fact, I used to make regular appearances on the mainstream media.  And a few years ago, everybody kind of cut me off because they wanted to keep my perspective off their air.  But I think more people now hear it indirectly, you know, through social media than used to hear it on, you know, more conventional.  But, you know, I've been tweeting a lot recently, so you can follow me on Twitter.  Peter Schiff, you know, you'll see my, I got like 172,000 followers.  I don't have a verification check, so.  But that's the one that's me.  I am verified on my Facebook page.  So you can go to my Facebook page.  And again, subscribe.  I got about 270,000 subscribers to my YouTube channel.  So I'm out there.  I'm putting out that content.  But if you've got money and you want to preserve the value of that money, if you don't want to be collateral damage when this bubble pops, you need to get some gold.  I have a gold company, Ship Gold, as you said.  You can buy gold.  Goldmoney.com is another great way to open up an online account and have money that you can actually use as a medium of exchange.  When it hits the fan and merchants want to be paid in gold, you want to have an app where you can conduct commerce in gold.  So set up a gold money account.  But if you have larger sums of money and you want to have a portfolio that I can manage, assets around the world and good stocks and the most solid currencies in the best countries, come to my website at Europe Pacific Capital.  Call us up.  Speak to one of my representatives about setting up an account for me to manage. ",
