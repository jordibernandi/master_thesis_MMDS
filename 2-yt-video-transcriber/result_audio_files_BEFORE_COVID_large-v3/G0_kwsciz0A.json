            "text": "All right, so there's a clip going around the internet right now.  Some of y'all have probably seen it.  It's from East Tennessee, my old stomping grounds.  All right, and look, East Tennessee's a complicated place, okay?  I mean, first of all, Knoxville's a college town, you know, tend to be more liberal.  When I lived there, our mayor was a Hispanic woman.  Now it's a mute, soulless, demonic pro wrestler, and that's not a joke, but we don't have to get into that right now.  The main downtown strip of Knoxville is called Gay Street, y'all.  I mean, like most southern cities, it's a blue dot in a sea of red, right?  There's a lot of progressive people there, but, you know, you get too far outside the city and... But I also want y'all to understand, for a lot of people in East Tennessee, this is a time of desperation and despair right now.  These people are having their very way of life threatened by forces beyond their control.  I'm talking, of course, about the past 10 years of college football.  I'm dead inside.  No, but with all that said, let's just get into the clip, all right?  This is a severe county commissioner.  It's between Knoxville and the Smoky Mountains.  Here we go.  Oh, man, that really takes me back there.  Grew up having those conversations with those dipshits.  This is a true story.  I've always remembered this.  2004, I'm working a summer job at the Clay County Highway Department.  The election's coming up, and another old boy that worked there asked me who I was going to vote for.  And I said, well, I'm probably going to vote for Kerry, you know.  And the dude looked at me dead serious and goes, but, but, Trey, uh, Kerry's for queers.  And I was just like, yeah, no, I know.  But, you know, George Bush is a grossly incompetent, fear mongering war criminal who is a daily global scale embarrassment.  So I swear the dude, again, completely seriously just goes, yeah, OK, OK, sure.  But but but someone carries for queers.  I'm actually kind of grateful for this part of the video because it answers a question I've had lately.  I've thought for a minute that Mayor Pete is an interesting thought experiment for these people because where do they fall?  How do they reconcile supporting the troops with hating the queers?  where Mayor Pete is concerned?  If you hate the queer part more than the troop part, does that mean you don't support the troops enough?  Because obviously Jesus can't have that.  But if you support the troop part more than you hate the queer part, does that mean you don't hate the queers enough?  Because Jesus don't want that either.  So, like, what do you do?  And I thank this guy for clearing that up.  But this old boy was just getting started, though.  I'm not afraid.  By God, there's a lot, a lot of male in this country has very few rights.  And they're getting tucked forever.  Okay, seriously, what rights can he even possibly be referring to other than, like, the right to say the N-word at the bank?  Or the right to assault a minor as long as he's a homo?  What else could he even mean?  This guy has gotten to do whatever he wanted to do his entire life, but he feels persecuted because our side lets women talk on TV or whatever?  Fuck this dipshit.  Right now, you might be thinking there's no possible way you and this dude could ever see eye to eye on anything, right?  Ever.  What if I told you he actually ends this little tirade with a statement that pretty much every liberal on earth would agree wholeheartedly with?  You don't believe me?  Here we go.  What?  I don't even, I don't, I can't even process these people.  I don't know how it's possible to be so prophetic and so oblivious at the exact same time.  They defy all logic, man.  And I mean like literally, they literally defy logic because it scares and confuses them and Bible says it's a sin and shit.  And lastly, listen, if you're feeling disheartened by the response you hear from the crowd in that video, A couple things, okay?  First of all, you gotta realize what the demographic is for a county commissioner's meeting in Sevier County.  I mean, that room was already full of other William Roberts and Lemuels who were exactly like that guy.  Of course you're gonna agree with everything he says, you know?  But also, not everyone there was on board.  One woman stood up, expressed her anger, and said this as she stormed out.  God damn right, darling.  That's what I'm talking about.  Listen, I got a message for you.  I believe her name is Sarah.  Sarah, if you haven't already and you ever want to, come see one of my shows in Knoxville or something.  You can be my guest anytime, all right?  But for the rest of y'all, I wanted to end on that clip, a homegirl there, because it's important to me that you understand, please, that this does not represent all of East Tennessee, this video.  It doesn't even represent all of Sevier County.  You know who else is from Sevier County?  Her Royal Highness and Goddess Emperor of all Tennessee, kind Miss Dolly Parton.  You know, the woman who's been out there being an unabashedly, unapologetically, open-minded, open-armed, white-trash, hillbilly, artistic genius for half a century.  Yeah.  So when you think of Sevier County, don't think of this dipshit.  Think of Dolly, okay?  Please.  I love y'all. ",
