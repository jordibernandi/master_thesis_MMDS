            "text": "Why was Jesus of Nazareth crucified?  Because he made outrageous claims about himself.  He claimed to be the one and only Son of God.  Why would anyone take his claim seriously?  Well, that all depends.  If Jesus actually rose from the dead, then his claim to be God's unique Son carries considerable weight.  On the other hand, if the resurrection never actually happened, then Jesus may be safely dismissed as just another interesting but tragic historical figure.  Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?  As we explore this question, we need to address two further questions.  What are the facts that require explanation?  And which explanation best accounts for these facts?  There are three main facts that need to be explained.  The discovery of Jesus' empty tomb, the appearances of Jesus alive after his death, and the disciples' belief that Jesus rose from the dead.  Let's examine each of these.  Fact number one.  The discovery that Jesus' tomb was empty is reported in no less than six independent sources, and some of these are among the earliest materials to be found in the New Testament.  This is important because when an event is recorded by two or more unconnected sources, historians' confidence that the event actually happened increases, and the earlier these sources are dated, the higher their confidence.  Moreover, the Gospels indicate that it was women who first discovered that Jesus' body was missing.  This is likely historical because in that culture a woman's testimony was considered next to worthless.  A later legend or fabrication would have had men make this discovery.  Our confidence in the empty tomb is further increased by the response of the Jewish authorities.  When they heard the report that the tomb was found empty, they said that Jesus' followers had stolen his body, thereby admitting that Jesus' tomb was, in fact, empty.  Most scholars, by far, hold firmly to the reliability of the biblical statements about the empty tomb.  Fact number two.  The appearances of Jesus alive after his death.  In one of the earliest letters in the New Testament, Paul provides a list of witnesses to Jesus' resurrection appearances.  He appeared to Peter, then to the Twelve.  Then he appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time.  Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.  Finally, he appeared also to me.  Furthermore, various resurrection appearances of Jesus are independently confirmed by the Gospel accounts.  On the basis of Paul's testimony alone, virtually all historical scholars agree that various individuals and groups experienced appearances of Jesus alive after His death.  it may be taken as historically certain that Peter and the disciples had experiences after Jesus' death in which Jesus appeared to them as the risen Christ.  After Jesus' crucifixion, his followers were devastated, demoralized, and hiding in fear for their lives.  As Jews, they had no concept of a Messiah who would be executed by his enemies, much less come back to life.  The only resurrection Jews believed in was a universal event on Judgment Day after the end of the world, not an individual event within history.  Moreover, in Jewish law, Jesus' crucifixion as a criminal meant that he was literally under God's curse.  Yet somehow, despite all of this, the disciples suddenly and sincerely came to believe that God had raised Jesus from the dead.  They were so completely convinced that, when threatened with death, not one of them recanted.  Even the Pharisee Paul, who persecuted Christians, suddenly became a Christian himself.  as did Jesus' sceptical younger brother, James.  Some sort of powerful, transformative experience is required to generate the sort of movement earliest Christianity was.  That is why, as an historian, I cannot explain the rise of early Christianity unless Jesus rose again, leaving an empty tomb behind him.  These three firmly established facts cry out for an adequate explanation.  How do you make sense of them?  Down through history, various naturalistic explanations have been offered to explain away these facts.  The conspiracy hypothesis, the apparent death hypothesis, the hallucination hypothesis, and so on.  All of these have been nearly universally rejected by contemporary scholarship.  The simple fact is that there is just no plausible naturalistic explanation of these three facts.  The explanation given by the original eyewitnesses is that God raised Jesus from the dead.  If it's even possible that God exists, then that explanation cannot be ruled out.  For a God who is able to create the entire universe, the odd resurrection would be child's play.  An empty tomb.  Jesus' appearances alive after his death, and a group of dejected followers suddenly transformed by a radical new belief in a risen Messiah.  These are independently established historical facts.  How do you explain them? ",
