I did feel at times that I might have been a little bit condescending to Nathan Thomson, so I want to apologise to him for that.  I did insinuate that if he was going to argue that thermodynamics meant that we couldn't have an atmosphere next to the vacuum of space, That he should have an understanding of thermodynamics.  I think I thoroughly exposed.  he didn't know what he was talking about.  And when we were talking about Polaris in the sky, I did argue that if he had a basic understanding of geometry, then he would understand the argument.  And I did at one point say that trigonometry in our country is something we teach to 11-year-old kids.  And that was quite condescending.  The truth is, we don't learn that until we're 12.
