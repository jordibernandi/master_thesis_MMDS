            "text": "what can you share with us about the energy of Michael vortex 2019?  how humanity can utilize it for special spiritual development.  commune with angels to it's your belief system.  allow it to get stronger and The more you feel that energy is working through you, use it for healing for the most part.  Use it for yourself.  You don't have to save the world, but you can disconnect to the Michael Vortex and just let it flow through you and you can let it flow to others.  Allow that vibration to allow your wings, you know, your own angel wings to open.  Because everybody, everybody has an angelic energy.  It's just how much do you use it?  Everybody's an angel.  Now, do you utilize those angelic energies is up to you.  Now some might look at it differently, call it something else, but everybody has an angelic form.  Um, so we'll realize, well, you can use that energy to, to develop your wings.  If you wish to utilize your wings at all, feel the wing energies around you, the angel wings basically.  And another way people do, uh, is like visualizing angel wings on everyone, on people.  If you want to send energies out to others, you can visualize angelic energies.  You know, everyone's at a different level of angelic understanding.  Not everyone's going to, you know, go into that aspect of themselves.  Over here is humans now, but you can be very much an angelic human.  So realize your angelic self and let that power up.  Remember, it's all in your belief systems.  So now you say, okay, I am a powerful being.  I am an angelic, powerful angel.  Now, some people remember their angelic lifetimes because they were an angel before they incarnated into this world.  A lot of them are new souls, too.  but it does not mean you don't have that energy and others don't.  It's just, you know, they, it went to human incarnations.  They just forgot a great deal, you know, because you're here to be human, you know, but you still, you're a human, you know, you're an angelic.  I mean, everyone's an angelic energy, but some take on the role as angel.  So it's like technically everybody's an angel to a certain point of view.  It depends on what you want to utilize.  Thanks for watching! ",
