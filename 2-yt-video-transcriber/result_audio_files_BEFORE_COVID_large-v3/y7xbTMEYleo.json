            "text": "Hello, everyone.  In today's video, I'd like to add my two cents to the mainstream media manufactured controversy surrounding Joker.  Now, unless you live under a rock, you probably won't have missed the absolute onslaught of hysterical articles in the wake of this film's release.  The mainstream media proclaimed that it was an incel film, a film for toxic white men and expressed fears of a mass shooting occurring at one of the film's screenings.  Over and over they repeated variations of this narrative until observers in general got the impression that it almost seemed like the mainstream media wanted a mass shooting to happen.  Then their warnings would be vindicated.  The, we told you so, all white men are evil.  floodgates would once again be opened.  As there have already been so many Joker film reviews, as well as tons of commentary surrounding the media hysteria, I don't intend to delve too much into these topics.  Instead, I'd like to focus on a very important question that's been utterly disregarded by the media, perhaps deliberately, or perhaps because they lack the compassion to even consider it.  Why is it that so many young men are finding the Joker film and the Joker character in general so relatable.  Is it because all men are evil and secretly want to commit mass shootings?  No, but this seems to be the narrative that the media wants you to believe.  While of course there are a few crazies, a few evil men out there who do relate to wanting to commit such heinous acts, the vast majority of men don't relate to the Joker's transformation into a killer, but rather to his hopelessness beforehand, to his depression and despair, to the lack of love and even basic compassion shown to him by others, to the cold reality of being cast out by society, and perhaps even to hiding one's suffering with humor and a smile.  I think it's quite interesting that the Joker is presented in the film as having a neurological condition that causes him to uncontrollably laugh and that often when he's laughing, it appears as if he's in pain.  In some ways, I think this is reflective of many young men today.  It can be seen in their internet meme culture.  Men, some women, but mostly men by far, have taken to using the clown world meme as a way to express their disapproval and frustrations with society.  Honk honk they write as, day after day, accusatory stories flood their feeds, stories filled with unprovoked attacks on men, but particularly white men, that paint them as the cause of all the world's ills.  Obviously the phrase honk honk isn't the extent of their feelings, and there are much more complex reactions going on beneath the surface.  They're not truly finding humor in the current course that our society is taking, They're simply using humor as a means to cope.  If you Google the act of using humor to hide pain and depression, you'll find a whole host of very interesting results.  How men use humor to hide the relentless pain of sadness despair and mental illness, masking depression with humor.  There's pain and laughter.  Why the saddest people are often the funniest.  Comedy and depression, the hidden symptom.  Since the mainstream media is failing to ask the question why so many young men are relating to the Joker character, They're naturally also failing to ask the question how we as a society can help.  It's bad enough to ignore the struggles of men, but the mainstream media and most of the powerful institutions in general, big tech, Hollywood, the education system, and so on, have taken the buckling down.  to incessantly berating and poking them when many of them already feel demonized and isolated enough as it is.  I guess I missed the part where it became some sort of journalistic requirement to be a complete psychopath.  Perhaps these people are able to act this way due to the online disconnect and they're much more civil in real life but the way that they act online is reflective of an unbelievable heartlessness and cruelty.  At what point did our society decide to abandon even the most basic sense of compassion for our own, for our homeless, for our mentally ill, for our drug addicts, for our depressed and suicidal, for those suffering abandonment by one or even both of their parents, for those who feel judged and demonized for something inherent and completely outside their control, such as for being men.  I really think that C.S.  Lewis said it best when he stated, we make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise.  It's ironic to me how society today laments and criticizes the quote-unquote degradation of young men, while at the same time failing to take any sort of responsibility whatsoever for its role in their ever-increasing demise.  As I already stated previously, of course there are some evil men out there, but there are also some evil women.  Evilness is not some sort of inherent male quality.  Common decency in regards to men really shouldn't be too much of an ask.  But the mere fact that for many nowadays it is, should create far more concern in ourselves than any of the artificially contrived problems such as the Joker film having toxic fans that the mainstream media would have us believe deserves our undivided attention.
