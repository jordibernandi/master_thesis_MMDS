Yes, we do sell awesome stickers, t-shirts, and other cool products at non-compete.com slash shop.  The fine folks at Non-Compete don't directly employ anyone, so they aren't directly robbing anyone of labor value, which means they aren't engaging in capitalism directly.  And they do do the best that they can to limit capitalist exploitation, like the stickers they make are printed by a small shop owned and operated by a single family, and they worked hard to find a t-shirt factory that has relatively decent working conditions, but even though the employees of that t-shirt factory are unionized and it's not a sweatshop, it's still a capitalist institution.  So when you buy a high quality, 100% cotton non-compete t-shirt for as little as $12, you aren't directly supporting capitalist exploitation, but some of the money will go to a for-profit corporation.  Sure, you'll be supporting leftist content creators and getting cool stuff at the same time, but there's no way you can buy anything in a capitalist society without participating in capitalist exploitation.

Liberal identity politics are rooted in preserving and stabilizing the status quo.  Liberals sometimes use the phrase, getting a seat at the table, to describe their identity politics.  The table in this metaphor represents the unjust power structures of capitalist democracy.  In theory, liberals believe that having more people from minority groups represented in the higher levels of these power structures will improve the situations of vulnerable people at the bottom.  In practice, vulnerable groups become divided as they are forced to compete for resources and attention.  What they're really talking about isn't some kind of Arthurian roundtable where everyone who gets a seat is an equal.  What they're really talking about is a hierarchy.  where the people on the higher levels hold exploitative power over the people below.  Moving up a few representative members of a vulnerable group doesn't really help the people below.  If anything, it often leads to formerly vulnerable individuals becoming oppressors themselves, and they are still vulnerable to the more powerful groups that are even higher up the hierarchical ladder.  Representation does nothing to correct the real damage that is being done by these extremely harmful and destructive systems.  A few gay, black, and immigrant senators and CEOs might have some benefit for some people from these groups, but the system itself is still inherently exploitative.  Even worse, competition between vulnerable groups invariably arises as they vie against each other for attention and resources from those in power.  Who deserves more attention?  This group, or that group, or that one over there.  These vulnerable groups are left divided as they each rally to push their individual agendas forward with the hopes of receiving much needed relief from suffering.  This leads to an eternal cycle of gains and losses for vulnerable groups as they are reduced to duking it out with each other to obtain desperately needed resources and relief which are being withheld from them by the dominant class.  Leftists, on the other hand, seek to smash the fucking table.  We recognize that capitalism plays vulnerable groups against each other, and rather than asking nicely for representation, we demand that unjust power structures be completely dismantled.  We hope to build a united front of all vulnerable and exploited people working together to tear down capitalist imperialism and other forms of oppression, and we hope to build a new system based on true equality, open democracy, and the abolition of unjust hierarchies altogether.  Leftist intersectionality is all about understanding how different forms of oppression interlock and reinforce each other, and coming together as an organized collective to construct a new system where one class of people never holds unwarranted power over others.

The fact is that American capitalism has set a new standard for human welfare.  And if we keep its basic principles strong and vigorous in the years ahead, The opportunity of every American for a still better living standard will certainly be enhanced.  And perhaps even the disciples of socialism and communism will come out of their shadowy pipe dreams and join us in our march of human progress.
