The reading series for this week is something that, it's one of these things I found on Twitter a while ago and I've been waiting for like, sort of like the Ross Douthat sailboat story or the Rod Dreher canon.  I've been waiting to introduce this character and like this particular storyline into the reading series.  And I think today is the right time to do it.  And that storyline is the saga of Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby and his teenage son.  Now, this one is very obscure because Jeff Jacoby is like a D-list David Brooks.  Like I said, he's been writing for the Boston Globe.  And he's like sort of your bog standard, like sort of square ass, like nerd conservative.  He's like David Brooks, except he writes for the Boston Globe.  And I'm just going to give you... I just went to the Boston Globe and just clicked on Jeff Jacoby, and I just want to give you the taste of what his most recent articles were.  Just the headlines here.  A sad spectacle in St.  Louis.  If character matters, electing Clinton or Trump would be a moral disaster.  Why Boston can learn from Houston's non-existent zoning code.  campaign.  so they just you know this is just boring conservative dad pundit stuff. ",
