            "text": "Young men today are lost.  They've been spoon-fed the big bullshit.  A lie that you need to go to school.  Get good grades.  You need to get a good job.  You need to get married.  You need to acquire debt.  Buy an expensive house.  Buy an expensive car.  Get into debt to pay for your school.  You need to get a job so you can pay off the debt that you used to go to school.  And so on and so forth.  They've been sold a lie that they'll get a job by going to school.  That's all a lie.  If you want success, if you want more in life, if you want abundance and make fuck you money, you have to take it and it has to be on your own terms.  You must take it by the balls.  School, college, doesn't mean jack shit.  It really doesn't.  Anything you want to do doesn't require school, unless you want to be a doctor, a dentist or a lawyer.  If you want to live on your own terms, do what you want to do.  School is not required.  Are you going to be a sheep or a badass fucking wolf?  The choice is yours.
