            "text": "I get up this morning and I check my phone.  And of course, down there in the Dallas, Houston area, you know, we got a few police officers that are actually in the ministry.  And of course, this particular officer sends me this video this morning.  Says, Pastor, I want you to look at this.  Mind you, an officer.  So I clicked on the video and what did I see?  Well, I saw a black woman and a white man.  4 a.m.  in the morning, apparently having some type of altercation out there in the parking lot.  Don't know all the details.  I can only give you what I saw.  Apparently, the woman was driving the wrong way or something or blocking.  It escalated.  The white man approaches her with his gun brandished, I mean, in his hand at his side.  Apparently, the black woman starts recording him.  He knocks.  her phone out of her hands.  She turns and she hits him.  Mind you, the guy has a gun on him.  He proceeds to beat her and hit her like a man.  And he gives her four or five good haymakers.  My opinion about this first of all what kind of man is it that can hit a woman and not drop her?  i promise you i hit a woman.  i don't give a damn who she is.  she is gonna drop.  she gonna drop like a two-ton heavy stick number two and i'll continue to roll through this.  Women, be you black or white, what are you doing out at 4 a.m.  in the morning?  A little bit more information to remind you that this man is a bartender.  So everything's already sitting up wrong anyway.  Let me give a little bit of wisdom and advice here.  Unless you are armed, And I'm gonna use this as an example.  Our sisters are trained pretty damn good.  And women, if someone pulls out a weapon on you and they hold it down at their side, you see, this is the problem right here.  You're not properly trained how to respond.  You don't know how to react.  In a situation like that, You don't escalate the situation by trading words with someone that is armed, especially given the demographics.  That's the time for humility.  A win in that situation is learning how to keep your mouth shut, deescalating your spirit, and don't let your ass or your mouth override your ass.  Real talk here.  Now, mind you, I'm not like these other bootlicking pastors out here.  I'm a real talker, all right?  That's not the time to be trading words with someone.  That's not the time, especially you ain't armed and all you got is a cell phone and a camera.  Listen, a camera will do nothing to help you in a situation when someone has a gun.  Who cares if it is on videotape?  That day, like Sandra Bland, you could have died, went off into eternity.  It's only in her interview that she admitted to saying, okay, okay, okay.  After this man knocks the hell out of her two or three times, that humbled her.  That caused her to shut her mouth then.  You know, that was one of them, oh shit moments.  Oh, damn, oh, maybe I do need to shut my mouth.  Because a man is not gonna sit up there and take a bunch of damn lip from a woman.  Let me give y'all some education here.  Listen, you may run your mouth.  You may later on win a case in a court or whatever it is.  But listen, you are not in a win situation when your mouth is done ran too much and he closed it by giving you a five finger discount, close fits.  Do I agree with that man actually having to sit up there and hit a woman?  No, no, no.  I don't agree in this situation right here.  Neither do I agree with a woman putting herself in a position or a place to actually hit a man.  You see, from what I saw in that, number one, he was wrong in having a gun on that woman for no reason at all.  He should actually go do some jail time.  And she's fortunate to get out of this situation alive.  Number two, women, don't you put yourself in a damn position thinking that you can sit down and hit a man and a man ain't gonna retaliate on you.  I don't know where that, look, the police wasn't nowhere around to help you.  I'm trying to get that through y'all thick head.  Laws are not gonna be around to help you when someone wants to beat you.  Man.  It was caught on video camera, which if it wasn't caught on video camera, we can only imagine how this story went because we see that not only police officers lie to save their hide, but people lie to save their hide.  And if it wasn't for this guy, video camera and taping this on the side, it would have been her word against his word in Dallas.  Think about that for a second.  It'd have been a black woman's word against a white man's word in Dallas, Texas.  Think about that for a second.  Real talk.  Pastor Don ain't colorblind.  I'm just telling it like it is.  I understand the reason why the cameraman didn't go over there.  Because you don't go running up on nobody who actually has already brandished a gun.  That's the time when cooler heads need to prevail.  That's the time when you think about saving your hide.  Because if you don't have a firearm, you finished.  Now, I mean, what do you do in the instance like that?  Let's just say hypothetical situation that you are an armed man and you see this guy have a gun drawn on a woman or a gun out on this woman.  What is the proper response?  What is the proper response?  Now, that's a good question, isn't it?  If you don't know the proper response, you had better learn it because things are going from bad to worse in this country right here.  Woman, you have no right to lay your hands on any man because a real man, You may do that with other men who are emasculated men.  But you ain't gonna do that to no real man.  He gonna put you in your place.  And that's exactly what that man did.  Now, mind you, he lost his job.  And again, let me say it again.  I don't believe in going around busting up on women.  I don't.  But I also believe that if she means to do you harm, bust her up.  I'm telling you.  In other words, don't set up and take no butt whooping by no woman just because she's a woman.  No man ain't going to do that.  I don't care what laws say.  But anyway, it's a bad situation all the way around.  There's much lessons to be learned here.  It really truly is.  And one lesson is don't wham it, wham it.  First of all, mama.  I mean, think about this.  Young women, you're not going to be young all the days of your life.  You just simply are not going to be young.  There's gonna come a time in your life, it should happen early.  You should try to look to be humble and settle down and develop a family in your young age so that you don't have to be out there on the streets, 3  a.m.,  4 a.m.  in the morning during the weekday.  What is that?  You ain't supposed to be there.  Nothing good happens at 2  a.m.,  3  a.m.,  4 a.m.  in the morning.  Nothing.  You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Keep your tail at home.  Now, I can hear the feminists now.  Okay, feminists, go ahead and have your fun.  How you like that, them five knuckles upside your face then?  What if it wasn't on camera now, then what?  Because, I mean, how's she going to ID the guy unless she was there at the bar or something like that?  Wrong time, wrong place.  Man, I tell you, man, the way that this world going, bad to worse, bad to worse, bad to worse.  Anyway, it's bad.  Women don't be out no two, three, four o'clock in the morning.  Well, that's my job.  Get another job.  And definitely learn, don't let these, this news source, don't let these people out here in this world toy around with your mind.  Feminism ain't gonna work against a man.  Again, it's a bad situation all the way around.  Many lessons to be learned.  It really truly is.  But I tell you one thing, it's bad when a man can set up and just wail on a woman like that.  I mean, she can't even retaliate because she knows he got a gun anyway.  That's when you as a woman, you should be properly trained.  You should know how to respond and react in a situation like that in order to protect yourselves.  I promise you, our sister's doing the ministry.  That I promise you. ",
