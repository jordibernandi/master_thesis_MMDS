            "text": "The feminists are at it again.  The radical feminists, to be exact.  The trans exclusionary radical feminists.  What I'm trying to say is, the TERFs are having a normal one.  I feel like this hair is going to increase the amount of people that come to my channel and leave a comment without watching the video.  I like to title my videos the thing that I'm arguing against.  So I always get people that jump into my comment section like, shut up feminazi.  And then I see them edit that comment in real time to say something like, cool vid bro.  So I feel like I'm just gonna get a lot of shut up SJW.  So that's good.  That's a thing that I get to look forward to in my life.  That's one thing.  So I woke up this morning, unfortunately, and was reminded that my own audience hates me.  Because a good audience, an audience that loved the creator, wouldn't constantly bombard them with this shit.  I don't know why you guys hate me so much.  So today's cursed content is from the subpage, the subreddit, what is it called?  I don't know, I was, I think I've been on Reddit once to do AMA.  But yeah, this comes from the subreddit rgendercritical.  Gender critical is the term TERFs like to use because as we know TERF is apparently a slur.  They call themselves gender critical in the same way like racists call themselves race realists or pedophiles call themselves minor attracted people.  or I call myself talented and successful.  There's no reason to lie.  Why are we lying?  I don't want a baby boy.  I feel like a monster for saying this, but hoping this might be a place where some people can understand.  Lately I've been feeling like I really want another child, but I'm holding back because I don't know what I'd do if I had a boy.  I have a daughter who's brilliant and fierce and the best thing in my world.  We try hard to keep her free from all the gendered BS of childhood and let her just be herself.  but I've learned it all seeps in from friends, from school, from TV, et cetera.  I don't know how to raise a boy when I genuinely hate modern men and masculinity.  My husband is an exception because he's done such a lot of work on himself.  That poor guy.  Can we get an F?  in the chat for that man's balls, please.  Do I have too much anger and trauma with the patriarchy to raise and love a healthy boy?  The patriarchy.  Haven't heard that name in years.  You can abort it if it's a boy and then try again.  I would.  Jesus Christ that's fucked up.  Both pregnancy and abortion are great risks to women and shouldn't be taken lightly.  Wanting to abort a child because he's male is super fucked up.  You love to see it.  You love to see someone with a brain.  That is how low the bar is.  She is allowed to refuse to create yet another oppressor.  I understand that you are extremely male identified and you center them over all.  Radical. ",
