            "text": "If you asked me what is the most important doctrinal precept that is either twisted or ignored or denied today, I would say it is the sufficiency of Scripture.  The authority and sufficiency of Scripture was one of the two pillars of Reformation theology.  It was the formal principle of the Protestant Reformation, the material principle being sola fide, justification by faith.  In recent years, and I've been thrilled with this, the resurgence of Reformed theology has shined the spotlight on sola fide and lots of our theological allies have defended the principle of justification by faith.  And I think that's filtered down even into the lay level, which is a good thing.  It's an important doctrine.  But equally important is the sufficiency of Scripture and the reformed resurgence recently has ignored that doctrine and in fact even denied it because we want to embrace continuationists and others who don't really believe in the sufficiency of Scripture as it's been historically defined.  You've got books that were written for people at the lay level like Experiencing God telling people that if you're not hearing fresh messages from God you're not really experiencing Him the way you should and so We've got hordes of lay people who read these books and think they need to be listening for the voice of God and what they're actually hearing is their own imagination and putting that on par with divine revelation it's a dangerous place for the church to be in and if there's one doctrine that needs to be resurrected and re-emphasized today it is the sufficiency of Scripture.  The average lay person doesn't understand the doctrine much less really understand why it's so important And so we want to emphasize that in this conference and remind people not only of the doctrine but why it is so vitally important.
