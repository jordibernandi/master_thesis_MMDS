            "text": "Welcome to another dumb things people say to atheists.  So this week we're dealing with one that can really get under my skin.  Maybe even more than direct insults like, you're only an atheist because you want to sin.  This is probably because it makes the huge arrogant assumption that a Christian can know, one, how my lack of belief in God impacts my personal outlook on life, and two, that their faith is the only thing that could ever give a person hope.  And that, of course, is, atheists have no ultimate hope, because approaching me with the immediate pretense that my lack of belief in your specific thing leaves me empty and despondent is a great way to start a conversation.  But wait, before we start that, there's another aspect of this that's way worse.  And that's when someone decides my atheism might bleed over to other people, for example my children, and they tell me that I'm taking away those other people's hope too.  which escalates this from a mere patronizing personal insult to an accusation that my atheism makes me an unfit parent and general detriment to society, since, of course, I'm obviously interfering with people's ability to cope, sending them spiraling into ultimate despair, and ultimately contributing to destructive life choices that result from this dim outlook.  So thanks for your concern about that.  But before we get into why this is such a dumb thing people say to atheists, let's cover the part about why this statement, or at least the root sentiment behind it, is at least somewhat understandable.  Because like a lot of the most annoying things we hear, the phrase, atheists have no hope, is just a perversion of a deep-seated feeling that's pretty universal to most of humanity.  That's why a lot of these statements, dumb as they are, get at least some traction with a lot of pretty reasonable people.  I think we all feel a certain yearning for some ultimate sense of security, for the feeling that no matter what might happen, we are all going to be okay in the end.  But the sad truth is we simply can't be assured of this.  Like it or not, all it would take is a slight shift in fortune, be it the loss of a job, home, or relationship, to change any of our lives in potentially devastating ways.  And even if we're super lucky and that never happens, we're still faced with the inevitability that all we hold dear will fade or change over time in an endless act of erosion that we'll never be able to control and that will ultimately end in all our deaths.  And while we typically maintain sanity by retreating into the comfort of day-to-day life and the illusion of stability that it gives us, all it takes is a few minutes of contemplation to remind us of how terrifyingly fleeting it all is.  So that was fun to talk about, right?  But as depressing as it sounds, that is the reality of the situation, for all of us.  And I don't think we're even going to begin understanding why Christians turn to God for hope, or think a lack of belief in God takes away hope, without remembering how hard this can be to confront.  The fact is, Christians didn't invent this idea out of the blue just to poke at us.  Many of our earliest works of literature show people striving for some way to circumvent their mortality or gain mastery over a faith that can upend their lives at any time, only to have to come to terms with the fact that they simply can't.  And the fact that they can't, that none of us can, apparently, has led many people to fall back to the belief that there must be some form of safety net that will catch them when things go wrong.  And this can range from the overtly codified Christian hope that God will provide earthly help and a heavenly home, to the barely religious warm and fuzzy sense that there's something bigger out there looking out for us.  I've had conversations with people who fall on many different places along this spectrum.  Some, including Christians, cited their belief as a source of hope that they find important, but were still able to respectfully acknowledge where I was coming from when I said that specific hope wasn't important for me.  And I generally wouldn't push things too hard with these types.  I think short, gentle articulations of how you can find hope without God, worked naturally into conversation as it comes up, might slowly add to their perception over time.  And while I hope they can grow in their understanding of where people find hope and, if necessary, develop better coping skills or at least a more explicit understanding of coping skills they're already using, trying to force this point too hard will be counterproductive and possibly strain relationships with people who didn't start out that combative with you.  So if they're willing to live and let live on this point, I wouldn't stir things up with them too dramatically.  However, those who take the hard stand that everybody needs this kind of hope and codify the idea into a criticism of atheism on the grounds that it takes away people's hope are a different story entirely, especially when they actively enter your world insisting that this lack of hope makes atheism so dangerous that you're better off giving it up, as if you can just give up not believing a specific claim and damn well better not drag anybody else into it.  This is where this line really becomes a problem, and I most typically hear this blurted out in exasperated desperation as a kind of backdoor appeal to consequence after other apologetics fail to gain traction.  But even setting aside that this is an ultimately empty thing to say to an atheist, since, you know, it bypasses the question of whether God even exists and thus whether or not hope in him is a false hope, this statement is open to some really basic questions.  In short, what is ultimate hope to begin with?  And is it realistic and a good idea to expect and rely on it?  To present these questions in a way that's very tangible to Christians, you could ask them to imagine a universe in which everybody just automatically goes to heaven no matter what.  Now this is objectively more hopeful than the Christian idea of how things work, right?  I mean, you as a Christian might feel you have ultimate hope in the form of your own salvation, but the end is horrifyingly not hopeful for non-Christians.  So if you're not a total piece of shit, you probably hope for the salvation of others, especially your close loved ones.  And if you're like I was as a believer, you must feel some distress over the fact that you're not in control of whether they accept Jesus.  So really, as much as the religion tries to look past this with the vague thought that God will wipe away your tears in heaven or something, this worldview doesn't offer you the ultimate hope.  So are Christians better off living as if everybody automatically goes to heaven?  After all, this will make them feel better and experience a greater level of hope, right?  Well, sure.  But of course the Christian would naturally object that even if it temporarily made them feel better, they would be feeling better out of ignorance.  And the moment they died, they'd realize their hope had been a false one and that they would have been better off taking necessary steps to prepare for the moment of their death.  This line of questioning should make a couple things clear.  One, even given imperfect circumstances, you can find the best or most hopeful outcome for a situation.  And two, simply hoping in something that isn't evidently true can lead to you not taking important action, thus actually making things worse.  Thus it would be foolish and dangerous to automatically hope everybody goes to heaven if that's not necessarily the case.  But then isn't it equally foolish and dangerous to automatically hope God will make everything okay if that's not necessarily the case?  To break this down, I want to look at three main ways.  I've heard Christians express the hope God gives them.  First, that you have the ultimate hope of heaven after you die, of course.  Second, that God generally works things out for the good of those who love him and trust in him, so your earthly troubles will always be under control.  And third, that when other people fail you, God will not.  The first one is problematic because if God doesn't exist, people are wasting their precious time on earth pursuing the hope of an afterlife that might not, and in atheist estimation almost certainly does not, exist.  So their time could be far better spent making the best of the one life they have.  Not in the empty pursuit of pleasure at all costs that Christians seem to think is the only alternative to religion, but in living a life that is balanced and fulfilling, and that contributes to the good of others while leaving a legacy to those who come after you.  Now I know Christians can brush this argument aside on the Pascal's wagery grounds that living out a Christian life can still be fulfilling, and of course even if you don't gain anything after you die, you also don't lose anything.  The not losing anything part is true but pointless on grounds that lead us down a whole other rabbit trail, and the fulfilling life part is at best up for question, as all Christians can appeal to is a personal preference-driven assessment of what makes a good life.  They really can't demonstrate that their lives are qualitatively better than ours, and while we atheists don't have hope for things to be eternally great, we can hope for the best within the bounds of reality as we understand it.  Does this give us what we might call an ultimate hope for the best possible outcome ever?  No.  But can we find significant hope in the fact that things will often be good if not ideal?  Yes.  And a positive outlook, along with personal planning and adapting strategies, will help us better things for ourselves and others as far as we can.  Now sure, it does require some basic coping skills to accept that not everything will be perfect in the end and to confront our mortality and the temporary nature of our existence.  But we can still find hope in this, and a mature sense of hope based on the reality of the situation is far better than a false hope based on things that are probably fake.  At the very least, the assumption that we have no hope is unfounded, and the idea that everything has to be perfect forever or we should all wallow in despair is frankly childish.  Now the second two points are close to the same, with the third kind of being a subset of the second.  Basically, these are assurances that, along with providing salvation, God will make sure that you'll always be more or less okay on earth.  And while things may temporarily go wrong, he'll always be there to catch you so that, as 1 Corinthians 10.13 is popularly misconstrued as saying, he will never give you more than you can handle.  I want to focus on the language of the third point, though, because of the clear example it gives of something going wrong and the contrast it provides between God and humans.  One criticism I often hear is that people are imperfect.  So if I take away someone's hope in God, which is an interesting way to describe encouraging people to think about religious claims, I'm leaving them without anything to fall back to when people inevitably fail them.  So okay, yeah, fine.  People might fail them at some point.  But there are a few things that need to be clarified about the simplified statement that people will fail you.  First off, people fail you by degrees.  It's not a dichotomy between utter reliability and utter failure.  And frankly, if you need the anticipation that anybody will always fulfill all your needs and your relationship won't survive them not doing so, that's an internal issue you need to work out.  Second, there are other people in the world, and hopefully if you tend to a healthy and diverse number of relationships and manage your expectations of them, you're not going to find yourself utterly alone.  And third, you can and should develop a level of self-reliance sufficient to help you anticipate, cope with, and get past whatever these failures are.  Really, most healthy adults should already understand the three things I just said, at least intuitively, and they should be prepared not only to absorb basic relational friction without considering it the other person's failure, but to keep functioning when things do go wrong in one specific relationship.  In short, there are diverse adaptive strategies we should all have for managing our expectations not only of people but of our circumstances and for going on despite what life throws our way.  Do we have the hope that any specific tangible thing will always catch us before we fall a certain distance?  No.  Are there any guarantees in life?  No.  But a mature person who understands and is more or less ready for the world should be able to adapt in the absence of these guarantees.  And Christians do the same thing in their own way.  Because if God exists, it sucks that some people will go to hell.  But as a Christian, you adapt to the fact and prepare yourself and others to go to heaven, all the while maintaining a level of hope.  If God does not exist, yes, it sucks that life changes, things go wrong, people fail us and someday we will all not exist.  But we adapt to these facts and take practical steps to meet these challenges while, yes, maintaining a healthy level of hope.  I can stay hopeful without expecting to avoid tragedy or live forever.  It's just part of being a psychologically healthy adult.  One final note.  If life does go wrong and, humor me Christians, God doesn't exist, then pretending he does can be a dangerous thing.  It can steer you away from healthy adaptive strategies and proper expectations of your circumstances.  The fact is, God will not step in and take the place of humans in a clear, tangible way.  You've never seen that happen, and deep down I think you know you never will.  At best you're going to get vague yes, no, or later answers from him, and life will continue along its natural looking course, as it always has.  While you keep telling yourself there are reasons he lets trials continue and, no matter what those trials are, he will never give you more than you can handle.  But if God doesn't exist, then doing this is at best pointless and at worst blinds you to how to most intelligently navigate life's obstacles.  And if you're training someone else to hold this hope, then what happens when they can't keep seeing God in random data as well as you do?  What happens when they slip into a gradual realization that their hope in God was empty?  If they ever reach the point that they perceive this failure, and the fact that God's not there suddenly clicks in their mind, then he will not be the only one to have failed them.  You, as the person who told them to put all their chips in one place, to avoid preparing themselves for the world because some magical invisible person will catch them, you will have failed them too.  You will have trained them to wander blindly into life's problems, unready for its eventualities.  because realistic hope is not the same as no hope, and it's certainly better than false hope.
