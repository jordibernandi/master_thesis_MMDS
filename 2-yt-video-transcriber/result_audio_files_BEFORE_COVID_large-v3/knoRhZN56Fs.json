            "text": "to me if he stayed out.  racist.  Yo, this is Tyesha.  Real quick before I hop in the shower and take all this off, I wanted to try to edit the videos that I did for Sunday Gun Day at the range.  And this was my first time taking my rifle out, you know, the rifle I got for my birthday, and I named it Huey P. So today, February 17th, is Huey P. Newton's birthday.  So, you know, what better way to honor him and what he stood for, along with the other members of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, for the first time, and I've been waiting because I ordered an optics, some optics for it, but instead of waiting, I just went ahead and took it out because I've been wanting a rifle.  I finally got one.  I never shot one before.  I never knew how to, so it just started coming together for me last year with the help of some Marines, some Army guys that helped us this out to get our own point.  So you know I went ahead and I bought that Sig M400 for my birthday.  and yeah this is my first time taking it out and oh my gosh I am in love.  So all I did was put 50 rounds down range.  I didn't have a lot of freedom to do what I want to do.  as far as like what I've seen in YouTube videos with some of the guys told me about because at the indoor race you have very strict rules.  so i did apply for a discovery pass and go out in the woods.  you know and shoot.  you know like how they do up in here in washington.  yeah that's what they do.  so next time i'll be able to have my optics on there and really get my grouping really good.  but i got all 50 rounds on paper happy about that just using the iron sights.  and i must admit when i was you know going there and you know i had this huge you know case and people were like what's in there what's in there and i'm like it's my rifle.  So I felt like, you know, that part in Full Metal Jacket, this is my rifle, this is my gun.  I don't know the rest of it, but I know the Marines know it.  So I'm going to learn it because I have a rifle and it's like super cool.  But anyhow, yes, it was really good.  I was intimidated when I was at my station.  I shot my handguns first.  And then I went ahead and went ahead and broke out the rifle.  I'm like, shit, since I'm here, you know, these rounds hot as hell because you got to buy the rounds there.  If you're going to shoot at the indoor range, you got to buy their rounds and use their ammo.  So I went ahead and got it together.  I just was going over slowly the fundamentals in my mind.  And I'm like, you know, as long as I really don't do anything stupid, like ignore the universal rules for firearms, nobody should come mess with me.  I should be good.  And, you know, I was a bit, you know, I don't want to say slow, but I was a bit, you know, kind of just hesitant and nervous at first.  But once, you know, I loaded in that first 20, which I didn't record, because, you know, once I got 20 in, I'm like, okay, keep my barrel down, rage, you know, do all this, the mechanics, bolt forward, all this other stuff is going through my mind.  And then finally, when I got those first 20 rounds down range, I'm like, wow, that felt good.  No, and this is the shoulder that I shoot with.  I'm holding this camera, not sore, felt great.  Oh my gosh, that was like the best purchase ever.  I highly, highly, highly recommend everybody get familiar with firearms before you go make that that next frivolous purchase.  you know a handgun is only about 400. you know my um my rifle was less than a thousand and you know just getting out working on mechanics.  that's why when you see me at the gym i'm mainly working on my upper body because you know i noticed i was weak with my upper body when i when i'm holding you know, rifles for a period of time.  You know, I get weak, I start dipping lower and lower.  But no, you get stronger, you keep it up because that is, not only is it protection, but it's an art and it's a confidence booster.  and you're doing something out of the norm, you know?  I don't want to be 80 years old sitting here.  Well, I should have, would have, could have did it in my heyday.  Hell no, I'm doing everything in my heyday, you know, and I encourage you to do so too.  So yeah, in honor of, you know, Dr.  Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, he would, you know, they fought for the gun laws.  They, they presented themselves as a hard target.  And that's what I want you to do.  That's why, that's why I'm more open about talking about firearms, my background in law enforcement and things like that.  Because I want you to present yourself as a hard target.  Don't, you know, be out here weak and unable to protect yourself.  You got to.  And I'm not saying you can do it to go out and pick a fight with somebody.  But no, you know, you don't know when the trouble is going to come to you.  You got to protect yourself.  So I'm talking real fast.  I'm tired.  And I don't want to keep you out here for a long time.  But check out my videos.  Like this video.  Leave some comments.  And I will see you on the next video.  Me? ",
