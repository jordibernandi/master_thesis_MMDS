            "text": "Hello.  How are you doing, sir?  How's it going?  You okay?  Freedom fighters.  It's freedom news now.  On the front lines.  Glendale Arizona at the United States Post Office for a First Amendment audit.  We have the American flag at half-staff.  I believe there was an Air Force fighter pilot who lost his life.  Here's your drop-off mail boxes.  Drive through and drop your mail off.  So I just wanted to thank some of the Southwest Auditors for all their work out on the front lines protecting our First Amendment rights.  So thanks guys.  Fully support you guys out here.  Fully support you Southwest Auditors.  so here at freedom news now we're big supporters big followers of the Southwest auditors.  there's too many to name right now I don't want to leave anyone out so I You all know who you are.  Just wanted to give you a big thank you for all your hard work out here on the front lines paving the way for the rest of us out here.  After spending some time out here in Arizona, We have realized why it's so common to record post offices out here in the Southwest.  It is definitely necessary.  we have our sign here of the sign u.s property no trespassing.  so So it appears the postal vehicles are not much different than the ones in Michigan.  Let's take a walk around the side and see what it looks like.  So you can see here there's a big wall with barbed wire fence enclosing this facility.  Security is important.  What a beautiful day here in Sunny Glendale, Arizona.  Okay, so Glendale downtown, Glendale, Arizona.  There's a full service hours and self-service hours.  There's the United States Postal Service.  .  .  .  So here's around on the north side of the building.  You can see more walls, more barbed wire fence.  Keep this facility secure.  So yeah, once again guys, I want to give a big shout out to all you Southwest auditors Arizona auditors.  like I said there's too many of you out here to name all of you that I watch and I don't want to leave anyone out but everyone knows who you are.  You're out on the front lines preserving our First Amendment rights.  It is very much appreciated.  Say U.S.  property, no trespassing.  Here's their back lot.  got a big padlock on there chain and lock.  so looks like we have a postal employee down here watching us.  he's getting on his phone.  so we've had one drive by with a cam bag.  now this guy's trying to do a cam bag.  well should we go approach him guys?  he's on the phone now he's making a call.  he's making a call in so we'll stay.  we'll hang around for a while see if we get any contact.  we don't want any contact but if we get it we'll be ready.  we'll be ready like never before.  so stay tuned guys.  this might get very interesting.  so you can see on this portion of the wall there's razor wire along the top not just barbed wire but razor wire.  So this guy down here, he's still creeping on us.  He's a creeper, following us around, making his phone call.  He has the right to do that.  That is his right.  We'll educate him.  These post offices out here in the southwest need to be audited now more than ever.  so all you Arizona auditors all you Southwest auditors get out there now get out on the front lines.  record those post offices those United States Postal Service employees.  hold them accountable.  we'll see if this guy stays around when we come up and gather more content more b-roll of the front portion of the building.  There's two people there now.  Now they're retreating.  They're leaving.  But that's okay.  We just want to be left alone and gather content for our story.  Then we'll be on our way.  no contact necessary.  Despite what all the trolls like to say, no contact is necessary.  That makes for a pass or a positive audit.  So they're gone.  They're gone, they're gone, they're gone.  That is okay.  We're fine with that.  Hello.  How you doing sir?  How's it going?  You okay?  We've got Glendale police here today.  Have a nice day, man.  Have a nice day.  Can I get your name and badge number if you're out for call for service?  Yeah, Snyder, 12251.  Thanks, Officer Snyder.  All right.  Have a good day.  Yep, have a good day.  I'm guessing you know what's going on here out in the southwest.  Thank you.  Have a good day.  Okay, so there goes that Glendale officer, Snyder, and to speak with the post office.  So they clearly, they definitely called the police on me.  They called the police on us for public photography.  The United States Post Office must have something to hide.
