            "text": "Well howdy there internet people, it's Beau again.  So we gotta talk about that Ben Shapiro thing.  Because something important happened, something that really can help illustrate something.  Now, the important thing was not Ben Shapiro just, sorry to use the term, getting destroyed by Andrew Neil, but something happened early on in that, before he took off his mic and ran away.  Okay, so while I'm starting, Americans, you probably don't know who Andrew Neal is.  You may not, anyway.  Go ahead and, while I'm talking, head over to Wikipedia and just read.  Okay, so the interview starts off with a simple question, and Ben goes on to talk about how the media in the U.S.  is very liberal.  In fact, he used the term radical left.  And he's getting that term out early.  Okay?  Because it helps divide everything.  Helps divide everything.  Now, the reality is that, for whatever reason, Fox News is the most trusted news network in the U.S.  According to the polls, that's what it is.  And then Neil goes on and kind of points out that the new ideas are coming out of the left.  in the  U.S.,  what is considered the left, using that term, coming from the Democrats.  and Shapiro I'm never going to make it through this without laughing.  Shapiro goes on this kind of rant to say that you know the conservative intelligentsia which he is apparently a part of.  they have robust debate about what should be done about the medical system and whether or not climate change is a threat.  now keep in mind he didn't actually point out any new ideas.  they have just said that they talk about it.  And then he gets posed one kind of tough question, not really, but I mean, I guess it could be if you were used to people that just play ball with you.  Neil asks him about abortion, and Ben just goes off the rails, tells him to be honest in his own biases.  I hope by now you have read a little bit about who this guy is.  He goes on to say that, you know, if you're on the left, just say that you're on the left.  Getting it out there early.  Don't believe anything this guy says.  He's part of the other team.  And then he says it's pretty evident from your questions who you are.  So he doesn't know.  He doesn't know that, I mean, this is kind of like somebody in the U.S.  calling Rush Limbaugh on the left.  Now, the whole point Neil was trying to point out was that these type of pundits are coarsening debate in American media.  This may be one of the only things Andrew Newell and I will ever agree on.  They do.  They do because they use that divide.  As soon as something gets thrown out that is in opposition, oh, well, you're part of the other team.  And this happens on the American right and the American left.  But it more so happens on the right.  And as evidence of this, scroll through my videos.  There's a dozen... on gun ownership advocating gun ownership talking about guns uh... and you won't find anything that's anti.  second amendment in any of my videos.  i have never been called right wing by anybody.  it is this is really more of a phenomenon that occurs within the right.  That's where it happens the most.  It does happen in the left.  And I'm sitting here using these terms because they used them.  And it's something I'm going to clear up here in a minute.  And then Aspen continues to just lose it.  He goes on to say, I'm popular and no one has ever heard of you.  I've heard of you.  I've heard of you, Andrew.  I know who you are.  If you're not going to go look up his Wikipedia, this is like Rupert... I mean, I think Rupert Murdoch actually hand-selected this dude for a job once.  He's not anybody's definition of anything remotely related to the left.  I mean, I know he was fairly instrumental in getting the UK involved in Iraq.  I mean, he is not a... He's not anybody's ideal leftist.  And that's another problem we have in the U.S.  Because, and it happens so subtly.  I mean, I wound up doing it in this video.  Equating liberal, left, and Democrat.  Those are not the same thing.  They're not.  We don't have a leftist party in the U.S We have some... some individual politicians that espouse a few leftist ideas.  But even those are pretty soft.  That we don't have leftists.  We don't have socialists.  Doesn't matter how many times the Republicans say it.  I have yet to hear any mainstream candidate advocate seizing the means of production.  Okay?  Or worker control of the means of production.  It's not.  We don't have that in the U.S.  Um... ",
