            "text": "On the wording on this, we're a little concerned that it's saying that the hospitals will, but it says DCFS.  It's mandating hospitals to do things, but giving DCFS options to do things.  And that puts the hospital in a little bit of a problem.  Because I don't think hospitals want to be taking the hospital over all the time.  And then DCFS may investigate.  The issue is whether you're mandated to give the vitamin K by taking productive custody.  This is what they've done.  It doesn't mean that DCFS has to say the parent can't be a parent, but it gives you the chance to give the child vitamin K through DCFS.  So I think it's okay.  You don't need every parent to be accused of medical neglect and indiscriminate.  You need the right to give the vitamin K. And the DCFS will provide you the custody for what this is consistent with.  And I think you want the wiggle room of the May on the DCFS side because what I have heard is if they're automatically slapped with medical neglect, there's all sorts of ramifications there.  So you want... So please clarify.  If DCFS says no, You can take protection custody as just the right to do what you think is right for the baby.  And do you see if they say yes, this is their rule, you give them the vitamin K and then Do any of us really care?  what happens next?  No, because you had their, you took protective custody.  That's the part of it.  That's the part that we have to assure what DCFS does.  That when we do this, to assure you.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  DCFS has to say, this is our protocol, no matter what else we do.  You are protected.  At what point does protective custody stop?  That's a different question.  It's a different question.  It's a different question.  It's a different question.  Hi, everyone.  It's Rachel Seller, the forensic nurse.  This is another example of forced vaccination.  Medical professionals, especially nurses, conspiring to basically medically kidnap your baby and inject them with a vitamin K injection that is known to be full of aluminum, heavy metals that will go into the brain and destroy human health.  This message needs to be sent around the world.  I'm Rachel Seller, the Forensic Nurse.  You can find me on YouTube.  And please help spread this message. ",
