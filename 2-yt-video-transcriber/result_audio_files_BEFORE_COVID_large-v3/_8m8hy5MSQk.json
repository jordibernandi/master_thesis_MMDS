            "text": "You know, so the other day I was cruising down on Twitter and I saw my buddy Clink.  He's a guy on YouTube, by the way.  He posted a tweet where someone who made a Vice article took a photo of him while he was at the, I think, Adult Video Expo.  I think it was.  Something along those lines.  And so I thought it would be hilarious to see what he was doing there.  So I go and I click on it and I look at some of the pictures and I notice a trend.  with the participants or with the people that attended the expo, all with the exception of Glink.  And here's the thing.  I'm going to show the pictures here first, and I kind of want to see if you guys can pick up what I'm putting down on the table of the trend or of the similarities I picked up of the attendees of the show.  So here are the pictures, right?  Now, I'm pretty sure that everyone probably noticed what I was putting down, especially considering the title of the video that you clicked on.  You'll notice, just for those who didn't, you'll notice that a lot of the men who attended on this expo are not very attractive men in any traditional or in any popular sense.  There's no, as the ins and outs would say, chads there.  And so, it got me thinking about something that I've already known, but something I never really pulled into video format.  So, no, that's what I'm doing now.  What I'm doing here today is putting my thoughts together on a video and talking about this, because I really do think that we as men are closer to each other than we normally think.  Okay, enough of that accent.  So, here's the thing.  So I noticed that these men are not the most attractive individuals.  They don't look like they're really slaying a lot of women.  I've noticed that there aren't very many strong cut muscle bound guys.  at the adult video expo or like just kinda somewhat attractive men.  now of course i'm not really like a homosexual so like attractive men doesn't really.  i don't really feel any sexual attraction obviously but more so um my ability to recognize patterns on what women seem to find standardly attractive that being tall men uh muscular men you know men with uh you know Sharper cheekbones, you know, stuff like that.  There's none of that, that classical attractive male there.  And so I was really, you know, and I made this point in a video a little while back ago.  I think I was talking about the thought audit, right?  And it's a pretty obvious point, but that point being that there are a lot more incels than we think.  Okay, now every time I talk about incels, I'm going to set the stage here and say, I think incels is a stupid fucking word, but I'm only going to use it because I understand colloquially.  People understand what I'm trying to convey, okay?  So, there are a lot more incels than we think in the world, you know?  And a lot of people say a lot of mean, harsh things about incels.  I've been getting a couple of comments on... One of my incel videos where I said incels are right.  Where I lay out some of the things that seem to be pretty obviously correct from incels.  And some people are making comments about how they just don't feel like they can support incels.  Or they just think that incels are still pretty much vile people.  But here I'm looking at these guys going to these expos.  And I'm looking at just guys like normal polite society.  And I'm looking at married men.  And I'm seeing a bunch of men just really struggle to just be able to have Sex in general, there's just not a lot of men, again, especially like it's a common, you know, joke, but not even just so much a joke, but just a common trend of sexless marriages, you know, here in America, where men just are not able to be able to have as much sex as they want.  And that would just include.  just having sex once a week, that kind of degree of just a lack of sexuality.  Now, here's the thing.  I'm specifically focusing on men, but can sexless marriages happen to women?  Can there be a man that just loses his track into his wife and just never touches her again?  Yeah, that can happen, but I am specifically focusing on the male aspect.  for now due to the fact that, again, sexless marriage is only one part of the whole involuntarily celibate thing.  And since most people think of young men when they say incels, well, that's why I'm focusing on it.  So you can certainly be a woman and not getting dicked down by your husband.  That can happen, but I'm not getting on that today.  So moving on to what I am talking about today.  It really got me thinking about the fact that there are, like, the total lack of ability for, like, average men to be able to just, like, get into relationships and have sex despite the fact, like, despite the time period that we're living in.  You know, right?  You see us getting bombarded with sex and sexuality on a regular basis.  You get a whole bunch of it.  You can get a whole bunch of it on Instagram.  And there's a lot of things girls are getting away.  Like, a lot of, like, models on Instagram are really pushing envelopes.  of what they can post up to a point where it's like genuinely just soft core pornography up to a point where it's just genuinely them being naked or just them covering up their nipples or them wearing like a thong.  and I guess that's okay with Instagram because like no holes are showing.  but I mean you know it gets pretty it cuts it pretty close is what I'm saying.  there's so much sexuality being blasted at us.  you know porn being a billion dollar industry.  and yet despite the fact that there's just so much like sex, just in your face, even subliminal messaging in commercials, even the way some women dress, just like, just normally, like a woman can normally, maybe not at this point, like it's like the middle of winter now, you know, so you don't really see it as often, though you may catch it every now and again, but certainly like in the spring and in the fall, and obviously in the summer, you'll find that even the way a lot of women dress is very provocative.  If you go out to nightclubs, you know, get in warmer weather, probably not around this time, though, you'll see women wearing short shorts so short that you can see the cuff of their butt.  You know, dresses that are so tight that next to nothing is left to the imagination to where if they sit down it literally rides up and you can see that sometimes I'm not joking.  You can see that some women, they're not even wearing underwear.  It can get to that degree of a point there.  You get blasted and bombarded with so much sexuality, and yet pornography is a huge industry.  It's a huge thing that exists.  The reason why is because we have a lot of men who are, well, better to say bachelors or sexless.  And this isn't just, you know, extends to just, like, pornography or anything like that.  This also extends to, like, the Twitch thoughts, right?  Like, the premium Snapchat thing, right?  This also extends to that kind of degree as well because, and in my point where I was talking about the thought audit, I also said this as well, you know, the thing that's really funny to me is as much as people complain about themselves and make fun of them.  and whatnot, The people who are giving money to these whores, these white knights, are also sexless individuals, or they're individuals that cannot possibly be having as much sex as they want, or it's possible that they're just sex-addicted and they just want to throw their money at, you know, women on the screen.  You know, it's entirely possible that they could be in relationships with women that have sex with them, and they just don't give a damn.  It's possible.  But for the most part, let's be real, we know that that's probably not the case.  The vast majority of guys who are looking into Belle Delphine's bullshit probably are single men, and probably, more often than not, do not have wives or girlfriends, or, you know, friends with benefits of which they could genuinely have sex with them on a regular basis.  So for that definition, they want to have sex, but they cannot, and thus are involuntarily celibate.  Again, I don't like that term, but... Okay, we're gonna use it.  And I'm seeing this shit, right?  And I'm seeing that as men, we have more in common with each other than we don't.  you know there there are.  there are some men certainly who are able to be very permissive you know and then these are the guys who probably benefit the best like pick up artistry.  these are the guys you know best from all the game blogs and all that bullshit and some of these men they just don't really need it at all.  you know honestly um and sure they exist.  I'm not saying that they don't but it seems that they are the vast minority of men that exist.  this is a point that I have made numerous times on my channel as well.  But the major point that I'm making here in today's video is that when you see just kind of the blatant reality of the situation, and that is that we're pretty sexless.  You know, a lot of men are pretty sexless.  They're not really able to go out and be with as many women or just be with a woman.  And that's kind of the more important thing as well.  you see that there's just is not a lot of man who is able to be with a woman like just one out of the millions of women that exist.  i find it very difficult to not be able to say that we have a fucking problem and it's really crazy to me.  and i'm going to end the video here because in the next video i'm going to start talking about something else that i think is is really crazy.  you know i really want to break that point down.  so next video is going to be a lot longer than this one right.  But what's really interesting to me is the fact that we have so many young men who are willing to pay for pornography, who are willing to throw money at Twitch wars, who are willing to buy premium snapchats.  We have so many men.  And we focus on the incels who are angry and who are voicing their opinions and who are just genuinely upset.  Now, some of them are vile people.  I'm not going to take that away.  Some of them, like on forums, are pretty vile.  But you've got some of them on YouTube that are just trying to figure out what's going on.  Maybe to an autistic or so degree.  Maybe they just seem to really just not understand it.  But they're trying.  You've got incels who are just simply just expressing how their life has been going for such a while on YouTube.  You can certainly find them.  It's really no challenge.  I found them just typing in incels and just looking to recommend it.  You can go down that rabbit hole, which I've been on for the last two or three weeks.  It's really interesting that those guys are highlighted as self-pitying and awful and bad, and yet they are in the same category.  There really is no difference in terms of what they want from the guy who is giving money to, well, Belle Delphine or to, I don't know, Alinity or to any one of these different whores that you find on the internet.  They're the same person.  They're the same people.  One might be self-pitying, as you put it, and sad and depressed.  One might even be misogynistic.  But it's not like this guy over here is truly any better.  when he's going around giving money to these women because he's so desperate for female attention and validation.  that he feels that literally just the basic lizard urge of just men provide, women provide sex, you know, men provide money and things, and women provide their sex and sexuality, that that's the closest thing that he has to a woman, I mean, he's not really doing any much better.  I mean, maybe it's not, they're not the same exact thing.  But one, this isn't better.  You know what I mean?  And so seeing that, and it really kind of brings me to my final point and how I want to close the video out.  It's crazy to me how there's so many men that are like desperate just kind of to be liked and just to be loved by women in general.  And yet that desperation is oftentimes used as a sword to beat them over the head with.  A sword to cleave their very masculinity and their very sense of self.  And what I mean by that is, to put it simply, it is a right insult for a man to be single.  It's a right insult for a man to not have a woman like him.  But you'll notice the opposite is very different.  In fact, if a woman decides that she doesn't want to date men anymore, despite the fact that they were men of her own choosing and relationships of her own making, people praise that woman.  In the next video, I'm going to talk about a time when I saw this on Facebook pretty recently and really compare and contrast what I find to be one of the most crazy double standards and two steps that we have in our society.  So, hopefully, I left you guys with something to think about, and that's the thing I want you to think about, is how there's a lot more incels than we think.  In fact, I would wager that, uh, we're all incels now.  So, that being said, man, I certainly hope you guys enjoyed today's video, and if you did, ma'am, go ahead and click the like button.
