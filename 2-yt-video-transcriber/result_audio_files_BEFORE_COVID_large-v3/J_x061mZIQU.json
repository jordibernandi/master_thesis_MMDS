            "text": "All esteem to the most high Elohim.  This is your brother El.  We thank the most high that through his strength, through his mercy, we are now on day 36 of this 50-day journey.  There's not much that I have to say today.  What I want brothers and sisters to do is examine themselves.  As we look at these verses over here in 2 Corinthians 13, verse 5, this is one of those verses moments where we don't want to go through a whole bunch of scriptures.  We don't want to go through a whole bunch of discussions and explanations.  This is one of those moments where your soul must look in the mirror of your own soul and examine right now where you are in your walk with the Most High.  There's something that we have to remember.  This short life that we live determines where we spend eternity.  I gotta say that again, family.  This short life that we live determines where we spend eternity.  Eternity is more than 10,000 years.  This short life According to scripture, it's a blessing for us to live 70 years, 80 years.  The Most High said that he would make man's years 120 years old because of the sin of mankind.  This short life determines where we spend eternity.  So this is one of those moments where I don't want to have a discussion because a lot of times we get used to the whole routine of hearing scriptures, saying hallelujah, feeling good that we Israel and just going through the motions.  I don't want this to become one of those things where all we're doing is going through the motions.  I really want us to take this moment, this snapshot, this moment in time right now on April 5th, 2019.  This moment right here, wherever you at to just take a moment and examine yourself.  I'm a read this scripture here in Second Corinthians, chapter 13, verse five, and then I'm just going to ask a series of questions.  And I really want you to think.  And examine yourself of where you at right now in your walk with the most time.  2nd Corinthians 13 5. here's what it says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith.  prove your own selves.  so for these few moments and even after this video gets done playing get out of your mind all the other distractions, and examine yourself and where you at right now with the most high.  The first question I wanna ask, do you love the most high with all your strength, all your mind, and all your soul?  Examine yourself and answer that question.  You don't gotta type nothing in the comment section.  You don't gotta email me and say, brother L, ba-da-da-da-da.  No, examine yourself.  Do you love the most high with all your strength, mind, soul, will and might?  Examine yourself.  Next question.  How do you know that you love the most high with all your strength, mind, soul, will and might?  How do you know?  Next question.  How much time do you spend talking to the most high every day?  How much time?  How often do you hear back from the most high through the Holy Spirit?  How often does the most high through his Holy Spirit speak back to you?  Next question.  Do you serve the most highest people?  Examine yourself.  This ain't for me.  This ain't for nobody else.  Do you, you, wherever you at, whatever your name is, do you serve the most tithes people?  Next question.  Can you discern whether you are being truthful or not?  Can you discern about yourself whether you are being truthful or not?  Do you know enough about yourself to know whether you are telling yourself the truth or whether you are lying to yourself?  Which leads to my next question.  Do you lie to yourself?  Do you lie to yourself about anything?  Do you lie to yourself about how you look?  Do you lie to yourself about how innocent you are in certain situations?  Do you lie to yourself about degrading yourself and not telling yourself that you truly are who you are?  Are you honest with yourself?  Like I said, I didn't come here today to throw around a whole bunch of precepts.  This is one of those moments to examine yourself.  Next question.  If you were to transition right now and your breath would leave your body, would you go to the kingdom or would you go to the lake of fire?  Right now, if your soul left your body, would you go to the kingdom or would you go to the lake of fire?  Examine yourself.  Next question.  Are you a good mother or a good father?  Are you a good son or a good daughter?  Examine yourself.  Next question.  Do you find yourself wanting what somebody else has?  Examine yourself.  Do you?  Do you find yourself wanting what somebody else has?  Next question.  Do you fear death more than you fear the Most High?  Examine yourself.  Next question.  Do you love the Most High for who he is?  or for what he can do for you.  Examine yourself.  Next question.  What type of thoughts go through your mind when it's just you by yourself laying in the bed at night, lights off, TV playing, music playing, laws and commands playing, having conversations with your spouse, or just having inner dialogue with yourself?  What goes through your mind in those moments of solitude?  Late at night, what goes through your mind in those real moments when you in solitude?  Which also leads to another question.  Are you the type of person that even enjoys solitude where it's just you to yourself?  Can you even stand to be in your own presence?  Do you even love yourself?  Examine yourself.  Another question.  When the last time you had a real conversation with anybody else, a real conversation, not no chit chat, not no small talk, not talking about who done got locked up, who dead, who pregnant, you know, a new song that's out.  When the last time you had a real conversation with somebody that like one of those conversation.  that just is something you will always remember.  When the last time you had a real conversation.  I'm just asking.  Next question.  Do you spend more time watching videos and listening to music than you actually spend with the most high?  Examine yourself.  If you were to stand before the most high right now, what would he say to you?  Examine yourself.  Second Corinthians chapter 13, verse five, examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith, prove your own selves.  So many more questions that I could ask to stimulate thought, but I'm going to leave it at that because I want y'all in your own personal time.  to examine your own selves.  Ask your own self certain questions.  Get to the root of your own self.  Use these moments to learn how to love your own self.  Seek the most high within your own self.  Examine yourself, because at the end of the day, family, we didn't choose to be alive, but we down here anyway.  So you might as well start asking yourself these questions and examine yourself to find out what's really going on.  Search yourself.  Don't come to me.  Don't go to your bishop.  Don't go to your elder.  Examine yourself.  Because at the end of the day, the father's going to judge you and you alone.  So you need to find out what's going on.  if you don't know what's going on already within yourself and get them answers within yourself.  Pull out them.  scriptures for yourself.  Fast for yourself.  Meditate for yourself.  Pray for yourself.  Seek the truth for yourself.  And after you do all that, examine yourself.  That's all I got to say.  Shabbat Shalom family. ",
