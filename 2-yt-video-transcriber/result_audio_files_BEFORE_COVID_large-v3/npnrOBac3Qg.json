Let's assume that you're Ben Shapiro in a video game.  Okay, you're Ben Shapiro, you're playing this game, you're running around, you're having a good time, you know, you're in this world and you're fighting these really low-level NPCs, you know, you're debating them.  But after a while, you start to get bored.  You know, it's getting a bit too easy.  You're taking on these college students.  They've got no media training.  They're surrounded by a hostile audience.  You've got a guy who works for you holding their microphone.  You're up on stage.  You've even got a high ground.  I mean, it's not much of a challenge.  So you decide you want to move up.  You want to try a boss level, let's say.  So you try taking on someone else, say a reputable BBC journalist.  That doesn't go so well.  So you go back to your lower-level NPCs for a while, you know, maybe get your confidence back.  Then you find another boss, a guy called John Lennon.  I mean, he's not alive, but he's got this song that you don't like, and you can probably take him on, right?  So this is you right now, sir.  You may self-identify as a cool kid's philosopher, but I care about something called science, and facts.  don't care about your feelings.  You are literally Ben Shapiro arguing with a song that was written by a dead guy. ",
