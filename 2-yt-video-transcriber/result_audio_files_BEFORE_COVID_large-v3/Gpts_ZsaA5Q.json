You know, whether it's somebody has to get involved, whether that's family, friends, or the police.  If you got to show up and have, you know, your court documents, that means just to do what the court ordered you to do.  Because she's being that combative person.  Then she's controlling.  But on the flip side of that, if it's your time to have custody and then she wants to break all those very rules also.  Now you can't have time with your kid that's designated for you because now she just got to come over and do a CPS mama walkthrough of what's going on in your life.  But, you know, you don't get to go over there and walk through her house and, you know, what's going on in here?  Is this childproof?  Is this safety?  Like, you know, then she's controlling.  Um, is she, is she controlling when she tried, when she manipulates the relationship between you and your child?  You know, I'm saying, I'm saying is as if it's a question, but you know, when, when you have, when you're not with the kid, is she speaking ill of you?  So now by the time the kid gets around you, they're nervous.  They're scared.  You know, they're having nervous breakdowns.  You know, you try to make sure that the mother and child stay in contact.  So, you know, make calls, FaceTime.  And like I said, sometimes they just come over.  And if she's one of those people that has those phone breakdowns, you gotta be there.  I miss you I love you I know he I know he mean I know he evil boy you gonna come home you don't have much time left.  I promise you you gonna be alive when you get back I promise and the kids start breaking down too.  you know That's because she's controlling.  And these same people wonder why they want to break from their kids as they get older.  But you made this bed.  You lay in it.  You became so clingy.  Is your baby mama controlling because she's clingy?  It's not just necessarily about the child and having control over the child.  It's about... She's clingy in general, and a child is her best option to be clingy too.  You know, a child can't just get up and say, you know what, mama, I just don't want to be around you no more.  Let me just bounce because I want to break up with you for a little bit.  Yeah, I got to go around daddy because you tripping.  You know, they can't do that.  So because you're clingy, you know, you wind up putting your life on pause because you can control the relationship between father and child.  And then here's the other part.  Because of that, then you get lonely because you ain't got a man.  And the men see you playing these games and they control it.  And he's like, I don't really want to get involved with this.  But more importantly, she's controlling because after you lay this groundwork and foundation and a man starts, you know, going out, dating, moving on with his life as far as companionship is concerned.  Now, do you use his single life against him?  You can't be around my baby because you talking to women.  What?  I don't know who you going to have to... What?  You know, if you get serious with somebody, they need to check in with me to see if they're okay.  They need to check in with you.  So they need to check in with you to see if they're okay.  I want to know who's around.  I understand you want to know who's around.  But you don't get to say yay or nay.  You don't get to say, this one could be around.  I don't like that.  when they can't be around.  I mean, they're not a danger to the kid.  What's actually the problem?  You know, so is your baby mama being controlling, right?  we often talk about the reverse side where the stereotype with some guys is if you're not having sex with your baby mama you're not going to be a parent.  and there's a reverse where you know if you're not having sex with your baby mama you can't see your kid or you know every interaction has to be.  this has to be some type of money involved.  you gonna give me some money.  You're not going to give me no money, but you can't shoot a kid.  I'm already giving you money.  That ain't the point.  I need money.  And some people don't want to talk about the ladies who have this thing where they over-exaggerate how much money they need.  Like, quick, quick story.  Years ago... My child's mother was like, she needs $300.  I was like, for what?  I got to get my oil changed and I got to get my tires rotated because I don't know if I can make it where I'm going.  I was like, that probably costs, depends on where you're going, $60 to $75.  You can get your tires rotated and your oil changed at Walmart.  You know that, right?  And then she's, well, you want to see your baby, don't you?  I need $300 for my oil change and tires.  I'm like, uh-huh.  You do know that I know how to fix cars, right?  Just because I don't do it by occupation does not mean I don't know.  Like, I actually know how much that's going to probably cost, and it ain't $300, you know.  And, you know, if you don't do it, well, I couldn't make it because I needed an oil change.  You didn't give me the $300.  How was I supposed to do it?  But, you know, it didn't stop you from going out to eat.  It didn't stop you from going to the movies.  It didn't stop you from dropping the baby off to your mama now.  It didn't stop you from, you know, ladies night out.  Girlfriend's weekend did it.  It just stopped you from Wrapping the baby off to me.  You know, and people forget about that part.  That's why I say, you know, is your baby mama controlling?  Is your baby mama one of those people who want to call the police, you know, every time you're around?  You know, the type to start an argument to create, to get an order of protection, you know, or the type to start an argument.  I'm going to call my brother.  I'm going to call my cousin.  I'm going to call my uncle.  They're going to bust you up.  And it's like.  You know at some point they're going to get tired of it.  And some of these ladies forget that you call the police too many times, they're going to get accustomed to you.  Like, oh, you're calling us again to start this trouble.  Okay.  And then they're going to start looking at you crazy.  Same thing with your brother or your uncle or your cousins or your friends.  They're going to start looking at you like, You always doing this, you know, and now it's now it's a weird relationship because not a kid is stuck between is not just tension between the two parents.  Now it's tension between the two parents and, you know, family members, friends and so on and so forth.
