            "text": "Bernie Sanders had sent out a tweet a couple weeks ago where he said, the people of Venezuela are enduring a serious humanitarian crisis.  The Maduro government must put the needs of its people first, allow humanitarian aid into the country and refrain from violence against protesters.  And there were a lot of people on the left who took issue with this, that they were disappointed in Bernie Sanders.  One of them was Roger Waters from the band Pink Floyd.  I don't know if you're familiar with them, but he said, Bernie, are you effing kidding me?  If you buy the Trump-Bolton-Abrams-Rubio line, humanitarian intervention, and collude in the destruction of Venezuela, you cannot be a credible candidate for president of the USA.  Or maybe you can, maybe you're the perfect stooge for the 1%.  So it seems like there's a lot of the sentiment on the left where the US should really completely stay out of Venezuela and even doing something about the alleged humanitarian aid would be some form of imperialism.

The sanctions are designed to crush the economy, starve and destroy the population.  in the hope that there will be an uprising.  The so-called humanitarian aid was an obvious farce.  If they want to send humanitarian aid, there are ways to do it.  You can do it through the UN, you can do it through the Red Cross, you can do it through international agencies.  But it was done in such a way as to almost guarantee that it would be blocked.  It was set up so that it would be blocked, and then you could claim that they're turning down humanitarian aid.  want to send humanitarian aid, there's many international agencies that can do it.  You don't have to do it in a way which is designed purposely to ensure that it'll be blocked because it's an attack on the sovereignty of the country.  So that's simply a farce. ",

            "text": "Again, going to the 2020 presidential election, this seems to be a concern in the left, Bernie Sanders' foreign policy.  There also was the fact that he has somewhat embraced the sort of Neil McCarthyist new Cold War rhetoric against Russia and their so-called election interference.  Why do you think it is that Bernie Sanders might be adopting some of the talking points of the military industrial complex or just neoliberal slash neoconservative talking points?  Do you think that he actually believes that or that he necessarily needs to adopt those positions to be a serious candidate for president? ",

Most of them are pretty much ignoring foreign policy issues.  Sanders has picked it up even in sensitive areas.  So I don't think that's... I mean, I don't like everything he says.  I think some things should be different.  But by and large, among the existing candidates, he's the one who's gone furthest, I think, in putting forth the kind of progressive foreign policy.  That's further to go, I think.  But the fact that he's repeating what you read 100% in the liberal media, it's not all that surprising.  He doesn't have intelligence agents out in the world trying to... I don't know who his foreign policy advisors are, but he's not getting the kind of picture that you and I might think is appropriate.
