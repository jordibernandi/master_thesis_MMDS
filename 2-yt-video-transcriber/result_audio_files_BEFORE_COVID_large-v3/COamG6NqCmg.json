But this past week, a lot of hurtful things have been said about me online.  People commenting in, saying nasty things about me, calling into question, is JP still a vegan?  So many hurtful things have been said, and I want you to know it's true.  I'm not a vegan anymore.  This footage of me was leaked online and I wanted to share the truth with you because I got caught.  So I thought the time was right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.  I want to ask for everyone's forgiveness and understanding for me at a time like this.  Having the vegan community attack me, criticize me, has brought so much attention to me and so much exposure that it's grown my following immensely.  I'm grateful for that.  But still, this has been so hard for me.  It's the hardest time of my life.  After six excruciatingly tasteless years as a vegan, I finally decided to start eating fish and eggs because I was developing health issues on a vegan diet.  I was anemic, had chronic fatigue, my thyroid wasn't functioning, my hormones were all off, I had digestive issues, candida, brain fog, and depression.  I mean, aside from all that, I was thriving on a vegan diet.  And all along, my doctor was recommending that I start eating fish and eggs.  Now, I'm an influencer, so I automatically think all doctors are idiots.  But still, after five painful years of living with these conditions, I decided to take her advice.  And it's true.  I started eating fish and eggs.  And I started hating myself.  I feel like even though I'm not a vegan anymore at heart, I still identify as a vegan.  Yes, I eat meat.  I still identify as a vegan.  I just want to be included.  I feel much better now.  I know a lot of you in this community feel betrayed by me, like you lost a leader, like you're a bunch of Christians and Jesus has said, like, hey guys, I'm going to be a Muslim now.  So I know this is hard on you.  Some of you have called me a hypocrite, accusing me of having been like a militant vegan.  Ugh, you murderous meat-eating son of a bitch!  I don't think I was ever really militant.  So from the bottom of my heart, I want you to know I'm sorry.  And I still sell my vegan diet plan because a lot of work went into creating six hours of content to basically just say, don't eat animals and eat plants.  So please check that out on my website.  And I just... I want to thank you all for paying so much more attention to me during this drama. ",
