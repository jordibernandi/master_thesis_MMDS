            "text": "Well, it seems to me that you're making a distinction between discipline and strategy like and and and and like impulsive moral responding, you know like let's say that you are in a situation where you have a boss who's intolerable and And maybe what you'd like to do, you know, the resentment has built up over five years and you'd like to go in there and yell at him and tell him everything you think.  And you think, well, that's the truth.  It's like, well, it's actually, it's not a very sophisticated truth because you're doing a shallow and impulsive analysis of the situation.  Like, it would have been the case that you've already compromised yourself in 500 ways, and I'll get back to the playing the game issue, because you do have to discipline yourself too, and you have to discipline yourself to some degree by allowing yourself to do arbitrary things that are part of the system, right?  That's a necessary part of discipline.  discriminating that from compliance with unethical activity is very difficult.  so that's a hard situation.  but let's say you're you're you're going to counsel someone who has an intolerable boss and they come in and they're right at the end of their tether because maybe that's why they come for counseling.  they say I really want to tell that son of a bitch what I think of him.  and you think well I Wait a second here.  Okay, first of all, you've already eradicated from the list of reasonable possibilities that decision by failing to say small things that you could have said all the way along.  And it's not like you can just all of a sudden blurt all of that out now and that wipes the slate clean and that constitutes truth.  It's too unsophisticated.  So let's think, okay, so what is it that you want?  Well, I don't want this job anymore.  It's like, okay, now let's actually have a strategy about this then.  You don't want this job anymore.  Can you get another job?  Well, I don't think so.  Well, so you can't just quit.  Well, no, I can't because then I don't have any money and my family depends on the job.  It's like, okay, so you can't just stop this.  That's not a viable solution.  You go out of the frying pan into the fire.  Or, you know, you substitute one set of unethical actions for another set of unethical actions that are even worse.  That's not helpful.  Alright, so let's start thinking about what exactly it is that you want.  It's like, well, maybe I want a better job.  I want to work for someone who's more reasonable.  Okay, so what's stopping you?  Well, I don't have my CV in order.  My resume isn't up to date.  Well, why is that?  Well, I haven't done it for five years and I don't like doing it.  Well, why is that?  Well, because I'm kind of embarrassed about it because it has holes in it and it shows where I'm lackadaisical and where I'm not prepared.  It's like, okay, how many things are there like that?  Well, there's a bunch of things and they're all associated with how I procrastinated in the past.  It's like, okay, what are we going to do to rectify that?  So I'll say to people, why don't you update your CV?  That's what we'll do first.  Because if you're going to look for a different job, I'm not saying you're going to look for a different job.  but if you're going to look for a different job you're not going to unless your cv is updated.

            "text": "there's you gotta play the game.  there's 10 strategic actions that you're going to have to take in order to make yourself able to move laterally or up and the truth is isn't going in and yelling at your boss and telling him everything you think about him.  the truth is trying to figure out the very, very difficult process of how you put yourself in a better position.  One of the things that's quite fun about this lecture tour is the letters that I receive or the stories that people tell me about switching jobs because they do realize that they're, and I often talk to people about consulting their resentment.  Resentment's a really useful emotion, like it's really dangerous.  It's one of the most dangerous psychological states, I believe, but it's unbelievably useful because resentment usually only means one of two things.  It either means quit whining and take it on because you're immature, or it means you're allowing yourself to be taken advantage of and you have something to say or do.  And so you want to sort out the first part and find out if you're just being immature.  And you can think that through and you can talk to people.  But if it's the second, it's like, no, you've compromised yourself in a variety of ways and you have to figure out how to get out of that.  And if you're resentful, that's evidence that you have, in fact, done that.  Okay, so now the issue would be, well, how can you set your life up so that you can be without that resentment?  And so that's when you start to develop a strategy for, you know, and there's actually an adventure in this too.  I mean, I've had a number of clients who have been in jobs that they didn't like at all.  And, you know, they were tyrannized by someone, for example, and they were also working below their hypothetical level.  And we'd put together a plan.  It's like, okay.  You're going to make three times as much money in five years.  That's the plan.  But that's not going to be simple.  So there's education.  You've got to educate yourself, maybe formally, because you've got holes.  You've got to fix up your resume.  You've got to overcome your fear of being interviewed.  You have to start sending out like 50 resumes a week on a regular basis and be prepared for a 99% rejection rate.  You're going to look for a different job.  It's probably going to take six months to a year, and almost all of that is going to be rejection.  And you've got to steel yourself for that and prepare.  And maybe this is going to be a three-year process.  It's no trivial thing, but it's almost inevitably, I can't remember a single example.  where the consequence of that very careful, detailed, strategic thinking wasn't massively substantive improvement in socioeconomic positioning and a great movement towards an improving trajectory.  And there's advantages even along the way because even before that happens, the fact that you're taking genuine steps to put yourself in a better situation immediately starts to reduce your resentment even if it isn't having positive consequences to begin with.  But you have to be realistic about it.  It's like, look, it's going to be hard to update your CV because you're embarrassed about it and you should be.  It's no wonder you're embarrassed about it.  And then, well, of course you don't want to go be interviewed because you're not very good at it and there's holes in your story and you can be made nervous easily and you're not a very good advocate for yourself.  So there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done there.  And then you have to withstand the punishment of being constantly rejected when you apply for jobs because the baseline rejection rate, you know, for the typical job applicant is like 99%.  It's like the rejection rate for everything.  Is this going to work?  No.  But if you do it 100 times, it might work once.  And that's all you need.  That's exactly it.  You only need that once.  And so the truth there isn't to yell at your boss.  The truth there is to get your life together. ",

You're like, okay, fine.  You fire me.  You get some yes man to come in.  He takes my guys out on the mission and gets them all killed.  He didn't mitigate the risk properly.  It's better for me ethically to say, Hey, look, Jordan, I don't agree with this plan.  I really wish we could do it another way.  Is there any way I could flex on it?  You say, nope, you're doing it this way.  It is better for me in many situations to say, okay, I got it. ",

            "text": "Well, that's a good indication of the complexity of the truth.  I mean, one of the rules of thumb that I think is worth abiding by, and I guess this is something that makes me somewhat conservative in some ways, is is that you should do what everyone else does unless there's a very good reason not to.  And I think that's the same idea that you're putting forward, which is that if you do fight back against everything, then you're just a rebel without a cause, right?  And you discredit yourself entirely.  And if you accept everything, well, then you're not even there.  And so there's some judicious analysis of the situation that helps you understand when the time for action is right, right?  And most of the time, what you're doing in life is you're doing what other people do, and that's going along with the game.  That's part of being socialized, but there's going to be times when the right thing to do is to break a rule and to do it very carefully.  And so, there's a scene, I think this is a New Testament scene, but it might be in some of the apocryphal writings, I don't remember.  So Christ is walking down the road on the Sabbath, and there's a ditch by the road and it's very hot and in the ditch there's a hole and in the hole there's a sheep and so the sheep is stuck in the hole and this shepherd is trying to get the sheep out of the hole and Christ walks by and he says if you don't understand what you're doing you're a transgressor of the law and you're cursed.  but if you do understand what you're doing then you're blessed.  So it's a perfect example of that, because it's like if you're, okay, now here's your situation.  You're a shepherd, and you're supposed to be taking care of that sheep, right?  But it's the Sabbath day, so you're not supposed to be working.  Now, if you have decided, you've thought this through, you think it's the Sabbath day, this is something that everybody needs because everybody needs to take a rest, and this is a rule I shouldn't break because everybody needs to take a rest or things degenerate.  And I understand that, and I have a lot of respect for it, but I think that in this situation, it's still morally appropriate for me to break that rule in this slight way and get this poor sheep out of this hole, then, well, Christ's judgment was, well, then you're exactly on the right track.  But if you're doing it carelessly and stupidly, you're breaking that rule, then you're a transgressor of the law and you're cursed.  And I think that's exactly at the essence of what you're describing.  It's like you play by the rules.  but then there's a meta rule which is now and then you break the rules and you do that very very carefully because when you break the rules you're breaking the rules.  and the rules are what keep peace.  they they're what keep peace and order and so you break them only in the service of a higher peace and order.  and so that seems to be and i think that's you see this in in well the sorts of stories that are influencing even the things that you're writing like in the harry potter series for example.  Harry's friends and compatriots are quite disciplined, Hermione in particular, because she's an absolute master of her craft.  But they still break rules when it's necessary, only when it's necessary.  And that's what makes them more than the people who are just breaking rules all the time, the villains, so to speak.  And also makes them more than the people that are just being good by being conformist.  So you need that... touch of rebelliousness, but it's got to be a flavoring and not the whole diet. ",
