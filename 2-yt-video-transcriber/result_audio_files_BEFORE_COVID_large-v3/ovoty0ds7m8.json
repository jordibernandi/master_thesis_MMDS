            "text": "Here we are with another video and in this video I want to take a trip back.  With that being said, I will break down my girl Beyonce well hidden and never told story about what really happened with Sean Paul and she after their collaboration with the song Baby Boy and why we suddenly stopped seeing them perform together.  Here we go again.  I mean, this is the truth show.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  I mean, this is the truth show.  Oh, yes.  Well, if you didn't realize and may never notice that Sean Paul and Beyonce did have a thing.  Oh yes, this is during the early stages of Jay-Z and Beyonce's relationship.  It was even spoken that Jay-Z used to be very unprotective and jealous, rumored still is, especially the older he gets.  So when it got out that Jay-Z was cheating, as he had always done, being I said he broke up, and this was during the time of her tour and one of her hit songs, Baby Boy, was out.  And you all remember who the guest star was.  Yep, Sean Paul.  And he did admit then, of course denying it now, that Bea and him were seeing each other during that time.  So when it got around that Sean and Bea were an item and they were spending all of this time together on and off stage, Not to mention the song they were doing was number one for nine weeks and then some.  So Jay-Z did what he always had done and he put a stop to their relationship.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  It got so bad that Jay-Z prevented Sean Paul from performing Baby Boy with Beyonce at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards.  Jay-Z wanted to be the only performer to share the stage with Beyonce, who was his, well, one of his girlfriends at the time.  Oh, and he made sure from that moment forward, he stayed the number one.  No one who can potentially, and again, I repeat, potentially, replace him are allowed on stage not even drake.  it was even said that their first real fight was because of sean paul and this was when and may still do i mean who knows when he used to hit her.  so the repercussions of that fight shows her sudden actions later on.  she cut out a lot of sexy men off and on stage and she made sure they were at Arms lit, well, sometimes.  Beyonce is my girl.  Sometimes love playing with fire, though.  I mean, think about it, if Jay-Z was the first man she claimed to ever had sex with, I doubt it though, but let's just say he was.  I say that because it was rumored she used to date Marquise Houston, Justin Timberlake, but Jay-Z ended that rumor by doing a collab with him and she and Justin are forever denying it, but the streets talk and they hid it.  Yeah, they did.  Also, hence, his wife, Jessica, built behavior when they were all together.  Yes.  Oh, and also, most deaf and her bodyguard was told to have it.  His protection goes beyond his job.  Oh, yes.  I mean, her bodyguard protection goes beyond his job.  OK, this is personal.  So with that being said, the itch to feel someone else, especially after learning that he cheated multiple times starts to rise.  So think in that timeframe.  Here your man is screwing any hot chick walking and you're being faithful.  Hence, broken hearted girl and I wish I was a boy and many more.  I did a video about her songs relating to their relationship.  I will leave the link below or you can just click it at the end of this video.  Anyway, you all have to understand Beyonce's father was very controlling over Tina and rumored that he used to hit her.  Hence, Beyonce's song Daddy Lessons, the beginning spoken intro in the video album.  So like most men had done back then and some still do now, and you being raised seeing an abusive slash controlling father most of them usually go for men just like that.  hence her song.  she sung about her father and she said and i quote i want my husband to be just like my daddy.  so think about that and then realize that after that year and the fact that beyonce never performed with Sean Paul ever again.  Oh, I'm still not done yet because a source says that Jay-Z mouth opened wide with astonishment after Beyonce's comment asking Jay-Z to wear a Sean Paul mask for Halloween one year.  Jay-Z took Beyonce's comment to mean that Beyonce was fantasizing about Sean Paul and wanted to use him to help her play out her fantasy.  It's like It was no longer about Halloween and a Halloween costume.  He did not speak after that.  And needless to say, the dinner ended prematurely.  Yeah, this is during the dinner, said a source.  Oh, yes.  So Beyonce's Sean Paul may have done it or she may have fantasized about it.  I mean, he is fine.  And you're seeing how she was acting in that damn video.  That goes beyond acting.  I'm just saying.  And Beyonce was in her early 20s at this time.  And here you are with this hot, sexy Jamaican dude while on tour.  You horny and 20 years old.  Well, in your 20s anyway.  Oh yes, she wanted it really bad.  So did Sean Paul.  And when Jay-Z got the whiff of this, he put an end to it really quick.  They were never seen again and never crossed paths either, far as I know.  The same thing happened with R. Kelly.  And Beyonce's father also helped with that protection as well.  This was long before this current scandal with R. Kelly went viral.  He knew R. Kelly and his charm.  Hell, he was just like him.  So this insecurity coming from Mr.  Big Pimp and Mr.  Love Him and Fuck Him and Leave Him, the same man who slept with half of Hollywood before choosing to settle down with her.  I mean, it's unbelievable what men get away with.  I mean, you don't have to understand.  Beyonce owes her entire solo career success aside for, you know, her success with Destiny's Child and her Drive Challenge looks.  Just like Taylor Swift, who also writes about her relationship.  And we all know the meaning behind a lot of Beyonce songs.  She was singing about the relationships, trials, and struggles, and how his cheating affected her confidence and also triggered her insecurity.  that she desperately tried to hide, but her actions spoke louder than her lyrics, even if she didn't completely write them.  You all have to remember, in her first album, where it's in her song Signs, where she kept repeating that she was in love with the Sagittarius.  I mean, she kept repeating that over and over and over again.  She was singing about Jay-Z.  He's a Sagittarius, and this was in 2003.  When they claim to have started dating in 2002, even though there's rumors that they started dating long before then, before she was of age, they just went public in 2002.  Anyway, now they're supposed to be on great terms now.  I'm very happy for them.  They sing about their money and how they've made it.  Of course, more inside info of their trial and tribulations.  But now that they're doing great, what can you sing about, right?  Money, okay?  You have nothing else to talk about money.  Oh, and please note, this wasn't a diss toward Beyonce.
