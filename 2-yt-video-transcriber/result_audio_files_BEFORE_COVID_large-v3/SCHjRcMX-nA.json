            "text": "I see a ton of memes online that portray Robert Mueller as the bad guy.  But let's flip this story around and look at it from another angle.  Here's the rough timeline.  Trump gets elected.  The Democrats have an emotional breakdown.  The dossier shows up and the hive mind starts talking about Russia fixing the election.  Trump fires Comey.  The Demos suddenly love Comey after hating him for not exonerating Hillary.  Rod Rosenstein filling in for Jeff Sessions appoints Mueller to look into the so-called collusion.  And the Democrats spend two years in witch hunt mode.  They think they are doing the investigation.  Everybody who ever said hello to Donald Trump is a target.  They go after Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort and Roger Stone and Michael Cohen.  Nobody in Trump world is safe.  The demos will stop at night. ",
