            "text": "Greetings, my friends.  Ready for some more huge end times news.  It's just coming so fast, man.  The Lord is just laying it on.  He's just showing me so many things.  It's amazing how fast it's happening.  It's just incredible how fast it's happening.  Here's the latest.  Huge rapture and tribulation sign.  Prime Minister Netanyahu makes Bible history in Hebron.  We fly soon.  Thank the Lord.  Here's what's going down.  Expectations are high for dramatic announcement.  which was yesterday.  on Wednesday, Prime Minister Netanyahu made Israel history by becoming the first prime minister to deliver a public address in Hebron.  This event was a state ceremony at the Tomb of the Patriarchs.  Let's go ahead and go through a little biblical Hebron history, shall we?  Abraham made his home near Hebron.  It was there upon the death of his wife, Sarah, that he purchased a burial cave that today is known as the Tomb of the Patriarchs.  Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, Israel, and Leah are all buried there.  Big, big, big names in the Bible.  Abraham witnessed the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah from Hebron.  Not long after the Israelites entered the promised land from their wilderness journey, It was taken by Joshua and given to Caleb.  It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge.  Hebron was the royal residence of King David when he was king of Judah.  And it was in Hebron that he was later anointed the king over all of Israel.  The Edomites took Hebron about the same time that the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem in 587 BC.  It was not retaken by the Jews until Judas Maccabeus in... 164 BC.  Let's look at the big things in case you missed what I was talking about here.  First of all, we're talking about the place where the heroes, the ones that God made the eternal covenant, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, their wives, all buried right there.  Abraham witnessed the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah from Hebron.  Sodom and Gomorrah is the world today.  America, the majority of the world, is Sodom and Gomorrah Act 2.  And God has the head of his chosen people, his chosen man, the lead of his chosen people, Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the place where the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was witnessed.  The tribulation is about to begin, and that's going to be the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Part 2, my friends.  This is huge, huge, huge stuff.  Not long after the Israelites entered the Promised Land for their wilderness journey, okay?  Right now, God is about to end the age of the Gentiles by sending Jesus Christ back, snatch His bride out of thin air.  And then, we're talking about the Israelites.  They've been wandering in the wilderness for the last 2,000 years.  God is about to bring them back in like He did at the end and bring them to the Promised Land.  You guys getting this?  King David is going to rule with Jesus.  His throne will be below Christ.  He will rule with Jesus soon after the Great Tribulation.  the millennial kingdom and again this is where he ruled before.  god is tying all of these things and he's coming back around again like he's done so many times.  this is huge huge huge stuff my friends huge stuff.  and jesus who is the second adam he will rule over all of israel and all of the world in the millennial kingdom.  Huge stuff.  And again, King Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem, including the third temple, including the second temple, all burned down to the ground.  Okay?  And this is right here.  And God's about to build the third temple right in this area in Israel, in Jerusalem.  Hebron is in the general's vicinity.  This is major, major, major stuff, my friends.  This is prophetic stuff.  If you can't see it, I'm sorry for you.  The rapture is imminent.  Jesus Christ is about to snatch his bride away.  And those who are left behind, including all the unsaved and all the backslidden Christians, they don't believe.  They're backslidden, but when they're left behind, they'll believe they won't think.  And all those who don't believe in the pre-tribulation rapture, when they're left behind, they'll believe they won't think.  It's going to be a horrendous time, a hellish nightmare for seven years.  God's going to just wreak havoc on this earth.  Satan and the Antichrist and the false prophet will wreak havoc as well.  God didn't intervene.  No flesh remained alive as it is.  Billions and billions and billions have died.  The most grotesque, awful, horrendous, horrific death imaginable, man.  Why go through all of that?  Jesus Christ is our only hope.  If you've never been saved, you're backslidden.  Pray the prayer.  There's six steps in the box below the video.  No one's guaranteed the next day, hour, minute, or second in your life.  If you'd like prayer for anything, contact me.  I pray for you every day without fail.  True Christians, witness and pray for the lost daily.  It's your job.  If you're not doing it, do it now.  If you are, great.  Look up, true Christians.  Our addiction draws nigh.  We fly soon.  May God bless you.  I don't want to see anyone spend forever languishing in hell in the lake of fire, especially Christians who were once saved, but now they've backslidden and they didn't believe it, and it's too late to change.  Like the... the rich man and the beggar, the rich man in hell, wanted to get out and just get a tip of water in his tongue.  Couldn't do it.  Share this video.  Share all my videos, all my sermons, and Christ will reward you in heaven for those who are saved, those who repent.  And again, look up.  True Christians are a different growth than the ivy flies to make.  God bless you.  Share, share, share.  Bye. ",
