            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you with the weekly perspective for the week ending 13 December 2019.  Well, here we are almost at the end of the year.  I'm going to make this a quick one.  I am on somewhat of a vacation.  But I'm going to stick to pretty much the precious metals on this update.  So here's one from RT, Russia Today.  Central banks worldwide buying up massive amounts of gold in a shift away from the U.S.  dollar.  This is according to Goldman Sachs.  It's on the RT website.  Gold prices will climb to $1,600 per ounce next year.  Wall Street Bank, Goldman Sachs projects.  It says central banks are consuming a fifth of the global supply of the yellow metal.  De-dollarization in central banks, demand from central banks for gold is biggest since the Nixon era, eating up 20% of global supply.  The head of global commodities research at Goldman, Jeff Curry, told Bloomberg.  Gold ready to join all-time high club as US dollar equities can't go up forever, come on the strategist.  This is in contradiction to an article put out about two days ago by JP Morgan that basically said you want to do well in 2020, you should short gold and go long stocks.  I'm not going to make a comment on that in this forum, but something to consider that these two major banks, Goldman and JP Morgan, Basically, I'm giving the public a different perspective at the same time.  This is from Schiff Gold, Peter Schiff's website.  Wealthy are hoarding physical gold.  Worlds rich are hoarding gold.  This is according to data buried in recent Goldman Sachs notes to clients.  In a note published over the weekend, Goldman recommended diversifying longer-term bondholders with gold, citing, quote-unquote, fear-driven demand for the yellow metal.  Hedge funds and other large speculators boosted their bullish bets on gold by almost 9% through the week of December 3, according to government data released last Friday.  So basically, it's pretty much a repeat of the last article that I showed you.  Kind of make this a triple play.  This is out of Yahoo Finance.  Wealthy people are stocking up on physical gold.  What Schiff was telling us from Dalton Sachs, as a recent investors who are bullish on gold, say it's the precious metals moment to shine.  I think it's going to 2,500, 3,000 an ounce in the 2020s because of climate.  The landscape for gold is hugely support. ",
