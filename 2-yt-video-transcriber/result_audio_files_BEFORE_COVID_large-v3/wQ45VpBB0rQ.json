            "text": "This video is sponsored by Skillshare.  The second most viewed video on this channel is a video I released four years ago called WTF is Cultural Appropriation.  A few years after release, I changed the title to SHOULD WHITE.  PEOPLE HAVE DREADLOCKS in all caps because, you know, clickbait.  What do you think about white people with dreadlocks?  Not even kidding, I get asked that like twice a week.  Now for the longest time.  I wondered why anyone thought I would give a shit what other people do with their hair.  And I really still don't give a shit what people do with their hair.  But eventually I learned that a lot of these people were actually asking me about this thing known as cultural appropriation.  Man, I miss those wild jump cuts.  He says as if he doesn't still use jump cuts.  Hi, I'm T1J.  So that cultural appropriation video from 2014 has always left me a little ambivalent.  While I still agree with much of it, it's far too short to really expose much of the nuance that's usually necessary for complicated topics like this.  Holy shit, this video is less than five minutes long.  Those were the days.  In that video, I largely dismiss most accusations of cultural appropriation as confusing or silly, while at the same time acknowledging that it's important for people to be sensitive to the history of disadvantaged groups.  But the main takeaway of that video, I would say, is the line that I repeated several times.  You're allowed to like stuff.  You're allowed to like stuff.  You're allowed to like stuff.  But of course, it's more complicated than that.  My channel used to be basically just a place where I vomited thoughts onto the internet with no real rhyme or reason behind it.  But these days, I try to be a little more mindful about what ideas I express and how I express them.  Even if there's something I fully believe, I try to think about how the audience might perceive or interpret my argument.  And it's also fair to say that my views and perspectives have evolved over time, as you would imagine.  It is very important to me not to inspire people towards ideas that I find to be toxic or harmful.  Even if I don't intend to spread bad ideas, I believe being a responsible creator involves consideration of how your ideas might be interpreted or misinterpreted.  Especially as a black dude, I don't ever want to be perceived as giving people permission to be racially insensitive.  And the best way that I've come up with to avoid that sort of thing, besides avoiding certain topics outright, which I do in some cases, is to provide contextualized arguments in anticipation of these perceptions.  And I definitely didn't do that in 2014.  So let's try it now.  And I know that there are hundreds and thousands of videos and articles on this topic already.  I just didn't want that old video to be my only contribution to this discussion.  So deal with it.  Probably the main issue with that video is a lack of clarity about what is and isn't cultural appropriation.  Now, I absolutely despise debates that hinge primarily on semantics.  And I think that's a big problem when we're talking about cultural appropriation.  Different people think of different things when they hear the word, and that's always a problem in any kind of discussion when people don't even agree on what words mean.  So for the purposes of this video, I'm going to try to define some terms so we're all on the same page.  In your future conversations on this topic, I encourage you to do the same.  So the verb appropriate generally has a negative connotation in English.  It usually refers to the taking or using of something without permission or to the exclusion of others.  For example, the legislature appropriated the tax revenue for corporate subsidies.  Or, my sonic fan art has been appropriated by a major brand for their clothing line.  So in this video, when we mention cultural appropriation, we are specifically referring to something that is potentially problematic.  But as I said in that video so many years ago, you're allowed to like stuff.  So this implies that it's possible to engage with other cultures without being disrespectful.  The most obvious example of this is what we will call cultural exchange.  A cultural exchange is when different aspects of culture are shared between different groups through prolonged interaction, often over the course of many decades.  Cultural exchange is why we watch anime in the West and why they listen to hip hop in Japan.  I think in my old video I hastily conflated cultural exchange with cultural appropriation, which is why the complaint seems strange to me.  And to be fair, a lot of the people who were complaining at the time made the same conflation.  I definitely saw kids on Tumblr yelling at people for wanting to learn Spanish.  But there's your lesson for today.  Don't base your political opinions on reactions to teenagers on social media.  Isn't that right, Sir Applesauce?  The difference between exchange and appropriation is that exchange generally happens mutually and on equal footing.  It happens between cultures that have interacted either personally or through shared media.  Appropriation, on the other hand, is one-sided and usually involves a dominant or privileged group taking things from a disadvantaged culture.  I should note that this is not to say that mutual exchange cannot happen between privileged and disadvantaged groups.  Because of the internet, for example, different groups share slang, memes, fashion, and all kinds of things all the time.  The problem with appropriation is when these aspects of culture are stolen with no respect, credit, or benefit given to the originators.  When we watch or even make anime or things inspired by anime in the West, we understand that it's a Japanese thing, and we give credit to them for creating it.  When Marks and Spencer, a British retailer and food seller, created a vegan wrap and named it after a traditional Indian dish called biryani, even though it did not resemble the dish in any way, that seems to be more like callously exploiting a foreign culture to increase the perceived value of your products.  There are also cases where people adopt traditional religious or cultural symbols that are considered sacred or significant just because they think it looks cool or for other frivolous reasons.  And again, it's just disrespectful.  Like, why be an asshole?  A lot of white people lose their entire minds if they see someone who isn't a veteran wearing military badges or uniforms.  If you don't believe me, just search stolen valor on YouTube.  It's the same thing.  But with cultural appropriation, it goes beyond disrespect.  Cultural appropriation can have the effect of further contributing to marginalization.  When dominant groups take from marginalized groups and gain or profit from that appropriation without sharing any benefits or giving any credit, it can reinforce that societal imbalance.  White people, for example, are often perceived as innovative, unique, or edgy when they borrow certain hairstyles and fashion from other cultures.  Meanwhile, the people from those groups face discrimination and stereotypes for the exact same traits and behavior.  I feel like she smells like patchouli oil.  And I know this personally, as a guy who has missed out on several opportunities because my appearance was not perceived as professional enough.  It should also be mentioned that sometimes people from disadvantaged groups adopt traits from the dominant group.  But this can generally be referred to as assimilation.  Assimilation is usually performed as a survival mechanism for non-dominant groups.  While it's true that a lot of black American women enjoy the look of straightened hair, they also know in the back of their heads that it's much harder to be perceived as presentable or professional without it.  Now just like any other video, I don't mean to talk about this subject like it's a black or white issue.  It's complicated.  Everything is complicated.  One of the things that makes this conversation tricky is yet another related subject, which we will call cultural appreciation.  Appreciation is when you participate in another culture, but you do it in a way that is respectful and informed and often with the approval of members of that culture.  A good example of this is if you were to marry someone with a different heritage or religion than you, and you decide to have a wedding ceremony that includes customs and iconography from outside your own culture.  Generally, this is done in a respectful way and with consent.  The problem is that it is often difficult or impossible for outside observers to tell the difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation.  And for some people, the distinction doesn't even seem to matter.  But as you might imagine, I don't personally advocate such a non-nuance point of view.  Earlier in the video, I shared an image of supermodel Karlie Kloss wearing a Native American war bonnet as an example of disrespectful cultural appropriation.  But Brazilian designer Oscar Metzava did something similar when creating a fashion line inspired by the Axaninca, an indigenous tribe in South America.  The difference here is that Metzava collaborated with actual representatives of the community and even paid royalties to the tribe.  For some, this may still not be enough, but to me this is a huge step up from wearing a war bonnet and an animal print bikini just to be edgy.  In my old video, which again was made in 2014 when Miley Cyrus was still doing stuff like this, I argue that Miley probably just likes hip hop and hip hop culture, which is fine.  But just a couple years later, it seemed like she decided to drop her association with the culture as if it were a bad habit, which casts suspicion on her supposed appreciation, and provides an example of borrowing from a culture, profiting from it, and then simply casting it aside.  23 is still a banger though, I don't care what anybody says.  But apparently she's doing hip-hop again, so I don't fucking know, man.  Avril Lavigne encountered a lot of criticism after releasing the video for her song Hello Kitty for what people thought were insensitive portrayals of Japanese culture.  However, Levine shot that video in Japan with the aid of a Japanese cast and crew, including a Japanese director.  And the video and song was well received in Japan by Japanese people.  In fact, it appears that the vast majority of people who were offended by the video were not themselves Japanese.  Which brings up another important point.  One of the reasons there's so much confusion and controversy around the cultural appropriation issue is because well-meaning white people have a bad habit of getting offended on behalf of other groups.  Often placing victimhood upon groups of people that have not claimed that victimhood for themselves.  I see this sort of white protector mentality a lot as a black dude, and I personally find it very off-putting.  Being an ally to people of color does not involve being a knight in shining armor, and it certainly doesn't involve speaking on their behalf.  And when you react to something without having the actual cultural experience to really know whether or not it's actually a problem, that makes it much harder for people to take legitimate complaints seriously.  So just as I don't intend to give people permission to be racist, I also don't endorse hopping on Instagram and starting a fight every time you see a white person with cornrows.  At the end of the day, I still don't care if white people have dreadlocks.  And I'm not really interested in attempting to mind read in order to determine whether or not any individual actually respects the culture they're participating in.  It's also important to understand, no culture or group is a monolith, and you will get different opinions if you ask different people.  My opinion is that all I can do is ask people to be thoughtful about how they engage with other cultures.  You're allowed to like stuff, but you should also think about how your interactions with that stuff affects marginalized people.  You should make sure you're not perpetuating a stereotype.  You should give credit, and if applicable, time and money to the groups that you're borrowing from.  You should probably avoid accessorizing with things that other groups find sacred, because that's just kind of a dick move.  And you should remember that people are more than their fashion, music, and slang.  They're humans.  They have issues and anxieties.  Especially when we're talking about humans from disadvantaged cultures.  To paraphrase a quote from Nicki Minaj, if you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, then you should also want to know what affects us, what's bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us.  You shouldn't not want to know that.  That's what I should have added to that old video.  That's just me though.  What do you think?  Thanks for watching and thanks to Skillshare.
