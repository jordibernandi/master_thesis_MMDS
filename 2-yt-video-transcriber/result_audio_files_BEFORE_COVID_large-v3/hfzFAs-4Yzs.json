            "text": "right.  what's going on?  guys welcome to the video so it seems these will be coming thick and fast.  today we had a group of ramonas trying to stop boris johnson from arriving at buckingham palace to meet with the queen before taking up the office as prime minister.  let's check it out.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Camera please.  Go Brickley!  thank you.  So as you can see there, this group of Ramonas, probably numbering around 10 at most, have attempted to stop Boris Johnson arriving.  It's completely ridiculous.  And the police waste no time in shutting that shit down, which is one thing we can actually say for the police.  They have not fucked about in this instance.  It's a shame they don't do that with the rest of the crime that goes on.  Right, but I'm going to end the video there.  It was just a quick one to show you that.  Let me know what you think down in the comment section below.  Of course, this is going to be quite funny.  I'll enjoy reading them.  Remember to like, subscribe and share this video as it helps the channel a lot.  And I will see you all in the next one. ",
