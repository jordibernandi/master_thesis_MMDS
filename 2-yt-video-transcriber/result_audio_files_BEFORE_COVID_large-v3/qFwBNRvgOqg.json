            "text": "Hi brothers and sisters, it's Pastor Tim Henderson and it is the early morning hours.  I have to share this information with you.  On Nisan 1, the Jewish New Year, Barack Hussein Obama is going to be in Berlin.  At the seat of Satan making a speech.  This is not the first time that he has been at that exact location.  And things that he has said have had major prophetic implications.  This is truly significant.  That is April 6th.  There are so many things aligning for April 6th.  Wow.  I just want to get on.  And share that information with you.  It was actually as I was going through the emails.  And wow did that take a while.  If you have not heard from me.  You've sent an email.  I have gone through every email.  There are things going on.  And I know this is spiritual in nature.  There are attacks.  Things are heating up.  It's because we are in those final moments.  We.  I like what some of you say.  We're going to fly soon.  Praise God.  But I want you to know.  That.  It was you, the channel family, that through the emails where several of you were sending, Pastor Tim, do you know this?  And then my brother Greg, as I was getting ready to leave, I saw he sent a video link of, I can't remember who else.  Somebody else did a video on this.  But because this is a channel family, I want to make sure that you get this information.  So it's coming out.  Others are reporting the very same thing.  This is huge.  This is significant.  Keep your eyes on April 6th.  I'll tell you what, it's exciting times we're living in.  This is the most exciting time in church history.  Do not... Do not allow yourself to get distracted with the naysayers, the mockers.  And I want to remind you of something.  In Ephesians chapter 1, as a born-again believer, You are indwelt with Holy Spirit.  That means that greater is he who's in you than he who's in the world.  The same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead abides in you.  You have resurrection power in you.  Christ, as Ephesians 1 says, is our head.  We are his body.  Therefore, all power, dominion, rule, and authority is under his feet.  Many of you have been reporting spiritual attacks, oppression.  You are seated as an heir of God and a co-heir with Jesus Christ.  You are seated with him.  See yourself that way and know you have authority over those demons.  They're low-level demons.  You have authority in the name of Jesus Christ.  Just take authority over that.  You take authority.  Even the youth in the church and even the children.  I teach my grandchildren.  If you're afraid, if you're frightened, if something's frightening you, say, leave in the name of Jesus.  My little grandson, Peter, who's not yet three.  He'll be three in May.  He'll stomp his feet and he says, no devil, no devil in Jesus' name.  He knows.  He knows.  The faith of a child.  Brothers and sisters, be of good cheer.  Jesus is coming very soon.  We must occupy and redeem the time.  I am so thankful for every person that we get to bring the gospel of grace to.  Don't worry about the... Listen, if you are on here and you don't get this... that the precious blood of Jesus that was shed on the cross of Calvary paid the debt for your sin.  All sufficient.  It was all sufficient.  Praise God.  2 Corinthians 5.21, God made him who knew no sin to become sin, that we might become the righteousness of God.  Our sin was imputed to him and his righteousness imputed to us.  Oh, praise God.  You know what's going to come after the rapture?  Well, this is how I see it happening.  Tomorrow night, I'm going to do just a timeline.  And then we're going to talk about the millennial reign.  And I really want you to know before we're out of here.  I believe when we're raptured, when we're harpatoed, we're going to make a stopover to the bema seat, the judgment seat of Christ.  Because I've had visions of this.  And at that place, I don't know the words to use.  It's not, I don't want to say regret.  It's a knowing.  I just can't put a human... I can't put human words to it, but it's not condemning.  And those things that we did, you know, there are things that we do that we think we're doing with a pure motive, a pure heart.  And we're going to be a little bit surprised.  I was.  I was surprised.  Things that I would have thought, it was like, nope, your motive wasn't right.  That was the wood, hay, and stubble that burned up.  But things that I didn't even... Give any thought to just a kind gesture, a smile, something that brightened someone's day was so exponentially expanded as to rewards.  And then we go into the bridal chambers.  And I... Again, there's not human words.  It's not like what we experience in intimacy physically here.  The love... The love is... So overwhelming.  I can't put words to it.  I can't put words to it.  But I'll tell you what.  Glory to God.  I'm looking forward to that day.  Oh, praise God.  And it's coming very, very soon.  I know it in every fiber of my... I'm so excited I could jump out of my skin.  It's hard to sleep at times because after a day like today where I see people come to faith in Jesus Christ, that's just... That's glorious.  What's... What's more miraculous than that?  I just got a quickening.  If my sister Rosemary is watching this, I just want you to know God loves you fiercely and passionately.  He's especially fond of you.  I don't know why you need to hear that, but I love you too.  And to all of you, my brothers and sisters, God loves you fiercely and passionately.  He loves you so much.  He loves you so much.  Oh, praise God.  Well, I won't keep going on because I could keep going on.  I am looking forward to worshiping with my brothers and sisters tomorrow at jay creek and those of you who can join.  if you can't join at the time because you have your own fellowship you can watch later.  really the message that holy spirit is stirring within me is is a is a really um.  Simple, I don't know if that's the right word, but basic message, but it's so powerful as well.  So I pray you can join us and I pray you are blessed.  I pray sweet rest to you tonight, wherever you are in the world.  Just know he loves you and I love you too.  Hopefully you can join tomorrow.  God bless. ",
