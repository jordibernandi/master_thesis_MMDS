            "text": "Hey, Instagram family.  Welcome to Sergeant Dorsey Speaks.  I'm a retired 20-year veteran sergeant with the Los Angeles Police Department.  And I wanted to share with you a story that's being much debated right now on social media.  And this involves a young man by the name of Corporal Michael Green over in Maryland.  Now, Corporal Michael Green is 31 years old.  He's a 10-year veteran officer of the Prince George's County Police Department.  And listen, I don't know who Michael Owen pissed off, but clearly Michael Owen pissed somebody off because a couple of days ago, and I've never seen this happen in the history of ever family.  So, you know, and it'll be clear to you in just a minute why I think, and probably some of you think this is going down the way that it's going down.  But a couple of days ago, um, corporal Michael Owen responded to a radio call of a gentleman by the name of, William Green.  He's 43 years old and allegedly he had been involved in a traffic collision with several vehicles.  Officers encountered Mr.  Green and it was believed that maybe he might have been under the influence of PCP.  Now they said, officers said they thought they smell PCP, so they had taken him into custody, handcuffed him, and because the patrol car that Michael Owen was driving didn't have a partition separating the front seat from the back area, which is where you would normally see the suspect, Mr.  Green was handcuffed and placed in the front seat as the officers requested and was awaiting a drug recognition expert.  Now, this is where it gets a little kind of questionable to me because it sounds like there was more than one officer on the scene.  It wasn't just Michael Owen, right?  And so they are requesting a drug recognition expert.  And they said all of this happened within five to 10 minutes of taking Mr.  Green into custody.  What ultimately happened is, well, we don't know.  But what we do know is that 10 minutes later, Mr.  Green was dead from seven gunshot wounds at the hands of Corporal Michael Owen.  Now, Michael Owen has been arrested and charged.  Listen, it hadn't even been 24 hours hardly before the police chief charged him with get a load of this second degree murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, first degree assault and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime.  Now I wonder if it's because That's Michael Owen right there, family.  You see what he looks like.  Me and some of you.  Because listen, I have not seen a police chief move so swiftly to charge an officer who's been involved in a deadly shooting ever, right?  I mean, this reminds me shades of Mohammed Noor, right?  The Minnesota officer who shot and killed Justine Damon, who had come out after she called the police because she thought there was some kind of a, assault occurring in an alley and she startled allegedly Mohammed Noor, who was a Somali officer there in Minnesota, and he wound up shooting across his partner.  He was on the passenger side, shot across his partner through the driver's door window and killed this woman.  Well, they didn't have a problem figuring out what to do with Mohammed Noor.  And listen, Folks are asking me to keep an eye on this and let's follow it.  I'm gonna follow it, but y'all already know.  You already know.  That's Michael Owen.  He's been charged with second degree murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, first degree assault and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime.  What?  Ooh wee.  They mean to make an example out of Michael Owen.  And so, you know, listen.  Now that's not to say that what he did wasn't inappropriate.  That's not to say, and I'm not trying to infer that, because there's just too many unknowns about this shooting.  What the heck?  Seven times you shoot somebody?  Is he sitting in the car with him on the driver's side when he shoots Mr.  Green seven times?  I don't know.  Varying narratives.  There were obviously other officers that were there.  There were other independent witnesses, civilians who arrived on scene, said they saw something, thought they heard something.  And we know that generally great deference is given to what a police officer says with regards to a deadly shooting and, you know, why they probably were scared and fired seven times, right?  In this case, no deference because that's Michael Owen.  No deference was given.  And so now the police chief says, hey, look, I can't explain why he fired seven times.  And, um, the police chief also said, you know, he doesn't know if green was wearing a seatbelt, if he had actually been seatbelted in when he was shot.  Now we do know that he was handcuffed, but again, it's not uncommon for someone who's handcuffed to slip the cuffs.  In other words, to get their hands from behind their back.  If they're limber, I've seen it happen myself in my 20 years in patrol.  Right.  get their hands from behind their back and bring them to the front.  I haven't heard that, so I'm not saying that that was the case, but it could happen.  How and why, for what reason, Michael Owen felt a need to shoot this guy seven times is yet to be discovered, yet to be known.  But he did, and William Green died.  And there were two other witnesses who said again that they either heard or saw a struggle.  And now the police chief is saying, well, look, um, ordinarily great difference is given to an officer's version.  But the police chief is saying, you know, we can't corroborate what the officer said.  Owen, we can't corroborate that.  And even though the witnesses may have said the civilian witnesses may have said they thought they heard or saw something that looked like sounded like a struggle.  The police chief says, I think a crime occurred.  Thus, one, two, three, four, five charges against Michael Owen.  And he's being held right now on no bond.  So I don't know what to make of it.  But what I do know is that Michael Owen got some explaining to do.  And listen, this is not the first time that he's taken a life.  It's reported that back in 2011, he was involved in another fatal crime.  Take that back.  It wasn't a fatal shooting as far as we know, but he was involved.  Oh no, it was a fatal shooting.  Okay.  He's been involved in three shootings.  2011, it was a fatal shooting.  This involved a 35 year old by the name of Rodney Edwards, who was shot several times.  Now it doesn't say how many, it just says several.  And what happened is that, um, Owen, Corporal Owen was leaving some kind of toys for Todd event.  He was off duty playing clothes, but I think he might've been in a police, unmarked vehicle.  and as he was leaving this event he saw Rodney Edwards laying on the grass on the side of the road.  so he decided he being Michael Owen, Corporal Owen decided to get out and check and make sure the guy was okay.  something happened between the two of them.  according to Corporal Owen great deference was given to his version of events back in 2011 and it turned out that Mr.  Edwards did have a gun that was recovered.  Owen fired again several shots and killed Rodney Edwards.  Now, Owen was not charged.  They took his word back in 2011.  And two years before that, Corporal Michael Owen, he seems to be like a shit magnet, right?  Now he's off duty at home and somebody tries to rob him, says he.  And so he's Fires off a bunch of shots.  Says the suspect fires off a bunch of shots.  Suspect flees.  They never find him.  No harm, no file.  Nobody's charged.  Nobody shows up, you know, with a, you know, gunshot in the backside.  So that was 2009. then 2011 fatal shooting of 35 year old Rodney Edwards.  And now we have the fatal shooting of William Green.  So prosecutors are going to be taking a look at this fatal shooting from 2011.  They're going to be reviewing it to see if everything was kosher, right?  If, if what corporal Michael Owen said happened actually happened.  And I don't know.  Um, I don't know.  But, um, There are several other incidents that have occurred recently over there in Prince George's County because they don't seem to have their officers equipped with body cameras.  Michael Owen didn't have one the other night.  There was no body camera in the other shootings.  And then there was a report of a fatal shooting in September and October of last year.  Again, no body cameras.  So I don't know what's going on over there.  I don't know if it's a funding issue that they have not equipped their officers with body cameras.  to help answer some of these questions, but there's a lot of them.  And so I will keep you posted with regards to this incident because I've been asked to do that.  And I'm just curious to see what are they gonna do when a police officer looks like that and he shoots somebody seven times who's sitting right next to him, allegedly, seemingly in a police car.  We'll see.  I think I know the outcome.  What do you think?  Let's talk about it.  That's it for now, family.  Thank you for tuning in.
