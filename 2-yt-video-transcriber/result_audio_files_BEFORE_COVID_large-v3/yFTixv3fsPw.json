            "text": "Glass bottom boats are over here in the Friday.  Firework boats over there.  Hi family.  How y'all doing?  Welcome to another one of our videos here on our YouTube Frank 26 YouTube channel.  This is a place where.  It used to have a fisherman's wharf next door.  All that's left is just the sign.  It was an icon here.  It was here like for about maybe 50 something years.  It was a good restaurant.  That's down in the corner.  But this is the, what is this?  This is the marina and all the boats that take you out for deep sea fishing.  Firework display on Fridays.  The glass bottom boats.  You can have dinner cruises.  Oh, there's some really good ones.  The Akikane is a good one.  What's the one that we went on this year, Tink?  If you can remember it.  I think, did I go with you?  Pride of Aloha?  Yeah, I think it was the Pride of Aloha, in fact.  Beautiful dinner cruises.  They go out towards Diamond Head, and the sun is just starting to set, so they turn around, and they catch the sun setting.  Isn't that perfect?  On a Friday, as the sun sets, they also stop, and you can see the fireworks.  You can literally reach out and touch something.  but in this marina you can find all types of uh of fishing uh water sports uh skiing.  uh with the parachute though what is that parasailing?  you know we like to do that as well but one time one time.  oh look at there's the friday a friday night firework.  you can pick it up right here and there's their um their website if you want to look it up family in case you're coming down.  but anyways what happened was that my wife and i and our son and our daughter we wanted to go deep sea fishing and we went to um jack in the box.  that's kind of like the equivalent of a taco bell here and we got this bowl with rice and some fish.  and what was it called?  it was a teriyaki bowl.  yeah the chicken teriyaki bowl and my daughter.  well we all ate these bowls.  we had a good time.  uh don't eat before you go out into the ocean because when we got on that boat right over there you can see it says private charter.  you see it says uh six and and up to 135 whatever there.  Well, I rented it and I told the captain, I said, I'd like to go deep sea fishing.  So we did.  But I had no idea that the horizon was going to disappear.  Did you know it was going to happen, Tink?  No.  Nope.  Our children didn't know.  Nope.  And when the horizon, well, you see, you can see the skyline, and then you couldn't see it anymore, and it was just water that way, that way, that way, and that way.  I mean, there was even water, I think, that way.  I know there was water that way.  We were, it was just water.  And, you know, the boat was, you know, and after you do that for how long was the thing?  was it five five and a half hours?  i had no idea that the hawaiian i know.  okay i know all the different kind of fish that we have here.  uh he's the tuna.  but um i had no idea that there was a fish called ralph.  ralph did you know that?  well no i don't think.  even if you google it it won't do any good.  but what happened was that what did the captain tell my?  our son if you're feeling ceaseless do not go inside and lay down.  so what did our son do?  he went inside He laid down.  It didn't take him much longer after that.  We found him.  He was leading over the rail and he kept calling for this fish by the name of Ralph.  He'd go, Ralph!  And I'd look down and I'd go, well, I don't know Ralph, but must be a different species down there.  But every five seconds, Ralph!  Poor kitty.  It took him a day to recover, didn't it?  No, don't ever go and eat before you go on a long charter boat ride.  And by the way, Babe, tell them what you caught.  I mean, we cast these big lines.  They set up about six of these lines.  Tell them what you caught, babe.  I caught the top zipper part of a Ziploc bag.  The top zipper part of a Ziploc bag.  Wow.  It was an experience.  We were emotional.  I'm like, for $500?  Really?  Okay, so it's my turn, right?  I'm casting out there.  Yes, sir.  Ralph or no Ralph.  Here we go.  All of a sudden, ding, ding, ding, ding.  I got a bite.  You see, they put this little bell on the pole.  It was cool.  And then this rubber band, it just flies and it tells you you got a fish.  So the captain says, reverse and put it around and spin.  And I'm just fighting with the pole.  Next thing I know, I'm reeling in.  It's getting easier.  Oh, yeah.  You're doing good, son.  Reel it in.  Reel it in.  Okay, let go.  Reel it in.  Oh, we can see it.  We can see it.  Somebody get the net.  Somebody get the net.  My heart, I mean, I like... i told you and i said back watch this.  oh there it is dangling off the hook.  it was about a six inch tuna but it was pretty.  it was my tuna shoot and my son.  i hit poor guy.  he saw the tuna.  he went.  Funny enough, though, our daughter, she's strong, by the way.  Congratulations, sweetheart.  She got another world ranking today.  Two.  Two world rankings, yeah.  A first and a second, wasn't it?  Yep.  I'm so proud of my girl.  Anyways, for what it's worth, I just wanted to make this video on our YouTube channel to let you know that you can come here.  It's right across the street from the Ward Center.  If you look over here, you can zoom in.  Can you zoom in on that thing?  And let them see that it says the Ward Center.  There's not much left of it because over here on the right-hand side, they tore it all down.  all of the lord center is gone all the way up there.  to that uh the theaters that they have over there and behind it is a whole food.  so right across this area you'll find the marina that we're talking about.  right here you can see the people are getting on on this one And those people are getting ready.  Oh, look at the dog.  Poor dog.  Get ready, dog.  You're going to meet Ralph.  Poor dog.  You don't know what he's going to experience.  Anyways, God bless you.  Aloha.  Thank you.  Listen, some of you are asking, well, why is Frank doing this?  11 years ago, I started at KTFalways.com and I helped you answer your questions.

I'd like to introduce you to the persona of Frank 26.  This is what my YouTube channel is all about.  It's not to talk to you about the things that I talk to you already at KTFalways.com, okay?  I want to make sure that I'm separating the two.  This is just me.  I want you to know me.  And you know that I love things that are good for the body, right?  Good health.  I'll be talking about products that do that.  You know that I love to cook.  51, going on 52 years, my family restaurant, the oldest Mexican restaurant in the city of Toledo, El Tipico, 1444 South Street, Toledo, Ohio, 43609.

I see your comments.  I see your post.  And I see that some of you are just maybe not understanding.  You don't mean to be rude.  You don't mean to be immature.  That's what this YouTube is about.  Okay?  I love you.  Y'all take care, all right?  I got to go see Ralph.  I hope all those people didn't just finish eating.  What do you think, Ting?  I hope not, too.  I hope not, too.
