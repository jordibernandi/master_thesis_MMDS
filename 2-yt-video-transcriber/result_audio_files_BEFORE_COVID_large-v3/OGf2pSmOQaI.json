My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we unlearn the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  If that sounds interesting to you, then subscribe to this channel and click the bell to be notified when new teachings are available.  Now let's get started.  The term born again is used frequently among Christians, but often without context or explanation.  Someone might ask, are you a born again Christian?  Or, have you been born again?  Often without explaining what they mean by born again.  It seems that many people think being born again simply means you're a Christian.  But is that what the Bible says?  Listen to what Yeshua said to Nicodemus about being born again.  Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old?  Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?  Jesus answered, Do not marvel that.  I said to you, you must be born again.  The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes.  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.  There's some very important information in this dialogue that I want to point out and discuss.  Yeshua said, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  And unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.  Because that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  These statements were confusing to Nicodemus.  Which is why he asked, how can a man be born when he is old?  Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?  Nicodemus understood that before one can be born, they must first be conceived in a womb.  A baby spends nine months in a womb before it's born.  And the Bible indicates that we have a spiritual conception before our birth as well.  For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly awaits for the revealing of the sons of God.  For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs, together until now.  Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our  body.\".  Paul says the sons of God have not yet been revealed, indicating they are still in the womb, because they are currently groaning with birth pangs.  Conception comes before labor pangs, and labor pangs come before birth.  We also find in the Bible that we are compared to seeds that are sown in the ground.  But some will say, how are the dead raised up?  And with what body do they come?  Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.  And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain, perhaps wheat or some other grain.  But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body.  Paul is talking about the resurrection of the dead, and he explains our current body is like a seed that must first die before it can become the new life it is meant to be.  He goes on to explain that we have a natural body now, but we will have a spiritual body at the resurrection.  So also is the resurrection of the dead.  The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.  It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory.  It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.  It is sown in natural body, it is raised as spiritual body.  There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  And so it is written, the first man Adam became a living being, the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.  However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.  Remember that Yeshua said, We must be born of the Spirit to enter the kingdom of God.  And that which is born of flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  Keep that in mind as we continue reading.  The first man was of the earth, made of the dust.  The second man is the Lord from heaven.  As was the man of the dust, so also are those who are made of dust.  and as is the heavenly man so also are those who are heavenly.  and as we have borne the image of the man of dust we shall also bear the image of the heavenly man.  now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does corruption inherit incorruption.  behold i tell you a mystery.  we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  Yeshua said we must be born of the Spirit to enter the Kingdom of God.  And Paul said that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.  Yeshua said that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  Paul said it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.  There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.  Paul is explaining what Yeshua said to Nicodemus.  He's talking about the resurrection.  And he says that in the resurrection we will receive our new spiritual bodies.  Our mortal body will die and go into the ground.  But we will be resurrected with a new spiritual body.  Paul said that we currently bear the image of Adam, the man of the flesh.  But he says we shall bear the image of Yeshua, the heavenly spiritual man.  Flesh life comes from a fleshly father.  Spirit life from a spiritual father.  Paul also explains that this will happen at the last trumpet, which is a reference to the return of the Messiah and the resurrection of the dead.  For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.  We receive our spiritual body at the resurrection, and this is what it means to be born of the Spirit.  That which is born of flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.  Some people argue that we have already been born of the Spirit.  But as I pointed out earlier, the Bible says we are currently in labor pains, indicating we have not been born yet.  However, we have received the deposit of the Holy Spirit in our lives.  When we came to faith, we were sealed and marked by the Holy Spirit as a guarantee of our inheritance.  In him you also trusted.  after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.  To the praise of his glory.  We will receive our inheritance when we enter the kingdom at the resurrection, when Messiah returns.  Flesh and blood cannot enter the kingdom, which is why we must be born of the Spirit.  This spiritual life has been conceived in us, but the birth will take place when we receive our new spiritual bodies.  So the next time someone asks you if you've been born again, you can say, not yet, but I will be at the resurrection when Messiah returns.  Thanks for watching.
