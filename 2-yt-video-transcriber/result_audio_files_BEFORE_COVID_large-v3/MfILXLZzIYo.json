I'm running for president of the United States because I believe we're in a battle for the soul of this nation.  I believe that everyone, and I mean everyone, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.  And I believe that the American dream is big enough for all of us.  I mean all of us.  Latinos have contributed so much to our country.  Whether you've been here for generations or whether you're a dreamer whose family arrived recently, you're part of the fabric of America.  You're Americans.  And when I'm president, I'll stand with you for the battles that are about to come.  I'm optimistic.  I remain optimistic and continue to be optimistic that if we work together to fulfill the ideals of this nation, value hard work, opportunity, and the American dream, we'll get there.  This is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we need the leadership of the Latino community, your voices and your votes.  I hope you'll join me as we continue to build on the progress we've made and reminding our leaders that families belong together, together.  That's our American family.  We belong together, all of us.  May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. ",

            "text": "Have you ever heard someone so full of shit?  Don't answer that, because you could probably think of a lot of people.  Once again, Trump campaign.  Trump himself showing that they completely control social media and dominate this new social media political game.  They're completely untouchable with it.  And it goes to further prove here, with this rollout that Joe Biden tried to do the other day, completely unsuccessful, of course, the Todus Con Biden.  Well, not so much, as Trump grabs domain name.  Democrat Joe Biden has launched a Latino support network, but the presidential hopeful got trolled soon after when the website matching his outreach movement's name was snatched up by Donald Trump's re-election effort.  Absolutely masterful trolling.  What is this man and his campaign doing?  Obviously nothing.  Obviously it's just complete platitudes, virtue signalling.  And if you watch that video that I just put in the start, absolutely full of shit.  Because actions speak louder than words.  And in this case, Biden didn't even bother to buy the domain name any urls either not even the twitter account.  he didn't lock down.  now anyone that has ever started something whether it's a campaign uh a company even a youtube channel the first thing you always do is you either lock down domains you start emails right you You get all that sorted first.  That's groundwork.  That's basic stuff.  Right?  This campaign didn't even lock down the website.  And it shows you, that inaction in itself shows you how much this man does not give a shit.  One about his campaign and two about Latinos.  He's trying to push this thing like he completely loves you in every way, shape or form, pretty much virtue signaling to you.  And Trump's completely called him out on it and has dominated it.  So if you look over here, we go into the website.  Trump has not only claimed it, but he's now using it against Biden, completely weaponized it.  And this is just the master troll at work.  And this is why a lot of people love Trump, whether you're not in the political field or not.  You can't look at this and not find it absolutely hilarious.  How he's completely weaponized, caught out his opponent and mocked him.  It's absolutely a joke.  uh so let's let's look over here.  the former vice president rolled out titus con biden all with biden on wednesday to boost latino support for his white house bid but the team failed to purchase the url with the name of his program by early thursday.  the page taurus combined and reads oops joe c olavido de los latinos.  i need to work on my latin i can speak ashwagandha struggle with Latin.  With the English translation, oops, Joe forgot about Latinos.  The site directs users to the Latinos for Trump's webpage, which includes news about Trump's effort to attract Hispanic voters.  Volunteer opportunities and donation button.  If you go, I recommend you definitely go to Twitter and definitely join this Twitter account.  that Trump's locked down.  completely just calling ahead, dominating Joe Biden.  I don't know what this man is doing.  Is he running for anything?  Is this just to sell books?  Like, I don't understand.  It's... He's not going to get into the White House like this.  I mean, he wasn't going to anyway.  He's been getting smashed by Trump all around the field, calling him out.  Seems like he's losing his mind.  He's forgetting things.  And that's exactly what Trump has capitalized on, especially if you watch some of these videos.  Separation.  We need family separation.  We need family separation.  Oh, God. ",

            "text": "Oh, God.  Absolutely amazing.  But this is it's absolutely goes to show you the amount of domination Donald Trump has when it comes to social media presence.  He knows what he's doing.  His team knows what he's doing.  So you're never gonna beat him in that field.  I don't think anyone's gonna beat him anyway.  Definitely not in this election.  But this is this is just absolutely masterful by Trump and great to say.  I want to say what else I His social media team can jump on before the end of 2020 and before the start of these elections because this is some funny stuff.  But definitely go in there.  Join this.  Have a look at the TotusCon Biden page.  Paid for by Donald J. Trump.  Absolute master.  And Joe Biden got completely owned on this one.  So this is great to see. ",
