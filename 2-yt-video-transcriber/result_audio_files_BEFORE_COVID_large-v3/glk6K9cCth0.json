            "text": "An update on a story we first reported last week on a suspect shot and killed by San Antonio officers trying to arrest him on a felony warrant.  San Antonio's police chief said 45 year old Randy Goodale was shot to death after ramming his truck into occupied police vehicles.  But surveillance video obtained by our defenders tonight cast doubt on that account of what happened.  Dylan Collier examines the footage in this defender's report.  Now we have a warning.  Some viewers may find this story disturbing. ",

            "text": "But now, the video showing surveillance footage of the shooting calls the chief's account into question.  A note, the arrow cursor shown on screen is part of the original video, was not added by us, and should not be construed to imply that any of the officers in the frame committed misconduct.  Goodale is in the parked red truck, backed into a driveway as both marked and unmarked law enforcement vehicles pull up to the home.  Members of the task force and SAPD support officers get out and fan out around the truck.  Fifteen seconds after a weapon is first pointed at Goodale, he is fired at.  Only after the shots are fired at the truck does it move forward and make contact with the task force minivan.  A large plume of smoke then appears, likely coming from the truck's tires spinning.  Goodale was removed from the truck and taken down the block, where he was pronounced dead.  The chief's claim that the vehicles were occupied is also in doubt, as the footage shows the driver and all three passengers in the van outside of the vehicle when the truck drifts into it, and the driver of the black truck getting out after the shots were fired, but before the red truck rolls down the driveway.  The owner of the home and surveillance system told the defenders he took steps to hide the footage out of fear that officers would destroy it and that Goodale had been working on the truck in the moments leading up to his death.

Chief McManus provided information at the scene as the investigation was just underway.  As always, this is preliminary information and subject to change as the investigation unfolds.  Surveillance videos are important.  However, they don't always provide the full scope of an officer's perception.  For example, there is no audio in the video you obtained, so you cannot hear what the officers are experiencing.  In addition, you cannot see what the suspect is doing, so you do not know what the officers are perceiving.  The SAPD officer-involved shooting team is conducting an investigation.  At the conclusion of the investigation, the results will be forwarded to the Bexar County District Attorney's Office for an independent review.  An SAPD spokeswoman also confirming its officers have now been removed from that federal task force.  For the Defenders, Dylan Collier, KSAT 12 News. ",
