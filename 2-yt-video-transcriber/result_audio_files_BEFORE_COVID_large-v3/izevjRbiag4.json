            "text": "The thing about climate change is it's serious stuff, very serious.  It's not like the frivolous concerns that fill your days, like paying your bills or keeping your marriage together or putting your kids through school or fighting cancer.  Climate change is bigger than that, way bigger.  It's about saving the earth.  It's about taking on what we're going to call an existential threat to humanity.  It's a big deal, man.  Nobody understands the gravity of climate change with quite the soul-searing intensity of freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  When Ocasio-Cortez talks about climate change and the Green New Deal she promises will save us from climate change, she often looks like she's going to start to cry or start to yell or both.  And why wouldn't she?  It's scary as hell.  Time is running out. ",

            "text": "Now, you can disagree with the details of the Green New Deal she's proposing, banning cars and airplanes, for example, shutting down the entire American energy sector, rebuilding every dwelling in the United States.  You can disagree with that.  But what you can't question is Ocasio-Cortez's sincerity.  When she talks about climate change, clearly she really means it.  Or does she?  This is a man called Sykat Chakrabarty.  He's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff over in the Congress.  He personally led the writing of the Green New Deal.  The Washington Post just profiled Chakrabarty.  In the interview, Chakrabarty made a stunning admission.  All that stuff about the world ending, 12 years to save the planet, it was all a lie.  Chakrabarty is not worried about humanity's demise.  The Green New Deal has nothing to do with that.  Here's what he told the paper, quote, The interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn't originally a climate thing at all.  Do you guys think of it as a climate thing?  Because we really think of it as a, how do you change the entire economy thing?  End quote.  That's about as direct as it could be.  The Green New Deal is not designed to save the world.  It's not about the environment at all.  It's about power.  Chuck Rabarty and Ocasio-Cortez want control of the American economy.  They went looking for an issue that would justify a hostile takeover of the economy.  Climate change seems scary, so they went with that.  It's remarkable they're admitting this, but we shouldn't be surprised it's happening.  This kind of thing happens all the time.  Manufacturing crises is the last preferred way to exert control over the country.  A decade ago, for example, only wackos in bed sheets were called racists.  Then, during the last election, Donald Trump was denounced as a racist.  Now Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are being written off as racists.  What's going on here?  It's not like there's more racism in the country.  In fact, there's much less than there used to be.  What changed is that the left realized they could gain power by creating boogeymen, by scaring you.  Stupefy the masses with fear-mongering.  By the time they've recovered, you're the one in charge.  Well, AOC's team say they saw global warming as a pretext for taking over the economy.  That doesn't mean their plan was based on evidence of an actual problem.  Because despite what they tell you, the science is not settled.  We can all agree that the climate is warming, temperatures are going up, but we are not sure why.  Researchers in Finland have released new work arguing there is little to no evidence at all that the increase in temperature is being driven by the actions of people.  Summarize for us these findings.  This is a Japanese and Finnish study.  What did they uncover? ",

            "text": "This new study basically is saying that humankind does not have any kind of control on the climate, that man's influence has essentially been undetectable in the climate record.  And the study is finding that clouds are a much more important control knob, if you will, of the climate.  Now, it's just one study.  The key here is climate skeptics don't jump on one study, but we say there are hundreds of factors that influence the climate.  Tilts of the Earth's axis, water vapor, methane, volcanoes, and all kinds of ocean cycles.  The idea that carbon dioxide is a control knob is not valid.  And I actually point out there's over 500 peer-reviewed studies within the last year debunking the idea that CO2 is the control knob.  This latest study on clouds is very important. ",

And what can we do about it?  So there seems to be a consensus on one.  There is not a consensus on two and three, the questions that matter.  Or am I misstating that? ",

WHY ARE THEY USING 1970 AS A BASELINE?  THAT WAS THE GLOBAL COOLING ERA.  IF YOU GO BACK TO THE MEDIEVAL WARM PERIOD, WE'RE PROBABLY THE SAME TEMPERATURE.  WE MAY HAVE COOLED.  IF YOU GO BACK TO THE ROMAN WARMING PERIOD, ABOUT ZERO  A.D.,  WE'RE PROBABLY COOL.  to the geologic history of the Earth, we're in the 10% coldest period of Earth's history.  In other words, 90% of the Earth's history was colder than today and didn't support ice on either pole.  So yes, we have warm since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850.  That's indisputable.  Has man contributed?  The United Nations claims man is responsible for the majority of the warming.  And they come up with a 95% confidence interval, which literally is a show of hands of selected activist authors, some of whom, like Michael Oppenheimer. ",
