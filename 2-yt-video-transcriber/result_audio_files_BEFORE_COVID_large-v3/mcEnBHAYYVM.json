I'm sure most people by now are familiar with that professional fake victim Jonathan aka Jessica Yaniv.  He's the dude who has filed more than a dozen complaints with the BC Human Rights Tribunal.  He has gone after women who offer waxing services to other females, demanding that he be treated as a woman, even though he's still equipped with male genitalia.  His case is that he's being discriminated against.  He is the victim, you see, and he wants to be financially compensated by taxpayers for his victimhood.  Speaking of which, Jonathan also likes getting around town on publicly funded transit rides for the disabled.  Sometimes he's even buzzing about in a mobility scooter, even though he's being caught on video running like someone taking part in the 100-meter dash.  What's the deal with that?  So I visited Vancouver recently to try and get some answers.  I should point out that Yaniv is now very much a public person, most recently taking to social media to bemoan the fact that he couldn't go swimming the other day because he was on his period.  No, seriously, he actually said that.  In any event, we feel that our questions to him are very much in the public interest.  We're not harassing him any more than journalists asking politicians questions are engaging in any kind of harassment.  In the video you're about to watch, please note that I never entered into his condominium lobby, but rather remained outside in the common area.  You will also see Jonathan swearing and threatening me and ultimately physically assaulting me merely for practicing journalism.  But don't take my word for it.  Check out the video evidence. ",
