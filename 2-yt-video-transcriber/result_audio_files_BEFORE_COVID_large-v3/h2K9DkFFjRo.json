I need someone to take me and slap me around and inspire me and motivate me in the flesh.  Well, it just so happens.  that's my job.  Did you know that's my job?  That's actually my job.  And if you click the link below, I'm actually in LA right now teaching social freedom, social freedom for dating courses, and this little crazy mixed course.  that's all about connecting deeper with other people, getting to know yourself better, opening up your heart, loving you more, attracting more of all the good stuff in your life, and not giving a fuck what people think.  So if that sounds good, click the link below.  Come and see me.  I want to see you in the flesh.  I want to hold you in my arms.  I want to love you.  I want to hug you.  I want to help you become the best version of yourself.  I know it's weird, but I like it. ",

I think that everyone has this ego that's built up through advertising or whatever it is throughout your life.  it's just being built and built and built and built and this is the only thing that I've experienced where it completely takes it down and destroys it.  and I think that we need to exercise that muscle more to kind of strip away all the kind of plaque that's built up over the years.

And those limiting beliefs are like, not gone, but they're 100% pushed down, like you're in your place.  So, it's amazing.  Social anxiety, being able to approach someone and being concerned with what they're thinking of me, what vibe I'm giving off, whether or not they're going to reject me or not.  The rejection part was probably the biggest part, and now I honestly... Obviously, there's still a little bit of stuff here and there, but I walked up to plenty of people, women, men, all of them, and I didn't have an issue with it.  And it was weird.  It was weird not having an issue with it.  What I wanted to do was not necessarily to have to just work with women.  I wanted it, obviously, to work with women because that's an important piece of my life.  But I think I see it from more of a larger scale where I can apply it to more pieces of my life than just... trying to hook up with women.  It's so much more.  The whole social freedom part of it is so true.  I feel like I can walk up to anyone here right now and just say whatever the hell.  I want to say.  And that's freeing. ",
