            "text": "All right, back onto a public sidewalk.  So what we have here is a cop waiting at the exit of the public road to follow me and another one up here on a public road waiting to follow me.  Well, I'm going to walk all the way to their police station, which is at the end of this road and then down through other stuff.  Oh.  Bye, coward!  So I guess now I have to walk.  No, there's another coward.  So four past me, five, six, seven.  We probably had seven cops.  Plus the prison dumped out a bunch of people.  All right.  Well, off to the police station to get some complaint forms.  So the police station is past that intersection down the hill.  It's a park and they're inside that park.  There ain't the end of the world to walk.  Not the end of the world to walk, so... Again, here's a private business that uses the same road.  That's that private business.  I was showing you guys with the UPS.  Truck backed into their loading dock.  This is for car entrances.  All trucks have to go to the next and then turn.  Defiant trespass.  I've had a defiant trespass charge against me.  Funny part is, hey coward!  Funny part is, is I beat that.  and won a nice settlement because of their tyrannical bullshit down at the non-federal reserve.  Assaulting me on a public sidewalk falsely arrested me.  I do have to start streaming live.  Alright, well, here's the light.  I go through that intersection, down the hill, through the park, and to the police station.  See them trespass me from a public park!  So, I asked them all the right questions.  They had no answer.  As soon as you start giving them sentences to show them that you're not going to be rolled over and bulldozed, and let you know a little bit about the law and how they're breaking it, is when the threats and violence come out.  Unreal.  So... Alright, I'll turn it back on when I get to the police station. ",
