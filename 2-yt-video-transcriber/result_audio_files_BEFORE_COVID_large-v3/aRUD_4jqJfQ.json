Plus, there's multiple witnesses.  And now he seems to have done something very stupidly, driving.  And witnesses have seen that this guy may have been the reason for this.  And now they're doing a cop's plane and a conspiracy.  And they're going to try to pit it against this innocent civilian here.  so we're going to cover this.  but this guy here this guy here man i welcomed him back to the fold so many times but he's so blue he don't know where he comes from anymore.

This vehicle has we build community on.  But the cop that almost T-boned this driver doesn't have one.  All right, guys, so here's the story in a nutshell.  The officer there that you've seen previously on video, the tall cop, Officer Trevor Thomas, was in some sort of pseudo pursuit of another vehicle at a high rate of speed.  without any emergency lights on or notifications that he's acting in an official emergency capacity.  When he came to the intersection here, this intersection here, a car was exiting out, getting ready to go east on Northwest 6th Street.  when, I'm sorry, it was going west on 6th Street.  It was making a left-hand turn at this intersection.  Officer Thomas was coming from east heading west in the westbound lane at a high rate of speed and had to severely swerve to avoid some t-boning the other driver.  At that point, the officer squished brakes and stopped all the way down by that building.  which is over 500 feet away from the intersection where the accident almost happened at because of the rate of speed.  Back this car back and stop pretty much where he is there.  Pull the lady over, call for backup.  And it seems to me at the point where I arrived, where they were conspiring to see what charges they can label against the other driver, who has incidentally not been charged in anything, no ticket issued, was not harmed, but she has left the scene.  So we're going to get a case number for this, and we're going to see the official report once it's made available.  But that is Officer Trevor Thomas.  I'm not sure of the badge number as of yet, but I'll see if I can get it.  Big Nick, South Florida Accountability, out. ",
