And the scary part is that she is a professor, if I'm not mistaken.  This is not just some random person on the street.  They have a little bit of credibility to them because they work in a college and they teach people.  These types of crazy things.  It's absurd, but let's see how she runs it on up. ",

            "text": "I would love to come to the Democratic debate in Milwaukee next year.  Thank you.  Wow.  Okay, that was something else.  So there you have it, folks.  According to this liberal, woke, possibly white lady, I'm not really sure, math is racist.  And the reason, I guess, from what I was able to glean from that is that you can use math in a racist way.  Like, one plus one is two.  That's normal.  But if I say... one plus one is two and i use it in a way that could be considered racist to people like her then that means that math is racist.  it's really weird.  uh scientific racism i mean come on if it's true it's true.  it doesn't even really matter whose feelings are hurt or who feels like it's targeting them for any kind of uh racial oppression or whatever.  it's irrelevant.  the fact is that Numbers are what they are.  If you think the numbers aren't true, then you have a case to make as far as the numbers being untrue.  But as far as the numbers themselves being racist, it's just ridiculous.  Anybody can say anything about anything.  I can say that black people love ice cream and therefore black people are just dumb because they like ice cream because I don't like ice cream.  I could say anything and then make it correlate to race.  That doesn't mean that the thing I use itself is racist.  That means that maybe I am a racist.  And if I say things that are true without putting unnecessary spin on it, then it's nothing you can say.  I'm just giving you information.  If I say there were a thousand shootings in these major inner city areas and 80% of them were black on black, you can't say I'm being racist.  I'm just giving you the information.  now if I say 80% of the shootings are black on black therefore nobody black should have guns ever then that's racist because you're denying people from having guns just because of their skin color.  many of them need the guns to protect themselves in these very violent and dangerous areas.  as I close I want to say this People like this can be kind of funny when you see them, but at the same time, it's not funny because these are teachers.  These people are in administrative roles.  They probably work for the news, social media conglomerates.  They have important roles many times, and they're teaching your kids about certain things.  When I was in Politicon over the weekend, I'll do a video about that shortly, I was sitting next to a young man, 20 years old.  He said that the whole Milo situation, I think it was at Berkeley, that was in their textbooks.  Okay, so people like that you just saw are putting the Milo thing in their textbooks and they're teaching it to your children, middle school, high school.  So when they get to college, It's no surprise that they out there wearing masks, throwing stuff and whatnot.  Some kids that are lucky enough to have good teachers, good parents, a good family structure, will be kind of shielded from this brainwashing.  But not everybody's as fortunate as those other kids are.  So people like this, you gotta watch out for them.  If you got your youngins in school right now, hey, go to the PTA meetings and see what's going on.  Talk to these teachers and see where they at, politically even.  so they're not teaching you kids garbage like what that super woke lady was talking about.  as far as math being racist but i think i'll leave that right there for now.  and what say you?  do you believe that math is racist?  if that's your viewpoint let me know why in the comments below because maybe i'm wrong maybe i missed something.  maybe math truly is racist and i'm just you know dismissing her unnecessarily and unfairly.  that could be the case i doubt it but if that is your case please make it in the comments.  or do you think that i'm correct?  it is absurd to think that math is racist.  either one plus one equals two or it doesn't.  and that's it.  whatever somebody does with it that's their business.  who cares?  that's that particular individual.  but the facts are the facts regardless of what.  One thing I was kind of surprised she didn't say, at least in a particular clip, was about how so-called students of color, more specifically blacks and Hispanics, not Asians, but I digress, they score lower on their math than everybody else.  But I didn't really hear that get brought up.  I'm sure she believes that as well.  And that may be part of the reason why she thinks math is racist, if she actually believes that, because I feel like some of them... don't actually believe in what they say.  maybe it's waiting for them to get woke brownie points and to stay employed wherever they are because it couldn't be a director from the top on down.  but whatever your comments are please let me know in the comments below and that's all i gotta say for this video.  if you like what you heard please comment rate share and subscribe.  peace.
