Anybody got a question?  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.  So the question from the young man in the crowd, is what gives me the authority to speak on behalf of a people who have so many hundreds or thousands of tribes all over this planet.  Well, what gives me the authority?  first and foremost is that I am one of the children of God.  What gives me the authority?  What gives me the authority?  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, but you see what's important?  what's important is that you've got to look at somebody who asked a question.  you've got to look at somebody who asked a question but they can't wait for the answer to the question.  their mouth is just flapping because they have an agenda and the agenda is not to ask a question and get an answer.  the agenda that you who want to focus on him because he's desperate.  He's desperate for some attention.  And those of you who give him the attention, you have just succumbed to his little plan.  Anybody got a question?  Anybody got a question?  No worries, brother.  No worries.  Have you got a question, brother?  I don't want to argue.  I want to ask a question.  My question is, I'm a Christian.  And I'm... We're not church.  We're Christian evangelists.  I'm asking a genuine question.  Okay, so the question from the gentleman in the front is that he's a Christian?  He's a Christian evangelist and he believes that at one point he has heard from the teachings of the most honorable Elijah Muhammad that we say that the Bible is the white man's religion or the Bible is the white man's book.  And where do we stand today on that position?  First of all, let me say it like this.  The Bible is part of the revealed word of God.  Hold on, hold on.  You ask a question.  You ask a question.  The Bible is part of the revealed word of God.  However, the white man, he took the Bible, King James in 1611, and there have been other interferences with the Bible.  As you know, if you are an evangelist and you are a Christian and a true believer in this book, then you will know that this book, many of the books have been taken out.  Many of the books have been taken... Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.  Now, I'm not taking no more questions because you're just making... No, no, no, no.  You see, brother?  You see, brother?  Look.  See, I've been coming here for a long time.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, brother.  Hold on, brother.  Hold on, brother.  I've been coming here for a long time.  I don't really... You know, I'm way beyond emotion, brother.  I'm really not into... No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  I'm really not here to play games.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Brother, brother, brother.  Brother, brother.  Brother, brother, brother.  Look, look.  Brother, brother.  Brother, brother.  Brother.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Anyway.  Sis... ",
