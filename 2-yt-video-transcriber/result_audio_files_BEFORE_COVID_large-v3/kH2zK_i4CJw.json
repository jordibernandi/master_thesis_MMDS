            "text": "No one owned a Bible 2,000 or 2,500 years ago.  And therefore, people were used to have the Word of God delivered to them by ways of sitting together and someone reading it to them.  Everybody expected that public reading of Scriptures to be practiced in the synagogue at that time.  This is exactly why Paul told Timothy to always, always continue with the public reading The preaching and the teaching.  The Word of God is changing people.  It's not pastors and it's not preachers and it's not professors.  It's the Word of God.  I intend to launch a weekly broadcast of public reading of scriptures using the drama Bible that has been such a great blessing to me. ",
