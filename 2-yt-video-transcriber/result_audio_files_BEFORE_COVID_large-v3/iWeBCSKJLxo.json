I don't want ever any white person to ever tell me or question me or my people about being loyal to the United States and the Constitution ever fucking again.  When you've got people here When you've got people here who put Donald Trump before the Constitution, it just came to my mind, every damn argument that I have on, and I want my colleagues to hear this, every freaking argument in almost every day, some fucking Trump supporter calls up here And when asked about the Constitution, when asked about the rule of law, when asked to support the institutions of this government, they put Trump over all of it and then have the audacity to question us.  why aren't we Americans?  Why do we have to be hyphen?  That's what y'all ought to be, Trump hyphen Americans.  It just dawned on me, especially the last two callers, you've got an enemy of the United States.  There's no ifs, ands, buts about it.  An enemy of the United States of America, a country that your forefathers inherited.  My ancestors, hell, they fought for the loyalists.  I mean, black folk were forced here.  Oh, y'all should be, this is what conservatives say, y'all should be happy.  we brought y'all here from Africa.  Y'all should be happy.  This is the greatest country on the planet.  And you got a president of the United States that says, screw the Constitution.  Oh, impeachment, that's a dirty word.  No, it's a word that the founders who wrote the Constitution deliberately put in so that we wouldn't have to deal with an asshole like you. ",
