So this bus has to stop in the moving lane of traffic because she can't get over to the bus stop out of the moving lane traffic.  Wow.  I want to show you one of the dangers of this parking situation here.  I'm going to hold this camera at about the same level as a car would be if you were sitting in it.  So you're pulling out here.  To the left, you have oncoming traffic.  This lane, as you can see, is blocked by these illegally parked vehicles.  You cannot see anything without sticking the nose of your vehicle out here.  The bus can't even stop at the bus stop because it's blocked by cars from the sheriff's department.  Hey, sir.  Trying to get your attention.  How you doing?  How you doing, sir?  How you doing, sir?  We're just with Harris County Sheriff.  We're just kind of just curious what the videotape is going on.  Nobody uses videotape anymore.  It's all digital now.  Oh, really?  Okay.  I'm sure it's just technical work, but... just wondering what the reason was.  gail said he's probably doing some type of research.  yeah but just we do have undercover officers who drive some of these vehicles some of the illegally parked vehicles?  no some of the legal park legally partners.  are you sure?  yeah okay yeah we've been parked here.  you're what for a while?  we've been parking there for a while but it's illegal.  Well, we're not going to debate that.  We just wanted to make sure that everything was okay.  Well, who would debate that?  The city.  The city of Houston.  Well, the city of Houston has it marked as no parking.  They can answer your questions.  But they have it marked as no parking.  There's no question about that.  It's the Sheriff's Department vehicles that are illegally parked.  I was just checking to see what the situation was out here.  What was your name?  I didn't get your name.  You raised it.  Some people were concerned about what was going on out here.  Okay.  I didn't get your name.  I didn't give it.  You didn't give it?  You're not going to give it?  No.  What's your name?  Well, if you're not going to give me your name, I'm not going to give you my name.  It's okay.  You're okay.  Continue the video.  We just wanted to make sure everything was okay.  Yeah, because we have a police speaker.  We have individuals that are undercover officers.  Well, I don't know one from the other.  It's an officer safety issue.  I understand what I'm saying.  I don't know one from the other.  If they're undercover, I don't know the deal.  Have a nice day.  All right.  Yes, sir.  Do you need help with anything?  Nope.  Nothing?  Nope.  Sure.  So no issues?  Pardon me.  Oh, pardon me.  You're on the street.  Well, on the street.  I mean, I have no jurisdiction there.  My jurisdiction ends at the property line.  Don't forget.  I saw it.  That's pretty bad.  Yeah, I saw it.  No, I mean, especially down by the bus stop.  I mean, they're parked so bad down there, the bus can't even get out of the main road.  Oh, this way too?  Did you go down this street?  Yeah, but... Oh my goodness.  You know, I can see, I can kind of see it down there, okay, but blocking where the bus needs to be, which means they stop in the moving lane of traffic.  Oh, right.  And when you're pulling out down there, you can't see down this way.  Right.  That's right.  I remember when they were doing construction here, we had one lane on each side.  Oh my goodness.  Well, whoever's parked down there in that zone is endangering the lives of the citizens out here on the street.  You know, you should get your ticket book and go down there and cut them some tickets.  I'm serious.  I'm not kidding.  You got a ticket book?  No.  We're going to check the bureau.  It would be a patrol car you call out.  Well, you got a radio, right?  A cell phone?  You work for the sheriff's department.  You're here to enforce the law.  There's a violation.  I'll go look at it.  What was your name?  O'Neal?  I appreciate that you have a sense of humor.  Wait.  You work for the Sheriff's Department?  You do or you do not?  I said, do you work for the Sheriff's Department?  Because I'm going to FOI that picture.  So I just want to make sure you don't accidentally destroy it or anything.  Destroy it?  Yeah.  Delete it or anything like that.  Cool.  I'll get your name and badge number so I know who to FOIA it to.  Are you undercover?  If you're undercover, tell me and I won't publish you.  Okay, I guess you're not.  I'm sorry. ",
