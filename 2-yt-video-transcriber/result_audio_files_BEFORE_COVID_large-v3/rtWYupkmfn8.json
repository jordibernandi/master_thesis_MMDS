            "text": "Hey, it's Aaron, and today we're going to talk a little bit about something that has really nothing at all to do with this channel and its priorities.  It doesn't have to do with revolution, it doesn't have to do with politics, it doesn't have to do with capitalism or socialism or really anything at all.  It has to do with my personal aesthetics.  Now, I'm not saying that isn't important to this channel, I'm sure that it absolutely is, but it doesn't really have anything to do with any of the topics that I've been touching on lately, but it does have to do with my hair.  Now, apparently, according to a lot of people out there, my hair is cultural appropriation and I'm basically no better than Justin Trudeau wearing blackface.  Now we're going to talk a little bit about cultural appropriation and about the history of dreadlocks, uh, and all of that sort of thing.  But first I just want to address, um, What is it exactly?  What culture am I appropriating here when I'm wearing dreadlocks?  Now, a lot of you out there would probably say, oh, well, you're appropriating black culture.  But am I?  It turns out that if you look into the history of dreadlocks, like I'm sure many of you actually already have, you would know that dreadlocks have been worn by every single culture all across human history at basically every period in time.  It turns out that dreadlocks just happen naturally to your hair if you don't brush them.  And I realize that because I'm talking about my hair so much, a lot of people are going to be focusing on what it looks like.  And yes, I realize it is a little bit ratty.  I've had them for 13 years or more, actually, almost 14 years.  And they tend to get that way after a little while.  So I am going to eventually have to get them professionally touched up.  I've never done that before, but it's something that I'm eventually going to have to do.  So, like I was saying, dreadlocks have been worn with every culture all across history at every period in time.  It was worn by people in Africa and India, obviously.  It was also worn by Native Americans and also the Germanic Celts, the Spartans, and the Vikings all wore dreadlocks.  And remember that the Spartans and a lot of other cultures that wore these dreadlocks existed before our modern conceptions of race were even established.  conceived.  They weren't even really in any sort of real form.  Of course, we did have different colored skin, but we didn't have races like we do today, the black race or the white race or anything like that.  It was just people.  People were people, and that's what they were.  Back during ancient Rome and Greece and stuff like that, You were either a Roman or you were a barbarian.  It didn't matter whether or not your skin was black, brown, or any other hue.  It just really wasn't an issue.  It was about the same difference as somebody having different colored hair or different colored eyes.  So to say that back then, the people, the Spartans that were wearing dreadlocks were culturally appropriating black culture would be wrong on several different levels, considering that it was a Spartan hairstyle and that black culture wasn't really a thing.  It didn't really exist at that period in time.  So moving ahead.  Now, when we're talking about cultural appropriation, what we're basically talking about is the an oppressed group having something of theirs, of their culture, taken and readopted by an oppressor group, right?  Now, obviously, this is something that people usually cite when they're talking about the dreadlocks as a hairstyle.  They say, well, black culture, which has existed for a very long time, wears dreadlocks.  They wear afros.  They wear cornrows.  They have different types of hairstyle.  That ends up putting them in a position where where when they wear those traditional hairstyles, they have a harder time getting jobs, they have a harder time running for office, and a lot of different things.  So the black hairstyle does have a certain amount of stigma attached to it.  It does have a certain amount of culture attached to it.  And when people see white people wearing those certain hairstyles, they associate it with black culture, obviously, because black people do wear these sorts of hairstyles.  And they assume that this, in and of itself, is cultural appropriation because white people are stealing that from the black culture and being able to wear it and have no problems like black people do.  And Yeah, to a certain point, that is absolutely true.  I definitely have seen a lot of discrimination because of my hair.  I've lost jobs because of it.  I haven't gotten callbacks because of it.  But in essence, and to also be fair, I have extremely curly hair.  And when I just leave it alone, well, this is what it does.  Like I said, I've had it for 13 years.  It grows this way.  So it's just kind of the way my hair naturally falls.  So I'm being discriminated against in my own employment just simply by having my own natural hairstyle, which is very strange as far as I'm concerned.  But it doesn't mean that I don't have a certain amount of privilege.  Obviously I do.  If you're a black person and you have this style of hair, you're going to have a hundred times more hard, a hundred times harder problems.  A hundred times harder problems?  I don't know how to English today.  You're going to have hundreds of times more problems than you do if you're a white person.  That's just plain and simple.  That's obvious.  And I'm not going to say that anybody is wrong when they say that sort of thing.  But what I am going to say is that the history of dreadlocks comes from a multitude of different cultures.  In fact, every other culture... on the face of the earth has basically worn dreadlocks.  And I feel as though all of this hubbub, this hoopla, this stuff that's been going on about the whole dreadlocks thing really came about in and about 2016 when there was a viral video that was released where two college students were having an argument in a hallway about if dreadlocks were cultural appropriation.  And that's really where this whole idea came into fruition.  That's really where all of this came from.  And I think that all of it was really kind of just based off of a lack of understanding of the history of that thing in the first place.  like I said, the history of dreadlocks comes from every single culture all across human society.  So to say that one specific culture gets to have ownership of this hairstyle, um, is just not to understand what the hairstyle actually really is.  So yes, it comes from many different cultures.  Yes.  Black people have used them in the past.  Yes.  People that are of my cultural heritage, uh, Celtic, uh, from Germanic descent from, uh, Nordic descent and that sort of thing we all were dreadlocks as well.  lots of different cultures were dreadlocks.  So I just want to let you all know it isn't really a cultural appropriation But you know what.  that being said I have been wrong in the past.  So if you do think it's cultural appropriation, and you can give me a sound argument as to why?  Please leave it in the comment section down below and let's have a discussion about this.  so I'm not going to cut them off unless somebody is able to 100% tie it to being exactly like blackface.  I don't think that we're going to be able to do that considering my culture.  Like I said, Germanic Celts, Vikings, and that sort of thing wore this hairstyle for thousands of years.  So let's have a conversation about it.  Anyway, my name is Aaron.  Do check out my Patreon.  Every dollar does help fund this show.  And thank you very much for watching. ",
