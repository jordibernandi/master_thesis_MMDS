And Bill, there's a big story and I wanna get the attribution right here because I know people are gonna rush off and read the Atlantic under the headline of the future of the city is childless.  And it starts off by talking about the fact that the number of babies born in New York City's five boroughs has dropped by 9% and Manhattan by 15% since 2011.  At this rate, Manhattan's infant population will be cut in half in 30 years.  Same thing happening in cities across the country.  By the way, the lowest percentage of children in any of the major 100 American cities is, no surprise, San Francisco.  But Seattle, Washington,  D.C.,  even though Washington,  D.C.'s  population has grown by 20% in recent times, the number of children has actually declined.  Bill, it seems to me that if you turn over the cities to nothing but essentially young, white, college-educated, childless, affluent workaholics, that's going to have a fundamental effect on what has been the Democrat Party's stronghold, will it not?

And if they're trying to say that kids are going to be born out on the farm and migrate to New York, well, that kind of thing has always happened, and it'll continue to happen.  But the idea that a country can move into a world with declining birth rates would work so long as it didn't decline too precipitously and so long as they stabilized at a level, and most importantly, most importantly, most importantly, if everybody in the world were doing so.  But that's certainly not the case. ",

I have some pretty solid guesses as to some of the components of it.  Certainly, the increase of affluence and wealth means that we don't need to have as many children because, frankly, everybody thinks about children as supporting us in our old age.  I mean, I come from coal miners and mill workers in Lancashire, and they had 10, 11 people in the family, not just to take care of mom and dad when mom and dad were old, but because there was just simply so much work to be done that this was your own unpaid workforce.  and you could count on them.  So needless to say that the kind of the economic drive for larger families is largely gone.  and certainly I'm not saying that I'd like to return to the either the squalor or the the overwhelming burden of having a family of 11 kids or whatever to take care of and feed.  But I am saying that something seems to be going terribly wrong and that the entire life force of Western civilization is rapidly declining.  I suspect there are environmental things involved.  I've heard anecdotally But I've heard enough to really believe it that testosterone levels in Western civilizations are just plummeting. ",

Is a future with fewer kids, more free time, more ability to live a life, your own life, and accomplish things you want to accomplish and still raise two or three kids, but as opposed to having, as in the case of my ancestors and yours as well, I'm sure, where basically the entire function of mom and dad is to provide for the family.  They don't get to be artists or painters or writers.  No, they don't work in coal mines to feed the kids.  Certainly there's a balance in there, but I do worry that if losing children as the primary source of joy and fulfillment in your life is the future, then I don't think there is a future. ",

Meanwhile, as all these sort of young childless people move into the cities, 25 metro areas now account for half of the U.S.  economy.  And again, I'd like to get back to that question of the impact on this.  Obviously, the Democratic Party will benefit by having, you know, these wealthy nuclei of people who tend to lean in that progressive direction.  On the other hand, they need the bodies, too.  They need the numbers, and this would bode ill for them. ",

            "text": "Well, this is exactly what we're seeing.  The Democrats, I'm speaking in generalities, obviously, but the progressives are basically saying life is much easier without kids.  So we get to do the things that we want to rather than sacrificing for kids.  So we're going to do the things that we want to.  And this makes our lives much better.  Unfortunately, if we do this, those damn conservatives are going to outbreed us, which means they're going to outvote us.  So in order for us to maintain this self-centered lifestyle, we're going to have to bring in people from outside of the country to do the job that Americans won't do, which is to vote for progressive policies.  The problem there is that when you are indiscriminate about this, and I know all about the progressives and their dog whistles and all the rest of this nonsense.  When I say when you're indiscriminate about immigration, I'm not talking about where you come from or what you look like or your skin color, even your religion for that matter.  When I say you're indiscriminate about who you allow to emigrate into America, I'm.  What I mean by that is you are philosophically indiscriminate.  You are counting all bodies as equal, and you are not taking into effect the one thing that had always been in place in the story of American immigration and assimilation, and that is the burning desire to be an American, not to live in America.  These are two very distinct, important differences.  that just this second flew into my head.  There is a difference between wanting to be an American and wanting to live in America.  God, I cannot believe it took me 10 years to get this really as clear as it is.  This country, prior to the 60s or so, had been populated by peoples, entire peoples, nations, where suddenly it dawned on them, that the most adventurous of them anyway, and the hardest working ones and the bravest ones said, you know, I want to be an American because if I go to America and work hard, I can have some control over my life and not have to live this kind of drudgery and toil and endless backbreaking labor for the Duke or the Baron or the Earl or whatever the case may be.  But that desire to become an American as an immigrant brought with it a concomitant understanding that this was going to require work and discipline and self-discipline, delayed gratification, all of these things.  That's what made this country what it is.  If you take the process of becoming an American out of the equation, in other words, I want to go live in a country where my hard work will make my life better and therefore the entire society gets better.  If you take that out, and you just leave, I want to live in America, then what you've got is somebody who wants to bring all of the habits that have made where they're coming from an unpleasant place to be.  They want to bring those same habits to America, enjoy the benefits that have been provided by people who have a different work ethic than they do, And then simply watch the country become more and more overloaded with people who have come to live here but haven't come here to be Americans.  And this is what the immigration thing is all about.  And this is why this birth rate thing is so destructive.  If we could somehow look into people's souls... and see what their intention was to come here.  And if we, let's just say for the sake of the philosophical argument, we had one of those x-ray screeners or something like at the airport, and somebody stepped in that, and this machine would scan around, and the machine would determine whether or not they want to come here to work, make their lives better, live the American dream, or whether they basically just wanted to come here to, you know, enjoy all the benefits and maybe make some of the money, send some at home.  If we could have that scanner, I'd be willing to let in just about anybody who basically came out of that with a green light.  So declining birth rates are, they're not just important and they're not just kind of important.  They're everything.  We are seeing two really interesting examples right now in front of our eyes.  One of them is Sweden.  and the other one is Japan.  Both of them have very, very, very low birth rates, far lower than even the American domestic birth rate is.  In Sweden As the birth rates declined, there's a history, Scandinavia in general, but there's a history, Europe in general, but there's a history of having watched Sweden import people to do the jobs and to keep the socialism pyramid in place because you have to have a pyramid.  Socialism is a Ponzi scheme.  Four people can work hard enough to support one person for their life, but one person can't support four.  It's just not possible.  So, Sweden's answer has been to import Swedes, but the Swedes that they're importing don't want to be Swedes.  They want to live in Sweden.  And so we're watching Sweden become a place where blonde people, blue-eyed people cannot walk through certain neighborhoods in Malmo, for example, without somebody getting on a cell phone and having a flash mob appear and making it crystal clear to them that they're not welcome here in their own country.

It's not just that there are fewer people living in cities or there's a net negative migration out of these major cities, but the effect of reshuffling the deck is putting large concentrations of young liberals in places that don't really benefit the Democrats.  For example, and this comes into play when you talk about gerrymandered congressional districts as well as the electoral college.  Hillary Clinton won Brooklyn by 461,000 votes, about seven times the margin by which she lost Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
