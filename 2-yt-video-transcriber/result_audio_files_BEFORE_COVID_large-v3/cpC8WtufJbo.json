            "text": "So, you're trying to convince someone that God exists.  You're probably overwhelmed with the amount of information and approaches other theists recommend.  You need a starting point.  As an atheist myself, I've become pretty familiar with the popular arguments for God's existence, both because my theist viewers send them to me literally every day in comments and emails, all that, thanks guys, and because it's important to me to seek truth in studying arguments contrary to my position.  That's why I've decided to create a guide that will illustrate and rank the power of each of the more popular arguments for God's existence.  Although I've found all arguments for God I've encountered so far to be logically or evidentially problematic in some way, I do see some arguments as better than others.  Here I'll rank popular arguments by their stats in four areas.  One, intuitiveness, the ease at which the mind comprehends or even instinctively believes the concepts at play.  Two, fallacy aversion, the extent to which an argument avoids utilizing logical fallacies and or hides them well within its premises.  Three, communicability, the ease at which the argument is communicated to others and or its ability to capture attention when communicated.  Finally, four, refutation resistance, the extent to which an argument presents a challenge to refute, whether by means of complexity. ",
