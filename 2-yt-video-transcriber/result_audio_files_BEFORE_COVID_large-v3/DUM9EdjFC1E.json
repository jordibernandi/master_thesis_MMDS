Is that the second... is that Clubber?  Rocky 3 is Clubber Lang, yes.  This is our Clubber Lang!  I feel like Ray Comfort was Apollo Creed, so he's 1 and 2.  Right?  Okay, sure.  Who was our... so this is our Clubber!  Okay.  Christiano Bros, you were not part of it.  Anyway, we have something very exciting on YouTube.  on August 6th, a Tuesday at 7 p.m.  Eastern Time.  We will be engaging in a battle of wits.  He's like one of the original monoliths of early YouTube apologetics, creationism, ex-convicts.  Dr.  Dino himself.  Kent Hovind.  How do you feel?  I feel like I'm going to be frustrated more than anything.  I don't know.  We'll see how it goes.  I'm pretty excited.  So that's going to be taking place on Modern Day Debates.  We will be streaming it as well.  It will be a very good time.  This has been the least smooth announcement ever.  Announcement!  Graphics!  PAPOW!  Show up for the debate, or don't, but it'll be good.  So.  See you guys later.  Mac.  Karate Kid.  There'll be physical challenges.  There'll be an obstacle course.  Riddles.  Pie eating contest?  I don't like pie.  Me either, really.  We'll probably lose that one.  Geography quiz?  We'll win that one.  Anyway, see you there. ",
