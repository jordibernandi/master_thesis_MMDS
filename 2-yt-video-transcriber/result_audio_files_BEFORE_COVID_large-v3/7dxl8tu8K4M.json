            "text": "All esteem to the Most High Elohim.  This is your brother Al.  I want to say Shabbat Shalom to the family out there.  I'm broadcasting to you directly from Jamestown, Virginia.  We have now come out here to connect with the family to do some work of the Most High and If you haven't seen that video that I put up a little bit earlier, check that out where we went right to the shores in Jamestown, Virginia, the same place that Most High Will.  we're going to be doing the baptisms at tomorrow.  And we spoke about the history of our people arriving at those very same shores 400 years ago.  before i put that video up myself and some of the brothers and sisters we were out there on the shores of those waters and we were praying curses back on the heathens.  we were repenting for the sins of our people repenting for our individual sins and just praying that the most high remembers his people and that he remembers the covenant that he made with abraham isaac and jacob.  we cried out to the father just like our people did in egypt And eventually the father heard us.  So we pray in these times as all of us humble ourself and repent towards our father that he will hear us again.  And as we left the beach and started fellowshipping, I began to think about how the most high is an empire destroyer.  The father destroys empires, wicked empires.  I think all throughout history, all the empires that everybody said would reign forever, that everybody said was the most powerful, that they ended up falling.  Rome, Babylon, Egypt.  Persia, Greece, Assyria, the Ottoman Empire.  The list goes on and on about all these empires that were destroyed by the power of the Most High.  And as I left that site, where our ancestors pulled up 400 years ago, I began to get comfort and encouragement that this wicked empire will also be destroyed, because history only repeats itself.  So I'm feeling very encouraged right now.  My faith has boosted, my confidence in the Father has boosted, and my spirit is charged.  I feel like really putting in work for the Most High at an even higher level and upping the operation that we have going on.  And tomorrow we're going to be going to Hampton, Virginia.  Because in my research, I also found out that many of our ancestors were shipped to Hampton, Virginia as well as Jamestown.  So I want to go to that land as well, just like we did in Jamestown today and stand on that land where that innocent blood was shed.  Because the scripture says that the father still hears the cries of innocent blood.  So I want to stand in those places where our people pulled up at and cry out to the father.  And I pray that the Ruach HaKadosh, the Holy Spirit, would move upon you to also cry out to the Most High on behalf of your people and on behalf of yourself.  And I pray that he will hear us once again.  So I'm looking forward to going to Hampton tomorrow and also to Newport News, Virginia, because there's a lot of our people over there in Newport News.  They call it Bad News, Virginia.  But I'm going to pull up also on Newport News and Hampton, and we're going to connect with some of our family.  We're going to hit up some of the homeless shelters over there.  So I'm really looking forward to hitting up Newport News and Hampton tomorrow, Virginia.  After we do the baptisms for our brothers and sisters here in Jamestown, I'm excited about what the father is doing and I'm ready for what he has for our people in the future.  I'm not going to hold you long today.  I just want to come in here and go over some scriptures as we've been having scripture discussions every day.  And most I will, we will continue all the way through the whole entire calendar year of 2019.  I wanted to come in here today and talk about how the most high is an empire destroyer.  Let's go to Daniel chapter two, verses 31 through 44.  Listen to what Daniel explains to the wicked Babylonian king about all these empires that will be destroyed.  Listen to this.  thou o king sawest and behold a great image.  this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible.  this image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay.  Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and clay, and break them to pieces.  Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors.  And the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them.  And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.  This is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.  Thou, O king, art a king of kings, for the Elohim of heaven have given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.  And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beast of the field and the fowls of the heaven have he given into thine hand, and have made thee ruler over them  all.\".  Thou art this head of gold, and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth.  And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things, and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise.  And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided.  But there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.  And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken.  And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.  So the prophet Daniel is explaining to this wicked Babylonian king all the phases, periods, and stages of all the world empires that shall rule and that shall be destroyed.  Listen to this.  The last sentence is powerful.  It says, and in the days of these kings shall the most high of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever.  hallelujah.  so family the most high is an empire destroyer.  all these empires that rise that everybody thinks will rule for millennia.  the father crushes them and that's what the messiah is talking about in matthew chapter 21 in verse 42 where it says the messiah saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builder rejected?  the same has become the head of the corner.  This is the most highest doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.  Listen to verse 44.  And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.  What the Messiah is saying there is the exact same thing that's written in Daniel chapter two, verse 31 through 44 about the kingdom of the most high and the most high himself being an empire destroyer.  Hallelujah.  This is what the scripture is talking about in Revelation, because guess what?  Let's go to Revelation.  Because what we're going to read here is that not only is the Most High an empire destroyer, but his son is an empire destroyer as well.  And not only is his son an empire destroyer, but the son has also given us power to be empire destroyers.  Hallelujah.  Listen to this.  Let's go to Revelation chapter two, verse 25.  It says, but that which he have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end.  to him will I give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter.  shall they be broken to shivers.  What the Messiah is saying there is that as he is an empire destroyer, he's gonna give his people, which is us, the chosen, the power to be empire destroyers, destroyers of the American empire, destroyers of the Greek empire, destroyers of the Roman empire, destroyers of the Babylonian empire, Our father is an empire destroyer.  The son is an empire destroyer.  And we are empire destroyers.  For the Messiah tells us that we are his battle axe and weapon of war.  Hallelujah.  These are verses to build your confidence and build your faith.  Let's go to Jeremiah chapter four, verse five through seven.  The most high is an empire destroyer.  It says, declare ye in Judah and publish in Jerusalem and say, blow ye the trumpet in the land.  Cry, gather together and say, assemble yourselves and let us go into the defense cities.  Set up the standard toward Zion.  Retire, stay not, for I will bring evil from the north and a great destruction.  The lion has come up from his thicket, listen, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way.  He has gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an inhabitant.  The scripture calls the most high, the destroyer of the Gentiles.  I love this verse.  Once again, I got to read this.  It says the lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way.  He has gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an inhabitant.  Hallelujah.  The Most High is an empire destroyer.  The sun is an empire destroyer.  We, the people of the Most High, are empire destroyers.  Let's go to Enoch chapter 62, verse 1 through 13.  Like I said, I won't hold you.  Here's what it says.  And thus the most high commanded the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who dwell upon the earth and said, open your eyes and raise your horns.  If you are able to acknowledge the chosen one and the sovereign, the most high set on his throne of glory and the spirit of righteousness was poured out on him.  and the word of his mouth kills all the sinners and all the lawless and they are destroyed in front of him.  This is talking about the judgment upon all nations.  Verse three.  And on that day, all the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who possess the earth will stand up and they will see and recognize how he sits on the throne of his glory.  And the righteous are judged in righteousness in front of him.  And no idle word is spoken in front of him.  And pain will come upon them as upon a woman in labor, for whom giving birth is difficult when her child enters the mouth of the womb and she has difficulty giving birth.  And one half of them will look at the other, and they will be terrified and will cast down their faces.  And pain will take hold of them when they see that son of a woman sitting on the throne of his glory.  And the mighty kings and all those who possess the earth will praise and bless and exalt him who rules everything that is hidden.  For from the beginning that Son of Man was hidden, and the Most High kept Him in the presence of His power and revealed Him only to the chosen.  And the community of the holy and the chosen will be sown, and all the chosen will stand before Him on that day.  And all the mighty kings and the exalted and those who rule the dry ground will fall down before Him on their faces and worship, and they will set their hopes on that Son of Man and will entreat Him and will petition for mercy from Him.  so the messiah the most high the empire destroyers all these mighty kings the alexander the great the julius caesar the gangas khan all those men that history worships as being mighty conquerors will be falling down on their knees and face before the messiah before the bronze-skinned, woolly-haired, dark-skinned Messiah from Nazareth, they will fall on their face and worship.  It says, And all the mighty kings and the exalted and those who rule the dry ground will fall down before him on their faces and worship, and they will set their hopes on that Son of Man and will entreat him and will petition him for mercy.  So they will fall on their face before the Messiah, begging for their life.  Verse 10, but the sovereign of spirits will then so press them that they will hasten to go out from before him and their faces will be filled with shame.  and the darkness will grow deeper on their faces and the angels of punishment will take them so that they may repay them for the wrong they did to his children and to his chosen ones.  So you see, family, that's why we're here in Jamestown crying out to the Most High.  Because here in Enoch, chapter 62, verse 11, the scripture says that the Most High hears the cries of his people and he will repay the heathen for what they have done to his chosen.  Listen to this, Enoch chapter 62 verse 11.  And the angels of punishment will take them so that they may repay them for the wrong that they did to his children and to his chosen ones.  And they will become a spectacle to the righteous and to his chosen ones.  They will rejoice over them for the anger of the most high of spirits will rest upon them and the sword of the most high will be drunk with them and the righteous and the chosen will be saved on that day and they will never see the faces of sinners again.  and the lawless from then on.  All praise to the most high, the holy one of Israel, the king of the universe, because he is an empire destroyer.  I pray that y'all are edified by that.  I know it's getting kind of late for the brothers and sisters.  that's on the east coast, but once again, we here in Jamestown, VA, I'm thinking the most high that we made it safely.  I'm looking forward to the fellowship.  My spirit is charged up.  I'm ready for the fellowship tomorrow.  I'm ready for Hampton.  I'm ready to also shoot over there to Newport News, Virginia.  Before I go, brothers and sisters, check out the link in the description box because we have some amazing projects from the ministry.  We have the 613 Laws of Torah audiobook, which is a five-hour audiobook containing all the laws and commands of Torah.  It's narrated by myself.  Only the laws and commands, no other commentary.  The scripture tells us that we must meditate on the laws and commands every day.  And we live in a time where people are constantly on the go.  So we put together the audio book of the laws and commands so you can download it.  You can listen to it on your iPhone, your iPad, your any type of cell phone device you have, your desktop.  You can listen to it while you're in your car.  You can listen to the laws and commands while you're at work, while you're working out in the gym, while you're going to sleep at night.  I'm going to put the link in the description box underneath this video, how you can download that project and invest in it.  We also have the words of the Messiah audio book, which is a four hour audio book also narrated by myself.  The Messiah is the Torah in the flesh.  So we put together that audio book so you can meditate on all his parables, his wise sayings and his words.  That's also narrated by myself.  In order for us to worship the most high in spirit and in truth, we have to look at the example of the Messiah.  And the way to be more like him is to meditate on his words and then practice what he says.  Hallelujah.  So I'll also put the link in the description box for the words of the Messiah audio book.  We also have the words of the father audio book, which is a 14 hour long audio book also narrated by myself.  It contains all the words recorded in scripture that the most high, the father spoke himself all the way from Genesis, where he said, let there be light all the way to revelation, where he said, or all the way to the New Testament where he said, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.  The scripture says that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the father.  So we put together that audio book so that you can meditate on all the words that the father said, because guess what?  Without the father, we wouldn't have the Torah or the Messiah.  So by meditating on the words of the father, you draw strength and amazing strength indeed.  I will also put the link in the description box underneath this video on how you can invest in that project and download that project.  Also, we have the Hebrews for Excellence in Exodus campaign, which is exactly what we're doing right now, family.  With Hebrews for Excellence in Exodus, we are traveling all over the United States from city to city, all over the world as well because the scripture says that this truth must be spread to all four corners of the earth because all of our people the chosen ones were spread to all four corners of the earth.  so with the hebrews for excellence in exodus campaign we are traveling from city to city and whenever we go to these cities we will be baptizing preaching and teaching hitting the homeless shelters hitting the hospitals hitting the prisons hitting the jails.  We will be going to the nursing homes to minister to our people and be servants of our people.  A couple of weeks ago, we went to San Diego and did some business of the most high out there, some baptisms and some fellowship.  Now, today, this weekend, we are in Jamestown, Virginia, doing the work of the most high baptizing.  We'll also be going to Virginia to hit up some homeless shelters over there by Newport News.  So I thank all you brothers and sisters who have been supporting the Hebrews for Excellence in Exodus campaign.  Because of your support, we're able to do things like this to go reach our people wherever we are at.  Hallelujah.  So for those that's interested in supporting and joining us on our travels, shoot me an email, victoriesuccessdestiny at gmail.com.  I'll put my email in the description box.  Reach out to me.  Hallelujah.  Just give me a couple of days to get back to you because I got a lot going on.  I'm on the road and I'm handling a lot of kingdom business.  So please be patient in giving me time to respond to you all.  Praise.  For those who also want to support through monetary donations, I'll also put a link in the description box how you can support through donations and support the Hebrews for Excellence in Exodus campaign.  But I can tell you, as long as the Most High gives us grace and mercy, we will be coming to a city near you in the very near future so that we can do the work of the Most High and spread this truth to all four corners of the earth.  So family, continue to stay in prayer, stay repented up, keep crying out to the Most High, keep manifesting Hebrew excellence, and let's endure to the end with victory, success, and destiny.  It's time for us to be some empire destroyers.  Shabbat Shalom. ",
