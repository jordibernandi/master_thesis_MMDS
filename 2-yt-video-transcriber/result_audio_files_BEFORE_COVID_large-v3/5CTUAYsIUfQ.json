            "text": "Several viewers, such as recently Malu Rulan, have sent in information about this most beautiful tree on Earth known as the Rainbow Eucalyptus.  Ever seen it before?  This very large, colorful tree originates in the Philippines of all places.  Our viewers have questioned, Is it a coincidence that the rainbow, you know, Yahuwah's sign for the covenant with all the earth, may also be preserved as a symbol in this tree from the very land where Noah built the ark, which is its place of origin?  Interesting.  No, we did not, nor have we ever said the Ark landed in the Philippines.  But that it was constructed there, as we prove in our Solomon's Gold series, it is the land of Adam and Eve called Havila, which is actually named after Eve.  Hava is her name.  hebrew name and it means one who suffers pain that brings forth which means childbirth.  it is the land of childbirth the land of the very first childbirth.  Now we know this because we test the three resources that define this land of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2 from thousands of years ago.  And the Philippines still today is number one in all three resources on all of earth.  So really there is nothing left to guesswork here.  Now if you have not seen that series, you are in for the journey of a lifetime.  We will link it at the end of this video in English and Tagalog for you to start.  This series is not actually new information, but restores ancient truths, which were known all the way up until the 1890s.  Even Jose Rizal, which we cover, was aware. ",
