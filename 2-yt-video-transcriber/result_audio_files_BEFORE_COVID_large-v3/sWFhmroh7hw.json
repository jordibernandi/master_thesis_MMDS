            "text": "Are we on?  Okay.  Okay, are we live?  Okay, okay.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm Mr.  Green with AMTV.  And this... Maybe one of the most important videos that you will ever have seen in your life.  People are making mention that they're not getting their notifications.  Be sure to like, subscribe, and hit that bell.  Ding!  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the information that I'm going to share with you is... Pretty serious.  And there's gonna be a link down below.  But here at Con Merchant Ministries, I being the number one pastor, I'm gonna tell you right now some factual information that you are gonna find hard to believe on this Sunday afternoon.  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm so infuriated.  Sorry.  I went to the Smollett Acting Academy.  As you can tell.  I seem so upset, but I'm really not, but kind of, sort of, not really.  If you follow my business model, If you actually follow my business model, you will see.  You will have the results like I have had in the last 48 hours.  Are you aware?  Are you aware that the viewership on my YouTube page has dropped 78%?  Are you aware of that?  I've received telephone calls.  I've received emails from absolute and utter nobodies on the interwebs.  And somehow, someway, I don't know how it's being done exactly, we're assembling a team of AMTV investigators to find out what is going on here.  Because as a con merchant at the Con Merchant Ministries, it is imperative that you click on these links down below so I can raise my AdSense status, so I can raise my Alexa global ranking.  What is wrong with you people?  When you see some sort of... 78% in two days!  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, do you remember back in 2016 when I set up the GoFundMe for $100,000?  Do you remember that?  Do you remember?  When I told you I needed a new computer, and I needed a new studio, and I needed a hard editor, and from that $100,000, it was actually raised, I think it was $27,000, something like that.  Remember that?  Do you remember 2017 when I tried to raise $150,000?  But I only raised 17.  Do you remember that?  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, because I own AdSense Rich.  I sure do.  And that's how I'm doing it.  With my con merchant wares.  I pump up my chest, and because I went to the Smollett Acting Academy, and I gotta cry every now and then and interject all these little things that really mean absolutely nothing, And between the collapse, the EMP is coming.  And between all of these cataclysms and catastrophic events where you can go and you can download my PDF.  It means absolutely squat.  Why are my views down on my videos in the past?  48 hours, 78 Did you hear me?  78%!  Wow!  And here's another thing, monograph.  Please, please stop saying that I drive the Pinto of Ferraris.  Stop that.  It's hurting my feelings.  Just, okay.  This has been Mr.  Green with AMTV.  Until next time.  Like, subscribe and share.  Don't forget to hit the bell. ",
