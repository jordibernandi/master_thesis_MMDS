Boats going over the horizon.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't leave.  Not just any boats.  because I know that you lot don't understand that this kind of video isn't proof of what you think it is.  You aren't seeing boats come up from over the horizon, but just being resolved in greater detail, as before it was just too tiny to see.  My first easily repeatable test will involve instead of using tiny boats that can barely be seen even when zoomed in, Go to a shipping port with those big buggers.  You'll be able to resolve them at a much greater distance and when they finally do slip out of sight and you crack out your camera, no matter how much you zoom in, you'll never be able to make it suddenly appear in full as you can see with these three ships here.  No matter the level of zoom, they all maintain their position in relation to the horizon.  Especially of note is this one that is clearly behind it.  And no, just because this is a still doesn't change anything about how zooming works.  But I can't wait for one of you to argue that and prove you don't know how yet another thing works.  Oh, wait, you wanted two, didn't you?  Uh, climb a tree.  Seriously, just climb a tree in a relatively flat area.  You'll see further.  Who am I kidding?

Speaking of laughing, I like your little meme there, and it is actually fairly accurate, but only because the confusion and shock that anyone would be so silly as to print a newspaper saying, they proved the Earth is flat, without a huge asterisk explaining, well, they didn't, but we just wanted you to buy this, because paper media is becoming so irrelevant.
