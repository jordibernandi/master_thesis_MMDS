            "text": "Greetings, this is Indian in the Machine.  I wanted to give you a heads up on the 5G technology.  You must know that it is microwave technology.  And you must comprehend that the human body is an antenna.  You also must know that these signals can affect our health.  Now, surely you know the experiment of putting metal into a microwave oven.  Well, What do you think will happen to the metal within the human body when it is subjected to microwave energy from the 5G towers?  Now, moving forward, comprehend that if you are acidic, that you have more heavy metals in your body.  So now we can make a very reasonable assumption that if you are acidic, that the 5G microwave energies will affect you in a more dramatic way.  There is a push for 5G.  Because it is the network that they envision for the self-driving cars, the drones hooked up to the network.  all sorts of automated technologies.  And yeah, there can be benefits.  However, humanity in its wisdom must not sacrifice its own health in order to move forward technologically.  that would be really going actually backwards and not forwards.  When we move forwards, then we utilize technology that raises the frequencies of humanity and other life forms.  This is what humanity is designed to do with technology in its balanced form.  So know that this technology will... It's anti-life.  It's like living in a microwave oven 24-7.  And furthermore, even if you personally get out of the microwave energies and go to the countryside, which might be a really fantastic idea, then know that when you go to the cities and the grocery stores are bathing the energies even already in all sorts of networks.  And I've seen a YouTube video that shows really high radiation in public places.  Well, what if you buy food and already are buying food from your grocery store that is already bombarded with radiation 24 7. okay so the implications here are massive.  we can imagine this isn't?  this isn't a great development for our dna that we just can't like zap any sort of frequency that anyone wants to zap around?  you know, the space around us with just like all sorts of random energies.  And it's not having an effect on our DNA?  Well, it most certainly is.  So this is why I encourage people to alkalize.  This will reduce the amount of heavy metals in your body and will make you less susceptible to frequencies that are all around us even now.  I mean, it's already happening.  Even 5G is just going to make it much more obvious.  but it's already having an effect.  Acidic people are probably doing much worse under the existing conditions of electromagnetic radiation and any radiation that is not the healthy radiation.  And there is healthy radiation.  The sun radiates, for example, and I even remember learning from an archangel at Metatron channeling via James Tiburon.  that radium, the element, is radioactive, let's say radioactively notable, and is healthy for the body.  Also with 5G, what do you think it's going to do to people's brains when they are slowly frying in a microwave 24-7?  OK.  There are so many implications here.  What do you think it's going to do to property values?  Who's going to want to buy a house that's being bombarded with 5G?  And whatever happens to the human body is much more important than the issue of property values, which are likely to normalize, I feel, in the future so that everybody can afford reasonable housing.  And to be sure, You can probably kiss your property values goodbye, because nobody is going to want to live in a house that is bombarded with microwaves.  Oh, some may choose it, and it may seem everything is normal, but you just wait until the ramifications set in.  Some may pay a heavy, heavy price to embrace life under the microwaves.  And they may feel the most safe there, the most taken care of.  And others will likely flee to the countryside.  Those who choose life and ascension, the raising of their frequencies rather than the lowering of their frequencies.  Let it be known that if you are existing in the frequencies of love, then this is more powerful than the harmful radiation.  However, just as you wouldn't stick your head in a microwave and say, love, love, love, I'm love, I'm love, this isn't going to affect me, this isn't going to affect me, there might be a chance that it does affect you.  have some moments of realness on this issue and presence and you won't be caught off guard and you won't be led astray and you will know what to do and you will be inspired and excited about life.  there's always an x level and often That next level is unexpected and unknown to ourselves.  We learn trust through this process.  Trust that we are guided.  Trust in our purpose for being here on the planet.  Trust in our higher selves.  Trust in our merging of soul with our creator.  Because through this process, our presence of soul light will light the way.  And it's actually in this process, you're lighting the way to the good times.  You're not just lighting the way to, you know, the next disaster.  You're actually lighting the way to paradise on earth.  So thanks for listening and thanks for being that beacon of light.  Anytime you choose the light, that is the role that you play.  And there is much more in this great adventure called life.  I wish you many blessings on your many adventures.  The unexpected ones.  The ones you can't even conceive of right now.  The ones where you have no idea what the next steps will be. ",
