            "text": "Hey guys.  I've talked about this a few times on my channel before and had some conversations with viewers and other YouTubers about it, but I really wanted to have a more focused discussion today on something that I think may be afflicting many of us.  Burnout and what to do when righteous anger dissipates and turns into apathy.  I think this might be why male content creators are generally better than women.  They don't internalize the criticism or engage in the fear of repercussion as much, particularly as it pertains to media backlash.  They just keep getting angry at the injustice and that fuels them.  As such, the men have more mental energy available to funnel into this creative process.  I, on the other hand, make a video when I feel truly compelled and inspired to, which, as you can tell, is infrequently.  And I can tell that other content creators like Stefan, Styx, Matt Christensen are motivated and feel compelled to do their very important jobs when they experience righteous anger at the current state of affairs.  I used to be more like this as well back in the day when I was more hopeful that we would be able to turn this ship around.  Since it has become clear to me over the last year or so that we're probably in too deep and we're going to have to start anew, I've begun to really internalize these waves of hopelessness, although it comes and goes.  worsening censorship, unveiling new levels of government corruption, and unwillingness of the general public to accept their circumstances, I want people to be hopeful, so I probably shouldn't be infecting people with my unending negativity.  So when I see something that makes me hopeful that things are changing, that does help me make a video.  Ostensibly, we're in pretty good times now.  Longer lifespan, less violence, technological advances that would look like sorcery to our ancestors.  I shouldn't really be feeling this way now.  People were probably more emotionally hardy during the plagues or the depression.  Yet here we are.  So I've been wondering why.  Why now in these better times is there this all-encompassing anxiety, this existential angst, this nagging feeling of impending doom that is robbing me of my productivity?  I've talked about this before as well, but culturally, part of it has to be our lack of spirituality and conviction.  Even in hellish times on Earth, our Christian ancestors, galloping into battle, knowing full well that they were going to be hacked to death, had a strong sense of purpose and duty, which our iPhone-scrolling modern society just lacks.  We've replaced God with a dogmatic devotion to atheism.  We have upended natural gender roles by mandating that all Westerners deny even the existence of biological gender, which of course is based on dubious, politically motivated pseudoscience.  We flushed the myriad teachings of superior men down the toilet because-. ",
