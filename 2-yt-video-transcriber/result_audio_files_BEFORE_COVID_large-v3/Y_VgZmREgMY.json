            "text": "Let's check out the brand new Springfield Armory XDM Elite OSP.  What's going on?  Luke from USA Carry here.  If you're new to the channel, I do guns and gear reviews, defensive gun use breakdowns, and concealed carry tips, and I've got some other content planned this year.  Today, we're doing two reviews.  I'm gonna split that up into two different videos, so I'll probably link the other one up here and at the end of the video.  So today, Springfield Armory has released a new line of pistols, the XDM Elite series.  I've got two of them here, so I'm gonna start off with the XDM Elite Tactical OSP.  They come in... A little range bag, which is kinda nice.  A lot of the Springfield guns come in a hard case, but I kinda like this little range bag.  It's got some pockets for mags, but anyway, I got some fun stuff in here.  This is their Elite Tactical.  OSP, so that's optics ready, and this is their Desert FDE.  I put a Vortex Venom on top and an Olight PL Pro Valkyrie.  So my first impressions of this gun is it's huge, kind of in a good way, but the weight feels pretty good.  They've got some wide slide serrations, which remind me of the Beretta Apex Compact that came out that has some big slide serrations here, which I kind of like.  You got a threaded barrel, suppressor high sights, and then it's got a slide cut to put red dots on it.  So it comes with three mounting plates for a few different red dots.  So I've got two in here and obviously one here for the Vortex Venom.  They come from mounting plates for the Vortex Venom, the Buris Fast Fire 2 and 3, the Leupold Delta Point and the Delta Point Pro, the J-Point and the Trijicon RMR.  A lot of grip textures lately have been that micro dots, but this is a little bit different.  There's two different magwells.  So they're both flared magwells.  This one is their standard and this is what they're calling their short magwell.  They're saying this holds 20, but it shows 19 on both of them.  But with this, it's supposed to hold 22 plus one in the gun.  This one holds 20 plus one in the gun.  So we'll test that here when we load them up.  Obviously both of them work.  So there you can see it's flush fit here.  with the bigger magwell and there you go so you can get a grip on the magwell if you need to.  you do have the grip safety.  the new trigger on this is what they're calling the meta trigger which stands for match enhanced trigger assembly.  you've got a flat trigger.  you've got an over travel stop and i'm not the biggest trigger snob.  it's got to be really bad for me to kind of complain about it but this trigger is very nice all right.  so flat trigger.  you've got the trigger safety as well.  Little bit of take up.  Not too spongy.  Hits the wall.  Kind of feels like it pushes it out a little bit.  See if I can get my thumb out the way.  And this one comes with a threaded barrel.  And real quick, I'll show you what else comes in the bag.  suppressor this does not come in the bag.  i threw this in there.  we'll have some fun with this later.  that's a silencer co hybrid 46. so the bag's kind of nice.  i like it better than the hard case.  got some pockets for magazines.  it comes with two mags and then you've got two little pockets for your pistols.  this is all tools for the suppressor.  and then you got a little front section.  That's my suppressor bag.  Manual.  This one came with a target, distance 10 meters.  Here's that.  The other one did not come with this, but you've got your regular gun lock.  It does come with removable back straps.  This is probably the standard one or the mid-size, and one is smaller, one is larger.  I'm not going to bother putting those on, but you can just pop the pin out of here just like the rest of them.  This feels pretty good in my hands, so I'm not going to bother with that.  Usually the standard back plates feel good in my hands.  I have, I'd say, average to small hands.  You do have an ambidextrous slide stop here on both sides.  Not something you have to remove and reverse, so that's kind of nice.  You also have ambidextrous magazine releases.  Right?  So there's no having to switch any controls back and forth.  It's just ambidextrous out of the box.  You've got a strike indicator here.  Let's see if that goes away.  You can see if you're cocked or not.  Obviously, like I said, it's got a threaded barrel, so you've got the cover.  So you can just screw on a suppressor, which we'll get to here in a little bit.  And the accessory rail, I've got this Olight on it, but I've got a few different lights here.  Got a TL01HL from Streamlight.  So there it is with the Streamlight TLR-1HL.  I've got a Surefire X300UA.  So that just slides on.  There it is with that.  That's flush with the threaded barrel.  Kind of nice.  So like I said, my overall impressions, it's a huge gun, but it doesn't feel that heavy.  It feels good in my hand.  One thing I noticed is when I was mounting this plate, it is not flush with the sides because the slide is kind of concave a little bit.  Here's my Glock 19 with an RMR.  There's a little bit of overhang, but not much.  But to be honest, now that it's on there, it doesn't really bother me much.  And I got a few other pistols I can compare it to.  Obviously not a fair comparison to the Glock 19, but I've got one of the older models, the XD M9 4.5, also a threaded barrel.  If you notice, this is all the same, but it's a lot bigger here.  You can see that.  They also have their XDM9 Match, same color, except the slide's black.  You can see again, it's a bit bigger.  And then here is a Glock 34 Gen 5, a lot bigger here.  It's a big grip.  So if you've got big hands, this might feel pretty good.  It feels good for me.  My pinky rests right in here.  So I can get some good pressure on that.  It feels pretty good.  Similar to the other ones, this releases the slide when you're disassembling it, but you've got a little bit of texture here.  So that feels good.  My thumb lands right on that in my grip.  So you can get some pressure with your thumb.  Here's what it looks like looking down.  You can see that concave slide.  and what it looks like with the RMR.  I do like that.  it's got suppressor high sights and they're black so there's no dots on them which is what I like when I'm running a red dot.  same thing I have on my Glock 19 just Dawson Precision suppressor high sights.  so you get a co-witness.  so no dots on the actual sights.  to kind of give you too many dots.  in that window there's your barrel.  that's a 5.28 inch barrel.  it's got a melanite finish hammer forged and a 1 in 16 twist.  You've got a one-piece full-length guide rod and it is all metal.  It feels pretty damn sturdy.  So let's put this thing together and get some shots downrange.  I'm here at MCTA range out in Mississippi by Stennis Space Center.  It's open to the public from Thursday to Sunday.  But if you're a member, you get 24-7 access to this place, which is awesome.  So you can come out here and do low-light training.  They also offer classes.  I just took a night gunfighter course.  That was pretty awesome.  So check them out.  I'll put their link in the description below.  There is one, two, three, four pistol bays.  Three bays for rifles and pistols back here.  They're also building out a 300... yard range, but that's not up and running yet.  It's a pretty cool place.  The first thing I'm going to do is try to zero this red dot real quick, and then we'll get to some more shooting.  As I'm loading this up, I'll just read off some specs here.  So this is obviously a nine millimeter.  I don't think I mentioned that.  It comes with two 22 round magazines.  The length is 8.82 inches long.  It's a huge gun.  The height is 8.875 inches and the grip width is 1.185 inches and the weight empty is 30.4 ounces.  And I did not bring my loader.  I think I've got 22 in there.  I lost count, whatever. ",
