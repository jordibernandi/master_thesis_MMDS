Yeah, you know exactly what I mean.  They stab you in the back and then they ask why you're bleeding.  I don't trust words, I trust action.  I don't care what you heard, I'm not slashing.  My name is Allen Roberts.  This is Everyday Fitness.  Like, subscribe, hit that notification bell right over here.  And share my videos.  Subscribe to my second channel, Allen Roberts.  My opinion, of course, is going to be linked above and below at the end.  And share those videos too, please and thank you.  That is Amberlynn Reid.  Amberlynn Reid is a YouTuber most famously known for gaining weight while she's trying to lose weight.  She is a full-blown food addict in my opinion, of course.  In my opinion, she actually needs to be institutionalized.  If she wants to lose weight and save her life, she needs to actually be put into a facility that is going to have her lose weight if she does not get the gastric bypass surgery.  She needs to be in an inpatient facility that will restrict her calories for her because she does not have the capability of doing so.  Nor, as we are about to see, does she have the support structure needed to in any way achieve long-term even short-term weight loss.  I fear that she is going to gain weight after this whole experience.  I am NOT going to act like I haven't seen this video before.  I've watched this video multiple multiple times shaking my head at it mostly because it is literally again step-by-step guide as to why food addicts fail when it comes to diets.  now the multi-level marketing plan notice Octavia or Octavia or whatever.  they are.  so one of their health coaches and I do use air quotes there, reached out to Amberlynn and said they had the plan for her, that they can help her lose weight, probably because they thought she had a decent outreach and they would, if they got her to lose any bit of weight, it would actually help their sales.  And that's just my opinion, of course.  I don't know that because I've never talked to the health coach.  I would love to talk to you, though.  By the way, if you are Amberlynn's health coach or Amberlynn, if you want to put me in contact with your health coach, I'd love to have a conversation with this person.  Absolutely love it.  Or anybody from Octavia that agrees addict with a binging disorder should have been on your program.  I'd absolutely love to hear how it wasn't just for the money.  I would love to hear it.  The $440 she likely spent on snacks. ",

            "text": "as the first tip the absolute first tip the first thing this woman opened was the thing she thought she'd liked the least and she loved the flavor of it.  Now, my message to Amberlynn and to food addicts everywhere, your enjoyment of food is over.  This is like a person saying that, you know, acting like they should still be able to enjoy the taste of beer, like a good stout, even though they're an alcoholic.  You don't get to enjoy that anymore.  And I know that sucks.  I know that's a harsh reality for people.  But if you enjoy food too much as a food addict, like basically at all, especially if you're not in your recovery, basically at all, you are going to relapse.  It is not an if.  It is a when.  It is an inevitability.  It is how... You're going to work for the rest of your life.  You will have an addiction.  And unfortunately for food addicts, and I've pointed this out many, many, many times, food addicts do not have the luxury of just not having some of their addiction every day.  It is not like an alcoholic who can just avoid a bar.  It is not like a heroin addict who can just avoid the street corner or wherever they get it.  Or it's not like which... It's not like most people's addiction, when we talk about addiction and drug addiction nowadays, most people that are addicted are addicted to opiates and they can just not visit that doctor again.  Anyway.  But food addicts need to eat food every day.  They need to eat a little bit of their addiction every single day, and that makes it very, very, very, very, very, very, very hard.  That makes the road to recovery an extreme daily fight.  It makes it a daily thing.  It makes it where a smell can set them off.  A smell that reminds them of their favorite food can set them off, can make them really have urges to eat and binge eat.  any type of stressors oftentimes if they're used to eating to comfort themselves any type of stress will cause them to eat.  there is no magic food plan that is going to take away food addiction.  for a person like her or other people that have eaten themselves to four five six seven hundred pounds there's no magic that is going to take away that food addiction.  even when somebody gets bariatric surgery they still have to deal with their addiction because bariatric surgery is just a purchasing of time to learn how to deal with their food addiction once they've reached the stage where their obesity will likely kill them.  That is all it is.  It is just a purchasing of time, and it is not even permanent because the stomach will stretch back out again.  That is why it is very, very, very important for people to understand that when they get bariatric surgery, they still need to take the steps to get healthy.  I have recently changed my opinion on bariatric surgery.  I thought it was just, it was not for anybody, but to show my 600, excuse me, has changed my opinion about that where I have seen where this surgery helps prolong somebody's life long enough to help them get a grasp on their addiction and hopefully they'll keep it.  But the idea is that many, many, many people that get bariatric surgery gain all the weight back.  It's like a 5% success rate.  That's it.  Many people just gain all the weight back.  It's just a temporary fix.  So giving somebody a plan like this that involves eating six times a day, that's one thing she said, eating six times a day.  For a food addict, eating six times a day is an opportunity to overeat six times a day. ",

The only time I would even suggest something like that is right after they've had bariatric surgery.  They do need to drink protein drinks because their stomach is not really processing food yet.  So they need to drink protein shakes in order to get protein in their body to help them heal.  That's it.  But for the most part, anybody, not just a food addict, but anybody trying to lose weight, drinking your calories is not all that intelligent.  It's just not.  If you're used to eating a huge volume of food, you are not going to want to all of a sudden fill yourself up with fluid and not eat that food.  drink water, fill yourself up with the fluid, and use the calories to eat voluminous foods.  Broccoli is your friend.  Eat three pounds of broccoli in a day.  People laugh at that, but that is true.  Eat three pounds of broccoli in a day.  It is great protein, great fiber, all sorts of micro and macronutrients that you would want and need, and it will help fill you up, not a candy bar like they sent this young lady.  Moving on to the other issues of why this video literally shows why food addiction is a thing that this woman's environment does not provide for her to do her cover.  It simply does not.  And here's why.  The very first night, the absolute very first night she is on this plan, She's talking about how they're going over friend's place and there's going to be trigger foods there. ",

            "text": "If you are eating yourself to death and the people around you do not support you enough to not have you in front of things that may trigger you to binge eat, have cravings, those sort of things.  If the people around you are anything but... telling you no, not having any crap food in the house, not having anything off of your nutrition plan set forth by your doctor or nutritionist or qualified health coach, If there is any way that they are not 100% supportive of that, you need to cut them out of your life.  You absolutely need to cut them out of your life because your life depends upon it.  I know you may miss them.  I know you may think you love them.  They, in my opinion, of course, do not love you.  And that might be something very harsh for people to hear.  They do not love you in that way.  They are not cognitive enough to understand that you are going to die if you eat another piece of pizza.  or another one of your trigger foods.  You could easily die.  It could be the thing that caused you to binge enough to gain enough weight to go on a binge and never stop to gain enough weight that it kills you.  They either don't understand that or they don't love you enough in order to help you recover from something that's going to kill you.  It is going to kill you.  If you have gained 100 pounds in the last year and people are still taking you out for pizza or eating pizza in front of you, remove yourself from them.  Get them out of the way.  At one point in time, she talks about when she does fall off.  after the second day, she falls off of this because she feels she was on too low of calories.  She feels she was.  As if this person is in any way a judge of this.  She says her doctor agrees because it was like 900 calories.  And while I agree that it's too low, I agree that's low.  It's not going to be much higher.  1,200 calories is max.  For somebody like her, she needs to lose weight fast.  I would not subscribe to that for somebody that needs to lose 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 pounds.  But somebody that needs to lose 300 pounds, 400 pounds, a 1,200 calorie diet is where you're going to be.  You can eat 1,200 counts of broccoli for all I care and fill yourself up and take a multivitamin and some other stuff to make sure you're getting all the stuff you need.  But you are not going to be eating much more than that.  To quit an entire nutrition plan because you feel the calories are too low, you're not a judge of what's too low.  You're not.  And if your doctor said you shouldn't be on it, okay, listen to your doctor.  Maybe get a second opinion because in reality, you should be hospitalized.  If your doctor realizes you're just eating yourself to death and hasn't suggested some sort of hospitalization, some sort of inpatient treatment, I would suggest you get a second opinion.  Because young lady, and any food addict that is 560 pounds and has gained 100 or 200 pounds in the last year or two, you're on the path to death.  You are going to be dead soon.  And that's horrible to say, and I often make jokes and laugh and everything like that and try to get people to laugh on my videos.  There is nothing funny about this at all.  This woman is killing herself on YouTube.  She is eating herself to death on YouTube, failing at every diet she tries because she is a food addict and diets don't even work for a normal person.  A healthy food lifestyle works for people.  She is not a healthy person.  She doesn't have a healthy relationship with food.  She does not have a healthy relationship with her body.  She does not have a healthy relationship with the truth.  And she also does not have a healthy relationship with the support system that is around her because at one point in time when she went off the diet, as I was getting to, She had a cup of noodles.  There should be no cup of noodles in your house.  In the video before this where she's unpacking this box from UpTV, this box of snacks, candy bars, they're basically candy bars.  Things that would trigger anybody to want to eat more of them.  Just be real.  When she was opening this month's worth supply of granola bars and shakes and sweet tasting shakes and all that, when she was opening that up, she said that they're removing everything bad out of the kitchen or everything bad out of the kitchen.  that's hers.  Her roommate or significant other or whatever she is, I haven't paid close enough attention just to be honest, is keeping their stuff, you know, because that's theirs.  Get a new roommate.  There should be nothing in your place.  You should not just be able to grab a cup of noodle.  You shouldn't be.  You shouldn't.  The person that is living with you, if you're living with anybody, should literally have control of your phone and make sure you don't order food.  That's reality.  You need to save your life.  That takes way precedent over the taste of food, whether you like something or not, whether it tastes good because multiple times in this video she was like, oh, I don't like the taste that much. ",

So who gives a shit if you like the flavor of it?  You've enjoyed the flavor of food enough.  You have.  You have eaten your lifetime quota of food enjoyment.  You don't get to enjoy food anymore.  Accept it.  It's like an alcoholic, like I said, accepting they can't drink anymore.  You don't get to enjoy food anymore.  That's just how that works.  You should want to eat only things that you dislike because then you won't eat a whole lot of them.  I know people are like, well, that doesn't work.  Neither does eating yourself to death.  Just saying.  People can find all sorts of different reasons why this won't work, that won't work.  The reality of it is, unless you change something permanently, you are gonna die a food addict.  You are going to die.  You need to accept the fact that you've enjoyed food enough.  You just have.  You've enjoyed food enough.  You liking whether the shake was good or you liking whether that bar was good or you liking whether you felt sustained enough, you're going to be very very very very hungry for a while.  and here's the reality.  it's still.  even if you even if she would get gastric bypass bariatric surgery even if she would get gastric bypass until she's treated the thing in her head that's making her binge eat she's still going to feel hungry.  she's still going to want to want that to relay over in some way.  i mean there's staggering statistics on how people that get bariatric surgery then become alcoholics.  I mean, this is a problem for her.  The environment she is in is a problem.  The environment of her popularity on YouTube, as I've said before, also depends largely upon this.  She could lose some weight and probably gain a little bit of popularity, but I think she's not seeing that.  She's not equating the fact that you know, that would also help her earn money.  Because right now, I do believe she's earning quite a bit of money on YouTube, eating herself to death, and that's a problem too.  And she's addicted to that too, if you ask me.  You know, again, I encourage everybody to watch these videos.  If you are a food addict, I encourage you to watch my videos.  and I encourage you to watch this young lady's videos because this is a what not to do tutorial on how to lose weight if you're a food addict.  It is literally a what not to do.  Now, I really do hope that this young lady gets control of her life.  Amberlynn, you can reach out to me on Facebook if you will.  You know, I'm not saying I'm going to help you because I don't know if you're ready to be helped yet.  And you probably hate my guts because I'm telling you the truth.  And that's normally how that shit works.  But you can absolutely reach out to me and my wife.  We will try to do whatever we can for you within reason.  But you need to help yourself.  One of the best things I think you can do is you can consult your doctor about going to an inpatient facility until you've lost about 100 pounds.  Because right now, you're teetering.  You're very much teetering.  She's teetering.  You are teetering on... The stage of immobility and food binging that is going to skyrocket you up another couple hundred pounds into death.  Whichever comes first.  And that would be just truly tragic.  And I do hope that doesn't happen.  And that's just my two cents on the matter.  My name is Alan Roberts.  Hit me up on Instagram at Everyday Fitness.  Hit me up on Twitter at Everyday Fitness.  I'm also on Facebook at Everyday Fitness.  And my internet at EverydayFitness.net.
