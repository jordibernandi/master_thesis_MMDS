Perhaps even more impressive, $600,000 of that haul was from individuals who set up recurring monthly contributions, meaning that presumably should they remain with Bernie until election day, Bernie would pull in another $12 million just from those who signed up on day one.  and the backlash from the mainstream media has already begun.  Also within 24 hours of his declaration, the Washington Post published four anti-Bernie Sanders columns with titles like Bernie Sanders is no big deal the second time around, and Bernie Sanders is probably just another one-hit wonder.  In this video, I'll break down some of the mainstream media's history of bias against Bernie Sanders before putting a spotlight on one more subtle attack put out by CNN's YouTube show, The Point.  I'm choosing to focus in a bit on this one particular video because I believe it serves as the perfect case study of mainstream media bias against Sanders and the progressive movement.

            "text": "Mainstream media attacks on Bernie Sanders and his supporters are by no means new or novel.  A study by Harvard University indicates that there was a media blackout against him, which damaged his 2016 primary campaign.  Sanders struggled to get badly needed press attention in the early going.  With almost no money or national name recognition, he needed news coverage if he was going to gain traction.  By summer, Sanders had emerged as Clinton's leading competitor, but even then, his coverage lagged.  Five Republican contenders, Trump, Bush, Cruz, Rubio, and Carson, each had more news coverage than Sanders during the invisible primary.  Clinton got three times more coverage than he did.  While coverage of Sanders has obviously swelled as he has risen to become a national figure, negative coverage persists.  A particularly egregious example was the 2017 article in the New York Times called Attack Tests.  Movement Sanders Founded, which blamed Bernie and his movement for the Steve Scalise shooting.  The editorial, disguised as a news article, claimed that shooting on Wednesday, which wounded four people, may prove to be an unexpected test for a movement born out of Sanders' left-wing populist politics and a moment for liberals to figure out how to balance anger at Trump with inciting violence.  In fact, Sanders has never called for violence.  Rather, he has condemned it at every turn, including in this instance.  While perhaps more subtle, the media bias against Sanders is perhaps most damaging on cable news outlets like CNN.  While CNN is often labeled as liberal and fake news by conservatives and Trump supporters respectively, it recently faced backlash for hiring Sarah Isgar, a long-time GOP operative who served in Trump's Justice Department and once called CNN the Clinton News Network.  Progressives have yet to experience the same level of concessions from the outlet.  During the 2016 campaign, CNN habitually included the yet-to-be-cast superdelegate votes in their tallies, thus inflating the perception of Clinton's primary lead.  Along with Fox and MSNBC, CNN refused to cover a major Bernie Sanders speech in front of a crowd of thousands, instead filling the time with general punditry and teasing a speech that Trump would be delivering later on.  Six months ago, Jake Tapper decided to fact-check a claim that Bernie Sanders made, quoting a Koch brother-funded study.  Sanders had not made a false claim.  But Tapper managed to claim that he had by reinterpreting Sanders claims about saving Americans money to mean saving the government money. ",

I addressed that issue in the other Sanders 2020 video I made, but here's a little additional information.  Like a full 44% of Americans, including much of the Democratic voting base, Sanders is an independent.  But like most independents, he has a clear preference between the two major parties.  He has caucused with the Democrats his entire congressional career, and has campaigned for Democrats as far back as Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential run.  Because of new DNC rules, Sanders will have to sign an affirmation of loyalty to the party, which his campaign claims he will do.  I find it pretty annoying when Democrats attack him over his status as an independent.  Clinton criticized his independence in her book, but he wasn't too much of an independent when she sought his endorsement and presence on the campaign trail in 2016.  Nor was he too independent when the DNC included many of his ideas in the party platform.  Now, as I see it, this criticism against Sanders is both toothless and played out.  But for Kalizza, it's a pressing issue. ",

With lots of people running for the Democratic nomination who have been lifelong Democrats, is it worth voting for a guy who, by his own admission, is taking on the cloak of being a Democrat because he knows he can't win as an independent candidate for president?  It's a good question.  And I don't know the answer to that question.  Maybe Democratic voters don't care.  Maybe they dated Bernie in 2016, but are going to marry him, politically speaking, in 2020.  But count me as skeptical. ",

First they ignored him, then they smeared him, and now they dismiss him as implausible despite all evidence to the contrary.  Kind of reminds me of that famous quote Gandhi never actually said.  When it comes to the resistance Sanders has regularly faced in the so-called liberal media, I think we might want to consider motive.  What's the point? ",
