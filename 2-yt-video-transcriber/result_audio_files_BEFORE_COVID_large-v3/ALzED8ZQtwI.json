            "text": "What's good, YouTube?  It's Young Man's Daily Red Pill back with another upload.  And as you can tell from the title, I wanted to basically address today the fact that your ex is not thinking about you right now.  Or whoever you were dealing with.  She's not thinking about you.  I'm sorry to break the news to you, bro.  She's not thinking about you.  She has moved on and she is thinking about the other... meat stick digging her out, basically.  that's what she's thinking about.  she's on to the next guy.  um being a hypergamous woman which all females have hypergamy inside them she is no longer thinking about you.  she has already moved on.  so while you sit here and you think about what she's up to and what she's doing and how you can get her back and ways that you can work your way into getting her back she has already moved on and in fact she probably moved on midway through if not the very beginning of your relationship or as soon as you show signs of being beta or blue pill and most likely even if you did show signs of being red pill and alpha She was still probably being hypergamous and still thought the grass was greener on the other side and still left your ass.  And that's just facts.  These women don't care.  These women don't care.  what you do for them.  What you did in the past is irrelevant.  What have you done now?  What have you done recently?  And that's still irrelevant.  Man, it's a cold world out there.  I'm trying to tell y'all, man.  Don't get in a relationship.  Do not get in a relationship.  Don't put yourself through that stress.  Live the single free agent lifestyle as Coach Greg Adams would say.  Do you want that stress of a relationship?  You won't have to constantly be thinking about what your woman's doing, how to satisfy her, how to please her, how to make her feel like she's the princess or the queen.  You don't want to have to deal with that.  Get your money.  Get your bread.  Live the life that you want to live as a free agent man.  And stop worrying about your ex and move on.  Boss up in life.
