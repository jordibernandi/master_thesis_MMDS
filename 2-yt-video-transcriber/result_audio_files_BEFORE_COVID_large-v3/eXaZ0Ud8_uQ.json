            "text": "What's going on, guys?  Get these white glasses off.  What's going on, man?  I'm just driving.  How y'all living?  Checking in with the Instagram people.  Goddamn filters.  Shit.  What's happening, man?  How y'all living, man?  Hope y'all had a productive day today.  What's going on, Mira?  A lot of ladies in here.  What y'all asses doing on a Thursday night all up on the ground?  Y'all taking pictures of your titties or something?  A lot of women in here.  What y'all got going on?  Is it titty Thursday?  Shit, there's a lot of women up in here.  What's happening with you?  God damn, I'm driving and I don't want this filter on me with these goofy ass glasses.  Damn.  But just want to check in with y'all.  There's men in here, too.  I see a couple of you.  A lot of ladies.  I'm not complaining.  Shit, I wasn't complaining.  Just a lot of ladies in here.  Wasn't complaining.  Oh, I got to get this dumbass filter off, man.  I'm driving.  I got one handle on my selfie stick and another handle on the steering wheel.  And this shit, I look like a cartoon going back and forth.  But I hope y'all... How the hell do I get this off?  Damn.  Hold on, guys.  Let me get this.  There you go.  There you go.  I got it off.  Damn.  All right.  So how y'all doing, man?  Just wanted to touch on some things real quick.  And I just did a video on my YouTube channel talking about this.  You know, a lot of people are still talking about the case.  Um, when is the next thing?  I don't know.  The minks like, I don't know, but I'm gonna go in the studio.  We're going in the studio to work on the new mink slide EP pretty soon.  And plus I'm working on a book right now, but you know, a lot of people are still talking about, you know, the Amber Geiger case and, um, the both and John thing.  And that judge, a lot of people are pissed at that judge.  Tammy, the mammy.  Yeah.  Judge Tammy, the mammy has pissed everybody off.  Black folks.  She pissed up some white folks.  Because black folks were getting at her.  She took down her Facebook.  And a lot of people are complaining that she brought religious bias to the courtroom.  A lot of people, and I'm talking about white people, they felt a little funny about that.  When she got off that bench reading a goddamn Bible verse and hugging Amber Geiger, even white people were like, what the hell?  We've never seen this before.  You know, that kind of really that made a mockery of the judicial system when you're doing stuff like that.  When you're that much of a mammy, she over-mammyed.  She went overboard with the mammying to the point where they were like, well, I don't know about this.  This is a little bit too much.  You know, you kind of stepped over the mammy boundaries on that one.  You know, but one thing that we got to keep in mind, family, I need some light in here.  It's getting dark.  Hold on.  You don't see me pretty good.  I don't want to be in the total dark chopping it up with y'all.  But one thing, and I was talking about this on Instagram, these lawyers, we got to watch these, these Negro lawyers.  A lot of them are basically settlement lawyers.  who, who they instruct their clients to do all that bug dancing and cooning.  What's up, pink toes?  How are you, dear?  Everybody shout out to the lovely pink toes over there.  But one thing, like I said, you watch out for some of these Negro lawyers out here who you always see connected to these families, connected to these big, high-profile, black, racialized cases, and these niggas never really win anything.  You see these guys all the time.  Every single case, they're right there in the mix.  But there's no real punishment for the race soldiers or the white supremacists.  There's really no punishment for them, but these niggas are still in the mix.  So why is that?  Why is that?  These are basically settlement lawyers and what they do.  They try to appear that they're on a grassroots level, but they're not.  They really get us on the streets to kind of make a lot of noise.  And then what happens?  They make a deal with the city.  They get a little settlement deal.  And this is why the families, the families be out there crying at first.  And then all of a sudden the family is out there forgiving every damn body.  Because there's a settlement bag that the Negro lawyer has negotiated.  And part of the settlement is for them to go in court, buck dancing it up and forgiving every damn body.  You understand?  So that's part of the game.  Because Botham John's brother, the way he was buck dancing in court, the way he was cooning, the lawyers were in on that.  There's just no way that nigga went in court cooning like that.  The lawyers were in on it.  And that was part of the deal.  That was part of the deal.  If you want some of this settlement money from the city, you got to calm everybody down.  Don't go hard on Amber.  This is how much of a coon that family is and some of these lawyers too.  But they orchestrate their clients to go in there buck dancing it up so that settlement check can be nice and big so the lawyers can get their cut and then go out to the press conferences talking tough.  Yeah, we need police reform.  Yeah, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, there's contamination with the air, but it's shit the fuck up.  Y'all niggas was just in court, shining your shoes, tap dancing.  Don't come out here around black folks talking tough.  I'm tired of that con game.  these niggas are running.  This is a con game.  Con, con, con, and we got to cut all that bullshit out.  You ding?  That dad is talking about, I want to be friends with Amber.  There's a bag that they're dangling over these niggas' faces.  This was a hardcore Caribbean coon family.  This family did some hardcore Caribbean cooning.  that was just unfathomable.  We got our own coons, but that cooning, they took cooning to a whole different level.  Have zero respect for them.  Zero.  This is why we got to circle our wagons.  Tammy the Mammy, she sealed her fate in the judicial system and in the public eye.  Nobody's really supporting her anymore.  She's out the door.  She's not going to get reelected.  She just sacrificed the bench to probably get that one last little bag.  Ding.  Yeah, so that family, and a lot of us think that they got paid big money.  They probably didn't even get paid big money.  They probably didn't even get paid big money.  They probably got a couple of hundred thousand dollars.  That's how coonish they are and how much in love with white folks they are.  Let me put my light on.  Where's my light?  Damn, this didn't do no better.  Okay, where's my lights in my car?  Okay, fuck it.  Yeah, it's kind of dark.  Y'all can't see me for nothing.  Yeah, man.  So, you know, it's a shameful display.  And another thing, All these fake-ass people in the dominant society cosigning that coonery because fake-ass people are like, oh, God.  These are people in white society.  Oh, God.  Botham John's brother is so brave.  He's so Christ-like.  I mean, that's a good-hearted Christian.  They're really pumping it up.  They're pumping up that buffoonery because they want all of us to have that mentality.  They want all of us to be in a position where if you harm our family, we'll sit up there and allow it and pray and hug on you.  No, we are not them Caribbean coons.  Nope.  Absolutely not.  We are not those Caribbean coons at all.  All of us ain't like that.  Because what's funny, they sit up here talking about how great it is that he's forgiving, but none of these people are condemning Amber Geiger.  They're not condemning her racism.  They're not saying she deserves more punishment.  You understand?  So I don't want to hear all that fake Christian bullshit y'all talking.  You understand me?  The gifted son?  No, you white supremacists are a joke.  That's what's the joke.  You're the joke, white supremacists.  She'll be out in a couple of years.  She'll be out in about three years, if that.  She's going to be right on up out of there.  All that cooning they did, they're going to keep running that over and over again to justify letting her out of jail early.  That's what they're going to do.  Those Negroes are the worst doing all that.  That's exactly what they're going to use to justify letting her out or even putting her in jail, period.  Nigga, I would like to see if she goes to jail, period.  The way they were bug dancing and cooning for her.  You understand?  I mean, they're treating her like the damn victim.  So, yeah, they... All that mammying and samboism, you know, that's the justification they're going to use to let her go.  They're like, well, the family said it was okay, and Tammy the mammy said it was okay.  You know?  But anyway, let me get out of here.  I'm almost home.  I'll probably go live again later on tonight.  So y'all hang tight, man.  Holla. ",
