            "text": "Mr.  Whitaker, you're clearly not going to answer the question, so I'm going to move on.  You know Professor John Barrett, correct?  Well, anyway, this is a law school professor who tweeted that you told him in June of 2017 that you were flying out from Iowa to New York City to be on CNN regularly because you were hoping to be noticed as a Trump defender and through that to get a Trump judicial appointment back in Iowa.  You then went on to describe the Mueller appointment of the special counsel as ridiculous and a little fishy, that Mueller investigating Trump's finances would be going too far, that there is no criminal obstruction of justice charge to be had against President Trump, that there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign, that any candidate would have taken the same meeting as Donald Trump Jr.  with a Russian lawyer, and finally, that a replacement for Sessions could reduce Mueller's budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.  You said all those things, and they're all in print.  And it answers Mr.  Deutsch's question.  The American people wonder, just how is it that Mr.  Whitaker becomes the acting Attorney General of the United States in violation of existing statutes?  Was he put there for a particular purpose?  That wasn't a question.  It's a statement.  I yield back. ",
