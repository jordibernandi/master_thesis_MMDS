            "text": "The Internationale, or l'Internationale in the original French, is widely recognized as the unofficial anthem of the international left wing.  From communists to anarchists, syndicalists to socialists, and even some social democrats hold this one song on a pedestal as the song to represent their views and their aims.  Although if you ask a social democrat what the song is actually about, I doubt they'd be able to give you an accurate answer.  So what is the song actually about?  I mean, what even is an international?  The lyrics of the song were written by a French anarchist and member of the Paris Commune, Eug\u00e8ne-\u00c9dine Potier, in 1871.  The song was originally set to the tune of La Maci\u00e8s.  But in 1888, Belgian communist Pierre de Gaeta composed an original tune for the song.  The song was written for the 1864 Congress of the International Workingmen's Association, also known as the First International.  The purpose of the Internationale was to, for the first time, get all the workers of the world who wanted self-determination into a single international organization which would fight for the right of the working class and the overthrow of capitalism and the class system, and the establishment of a new socialist society.  and the anthem of this organisation reflects those goals.

            "text": "This first verse is undoubtedly about working class revolution and about what is called the final struggle, referring to the final class struggle.  Remember this song was written only 16 years after the revolutions of 1848, which saw working class and middle class people rise up against the old monarchical order in over 50 European countries, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths but also an end to serfdom, an absolute monarchy and even an introduction of democracy in some countries.  The line of the past let us make a clean slate refers to the abolition of capitalism and the creation of a completely new socio-economic system called socialism, also referred to as communism during this time.  The words socialism and communism were essentially synonymous and meant the same thing in 1864.  The chorus of the song continues with a revolutionary theme and goes Thank you very much.  The International Workingmen's Association had between 5 and 8 million members across the world.  So saying that the Internationale will be the human race isn't necessarily an inaccurate statement.  If things had continued as they did and the socialist workers had been more successful, the Internationale very well could have become the human race in the sense that an organization like the United Nations represents the human race.

            "text": "This verse speaks of working class self-determination, that change will not come from above, that the fate of the workers is in the hands of the workers alone.  The word thief refers to the capitalist class, the bourgeoisie.  In socialist economic theory, there is something called extraction of surplus value, described by Karl Marx as primitive accumulation, where the capitalist or boss or CEO or owner or whatever you want to call him, continually struggles to simultaneously raise his prices and consequently the cost of living for the working class and lower his workers' wages.  By doing this, he increases the total amount of surplus value or profit that he can extract.  To Marx, this extraction is simply theft, value stolen from hard-working labourers to line the pockets of the rich.  the line so that the spirit be pulled from its prison refers to alienation a sociological theory about how soul-crushing work can be when you feel that the work you're doing is pointless repetitive without purpose and without value to the rest of society.  communism seeks to get rid of alienation by creating a society in which people are free to work with what they want out of a passion and a love for what they do rather than financial economic necessity i.e having to work because you have to make money in order to pay rent and buy food even though shelter and food are human rights or at least should be.

The state, in socialist theory, is a tool utilised by the ruling class to impose its will on the rest of society.

So in summary, what exactly does the Internationale say?  It says that our current capitalist system is built on the exploitation of workers, on war, and on systematic inequality, which favors the rich and powerful bourgeois class at the expense of everyone else.  But the song is meant to be hopeful.  It can be sung both in times of celebration and in times of defiance, in times of either great struggle or great prosperity.  It tells of a future which can be free and equal, fair and righteous, built on the right of workers to reap what they sow.  If you're new to socialism and socialist ideals, the kind of ideas talked about in this song, then I have a website.  called socialism101.com.  Socialism 101 is a website that I created in order to gather a lot of common questions about socialism and also as a way to explain some of the more complicated aspects of socialism.
