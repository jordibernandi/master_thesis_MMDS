It just comes with the territory of weaning or introducing solids, I should say, because... We're still primarily breastfeeding.  Speaking of, it is time for him to eat again.  I always nurse right before he eats any solids.  And I was gonna do chickpeas, but we don't have any, so it'll be okay without it.

There were only a very few vegans before that.  There were some parents who now try to only feed their babies plants and you have seen the news.  They died or at two years old they looked like they were one month old because nothing in the human body is going to develop.  It is biochemically impossible to feed a baby only plants.
