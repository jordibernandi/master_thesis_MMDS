            "text": "Hi my name's Phil and I like talking about politics and in this viewers choice I'll be discussing the reasons why the hardline Brexiteers are so desperate for the UK to leave the EU before the end of 2019, even when they know it comes at the cost of major panic in the country and almost certain electoral oblivion for the Conservative Party, at least for the next generation.  But first if you find yourself enjoying the video then please click the like button and subscribe to the channel.  So, why are the hardline Brexiteers so desperate for us to leave the EU in 2019?  And why did they sink the withdrawal agreement when they couldn't care less about customs arrangements in Ireland?  After all, if May's withdrawal agreement went through, the UK would now be out of the EU.  Despite the narrative that the government tried to give, it was actually Brexiteers who blocked our exit from the EU.  But although you might imagine that the Brexiteer motivations are complex, Their desperation to leave quickly and their general desire to do so without an agreement are both explained by the same thing.  Taxation.  The UK is a bit of a pirate state when it comes to taxation.  Nefarious financial activities are often associated with Switzerland.  But when you take into account British overseas territories, Britain leads the world in money laundering and tax avoidance.  This is not only inviting major criminal activity within the EU, but meaning that honest operators were at a disadvantage competitively.  Recently we've had huge multinationals like Facebook and Amazon avoiding paying very much tax at all and yet raking in huge profits, the like of which would make Solomon blush.  Businesses were taking the piss and so the EU's anti-tax avoidance directive was born, which I have to say the UK didn't oppose.  The Directive is actually very good news for the people of Britain and would provide a big boost to public services through increased tax receipts.  The wealthy tax avoiders try to say that if we tighten up on tax laws that they'll just take their business elsewhere.  But this is a lie.  There are larger economies than ours with much stricter tax laws and those businesses do not leave because of it.  Businesses go wherever there is profit, even if it's not as much.  It's just another deception, along with the trickle-down theory used as an excuse for the super wealthy to be above the law.  And when it comes to tax avoidance, there are a couple of bits of model thinking.  First of all, people point out that it's legal.  Yes, it is.  And why is it legal?  Because the politicians who make the laws allow for these loopholes to allow themselves, their friends and their donors to swindle the country.  It's legal because it's allowed to be legal, not because it should be.  Secondly, people just accept that taxation is complicated and that clever accountants will find a way around.  Well, that may well be, but it hasn't stopped the EU coming up with a set of systems to block the most common types of tax avoidance.  And this is what has the Brexiteers shaking in their shoes.  Forget about deliberately crashing the UK economy to make a fortune by shorting the pound.  That's just a handy little sideline they have.  The real reason behind Brexit was so that they could maintain their tax-free lifestyle, piling up vast sums of money that they don't even really spend.  It doesn't come back to the economy.  So why are Brixiteers so desperate for us to leave the EU without a deal?  After all, they say they want us to leave, and how annoyed they are that we didn't leave in March.  but it's they who voted against us leaving in March.  It's part of this directive, already been online, but being fully implemented on January 1st 2020.  Although we'd have left the EU by then, according to the original timetable, we'd be in the transition period, and that transition period required us to follow EU rules for its duration.  This is why they latched onto the backstop as an objection.  They don't care about customs arrangements in Northern Ireland.  They're interested only in financial markets.  They picked on the backstop because they knew it was divisive, something that most people in Britain don't really understand, and something that can't be removed.  The real objection they had was to any agreement at all.  They needed us out of the tax avoidance directive, not so much the EU.  But any agreement at all was bound to need alignment on these tax avoidance laws.  And it wasn't enough for them to just sit it out.  When these laws come fully online, the secrecy with which these wealthy elites conduct their financial affairs disappears.  \u00a37 million would have been allocated towards you.  How very interesting.  Are they right, \u00a37 million?  The amount I received that is not for public disclosure is not for public disclosure.  Maybe not at the time, Jacob, but from next year you won't be able to hide the truth.  And that scared both him and the really super wealthy people and corporations whose financial dealings would suddenly be subject to scrutiny.  it would be more accountability for them as it would be easier to follow money trails in corruption cases.  Less money for these people and businesses but much more money for public services for the country.  It was a living nightmare for these people and this is why they're so desperate to leave now.  They dare not let us get to next January, still in the EU.  They're pulling out all the stops.  The UK has been preparing to implement this directive in time.  We won't find ourselves in January without it implemented, with the argument that, well, we're leaving anyway, what's the point?  No, Parliament has been working on it, and as far as I know, it will be ready to roll.  So everything is being done to get us out without a deal, plunging the country into chaos this October.  To this end, they toppled May, who has been far too obedient to Parliament, and got behind Johnson, who was willing to shill himself for this cause.  They're continuing to deny any problems at all will occur as soon as we leave, because it's imperative for them that public pressure is on MPs not to block it.  Parliament can easily stop this if all MPs who know how damaging it is simply say no with one voice.  Fortunately for the Brexiteers, there is sufficient disunity amongst their ranks to give them a chance of succeeding this autumn.  As long as they keep tight control of Boris Johnson, then there are only two options for Parliament, as far as I can tell anyway, revoke Article 50 or replace the Prime Minister.  Parliament do not want to revoke without another referendum, and the idea of replacing the Prime Minister is currently being blocked by Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Opposition.  So if this impasse continues and too many MPs stand on the bylines, rather than sticking their heads above the parapets, then the Brexiteers will likely succeed in having us leave without a deal.  Yes, it will be devastating and that devastation will be immediately obvious.  There will be no crowing on this channel from Brexiteers and me telling them just to wait for a few months.  The effects will be immediate according to every expert on the matter, including the reports prepared by our own government.  Even Michael Gove, a hard Brexiteer cabinet minister, has suggested making November the 1st a bank holiday to reduce the panic in the markets.  The Brexiteers know full well what will happen, but they don't care.  The prize is keeping their wealth secret.  It means they keep more of it without having to pay those bothersome taxes.  And it means they can keep pumping dubious donations into corrupt payments without the trail being easy to track.  But there is one thing I have to confess to not quite understanding about all this.  Once we leave, the effects become undeniable.  There will be the most overwhelming calls for us to deal with the EU.  That deal surely has to involve implementing this tax directive.  So surely Brexit would just be a temporary reprieve for them.  I really don't understand how they think Brexit will give them their permanent pirate haven for financial affairs.  Perhaps they think that they can continue to exercise control over government.  And perhaps they also think that the EU will accept a deal that doesn't involve the tax directive.  It would be blinkered and arrogant, but those are common traits among such people.  So there you are.  Those are the real reasons behind the Brexiteers being so mad keen to get a no deal exit before the end of the year.  Hope you found the video interesting.
