            "text": "Shalom, chavarim.  One of the more fun words you're gonna hear here in Israel is the word l'chaim, and we use it when we toast in celebration, l'chaim.  It means to life.  Do you remember the movie Fiddler on the Roof on Friday night when he sings, to life, to life, l'chaim?  Now every Shabbat, when we gather around as a family, my children and husband and I, we take our glasses and after we bless the wine, before we drink, we toast our glasses together and everybody scrambles around the table to try and get each glass toasted.  So this week, as you toast or as you gather to celebrate the Shabbat, maybe you can add this tradition to your family and say, to life, l'chaim, from my family to yours.  Thank you. ",
