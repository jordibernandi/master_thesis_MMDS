            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  We're entering in to the fall feasts, beginning with the Feast of Trumpets, Yom HaTorah, September 29th, sundown.  When studying the Feast of the Lord, it's very important to realize what the Bible says in context.  Matthew 15, verse 3.  We understand that the context of this Bible verse is Yeshua, Jesus, speaking to the Pharisees, the religious leaders of that time.  So the question has to be asked.  If Yeshua, Jesus, God, rebuked the Pharisees for not following the word of God, why do some believers follow the rabbis in the name of Jesus?  A lot of it has to do with misunderstandings.  or a love for the Jewish people in the wrong way.  Whatever the reason might be, it is clear that there is spiritual warfare involved in it, that the enemy, Satan, doesn't want the true gospel to be preached.  Let's begin here with one of the misunderstandings of the Feast of Trumpets, Yom HaToah.  Jews who do not believe in Yeshua, do not believe in Jesus, have been taught that the Feast of Trumpets is actually the New Year.  when according to God's word, the new year starts in the season of unleavened bread, Passover.  Exodus chapter 12, verses 2 and 3.  This month is to be for you the first month of the year.  Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.  So we can see here that it is the tenth of Nisan, And it is the season of the preparation for Unleavened Bread Passover.  That is to be the first day of the year according to the biblical calendar.  And God's word does not change.  What changes is man's word.  And we are not to follow man.  We are to follow only Jesus, only God.  So the question is... Why do the Jewish people celebrate the New Year in the Feast of Trumpets instead of in the season of the Feasts of Unleavened Bread Passover?  There are many points and answers to this question.  I'll focus on a few.  Point number one, they do not have the Holy Spirit, the Voh HaKodesh.  And when you do not have the Holy Spirit, you have to invent something to make up for the Bible.  verses that are misunderstood.  Point number two, they read the Scriptures with a spirit of rejection of Yeshua, Jesus.  And the whole Bible, the whole Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, is written about Yeshua.  Yeshua is the Word.  Psalms 40 verse 7, Then I said, Behold, I come in the scroll of the book, it is written of me.  So wherever you read in the Bible, especially in the Feast of the Lord, Jesus Yeshua is everywhere.  And when you come in a spirit of rejection against Yeshua, against Jesus, you must change these Bible passages to suit your own traditions.  Then I said, Behold, I come in the scroll of the book, it is written of me.  that scroll is the whole bible.  john chapter 1 verse 14. and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory as of the only son from the father full of grace and truth.  and the word became flesh and tabernacled among us.  let's read the word of god in context and read about the Feast of Trumpets and see if there's any mention in the Word of God of a new year.  Numbers 29, verse 1.  On the first day of the seventh month, you shall have a holy convocation.  You shall not do any ordinary work.  It is a day for you to blow the trumpets.  And in Hebrew, it is called Yom HaToah.  Yom means day, Toah means blowing.  The day of the blowing of the trumpets.  It has nothing to do with the new year.  Yeshua is the feast.  And in the feasts of the Lord are multiple fulfillments pointing to the second coming of Messiah Yeshua, even the feasts that were fulfilled.  Just like the seven trumpets in the book of Revelation don't blow at one time, so the idioms in the feasts of the Lord, the feasts of trumpets, don't blow at one time in the prophetic.  The religious leaders didn't understand that, or should we say, didn't want to understand that, and changed it to the new year, thus losing the focus of the feast of the Lord.  And the third main point is, Satan knows that his days are numbered.  Satan knows that Israel is the key.  So he tries to move the Jewish people, blind them from seeing the gospel, from seeing the truth, and changing God's word and God's time.  And in the process, not just blinding the Jews who don't believe in Jesus, but blinding some believers that do believe in Jesus and following these traditions.  If we follow rabbis and tradition in the name of Yeshua, The Bible says that we're grieving the Holy Spirit.  And it really doesn't matter how man tries to justify himself.  It matters only what the Word of God says.  Ephesians 4, verse 30, And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.  Brothers and sisters, if we teach or we follow the rabbis by proclaiming that the Feast of Trumpets is the new year, we are grieving the Holy Spirit, and we are preaching a different gospel.  And Paul, under the inspiration of the Woch HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit, warned about this.  galatians chapter 1 verse 8. but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preach to you let them be under god's curse.  adding or changing the word of god is a different gospel.  it is very important to emphasize that when yeshua jesus proclaims in his word, I have come in the scroll of the book.  The word for scroll there is the word Megillah.  Behold, I have come in the Megillah of the book.  And the word for Megillah, scroll, actually means that which is hidden shall be revealed, which means the word of God is everything from Genesis to Revelation.  And the only way to understand the hidden mysteries of the Bible is through the Holy Spirit.  And the Bible says, do not grieve that Holy Spirit.  Revelation, chapter 22, verse 18.  I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll.  If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to the person the plagues described in this scroll.  And as we said before.  earlier in the teaching, the word scroll is the word Megillah.  Behold, I have come in the scroll of the book.  It's the whole word of God, not just the book of Revelation.  If we follow or teach that the Feast of Trumpets is the new year, we are adding to the Word of God.  And God warns us not to do this.  1 Corinthians 9, verse 20.  To the Jews I became like a Jew to win the Jews.  In no way is Paul saying that he's following the rabbis here.  What he's saying is he's preaching the gospel through the culture that they understand in order to win them to Messiah Yeshua.  There is a big difference between using the culture to preach the gospel and engaging in the culture as the true word of God and teaching it in your congregations.  In Israel right now, Jews are greeting Shana Tova, Happy New Year, everywhere.  I greet them back, Shana Tova, Happy New Year, not because I'm compromising the word of God, because I open a conversation with them, and I'm able to preach the gospel and show them the truth.  This is what Paul meant in 1 Corinthians 9, verse 20.  I also, when I go into an Orthodox city or I preach to Orthodox Jews, I wear a head covering, a yarmulke, a kippah.  It's not in the Word of God, but I do it in order to open a conversation with them.  Otherwise, they won't open the Word of God with me and draw them into the true gospel.  I don't wear it in conferences, and I don't wear it in my congregation and teach others to do it.  That grieves the Holy Spirit.  So we have to draw the line between what is for preaching the gospel, to draw people into the gospel, and what is following the rabbis in the name of Yeshua and grieving the Holy Spirit.  Two separate things, and there must be a line between them.  For example, when I walk into a mosque, I'm told not to come in with a short shirt.  So I wear a long shirt to respect their culture, not because I compromise the Word of God, because God opens the door for me to go in there and use their culture in order to preach the truth.  But I don't go around teaching in my congregation that every man has to wear a long shirt only.  There's a big difference between using the culture to preach the Gospel and teaching that the culture is the Word of God.  So this is what Paul meant.  To the Jew, I was a Jew.  And to the Greek, I was a Greek.  This is what he's talking about.  We preach the truth.  We use the culture without compromising the word of God.  The gospel must be preached.  It's also very important to emphasize that we're not against the Jewish people.  We love the Jewish people.  I was once an Orthodox Jew, but we cannot love people over righteousness.  The gospel must be preached.  As believers in Yeshua, we should stop proclaiming that this is a new year and start proclaiming what the Word of God said, that it is the Feast of Trumpets, Yom HaTorah.  As believers in Yeshua, we understand that the Feast of Trumpets is point to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua.  1 Corinthians 15, verse 52... In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised, imperishable, and we shall be changed.  The feast of trumpets points to the last trumpet, as we eagerly wait to meet the Lord in the air and go home.  And this is why it's so important that the truth be preached.  As long as the Jews are hearing a message that it's a new year, they'll never be prepared for the last and seventh trumpet.  It's our duty as believers in Yeshua, as ambassadors for the kingdom, as priests to preach the truth and not compromise the word of God.  The teaching of the new year is a very dangerous teaching because it comes from the Pharisees, from the Talmud.  It does not come from the written word of God.  Brothers and sisters, and until that time, we're in spiritual warfare.  This is a battle, and we have to hear the trumpet, which is really prophetically God's voice.  1 Corinthians 14, verse 8.  Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for the battle?  We have to sound a clear call, and that's the Word of God.  In everything in the Old Testament, it's a shadow of the new.  We find this in Numbers 10, verse 9.  When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound the blast on the trumpets.  Then you will be remembered by the Lord your God and rescued for your enemies.  This Bible verse is a compound Bible verse.  It is also speaking about spiritual warfare.  But if we don't preach the true gospel, how will we be prepared?  How will the Jews come to know that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah?  This is why it's so important not to follow the rabbis, but to follow only the written word of God in context.  We stand together in prayer.  for the nations and for the nation of Israel to come to know that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah as we blow the trumpets in the spiritual realm with our praise and with worship.  The Bible is not like politics.  In politics, they want to be politically correct.  As Bible followers, God-fearing men and women, we have to be Yeshua correct and not compromise the Word of God.  We hear the joyful sound.  We preach the joyful sound. ",
