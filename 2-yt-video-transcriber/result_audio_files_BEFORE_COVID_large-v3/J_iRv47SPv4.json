What guys if you haven't seen it by now that's on you, the next Spider-Man's nearly out.  Today we're going to look at a Flat Earther.  that kind of confuses me because alongside ranty Flat Earth he provides more evidence for a globe than anything else.  But I guess that's the thing, isn't it?  No matter how much evidence you give a flat earther, or how much evidence they dig up themselves, they seem incapable of admitting that they've been wrong.  This flat earther, well, he believes in gravity.  He proved that the Earth spins on its axis.  He can explain the function of an accelerometer.  But still, somehow, says the Earth is flat.  I weep for humanity.  This is episode 24 of Flirfs or Idiots, and it's for Bob Super Noodle Doodle.  We're living on a disk, floating through space with a tiny sun.  So Bob's Super Noodle Doodle, leader of FECore and probably the most hated man in the YouTube flat earth community.  Because he and his group of researchers publicly proved the earth spins.  Let's have a listen to what he said. ",

And if the gyroscope is mounted anywhere on earth, it's going to drift.  In today's 21st century navigation systems, they're using what's called a ring laser gyroscope.  It is extremely precise.  If we could simply get one of these ring laser gyroscopes, we would be able to prove once and for all that there is no rotation to the Earth.  One of the people in the community actually purchased one for $20,000.  But what we found is, is when we turned on that gyroscope, we found that we were picking up a drift.

You can't find your triangle calculator?  I really don't care.  Now, I'm going to explain... What is it, Mr.  Truth?  You miss Miss Steer.  Well, trust me, she didn't know who you were.  Now, we're going to learn how a fibre optic gyro works.  So a fibre optic gyro has a coil of fibre, and when you input light, half the light goes clockwise and half goes anti-clockwise.  If the gyro isn't moving, you're fine.  But if the gyro rotates, one path the light travels along becomes shorter, and when the light recombines, you register an interference pattern.  It's simple and conclusively proves the Earth spins.  Now go away and leave me alone.  Now, Bob hasn't only handily proved rotation. ",
