And this particular soldier's like, hey, Sarn, I'm going to fuck that dude's dick off.  I'm like, damn it!  Damn, get a video.  I want to see that.  She goes, I had a few beers, Sarn, so forget I said it.  I'm like, never.  Never.  That's exactly what she told me.  And I was like, have at it.  Just show me the video.  Man, respect.  Here you go.  Here's a condom, man.  And so I'm like, well, have at it.  Take a video.  And we never had this conversation.  I'm going home.  I'm going to fuck that guy's dick off.  I'm going to fuck that guy's dick off.  I'm like, oh my god.  I'm in a bar.  I'm drinking.  And my soldiers are telling me they're going to fuck people's dicks off.  I need to leave before I wind up an investigation.  And you know what, this particular female, like we would just be dudes.  And she'd be laughing.  In the beginning, they fucked with her and she kind of got upset.  And I pulled her aside and said, listen, these are all dudes, right?  And they're fucking with you, right?  Now, the way to survive it is you roll with the punches and you fuck with them back.  Because the minute you fuck with them back, they'll be like... All right.  Cool.  And then you're accepted and you're in.  Yeah.  And then you have like a whole platoon of big brothers.  And no matter what happens, they will fucking, they will fight God for you.  They will take a fucking bullet for you.  Yeah.  They'll do it for anyone.  Yeah.  But you'll be like, what are you doing?  I can't tell him any times.  Like, she'll be at the bar and like eight guys are like, what's going on?  What are you doing?  Are you cool with this?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  We'll be over here if you need us.  No, I'm serious.  That's how it went off.  She's like, oh, no, he's cool.  They're like, all right, well, we'll be at the end of the bar.  If you have a problem, let us know.  And we'll kill him!  And I was just like, dude, I need to get out of here.  No, no, like, literally, this is a true story.  The same woman.  We're doing the machine garage, and I always love to sit in the bunker.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck that shit.  I'll shoot that shit.  And she's having a hard time.  And I'm like, what are you doing?  I can't do it.  I go, what?  And I'm like, what are you doing?  well i can't fucking pull it back.  i'm like.  i look at the picture and i'm like.  so you think you should only pull it back with your fucker. ",

I remember I had that.  We're in the hallway.  Because the whole 50, when you put it together, weighs 128 pounds.  I'm like, pick that gun up and move it.  She's like, I can't, sir.  I'm like, why the fuck can't you?  I weigh 110.  All right, take it apart then.  Drag it.  How are you going to argue with that?  At the end, I'm a rational man.  And I'm like, 110, 128.

Back in 2008, before I got on full-time as the AGR, I was doing a long tour, a six-month tour with a recruiting office in St.  Clair Shores.  So I'm up there.  I'm doing the deal.  I sell who?  I was selling Ranger.  I was selling Special Forces and Airborne.  I find out that one of the recruiters is banging these young chicks before they come in.  I'm like, I am fucking furious.  So literally, I'm out behind the recruiting office.  He comes out to go home at the end of the day, and I'm like, hey, we're going to have a little discussion.  What?  I'm like, take off your hat.  Why?  Because I'm going to kick your ass.  What?  What?  What's going on, Sergeant?  I'm like, listen, you're fucking these young chicks.  They don't know fucking better.  They're looking at you.  They're all starry-eyed, and you're taking advantage of that.  That's fucked up.  Well, you know, they're not technically.  I'm like, put your hands up.  And I beat his fucking ass.  Beat his ass.  I punched him in the face like six times, kicked him on the ground a couple times, stepped on his balls.  And then he, like, runs to his car and drives home.  And I get a call from the Sergeant Major.  Yeah.  Sergeant Major's like, Sergeant Bob, why the hell did you beat the shit out of such and such?  I'm like, Sergeant Major, because he's fucking young troops before they come in the Army.  He's like, what?  I'm like, yeah.  You know what?  You want me to file formal charges and fuck people's careers up and you'll get fucking hammered for it because it happened on your watch?  Or you just want to let me fucking step on his balls and beat his ass?  He's like, well, Sergeant Pop, you have a very solid argument.  We're going to take care of this.  And they fucked him up.  Oh, I bet.  They fucked him up, but they did it in a way so nobody else got hammered.  Because it's unfair when you've got one stupid asshole doing stupid shit, and then six people above him get fucked up because he's a dumbass.  No.  He never came back after that.  Sergeant Major called him at home and said, don't come in.  We're going to reassign you, and then you might get fucking kicked out of the Army for this. ",
