            "text": "I'm Annabel, I identify as female, I work anything I can to make a living, but I think of myself more as an artist than anything else.  I've spent a lifetime swinging backwards and forwards to what I perceive to be female behaviour and to extreme male behaviour.  And I toyed with the idea in the 80s and the 90s.  I hadn't done anything about it.  I think the key moment was when my identical twin became ill with cancer.  And he said, look, you've got to be yourself.  Otherwise, you're going to drive yourself insane.  Which was quite a revelation at the time, because he was always... ambiguous about me.  It wasn't the fact that he was anti-trans, he knew trans people, it was the fact that when he saw me it was like seeing himself and that sort of psychologically threw him.  I think the major issue in my own life I've been finding ways to cope with being trans all those years.  Especially when I was younger and a different age, you felt like it was perverse and you were doing something wrong.  And that's not right.  It's not right at all.  What has kept me sane throughout my life is my art.  And that has been important to me.  It's provided an avenue, almost a therapy.  My interaction with healthcare professionals have been very, very mixed.  My biggest complaint is the different methods of referral.  For example, one person was referred to an endocrinologist and got prescribed hormones fairly quickly.  Another person I know had a GP, prescribed hormones.  I had to wait, and so I got to Chynecross Gender Identity Clinic which was quite a long time to wait, because I had to see two independent psychiatrists within Wales before they would consider even referring me, and then I waited 12 months.  to get my first appointment at Charing Cross.  When I was finally diagnosed as gender dysphoric and they could see I was serious and had all this medication prescribed.  If you understand NHS Wales, because there's no trans services in Wales, they have to contract the job out, so to speak, to Charing Cross in London, the gender identity clinic.  And I came back with all this medication I was supposed to be having.  I went to see my GP and he turned around and said, oh, you've got to pay for this.  I said, pardon, do you realise that I'm gender dysphoric and I need this medication?  and now you're telling me I've got to pay for this?  Like, it's a choice I've made.  It's not a choice, it's something.  if I don't do it, it's going to drive me insane.  Fortunately, it was a group practice, so I just went in and saw another GP and then he looked at the stuff, looked at my history and said, well, no, that's absolute nonsense.  And I've heard a lot of stories about GPs being obstructive or not helpful or not understanding.  I find not necessarily obstruction, but a lack of understanding and a lack of urgency.  It's like you're not physically unwell, so you can wait, you know.  Once you've paid rent and bills and financial commitments and you're on a minimum wage, to actually try and transition takes some doing, you know.  The time I realised that if I didn't transition then something serious would happen to me and my moods were becoming blacker and blacker and blacker.  I saw a light at the end of the tunnel in being able to transition.  so I'd waited a long time to actually come to that decision and then when I actually came to the decision and wanted to do something about it then I'm waiting longer still to make my experience more positive and more effective.  it would be nice to be listened to straight away and taken seriously straight away and I can understand there's a need for evaluation and there's a need for assessments but my god it needs to happen a lot quicker than it is because the longer it takes the more it's like you're on tenterhooks.  you're waiting on this edge to actually validate yourself.  It's like your whole life is on hold.  It would be unrealistic to expect every GP to know the ins and outs of trans care and trans issues.  But what they need to do is listen to you and take it seriously. ",
