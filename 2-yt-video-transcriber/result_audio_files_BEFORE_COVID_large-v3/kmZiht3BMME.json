            "text": "It never fails to surprise me how much leftists will use the same arguments over and over and over again without really learning from their mistakes.  If someone has figured out you're lying and you proceed to lie the same exact way, then they will just simply stop listening to you.  Of course, the people who are the sycophants, the people who will agree with you no matter what, are going to keep parroting your opinion and cheering you on But all the people who are in the middle, all the people you actually need to convince are going to stop listening to you.  Which brings me to this article called, Who is the most affected by student debt?  Women.  This article points out that student debt has reached $1.5 trillion in America, and women hold 66% of that.  Why, you ask?  Well, it certainly could not be personal decisions.  It has to be the patriarchy that's responsible.  It has to be the wage gap.  You know, the same wage gap that under investigations because women complained that they weren't getting paid enough, Google and the BBC and their own companies ended up finding that men were actually the ones being underpaid for how much work they did with their job title.  After talking about the $1.5 trillion in debt, the article goes on to say that No shit.  In addition, the AAUW discovered that women have a harder time paying off their student loans than men.  The latter is due largely to the gender pay gap, which, despite the Equal Pay Act, by the way, which was done in the 1970s, it's been illegal to pay women less than men, yet they still promote this bullshit.  The Equal Pay Act is fueled by status quo economics and unchecked market that reproduces the structural inequalities it claims to erase.  In other words, women are paid less than men for the same amount and type of work simply for being a woman instead of a man.  If the women who read this kind of crap actually had some perspective, they would see this as quite insulting to their intelligence because women By making a statement like that, in other words, women are paid less than men for the same type of work, is just saying that you don't understand economics, and you don't understand that when you take sick days for your period, or you go off work early to go see your kids' baseball practice, that you're not working as much or as hard, and the man who doesn't do those things is going to get paid more than you because they worked more than you, even though they have the same job title.  And just because you have the same job title doesn't mean you have the same skill.  And it turns out when you take 25 personal days a year, that somebody who is not taking those personal days might be a little bit better at the job than you.  I find the next paragraph hilarious.  It says, With no end in sight, my student debt will hold me back from savings, investing, buying a home, and contributing to local nonprofits for 15 more years, said Katie.  I find this funny because based on what this article says, Katie is not qualified to be making any investments because she has already made an investment.  She made an investment in her education and look what she got out of it.  She got out 15 years of debt and possibly a degree that's either entirely worthless or a degree that is not necessary for the job that she wants.  I mean, it still baffles me that people get degrees in things like writing, coding, business, political science, all jobs that don't require a degree.  And not only that, but college typically does not practice actual use of the skill.  They just practice theory.  So not only will you have wasted your time getting those degrees, but you'll not actually know how to use that degree at all.  For example, I have a degree in kinesiology, which is exercise science.  I graduate a three-year program for kinesiology with zero knowledge of how to do any exercises based on the program.  I knew all the theory behind the exercise, but when it came to the actual exercises, I knew nothing.  In fact, I went on an interview right before I graduated to be a personal trainer at a very, very high quality gym.  When I got tested by the manager, because every single fitness job you get, they'll test you.  When I got tested by the manager to see if I actually knew what I was talking about, he had me do a couple exercises, one of them being the lat pulldown, and I sat on the machine backwards.  The lat pulldown, an extremely common exercise in a workout routine, And I did it incorrectly after three years of fitness education.  And not only three years of fitness education, but I had taken a full semester of weight training, and I didn't know one of the most commonly done exercises.  Well, that's because when I took my weight training class, the teacher didn't teach us anything.  All she did was say, go and work out, and she would proceed to eat her food and text on her phone the entire hour that we were required to show up.  Almost all the useful things that I learned about exercise science were learned outside of school, and all of the material covered in my major can be learned entirely on the internet for free with YouTube channels like the Khan Academy.  In fact, the teaching at my school was so inefficient and so terrible that I would often have to supplement with YouTube videos to actually pass my classes.  And I could stare at a picture of a heart for three hours and try to memorize all the parts of a heart, or I can go and watch a YouTube video that is 10 minutes about the heart, watch it three times, and have everything basically memorized for that time period.  So let's do some calculations.  When I took anatomy, I had to go to school early, which means I sat in traffic for about an hour and a half both ways.  I had to sit in an hour and a half class in a four-hour lab.  So I spent eight hours twice a week going to school to learn this information, and that doesn't include study time, when I could have just learned it for free in about 30 minutes three times a week.  I have another example of how inefficient school is.  My second year of college, I took a Japanese calligraphy class because when you learn to read in Japanese, it is very, very difficult and very time consuming, and you have to memorize about either somewhere between 1,500 to 2,000 characters.  So I took a calligraphy class which lasted about four months, an entire semester, and we went over about 100 of those characters.  Outside of school, using an app on my cell phone called Kanji Study, which is probably the most useful tool for learning how to read in Japanese ever created.  But outside of school with that app, I can learn 200 kanji in about a month and a half versus the 100 kanji I learned in a four month period.  Now that class I took on Japanese writing was a few hundred dollars.  Kanji study is $10.  You don't need school.  You can learn all this shit on your own in less time for free and with better teachers.  because when you learn from the internet or when you learn on your own, you have complete choice over who teaches you.  Whereas in college, you often don't have any choice in who teaches you in your major because usually it's just one person teaching all the important classes and oftentimes it's That teacher sucks.  And if you happen to pick a field of study that does not lead you to any job opportunities or career opportunities, then it's not such a life-destroying deal like college is, because college is expensive.  The average student debt is $38,000.  Not only that, college wastes years of your life with general education, with such great classes as communications, cosmology, mythology, Chicano-American studies, and whatever other bullshit they make you take.  that has absolutely nothing to do with your field of study.  So you can go to college, get a useless degree that has wasted four to six years of your life and gotten you almost $40,000 in debt, or you can learn from the internet for free with better teachers and less time used.  But clearly, there is a large portion of the population that is not intelligent enough to see the obvious answer to the problem.  Everybody says they want free education and now it's time and things got to get paid for.  Well, you've had a free internet education for at least the past decade.  But of course, we live in a society with a student debt crisis.  And what's their solution?  Well, come on.  What do you think their solution is?  Most student debt is accrued by women, and what happens when women accrue debt?  Well, the men have to pay for it.  The whipping boy is going to take the punishment for someone else's problem.  This just goes to show you how little women know about economics, or probably how little women care about economics when they say things like this, like free school or student debt forgiveness.  It's not free school because teachers and faculty do not work for free, which means someone is going to have to pay for it.  How do you think they're going to pay for the student loan debt forgiveness?  Because they're not just going to say no one has to pay debt and that's it.  No, the companies that loaned you out that money are still going to get their payday.  And what's going to happen when you give these people guaranteed pay and they're the only ones you can go to?  Well, I know that economics is hard for you leftists to understand, but when you get a monopoly, these services get more expensive and they get crappier.  College is already a waste of time and money now.  I mean, think of how bad it will get if someone like Bernie Sanders wins the presidency and gives everybody free college.  I mean, you guys say it yourself.  We are in government schools for 12 years, and by the time we graduate, we know zero economically viable skills.  Given the same people who wasted 12 years of your life and abused you during that time period, more money is completely idiotic.  You want to solve the student debt crisis without making things worse?  How about instead of providing everybody free school or loan forgiveness, you just allow people who have taken out student loans to go for bankruptcy like you do with every other single form of debt.  That way, there's no debtor's prison or there's no indentured servitude when you take out a student loan, which means all the people who are providing student loans will be a lot more careful about who they provide loans, and they will not provide loans for shitty and useless degrees.  But I guess you can't do that because then college and all those female employees who have nice cushy and easy jobs might have to lose their job or take a pay cut because people are making more responsible decisions with their money.  And this is one of the really powerful MGTOW ideas and you can use it whether you have chosen to be MGTOW or not.  So all you trad cons, listen up because this affects you too.  You cannot save anybody from their own problems.  And when you save people from their own problems, they don't learn and they just repeat the same mistakes over and over and over again.  And this is one of the big ways that women have become weaker over the past few decades is because every time a woman has a problem, somebody solves it for her or some government program solves it for her.  Somebody goes and plays Captain Save-A-Ho.  When you give someone money to solve their problems, they don't learn how to solve the problem, they just learn to ask you for money when there are any problems.  When I was in high school, I played a game called RuneScape, and in that game, I was very, very rich.  This was back when I was a socialist, so I thought that if I just gave a disadvantaged player some money, they would thrive, succeed, and become an expert player like me.  That's not what happened.  When I did this, I gave a new player a million gold on his first day playing the game.  We were friends for a few months while I was playing the game, and during that time, he did not venture out and become the master of his own destiny.  Every single time he had a problem, he would just ask me for more money in the game.  And I decided to stick my hand on the hot stove two more times with different players, and both those players did the same thing.  They didn't become good players.  All they did was ask for more money.  I effectively made them worse at the game by doing that.  When you feed the wild animals, they get lazy and they stop hunting for themselves.  And that's basically what they have been asking us to do.  One of MGTOW's most powerful messages for all men whether you are a MGTOW or not, is stop giving women money.  Stop participating in these wealth transfers.  They are not for you.  Welfare is not for you.  Free school is not for you.  The minimum wage hikes are not for you.  They are for women.  And if you're willing to do those things politically, then that means you are doing those things personally.  How many women have men wrapped around their fingers paying for absolutely everything that they need?  Oh, I ran out of money and I can't pay my cell phone bill now.  Can you loan me 60 bucks and I'll pay you back at my next paycheck?  Meanwhile, she doesn't pay you back.  Are you paying for her car?  Are you paying for her food?  Are you paying for her clothes?  Are you paying her rents?  I mean, it's 2019.  It's current year.  Women are working now and they can pay their own bills.  And so if you are paying her bills and she is doing nothing for you in return outside of going on days with you, then you are a simp and you are only making the problem worse.  You are making your life worse because you're wasting your money and you're making her life worse because you are robbing her of the ability to answer for her mistakes.  And the only way women will ever answer for their mistakes and start solving their own problems is if men stop doing everything for them.  So you wasted a bunch of years of your youth in college getting a useless degree and now you're in a bunch of debt?  Too bad.  Deal with it yourself.  But none of that happens when men sit there and play Captain Sabaho.  And well, I think I will leave it at that for this video.  So if you liked it, hit the like button.  Subscribe if you're new.
