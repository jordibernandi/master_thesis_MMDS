            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to the show.  Today we're going to be discussing a tale of fame, fortune, lies, and child exploitation.

So the story of Danielle Cohn is one that's become pretty popular among certain spheres of the internet, but if you're not familiar with it yet, don't worry, we're gonna be going through some history.  Danielle Cohn is a singer, and I use that term very loosely, Instagram influencer and YouTuber who came onto the scene around two years ago.  In 2017, she released a song called Marilyn Monroe with an accompanying music video that was very reminiscent of Rebecca Black's infamous Friday in both quality and overall tone.  It was really pretty bad, but at the same time, it wasn't all too different from the usual teeny bopper stuff that you might see on Disney or Nickelodeon.  See what I mean?  Yet despite the objective badness, or heck maybe even because of it, Danielle gained a substantial online following, amassing millions of followers across different platforms.  Specifically, Marilyn Monroe really gave birth to her YouTube career.  On her channel, where she also posted the music video to Marilyn Monroe, she put up exactly the kinds of videos that one would expect from a preteen with a YouTube channel.  Song covers, best friend tags, going through old photos, the huge.  Looking back at it, it wasn't until she posted her next two music videos that things started to get a little strange.  You can go shade on December, you can put the blame on May.  You can go and say what you wanna, can be like a hurricane.  Let him yell, no he ain't gonna take any else.  At the time, Danielle and her mom said that she was 13, and I don't know about you guys, and I don't mean to sound judgmental, but in my opinion, 13-year-olds in crop tops... Not the best look.  So that was kinda weird, but overall, grand scheme of things, a 13-year-old in a crop top is not the worst or most inappropriate thing I've ever seen.  However, it is from this point on that things started to escalate pretty quickly.  her YouTube videos started taking on more mature themes.  She did a Touch My Body challenge with her boyfriend, she would post reaction videos of people literally just reacting to her dressing up in revealing outfits, and on her Instagram account, the clothes she'd pose in would either be super skimpy or just a straight-up bikini.  And I'm not necessarily saying that a 14 year old should never be caught wearing a bikini, but there is a difference between your average sports bikini and a bikini that's clearly been designed to show off the goods.  Not to mention, in addition to the clothing that she was wearing, there were also the poses and angles that she was being photographed in which just did not scream age appropriate.  And just where are this girl's parents in all of this, you might be wondering.  Well, in her mother's case at least, the answer is right beside her.  Not only does Danielle's mother, Jennifer Archambault, appear in videos with her daughter, but she also acts as Danielle's manager.  Hey honey, why don't you and your little boyfriend over there post a video of yourselves titled, Our First Time Together?  That's sure to get tons of clicks.  So this brings us all the way through 2018, and at this point, I think it's fair to say that Danielle was already very sexualized, but 2019.  2019, I feel, is where she really just let loose.  We're talking boobs out, butt out, as is illustrated in the music video for her song, No Way.  So, terrible music quality aside, because somehow things have managed to get worse.  We're just exploring whole new levels of unlistenable here.  People were kind of concerned about Danielle's situation before, but this... This is really when people started to freak out because, I mean, you'd be hard-pressed to find literally anyone out there that would believe that that was an appropriate thing for a 15 year old to appear in.  And to match her sexy new music videos, her Instagram posts got a lot more provocative as well.  And this is where things get really worrying because as wrong as it would be for a 15-year-old to be this sexualized, the videos, the Instagram posts, all of this is even more concerning when you consider the fact that there is good reason to believe that Danielle is not actually 15 like her and her mother claim, but in fact 13 years old.  Earlier this year, a birth certificate leaked.  allegedly by Danielle's father, showing a birth year not of 2004, like had previously been stated, but 2006, meaning that Danielle would have just turned 13 in 2019.  Danielle and her mother have both denied the birth certificate's validity, but around the same time, People discovered a video that had been posted in 2012 by a user named Jennifer Archambault featuring a little girl who looks very much like a young Danielle with the description, my little six-year-old daughter singing.  If that little girl in the video really is Danielle and she was six in 2012, that would mean that now in 2019, she would be 13.  And to make things even more suspicious, the father of her boyfriend at the time who was turning 17 posted this to his social media account just before the two of them broke up.  He said, quote, I love my son very much.  All I want is for him to be safe with himself and his decision.  As parents, we need to protect him from any harm that might come his way.  He wants to be emancipated and I understand that, but his emancipation could give him prison time.  Danny is not 15.  And I just want to say here that even though they're famous, Danielle and her family and her boyfriend and his family, they all still absolutely deserve privacy.  However, when it comes to the issue of Danielle's age, When it comes to the possibility that Danielle is a 13 year old who is being sexually exploited and so publicly, then yeah, that is everyone's business because if that is true, then this is child abuse.  Despite the growing evidence that Danielle is in fact 13, her mother has continued to allow, and if you ask me, probably even encouraged Danielle to keep posting grossly inappropriate photos of herself on Instagram.  And as far as her YouTube videos go, I've seen Britney Spears music videos that were less sexualized than this crap.  Even if she were actually 15, This would all still be really gross.  Heck, it would even be much if she were an adult.  I mean, you don't always need to be half naked, but the idea that she's 13, that is disgusting.  And what makes me so mad is that not only is Danielle's mother allowing her daughter to be exploited like this, but she's actually taking part in the exploitation herself.  And you know who else shares the blame in this exploitation?  The social media platforms.  Instagram, for example, in their community guidelines states that, quote, Even when this content is shared with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways.  Tons of people have been reporting Danielle's posts for breaking the community guideline against partially new children, which is a good guideline to have, but the posts are still up.  Why?  Well, it has been estimated that Danielle may be worth as much as two and a half million dollars, so I guess that's two and a half million reasons to keep her posts up.  And YouTube.  My interview with Tommy Robinson gets put on restricted mode for hate speech.  Soph gets banned off of the platform entirely, but 13-year-old Danielle dressing up in slutty Halloween costumes for her boyfriend?  Totally fine.  These companies don't do anything because this girl has millions of followers, gets millions of views, and makes them a ton of money.  And that's not even to mention brands like Fashion Nova, which is a major online retailer that has actually sponsored posts of Danielle wearing the revealing clothing that they sent her.  Best case scenario, you're sexualizing a 15-year-old to sell your product.  Worst case scenario, you're sexualizing a 13-year-old to sell your product.  How could your marketing department possibly think that's okay?  Were there no adult thoughts to send your product to?  And random internet strangers like me and all of the other people who have made videos or comments about this aren't the only ones who are worried about Danielle here, because as it turns out, so is her father.  Earlier this month, Danielle's father posted a very long Facebook post condemning Danielle's exploitation and detailing everything he's tried to do behind the scenes to rectify and gain control of the situation.  In his post, Danielle's father wrote, Danielle is 13.  I have never liked Danielle being on social media, especially when she started at such a young age.  But pageants and modeling and then music were all pushed on her.  It was always a huge problem to me.  I asked for it to stop immediately, which it didn't.  We found Pinterest boards with her photos and I told her mom I was worried about pedophiles.  We tried to take measures to stop it, but it didn't stop.  The pictures now have gotten worse and worse.  I am finally saying something on social media because people need to be held accountable.  Despite my feelings, I allowed Danielle to move to California if this made her happy, with the agreement that she would visit once a month, send school records, and be appropriate.  If I found something inappropriate, they would take it down.  It started with crop tops to bikinis and now lingerie.  Instead of it being taken down, now every time I ask, I'm told Danielle wants to post it, even when she was 11, and I'm told she's losing likes.  To me, safety is more important.  Instagram, YouTube, Fashion Nova, Buzzfeed, Universal, Target, Bang Energy Drinks, and the state of California are okay with child exploitation, obviously.  They have no issues using my daughter for clicks, a minor, someone who just turned 13.  I have contacted Instagram and YouTube and they both ignored me while they made money off exploiting my daughter.  I contacted the child labor board in California who told us her birthdate was wrong and then hurried off the phone.  I have never once given my approval for Danielle to do any ads or promotions or shows and if you have something saying I did, it was fake.  Please don't call me asking if I authorized her to work.  I haven't and will not, period.  She is a child and should not have been working from such a young age.  Yes, I have a custody agreement where my daughter is supposed to see me every month for a week, but her mother only sends her when she feels like it, makes it difficult, and I go months without a call or seeing her.  She wasn't even allowed to attend my wedding.  When she is here, she gets constant calls to do this or that ad, and I worry if she's actually enjoying life.  She was pulled out of school for online school without my knowledge at first.  When I called the police, I also stated I was worried she was dating much older boys.  Instead of checking, they sent police for a welfare check.  A police officer called me to tell me he felt sorry that things weren't right at the house, but they could do nothing for me.  I have a parental agreement which says I should be contacted about any job Danielle has to ensure it's age appropriate.  I have never been contacted once.  When I've asked to be in contact with her manager, it never happens.  Once again, I spent 20 grand to get half custody that I deserved years ago.  for no one to care about making sure it gets followed unless I spend thousands again to fight it.  How is it fair that because I am a father, the system screws  us?\".  The post is much longer than that and he goes into greater detail about his relationship with Danielle and Danielle's mother, but I'm not gonna read it in its entirety.  Suffice it to say though that Danielle's father does clearly state that she is in fact 13 and that he is not happy with his daughter's social media career.  I think we can all feel how frustrated he is about being powerless to stop his daughter's exploitation that's unfolding in front of the world online.  And clearly Danielle's father is a very private man, which I can absolutely appreciate, but I still just want to say in the off chance that either he or one of his family members or friends is watching this, if you would like to take Danielle's mother to court for not respecting your custody rights that you have as a father, I'm sure there are countless people out there who are also worried about Danielle, who would be more than happy to help you crowdfund the legal fees.  And guys, I think he's right in saying that ultimately, the system has failed Danielle.  She is the biggest victim here.  And I'm gonna be real with you here, I know that it may be hard to sympathize with her with that at least seemingly bratty attitude and the over-sexualized persona, but please try to remember that she is a child.  She just turned 13 this year.  Her entire persona is the result of bad parenting and a society that is so happy to see boobs and butt that apparently we don't even care that they may be on a minor.  I don't want to live in a culture that is okay with profiting off of a sexually exploited 13-year-old.  So if you want this to stop, then please let YouTube know what's going on.  Let Instagram know what's going on.  Write to brands like Fashion Nova that are making money off of her and tell them what they're doing is wrong.  And if you're subscribed to her on YouTube or you follow her on Instagram, please stop.  Her and her mother thrive off of that attention, even if it's negative attention.  It just encourages them to make more content like this.  That's pretty much all I have to say about the situation, but as always, I would love to know what you guys think.  What can Danielle's father do to regain control of the situation and, as the audience, What can we do to help stop this exploitation?  Let me know, but that's it for now.  Thank you guys so much for tuning in, and I'll see you next time. ",
