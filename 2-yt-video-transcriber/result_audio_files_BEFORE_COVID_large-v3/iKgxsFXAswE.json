            "text": "So much Dave Rubin drama.  Let's start off with the Milo Yiannopoulos thing.  Milo Snuffleupagus.  Yolo Minneapolis.  However you pronounce his name.  So I guess Milo, he just spilling the tea, dude.  Milo fucking, he a wreck.  Milo's life is not going very well.  People have abandoned him.  Money's drying up.  Popularity's drying up.  Everybody hates on him.  And he ain't taking it well.  So the other day, I guess Dave Rubin watched his interview with Jordan Peterson, and he messaged Milo, and he's like, hey, Milo, saw your interview.  And I guess he's trying to get Milo to come on his show because Dave Rubin only has the same people on his show over and over again because it's \u2013 It's an echo chamber.  That's what Dave Rubin's built for himself, even though they claim the exact opposite.  That's exactly what it is.  It's nothing but an echo chamber.  So I guess he was trying to invite Milo on his show, and Milo released the DMs showing exactly what he said to him, and this is the DMs.  Dave Rubin's like, this still your normer?  Milo's like, what do you want?  Dave Rubin's like, your interview with JP was good, that's all.  Milo's like, I was nothing but loyal, helpful, and supportive to you since the day we met, but you threw me to the wolves and did nothing to defend me when they came for me over total bullshit.  Then you had the chutzpah to publicly gloat about my irrelevance.  So why are you texting me now?  Feeling the heat, are we?  They're coming for you.  I won't waste energy trying to sabotage or harm you, but I sure am going to savor the spectacle.  Go to hell, Dave.  And I'm like, ooh, this is some juicy shit right here.  Oh, my God.  Milo a little bit emotional, isn't he?  And then Dave Rubin's like, I'm not even sure what you're talking about.  I watched the interview this weekend and thought it was excellent.  That's all.  Okay, then.  And Milo's like, bye, Dave.  You deserve every bit of what's coming your way.  Ooh, man, that's some bitterness right there, isn't it?  Oh, yeah, this is another thing Milo said since we're on Milo.  Talking about Dave Rubin.  Milo.  What Down Syndrome Dave hasn't figured out yet is that everyone fucking despises him and will drop him like a stone the first second they can.  Peterson, despite my theological reservations about him, has talent, charisma, and an intellect worth engaging with.  Dave has nothing.  When his social media accounts are taken away, he will never be heard of again.  Goodness, won't that be sad.  So, damn.  Fucking salty, salty as shit, isn't it?  But anyway, yeah, that's entertaining as fuck.  I don't like Milo, but that is some fucking tea if I ever saw it.  Spilling the tea, spilling the tea.  If it wasn't Milo, I would almost feel sorry for him because clearly he feels like he's been abandoned by people.  you know, left out to rot.  But at the same time, this is Milo, somebody who built his entire career on trying to out transgender people in order to publicly humiliate them for the sole purpose of upsetting people so that they would boycott him and then he could play the victim card like he was this big free speech warrior who SJWs were trying to silence, which was his entire grift from the very fucking beginning.  So it's really hard to feel too sorry for him.  But at the same time, my God, what a mess that dude is.  So sad.  So sad, Milo. ",
