There's like a few different things I kind of wanted to go over, but one of them that's like really been on my mind is like, so throughout high school, you definitely get this sense of, because I was especially, you know, into the whole Dave Rubin, like NTSJW, I was like, told myself I leaned left or whatever.  And I was like a true liberal or whatever.  But a big thing that I was really curious about going up to college was the left bias that that a lot of like the right and especially like the intellectual dark web and all them talk about.  And obviously, I don't I mean, I haven't I don't know exactly like specific data on this, but if I were to assume, I would assume that most professors do lean left, and I would assume that this does, um, you know, possibly play a role into their teachings.  Um, and the only reason why I specified the fact that I'm in California is because like, I don't want to generalize my experience to the, um, the, you know, the broad range of all universities, especially like fucking private Christian universities and all that shit.  But, um, I've definitely noticed here, I've, you know, I've not had one professor aside from a communications professor who wasn't left leaning and it wasn't, you know, relatively relatively obvious in their teachings.  not to say that nothing that they taught was untrue.  but um i just kind of wanted to know your thoughts on it whether or not you thought it was a problem.  because in a sense it's like okay i do like the fact that um you know i feel like the left is just more engaged in academia in general.  so you know of course um left-wing ideas are going to be brought about uh throughout.  you know a college campus where like academia is where it's at but But at the same time, it's like, you know, I don't necessarily to become a sort of effective indoctrination machine.  I don't.  What do you think? ",

I genuinely feel as though reactionary beliefs and one thing I want to do after I graduate is go to grad school for political theory and um.  something that i've just really noticed is how throughout the years um like you're you're absolutely right conservatism and like reactionary beliefs are just so anti-academia.  and science you know it's like and it's always about this narrative of show the other side of science exactly show the other side.  you know where's the other side about evolution and then you know now it's about climate change.  and now that we're discovering new things about the social sciences it's like conservatives today probably don't like acknowledge any real social science like other than fake bullshit or even science or they'll say like psychology is a social science now and isn't a real science?  right yeah right right right and um.  and it's a problem because we need to start treating social science um obviously it's a lot harder to measure um in the same way like political studies and like other social science studies as we can, like with, you know, biology or physics.  But I think especially, you know, I know you and I both agree, particularly with a more determinist materialist perspective on like how humans behave and cause effect relationships.  And I think it's important to start viewing social sciences through this lens.  And it's really it's really annoying, particularly even when I'm talking to other to other people who are on the left but don't um have a background or even really understand uh the social science i i'll describe to them like.  oh you know like.  these are the reasons why why we're having like an insurgence or like maybe this is a possible possible reasons why we got trump and they'll almost like take my reasons as like justifications or like or even or even when i you know you describe like any sort of like terrorist attacks.  these are you know the reasons or the or the preconditions that like led somebody to do this.  and it's like i'm not.  i'm not giving the normative statement that these things are good but like but yeah.

So the problem is, at least within the first two trimesters, especially is you there's no you being a fetus and not wanting to be aborted because there is no you because you are essentially your consciousness and there's no consciousness in a fetus so it is like incapable of having wants or desires or anything like that.  so you don't technically like the the material makeup in which that makes your body.  now as part of parts of it may have existed, but you as a conscious, um, being, you didn't come into existence until about the third trimester.  So that, that's essentially what I would say is, um, the only, like from, from why I think it makes more logical sense to, um, if, if you want to value, um, like the respect, the desires of others, uh, it would only make sense to respect things that are even capable of having desires.  Cause it's not, It's not like something to be a first trimester fetus, but it is like something to be a third trimester.  You understand what I'm saying? ",

And the only thing I can say to that, I mean, well, the thing is, is I'd say that, first of all, in somebody who's in a coma, I'm not sure if their sentience dies completely.  I think that I'm not.  I'm not necessarily, I guess, equipped enough with the evidence to know whether or not.  And I don't know if we are as a society to know whether or not they are still having conscious thoughts or like being a sleeping person.  But I don't think you necessarily lose sentience.  And obviously where you can tell where I'm coming from this, I'm someone.  that's where where i come from.  i care about sentience i'm like a vegan and all that shit.  but um i uh so to that i although someone is i guess when when we say unconscious when someone's sleeping i don't necessarily know if that means that they're no longer that they're insentient or incapable of they're still they're still having thoughts.  they're just not i don't know they're just not in a different state of mind i guess.  and so like when you go into a coma in which you may wake up or you're asleep, it's not necessarily you lose sentience.  And that's where I felt Ben Shapiro.  I, I was, he was like, cause I was like, Oh, sentience is what like makes me, he was like, okay.  So he's like, what about you when you're asleep?  And I was like, I don't think you lose sentience.  And then he was like, what about when you're in a coma? ",

Because like, so like, I feel like a good argument that you could use against me, this is one that I've kind of thought of over the past couple hours.  A good argument you could use against me is I'm not really concerned with what happens with dead people.  Because once you're dead, you're dead, right?  Your mind doesn't exist anymore.  You're not capable of conceiving of any consequences that happen.  So if you want to fuck my body or whatever, it's whatever.  So, like, what is the difference, what is the material difference between, like, a dead person and then, like, something that hasn't yet developed, like, a conscious, so, like, a child or whatever?  Which, and I guess you could kind of point to that, so, like, well, so, like, a child isn't capable of conceiving, like, anything in regards to it.  So, like, killing a child is the same thing as, like, when I say child, I mean, like, a fetus.  we'll say something before six months old.  killing a child is the equivalent to like killing a feet.  uh killing a corpse like you can't really do it.  but then i guess um yeah but then i run into things where it's like.  i think that the sleeping thing is legitimate.  and maybe maybe that's true.  like you know if you kill somebody that's sleeping like the person really doesn't know and then they die.  so it's whatever afterwards right?  yeah i'm not sure i don't know.
