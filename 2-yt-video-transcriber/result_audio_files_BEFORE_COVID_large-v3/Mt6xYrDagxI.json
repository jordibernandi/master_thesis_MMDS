Unfortunately, when he got it, it proved that the Earth was rotating and then he admitted it on a documentary on Netflix called Behind the Curve.  I think that's about it.  It's brilliant.  Hokey Coakley has gone on the show to tell him that he was an idiot for ever thinking gyroscopes could prove anything, because a gyroscope is just a measuring tool.
