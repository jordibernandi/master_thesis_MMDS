            "text": "Out here with Rogue Nation today.  Nassau County.  This is like a little cluster of everything.  Got a courthouse.  You've got a juvie and a sheriff's office.  All kinds of different areas.  Go out here and.  Oh, we have some of that machinery here that is used for.  You know what?  That civil processing and communications.  Got a door left open here.  I don't know if that's.  Supposed to be like that.  I guess it could be as it's all locked within there.  We got the mobile command or the mobile communication here.  Looks like a. Concert.  like roadies would pick this up and put in the truck.  I don't know what they got in there, but that's a nice ladder, satellite dish on top.  I bet this thing's worth 300,000.  I would imagine anyway.  What is that thing pointing to?  Nothing over there.  I don't know.  Maybe they got a slow... I don't know what that is.  So it looks like emergency management.  These guys over here doing some work.  Got them.  And then over there, that's more jail area, jail facility, as you can see.  Emergency management.  And what these guys do, if you've never been in EOC, I've done that, worked in EOC, when hurricanes or fires or anything like that, they stage people here at this location with pretty much every city in the county.  So if there's little subcities in here in Nassau County, they'll put representatives from each one, and that way you have a direct line and there's no lapse in communication, they say.  That's the end.  They got their mail containers over there.  That's where they get the mails.  And EOC.  Oh, that's crazy.  So here we go.  Here's their weather, stuff like that.  again this is uh their primary is is hurricanes.  and in florida you get hurricanes.  what every every year usually in case you guys wanting that hello.  hi there i was gonna see about.  um a quick public workers request that you might be able to answer and it's how many employees you guys have?  the eoc itself?  Six?  Okay, there we go.  Thank you so much.  Two part-time, four full-time.  Say again?  Two part-time and four full-time.  And then you just don't hope for hurricanes, or you do because that's job security.  All right.  More than hurricanes, that's funny.  Yeah, because you guys have a lot of wooded area up here too, so you get heavy fires and... One day we had seven fires going at one time.  Wow.  And like in some of the other counties, in Nassau County, there's probably hundreds of cities, not hundreds, but probably 20 or 30 different small cities... In Nassau?  No.  No, it's just the county?  Are you with the other guy walking around with a camera?  Yeah, yeah.  What are you guys doing?  We're just doing documentation, touring everything, and doing news articles about EOC and some of the other buildings here.  So that's why my questions are kind of innocent.  They're not like peering or anything like that.  But yeah, I was in Nassau.  Like a representative from each of the small cities will come in here to EOC and have like a cluster of people so that you can have the communication right here.  Is that how that works here?  This is a communications center, and the sheriff's office, the health department, fire, police, they all have spots in here for any incident.  Yep, that's right.  So that way, if there's one communication spot, and it's like, hey, whatever city you got this, or hey, fire, you guys got this going on over here, all right, we need to send rescue this, and there's no delay in communications for emergencies.  That's probably what it's for.  I think, yeah.  Dispatch tells them where the fire is.  If it's a fire that got out of hand where we had to activate the EOC, then that would be more like a center point of communication for getting the emergency message out.  Okay, that makes sense.  To avoid this area.  Absolutely.  If there's a hazardous spill, we might coordinate with the Department of Health.  And you guys have reverse 911 here?  Or is that just, okay, yeah, that sounds good.  All right, well, thank you very much for your time.  I appreciate it.  Bye now.  I don't, it's under James Madison Audits if you need to see it.  If you want to write it down, you can.  James Madison Audits?  Yep, that's right.  Like the founding father, James Madison, and then audits, like a tax audit.  Got it.  All right, thank you so much.  Have a good day.  You too.  All right, so there we go.  That's EOC for you.  That's what they do here.  Six employees, two part-time.  For full time, she said, I think.  All right, that sounds great.  So this is such a good place here for them, though, in case they have a centralized emergency, they can have all the communication there.  So who are you guys?  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to have you interrupt me there.  They're Captain, is it Sebs, Lebs?  Slavos.  Slavos.  I thought you interrupted me.  Yeah, I was talking to something, and then you said, and who are you?  Yeah, that's... Yeah, you just come walking out of my facility.  Your facility?  You own this facility?  Yeah.  Okay, so... If you want to pat me down, you can.  I don't have any weapons on me.  I'll lift my shirt and show you I have nothing on me for security.  Well, you said security, like there's some kind of issue.  Can I finish my stuff here?  So EOC is a really good place because what it does is allow you to have... Rude of you to interrupt, Captain.  Yeah, it is.  It sure is.  It sure is.  So what they do, they have a really good program here, but Captain... What is it again?  Slabos?  Not so good.  So anyway, that's what they do.  Centralized EOC.  It helps when emergencies and so on and so forth like that.  Are you talking to you, sir?  Yeah, he was talking to me.  I was doing some stuff here.  Okay, because the gentleman there wouldn't talk to me.  He come walking out filming.  Gentleman was something like that.  It means there's a concern.  Maybe there might be a problem.  Yeah, because 2019.  But I'm being rude because I interrupted him, sir.  Yeah, have a happy new year.  Look at these two.  One needs to eat, the other doesn't.  Let's have a good day.  Thank you guys.  Okay, good.  Then we have no security issues.  Again, if you want to pat me down, feel free.  I got battery pack in here.  That, so we have no security issues.  It's a God-given First Amendment right.  You wonder because you do see signs.  There are signs around here.  Now, granted the lobby isn't, but there are signs that say this is a secure facility, authorized personnel only.  So when that happens, we naturally ask people why they're on the property.  Yeah, it's a public area.  That's why it's on the property.  That is a legitimate question for anybody.  That's correct.  It is a legitimate question.  But when you're talking and interject right in the middle of someone's talking, you call me rude.  That's what I call rude.  I don't know if you're talking to yourself or what you're talking to or what you're doing.  Hey, sir.  My name is Captain Slevos.  I just want to ask you a quick question if you don't mind me interrupting.  That's usually how it goes there.  No, absolutely.  Ask a question.  I don't want to.  I'm being you.  I asked a simple question.  I didn't say you had to stop.  I asked a simple question.  We're stopped now, so it's good.  What was that officer's name over there?  You don't have to tell me that, Captain.  Captain, are you a CLIA accredited?  Just like you don't have to tell me your name.  Wrong.  No, this is not an official function.  It's on his name or on his shirt.  I didn't see it.  I don't have to tell you.  Well, I can't help it if you didn't walk over to read it, but I don't have to tell you.  I can't read, sir.  That's why I'm asking you.  You're a captain.  You probably implement policy.  Are you guys CLIA accredited?  No, I can't implement policy.  Oh, you probably don't sit on a board.  that does it?  No, I can't implement it, no.  Okay, so you don't make... Only the sheriff can implement it.  And as a captain, what do you do then?  I do a lot of things, Brent.  Okay.  All right.  Captain of the boat usually drives a ship.  Anyway, yeah, there's nothing.  I'm not in the Navy.  Say it.  I'm not in the Navy.  I know.  It doesn't look like you're in the Navy.  I don't drive a ship.  All right.  I'm just saying, a captain of the boat, you don't do policy.  You can't do policy.  You don't implement it.  You don't recommend it.  But you have to follow policy.  True.  That's true.  All right.  Well, that's pretty good.  I'm glad it was there.  We were just coming in here, like I said, doing a tour, and the people that set the demeanor are the ones that set the demeanor.  I was in the middle of a conversation with... 13P, suspicious person.  And he said he wouldn't give me your name.  The captain wouldn't give me your name.  Can you give me your name, sir?  My name?  Sure.  It's Kay Clements.  Kay Clements is your rank?  Are you just a deputy?  I'm a deputy.  Deputy?  No captain?  No ranking?  No.  All right.  So we have a captain out here now.  And we have a deputy out here, but they got to call a road unit for a 13P.  13P is suspicious person.  And so we generated a call.  Anyway, as long as we're not detained, I'm going to head out.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good day, sir.  Yeah.  Anyway, that was Nassau County.  EOC people are pretty nice, but Captain Commando with his boots over there, not so much.  Anyway, we're going to head out.  I'm going to finish this one up, let you guys have access to this.  We're going to go check out some of the other locations.  Have a good day.
