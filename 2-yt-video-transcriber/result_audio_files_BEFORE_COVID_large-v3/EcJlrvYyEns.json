So evidence of actual racism is getting harder to find.  Instead, they fall for racial hate hoaxes.  They make them up.  They disseminate them.  They amplify them.  The latest example comes from the state of Georgia.  Late last week, Georgia Democratic lawmaker Erica Thomas said she was told to, quote, go back where you came from at a supermarket checkout. ",

I was raised with a Cuban grandmother that didn't speak any English.  Facebook.  I will make it public.  Proven facts.  All my statements are anti-Trump, anti-Republican, anti-racism, anti-bigotry.
