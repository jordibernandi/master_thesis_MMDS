            "text": "Mr.  Trudeau has, by his own admission, a week before Election Day, failed Canada miserably as Prime Minister.  Well, in total honesty, I added the word miserably.  Here is what he said in Fredericton in answer to a reporter's question about any regrets he may have had after his four years in office thus far.  Quote, everything I tried to do in the last four years has been focused on bringing the country together.  Yet we find ourselves now in a more polarized, more divisive election than even the 2015 one.  End of quotes.  We now have some clarity of thought from Justin Trudeau.  He knows a country is in danger.  And he's now saying that he has tried over four years to bring it together.  But it is not together.  If anything, with the West and Quebec making noise about independence, it is in worse shape than four years ago.  He is failing at the most important job of a Prime Minister of Canada, keeping it unified.  So why do we find ourselves in a more polarized election?  It is in no small part thanks to Trudeau's polarizing words and actions and policies.  He and his party have themselves recklessly sowed division whenever they thought it would suit them.  They're still doing that on the campaign trail right now.  Trudeau does not have the stuff to succeed in anything but burnishing his own celebrity star.  His leadership has been found wanting, even in his own estimation.  And the country is paying for it in a most serious manner.  His policies on energy, taxation, infrastructure, indigenous peoples, even feminism, have proven themselves to be either wrong-headed and divisive or have been undermined by his own actions and hypocrisy.  His crowing about Canada is back has proven to be classic Trudeau.  Lots of talk, lots of teeth, lots of hair, very little success.  Look at NAFTA, our relations with China, just ask the farmers who used to export pork and canola.  Our sorry efforts at peacekeeping, And yet, in this election, Trudeau has delivered speech after speech, touting his successes.  Speeches filled with nonsense and exaggerations, and when called on his nonsense, he smiles, gives a few more fairy tales, and smiles again.  It makes no sense to re-elect a man who has admitted that he has failed, and has no idea why, or what he would do differently if re-elected.  It is only good to make mistakes if you learn from them.  I was the longest-serving president of the Liberal Party of Canada.  I was elected twice by a party that believed in the betterment of people.  It was not a group dedicated to the aggrandizement of one person.  And to vote for Trudeau because I have always voted.  Liberal is just like beating your head against the wall because it might feel better when you stop.  Those days of party loyalty throughout the generations should be at an end.  Instead, the duty of any citizen is to read the platforms, watch the debates, learn about the leaders, and cast an informed vote, not a mindless party loyalty vote.  For the last four years, most of the wisdom from, quote, political scientists, which is an oxymoron, there has never been a science in politics, has been that Canada will never vote out a Liberal government after only one term.  Some commentators are still in disbelief that Trudeau could even only receive a minority.  But Trudeau has failed.  Why would Canadians renew his mandate?  Many Canadians acknowledge that this is an election of hard choices.  But so is every election.  We have a duty to elect who can do better in the next four years.  Think about that civic duty on Monday.  It's important. ",
