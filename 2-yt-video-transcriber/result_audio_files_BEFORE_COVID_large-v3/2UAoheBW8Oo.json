You guys, Gavin Newsom is arresting me.  So I've been arrested here at Gavin Newsom's mansion, the governor's mansion.  Gavin Newsom is Nancy Pelosi's nephew.  And look, I thought that everyone was welcome here.  They spend $23 billion a year on illegal immigration here in California alone, over $220 billion nationally.  Illegally, you're welcome here and the democrats will give you free health care free housing.  on the taxpayer dime right.  we just wish you could do that job for all the illegals that are coming into our country.  right that'd be awesome.  as an american you're not allowed to hop over gavin newsom's fence or nancy pelosi's fence.  you get handcuffed and arrested but if you're an illegal alien or you're a rapist or you kill innocent police officers or you murder and rape women here you have to be welcomed here.  So look at guys, look, this is a perfect example of what Donald Trump is trying to champion.  All right.  America first.  Right.  You have an American citizen, a journalist being arrested outside Gavin Newsom's yard.  But then all the illegal aliens here, the illegal aliens who hopped the fence at Nancy Pelosi's place last week were not arrested.  And they're here illegally.  My hat.  Put my hat back on.  And you know, look, the Democrats, they don't want to compromise with Donald Trump.  They don't want to compromise with our great President Donald Trump, who's trying to improve border security.  Yeah, that's my ID.  You can put all my stuff back in.  They don't want to compromise.  But they're hypocrites, you guys.  Democrats didn't want to compromise.  We spend $23 billion a year on illegal immigration.  Thank you, Laura. ",
