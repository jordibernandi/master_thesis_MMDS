And this goes for Texas, it doesn't go for other states.  You may have a similar law and you should check that law in your locality.  But in Texas, The only time that you're required to give a peace officer identifying information is if the officer has arrested you.  You can see in subjection A, it's clearly outlined.  If an officer has you lawfully arrested, you're required to give that information.  That's the only time that it's against the law to not give information, to refuse to give information.  The only other crime you could be committing under the statute is if you give them false information.  Now, giving false information is always illegal.  It doesn't matter if you're arrested, detained, or otherwise.  If you give them false information under the three categories, arrested, detained, or if they believe you're a witness to a crime, then it is against the law to give them false information.  But we're talking about the requirement to give them information when you are not under arrest, and the answer is no, you don't have to.  Now, if you want to play that game, you go ahead.  That doesn't mean they're not going to arrest you.  Unfortunately, and as disgusting as it is, they don't know how to read this and apply this law.  I can tell you from my experience, that's not the case.  They don't like the law, they ignore it, and they arrest you anyway.  That's another topic.  Anyway, I just thought I'd review the law with you guys.  Enjoy the rest of the video. ",
