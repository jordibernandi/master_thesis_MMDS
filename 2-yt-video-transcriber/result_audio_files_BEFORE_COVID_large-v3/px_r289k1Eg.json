Rochelle and Juwan Rapley say their younger brother, Roosevelt Rapley, was the second of 10 siblings killed by gunfire. ",

            "text": "All right, so you saw that, you heard that, you see what's going on.  Now, this was totally ridiculous, totally crazy.  How are you going to get mad at somebody for defending themselves against an armed robber?  I could see if the person just went in there acting a little crazy, just kind of cussing and fussing, not really posing an actual threat.  But when somebody has a gun in your face and says, hey, give it up, i'm gonna blow your brains out away.  what are you gonna do if i have a gun on me and i see somebody pull their gun?  hey it is what it is.  you're gonna have to go.  it's nothing against you nothing against your family members.  but when it comes to life and it being either you or me guess what it's not gonna be me.  so the only other option left is for it to be you.  as simple as that why would this person talk about oh wow you can't bring a gun to defend yourself like.  that's what the second amendment is for literally to defend yourself and for the country to defend itself from outside threats okay domestic and foreign that should be what purpose of your guns are and also to hunt you know get food or whatever.  but really the number one thing is to defend yourself, okay?  That's just like saying, if you're in the comfort of your own home, and somebody kicks your door down with a gun out, you can't shoot them.  Yes, I am gonna shoot them, 100% of the time, because again, if it's between my life, my loved one's life, and your life, the criminal with a gun in my face is not gonna be me, it's not gonna be my loved ones, it's gonna be you.  It's very, very simple.  But that kind of mentality you saw right there, this is the conundrum that many in the black community and in the world or United States, at least on the left, they kind of find themselves in this weird situation.  You don't want regular everyday people to have guns to defend themselves, but you don't really see a problem with criminals having it.  Okay, you want to rely upon the police to protect you, but the reality is police can't truly protect you.  Not all the time, unless they're right there in that particular situation, which in most times of a home invasion, a store robbery, they're not right there.  They're going to come afterwards to either collect bodies, to get witness statements, testimony, whatever the case may be.  They're not going to actually be there to protect you.  So you got to protect yourself.  And then when the police come afterwards, you can give this story about what happened rather than being a victim.  And they got to piece things together to figure out what happened.  Why is this store owner dead in a Dollar General?  Which is what easily could have happened.  If somebody comes in there and they're bold enough to present a gun and rob you, I mean, the next step wouldn't be too far to actually kill you or to seriously injure you, to permanently injure you, you know, to get paralyzed or whatever the case.  And also to the young lady talking about call the police.  Don't bring a gun to work.  She'd be the same kind of person that says, I don't trust the police after police.  I don't trust the quote unquote system, whatever that is.  So you want to rely upon the police to protect you with their guns.  But at the same time, you say the police can't be trusted.  So which one is it?  I'm confused.  Shouldn't you be able to protect yourself as is your right as an American citizen rather than relying upon the police?  So you don't even trust.  OK, like this should be a prime example.  This case.  about why you need a second amendment.  I feel bad for any of his family members that aren't involved in any silliness like the lady was that have lost their loved one.  I feel bad for them.  And I'm sure you had a mama, grandmama.  I feel bad for them.  They had nothing to do with it.  You know, they just at the house doing whatever.  They didn't send him out there to do what he did.  They're not on TV trying to excuse his behavior.  I feel bad for them.  Okay, I don't feel bad for the lady talking about, oh, well, call the police.  I mean, come on.  Like, that was just crazy.  But the person that got killed got what they came for.  You know when you out there doing these things, when you out here running and gunning, committing crime, you know the end result could be you in the casket, you in the penitentiary.  You're taking penitentiary chances.  You're taking life and death chances.  That's just the name of the game.  And if you're going to play it, you got to abide by the rules.  And this is exactly what happened here.  so shout out to the dollar general store clerk let this be a lesson to anybody that wants to rob a store a home evade or to deprive someone else of their rights of their money of their property.  whatever the case may be you might not find an easy mark.  you might end up with a really bad situation on your hands that you can't get out of it ain't gonna be?  no restart or reset or nah once it's over it's over dead.  you can't come back or in jail forever.  but i think i'll leave that right there for now.  what say you?  do you think that the case here was appropriate for the store clerk to use their gun in self-defense and to not be charged?  well i've not seen about any charges.  it shouldn't be.  it's a clear self-defense case even if any member came out there and said what happened.  you know oh what.  i forgot one thing the big whopper here was and what?  so what?  they're robbing it.  it's like what This kind of mentality of being entitled to things to say, or you can rob a store with no consequences.  Don't protect yourself.  Call the police.  That kind of mentality is just not congruent with American society.  And people like that are not really going to be able to function.  But I'm not correct about what I'm saying.  People with that kind of mentality will not be able to function in America.  And this kind of mentality, this entitlement mentality is destroying many communities and many people.  Overall, not just black, not just white, but really most of the left.  They feel like this, like they're entitled to live a certain way that others may not want to live.  You can just rob somebody either by the gun in a dollar general or rob somebody through the gun from the government, raising taxes, raising all kind of fees and penalties and this, that and the third.  OK, is that a right thing to do?  Is it appropriate?  do you think this whole incident proves why we need a second amendment?  you got to have it.  you're going to be in a dangerous area in a dangerous situation.  you want to be able to have that great equalizer which is that gun.  if criminals can have guns and it's not really a big deal according to people like that who were talking in a news clip why can't civilians have it?  okay let's just have an equal playing field.  you want to play the game let's play.  The game is going out there, harming people, taking things from people, and the other side has to be able to defend itself.  The winner wins.  The loser loses.  If you don't want to lose, don't play the game.  Don't get involved.  Just be a regular Joe.  Be a square.  Get a job.  Don't go around running and gunning, and maybe you'll keep your life.
