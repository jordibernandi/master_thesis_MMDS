Those contradictions are too blatant.  Once you show these contradictions out to the people, you say, now what are you going to Vietnam for when you can't even burn this thing down before you go to Vietnam?  That makes sense.  They can begin to understand that.  Now the contradictions, now what the power structure is trying to do is to blur the contradictions.  See, like they have some black people on television.  They have some black legislators here.  They have some black elected officials here.  They put a few black people here to make it appear as if things are getting better.  They're not as bad as they are.  And of course, what happens in this period, the people just take stock of what's going on.  Everybody knows things are not getting better. ",

Because as black people began to fight and spill their blood and rebel, the white man knew he had to grant some concessions.  As a matter of fact, the strength of black people is reflected right here in George Wallace.  George Wallace, 10 years ago, stood in the state of Alabama doorway, outstretched, and said he would never let a black man come into that school, over his dead body.  And just in a short period of 10 years, he had to turn his position completely around and come and beg black people to vote for him.  And that shows the strength and the power of our people. ",

And when blacks moved, especially in Montgomery, Alabama, since the period of, let's say, the 50s, When Dr.  King began the Montgomery bus boycott, for example, they started an assault against the white power structure, which again, with overall contradictions in the country, had them weak.  But the white power structure will again begin to try and consolidate itself.  Once it begins to try and consolidate itself again, it will move against black people.
