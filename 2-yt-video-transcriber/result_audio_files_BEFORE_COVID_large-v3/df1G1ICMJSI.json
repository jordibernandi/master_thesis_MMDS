All that it means is that there was surviving texts that Catholics didn't burn on the way to modernity, and that the Roman Empire was Christian in its dying breath.  Polytheists understand that the Northern Crusades were a genocidal effort and not an effort to preserve pagan manuscripts for later god competitions.  There's actually quite a bit of effort on our part to rebuild these ancient faiths in spite of missing manuscripts.  So my bottom line is this.  If a Christian wants to rest their case against the gods on pieces of paper produced by oppressive regimes in medieval Christendom, I'll take it.  The number of manuscripts is irrelevant to the truth claim with respect to deity.  Polytheists don't follow the gods because of the number of manuscripts.  Christians don't either.  Pagans are often spiritual because we embrace personal, lived experiences with the gods.  Quantifying proliferation of manuscripts does nothing to help nor hinder that important point.  But I'll say that I can't speak for Christians because they have this whole hell thing that will sometimes keep them in the faith regardless of their experiences counter to the faith.  Be it experiences or even rational argumentation that suggests polytheism or atheism.  This was certainly the case for me.  I didn't get out of Christianity until I broke my hell belief. ",

He says, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you dismiss all the other citizens of our community as the killer for the same reason.  I reject my client as the killer.

Because the one fewer God comment is an attempt to apply consistency of interpreting evidence, in a strange way.  this would be exactly what a defense lawyer should always be arguing, that the evidence to convict their client fails to meet the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.
