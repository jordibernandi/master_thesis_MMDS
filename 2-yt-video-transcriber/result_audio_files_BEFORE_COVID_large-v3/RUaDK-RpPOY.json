Now, I know, because I've served in small branches, that they do ask for input from the branch committee.  right but we know that the elders book for example and i also know that the letters for elders because i've seen them in english from canada branch i've seen them in in creole from the haiti branch and i've seen them in spanish from the dominican republic branch because i served in haiti and dominica and the letters of the elders are pretty well exactly the same no matter where you go.  so to tell them that the way the cases were handled in australia Well, that was the Australian branch that kind of decided on their own what to do.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  These things go right up to the committees in Brooklyn when they're considering how to handle with situations like this.  And if they were to actually get a subpoena to go in and get all of the communication, they would find that the Australian branch was directed by the communities of the governing body.  And that's what they were acting on.  But it's an idea of them isolating because, no, no, we can't be held responsible.  We can't go to jail.  We can't have the governing body in jail.

And that's one thing that actually caused me to wake up as well, because I realized that you might have elders that make bad decisions on their own, the way they handle something, or they might have something written and they ignore what's written.  They do their own thing.  Yes.  That can happen.  But for me, one of the realizations that I realized the organization was not Christian, not directed by God.  is because I started to examine the policies, the things that were taught to all of the elders right from the top.  In other words, if the teaching was bad, then I got to stay away from this.  Like I can't have a part of it.  It's one thing.  If an elder goes and does something bad and you're like, you know what?  I'm going to have nothing to do with that elder.  But when you discover that the teaching is bad, the policies, the instructions to all of the elders worldwide are wrong.  Then you're like, I can't have anything to do with this.  Like that's the way it was for me.  I can't go back to this.  Right.  So when you have these lawsuits and, You know, in the Royal Commission, they were actually focusing in on not what the elders had done individually.  They were focusing in on what the elders are instructed to do with.  In one example, you know, someone who is a victim of child abuse and they want nothing to do with the congregation, but they still want to have a social relationship with some of their friends.  But no, they're disfellowshipped because they brought a lawsuit or they're disfellowshipped because they say they don't want to have anything to do with the organization.  And basically, the lawyers are saying you're cutting them off from all the help that they could receive from their friends because you've labeled them as an apostate or as someone that is rogue.  So they were focusing on the policies themselves.  The teachings right from the governing body.  Yes.  And they're finding that it's bad.  Like there was elders in that commission.  I say elders, lawyers that knew not too much about the Bible, but they were able to pick it out and they were able to drill these elders and the branch, the branch committee member and the governing body was like, wait a minute, this doesn't make sense.  what you guys are teaching, even according to the scriptures.  And I was just like, how is it possible that an elder, I'm sorry, a lawyer from the world, can perceive justice.  They can perceive what's right better than a branch committee member or a governing body member. ",

Because he's disfellowshipped.  Disfellowshipped.  Yeah.  And he basically made a case that his business had suffered because they were telling everybody not to go to him for business, right?  And so... The moment comes for the Bethel lawyer to take the stand.  Now, I know him.  I know personally the brother that's in front of the Supreme Court.  I'm watching the video.  I'm saying, oh, that's David, right?  His name is David Ganim.  And I used to, you know, sit with him at Bethel at the table.  I even invited this brother to give a public talk in our congregation and invited him to come over for a meal after the talk to sit around and to tell us all these stories about the legal battles in other countries, right?  Because he was in the legal department.  And he came over and he told us all these stories of Russia and Georgia and this and that.  And we were all like, oh, wow, these legal battles, right?  So, you know, I know this brother.  He gets up in front of the Supreme Court and he tells the judge, He says, well, this fellowshipping is just basically a separation of the kind of the spiritual relationship.

I know a lot of them.  I was served in the same congregation as one.  And they do not go to a Supreme Court.  You know, a court, a Supreme Court, without having sat around and talked about what are we going to say.  So this was prepared in the Canada branch.  And he went to the court and he's basically telling them that when someone's disfellowshipped, oh yeah, we still have business and family relations, normal family relationship continues.  And normal business continues.  It's only spiritually we're not connected.  And I'm thinking he lied.  He lied to the Supreme Court.  And I'm thinking, if witnesses truly believe that what they're doing is based on the Bible, why are they lying about it?  They should be proud.  This is what the Bible says, and this is what we're sticking to.  But it's like they don't want to be held responsible for something that the law of the land sees as wrong in their eyes, in the ways of the law of the land.  Because they realize if they lose, they lose money.  They lose position.  They lose their reputation, maybe.  It means they're going to have less results in the ministry when they go to knock on doors because they don't know about what they've been doing.  So it's all about keeping the organization alive.  It's not about saying the truth on oath.  It's about giving an appearance, even if that means lying.  Every witness will tell you, Normal family relations do not continue when someone is disfellowshipped.  Normal business relations do not continue.  David Guenam should have told them, you know what?  You're right, Your Honor.  We don't have business relationship when someone gets disfellowshipped.  We try to cut it off.  You know, like you hear about a brother getting disfellowshipped.  Anyone that worked with them, they start looking for new jobs.  Seriously.  I know a brother in the Dominican used disfellowshipped.  And he had only pioneers working for him, right?  Because they needed a part-time job.  He was flexible.  So he had people split jobs, right?  And as soon as he does fellowship, the elders are visiting the different brothers and sisters that work for him, tell him they got to stop working there.  One of the sisters even had a blind father and a brother in Bethel.  So, you know, you have a brother in Bethel, you're not getting any help financially from him, right?  Because if he was working on the outside, maybe he'd be bringing something for the family.  But he's in Bethel, a blind father, and she's working for this brother who got this fellowship.  And the elders come and pressure her to leave her job. ",

They want to leave religion because they don't want to come to this church and sit with a guy who molested them.  And even the elders who testify, they asked one of the elders, little chubby guy, they asked him, did you believe the girl when she told you?  And he said, yeah, we believe that she had been molested.  So they didn't even deny, but because of the way the rules are structured, but since we ain't got nobody else, we can't do that.  So you go on the front of Kingdom Hall, you smile, and we're going to still call him for the questions at the watchtower, and y'all don't be telling nobody else in the Kingdom Hall.  That is the basic situation.  And so that was what the judge kept asking.  This person comes to the church, sits over here, looks at y'all talking to this person, know this person's molested.  They know that y'all know it and y'all believe it, but because of the rules, nothing is done.  So they decide, you know what, I can't do this.  And as a result of the person who is the victim, they now get re-victimized by the whole denomination. ",

And before you know it, like within less than a week before the next meeting, everybody is now giving you the cold shoulder.  They're not talking to you.  They're, you're looking at you out of the corner of their eyes, kind of like, I don't know about him, but we're going to have to watch him.

Cause it just, if they already have feelings of, of being rejection or feeling that, you know, these negative feelings, that treatment just reinforced.

It's not that there's something wrong with 8 million other people, because that's very unlikely that 8 million people are wrong.  And I'm right.  No, no, it can't be that.  It must be.  I'm wrong and they're all right, you know, because you're thinking of numbers.  There's so many things that come into your mind and your thoughts.  And, you know, I'd eventually like to just kind of get all my thoughts out there.  Not because what I'm thinking is correct, because, hey, I could be wrong on things.  Hey, we're all wrong on things at times.  Absolutely.  But I thought, you know, I went through a time where I was completely alone.  Like, I mean, it was, and it was difficult.  I had no contact with anyone.  And I just thought, you know what, if there's others going through that and they're completely alone, I think it might be comforting for them to know that, hey, there's someone else that felt exactly the same way or similar at least.  And that might be some sort of comfort.  that, you know what, you're not going crazy.  It's, there's not a problem with you.  Just write it out.  If you can try to, you know, get help, et cetera, et cetera.  Because I remember having to do that all by myself with no, no one.  It was, it was a difficult goal.  It really was.  If I, if it hadn't been for the fact that I felt that Christ himself was interested in me in a person, I might even take and take in my own life.  Yeah.  And it's just, I think of all those people out there that could be going through the same situation and that rejection.  And I'm thinking, you know what, if I just tell how I felt or what I went through, what I was thinking, maybe there's something similar.  And maybe it'll help someone so they don't give up on themselves or give up on life.  Because that's really, really a sad thing.  It really is. ",
