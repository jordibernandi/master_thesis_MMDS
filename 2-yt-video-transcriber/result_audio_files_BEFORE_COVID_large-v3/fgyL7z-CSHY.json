            "text": "Welcome ladies and gentlemen to Blue Ridge Silverhound.  I'm your host Sean this evening and today we're going to talk about probably a coin that not a lot of people think about ever having any sort of value just because they're so plentiful, but I'm happy to announce.  1968 lincoln cents actually has some value to it but you got to know what you're looking for.  okay just like any other date of coin there are a number of ways that you could find a coin that is worth some money all right.  so for those of you have that have never been on to one of my broadcasts or episodes first of all welcome.  thank you for joining.  hit that subscribe button if you like what you see in this one.  Most importantly, I like to talk about every conceivable thing that you can find within a specific date of coin.  We've talked about a wide selection of various dates, various denominations, from pennies all the way up to dollar coins and beyond.  And... I want you guys to feel like you're getting your airtime's worth out of this.  So we're going to discuss not only the coin itself, how many were produced, do they have any value in those high grades that everybody loves to collect, but we're also going to deep dive into various varieties and errors that may exist out there.  Believe it or not, they come up when you least expect them.  but 1968 pennies here we go.  we're going to get started in the best way possible and that's just for the first probably like five minutes of this video.  I'm going to discuss each individual branch mint.  of course there are Philadelphia Denver and San Francisco minted coins that were all produced for general circulation.  the only exception is for 1968. for the San Francisco coin they did produce a proof finish coin that was made specifically for the collector market.  Okay, these coins are going to exhibit a much stronger strike than what we call the quote unquote business strike coins or made for circulation type strikes.  So these coins again will have a strong strike.  They'll have those mirrored fields.  You might see some with the, what they call a cameo finish on the devices on the actual raised uh design features of the coin.  you're going to see that nice frosting on there.  but we're not going to be talking about the proof coins just the circulated stuff that you see out in change and in rolls today.  so we're going to go ahead and kick it off with the philadelphia minted coin.  all right.  so the reason why that this is important of a date is because there are three recognizable business strike.  um The Philadelphia minted coin is one of the more common dates out of the 1960s.  How common you ask?  Well, 1,707,880,970 total pieces were produced.  for circulation through the Philadelphia mint.  Now, of course, with Philadelphia, you don't have the recognizable mint mark under the date, unlike the Denver and San Francisco mint, but we're going to see that here in a moment.  One of the key things that people like to collect about these coins is high grades.  Now we have these third party graders like PCGS, NGC, Annex, ICG.  You have these third party graders that go out and they grade these coins.  People submit them, they come back with a grade value in an encapsulated plastic holder, and then you could possibly have a coin that's worth many hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.  For 1968, we're going to go ahead and use the PCGS census information, so to speak, for this coin.  So the highest grade that PCGS has assigned to a 1968 Philadelphia coin is mint state 67 plus full red.  All right, that's a really nice high grade.  Only three examples were graded as such through that grading company.  Now the highest sale recorded for this particular coin was a Mint State 67 Plus and it sold for $2,880.  August of 2018. through Stax Bowers.  This is a really nice high-end piece right here.  But as its numbers indicate, okay, it's a very highly minted coin, but not a lot of them were preserved in the highest grades.  So definitely keep an eye out for coins that look like this.  So the next branch mint coin I wanted to talk about that you may be able to find and change would be the 1968D, Denver Minted Lincoln Cent.  Now again, this is the highest minted coin out of the three for the date, with 2,886,269,600 total pennies were produced by the Denver Mint, effectively making it one of the highest mintage of coins during the 1960s.  So in terms of the grading aspect of it, PCGS has assigned only one coin at the highest grade level.  And that grade level is mint state 67 plus full red.  Now you would assume because of the higher mintage value, there would be more of these available in a 67 plus or higher.  That may not be the case.  60 AD was widely circulated.  But that makes the cherry pick, the treasure hunt, that much more fruitful, guys.  Much more interesting and exciting.  Now, PCGS has a price guide value of this coin in this grade at $3,000.  However, I am happy to announce a sale by... Great collections.  Not even a year ago, as a matter of fact, December 30th of 2018, they consigned this one loan 67 plus and it sold for $4,617.  on that day, making it $1,600 more than the actual PCGS price guide value.  Now, some would say, well, coins generally sell for less than price guide value a lot of the time.  However, in this case, because there is that one loan example, it's sold for 150% of that price guide value listed by PCGS.  That's a tremendous coin to look for.  Some of you might be able to find that number two example.  Now finally we're going to go ahead and take a look at the final branch mint coined for the Lincoln cent during 1968 and that's the San Francisco as evidenced by the tiny little s underneath the date.  Now this one right here is the toughest out of the three mintage wise.  Only 258,270,001 pieces were produced from the San Francisco Mint, making it the smallest mintage out of the three.  Now the highest grade assigned by PCGS for the San Francisco 1968 is Mint State 68 Red.  Okay, that's a nice high lofty grade.  Only one example in the state with this mint mark exists and were graded by PCGS.  Now that coin never made it onto the secondary market, so we don't have any sales figures to go by for this one particular coin like we did the 68D.  However, PCGS has a price guide value of $8.68, that one loan coin, of $7,500, ladies and gentlemen.  As a matter of fact, okay, let me take that back, $7,400.  I was $100 too high, but it doesn't really make any difference.  That's a buko amount of bucks, guys.  Keep an eye out for such high grade coins like the one that you see here on screen.  And you might want to throw a roll of the dice.  It's not easy to get some of these grades, but you have to be really cautious about what you find.  Buy yourself a magnifier, take a look at the coin as close as you can, and identify some of the cleanest examples that are free from nicks, carbon spots, and any other sort of distracting marks or features on the coin that might detract it from those high grade levels.  So those are the three branch minted coins I wanted to talk about.  Now let's go ahead and dive into something that's probably a little bit more kind of achievable for collectors like you and I. And that's varieties and errors.  So we're going to take a look at the two most widely collected varieties for the 1968 Lincoln cent.  And I'm happy to say they are both Denver minted coins.  So the first one that I wanted to draw your attention to is a 1968 D over D. Okay, this is affectionately referred to in the variety field as a repunched mint mark or RPM for short.  This is also cataloged in the cherry pickers guide as an FS501.  now this coin here i'm not gonna lie it's relatively common coins in even the lowest grades still sell for that five to ten dollar region because people want a recognizable variety.  that is shown in the cherry pickers guide which is one of the big resources for cherry picking.  some varieties okay.  so people still want the 68d over d Low grades, again, we're talking about $5 to $10 coin, but that's better than the one cent face value that you had originally discovered.  Now, higher grade examples do sell for a considerable amount of money more.  We might be talking between $50 and $200, especially if it's graded through a third party service.  So you definitely want to keep an eye out for this coin.  Be sure you use a magnifier that's about 10 times power or higher so that way you can see the diagnostical features of this coin's variety.  So I do have one other variety to talk about and this is the exciting one.  This is one that people have a hard time looking for because either they just don't know about it or they have a coin that's too low of a grade to see the diagnostical features.  But it's a 1968D doubled die reverse Lincoln cent.  This is again another marquee cherry pickers guide variety that people love to look for.  and they love to cherry pick and search for it, especially in the higher grades.  Now, this coin right here, if you're able to find one that's relatively circulated, like a VF to AU condition coin, this is still a $20 to $50 coin on its own.  And you don't necessarily have to have it graded.  That's the beauty part, because it's a variety that speaks all on its own as being a recognizable and very sought after coin in the variety community.  Now higher graded examples can hit up to $750 to $1,000.  You know, if it's a full red, maybe a mint state 67 example, those coins are going to command all the money in the world for a double to die reverse.  Now, what I didn't add, at least I don't think so, this is also cataloged as an FS801.  But go ahead and take a look at the close-up images that I have here of the reverse.  Now, you're going to have a lot of spread.  Okay, the notching is going to be there, but you can see These diagnostical features may not be readily apparent on coins that are of lesser grade.  So make sure you have a strong enough magnifier and know what you're looking for in order to key this one in as a variety that you have discovered.  But all in all, it's a really neat discovery piece.  One in which that still commands a good chunk of money because double dies... in retrospect are one of the most widely coveted varieties in coin collecting today.  so keep an eye out for this one now.  finally i want to jump into a few errors that you may come across in your searches.  Now these are three coins that have sold on Great Collections.  They range from mild to wild.  But we're going to go ahead and get started with a few coins here.  The first one that you see on screen is a 1968D.  Now this one right here, has kind of some funny things going on with it as you can see on the images.  but this one um is a struck through error okay both on the obverse or the front of the coin and also the reverse.  so you kind of have this uh this anomaly where it looks like there's.  um there's a void in both the obverse which is right above the date and the reverse of the coin.  um you know something was on the coin before it was struck and then it fought fell out As soon as the coin was ejected from the striking chamber.  Okay, but it's a really neat coin.  This one graded PCGS Mint State 62 Brown.  So it's seen a little bit of circulation.  This one sold for $66 on Great Collections July 20th of 2014. probably not necessary to get it graded at this grade level and it'll sell on its own no problem.  so that's the first error.  the second error that i wanted to talk about is the one that you see here now.  this one is a little bit confusing to some.  this is a 1968 s. however this one has a unique kind of error which is called a die adjustment strike.  Now when coins are struck, and they're struck in large numbers, the US Mint employees actually test out a few of the coins to ensure that the pressurization of the strike is optimal.  So that way you get a full upset obverse and reverse impression on both sides of the coin.  Now there are times that they will try and strike a coin and the pressure is too light.  Then you'll have a coin that looks like on screen here where you're kind of like missing a lot of the design detail.  Especially most notable in the middle of the coin and it kind of goes out from there.  But this is another coin that you guys can look for out there and it's worth money.  The error community loves die adjustment strikes.  They don't come up that often in auctions and most people just don't know what they have here.  Some would assume that they are struck through grease errors, which looks similar, but this one affects both sides of the coin.  So this one right here is an Annex Mint State 60 Brown.  This one sold on Great Collections June 23rd of 2013 for also $66.  So that's another coin that can be sold on its own without any certification.  So keep an eye out for stuff that look like this.  And finally, the last error that I want to talk about is going to be this 1968 S Lincoln cent.  This one, however, was struck on a clad 10 cent Roosevelt dime planchette.  all right so this one here is pretty neat.  i'm not gonna lie to you.  this is a coin right here that obviously is silver looking looks very much like a dime in not only its appearance but also its size.  this one is a pcgs mint state 64 coin that's sold on great collections january 11th of 2015 in the amount of 352 dollars.  so guys that wraps up my kind of like expose on the 1968 lincoln cents.  again from the very beginning to the end i've produced a whole bunch of value areas of opportunity where you can capitalize and really pounce on some of your coin.  roll hunting and just general searching of pocket change that you get from the store or the restaurants.  you know as you come across them.  but there is a lot of opportunity to find that one little piece of treasure that maybe to another person may look like damage or just may not look like anything particularly fancy at all.  but you know to certain other people they're worth the world all right and then for the world they're willing to pay with you know a large amount of money and they're going to open up their purses and wallets to obtain that coin.  so i hope you guys appreciate the 1968 lincoln set.  um at a glance video.  uh hopefully hopefully you guys find some of these great amazing coins that i've highlighted for you today.
