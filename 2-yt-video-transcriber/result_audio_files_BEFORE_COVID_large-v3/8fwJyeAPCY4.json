            "text": "What is up everybody?  What a glorious few days.  I think it is safe to say that the storm is definitely upon us.  Now for starters, we have the news that we've all been waiting with bated breath for.  No Russian collusion.  Once and for all, the fake news media has been exposed as the conspiracy theorist.  psychos they are, and it is glorious.  I mean, even John Brennan was forced to eat shit and state that he must have gotten bad info.  Yeah, okay.  Next, we have the Justice Department, who just declared that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional and could not agree more.  The Vice President has just called for Ilhan Omar's removal from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  That's a no-brainer.  Mike Pompeo just announced a ban on aid to abortion groups, which has flown a bit under the radar, but in my opinion is huge.  Michael Avanti another winner just was arrested for extortion.  I think he's facing something like 107 years in jail and it was revealed that his accomplice was Jussie Smollett's lawyer Mark Garagos which I suspect must have had something to do with his charges being dropped literally the next day.  you know aside from the text from prosecutor Kim Fox's Smollett family members where she's promising to try and get him off and the fact that George Soros had donated $408 thousand dollars to her seems an oddly specific number.  but moving on we finally have someone who asked the question bill mitchell who after stating that he believes q is real and pointing out the all too obvious observation that the same people who were working overtime to push this russian hoax even though they knew damn well it was made up, are coincidentally the same people writing article after article, spinning Q to look like a dangerous madman cult leader, which he's absolutely not.  He's actually never once called for violence and implores us to do our own research and quote, think for ourselves.  Whoa, what a crazy cult leader.  God, this is stupid.  And finally, what has to be my favorite news in a long, Long time, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's new green deal was decimated today when it got voted down in a triumphant 0-57.  Oh man, is that the greatest thing I've ever heard?  I don't know what it is.  But anyway, just wanted to make this quick video to declare it official.  The storm has just begun to rain.  Where we go one, we go all.  Thank you. ",
