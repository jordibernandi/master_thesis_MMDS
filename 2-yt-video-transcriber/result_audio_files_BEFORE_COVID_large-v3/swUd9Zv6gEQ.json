In fact, due to some recent experiences that I'm not going to get into again... I've come to accept it.  What stresses me about death is not being dead.  It's what I'll miss out on.  One of those experiences, one I haven't discussed, actually came from playing around in virtual reality, specifically Google Earth VR.  I've been exploring the Earth, seeing foreign places, and I was sort of wandering around in Tokyo and Hokkaido, looking at the scenery, the buildings, and thinking about how each one had people in them with their own stories, their own lives.  I found myself wondering who they all were, wishing I could know.  And then I zoomed out and saw how huge those cities are, and how I could go exploring them for the next year, street by street, and still not see it all.  And then I zoomed out again and saw how tiny those huge cities are compared to just Japan, never mind the rest of the world.  and then realizing how the Earth is just one tiny planet in a huge galaxy, and the galaxy is just one of billions in our huge universe.  It was actually a very humbling experience knowing how small I am, how little I matter in the grand scheme of things.  but more what i felt was disappointment that i can never see all of it.  i wanted to keep exploring.  i want to be around for when humanity has interstellar travel if we ever do and see even more what's out there death itself doesn't stress me.  it's what i'll miss out on.  that makes me unhappy.

But actually you do, because if you're an atheist and you believe that you are nothing more than atoms and particles and molecules, that your existence ends when you die.  When you die, you are just as one atheist friend put it to be worm food.  Some things do follow.  And in fact, one of my favorite kind of writers is the atheist philosopher Bertrand Russell, who figured this out and it kept him awake at night.  In one of his most famous pieces of writing, Bertrand said, the problem is if, you know, If this life is all there is, then one day I will die, but it doesn't end there.  One day the human race will become extinct.  One day the sun will expand and swallow the earth.  One day the universe will come to an end.  And as he put it, the whole of mankind's achievements will be buried beneath the universe in ruins.  In other words, why bother doing anything now?  because the outcome is the same?  Live a good life, live a bad life.  The outcome is the same.  It's humanity.  We can strive to improve things or we can just sit there and do nothing.  But it makes no difference. ",

Well, of course it makes a difference.  If someone is nice to you or mean to you, it matters here and now.  It makes your experience of life better or worse.  And I dare you to tell me with a straight face that how you experience life doesn't matter.  Pleasure, pain, happiness, boredom, It all matters.  And that's where people like Andy and people like me differ.  I don't feel the need for some ultimate purpose or meaning, something more grand than the here and now.  It's not a driving force in my life.  One of my favorite song lyrics is, we can't spend our lives waiting to live.  We can't spend our lives waiting to live.  But that's what people who think they're going to some Abrahamic-style afterlife are doing, isn't it?  This life is just prep for heaven.  Or hell, I guess.

A few years ago now, a distant cousin of mine tragically took his own life.  And so at the funeral, they had a humanist funeral.  He had no religious faith, nor did his girlfriend.  And I was really struck by the fact the best that the person, the humanist chaplain celebrating, doing the celebration or whatever they call it, could offer at the end of the service was to say, Jonathan will live on forever in our memories.

Andy says that's the only hope that could be given, but that statement, that mindset, makes a lot of assumptions about what people want and need.

Andy's religion may offer to fill a need he has, but it's that need for hope that matters.  I hope to travel to outer space someday.  Andy might not give a crap.  I'm offered hope by the fact that NASA is now offering space tourism the chance to go to the International Space Station for a few days.  A bit out of my price range, at least for now, but that possibility is there and it offers me some hope.  Hope Andy might not need, assuming he doesn't care about space travel.  And it's the same thing with atheism, but in reverse.  I don't need the hope Andy claims atheism doesn't offer, and his claim that there is no hope in atheism is purely subjective, personal, specific to the individual's wants, desires, and needs.  That's all.  And what exactly?  is this hope that Andy needs anyway?  I mean, I sort of get it, I can kind of empathize, but I'm not sure I can articulate it exactly.  At least, not succinctly.  I could probably do a whole video on what Andy needs so badly from religion, and even then I'd probably do a crap job of it, because I don't need it myself. ",

There's, yes, there's a physical part of us, but there's a supernatural part of us as well.  We are made for a relationship, an internal relationship that can begin now and carry on into eternity with a God who created and made us.  And what the Bible says is that every human being, when they die, will meet, will see face-to-face their creator.  And all of us at that point will also be held to account for the life that we've lived, whether we've lived it well, whether we've lived it badly.  And the problem of course is that none of us really can measure up at that point because all of us could have done better, all of us could have lived better, all of us could have made wiser choices.

The idea that a virtuous atheist goes to hell and a serial killer theist goes to heaven simply because they believed in the invisible sky man.  That doesn't give me hope.  That makes me quite angry.  Oh, don't get me wrong.  I don't mean that I'm angry at a god I don't think exists.  At least, not a different kind of angry than I get with other fictional characters like, say, Darth Vader.  But I get angry with believers.  Let me tell you a story of something that happened to me quite recently.  Most of you know that I help staff an atheism booth in Balboa Park on Saturdays.  There are also other booths there, many of them religious.  I got to chatting with one of the guys at the booth that sets up next to ours, and he seemed like a nice enough guy when not talking about religion.  We share some mutual interests, like sci-fi and such.  But we got to talking about heaven and hell, who goes there and why, and he insisted that I will be going to hell for being a lesbian and an atheist.  Well, I got rather angry with him.  Some of you may recall a recent video.  I did explaining how God is the villain, the bad guy, because of some of the atrocities he's committed, that any other character doing those things would be the enemy.  I made that video because of him, because he's allied himself to that horrible character, that ideology.  And I told him that I didn't want to know him anymore, that it made him, in my eyes, a bad person.  And I stormed off.  Last week at the booth, he handed me an envelope.  Well, actually, he didn't hand it to me.  He handed it to someone else in the group, and they gave it to me.  Inside was a card and an Amazon Kindle gift certificate for $25.  And he wrote on the card, Hello, Kate.  I hope that this card is a blessing to you and enjoyable.  In Christ and then his name.  I'm going to give it back to him.  I thought about it, and the more I did, the more angry it made me.  He believes that I'm going to be tortured for eternity for no crime worse than being who I am, hurting nobody and not believing in his God, and that somehow $25 is going to make up for that.  How dare he?  Sure, his beliefs are meaningless to me, but they mean something to him, and this is the bridge he thought to build.  Really.  This is more insult than apology, and you'll notice he doesn't apologize in the card at all.  Some part of me thinks that he doesn't quite believe his religion's claims of life after death.  Not really.  Not if he truly believes that this can make amends.  But even so, I haven't spent it, and I'm gonna give it back to him, and I'm gonna tell him why. ",
