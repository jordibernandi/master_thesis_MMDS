            "text": "Now, let me put this down.  I've looked at it.  What is the role of the Christian in academia and on university campuses?  The role of a Christian in academia is to be a Christian in academia.  And that means knowing how to put your head above the parapet.  That's true not only in academia but in the professions.  And we live in a politically correct generation where there's a great deal of fear out there.  And I understand it.  I've had pressure put on me.  And my heart goes out to academics, professional people who are so terrified, and I would say terrified, at being excluded by their colleagues that they've gone silent.  There are many silent Christians of the West, I fear.  They go to church, they say their prayers, they read their Bibles, but it's years since they witnessed to anybody.  It's not that they don't believe Christianity is true, it's they're scared to say it's true.  And I'd love to go into this in detail because it's very close to my heart, so close that I've just written a little book about it.  called Have No Fear.  It's the cheapest book you'll find on Amazon, especially if you buy 100 of them to give away.  Have no fear, because fear and shame are paralyzing people.  Now, I'm not talking at you, because I don't know anybody except liars who don't get scared.  We all have a level of fear.  And battling the fear of beginning to put our head cautiously above the parapet.  And we have to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.  It applies to all of us, not just to academics.  But academics come in for a lot of flak these days in the Western world.  Tragically, we built up universities to protect freedom of speech and ideas.  And some of them are now becoming hotbeds of political correctness and non-platforming and stopping people spread rational ideas for discussion.  That's appalling, and it's inhibiting human development and flourishing and freedom of speech and it will destroy society at the end.  if it goes on at the rate it's going.  That's a huge topic. ",
