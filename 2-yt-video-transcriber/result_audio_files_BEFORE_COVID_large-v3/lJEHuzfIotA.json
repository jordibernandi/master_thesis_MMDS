            "text": "The Federal Reserve did another repo operation again on Friday.  That was four times that they dumped money billions of dollars into the inner lending market.  So if you missed it from the last video what this means is the banks at the end of the night sometimes find themselves short on cash and they go to this little inner lending market where they can lend where they can borrow money from other banks who have an excess of money on hand and And then they return it the next night or a couple days later.  It's a very short-term loan.  It's just for a bank that needs some quick cash.  Another bank's got a lot more cash.  They kind of do this little deal, and then that's it.  Well, they've found themselves dry without any money in this lending market.  And banks that were in need of money were like, oh my gosh, where's the money?  There's no money.  And the only money that's available has an extremely high interest rate.  So the Fed stepped in and they dumped a bunch of money into this lending market.  It was unprecedented for them to do it once.  Then they did it again.  And then they did it again.  And that was the last video I did.  But guess what?  They did it again.  They did it four times last week.  But it gets better.  They then quietly announced on Friday, after they lowered the interest rate, they quietly announced that they will be dumping $75 billion every single weekday until October 10th into the little inner lending market.  Yeah.  So it wasn't just once.  It wasn't just twice.  It wasn't just four times.  No, they're going to do it for the next two weeks straight.  So the big question many of us have is where's the money, guys?  The banks are saying that they're loaded.  The banks say that they've got lots and lots of money, that they're more profitable than they've ever been, even though the rest of America is still suffering and trying to recover from the recession.  But the banks aren't, except the banks somehow find themselves short on cash.  So they're so short on cash that the Fed now has to dump this money into this interlending market for the next two weeks.  Um, another frustrating thing about this.  Now I've been doing a lot of research on the whole entire system.  And I am at this point, I was largely suspicious back in probably April or May.  I started to with, you know, I do a lot of research for my shows and whatnot.  And I started to get this inkling suspicion that the banks, um, Like, look, we can say a lot of things are the root of the problem.  We could say it's money in politics.  We could say that it's the military-industrial complex.  We could say that it's, you know, there's a variety of corrupt politicians, whatever it is, career politicians or electoral\u2014whatever you want to blame it on.  A lot of people want to blame the terrible\u2014 the discrepancies with wealth and kind of the shit that hits the fan all the time.  They want to blame it on all these variety of things.  I think it's I really think the root of all evil comes down to the banking system and the way the banking system is set up.  Or maybe it's banking in general.  I haven't quite wrapped myself fully around that, but I am.  I've been researching a lot on it.  I'm closer to putting all the pieces together as to why.  And the bigger question, what would fix it?  When I do figure that out... Because it's so much information, I'm realizing that it's going to have to be a series of videos that I put out.  I know in other times when I've researched, done in-depth research on certain topics, I could do maybe a half hour video on it and at least paint the picture.  But with this, it's so big, guys, I would have to do a series of videos, which I hope I will be able to do in the next probably few months.  Honestly, it's just so much to wrap around.  But you know, one thing, one question I have with this repo, A little inner lending market.  Question I have is, you know, why is it when you and I are short on cash, if we need quick money, we got to go to like the lending tree or someplace like that, right?  And the interest rate for those loans is outrageous.  Yet banks get to go and lend money to one another for a 2% annual interest rate.  So it's very little that they end up having to pay back.  when they do pay the money back.  Also, we don't, as the average person, the thing that bothers me a lot about the system and what's going on with the Fed dumping money into it is you and I, when we're short on cash and we're thinking, oh, geez, you know, I really would like to spend money on some investments and buy some things like the way a bank does, but I don't have any money.  It would be really nice if all of a sudden I could turn to the Fed and say, hey, guys, I need some cash.  Dump it my way.  Just dump it.  Pad my account.  Pad my account.  I'm going to go invest it.  I'll give it back after I invest it and make a bunch of money.  You and I don't get that luxury, but the banks do.  That's a huge problem.  So that's what's going on there.  Sounding the alarm bells with the economy.  Something just isn't right.  If they are dumping this much money into this interlending system, if the banks have run dry and they're not willing or able to lend to one another quickly overnight, that's problematic.  The fact that they're now going to do it for the next two weeks is extremely problematic, guys.  So keep your eyes open.  Thank you so much for watching.  I do appreciate your support for this show.
