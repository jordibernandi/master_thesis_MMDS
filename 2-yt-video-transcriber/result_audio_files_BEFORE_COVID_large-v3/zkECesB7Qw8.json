And I was recently sent a link to a blog and a link to a couple of audio and video clips in a kind of unique case.  There's a Canada-wide arrest warrant for this individual's arrest, and the audio recording I was sent is a confession from his accuser in which she admits that she lied to police, and a little bit more, which I'll share with you very soon.  According to the blog, he goes by the name Alex.  It's his middle name, so that's what I'm gonna call him in this video.  Additionally, there's video of the same woman who's accusing Alex in which she's creating fake bruises that she's planning on falsely accusing the police with themselves.  This is the woman laughing maniacally while making fake bruises on her wrists with crayon.  Crayon.  So even if the police don't care about the truth and there weren't on Alex, they should care about the fact the same woman is trying to set the police up themselves. ",

To make it look like the cops abused her even more than she already was.  Or if she was, I don't know.  But she's putting fake bruises on herself.  Making up stories that I abused her.

And this is how close and buddy-buddy she is with the guy she's alleging has committed a number of assaults and a rape against her.  We'll get to the confession on that shortly.  The blog shows multiple emails that were also sent from this woman after she made these allegations in which she's saying, oh, where are you at?  Why aren't you talking to me on social media anymore?  And she's actively pursuing and then issuing some threats towards him.  I won't bother with the screenshots of that.  But I have seen those as well.  She's actually trying to bully the guy into maintaining a relationship.  And in her confession, She explains a little bit as one of her two motives for making this lie that she doesn't want him to move on and have another relationship.  So let's look at the first motive.  In this case, the woman needs to move back in with her mother and her mother has told her that she has to go to police and make this false accusation if she wants to live at home again. ",
