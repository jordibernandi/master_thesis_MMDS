And in fact, you'll probably recall that the Prime Minister made a speech in January of 2017 at Lancaster House, which was probably the best speech that she's made on the issue of Brexit, in which she spelled out a vision of a free trade agreement, of a good relationship with the European Union that wouldn't impede our trade and good relations with the rest of the world.

It's not the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, who confessed in November he... hadn't quite understood how reliant UK trade in goods is on Dover Cali.  It's always those pesky Europeans.  Leavers told us EU countries would fall out during negotiations and succumb to leave demands or even recently give in at the 11th hour.  They haven't, have they?
