So if you're interested in getting some of these products or checking out the discounts on my website, please check the link in the description.  The website is www.preparewithcc.com.  Okay, so onto the haul.  So I'll do the maternity stuff first because the baby stuff is so cute.  It's kind of like, we'll leave it as a grand finale.  So basically, I don't like maternity jeans.  They're uncomfortable.  They fit in some places and they don't fit in others.  I feel like... They kind of slide down when you walk around in them.  I mean, I like how they look.  They look fine.  It's just, it's not for me.  I want to be comfortable.  I want to wear something that's going to be form-fitting, gonna make me feel warm and comfy and cozy.  but that's also, it has give and stretch in them.  So leggings are the way to go for me.  I hear a lot of women are one or the other, they like their leggings for their entire pregnancy or they like jeans.  I am a leggings girl, so from Old Navy, I got two pairs of leggings.  these are thick.  they're like.  they're not a jersey or like just plain cotton material.  they're.  they're spandexy and they're very very thick.  you can see there's like a beautiful seam that goes down the front which almost makes them look like a dress pant which i really like.  um they're.  they're a skinny fit so easy to tuck into winter boots and they have the elasticated over the bump stretchy part on the top which is thinner and not as thick as the actual pant itself.  so it won't be providing too much support around your belly.  but you don't really want things to be like super super tight around your your belly where your baby is anyway at least in my opinion.  so I got these in the heather gray as well as in black.  I haven't even taken the black out of the package yet but I'll just show you real quick.  They're exactly the same, you know?  So yeah, they've got like the over the bump, elasticated fit, beautiful seam down the front, skinny fit, and they're thick, which is great for winter.  So these will be my winter leggings that I will be basically wearing and circulating with, I think I have one or two other pairs of leggings that I can wear.  I have like a merino wool under armor that I can wear even under those to make them even more warm.  So pretty much all of my shirts I will be able to wear with these two warm pairs of leggings and it will match and it will be comfy, but it will feel like I have a lot more clothes and more outfits than if I had bought like five pairs of maternity pants.  Those pants were like, they were less than $20 each.  They were a really, really good deal.  So the first thing I got is a really simple, basic black scoop neck.  It's exactly the same as what I'm wearing right now.  This is a V-neck, but I got it secondhand at the maternity store in my shop.  It has the ruching on the side, so it shows off your bump.  It's just a perfect basic.  I wanted it in a scoop neck as well as having the black V-neck.  And this was less than $10.  Just a really simple basic.  So as well as that one, the only other shirt that I got, which shows off the bump, is this one, which is a really beautiful mustardy color shirt.  It has the tie in the front, which is great for nursing.  So you know, you can just kind of I will be covering myself probably.  no definitely when I'm in public but when I'm at home you can just untie the side and then you can easily nurse.  I'll just kind of show you really quickly what this one looks like on.  it's such a beautiful color.  I really love jewel tones just for any time of the year.  really so as you can see like it's it's it's got lots of room for growth.  So you don't know how big I'm going to get, but it's certainly not baggy by anyone's standards.  And then it just sort of comes down over the bump and it has the ruching here on the side, which is really cute.  And it's just like a really nice color.  I really love it.  I think it's really nice.  And, you know, when you're pregnant and your body's changing, it can be a little bit alarming at first.  Nothing fits.  You know, nothing's really comfortable.  I just think it's really nice to invest in a few little pieces that you can throw on that make you feel cute and girly.  Because most of the time around the house these days, it's just like hashtag blob life.  And yeah, I just think that that's so cute.  And I got.  I got I think 60% off.  I think this was actually.  this is still on the Old Navy website Canada right now.  it's comes in like black and white.  pink and just like a solid black navy, which is really cute.  So then my other three shirts are more of a relaxed fit.  They kind of graze over the body.  They go well over the bump and almost cover my bum entirely, which is, this is like, this is my ideal and preferred fit for pregnancy.  You still will easily be able to see my bump through a shirt like this, but I think the stripe mustard is just like a perfect basic can wear it with a pair of leggings and a pair of winter boots and a scarf and it will look really cute and casual and it will also be really comfy because it's not form-fitting.  it's not like hugging my body super tight and I love that.  I just think it's a beautiful basic and you know I like they're a relaxed fit shirt anyway like I will probably definitely wear this when I'm not pregnant anymore just like as a baggy cozy shirt The second shirt that I got, which is basically exactly like that one.  Another relaxed fit tunic.  It's quite long, should come down over my bum.  Nice long sleeves and a scoop neck in this beautiful cranberry color, which I think is just, it's a color that suits me.  It's one of these jewel tones that I just gravitate towards.  It's really pretty, really feminine and very comfy.  Easily will be able to be worn after pregnancy because it doesn't have the side ruching.  It's literally just a relaxed fit tunic that will go over the bump, which I'm all about, you know, buying pieces which are theoretically wearable after pregnancy.  That's why I only got, I have three of these shirts, which have the ruching on the side, the polka dot one and these two black sort of t-shirt style ones, because I just don't, I don't feel like spending a load of money on something that I don't know.  I'm not going to be wearing that much.  I mean, I'm going to be pregnant again, but I don't know.  How much actual bump-related clothing do you need?  Anyway.  So this one is the thicker, it's the thickest of the shirts that I bought.  It's actually more of a sweater material.  It's very, very soft, but it doesn't seem like one of those materials that will go nibby, you know, in the wash, which I absolutely hate.  And I'll just try this one on for you as well so you can see.  This one has a little bit of shape to it as well.  It's not just like a tunic.  It has an elastic around the bust, which is really nice because... All you pregnant ladies know out there, you don't really have much of a shape in the way that you used to when you get pregnant.  So this is nice, it just cuts into the smallest part of you, which for most women will now be directly under the waist.  Gives you a little bit of shape.  It's like a peplum style, so it kind of like, you know, comes out like an A-line.  Long sleeve, scoop neck, really soft.  I'm actually just gonna keep this on because it's so nice.  Okay, so now onto the fun stuff, which is the baby-related clothes.  So we'll start off with the smallest item here.  These were like $6 on sale as well.  Everything that I'm showing you right now, I'm pretty sure it's still on the website and it's still on sale.  These slippers have these little tiny things on the bottom and they're so soft and fleecy and warm on the inside.  Extremely cute, just in a navy.  And I bought these in a... three to six months, because they're elasticated around the ankle, meaning they'll probably still fit him when he's an infant.  There'll be a lot of extra room in the toe.  And he'll grow into them.  I don't see the point in buying tons of infant... sizing clothes and articles of clothing because he's just gonna grow out of it in a month.  anyway.  I'd rather buy things that are functional and practical and maybe he can wear a little bit big in the beginning and then grow into grow into.  so I think you know this will probably last at least until six months.  they're kind of big and stretchy.  so You know, maybe even a bit longer.  Great deal on those.  And so those sorts of, that slipper, the reason why I bought those slippers is because some of the jumpers that I got, they don't have feet.  So I just wanted something that I can pop on his feet that's thicker than a sock in case it's cold.  So the first cute thing that I got... this like so this is a zero two or no sorry a three to six month 12 to 17 pound onesie very very cute has no feet but it has a diagonal zipper down the front for easy changing.  so you know you can theoretically just keep his arms in the top part and just sort of change his diaper and then, you know, pop him back in.  What's really cute about this is that the dinosaur is a bit textured.  He almost has kind of like a rubber feel.  And if you lift up his mouth, he's like, hi, really, really cute.  It also has a hood, which I love.  I love the hood option and it's super fleecy and soft on the inside.  So he won't fit into that right away, but he will eventually, he will, he will work his way into it as he grows.  So the other, Is this one?  No, so this one is 6 to 12 months.  This one's bigger again.  Also dinosaur themed.  It has kind of like a grey scaly pattern on the bottom.  But on the hood there are these like black scales.  Absolutely adorable.  I love this.  I can't wait to see him like stomping around the house.  Roaring and pretending to be a dino.  As long as he doesn't transition to a dino, we're good.  It's also fleecy on the inside.  It has the diagonal zip for easy changing, or if he gets warm, he can easily strip off.  No feet again, so probably will be good at least in the beginning for the six month period if he fits into them with the slippers.  This one is my favorite.  I am obsessed with this one.  It is so adorable.  It's just like the dinosaur one, only it's a fox.  Look at it.  look how adorable it is and like.  this is a really high quality piece of fabric like.  it's not cheap.  it doesn't look like it's sewn together cheaply.  it's extremely soft and warm on the inside.  the zipper looks great.  the design is beautiful like.  i'm really surprised with old navy.  to be honest like the last time i bought something from old navy it was like junk.  but this I'm really impressed with.  I'm really happy with them.  they're super cute super soft and everything that I've heard moms talk about online.  they're like get the diagonal zip.  it's the easiest.  you don't have to like take anything off over their head when you're changing them and it's sort of you think and they can unzip it.  they can.  they can sort of strip off quickly if they're overheating that kind of a thing.  but I mean like.  I got this for like $15.  I think it was regular 40 adorable right Um, and then so I got two more three to six month.  This was a two pack.  I think I got both of these for $17 together.  It's a slightly different style.  It also has a hood.  All of my three to 12 month onesies, except for a few that I've purchased in other places have hoods.  I just really like the hood option to keep their head warm if they feel a bit chilly.  This one doesn't have a zip.  It has the snaps just on the bottom.  Which I think is fine.  You know, as long as, like I said, it doesn't have to go over his head to be changed.  It's perfect.  It's just like a regular stripey, footless onesie.  Perfect.  And then another dinosaur.  I don't know what's going on.  I was kind of like, I guess I was having like a dinosaur moment when I was shopping that day.  But... this is really cool pattern.  it has like stegosaurus it has long neck it looks like it has some raptors and this one has the snaps on the bottom for easy changing and a hood super cute.  it's a lighter material a little bit thicker than t-shirt but like definitely feels like it's like not a cheap like cheap piece of clothing which i like.  and then the cutest my favorite part is the infant onesies.  so none of these have hoods but they're just really simple really soft.  i was going for comfort and warmth when i bought these ones.  these were like six dollars each.  they were really really good price.  um and yeah zipper diagonal zipper down the front feet no hood.  so super comfy.  you can sleep in them if he wants to.  soft warm neutral perfect this one.  oh honestly I wish I had this for me like I want this in my size.  it's so soft it's so beautiful like the velour is.  it's really nice has a nice little shine on it star pattern and zip with feet.  super cute.  I cannot wait to cuddle him when he's all wrapped up and cozy in this one when he's like a little baby so awesome.  And then this one is another like really neutral, it's slightly thicker than the initial zero to three month baby jumper that I showed you.  This one's quilted.  So just a tiny bit thicker, but also like a nice neutral navy.  You can pop a hat on him, an extra sweater over the top if we're going outside.  It's just simple.  Love it.  And then the last one that I got also on the theme of dinosaurs, as you can see here, the feet have like little dinosaur faces, which I thought was just adorable.  And it kind of has like a cool green dinosaur face.  vibe to it again with the zip no hood.  this was just a t-shirt material sort of a lighter option in case there's a warm day or in case we have the fire going and it's warm in the house.  and yeah this one was also under $10.  so yeah this was a super successful haul.  I'm super pleased with everything that I got for myself.  everything fits really nice.  uh i i went just just so.  you know if you're a pregnant woman watching this i am normally a size small on top but because i'm just kind of like worried all the time when i shop online i always almost always go with size up and i almost never regret it.  um you can kind of see my size here now you know like i'm not like a big girl.  um and i got a medium and it fits me comfortably like it fits me in the shoulders it fits me in the arm.  It's not baggy around the waist or anything.  I think a small still probably would have fit, but like I said, I'm going for comfort these days, so a medium was great for me in the leggings and in the tunics.  And yeah, the baby clothes is super awesome.  So I hope you enjoyed this haul.  Check out the Old Navy website if you're Canadian.  I think they probably have the deals on the American site too, but I was just on the website before I made this video and the deals are definitely still on right now.
