            "text": "Hark!  Look what just arrived by Jeff Bezos.  Your tip was me to me, Jeff.  Hmm, what do we have here?  A book.  A book.  When Christians Break Bread.  No, When Christians Break Bad.  Now, as America's best Christian, trademark Lori, Amazon sends me every book with the word Christian on the cover.  I just realized that must be why I have the largest collection of hands.  Christian Anderson for resale on eBay.  When Christians break bad.  Not another romantic play about an evangelical meth lab.  I couldn't even finish Crystal Cathedral.  No, worse.  This is written by that Bonnie Weinstein gal.  She's with the Military Religious Freedom Foundation.  For those of you who don't know, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation is a thorn in the side of all of us who try to turn the U.S.  military into a recruitment camp for ultra right-wing Christianity.  Ooh-foo-ooh, busybodies.  If you ask me, using tax dollars to market our religion over all others really puts the fun in fundamentalism.  But every time we try to indoctrinate our armed forces into the dominionist lifestyle, along comes the Military Religious Freedom Foundation waving that pesky Constitution in our faces.  Some constitutional claptrap about separating church and state.  Well, I have news for the Military Religious Freedom Foundation.  If evangelicals don't pay attention to anything Jesus ever said, we certainly aren't going to start paying attention to anything the Founding Fathers suggested either.  Now, what are those Constitution junkies at the Military Religious Freedom Foundation up to?  Letters from the insane, inane, and profane.  Credit where due.  Even Satan knows how to use an Oxford comma.  Okay, this book appears to be an annotated compendium of actual letters sent to the Military Religious Freedom Foundation.  What a sneaky way to make evangelicals look bad.  Using real letters?  From us.  Truly, is there anything more vicious to do to evangelicals than repeating what evangelicals actually say?  Case in point, page 39.  Subject.  Un-Christian word off, Mikey.  He's the gentleman married to the author who runs MRFF.  M-R-F-F.  Mikey's retarded... F-word.  No, not that one.  Federation.  Federation.  Mikey is the king, unchristian word that rhymes with rich, and the organization is filled with a bunch of anal butt monkeys who swallow each other's loads while wearing camo fatigues and high heels.  Unchristian word off.  Odd, isn't it, how men who claim to loathe homosexual sex spend the most time thinking about its particulars.  Maybe this is a better example of Christian love.  Ha!  Your wife deserves to be a cripple.  And we of the Lord pray.  you have a brain hemorrhage where your eyes pop out and your, un-Christian word, Jew blood streams out of your ears.  Charmed, I'm sure.  You know, there seems to be a lot of evangelicals in here demeaning Jews with some rather colorful language.  I'm seeing that vile K-word.  Not Kardashian.  Alarmingly often, Hating Jews seems an odd choice when the person you're counting on to get you into heaven is one.  Am I right, Jesus?  Goodness, goodness, that's tacky.  That's really tacky.  How shocking.  That's not how you spell that.  Do what?  To where?  Is that even possible?  I guess it is, yes.  Oh, now this one is actually pretty hilarious.  But it's obscene.  Let me read it again.  Ooh.  I have to say, I cannot recommend this shocking book.  Yes, it is rather entertaining and certainly illuminating about the crazy dark forces afoot in this country, but I haven't seen anything that makes evangelicals look this bad since the last time Jerry Falwell opened his mouth.  This book, When Christians Break Bad, is filled with outrageously colorful, obscene rantings of actual evangelicals.  Goodness, this book is so full of sex and violence, it may as well be on Netflix.  But it is not fit for a Christian home.  It is so salacious and pornographic.  Well, not as salacious and pornographic as the Bible.  But then again, what book is?  Still, don't buy When Christians Break Bad. ",
