            "text": "Don't praise individuals for being good looking or dislike people because of their appearance.  A bee is small compared to other creatures that fly, but it produces the sweetest of all things.  Don't brag about wearing fine clothes and don't get carried away when you are honored.  The things the Most High YAH has done are amazing.  The things he has done have been hidden from mortals.  Many kings have been left with nothing while the least likely people have worn their crowns.  Many rulers have been completely disgraced and many honored leaders have surrendered to other leaders.  Don't blame anyone before you examine the evidence.  Examine first and then criticize.  Don't answer before you listen and don't interrupt when someone is speaking.  Don't argue about something that does not concern you and don't join sinners when they judge a case.  My child, don't get involved in too many things.  If you increase your activities, you're going to suffer.  If you pursue them, you won't catch up to them.  And by running away, you won't escape them.  Some people work hard, struggle, and are always in a hurry, but they still fall behind.  Other people are slow and need help.  They lack strength and live in poverty, but the Most High YAH is looking out for them.  He pulls them out of their miserable condition.  He honors them to the amazement of many people.  Good and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth come from the Most High YAH.  The Most High Yah's gifts remain with devout people.  His favor brings lasting success.  A person can become rich by being cautious and pinching pennies, but this is the reward he will receive.  When he says, I can finally relax and enjoy what I worked for.  He doesn't not know how long he has before he will die and leave his wealth to others.  Keep your agreements, keep yourself busy with them, and grow old while you fulfill them.  Don't be amazed at what sinners do.  Instead, trust the Most High YAH and keep working.  The Most High YAH can easily make a poor person instantly rich.  His blessings reward devout people, and he makes his blessings develop quickly.  Don't say, I don't need anything and what good can the future bring?  Also don't say, I have everything I need and what harm can the future bring?  Hardships are forgotten during good times.  Good things are not remembered during bad times.  When people die, the most Hayah can easily reward them based on the way they lived.  An hour of misery makes one forget sweet memories.  When life ends, everything a person has done is revealed.  Don't consider anyone fortunate before he dies.  A person will be known by the children he leaves.  Be cautious of the people you invite into your home because devious people know many tricks.  An arrogant person's intellect is like a spy who looks for your weak point.  He waits for an opportunity to turn good into evil and to find fault with anything noble.  A spark can start many coals on fire.  A sinner awaits an ambush to shed blood.  Beware of criminals because they devise evil schemes and can ruin your reputation forever.  If you allow a stranger into your home, he will cause you trouble.  He will make you a stranger to your own family. ",
