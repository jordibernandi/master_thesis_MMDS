            "text": "How's the royal family?  I pray that everyone is doing well.  Well, my royal family, I've just seen a very passionate, passionate video on Lisa Cabrera's channel that needs way more attention.  this is one of these videos where i feel like in the black youtube community.  we all need to play.  so what i will do?  i'm going to put the link to lisa cabrera's video because i want people to go over there and listen to what lisa had to say and this is about a lady I never knew nothing about.  Her name is Stephanie Flowers.  And what I found out about her is Stephanie.  Ann Flowers is an African American attorney, Democratic politician, serving since 2011 in the Arkansas State Senate.  Flowers started in politics when elected in 2004, ironic, to the district 17th seat in Arkansas's House of Representatives.  And that's ironic because y'all know what the number 17 means, overcoming the enemy.  And she stirred some folks up.  So when me and my husband was watching this video about an hour ago, we were floored.  I was like, whoa, whoa, this sister.  When I say she bring it, she was bringing it.  She was bringing it.  She was bringing it.  She was bringing it.  And she speaks volumes, volumes how we really feel about this motherfucking system and about the motherfucking enemy and how everything is business as usual.  And they expect... black politicians of the unquote coon caucus to conform to their fuckery.  And so we're going to hear our queen bring it because homeboy thought he was going to check her.  Well, she checked him.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't he feel some kind of way?  And I said, no, I got to go deeper.  So I'm famous for digging up stuff and I found the full video.  Oh yeah, and it's sweet.  Oh, it's sweet.  That's one of them.  videos.  That's one of them.  That's one of them.  Stop everything you're doing.  I'm putting a whole lot on it.  So let's go over here because I already got it, you know, posted up where I usually post up stuff when I'm doing my thug fizzle.  And we got six minutes of power.  You act a fool.  Oh yeah, you on one.  Let's see if we can get it.  You know retrograde like whooping on my ass.  Oh, here we go with this crap.  Oops.  We gonna get it.  Let me refresh it.  See what we got going. ",

And I know that the enemy comes on this channel and listen to us and y'all make a joke out of the things that we say.  I cannot convey to y'all how done we are.  It's just like the brother the other day when all those cops came and he's simply picking up trash and they holding on their guns and they holding on their tasers.  It's like you have no fucking common sense.  And for a lady her age, because let me see here with Miss Flowers, 65 years old, she just tired of sitting there listening to the rhetoric, go alone, get alone, while the enemy impose their will on us.  And I pray that you're listening to me.  Because I ain't never been afraid to speak to you.  I was raised by the right type of people.  But we done.  We done with all of this.  We done with the rhetoric.  We done with the bullshit.  We done with the games.  And all the games that you're playing right now when we're speaking about what is owed to us.  What is due to us.  Y'all gonna see something up in us y'all ain't never ever ever seen before.  Because we out of our captivity.  And we know who we backed by.  We know our lineage.  Many of us know it.  And many of us is waking up.  And we done with this whole motherfucking system.  We have demonstrated, and I've said it often, on the four corners of the earth who we are.  We have showed compassion.  We have tried to get along with the enemy.  They don't want to get along.  They want to double down with their rhetoric and their bullshit.  We know what's going on.  We see very clearly and we tired of your motherfuckers.  Do you hear me?  We tired of your motherfuckers.  So I have to back up somebody like this.  I couldn't, there was no way, as hard as this woman was speaking, that I said, I can't dismiss this.  I have to see who this woman is.  This is my hero.  And there's many others.  There's many others.  Well, she just said it was just that one day, that one day where enough was enough was enough.  And then a motherfucker going to tell her what she need to do.  And she like, you're going to shoot me.  You didn't did everything to me.  You didn't did everything to the royal family.  So as y'all play your games and try to shut us down alone, with the enemy supporters, you will feel.  I have spoke this into the universe like many, like many.  I'm that kind of powerful.  I know who I am.  It has been revealed to me.  And as many of me that's tired of your motherfuckers.  And there's nothing you can do to shut our voices down.  There's nothing you can do.  There's nothing you can do.  You think I speak hard.  You ain't really heard me.  Because I had to taper it down because I'm on the enemy's platform.  But not for long.  Because there's only so much you can do to the royal family.  But we tired of y'all.  We tired of y'all dusty motherfuckers.  And I'll leave it right there.  I want the royal family to go over and listen to what Lisa Cabrera have to say.  The link will be there.  I want y'all to look her up yourself.  But we are done.  You hear me, motherfuckers?  Fuck you and fuck everything about you.  And I'm saying it to the depths of my soul.  So my royal family, render your voice with your beautiful divine words.  And as always, my royal family, I thank you for your love.  I thank you for your support.  And with that said, Ashe, I love you, my queen.  I love you. ",
