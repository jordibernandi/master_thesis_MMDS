            "text": "In one of my last videos, I mentioned that Nine Inch Nails had been a favorite band of mine when I was younger and how I came to the conclusion that the purpose of this music was to excite me and to wear down my tolerance to degeneracy and even to promote the nihilism that's pretty much a plague on Generation X in the same way that idealism is to the boomers.  And that the purpose of this music was to eventually push me as far away from God as possible.  And I didn't spend too much time going into detail about the music itself because I assumed what I was saying was self-evident.  And I was genuinely surprised by how many messages I got from people saying stuff like, well, Nine Inch Nails, it's good.  There's a dark beauty to it.  I think you're wrong.  I like listening to it.  And it really illustrated to me that the hold that this kind of music has on people, people that like my content and can see the degeneracy in films and other media, At the same time, they'll make excuses for music because they like it.  Because they want to listen to it.  As if the films I dissect aren't loved by audiences everywhere.  By millions of people.  And it's funny because it's almost as if they don't understand that liking it is part of the problem.  If the music was terrible and nobody wanted to listen to it, it would be a non-issue.  I mean, understand that you really don't sound much different than a heroin addict that when told to quit says, but I like it.  I like the way it makes me feel.  And you gotta understand, I like it too.  I bought several Nine Inch Nails albums over the years, and even now, when I hear a song, it elicits a kind of forced nostalgia, but... It's taken me time and reflection to understand that this nostalgia is pathetic.  Years ago, I worked as a technical director for a morning news show, and during the broadcast, we had to wear headsets.  So I could tell people when to roll different tapes or to turn microphones on and off or adjust cameras and what have you.  When things were slow, we would chat on the headsets, and in a lot of ways, it was kind of like being stuck on an elevator talking to people that you wouldn't talk to otherwise.  One of those people was the sound engineer.  He was this self-proclaimed born-again Christian, a born-again Christian that I witnessed doing what many Christians do, and that was inadvertently recruiting for the other side by setting a bad example.  I say this because of the way that he acted.  It was very obnoxious how pious he was, and it was very off-putting.  But the one thing that really stuck out, and I've seen this millions of times in people just like him, he couldn't stop talking about how bad he used to be.  He did this weird kind of bragging where he would tell us how good he was now, but at the same time still brag about how bad he used to be.  For instance, if the crew started talking about how we were going to go get drinks after the show, he would inject himself into the conversation, even though there's no way he was going to be invited anyway.  He would need to tell us.  that he couldn't come and then talk about how, you know, even though he doesn't drink now, oh boy, he used to drink.  He used to drink so much.  Wow, it was a miracle.  he didn't die.  Man, if you could have seen him back then, you wouldn't believe how much he used to drink, but not anymore.  No, no, he learned his lesson.  Now he was a good Christian and we were all sinners.  And I couldn't help but get the sense that he was still stuck thinking that being a party animal was cool.  And he had to flex and tell everyone how much of a party animal he used to be.  And he could be now if he wanted to.  To try to establish some position in the social hierarchy or something.  It bothered me because it seemed as though if he was really... a born again Christian, that these stories wouldn't be something that he would be proud of.  There were stories he'd be ashamed of.  He wouldn't be so braggadocious and talking about these tales of the glory days.  And what made it worse was I highly suspected he was exaggerating most of the stories.  Now, as a side note, I just want to let some people out there that might not know this.  It's Christians like this that really push people away from God.  These people don't just look ridiculous, like hypocrites.  The sin of pride painted all over their face so everyone can see it but them because they avoid looking into mirrors like vampires.  But they make Christianity look like some kind of disingenuous, pompous form of virtue signaling.  And nothing more.  Because I think for him, that's probably what it was.  And it's his face that I think of when I catch myself being nostalgic about these times.  When I hear this music and I start thinking about how cool.  I thought I was drinking myself half to death and doing other things that would have ruined or even ended my life.  And that did set my life back significantly.  But that's the power and the magic of music.  It does cause these forced feelings of nostalgia.  It's against your will almost.  But that's not all it's doing.  It's activating parts of the brain that were developing the first time you heard it.  And it can put you in that same mindset.  That's the power of that.  this music wouldn't have if you didn't like it.  So saying that you like it or even that you like the way it makes you feel is literally the same as a heroin addict using that same reasoning and even wording as an excuse to not quit.  It's nonsense.  I liked the music too.  I still, on a level, like it.  I like the way it sounds.  I would probably also like heroin.  If all I did was act on the animal part of my brain based on what I liked, I would probably just shoot heroin all day while eating cheesecake, listening to Nine Inch Nails as I played video games and got blowjobs from hookers.  Liking things is an absurd standard to base your behavior on.  So let's take a closer look at what some of these people like so much.  You know, scientists can examine the chemicals inside heroin and observe the damage that it does to your brain and your body.  Let's take a look at the contents of nine inch nails.  So here's some of the lyrics from the first album, Pretty Hate Machine.  Hey God, why are you doing this to me?  Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?  Why am I seething with animosity?  Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology.  Terrible lie.  Obviously the implication that God has lied to him.  The next verse.  Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide.  I lost my ignorance, security, and pride.  I'm all alone in a world you must despise.  Hey God, I believed your promises.  Your promises were lies.  It's not even symbolism.  He's spelling it out.  We'll go through more albums and lyrics, but right there, right off the bat, we see that this theme... is what is repeated over and over and over in Trent Reznor's music.  Over and over and over into the minds of people, mostly in Generation X. Choreographed to catchy sounds that are anything but uplifting.  God is a lie.  God is a lie.  That's the message from Trent Reznor.  The world is shit.  God is a lie.  Do whatever feels good.  Do whatever you like.  Here's another song.  Heaven's just a rumor she dispels as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell.  I still dream of lips I never should have kissed.  Well, she knows exactly what I can't resist.  Once again, God is a lie.  The world is shit.  So let's just fuck like animals and enjoy animal pleasures because everything else is meaningless.  This is literally satanic.  You understand that, right?  It's not tangentially satanic.  This is what is taught at the satanic church.  Here's another song.  I can't shake this feeling from my head.  There's a devil sleeping in my bed.  He's watching you from across the way.  I cannot make this feeling go away.  And then the chorus.  I know it's not the right thing.  I know it's not the good thing.  Kinda I want to.  The message is clear.  The devil is telling him to just do what feels good.  And even though he knows it's wrong, he's going to do it anyway because it's what he wants to do.  It's what he likes.  Do what thou wilt.  The more we look at these lyrics, the more it becomes obvious why the real diehard fans of this music might not want to give it up.  They know it's wrong, but they want to.  And Trent Reznor has been telling them over and over and over and over again in their head.  That's all the justification you need.  So now let's take a look at the second album, Broken.  That's the one I was talking specifically about in the video that seemed to bother so many Nine Inch Nails fans.  This is the first day of my last days.  I built it up, now I take it apart, climbed up real high, now fall down real far.  No need for me to stay.  The last thing left, I just threw it away.  I put my faith in God and my trust in you.  Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do.  Once again, this isn't hidden symbolism.  This isn't hard to decipher.  The people listening are just so desensitized by the repeated degeneracy.  That they just make excuses for these lyrics because they like the music.  They like the way it makes them feel.  The same way a heroin addict makes excuses for why their life is a mess and justifies it all because they like the way it makes them feel.  Here's another one.  There is no God up in the sky tonight.  No sign of heaven anywhere in sight.  All that was true is left behind.  Once I could see, now I am blind.  Don't want your dreams you try to sell.  This disease I give to myself.  Once again, he's telling you everything.  In this song, he's even telling you That you're the one doing it to yourself.  It's amazing to me that I even have to explain a message this explicit.  But at the same time, I understand.  I understand because I like the way this music sounds.  I do.  But that's not a good enough reason to put poison into my brain.  Because just like a drug, it might make me feel good in the moment.  But what kind of damage are these messages doing to you in the long term?  Even if you're an atheist, these are not uplifting songs.  They're specifically designed to promote nihilism and despair.  This isn't rocket scientist.  This isn't symbolism.  This is literal.  If you listen to a tape on repeat that just told you over and over again, you're shit, you're shit, the world is shit.  There's no God.  We're all just monkeys.  And you listen to that tape on repeat, or I'm sorry, MP3 on repeat.  How is that going to affect the way you view the world?  How is that going to affect your actions?  In the downward spiral, the album opens up with Trent Reznor literally agreeing with everything I just said.  Okay, here it goes.  I am the voice inside your head and I control you.  I am the lover in your bed and I control you.  I am the sex that you provide and I control you.  I am the hate you try to hide and I control you.  I take you where you want to go.  I give you all you need to know.  I drag you down.  I use you up.  Mr.  Self-destruct.  The next verse, I speak religion's message clear and I control you.  I am denial, guilt and fear and I control you.  I am the prayers of the naive and I control you.  I am the lie that you believe and I control you.  Again, explicitly telling you that God is a lie, God is a lie.  I'm bringing you down and I'm controlling you.  It's song after song of Trent Reznor spelling out exactly what he's doing.  The next song on the album is literally called Heresy.  He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see.  He tries to tell me what I put inside of me.  He's got the answers to ease my curiosity.  He dreamed a God up and called it Christianity.  Followed by the chorus, God is dead and no one cares.  If there is a hell, I'll see you there.  Can you get any more explicit than that?  If you want to know how we got to this place in our history, And in our culture, it's because people, myself included, by the way, accepted this as part of the culture.  As a norm.  Because we liked it.  And as I said before, liking something is a terrible standard for determining what your behavior should be.  If liking something is the standard that you're using to determine what's acceptable... Then how are you going to explain to someone who likes trans kids, as an example, that it's wrong?  They like it.  It makes them feel good.  They're being consistent with your standards.  It makes them feel good.  Life is shit.  There is no God.  Just do whatever feels good.  Or to quote Nine Inch Nails, Kinda.  I want to.  Maybe just for tonight.  We can pretend it's alright.  What's the price I pay?  I don't care what they say.  I want to.
