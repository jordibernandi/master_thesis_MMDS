            "text": "Gentlemen, excellent to be back with you on MGTOW Money.  Today's topic, 63% of millennials regret this.  Before we get to that, thanks to the ongoing support from the Patreon investors in this channel, and thanks to the supporters who bought me a cup of coffee via PayPal, Bitcoin, based upon the last video.  Men, see the video description today.  Become a supporter of this channel.  On to today's topic.  63% of millennials regret this.  And before I get into today's topic, if you get any background noise, by the way, men, I am traveling over the next several weeks.  So just bear with me.  I got a pop quiz for you guys.  Ever done something you regret?  Well, 63% of millennials evidently regret this.  And by the way, look in the video description.  I'll include a link to this article that reflects this.  And, oh, I'm not talking about the 63% that regret getting married.  That's probably actually about 80%, especially if they're men.  Specifically, a lot of millennials regret purchasing a home, buying a home, buying some sort of residence.  And of course, why becomes sort of begs the question.  You know, this is quote, the American dream, right?  And of course, the sequence is you get a good job, you get married, and you buy a home.  And oh, of course, you'll end up with a happy life, right?  All right, well, again, according to this survey, one of the biggest reasons why so many millennials are unhappy about buying a home is is specifically unexpected expenses and maintenance,  etc.,  ongoing maintenance, and so on.  And speaking as a single man from my own personal circumstances for the past 25 years, I'm going to give you, my MGTOW brother, three specific reasons why you should not be... buying anything, and I'll include real estate, but do not buy anything that you cannot easily fit into the inside of your automobile.  Let me get into it.  One, your greatest asset, as I've mentioned in the past, is your mobility.  You can get up and move.  A MGTOW can move at will.  He can go anywhere.  He can do anything.  He has something called freedom.  He has flexibility.  He can go there, he can go somewhere else, or he doesn't have to go anywhere.  He can start a business, he can work a job, he can do neither and just choose to do something else.  Who knows?  He can do several gig economy type work,  etc.,  He doesn't have any sort of geographic constraints stopping him.  He doesn't have to negotiate with anyone.  He can move forward with his life as he chooses to.  Nothing is holding him back.  Two, specifically going back to real estate, this is one of the most illiquid investments or things of any type material possessions that you can buy.  what i mean by illiquid is that it is easy to buy but frankly many times it is hard to sell.  in other words you're going to let's hypothetically say i'm just using round numbers you buy a house for a hundred thousand dollars and you want to turn around and sell in a couple of years.  you're only getting offers of ninety thousand dollars.  So already you've lost $10,000.  So again, I know that's a simplistic explanation, but that is not uncommon, especially with how markets are changing today, especially in several cities.  I'm thinking in Australia, in Western Canada, and even parts in the U.S.  where prices in real estate now are starting to fall.  just like we saw in 2008, 9, 10, 11, and 12.  Again, you not only need to think about what did you pay, but again, when you're selling, you're going to inevitably incur commissions to sell, fees to sell, expenses.  some sort of taxes to sell, etc.  Unless you are holding your real estate that you've purchased ideally at least five to seven years.  I said five to seven years.  And are you sure you really want to do something for five to seven years?  Unless you're sure you really want to do that, you need to think very carefully about before you buy any real estate.  Let me summarize this point.  When you buy a home, specifically you are choosing one particular city, one particular neighborhood, one particular street, one particular house.  Summing up, go very slowly, especially being a young man, especially in what would be a millennial, let's just say between 18 and 34, go slowly.  Three, continuing on with buying a house, nearly always, never, Nearly always.  It requires, and more than one commenter has mentioned this, it requires a significant amount of debt.  Now, I'm not going to get on the Dave Ramsey bandwagon that all debt is evil and terrible, etc.  I've spoken enough in the past about debt before.  I do think having debt, especially a large amount of debt relative to your income, requires a high level of what I call financial intelligence.  And most men, frankly, especially young men, don't have it.  I know I certainly didn't have it at 25 or 30 years.  And so therefore, my point is, I would highly encourage you to avoid all forms of debt.  Because when you take on debt, and again, it's almost for sure when you buy a home, you are going to ultimately have to take on debt.  You are putting yourself, my friend, in a box.  You are choosing to obligate yourself and become a slave, if you will.  And yes, I'm using that term literally.  a slave to the lender.  You will always be paying him his money.  He does not want to hear your excuses.  He doesn't want to hear your sob stories.  He doesn't want to hear how you're out of work, you got your hours cut, whatever it might be.  He doesn't want to hear how bad the economy is.  He wants his money every single month.  And not only does he want it every single month, he's plural he's probably going to want it as many times people do.  they will take out a 30 year mortgage.  so at age 25 you start paying.  you're not paid off on that mortgage.  you just make the monthly payments till you're 55 years old.  finishing this particular point yes some debt can be extremely valuable.  i know at least one commenter here who has done tremendously well using leveraged debt, using real estate debt to make a lot of money.  And so it can be done.  And Robert Kiyosaki, I've referenced him numerous times, highly advocates this.  However, specifically, I'm talking about the typical man who's purchasing a single-family residence, who's taking out that 30-year mortgage.  Again, extremely common.  I'm telling you, young man, be very, very very careful.  it's probably not a good idea.  i personally i didn't purchase any real estate till i was in my 40s although i gotta also say for the 20 years prior to that.  numerous times many many times i was extremely tempted But fortunately, I wised up or circumstances changed,  etc.,  and I didn't do it.  Here's the bottom line.  Don't take on debt because ultimately for a lot of people, for most people, for four out of five people, it'll ultimately be a ball and chain around your leg.  Let me finish this topic by saying this.  Men, don't throw away one of your most valuable assets so easily and quickly in life.  Again, one of your biggest assets, as so many men keep referencing, I'm a MGTOW and I've got freedom.  Let me just tell you, you're not going to have freedom if you've got a tremendous amount of debt.  I don't care if you're a MGTOW or not.  If you've got a tremendous amount of debt, you are not free, my friend.  I'm talking to men who are MGTOWs, who want true financial freedom to move forward with their lives, to do what they want, with whom they want, when they want.  Gentlemen, as always, hit the like button if you found this profitable.  John Galt, out. ",
