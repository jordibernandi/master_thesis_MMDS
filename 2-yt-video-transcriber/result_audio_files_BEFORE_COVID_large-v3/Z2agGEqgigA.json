We'd be at the mercy of very real, tangible consequences that don't rely upon the easily manipulated claims of what an unseen deity says or thinks.  Nor can we rely on the existence of an afterlife to provide us with justice.  So we must therefore strive to create a just world in the here and now.  Since that is what we try to do, maybe deep down we don't really believe.  Maybe that's why we don't just abandon justice to a God in an afterlife, but desperately try to seek justice in this life before death.  Maybe that's why we painfully grieve rather than rejoice when a loved one supposedly goes to heaven.  Maybe that's why we think more about things like traffic and sports than the Bible.  Why we know more about our favorite show than what the literal creator of the universe supposedly wants us to know.  Maybe that's why we don't really fear God enough to stop us from doing bad things.  Maybe our actions speak louder than our words, and we behave like God doesn't exist, because deep down, we don't really believe he does. ",
