            "text": "The message today is about God's order versus the new world order.  Now there are three and only three covenant institutions that God put on the earth.  What are they?  Thank you, marriage.  All right, so let's just say family.  Out of that marriage comes a whole family.  Family is a covenant relationship.  What else?  Thank you, the church.  The church is a covenant institution.  Can you say that?  That's a mouthful.  The church is a covenant institution.  Nice.  I like that.  So I put a church there.  This is a pretty modern looking church.  What's the last one?  Government, wow, these are experts.  I think there are no newbies here.  These are all the experts in this church right here.  Now, what are the differences between these three?  It's very important to know the differences and the mandate that God has given to each of them.  Let's start on the negative side.  The state cannot make money.  Did you know that?  We're used to the state printing money, but they're not allowed just to print money out of nowhere.  There has to be productivity.  It has to match the productivity.  The state doesn't produce any wealth.  Isn't that interesting?  Who produces the wealth?  You, the family.  And you do it to feed the family.  As soon as you get a kid, I bet you your productivity goes up.  There's no other way.  You do or you die.  Is that right?  The family creates wealth.  How important is the family?  It's the engine of prosperity in our lives.  The family.  They've done many studies where singles are not as prosperous, so they say singles are poorer than married people.  In every way, not just financially, but in every way, mentally, emotionally, in all sorts of ways.  There's something about the mandate of God upon families.  And that's why Satan attacks it.  All right, the state cannot produce morals.  Have you noticed that?  The state is not even interested.  You would think the politicians are not even interested in morals.  Isn't that right?  And they make laws that are sometimes contradictory, self-contradictory laws.  You can't do that and be moral.  And the courts sometimes make judgments that we would find, by biblical standards, completely immoral.  And that's been the history of the state's judicial system for hundreds and hundreds of years.  killed so many people by the court and imprisoned people like Nelson Mandela.  All that's by the court.  That wasn't just done illegitimately.  It was done by state power.  So the state cannot make morals.  Well, who does?  Only the church.  Think about that.  The only institution in the world right now that is interested, interested in good and evil, right and wrong, morals, You're sitting in it.  No one else cares, unless it affects them.  Of course then they care.  But otherwise, who's spending the time to explain good character, good behavior to our children?  It's the church, right?  The state cannot just make up morals.  When they do, they're self-contradictory.  The church has a mandate from God.  So we can put it this way.  Economic sovereignty belongs to the family.  Now, it's a very long way to say it, but it's quite powerful.  Economic sovereignty belongs to the family.  You have a right to keep what you earn.  It should be a right, shouldn't it?  It's economic sovereignty.  And then we can say this, judicial sovereignty belongs to the church.  Again, it's a very maybe flowery way to say it, but it's a powerful way to say it. ",
