Now I, I find this to be a stretch, uh, Yeah, again, this is all rumor, guys.  How could they slip this under the radar?  Yeah.  But there's also not a lot of talk about what we're going to see in Series 12, and we're only a couple months away from it dropping.  Whereas with other seasons of Doctor Who, people pretty much knew what was going to happen.  Months beforehand, there were lots of spoilers, lots of leaks.  And it could just come down to the fact that nobody really cares.  Yeah, that could be.  But anyway, the rumor is that they actually filmed scenes with Rose Tyler.  Billy Piper as Rose Tyler and the 13th Doctor.  possibly in a romantic fashion.  And it did not play well to the BBC, which led to a split between Chibnall and Whitaker, and that they're leaving after Series 12.  But we're going to talk about why that probably... was inevitable.  anyway, regardless of whether or not these rumors are true.  And these are two very different rumors, but they all end the same.  Chibnall's out the door, Whitaker's out the door, yada yada.  So this is coming from Bounding in the Comics, who has this guy's Twitter pulled up.  Again, this is coming from Twitter, which is a bastion of journalistic integrity.  Mm-hmm.  So take it for what it is.  The rumor comes from a Twitter user who reports an anonymous, I always love this, anonymous whistleblower told them that one of the key reasons Chibnall is leaving is a dispute over to bring back Rose Tyler.

So, again, this is a different rumor.  The other rumor about Chibnall leaving was that the BBC grilled him about merchandising.  Mm-hmm.  that this new series was not something you can merchandise.  And we, we joked before about like, what are they going to do?  Have like a, a Graham coffee shop scene where Graham and Ryan can sit down and have coffee together. ",
