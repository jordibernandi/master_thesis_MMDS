I think all of us who've enjoyed Francis Chan's teachings in the past were shocked to see him go this way.  But the stuff Todd is saying is really sad.  Now the original video is 30 minutes, but I'm gonna cut the last part because it's just him giving so much praise to how great of a man Kenneth Copeland is, and I don't think anybody wants to hear that.  Yet, I'll leave the full length at the end of this video.  I'll be making my own commentary throughout this video though, so let's do this. ",

In the Old Covenant, murdering somebody is killing somebody.  In the New Covenant, hating somebody is the same as murdering somebody.  In the New Covenant, adultery isn't just cheating on your wife, it's looking lustfully.  God wants to change your heart.  And if he changes your heart, he changes your mind.  And if he changes your mind, you can actually think with the mind that you've been given, which is the mind of Christ.  But deep cries out to deep.  Deep cries out to deep so we can look past the way that someone's acting.  We can look into the heart of the Father and say, what good things do you have planned for the one that hates me?  Lord, they hate my guts, and I really know that they don't hate me.
