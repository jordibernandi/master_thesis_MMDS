Now, you over the weekend reiterated with adverts in many national newspapers what you've been saying for a few days now is that you are offering an electoral pact to Boris Johnson's Conservative Party.  You'll stand down candidates in their seats where they're most likely to win.  They should stand down candidates in the seats where you're more likely to win.  And together, you reckon you could deliver a 100-strong majority vote for the Conservative Party and for Leave to deliver Brexit.  Have you had any response from the Conservative Party yet, Nigel? ",

You know, if I was to say to Brexit Party voters and supporters and to really endorse candidates other than ours in the right constituencies, I think we could deliver a 60 to 100 majority.  Yeah, I genuinely do.  Look, out there in the country, Most people just want this over.  They want us to get on with the rest of our lives.  And so I've said, look, much as I'm immensely proud of what we've built in the Brexit party in the last 22 weeks, country before party at a moment like this so we can get some resolution on Brexit.  And it's up to Boris Johnson.  But there's one condition.  There's one condition, and the condition is we do not want any reheated form of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement.  It's the worst deal in history.  We want a clean break and to become an independent country.  And if Boris goes down that route, then I think it makes sense for us to work together. ",

We're going to get royal assent for the bill, which is known by the Tories as the Surrender Bill, to actually stop us from leaving with a no-deal Brexit on October 31st, as the ticket on which Boris Johnson got himself elected as Tory leader and has promised the country he will do.  We're also expecting to have this vote to have another attempt at having a general election.  Boris Johnson is expected to lose that election.  Why do you think that the opposition parties want to avoid a general election right now?  Because, of course, Labour and the Lib Dems are saying, everyone's always talking about people's votes, are they not?  And they're always talking about how the country is opposed to no deal, is opposed to what the Tories are trying to do.  Why then do you think they're trying to stop that from happening? ",

What do you think the most likely outcome is in the coming weeks?  Because if Boris Johnson says, I'm not going to ask for this extension...

Now, the Prime Minister's chief advisor, he was in charge of the Vote Leave campaign.  You were in the rival Leave.eu campaign.  We know some of us just from that documentary starring, docudrama starring Benedict Cumberbatch, that there is no love lost between you and Dominic Cummings.

Cummings has always been against.  what he would have seen as hardline leavers, and yet he now appears to be the man behind Boris Johnson, you know, pushing a message that we'll leave with no deal if we can't improve the current one.  So maybe Dominic Cummings' politics has changed over the course of the last three or four years.  I don't know.  But ultimately, you know, if you add up in the opinion polls where the Tories are, where the Brexit Party are, and put them together, all right, not every one of those voters will come across.  But even if you take a bit off the top of both, Together, in a pact, in a general election, we would be unstoppable.  And ultimately, whatever Dominic Cummings' personal traits may be, he's no fool.

And the Brexit party was started, you won the European elections in May because you were offering a proper Brexit, a no-deal, a clean Brexit.  Probably happy to have a deal, a free trade agreement or something, but something, a proper Brexit that people who voted in 2016 would recognise as being what they voted for.  Now you've got a Prime Minister, now you've got a leader of the Conservative Party, you know that two-thirds of the Tory party members and two-thirds of Tory MPs voted for a man who said he will deliver, deal or no deal, do or die, a proper Brexit.  Some would say, isn't it time for you to stand aside completely?  Forget an electoral pact.  Time for you and the Brexit party to stand aside, give the Tory party a free reign.  We know that that leave vote is split between the two parties.  If you walked away, those people would have no choice but to vote for the Tory party who can deliver Brexit.

And look what happened.  You're asking me to trust Boris Johnson, who's pretty much saying the same things that she said.  Remember this.  Twice, Boris voted against the withdrawal agreement, saying it would reduce us to a vassal state, effectively becoming a colony of the European Union.  Then at the third time of asking, what did Boris do?  He voted for it.  If the Brexit party wasn't here, I think Boris would be very tempted to sell us out on a reheated version of Mrs May's treaty.
