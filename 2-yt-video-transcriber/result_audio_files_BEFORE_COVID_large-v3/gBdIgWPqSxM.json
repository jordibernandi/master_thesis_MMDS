There's only a minimal amount being released and it's a harmless solid material such as dust.  These aerosols give a form of grip for the water molecules to grasp onto and condense into clouds.  Yes, that's right.  Contrails are essentially just clouds.  And because of the stability of the water molecules and the aerosol grip, contrails can be visible in the sky for a long time.

Aerosol injections is part of a type of a large group of sunlight manipulation called solar radiation management, or SRMs.  What are SRMs?  Well, as you know, the planet is warming, human activities are warming the climate, which will lead to detrimental effects, especially in the future.  A solution that has been explored extensively are SRMs, which includes a variety of methods to reflect sunlight back into space.  Reducing the incoming sunlight will reduce temperatures, which could work to slow down the effects of global warming.  One proposed method of SRMs are atmospheric injections of aerosols.  Now let me explain briefly how it works.  Clouds in the sky have a high albedo property, meaning they reflect sunlight.  So in this sense, we can increase the quantity of clouds in the atmosphere to do just that.  An easy way to stimulate the formation of clouds is to introduce aerosols in the air.  Like I mentioned previously, water vapor can grip around the aerosols and condense it to clouds.  So by injecting more aerosols into the sky, more clouds can form.  I believe the most popular proposed aerosol to use right now is salt.  We can just take salt water from the oceans and put them to good use.  Doesn't sound too bad, right?  This is a topic that is quite irrelevant to chemtrails, but since you don't understand the science of it or why it is being done, I can understand how you could confuse SRMs with the spraying of non-existent chemicals.

Yes, metal oxide, such as aluminum oxide, was indeed proposed to be injected into the atmosphere.  It's done for a purpose of reducing the effects of global warming.  Usual greenhouse gases are generally great at absorbing longer wavelength infrared radiation from the earth.  The aerosols being injected here, such as aluminum oxide, have the ability to convert the shorter wavelength infrareds into longer ones, which can then be radiated easily into space.  This method of heat management is different than what I was talking about earlier since it doesn't necessarily increase albedo for sunlight reflection, but rather makes it easier for the Earth to radiate heat back into space.  These ideas were proposed to combat global warming, but let's say you are concerned about the health effects.  Well, first of all, aluminum oxide isn't very toxic.  On the hazard diamond, it scores a 1 on the blue diamond out of 4, meaning it is slightly hazardous.  Long-term exposure could lead to some health effects, such as pulmonary fibrosis, but you're not going to receive nearly enough to get there.  The people who could potentially suffer from this would be aluminum oxide refinery workers, for example.  And then the other parts of the diamond are all zero, meaning it's not flammable nor is it reactive.  So harmless as it's used in sunscreen all the time.  So then I ask you, if chemtrails truly were real, why would they even be spraying aluminum oxide?  It's not going to do anything.  What would even be the purpose?  It'd be so pointless. ",
