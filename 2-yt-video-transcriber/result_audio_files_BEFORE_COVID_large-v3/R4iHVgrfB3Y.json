            "text": "Welcome to the FiveThirtyEight Political Forecast, where we take the temperature of Washington and you, the American people.  Since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would be opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a lot has happened.  The nation's top intelligence official facing tough questions from lawmakers on that whistleblower complaint.  You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart, right?  With spies and treason, right?  We used to handle it a little differently than we do now. ",

            "text": "So what do you, the people of this great nation, think about impeachment?  Well, here's what the polls say, and we're using an average of all the polls so far.  As of September 23rd, the day before Pelosi's announcement, 51.1% of Americans were against the idea of impeaching the president, while 40% were for it.  But what a difference a week can make.  As of October 2nd, 45.1% of people are against impeachment and 46.7% are in support.  That's some real movement in a little over a week.  As you might expect, Democrats are largely in support of impeachment, while few Republicans are.  And what about Congress?  According to the New York Times, 226 members of Congress are on board with an impeachment inquiry as of October 3rd.  All Democrats and one Independent.  Of course, it's early days yet.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just acknowledged that he listened in on the call with the Ukrainian president, despite denying knowledge of the contents of the whistleblower complaint just last week.  Also, the House plans to subpoena the White House's records on the Ukraine scandal.  So we may soon have more information on the timeline of Trump's pressure on Ukraine and whether the White House tried to bury the investigation.  There is going to be a lot to unpack.  And the Democrats still have a lot of minds to change.  So be sure to check in next week for another FiveThirtyEight forecast.
