            "text": "Yes, and I'd like you to name... And the reason I would like you to name all the tribes is because there were many tribes who conquered many other tribes.  So just as an example... Thank you.  Just as an example, the Comanche Indians come in and they conquer areas run by the Apache Indians.  Now the United States comes in and it owns that land.  To which tribe should that revert?  To which tribe should that land revert?  The Comanche who had it before us or the Apache who had it before them?  Moreover, for the people who still exist, you're referring to Christopher Columbus in an ahistorical way by calling him some sort of racist or some sort of genocidal maniac.  The man never committed any sorts of genocide at all and he was actually known among the Spanish explorers for his good treatment of the natives.  That point is neither here nor there.  And I encourage people to read biographies of Christopher Columbus because there's a lot of historical fiction out there.  The point on that is that when the Spanish came to this country, and to this continent, they did create a new race known as Latinos.  This is a mixture of Spaniards and Native American populations.  So if we're going to revert certain land to native populations, why would we not then immediately take that land away from them because they also descend from Spanish explorers.  In what sort of atomized way would you define your own race, your own identity?  I think this is a very backwards and ultimately impossible view of personal identity that puts your stock in some particular ancestor rather than something that is larger than yourself.  I think it's a madness of the modern left and it leads to to crazy policy proposals such as saying that somebody who descends from a native population in Colombia has a right to move to any apartment he wants to in New York because of race or something.
