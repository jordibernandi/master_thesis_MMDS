Oh, you really don't want to know.  So join me now as we go in search of sanity at the Democratic Socialists of America's convention held in Atlanta over this last weekend.  Gentlemen, if I hadn't just totally blown this already, our DSA friends got together in Atlanta.  Now, the last I'd heard, all the good left-wingers were boycotting Georgia because of some abortion law or some gun law or something or other.  But in any case, the socialists decided to meet in Atlanta anyway because they probably got a great rate on rooms during the August heat when nobody else wants to be in Atlanta.  And if one thing socialists are really good at, of course, it's saving money.  So with that in mind, I want you to see a clip.  This is, I believe, from the opening rules establishing meeting at the DSA conference.  And, well, somebody's got to get their little bit in.  Watch the clip and see. ",

See, here's the thing that I don't think the schedule, maybe we should just write him an email.  The problem with revolutions is they're kind of loud.  They make quite a bit of noise, what with the gunfire and the tanks in the streets and things blowing up and stuff.  And if you're going to bring a communist or a socialist revolution to this country, I just don't think he fully appreciates just how noisy that'll be and how distracting.

And then eventually the company grows and becomes encrusted with bureaucracy.  And then you can't get anything done without having 17 meetings.  Well, right now, these young socialists are going through this period of time where everything feels exciting and cool and everybody gets to speak and you can stand up in a meeting and tell people you don't want them to clap their hands or make loud noises because it's triggering you and you can do all of this kind of stuff that makes you feel like you're really making a difference.  When the commissar takes over and everybody is told, not just, hey, I've got an idea of what our rules should be, but this is what our rules should be.  There will be no variance.  You're not going out any other door other than the door I told you to go out.  You're not going to speak unless spoken to.  When that happens, then all of a sudden you go, well, wait a minute.  This wasn't the dream I signed on for.  And it never is.  It never is the dream you signed on for because in the seed of it produces the fruit of socialism, communism, despotism, and slaughter.  It's that's in the seed and you just don't know it.  when you're still at the seed stage and you think that you're going to reach utopia, but you don't realize that that book Utopia was really a satire.  You don't understand that.  it's something that is a violation of human nature and you need to be able to recognize the seeds of that.  at the beginning.  Right now I'm reading a book called Freedom is an Endless Meeting.  And it's a study of democratic movements throughout the history of the United States and how they were structured and how they operated.  And it's from a left-wing perspective.  And one of the things they're talking about is the difficulty.  I think the term they use is they wanted their organizations to be prefigurative.  Essentially, they wanted the organization not only to have a set of ideals, but to the way they operated would actually prefigure the ideals themselves so that when their dream came to fruition, when what they wished for happened, they were already living that way.  It's kind of if you're in a civil rights movement, you should be treating people with dignity and respect no matter their race and all that kind of stuff.  And in every one of them, I haven't, no spoilers, I haven't gotten to the end of this book yet, but I suspect in every one of them, they're going to find that that, you know, that sort of persistent human nature stands in the way of making this happen.  On the one hand, these people are funny and you see this Democratic Socialist of America meeting and you can't help but laugh.  On the other hand, there's not a lot of difference between what I saw in these clips from that meeting and what used to be a diagnosable mental condition. ",
