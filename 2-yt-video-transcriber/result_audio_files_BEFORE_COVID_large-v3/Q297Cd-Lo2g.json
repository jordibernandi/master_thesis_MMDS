            "text": "Rape.  Two rape cases in the 1980s.  What was Inez Garcia supposed to do for the man who declared war on her body?  The man who carved a combat zone between her breasts.  Was she supposed to lick crabs from his hairy ass, kiss every pimple on his butt, blow hot breath on his big toe, draw back the corners of her vagina and hee-haw like a California burro?  This being wartime for Inez, she stood facing the knife, the insults, and her own smell drying on the penis of the man who raped her.  She stood with a rifle in her hand, doing what a defense department will do in times of war.  And when the man started grunting and panting and wobbling forward like a giant hawk, She pumped lead into his 300 pounds of shaking flesh, sent it flying to the Virgin of Guadalupe, then celebrated Day of the Dead Rapist Punk.  And just what the fuck else was she supposed to do?  And what was Joanne Little supposed to do for the man who declared war on her life?  Was she supposed to tongue his encrusted toilet stool lips?  suck the numbers off of his tin badge, choke on his claptrap balls, squeeze on his nub of rotten maggots, and sing, God bless America, thank you for fucking my life away?  This being wartime for Joanne, she did what a defense department will do in times of war.  And when the piss-drinking, shit-sniffing guard said, I'm going to make you wish you were dead, black bitch, come here, Joanne came down with an ice pick in the SWAT freak motherfucker's chest.  Yes, in the fat neck of that racist policeman, Joanne did the dance of the ice picks.  And once again, from coast to coast, house to house, we celebrated Day of the Dead Rapist Punk.  and just what the fuck else were we supposed to do? ",
