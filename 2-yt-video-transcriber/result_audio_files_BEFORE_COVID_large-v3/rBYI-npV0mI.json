They just got me hopped up on me and they're giving me every drug in the world.  Man.  But yeah, I'm still in the hospital, so I'm supposed to be out today.  dude man you can't get no rest in the hospital.  they check on you every five fucking minutes.  i try to take a nap and then they come in and take the blood pressure and yeah they don't.  you can't really get no rest in the hospital.  man you know.  yeah man so i'm chilling.  You know what's funny about the hospital?  They wanted something real weird.  Last night, the nurse was like, we want to take a picture of your backside.  What the fuck?  She said, yeah, we want to, for the other nurses or something.  Have you ever heard of that?  They were like, yeah, we want to take a picture of your backside.  I said, what?  Yeah.  So the other nurses, have you ever heard of that?  What's up, a lot of body?  Yeah, man.  She's like, yeah, you can choose.  You can choose not to have a picture taken.  I'm like, hell no, I don't want no picture taken.  I'm like, who the fuck is the doctor?  Malik Yoba?  Get the fuck out of here.  foot problem.  I didn't have bussy surgery.  What the **** y'all talking about?  Like you wanna take a picture of your yeah, your backside.  I don't know what that **** was about.  I've never heard of that before.  That's just for the other nurses I guess so they can recognize you from the back.  I don't know what that **** sounds.  I've never heard of that before.  I'm like, no, ma'am, I pass on that.  Y'all scam my fucking wristband if y'all want to find out who I am.  They're not getting no pussy prints from me.  Shit.  I guess if they come in the room and see somebody laying from the side, I don't know what the fuck.  But I'm cool.  You work nights.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  I'm like, are y'all trying to recognize somebody from the back?  What the fuck is that?  What is that?  I've never heard of that before.  I'm asking those.  I'm like, well, really?  Anybody in the medical field ever heard of that?  Where they want to take a picture of your ass?  Like, I'm not a thot trying to get a fat transfer.  What are y'all trying to get a shot of my ass for?  Yeah, that's real weird.  So, is it, say, it's for insurance?  Mike Lowry, what kind of insurance is that?  I don't know.  I ain't got that kind of coverage.  Shit.  Yeah, that ain't on my policy.  Shit.  I've never heard of that before.  No, I'm good.  What's up?  Is that my dude Taz?  Everybody say what's up to Taz daddy, the business bully.  Have y'all ever heard of that though?  I've never heard of that.  What's up?  It's a treasure.  I'm gonna ask another nurse about that when they get in.  Yeah, I'm good, man.  They told me I can't, I'm not supposed to walk on my foot.  They had to do, I had surgery done on my foot a few weeks ago.  Then the bad infection had swole up and then they had to go back in and get a whole bunch of tissue out.  So my foot is hemmed up.  That's my foot right there.  There's a big boot they're going to put on my foot.  So, your nigga, my foot is looking real decrepit right now.  Nigga, my foot look like Danny Glover in the color purple.  My foot looks old and decrepit.  Yeah, they had to get that foot together.  Yeah, so I gotta sit down.  That's the problem.  They said, look, nigga, sit your **** down.  I try to do too damn much.  I be up and running around.  They're like, no, no, no.  You got to sit your ass down for a few weeks.  Yeah.  So that's what it is.  Hell yeah, they have my ass in the National Enquirer.  Yeah.  can walk.  I can walk.  I'm not supposed to walk though.  They got.  um where's you see the crutches over there?  They got they.  they said I supposed to wear crutches.  I supposed to do that.  So that's what it is.  Yeah.  So your twelve year old just listened to the the last podcast.  That's what's up.  So I just had some coins removed.  What's up, Miss Texas?  How are you, dear?  But I'm good, man.  A lot of folks have been asking how I'm doing.  I'm good.  I'm actually good.  I just have not gotten any rest.  Like, I'm ready to go to the crib.  This hospital food is not the business.  Well, the breakfast was all right, but this shit is not the business.  I'm hungry, then I'm out like this.  I keep having to piss with this damn IV.  I've got to piss every five minutes because of this goddamn IV.  Yeah.  So.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Yeah, they got that bunion together.  All that gout tissue out of it.  What's up, Linus?  What's up, Miss Jade?  How are you?  Oh, I don't eat beef.  Oh, I don't eat beef anyway, Jade.  As a matter of fact, they just brought me beef.  That's why there's nothing on my tray right now except for Bundt cake and some bullshit-ass soup.  So they were supposed to bring me some grilled chicken.  Pina's on her way up here.  They're about to just discharge me in a minute, so she's gone.  She's about to be up here.  My mom has to go watch our badass kids.  They're tearing up the house right now.  doing all types of shit.  Yeah, man, this food is not the business.  Yeah, yeah, you get no rest, man.  I'm trying to get a nice snooze and then they wake me up and take my blood pressure and I'm like, shit, then I gotta keep getting up to pee.  Yeah.  So I got to be off my feet for a minute.  Eat a butter biscuit.  Shit.  I wish they had one of this.  I would eat it.  I would eat it.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing, buddy?  Dirty linen.  Okay.  I don't think I have any.  There you go.  Let me get Miss Texas.  Miss Texas wants to get on live.  Let's get on here.  She's talking about.  Oh, she declined.  Okay.  Miss Texas, I thought you wanted to get in live.  What's up, Wasp Red?  I just had foot surgery.  Yeah, I had foot surgery.  I had a turkey sandwich yesterday here.  That was pretty cool.  I don't I don't know if they got another one.  Thank you.  No, no, no.  They offered to give me a flu vaccine shot.  I said, hell no.  They offered to.  Have you had the flu shot?  No.  Do you want one?  No.  I'm not here for no extra shit.  I'm cool.  Hell no.  Let's just stick to the basics.  Yeah.  Yeah, they've been putting all types of stuff in that IV, dude.  Yeah, they've been putting all types of shit in this IV.  They've been coming in and out, getting stuff in there.  Yeah, I'm cool on that.  We want you always to be showing the chest, nigga.  I'm not trying to be sexy right now.  Not the furthest thing I'm trying to do is be goddamn sexy in a fucking hospital gown and a Frankenstein foot.  Nigga's not trying to catch, trust me.  This shit is not the business.  I can't sleep hungrier than a motherfucker.  eating a dry-ass Bundt cake and some bullshit tea.  They gave me some tea with one pack of goddamn sugar.  Yeah.  So, I am ready to get the hell up out of here, dude.  So, I look appetizing in that gown.  Shit.  To who, though?  That's the problem.  Because they got asses out right now.  So I don't want to look appetizing right now.  They made me take off everything.  I tried to sneak my drawers on.  The male nurse came in and said, uh-uh.  I said, uh-uh what?  Those got to go.  I said, what?  Underwear too.  I said, oh, Lord.  They had to send your ass in this moment.  I'm like, nigga, where's the woman nurse?  Shit.  If I got to do all that, why they send you in here?  On draws duty, nigga.  Send the women in this mother, I guess.  All right, damn.  Yeah, I tried to, you know, I put the gown on, had my drawing.  Uh-uh.  Hold on, nigga.  It sounded like an assault.  Come on, player.  Why don't you turn around and go out the room so I can change my name?  Shit.  Those got to go.  I said, you're being real aggressive and I'm vulnerable, player.  Hold on.
