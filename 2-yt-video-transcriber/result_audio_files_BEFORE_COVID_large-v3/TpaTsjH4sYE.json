            "text": "All right, guys, he's going to get another one.  As soon as they turn this corner, he'll turn his lights on and grab another one.  be sitting over there behind the vehicle now.  Here he comes, guys.  Soon as he turns the corner there, he'll turn his lights on.  Right there.  As soon as he turned the corner, he turned his lights on and pulled her over.  Got unit 4039.  And these tickets are a couple hundred bucks a piece.  That's all this prick does all day.  Usually they call for a backup.  Guys, now that I know where he sits, I'm gonna go down there and warn the people as they come down the road.  I don't mind if the cop sees you speeding to pull you over, but this son of a bitch sits there and waits for you to come down there.  And then he nails you on his radar.  I think he's waiting for his 906.  I think he did call for backup.  You got your 906 coming?  Yeah, I don't like you being like this close behind me.  It's going to be this way all day.  It's just that I'm paying attention to you.  It's a bird.  There's a problem.  You're putting my life in danger.  She is getting a warning for your camera.  It actually says warning, but you're wasting her time by staying over there.  So I'll wait for my 906 to come.  He called the 906, guys.  He's one of those pussies.  Is your 906 going to follow me all day?  Was your last ticket a warning?  Yeah.  No, was it?  Yeah.  The man said you gave him a ticket.  Well, see, I'll wait until he gets here, and then I'll leave.  You can go to the next stop, too.  I'm going to be all here all afternoon.  I'm going to be here all with you all afternoon.  I just appreciate it if you're a little further back, so that way I'm not directing my attention to you.  Because I don't know if there is a gun in the car or anything else, so you're just wasting my time.  Yep.  Oh, he's... He's down there looking for you.  You're wasting her time.  No, actually, you're wasting her time.  She's on her lunch break.  If she's getting a warning, then you shouldn't have even fucking pulled her over.  You're right.  You should have been behind me.  Thanks.  How we doing, sir?  How are you today?  You going to be here all day?  I'll be here as long as he's here on his backup.  Cool.  Here's another one.  Oh, this is Sergeant.  This is Sergeant.  This is the Sergeant.  Are you there?  Yeah, so for your recording, she did get a warning, okay?  I don't follow instructions.  Like I said, I don't follow instructions.  There's no sense in you talking to me.  There's no sense in you talking to me.  As long as you're pulling people over, I'm going to record you.  I'll see you on the next one, sir.  Yep, well, I'll be there.  Have a good one.  I'll be there for sure.  Guys, we got unit 5214.  He'll pull around and then go over there and sit and wait.  He said he's going to be here all day.  So will I. i love it.  i freaking love it.  all right guys.  i'm gonna cut this one off and then wait for the next one.  next one i might go live spitting cobra cop.  watch i'm out. ",
