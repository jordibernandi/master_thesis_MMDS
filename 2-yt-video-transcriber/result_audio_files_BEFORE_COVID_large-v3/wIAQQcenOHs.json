            "text": "This particular person who said I have permission to share their story with you.  They are 41 years old and they started HRT a year and a half ago.  And this person says one of my friends has noticed that I'm changing in personality and she doesn't like this change.  I tried to explain to her how the first few years have a big impact on our personalities and that the baby trans phase, which resembles adolescenthood, is an important phase to go through in order to find balance later on.  And this person says they feel like they're on a roller coaster ride and they're trying their best to keep it together, but they feel pretty uninformed when it comes to this phase.  So I think it's really cool that this person even knows that this is something that exists.  I have this come up a lot of times in sessions with my clients.  so let's start with a discussion around eric erickson's stages of cycle social development.  that is what this person is referring to.  so i just googled this.  but just to let you know There's different stages of development according to Eric Erickson, and a lot of people give his studies a lot of validity.  And so there's different stages, like what happens between ages zero and one and a half, et cetera, et cetera.  So once you get to I think what is pretty important aspect of what this person's talking about is between ages 12 and 18, you have what is called identity versus role confusion.  And during this stage, when people are between ages of 12 and 18, You are an adolescent and then you're going into like young teenager and then you're a teenager.  There's a lot, lot, lot that has to do with identity and your role.  And it's already confusing for somebody who's not trans, who's not queer, LGBTQ.  So then add on to it that there is something different.  definitely going on that is increasing that amount of confusion in oneself.  So this is, has to do with those who have not transitioned before puberty.  You know, you already went through puberty and you're transitioning to or addressing your gender identity later in life.  It could be even when you're in your early 20s and you're like, ah, no wonder I was so confused during my teenage years.  So what happens is that once you're able to, well, let me tell you what this article says.  Failure to successfully complete a stage can result in a reduced ability to complete further stages and therefore a more unhealthy personality and sense of self.  These stages, however, can be resolved successfully at a later time.  And that means you can move into the different areas of life that have to do with love and care and wisdom.  But basically you have become stunted.  in that stage that stage of identity versus role confusion and so you have arrested development.  you need to be able to figure that out.  like this article says you can resolve it.  so what happens is whatever age you are let's say that you begin to transition.  And again, this can relate to a lot of people also who experience this regarding sexual orientation, romantic orientation, and etc.  But you start going through that and you might then notice that you are experiencing things that feel like you're acting like a teenager, you're acting really young, maybe you feel like you're being irresponsible or immature or uh this is you trying to repair the damage that happened to you between ages 12 and 18 when you weren't you didn't know what your identity was and you weren't able to like go through that process and the way other people are.  so yes you might then end up doing that when you're older.  imagine it's like you push pushed pause during that time of your life and it doesn't matter if you're 25 45 65 you push play and there's a part of you.  it's not going to be every aspect of you but there's a part of you that's going to go way back to starting maybe even age 12 and you're going to have to work through some stuff from that time.  it could look like maybe the way that you are dressing in terms of style.  it could be the way that you are behaving.  um It could be true.  personality changes that are happening.  It could affect your relationships.  It will affect the way you feel about yourself.  It could affect the way that you feel about your work and your career.  Definitely the different roles that you play in life.  Those are all going to be affected by this.  And so, yes, it can be a bit tumultuous for yourself.  It can be tumultuous for the people around you.  And that's when you might hear people say things like, oh, it seems like you're changing so much.  Really what's happening is that you are getting to the root of who, not only who you truly are when it comes to your gender identity, but you, you, everything about you.  There's stuff that's just been builded up, builded up, built up, and it's, Imagine it's like all crusty and gross and you need to be able to move that stuff.  that really isn't you out of the way.  There's stuff that you're going to still hold on to that's always been a part of you.  And then there's going to be the new stuff that comes up that has just been, you know, repressed and covered over and it's going to come out all along with the gender identity exploration.  And you're finally reconciling that.  So this is why it can feel like this.  An example recently I had with a client was when they said that they were... She was actually hanging out with new friends.  And this person is about 37 years old.  And she said, I don't know.  I was just so nervous.  I wasn't sure if they liked me or not.  And afterwards I was analyzing everything I said.  And I couldn't figure out if there was anything I did dumb.  And... they were like, God, why am I thinking these things?  And I'm like, you sound a lot like a teenage girl.  And they're like, oh, no, no, yes, that's exactly what's going on.  I mean, if you can normalize it and validate that this is okay, that this is what you're going through, this is what you're feeling and experiencing, it's not going to last forever, but you've got to give yourself time and patience to get through this part.  And therefore, if you can explain this to some of the people in your life who are impacted, then you can also make them aware.  Like in the end, it's a good thing.  And it doesn't necessarily even mean that's going to be great for everybody around you, but for you to be able to, like this article says, reconcile and resolve.  This stunted this underdeveloped stage of your life.  then that way you're gonna be able to become healthier and you're gonna be able to have a stronger sense of self and resolve any personality Difficulties that have gone on which is also by the way a good reason to probably seek out therapy.  one thing I do want to mention is in my book is You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.  There's a whole section that has to do with looking back in the past.  And I ask lots and lots of questions.  They're not easy questions.  They have to do with childhood, adolescence, and teenage years.  when it comes to how did you experience this, how did you experience that, so that you can actually really dig down and see probably what are the different areas of your life that you weren't able to fully be able to express and explore when you were younger.  Those, even though it's gonna be hard to go through those exercises, you can still use that information so that you know this is what I still need to work on present day to help myself heal those wounds.  I'll put the link in the notes for my book in case you are curious about that.  So, well, anyway, that was a good question.  I appreciate that.  And I'll be sure every now and then to sprinkle a few of those into my videos.  See you next time. ",
