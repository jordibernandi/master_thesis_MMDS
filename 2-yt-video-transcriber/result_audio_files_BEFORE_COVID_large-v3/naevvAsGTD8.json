This is the courtroom where they take your money every week, or probably twice a week in this town.  This is where you would speak, where your lawyer would speak for you.  There's the judge's chair.  I want to sit in it.  At least they show some kind of respect to somebody in here.  That's awesome.  But wait, there's more.  Yeah, I have a couple questions.  Are you recording?  Yes.  I can't hear you all the way over there.  What are you recording?  Just everything I can see here in the public lobbies and the building area.  What is it for?  Just something I like to do.  But I'm here to ask a question.  You don't really have our permission to record us.  We don't understand what you're recording.  Well, you work for the public sector, right?  Alright, so they're not going to answer my question, I guess.  Do you know like average how much money and revenue that this court clerk's office brings in each month from the residents of Berlin?  What did they say?  Who you were calling?  Can I get my question answered?  The average revenue that this office brings in?  I don't even know.  Oh, will there be a way I could public record request that here?  Stonewalled.  Stonewalled in Berlin.  And I'm not even surprised about it because they stonewalled us for a police report, for a police complaint form a couple months ago when I was here at Keys.  Alright, so she was nice, she was nice, she was nice, and those two are a little bit different.  Now I'm getting that police complaint... How you doing, ma'am?  Good, how are you?  Good.  I'm here to pick up a police complaint form, an internal affairs investigation complaint form.  Yeah, I would just like to take it to my lawyer and have him fill it out with me and fax it over.  You can fill it out right here.  I would rather not.  I have a place to be right now.  Okay, you can come back when it's convenient for you, but we don't hand them out, we fill them out.  Well, the Attorney General's website for New Jersey says that they should be publicly available out here.  I see everything else, but I don't see.  Please Complaint forms.  This place went goofy quick, man.  Hey, how you doing?  Here's our internal affairs packet.  Okay, great.  Thank you.  You can turn it in whenever you want.  Right.  And if you have any complaints, just drop it back over here.  If you want, you want to give your contact information so we can contact you back?  Well, you'll have it when I hand it in.  You'll have it when I hand it in.  Okay.  Thank you for clearing that up with her.  Take your time.  I got goofy.  Who are these guys?  How you doing?  Good.  Oh, yeah.  Fire marshal's office still open?  Yeah.  Can I help you?  Oh, great.  Are you the director?  I'm the fire marshal.  Oh, you are the fire marshal.  All right, yeah, great.
