First, though, let's look at this report from our Westminster correspondent, Lewis Goodall, who has also learned that the technology, which some Conservatives believe could allow Britain and Ireland to diverge without the need for hard border checks, is unlikely to be ready for at least a decade.

Sky News has obtained the contents and slides of a presentation compiled by the Home Office which looked into this exact question.  It outlines the government's best guess for how a technological solution to the border might work.  Suffice to say, it isn't simple.  The Home Office suggests using four different technologies.  First, companies would upload their goods data into a computer system using blockchain systems.  Second, sensors and the Internet of Things would detect the goods as they make their way along the route and send data back to the government so they know where and what it is.  Machine learning would tell authorities if a shipment looked risky and needed inspection.  And revenue collection on tariffs would be automatic.  So, nice and straightforward then.  But complexity is not the only issue.  For a start, as these documents make clear, there is no government anywhere in the world which manages to do this without putting infrastructure at the border.  It would require no fewer than 28 government agencies to be involved, each working with their own myriad different IT systems.  And there's no budget for this, no pilot work for it hasn't even begun.  It would require extensive cooperation, not only from the Republic of Ireland, but from the European Union as well.  And here is the absolute kicker.  These documents say that similar technological solutions won't be ready to be brought online in the United Kingdom until 2030.  This former border force officer thinks the chance of something like this working is minimal. ",
