            "text": "Mrs.  Margaret Slee, President of America's Planned Parenthood Federation, maintains that European women should stop having babies for the next 10 years.  Don't you think such a theory, such a radical theory, is antisocial?  On the contrary.  It seems to me that it is more practical and humane.  What about the women who want babies now and in 10 years will not be able to have babies?  Rather impractical, don't you think?  Oh, John, you do ask hard questions.  I should think that instead of being impractical, it is really very practical and intelligent and humane.  But, Mrs.  Slee, in this country, having babies is the only thing left which is both unrationed and untaxed.  Do you think we really ought to stop?  Well, I suppose a subject like that is really so personal that it's entirely up to the parents to decide.  But from my view, I believe that there should be no more babies. ",

            "text": "Hey folks!  I found a really interesting poll recently on European birth rates.  Now typically we're told that mass immigration is needed, simply in order to keep the population level static.  Because at present, most European countries are below the replacement birth rate.  So simply put, we are having too few children to reasonably sustain ourselves in the future.  Of course, one peculiarity to all this is that the population, so far as I can tell, was never asked how it could best be assisted in maintaining a steady reproductive rate.  It was independently decided by the United Nations that we would simply import people from the Third World to continue our lineage.  Because on average, non-white demographics tend to have a much higher birth rate.  What I wasn't expecting to come across in this poll was evidence from most countries in Europe, including and especially the United Kingdom, that although at present the native population is below the sustainable reproductive rate, it's not because women do not want to have children.  And that was actually something that was surprising to me.  Actually, the figures show the complete opposite.  So let me give you an example.  In 2002, at a central point of the Labour government's immigration explosion, a population study from the ONS showed that only 8% of British women did not want to have babies.  And only 4% wanted one baby.  Now that's staggering!  In fact, the most popular desire of British women, with an aim of a clear 55%, was to have at least two children.  A further 14% wanted three children, and another 14% wanted four.  In fact, 5% wanted five or more children.  Now, if you are seeking a either stable or slowly growing population, well, these numbers would more than cover for the 8% of women who did not want children.  In other words, whilst fertility does need a little bit of a push, a wee bit of encouragement and a helping hand, the desire to have children, and that's the most relevant thing here, the desire is there.  And it's there overwhelmingly so.  Now I know this doesn't seem like a stunning revelation, But actually I think it's very significant.  An assumption has been made that British couples simply aren't having as many children because they don't want them.  And this misrepresentative claim has been used to justify the reasoning behind mass third world importation.  But this ONS data turns that assumption on its head.  It is not for lack of desire, it's for lack of a believed incapability, and that is a very significant difference.  I don't know about you, but for a long time I was under the impression that this was some sort of existential crisis of the psyche.  Women were simply indifferent or apathetic, and that couples generally were less inclined toward a more familial lifestyle.  There is a marked difference between a population group that wants to reproduce in large enough numbers to sustain itself, but, for whatever reason, feels it cannot, and one that, as we've been persuaded to believe, is simply in the last dying gasps of its civilizational burnout.  I've struggled to really find any editorial on this data, which means that it's being suppressed, or at least not advertised, not circulated, almost as though it were deliberate.  I frequently hear the complaint that our women aren't having enough babies, as though they just weren't interested, but as we can see, there is a good deal more desire to procreate than formerly realised.  Although I consider the major demographic changes absolutely critical to the future of the West, I'm really against the eulogising of our people, all these references to the fall of Rome and Weimar degeneracy.  I do sympathise with them and I understand why they're relevant, but I also wonder if they're preparing us for a more easily accepted defeat.  And information like this study is really reassuring to me because here we have some very clear and very encouraging evidence that debunks the claim that our women have simply become detached, disinterested and unconcerned about their future.  So this information might feel quite small fry, and you might wonder why I've bothered to make a video on it, but actually, convincing a people of its own anatomical extinction, particularly when the evidence points to the contrary, is a very profound form of psychological warfare.  So much so that I was actually surprised to learn how desirable our women found the prospect of motherhood.  So the revelation might feel small, but actually, it shows that vital distinction between a civilization on its way out, and a civilization that just needs a little bit of temporary support.  So we need to make much, much more of this info.  If we can clearly demonstrate that children are indeed in the hearts and minds of our women, it is going to make the demographic replacement a much more thorny proposition.  It is much easier to replace a population that imagines it cannot reproduce, and has been persuaded of its own impotence.  Anyone who continues to argue for replacement migration in light of this knowledge really begins to look what we all really know they are.  Vengeful, genocidal fantasists that wish to see the death of the West.  It is one thing that birth rates are low, it is quite another thing that they are low because resources are being elsewhere more favourably distributed.  That is both a scandal and an outrage.  Whilst every effort is made to attend to the needs and concerns of third world mothers with 19 children, more than 80% of whom are on child welfare benefits.  It is difficult to find any formal assistance, charity or otherwise, for English women.  Since they would like to give birth, why don't they get first dibs on the benefits?  And that's a serious question.  What's happening here is not remotely normal.  Why, in a population struggling to sustain itself, are we seeing adverts in London for sterilisation?  These measures are actively deterring our population's capacity to flourish.  In fact, not only to flourish, but to continue full stop.  The immense pressure placed on housing and even just finding a school place for your child should start to be considered a human rights issue.  We really need to start being much kinder to ourselves and putting us first.  There's no reason that based on this evidence we cannot reassert our focus and look to distribute money spent on welfare benefits for ungrateful immigrants on our own future mothers.  The more we can debunk this need for replacement migration, the more difficult it will be to ignore our case for some sort of restorative policy.  Overwhelming our country with foreigners who are both hostile and consider themselves in direct competition with us is actively hampering our future.  almost every european will know at least some couples who are both in good jobs and who would never feel able to afford to have a third child.  actually only three types of people now have three children or more the very rich the poor and newly arrived immigrants.  So women, this is mostly a message for you.  We need to be making far more noise about the bounty of resources and goodie bags the state is practically forcing into the hands of third world mothers.  And it's not just the state.  There is a whole sinister web of bad faith actors out there, maneuvering under the title of charitable organization.  I find this deeply suspicious, so I'm going to really start interrogating this.  And I'm not making the case here for special female privileges.  I'm simply asking why the giant pot of money lavishly dished out on African and Middle Eastern mothers appears to be bypassing, if not outright triumphing, over our young ladies.  What's important here is that among immigrants, any provision for their children paid for by the European welfare state will be better than anything they could have expected in their country of origin.  Especially those who have come from third world countries.  Whereas native Europeans are concerned about competition for school places, housing shortages pushing average house prices up to between five and ten times average salary in their area, and how to afford one child, let alone three or four, But as the evidence shows, if they cannot afford the children, then they're onto a loser.  Simply put, we're being frozen out of our own continuation.  Mass importing a competing ethnic group with a much higher birth rate is more or less keeping our women treading water.  If European governments are really so worried about population decline that they would contemplate bringing in higher reproducing populations from other parts of the world, we have to ask, wouldn't it be more sensible for them first to work out whether there are policies that could encourage more bountiful procreation among their existing population?  You know, the people who actually built and own the country?  There are evidently resources there, we need to be making more of why they're not coming to us first.  In Poland, for instance, which has the same problem with low birth rates, the Justice and Law Party raise child benefit in order to try to raise the native birth rate and diminish any reliance on immigration.  In Hungary, Viktor Orban has announced new tax and loan benefits for families with at least two children to help them buy homes, and waiving personal income tax for women raising at least four children.  We do not need immigrants, he said, we need Hungarian children.  Women below 40 who marry for the first time will be eligible for a $36,000 subsidised loan, and a third of the debt will be forgiven when a second child is born.  In fact, the entire loan is waived after the third child.  And just like that, Hungary solved its birth rate problem.  What's interesting really here is that at the very least you'd expect our government to examine whether there are things that they are currently doing that are contributing to the worsening of the situation, including suffering the loss of one household salary for at least a period of time.  So having two children entails even more concern and even more worry.  A middle or average income couple in most European countries worries about having just one child and how they will afford that child.  It seems obvious to me that there are so many things a government can choose to do before deciding to import the next generation from another continent.  I mean, you couldn't choose a more divergent group with more contrasting values.  And I think we have a right to be hugely sceptical here about the motive.  I'm not trying to be conspiratorial, but given that there are such a high number of immigrants on welfare benefits, we know that it simply cannot be true that they came here to pay for our pensions.  we see very clearly that the next generation of migrants are not likely to contribute to the national economy as we were previously told.  Thankfully, what we see in this study is that there is more life in us yet.  Now, when they tell us we are not having enough babies, we can direct them to this study and ask why they are harvesting a future workforce for the next generation in the foothills of the African desert rather than the wombs of the women whose home this is.  Do not be under the impression that we have lost the interest, only the means.  And that's positive, that's deeply positive, because that need only be a temporary phenomenon.  I'm a bit worried that I haven't articulated my point very well here at the end of this video.  What I'm trying to stress is the relative ease with which Europe's birth rates could be put back on track.  We have been given the impression that this task is somehow insurmountable, that there exists a continent-wide existential burnout which carries all the signs of civilizational decline.  I don't know about you, but that feels a little bit suspect to me.  This is what I call death rattle propaganda, and as intoxicating as it is, its chief design is to leave us hopeless, disenchanted, and convinced of a rapidly approaching mortality.  And whilst these concerns are valid, never forget the distinction between a death that is natural, and a murder by way of policy.  What's happening to us isn't natural, it's the result of coercion and forced collectivisation.  And yes, we've been slow to realise it, but it isn't too late to resist.  It is the job of the radical immigrationists to try to seduce us into believing that this is all just part of the organic cycle of history, just part and parcel of living in a more globalised world.  Their job is to maximise the feeling of annihilation, so that we more readily live up to its status.  No, I am going to trace every decision made, every policy brought into fruition that has disenfranchised our people and made it difficult for them to reproduce.  Then we can begin to make a case for their reversal.  And who is going to stop us?  This is our home, we can do what we like here.  We will not permit our hostile elites to continue actively pursuing policies they know result in harmful consequences to life.  The erasure of white people is both foreseeable and avoidable.  These people are powerful, but they're not omnipotent.  Cheers, ladies.  You can hand your benefits over to us now.  You're not needed here anymore. ",
