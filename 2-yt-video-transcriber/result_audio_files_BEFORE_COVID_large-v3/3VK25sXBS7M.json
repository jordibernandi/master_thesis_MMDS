            "text": "Big opportunity coming out for 98% of all scientists and alarmists.  The New Zealand Climate Science Coalition is issuing a $10,000 prize for evidence that carbon dioxide causes dangerous global warming.  A prize of $10,000 named in honor of late Professor Augie Auer has been offered by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition to the first applicant.  to present real-world evidence showing the man-made fraction of airborne carbon dioxide causes dangerous global warming.  To help people understand that there is no convincing evidence by the acknowledged scientific method that man-made emissions of carbon dioxide can or do cause global warming to an extent that is dangerous or outside natural limits long observed and recorded, The coalition now challenges all alarmists and 98% of all scientists to produce such evidence, said the coalition's honorary secretary, Terry Dunleavy, MBE.  As the eminent Australian geologist, emeritus professor Ian Plimmer has written in the Australian newspaper just days ago, it has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.  All that we have so far from profits of climate doom here in New Zealand and worldwide are computer projections of models mostly constructed to achieve predetermined results.  We've had enough of ever increasing claims using hysterical terms like climate emergency that we decided to follow the example of the late Professor Michael Economides of Houston University, who in 2012 offered a prize of $10,000 for one professional paper that shows a causative causality between increased carbon dioxide and enhanced global temperature.  A prize, by the way, that was never claimed.  In particular, we are disturbed that so many of our children and young people are being misled by this unproven nonsense.  which is being propagated to create political and economic mischief.  Look at that.  Do you know how much that float costs?  Without scientific or real-world justification.  And is in breach of the Paris Climate Accord by aiming to force farmers in New Zealand to reduce food production, Mr.  Dunleavy said.  Now, if you want more details of the Augie Hour Climate Challenge Prize... I'll leave you links.  And in honor of the late Augie Auer, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Wyoming, I say awesome.  No one will ever claim this prize.  Pure propaganda.  Pure hockey shtick.  Share this with alarmists that need money.  It may even be funny.  And that's boom.  Be safe, everyone.  We love you. ",
