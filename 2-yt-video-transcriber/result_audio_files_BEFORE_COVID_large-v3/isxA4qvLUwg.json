            "text": "David, you talked about how a psychopath is not going to be susceptible to guilt feelings.  That said, how then would a psychopath respond to the gospel?  Because really becoming a Christian is recognizing our guilt.  So you, as somebody who got saved in prison, you haven't felt remorse or guilt, you would say, but at the same token, you recognize your guilt.  Can you help explain what that looks like a little bit? ",

            "text": "Yeah, a couple of things.  And I've actually heard from Christians over the years who've seen me give my testimony say, you're not really saved.  You're not really a Christian because you're sitting here giving this testimony and talking about all these horrible things you've done.  And you're not weeping over it.  You're showing no emotional reaction to anything you're talking about.  And it's important to keep in mind that that repentance means turning away, turning away.  And a psychopath isn't going to feel bad about things he's done.  He can turn away from things he's done.  So we are capable of saying, hey, I once thought that was a good thing to do.  And I recognize that.  whatever my feelings happen to be, I'm not supposed to do those kinds of things, right?  There is a God who has established a moral order, and even though I don't have certain feelings that other people have, I can recognize through what Jesus has taught that there is this moral order, there's a right and wrong, and however I happen to feel about it, I have an obligation to obey my creator and the one who has saved me, and so... So we're capable of that kind of moral reasoning.  The flip side is that sociopaths and psychopaths can often end up doing some really horrible things in life.  It's estimated that around 50% of serial killers are psychopaths.  So people can end up living normal lives, but they can end up doing some very horrible things.  And so in that sense, it can be a bit easier than for normal people to show them how horrible they are.  In other words, even though they don't have the feelings, if you've got a person who's lived a nice, good life, it can be very hard to convince that person, hey, you are in need of a savior.  If you can show a psychopath that there is some sort of moral order after he's done really horrible things in life, you can say, look, you are in need of a savior.  And yeah, I think I am. ",

            "text": "Yeah, I like to distinguish between the fact of guilt and guilt feelings.  There's the moral law, right and wrong, you break the moral law, you might not feel guilty, but you still are guilty.  Somebody commits a crime, they might not feel guilty, but they can still be accused of their guilt.  And what I feel like you have experienced in your life is a recognition of your guilt, absent of the feelings.  And I got to say, David, personally, as I've reflected on your story, I think that your faith in Christ could be a heck of a lot deeper than many professed Christians and Christians.  Because look, let's face it, if we didn't have the feeling of guilt to help sanctify us and tame us, how much would we want to get away with?  And here's a man who's pursuing the heart of God, faithfully and sharing the gospel.  And I just thank you for that because I think that the challenge that you would have to live faithfully, absent of that grace of feeling our wrongdoing, I would say that kudos to you, ma'am, for doing that and keep up your message.  We need to hear that. ",
