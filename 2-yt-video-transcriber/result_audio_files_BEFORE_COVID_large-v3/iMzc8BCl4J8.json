            "text": "One of the big controversies today has to do with vaccinations.  Should we vaccinate our children or should we avoid vaccinations altogether?  I'm joined today by Dr.  Francisco Delgado, who is a physician that specializes in the treatment of infectious diseases and who also is a Christian to help unpack these very important questions.  First of all, Paco, As a physician that treats infectious diseases, what is your view on vaccinations?  Are these safe?  Are these things that we should subject our children to, or should we avoid vaccinations altogether? ",

            "text": "Yes.  Probably it would be important to consider a world without vaccination.  So you just need to go back in time to see this couch, how horrible these infections affected the population.  What were the consequences of unvaccinated people and how many deaths we had from all that.  We have had the vaccines and really we have lost contact with that world, with that past.  So I do see the big benefit that vaccination does for people, but not only for the people that get vaccinated, but also for the people that are around.  How does this work?  If you get vaccinated, you will have some protection.  If you don't get vaccinated, that lack of protection may actually make you susceptible to an infectious agent.  And in turn, you can pass it on to someone else who is more vulnerable.  Let's say that there is someone who cannot receive a vaccine for X, Y, or Z reason.  If this person gets infected with that infectious agent, and he passes this on to this vulnerable person, this vulnerable person may die.  And that can be prevented just by doing the vaccination upfront. ",
