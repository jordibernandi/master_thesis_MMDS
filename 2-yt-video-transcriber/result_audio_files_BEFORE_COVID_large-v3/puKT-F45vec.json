            "text": "The day will come when a Virginian like myself needs a hand to pick him up.  And that hand will be held out by an Australian.  That hand will be held out by a Canadian.  That hand will be held out by a German.  The day will come when we will pick each other up.  When brothers white as snow all the way to our tannest coloration of skin of all configuration of hair and eye color come to the aid of each other, a pat on the back, a helping hand, even with different languages, we know on those battlefields, oratorical battlefields that they are, that we won't be ever alone.  that the moment we feel defeat creeping in upon us, the bugle will sound and comrades will show up from Italy, they'll show up from France, they'll show up from Norway.  This message to the anti-whites out there, if you think for a minute that we are going to allow one of ours to be struck down by you, to be attacked by you, and that we won't rally.  You better think again.  This is a new age.  This is a new age.  This is a new movement.  This is a new cause.  This is a new vein in the white positive sphere.  There is no giving up.  There is no compromise.  We lock shields with our spears forward, just like Leonidas and the Spartans.  Strike one and another one takes his place.  Our victory is fated.  It is written in the stars.  Know this.  Work every day of your life for white wellbeing knowing that our destiny has already been guaranteed to us.  Our recapturing of all that is ours is already in the cards.  It is fated that we recapture our destiny.  It is not a chance.  It is not a hope.  It is a guarantee.  Fight each day with the certainty that your efforts are worthwhile.  Look to each dawn with the knowledge that all that you do will accrue to our success and that nothing, not all of their money, not all of their efforts, not all of their hate can hold back tomorrow.  And that is why we will win. ",
