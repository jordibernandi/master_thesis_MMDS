            "text": "Hey guys.  In his writings and speeches, Cicero spoke of the dangers of populism and of the nature of Caesar's arrogance, which would contribute to the demise of the Republic.  He wrote, He wasted all the power of his intellect, and in him it was the highest, in pandering to popular humors.  Thus, having no regard to the Senate and to good men, he opened for himself that path to the extension of his power, which the manly spirit of a free people could not endure.  Cicero was acutely aware that a free people with a robust sense of justice would resent the creeping intrusion of totalitarianism.  How was he rewarded for his warnings, his literary prowess, and gifts to the culture?  His head and hand were hacked off and displayed prominently in Rome.  I don't want to sound like I'm comparing YouTubers and modern political pundits to some of the world's greatest thinkers.  The point I'm trying to make is that throughout history, and especially in times of cultural collapse, there has been a grave price associated with prescience.  The price used to be much higher.  You would be executed, perhaps your entire family as well, or spend your life in a forced labor camp or a cell.  There's a fair amount of persecution going on right now.  And although imprisonment is becoming a more prominent aspect of the left's reaction to the culture war, their tactics are still primarily limited to character assassination and attacking one's income stream.  Generally, in this day and age, we aren't going to get killed, at least not yet, just severely ostracized, otherized and exiled from marketplaces, virtual and otherwise.  This is exactly what is happening with Martin Sellner.  He has been raided multiple times with beyond flimsy cause.  Of course, the real cause is being an effective European nationalist.  Generation identity is dangerous.  because it is filled with clean-cut, well-spoken nationalists who use visual, very persuasive tactics to make obvious points about the degradation of European cultures.  The New Zealand shooter made a relatively sizable donation to Martin over a year ago, If you haven't seen my video about Christchurch and the shooter's motivations and intent, it's linked below.  But I believe that Tarrant had this plan in the works for many years.  I think he even stated so in his manifesto.  And this donation was an aspect of his attempt to hasten the culture war and to precipitate civil unrest in all Western nations.  He was able to rely on the predictability of the legacy media, of leftist governments, of overreaching Western politicians to do his bidding.  after his murders set everything in motion.  And they did not disappoint.  He wanted gun ownership to be restricted to cause conflict between pro and anti-gun communities in Western countries.  He wanted PewDiePie to be blamed by the mainstream media so the culture war would escalate.  He wanted Candace Owens to be slandered to ensnare the Black community in this culture war.  And I firmly believe he wanted to cause waves in Europe as well.  He found a way to hit basically every Western nation.  Generation identity is well-respected and nonviolent.  They discuss issues like migration that plague Europe and cause massive problems to have manifested even in small towns.  The price of mass migration is now plain to see, completely visible for virtually all Europeans.  As such, groups like Generation Identity can no longer be ignored or painted as part of the lunatic fringe.  Frankly, they've grown to be beloved by Europeans that feel trapped by the EU and are forced to bear witness to the destruction of their cultures.  By making a sizable donation to Martin, Tarrant knew that the media would pick up on this and claim that they were associated, which is patently absurd.  I shouldn't have to say this, but Martin clearly has no association with Tarrant or the shooting.  The media coverage on this has been appalling and nothing short of slanderous.  Is there an Austrian link to the New Zealand mosque attacks?  The suspect visited Austria from November 27th to December 4th last year.  Potential links to Austrian extremists were being looked into.  Police have searched the house of the charismatic, social media savvy leader Martin Sellner, who has done much to raise the profile of the identitarians throughout Europe.  The group is hostile to multiculturalism and claims to defend Europe against migrants, especially Muslims.  The implication here is obviously that Tarrant went to Austria to meet with Martin, who they paint like a psychopath.  I shouldn't have to say this either, but this obviously never happened.  The author doesn't outright make this claim, surely because of the fear of a lawsuit.  Later in the article, the author draws all sorts of parallels that are even more vague, suggesting that a shared interest in Austrian history further connects them.  It's absurd.  The fact of the matter is that receiving a donation does not a connection make.  As YouTubers, we get donations very often, anonymous donations, all the time.  We accept the donations gratefully and say thank you, and we never seek any information about the donor, and doing so would be insane and impossible.  We almost never know anything about the donors.  The media, once again, are playing right into Taryn's hands with their treatment of Martin.  Further, they're showing others of an accelerationist mindset that these tactics are very effective and that targets can be implicated in vague ways, such as a mere donation.  BBC and all of the outlets engaged in the slander are not only vindicating Tarrant, but they're increasing the likelihood of a future similar event.  I think they know this, but their thirst to destroy nationalists outweighs any concern that they may have about future slaughters.  If you're vocal about issues facing our countries, about civilizational decline and the causes about preserving Western cultures, you run the risk of losing your ability to move freely in society, to have a normal job, to have a good reputation.  In cases like Martin's, you run the risk of being blamed internationally for a horrific crime of which you clearly had no part.  So I guess the question is, should we do the right thing?  Should we pay a great personal expense, allow ourselves to be vilified, likely for our entire lives?  never experiencing vindication.  Minds greater than ours didn't prevent the fall of Rome.  Nobody really wants to hear the truth because there are so many creature comforts, even for the poorest amongst us, so much elaborate distraction to take us away from our lives.  Bread and circuses, bread and circuses.  In times like these, when people are so resistant to seeing the truth of our cultural decline, recognizing the insidious mission of our leftist overlords, from our perspective, things seem really bleak.  But we have no idea how many people have woken up if they aren't being vocal.  The situation could be far more promising than it appears.  And that's the nature of seeing these truths.  You can't for a while.  Then you won't.  But then you do.  And once you do, the world looks different.  You evaluate situations more carefully, more skeptically.  And there's no going back to your slumber.  It's a heinous realization, but it does give me some solace that there are likely tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of conscious, aware, but strategically silent people.  I understand the reticence involved with speaking truths at great personal expense.  I don't harbor resentments for your average individual with dependents and a normal job that is aware of the situation but doesn't blow up their life to vocalize these issues.  We all have duties to family and personal responsibility that must be observed.  Yet it must be done and somebody has to do it.  And the more people that do, the safer the rest of us are and the greater the likelihood that we miraculously come out of this nosedive, but more likely, effectively brace ourselves for a softer landing.  I've decided that the solution is for each and every one of us to push the conversation as far as we possibly can in our own lives without blowing everything up.  People like Martin and Britney are so important because they've already accepted this grave personal risk and have the perspective and the resilience to weather the kind of pressure that being blatantly lied about by the world media creates.  Generation Identity is in danger of being branded a terrorist organization, and I'm sure that they and Martin need your support now more than ever.  Martin has been banned from private banks from virtually every donation service.  The left wants him to be immobilized and defeated by drying up his income source.  We cannot let this happen.  At this point in time, he can only receive donations through his private bank.  I've added his donation link and that of Generation Identity in the description below.  A few years ago in a video, I said that we were going to face an ever-escalating, panicked series of reactions from the left as a response to various externalities, things like terrorist attacks or corruption being laid bare,  etc.,  etc.  That's definitely what's been happening and the leftist response to Christchurch has solidified this wounded animal style of response.  Their reactions are awakening people and in turn, awakening the masses is causing the left to lash out more erratically.  Largely, the war of ideas has been lost, which explains the leftist crackdowns.  There are a few notable things that some independently may seem trivial in the cultural climate, but have compounded severe distrust for the media, for the government, and have further sowed the seeds of unrest.  First, this college bribery scandal.  We all knew this was happening, but it has been an absolute death blow for academic influence, which is the primary mechanism of Marxist indoctrination of the youth.  Now your average American can see that these institutions, their birthright, have been completely hijacked by the leftist elite.  A college degree, even from the most prestigious institutions in America, doesn't mean shit anymore.  Since student loan debt is at an all-time high in the coming years, I think we can expect the complete collapse of academia.  Other news in American hypocrisy is the Jussie Smollett saga, where a gay black actor can orchestrate a massive hoax hate incident, waste a tremendous amount of essential resources, then be released with virtually no consequences because of his connections.  This one is particularly damaging to the left because it destroys multiple victim narratives.  It shows that no combination of minority status is truly discriminated against in the United States, that racism here is not really an issue, and must be manufactured.  Further, it shows preferential treatment for those with such statuses who, like very rich white leftists, enjoy the very same freedom to avoid prosecution, irrespective of the crime, if they line the right pockets.  Exposing a tiered justice system is extremely dangerous for the elite.  In terms of the media, they were already facing unprecedented levels of public skepticism towards their claims.  They totally played into the New Zealand shooter's hands, which is obvious to your average Westerner.  As I mentioned, it also exposes that the media cares far less about preventing future mass murders than about using every available opportunity to slander nationalists.  In Europe, Article 11 and 13 will have crippling effects on alternative media sources.  Dave Colon has made a number of videos about this that I've linked below.  This is from Zero Hedge.  The corporate oligarchs are in fear for their projects.  They want desperately to maintain control.  They've worked for decades to evolve the nation-state into the new, shiny transnational super-state the EU exemplifies.  The new copyright directive is designed to erect barriers to entry and shut down opposition speech by outsourcing the enforcement to the platforms hosting the material.  And to top off this international crackdown on information flow, we have book bannings.  Roosh, Jared Taylor, Kevin MacDonald have had books banned from Amazon, which has a near monopoly on internet book sales.  Meanwhile, all sorts of antifa and instructional jihadist material still remains.  What we're seeing is the simultaneous destruction of our once-trusted institutions as they desperately try to control the narrative using censorship, corrupt government processes, and the remaining scraps of public trust in the failing mainstream media in order to try to tamp down the civil unrest that is boiling over in the West.  Becca Lewis, notorious for her obsessive take on alternative media, tweeted this amidst the coverage of Martin Sellner.  This is why it's not just guilt by association to call out people for having such friendly chats with these guests.  By giving it a platform, the hosts explicitly amplify and normalize bigoted rhetoric, and they make money in the process.  To people like Becca Lewis and other stooges of Soros desperate to create six degrees of separation between everyone on the right and Hitler, to those who try to destroy our personal lives our income streams our reputations there is no stopping this and based on your desperate behavior i think you know this even if you do us in as individuals it's just like playing whack-a-mole in perpetuity and every time you do it successfully you just awaken someone younger someone stronger someone smarter.  it's futile And I think most importantly, you can't stop us from experiencing the beauty of life.  Brittany and Martin are clearly happy people that have each other.  They have millions of supporters.  They have a strong network of friends and family.  They're free in their hearts and minds, no matter how they're persecuted.  And you will pay not only for your lack of courage in this time of cultural upheaval, but for actively working against those that were trying to prevent violence on a mass scale in the West.  You'll be viewed by history, if you're even remembered, as a malevolent influence being used by corrupt institutions to do their globalist bidding.  I never know how to end my more serious videos, so I'll just say thanks, folks, and I'll see you soon.  Bye. ",
