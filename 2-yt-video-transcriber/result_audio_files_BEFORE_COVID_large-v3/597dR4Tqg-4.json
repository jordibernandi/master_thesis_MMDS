The campaign group have organised impressive marches and got vast media attention, but it's unclear.  they've persuaded many leaders, i.e.  the people they actually need to get onside.  What's more, they seem obsessed with Jeremy Corbyn.  And high-profile pundits and politicians have successfully portrayed the Labour leader as a dogmatic Eurosceptic, and pretty much the only person standing in the way of a second vote.  But this is nonsense, and the likes of Alistair Campbell have got Remainers barking up the wrong tree.  Labour's position is pragmatic, not ideological.  If there was an overwhelming majority in the public in favour of a second referendum and reversing Brexit, I'm sure Labour would fall in line.  But that's simply not the world we're living in. ",

With many of those in leave seats, there aren't enough in favour of a people's vote.  I'm not going to pretend Jeremy Corbyn is an ardent Remainer.  His focus is to implement socialist policies that can rescue Britain from the ruinous path pursued by the Tories.  And that's possible inside or outside of the EU.  Labour have pursued a Brexit that minimises economic fallout.  On Wednesday, they reaffirmed their commitment to staying in a customs union and keeping close to the single market.  Labour are rightly focused on building bridges between people who voted Leave and people who voted Remain.  They don't want to spend the next decade fighting a culture war about the EU.

When the other options are all looked at and when they're examined and when they fall and when they fail in Parliament, and I suspect that this attempt to Corbyn-May tie-up is going to fail, I could be wrong, but I think it will, that then I think the people's vote comes very much back into play.
