            "text": "black ram d13 back at it again.  you know why.  it's because this is therapeutic man.  back again with another video hence another therapy session.  today's topic and title is who hurt you which is her favorite line jumping right into it.  here we go.  all you do is talk about winning.  We ain't got nothing good to say.  But you guys are just bitter.  Like, who hurt you?  Anytime the succubi hears a critique of her character, a rebuke of her often immoral behavior, a critical analysis of the current dating game in which men discuss their disdain for the choices that are available in the dating game when it comes to the female.  Any critique of the terrible wife or girlfriend that the succubi tends to be is met by her main statement is, Uh-oh, girl.  Now this guy is just bitter.  Like, who hurt you?  If I had a dime for every time I've heard that statement from the Simpson succubi alike, I'd be a rich man.  It's their default argument, their go to argument, because no argument against the subject that is presented can be made in a rational, reasonable way.  So since she has no rebuttal that can be made and because she has nothing substantial to say, all she can say is who hurt you.  This is not, repeat, this is not a reasonable argument whatsoever.  But in her mind, it always is, shows you how deep her mind goes, shallow as a drop of rain.  Now notice, no matter where she is from in the United States, no matter her age, this is her default argument.  Although these women have never met each other, they say the exact same thing.  This is a perfect example of the hive mind.  They think exactly the same.  If you've met one, you've met them all.  Nothing new here to see at all, but the same old illogical argument, which is not an argument at all.  So let's explore here the reasons why she frequently uses this non sequitur.  Who hurt you?  Let's get into it.  She thinks men are like women mentally and emotionally.  Her thoughts and her opinions are always subjective.  She can't think outside of her own personal experience.  She believes that all life on earth.  are just background music, is just background music and props to her own life.  She's a star in a living movie.  She's the center now of the universe.  Therefore, the life experience of others can be explained and concluded in light of her own experiences.  In other words, if it feels or has the potential to feel a certain way to her, Then this must also be the same feelings of all sentient life on Earth.  Her subjectivity is also your objective reality.  Ridiculous.  Dumb, ditty, dumb, dumb, dumb.  The creature is completely dumb.  As to the reason why she uses this argument, who hurt you, is because she is not intelligent enough to make a logical argument against the things that we speak upon in this community.  The creature is not smart at all.  The succubus is dumb as dumb can get.  In fact, she is the dumbest thing on God's green.  The reasonings and the ramblings of the creature is usually on a first or second grade level at best.  For the succubus, yeah, it can parent information, but the creature cannot reason whatsoever.  This is why silence is always preferred when the creature is present.  Is this why Apostle Paul called for the creatures to keep silent in the assembly and never to teach the congregants?  Is this the reason?  No intelligence with only a few and very rare exceptions.  Part C. as to the reason why she uses the argument.  Who hurt you is because she indeed is projecting.  She's the one who is hurt and bitter.  So she can only reference her own subjective experience.  So she can only reference herself since it is impossible for her to put herself in other shoes because she is so selfish and solipsistic.  She has not the ability now to be objective.  She is accusing others of everything that she is guilty of.  she is the one that's bitter and she is the one who is hurt.  she is the one who cannot pair bond.  she's the one who has a 100 failure rate in all her relationships.  so she's the one that's bitter due to her own choices.  part d As to the reason why she uses her favorite line, who hurt you, is because that she has no understanding that an objective observation can be made.  She has no clue that this is possible.  So with this ideology, her conclusions are just delusions.  She doesn't understand that.  With objective information, decisions can be made, conclusions can be had.  This idea is too radical for the succubi.  The small, underdeveloped brain of this creature can't comprehend this concept.  That there is such a thing as being objective.  And in being objective, one has to eliminate personal bias and think outside of themselves and make observations and report the findings.  This is impossible for the succubi.  for the creature again is self-absorbed and egomaniac.  that can only think and reference itself perpetually and eternally.  It's self-centeredness has no limits.  Science is all about observations, unbiased and recorded observations that can be repeated.  This is what we talk about here.  My channel is about observations that can be repeated over and over again.  You can make the same observations.  I can too.  We can collect the data.  But she has no. ",
