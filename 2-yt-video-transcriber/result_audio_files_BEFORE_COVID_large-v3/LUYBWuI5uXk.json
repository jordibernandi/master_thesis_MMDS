It might never even fully go away.  But there is so much you can do to make your life better.  The first step to a better life is bettering yourself.  Miracles don't exist, so stop hoping for one.  Start taking care of yourself.  Clean your room.  Quit caffeine.  Go to sleep at an acceptable time.  Start working out.  Find a long-lasting goal.  Get a hobby.  Face your fears and stop giving a fuck, etc.  The key to happiness is to constantly work on yourself and be a better version every day.  You are the person in control, so shut the fuck up and take care of yourself, you pussy. ",
