But here I am, the British atheist living in India with his ex-Hindu Brahmin fianc\u00e9.  I even attended a wedding last Friday, and funnily enough, it was the wedding of an atheist friend.  Both myself and Udita met at one of our Atheist, Feminist and Three Fingers meets we used to organise.  That was until they became the fortnightly Dungeons & Dragons sessions I currently run.  So anyway, today's video is a response to Shankar Shandas and his videos titled, Atheism is Blind Faith Dogmatism and Atheists Have Got It All Wrong.  Now I know some other people have already responded to the second video since I found it and downloaded it, but I still wanted to do them myself.  There's not a whole lot of concise Hindu content here on YouTube.  Though I am stretching the word concise here, as you're likely already aware.  So yeah, let's get down to business.  Starting with atheism is blind faith dogmatism. ",

This process, known as nucleosynthesis, varies from star to star.  Small stars can turn hydrogen into helium, medium stars can do the same, but can also turn helium into carbon and oxygen.  Huge stars also have this trait, but can go a step further and can form neon, sodium, magnesium, sulfur, and silicon, as well as calcium, iron, nickel, chromium, copper, and many, many more.  As for the idea that said hydrogen was just there, that's not really accurate.  We've got observable evidence of an event known as the Big Bang, the expansion of all matter from a point of singularity to the current universal state.  And it's something that's still going on.  Beyond said singularity, we don't know much.  But we are trying to find out, and there are various naturalistic hypotheses currently being tested.  But nowhere is God even mentioned amongst said explanations.  Now why do you think that is? ",

We do not have the same knowledge about the universe and its origins.  Again, it's something we're working on.  And whilst we don't have all the answers, everything we've written so far has been purely naturalistic.  So that's the evidence we do have.  Purely naturalistic processes.  Is it then reasonable to assume some unnatural event or entity?  played some role?  No!  That's the very antithesis of reason, inventing stuff in the absence of knowledge, stuff which can't be tested or verified in a peer-reviewed fashion.  So your analogy is bogus.  A better yet still not perfect one would be looking at a bioluminescent fish and you arguing that this must have a human origin due to our understanding of light and electricity.  even though there's actually no electricity present, and we have prior knowledge of non-electrical light sources.

I'm not even asking for evidence of God, especially not your God in particular.  The supernatural is a hurdle enough, I feel.  So if you could show that first, we'll take that and process that before moving on to the next step.  Oh.  That's the whole video, apparently.  So, uh, no.  You don't have all reason and logic on your side.  You have the assertion that you do.  But nothing to show for said assertion.  And that's a little disappointing, but... Oh well, I'll live I guess.  I've also seen no evidence of atheistic dogmatism in the rejection of your assertion that a god exists.  Since you, as with every other theist out there, has failed to supply evidence of god, that's actually the only philosophically honest position to maintain at current.  I am fully open to accepting evidence of god.  if it's evidence that stands to scrutiny.  If you simply go, well, we don't understand process X, Y, or Z, therefore God, that's not an actual argument.  This is simply the God of the Gaps argument and appeal to ignorance, which is not that impressive.  All it does is show that you don't know your shit.
