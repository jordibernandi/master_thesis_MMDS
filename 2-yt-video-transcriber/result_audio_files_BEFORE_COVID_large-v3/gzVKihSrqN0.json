We are both marginalized in the mainstream.  Look at me.  You are maybe young enough not to remember this.  until six, seven years ago.  I almost regularly published op-eds in New York Times.  Now I'm totally prohibited there.  Then even the left, in these times, the Chicago Journal, totally prohibited.  I had an incorrect stance on refugees and so on.  Prohibited.  So did you notice this, that the only medium in the United States where they publish me, it's a very marginal digital one.  It's the... Los Angeles Review of Books Philosophical Salon.  I'm out. ",

They think they are the center of the world.  They are not.  But what to say, the same thing happened in the UK, Guardian.  Up till three years ago, I was regularly there, almost at least every second week.  Now I'm totally prohibited.  Even the leftist, London Review of Books, the New Left Review, I'm prohibited.  I'm now totally in this.  So I laughed at this, two titans, but I'm even more marginalized.  Now, why I did it?  I did it, the main reason I accepted it.  One was purely narcissistic.  He challenged me, and then you know, anytime, anywhere, whatever.  And I got many replies from people, oh, you chickened out, are you afraid, and so on.  I just wanted to prove, sorry guys, I am not afraid.  Second thing is a much more subtle one.  I think that as it's always the problem with our most radical and effective enemies, we They hit a grain of truth.  You know, that's also my formula of fake lies.  Fake lies are most dangerous when they incorporate into their narrative elements of truth.  So, like, incidentally, but I don't want to go into it.

He really deals with individuals who suffer, who are self-destroyed, and tries to somehow make them functioning again.  This is quite an honorable thing to do, you know, because you know all those leftists who claim how moral decay or drugs is part of our culture, they like to do big social analysis, but are you ready?  Did they ever see really a self-destroyed guy day?  there, you know, so, but no, so no, don't, you know, we afterwards, we had a quarter of an hour of a chat, and we established that.  what surprised, he also told me that many of his fans were furious at him, like, why didn't you grind me, him, and to me also, like, all left, I got dozens of left emails, like, why didn't you screw his mother of that microphone?  I said, no, that was the beauty.  It was absolutely clear how different we are.  So there was no need to rehash that point, you know. ",

He likes to say, read more, I read.  For example, he quote Solzhenitsyn.  My God, was he ever in Russia?  Every honest Russian will tell you, Solzhenitsyn was a pathetic fake.
