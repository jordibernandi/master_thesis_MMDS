So these were notes that were taken before the FISA was gotten on Carter Page in the fall of 16.  So this is a couple weeks before.  In those notes that were not provided to Congress, we now see not only does the State Department not believe Christopher Steele, the Clinton campaign operative, because he thinks that there's actually a Russian consulate in Miami, it also has the sources.  Now, who is one of these sources?  One of the sources is one of the equivalent of the CIA director, former CIA director in Moscow, for the Russian government.  Now, think about that.  Do we really think that a former CIA director equivalent in Russia would be working with our intelligence community and be some kind of asset? ",

So those are sitting.  The Attorney General has our concerns.  We assume that that will be given to the new U.S.  attorney that's been assigned to get to the bottom of this.  And then look, we'll just keep pilling things back.  So as more evidence comes out, we'll continue to grab that evidence and we'll analyze it and we'll make referrals to the Justice Department.
