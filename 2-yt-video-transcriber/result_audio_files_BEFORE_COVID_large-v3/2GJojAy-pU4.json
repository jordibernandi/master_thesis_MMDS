            "text": "Aren't there, everyone?  I'm in the beautiful Pocono Mountains.  My family has a get-together here every year, and it's just a wonderful time.  Very lovely vacation, relaxation, holiday, and the like.  But I just can't keep away from you guys.  And so I wanted to weigh in really quickly on President Trump's comments about Baltimore.  I lived in Baltimore, downtown Baltimore, for a number of years, nearly a decade.  And I'd like to give my two cents here.  I don't know how many of you have been following the latest controversy now over President Trump's comments, and this time it's not about the squad anymore.  It's about Congressman Elijah Cummings.  who represents the city of Baltimore.  Trump called Cummings a brutal bully when it comes to his attitude towards border control officials and the whole border issue in general.  And then he turned and criticized the Baltimore district that he represents as a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess where no human would ever want to live.  And Trump complained that Cummings is constantly shouting and screaming at the great men and women of Border Patrol about the conditions of the southern border.  when you turn around and you look at the conditions that are far worse in his own Baltimore district that he represents, which is considered one of the worst in the United States.  Now, immediately, I mean, you don't have to be a genius to figure out, Trump hadn't even finished his final word before the cultural Marxist alliance between the Democrats and in Congress and the corporatist globalist media began accusing the president of rabid, abject racism.  Here Trump goes again, raging and screaming about a congressman of color, it's his racism, it's racism at its absolute worst, we need to impeach this president, impeach, impeach.  And as I've often said, there are only two things the Democrats have right now for 2020, and that's racism in Russia.  Right.  That's it.  And of course, the whole Russia thing is falling apart with the Mueller fiasco.  So all that now they have is basically.  racism and their mouthpieces in the corporatist globalist media are having their all too predictable meltdowns over all this.  I mean, CNN actually went so far as to claim that when President Trump called Baltimore a rat infested city, he was actually talking about the black and brown people that live there.  I think Baltimore is like, you know, 80 percent African-American.  I mean, that's the most trusted name in news, right, is CNN, the Clown News Network.  He's actually talking about African-Americans.  But Trump is getting a lot of support in turn, particularly from conservatives who are coming out and putting forward a drudged up Bernie Sanders comments that were made in Baltimore a couple of years back.  where Sanders called Baltimore a third world city.  And he wanted, walking around the city, he claimed could not possibly conclude that we live in a wealthy nation.  We would think that we were living in a third world country.  Half the people don't have jobs.  Hundreds of the buildings there are uninhabitable.  And Sanders went on to call it a disgrace.  Specifically, he said it was a disgrace.  that the residents of Baltimore's poorest boroughs have lifespans shorter than those who are living under the dictatorship of North Korea.  This is coming from Bernie Sanders.  And isn't it interesting that no one that I know of ever accused him of racism?  Well, then I guess if you're a Marxist... Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  If you're a social democrat, I guess you're allowed to talk that way.  You're allowed... Look... Let me give you a window into what's going on here as best as I understand it.  There are two angles I think we need to view Trump's comments from, okay?  So first and foremost, as someone who lived there, Trump is right.  Baltimore is a hellhole, okay?  The BBC featured Baltimore in its report on poverty in America, right?  They featured houses that were in fact rat infested within Baltimore.  The neighborhoods are falling apart.  Their city schools are ranked among the lowest in the state.  of Maryland, if not the nation.  And the life expectancy is.  in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods, which includes, by the way, Elijah Cummings District, they have life expectancies that are 20 years below the national average.  Todd Starnes over at Fox News points out that according to pest control statistics, Baltimore is in fact one of the single most rat-infested cities in In the United States, it ranks six overall.  And as he notes, all the top 10 rat infested cities, they are all controlled and dominated by the Democrats.  So that's why we can call them the demo rats, right?  In terms of crime and violence, Baltimore is deadlier than Chicago and Detroit, according to the crime statistics chronicled by the FBI.  And it's had the nation's highest murder rate back in 2018.  And so when President Trump calls Baltimore a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess, in all due respect, he is absolutely correct.  And here's the thing.  Everybody knows it.  at least everyone who's been to Baltimore or any one of our Democratic-run disaster zone cities, as anyone knows, I mean, I lived in Baltimore for nearly 10 years.  I saw this all firsthand.  I remember, actually, I'll tell you a story.  I remember voting at one of the elections.  It was back in the 1994 election, the congressional midterm elections, when the Republicans took the House back for the first time in 40 years, you know, the Gingrich Revolution, and And I was living in Baltimore City, and I was excited to go out and vote.  It was actually the first time I'd ever voted in an election.  I was in my early 20s or so, and I was excited to vote down the line Republican.  I was really fired up.  And I showed up at the polling station, which was at the Enoch Pratt Library.  This is in the Mount Vernon area of downtown Baltimore.  So I showed up.  I wait in line.  And when I got to the registration table, they asked me my name.  And I said, you know, Steve Turley.  And the lady is looking through this massive, massive notebook of registrations.  And she's just going through page after page.  And she flips through this hulk of a book.  And she gets to the T section.  And she can't find my name.  And she asks me my name again.  I spell it out for her.  She double checks this massive notebook.  Can't find me anywhere.  And then she has to see my voting registration card, okay, which I gave to her.  And I kid you not, I kid you not, she looks at me and she goes, she looks at the card and goes, oh, you're a Republican.  And she turns around and she takes out this little tiny tin 3x5 card container, flips through just a few of the cards in there and takes out my name.  That's Baltimore.  It's a one-party city.  Like all other major cities, it's a monopoly.  It's a one-party city that has become nothing more than a total and complete hellhole over the course of the last several decades under Democratic control.  And I've seen it firsthand, and President Trump could not possibly be more accurate.  And that leads me to the second point in all this.  That's the second angle we need to understand his comments on.  And you all know this, right?  If you've been following this channel, we've talked about this over the last couple of weeks.  There's a very clear strategy, very clear political strategy to what President Trump is doing here.  And what he's doing is he's slowly but methodically recasting the Democratic Party as the party of the squad and the party of failed, rat-infested cities.  He's making people like Elijah Cummings and Ilhan Omar the faces of the Democratic Party.  And it's politically brilliant.  All you have to do is look at how the Democrats are reacting to all this.  Are the Democrats coming out and saying, oh, really, Mr.  President?  Well, let's check your facts.  And then all the fact checkers come out, right?  No, Baltimore is in point of fact a pristine and beautiful city.  It has some of the highest living standards in the world.  Is that what they're saying?  Of course not.  Of course all they can do is rush to the racism charge.  How dare you?  How dare you make such racist comments attacking a congressman of color and attacking the good people of Baltimore?  Blah, blah, blah.  Forget the logical problem, by the way, right?  This is a problem of what's called ad hominem attacks.  Even if Trump were a racist, you know, racist can be right too, you know.  Racists can read the facts and the data regarding Baltimore and conclude that it is, in fact, a rat-infested disaster.  That's the problem with so-called ad hominem, logical fallacies, attacking the man rather than the argument, but nevertheless.  I think Trump knows what he's doing.  He knows he's right.  He's seen the data.  He knows what everyone else knows, right?  Particularly what Democrats know.  They know he's right.  That Baltimore is an absolute mess, an absolute disaster of a city.  And because of that, the Democrats are once again in the position of having to defend their own political disasters, their own political failures.  First, it was the squad.  First, it was Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar.  And now it's Baltimore.  And of course, Trump is further attacking Al Sharpton, who everyone knows is a huckster and a charlatan.  So I think it's very clear what Trump is doing here.  He's continuing his strategy over the last couple of weeks of making the most radical and failed leftist politicians the new faces of the Democratic Party.  And as far as I'm concerned, more power to him.  He is going where no Republican was willing to go before.  God bless him for it.  All right, that's it.  Back to my vacation.  Hope to see you soon a couple more times this week.  God bless. ",
