Now, now people are wondering, wait, so are we going to conflict with Venezuela or are we going to conflict with Rylan?  Or are we possibly preparing for a conflict with all of them?  Is this the next WW3?  Like, this is like some big stuff.  now some people actually think that I'm not saying that but what I am saying is we take it day by day here and we are following every tip that we get.  so please make sure to get on those alerts because we are going to send things out.  the second it happens US polls non-essential staff from rye yak amid mid east tensions.  now this is what I was saying.  now some people got the thumbnail confused And what they saw was all flights suspended.  That was actually Venezuela.  All flights are suspended to Venezuela.  We're talking about passenger and cargo flights.  This is the other part.  that is happening at the exact same time.  Meanwhile, we have the USS Abraham Lincoln, which many say, in fact, our sources say once it gets there, it's game on.  So, basically, we are pulling people out of Riyadh.  We are canceling all flights to Venezuela.  Something big is going on.  And that's why I said, by now, you would almost have to be an idiot to think there's nothing going on behind the scenes.  U.S.  intel showed Iran-backed militias moving rockets in Riyadh.  Now, check this out.  It says in... The current wrapping up of U.S.  military posturing against Rylan was triggered by U.S.  intelligence that showed Tehran-backed militias in Riyadh moving rockets to locations that could hit bases where American troops were positioned in the nation, according to sources familiar with the intelligence.  T-Man administration officials have said that the Pentagon's bumping up the deployment last week of a U.S.  aircraft carrier and bomber group to the region was justified by intelligence on threats of a potentially imminent, they use the word imminent, attack by RILAN on U.S.  interests in RILAC.  but have provided no specific details publicly.  Now, of course, they did not publicly display these things.  These things are all either going on behind the scenes or they don't exist.  Rylan vows to defeat American Zionists Alliance, which, by the way, that word, if you call in, please, that Z word is now a filtered word.  They don't want people saying that.  Now, of course, I try to say whatever we can and get creative.  That's all we got to do.  We have to have a code.  We're saying that word, but we're not saying that word, if you know what I mean.  We are also going to put things like that in our alerts.  It says they vow to defeat American Z. Alliance as Putin warns U.S.  pressure against U.S.  pressure.  So also Russia is backing these guys up.  And they said even more than ever, we have military sources saying that Putin is in every.  picture like this is literally us against Rylan and at least Russia.  It says Rylan will defeat the American and Israeli alliance.  Rylan's minister of defense, Amir Hatami, said on Wednesday.  So this isn't some sort of intern saying we're going to defeat us.  It's the minister of defense, the guy in charge.  Hello, you are live on Marfugal TV.  What is going on? ",

But we've got a lot of movement going on and all over the place.  And I think it coincides with a lot of the mainstream articles we've already discussed.  So in particular, you know, a lot of the words we're getting from inside sources are the same thing.  Get your gas, get your water, get supplies, get prepped, make sure you're ready.  I think you mentioned earlier once Abe Lincoln gets to its final destination, that's when things are going to get going.  And I think that was sort of the overall message I'm hearing.  Specifically, though, what we've seen with movements, there's been two massive trains loaded down with generators and rigs and lighting rigs, all moving east.  I don't have an actual location on that.  I don't want to give that out.  But there are also multiple reportings of helos, helicopters, all, again, in the general area.  have been, we've seen them spotted heading east in different directions, but here's an interesting story.  We had one of two large troop carriers, and this actually was in Ellington Field in Texas, South Texas, two different large troop carriers that landed for a short time and then took off again headed east.  They were actually followed, and I guess they were probably escorted with six different jets, either F-35s or F-18s, again, all headed east.  There's been B-1 bombers flying in South Dakota, again, mostly flying east.  And I think, yeah, I think that's the gist of it.  And then you go back to like a lot of the stories that you talked about today, you know, the evacuations in Rayak and the things that are happening in Venezuela, as well as recent power outages in Venezuela.  And also Germany, Netherlands canceled exercises today due to U.S.  actions in the I country.  So a lot of things going on.  Again, I want to be really quick because I want to get on to other callers, but I did want to get this information out.  I thought it was really important.  ExxonMobil has evacuated their personnel from RIAC.  And I just heard moments ago that there's been three Sky King messages today. ",

            "text": "Hey, Adam, how you doing?  Hey, I just wanted to, I know it's the end of the show, and I just wanted to add a quick little couple somethings.  One thing, I just want to tell everybody how important they are to all the hard work that you guys all do, and just wanted them to know just all how important it is because there's so much going on right now that it really does lead us to... directions to go to dig for more with a lot of the connections we have.  So I just can't tell you how important that is and how it led us to some really amazing stuff.  I think that's the reason why this show is so big today.  I also wanted to fill you in too, that about the time Dex, I wasn't able to come on and he shared that stuff.  I was watching the show and it started buffering really heavy.  And then my screen went to the dim phase where it says, live stream offline and I had to actually get logged back on and it was Dex too that was talking.  so you know he's real careful with what he says but they just keep adding more stuff.  I was blown away with the size of the list.  so yes that is important that everybody really think about and be creative what they're saying because we want to get the truth out there but they're listening with it.  the thing is this wasn't your computer overheating?  because when I got re-logged back in you were still up and running.  So, and I wanted to add too, besides that, I wanted to let you know, I know that Dex had touched base really quick on the Sky, we'll call them Sky Queen messages just in case.  Um, and there were three of them that did come through.  The interesting thing I got to looking into those a little bit more after passing along to Dex was when they came in, when they came in, it was basically right before the show started or right as the show started.  And, uh, the dates on them were reading the 16th of May, and it wasn't even the 16th of May yet.  Yeah, the first one read at 03.34, so, you know, 3.30 in the morning, 3.45 in the morning, and 3.50 in the morning.  That would put those messages, after especially we were talking with Dex, we figured that that puts those messages right about in the Middle Eastern area, If you know what I'm saying. ",

Wyoming NG is going to the Middle East.  The Alaska NG is going to Coast EV.  Bangor, Maine NG is going to the land of poles.  And this one really kind of got me.  This sounds like WW3.  Yeah, and the Coast Guard, which is meant for, you know, guarding our coast.  The Coasties have... been pushed down deeper into the Pacific theater is what they call it, which is basically just down South in the Pacific ocean.  Um, and the coasties also have been, uh, shipped heavy over to Africa and there are some coastie ships in to China, to chain team night, you know what I mean?

And the only reason that we bring things like this up is so that we know what's going on and where maybe we need to help out because if those people are distracted elsewhere, we have a lot of things here at home like floods and dams and and weather and things like that of people that need help, which is normally where those people help.
