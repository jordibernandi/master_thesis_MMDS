            "text": "Hey folks, it's Patriot Nurse.  Today I'm going to tell you why we are not going to vote our way out of this next civil war.  So if you're like me, whenever you see the news or basically anytime you wake up and check the headlines against your better judgment, it's pretty much constant reminder that every morning we wake up, we're less and less free.  As long as people like Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, whatever her name is, as long as they are running their mouths.  and considering that bernie on the heels of this new zealand thing in a tweet basically he said that banning semi-automatic firearms and high capacity magazines which is a joke it's like if it's over five rounds apparently somehow it's considered high capacity but basically that banning these things is the way to go which would mean essentially taking out of circulation the most commonly used firearms that free and law-abiding people use to defend themselves and their rights.  And so when it comes right down to it, folks, I don't think that we're going to vote our way out of this thing coming up.  In fact, I know we're not going to.  And the people that are trying to soothe, say, and tickle ears and say, oh, there's no civil war coming.  Oh, it's being overblown.  Now, listen, those people spend their entire days in front of video game consoles and like throwing tech and substances in their brains, right?  They're not living in a concrete world.  They're not living in a concrete reality.  where there are consequences in the physical realm for the actions of talk by our political leaders.  And I say that in jest.  When you have political leaders elected, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, when you have these types of people being elected, it's pretty clearly evidence to me that the electoral process serves at this point to only enrich people who want to take away our rights.  and to transfer wealth from productive people into the hands of non-productive people who will continue to propagate poverty and insist on more of our money and more of our rights to the point where we are stripped down to essentially nothing.  So I don't think that we're going to vote our way out of this thing.  And when it comes right down to it, with the laws that they're advocating, with these red flag gun bills that would essentially strip you of due process, that would, for instance, in the Senate Bill 7, I think it is, in the United States Senate, that would allow secret tribunals, if you will, a secret judge in a kangaroo court where an individual accused of being a threat or mentally unstable has no access to legal representation.  They have no right to confront their accuser.  Basically, there's no due process.  And when this is the status of things, when this is what is being proposed by elected officials, there's no way you're going to vote your way out of it.  And what's really startling a lot of people is seeing the trend in voting demographics and how they've changed and really what the voting base wants.  There is a reason why our founders insisted upon a constitutional republic as a form of government.  Because they recognized that eventually all governments consolidate power and they typically tend to consolidate it in the cities.  And the voting base in the cities tends to be one of dependence, where a mindset of dependence, where a mindset of trading Rights for security or rights for the illusion of equal prosperity is the norm and is the status of things.  So when you have a level of the populace and even from a numerical standpoint, a majority of that populace that is voting away not only the purse of their fellow citizens, but also the rights and especially the right to self-defense away from their citizens, there's no voting anymore.  So when it comes right down to it, Bernie can stand there and purport to ban all these firearms that he wants to ban.  And of course, AOC, whatever her name is, she can go along with that too.  But they're not going to be the ones that come get him.  Bernie's not going to put his safety and security on the line to come around people's houses and confiscate firearms, ban firearms, or register firearms.  They're all the same eventuality.  Somebody is going to have a shopping list to come and get your stuff.  But the politicians are not going to be the ones to do it.  And you're certainly not going to get justice in the courts nowadays because they have installed their own federal cronies in the places where you would seek the redress of your grievances naturally.  So there's not going to be any move from these politicians or from the judges coming and doing it.  No, they're going to use their cronies.  They're going to use their minions to come and try and take this stuff.  Whether it's their empowered masses, the rabble masses that they used to do it, or with the badge of government, that's what they would eventually move towards.  And I'm not going to give my stuff up.  And if you're like me, you're not going to do it either.  So eventually there's going to come a point where they keep voting, and eventually that vote is going to turn into action.  But I don't see that we're going to vote our way out of this.  And I'm not going to give up my stuff, so what are you going to do?  You going to come and get me?  Okay.  Whatever.  And there's a lot of people who are like this.  You're sitting there and you're looking at what they're saying, knowing that the eventuality of this is coming.  Vote or no vote.  They're going to eventually put their words into force.  And when they do, force is the only thing that will repel them and not votes.  If you are of this mindset and you know that it's coming, then I recommend that you get this book right here.  Resistance to Tyranny by Joseph B. Martino.  There's a lot of things I would like to say to you.  But YouTube, of course, is a censored platform.  And when it comes right down to it, I think that we all need to be considering the winds and where they blow at this point.  And I don't have any hope that this is going to be reconciled definitely on the federal level.  The best thing that we can hope for from a peaceful redress of grievances at this point is for the states to reassert themselves.  And thank God Missouri just passed a piece of legislation that essentially nullifies federal gun bills.  And that's a good thing.  That's a great place to start for sure.  But we're behind the power curve on this one and they know it.  They know it.  So the resolve is up to us at this point.  And I recommend getting that book.  Get that book for sure.  It has everything in it that I would like to say, but that I can't.  So no, I don't think that we're going to vote our way out of this.  I think it's going to come.  And I think that there's going to be a heavy amount of resolve, fortitude, and grit needed in the days to come.  I hope it was helpful for y'all.
