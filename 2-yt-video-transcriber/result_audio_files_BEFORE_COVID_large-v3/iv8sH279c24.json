            "text": "Hey there, Internet.  My name's Luxander, and it's Pride.  We're talking about Pride because it's Pride.  I'm not sure that I've actually ever talked about Pride before, because talking about Pride is one of those things that's kind of expected, and I don't generally do those.  I don't do, usually, a trans day of remembrance video.  I did one, I think, last year, just talking about my thoughts in general on it.  I'm gonna talk about Pride, but I'm gonna talk about it in the, you've seen the title, I wanna talk about who's welcome at Pride, what Pride means.  Those two things are related to each other, because what Pride is for, where it started, and what it means informs who should be at Pride, and like, this is discourse that's been going on on Twitter, so I want to talk about it, because this is the conversation that we're having right now.  But yeah, as a general statement first, I just want to say happy Pride to all of the queer folk out there.  The Pride event that happens in proximity to me, I didn't actually go.  It was this past weekend as of this recording.  It was the first weekend in June, and I had to work, and then I decided that I didn't want to go just on Sunday because it was hot outside.  I've never actually been to Pride before.  I want to talk about the discourse around Pride right now.  The discourse is, there are basically a few sticking points where some people are saying kink shouldn't be at Pride, or like, leather daddies make them uncomfortable at Pride, and then you have people who are saying that cops shouldn't be at Pride, and then you have people who are saying that asexual people or aromantic people shouldn't be at Pride.  And that last one at least is a question not only of do these people belong at Pride, but also is sort of analogous to do these people belong in the community.  I've seen a lot of conversation about whether or not asexual and aromantic people are part of the queer community.  I want to start with the question of whether or not cops belong at Pride, because to me this is one of the easiest questions to answer if you know anything about where Pride came from.  We have Pride in the summer as we do because it is commemorating the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, which was of course a situation in which police presence in queer communities in New York City was actively destructive, and the first Pride was a riot!  where trans women of color threw bricks at cops.  The existence of Pride is predicated on the adversarial relationship between law enforcement officers and the queer community and its ability to exist peacefully.  There is an extent to which any public, organized event that you have has to have police presence there for the sake of making sure that nothing outrageous happens.  I will grant that I am scared of the idea of there being a shooting at Pride, but I also can say that I don't feel like the presence of police would make the situation feel any safer.  Literally, unless there is a mass shooting, at Pride, the only thing that the police do there is essentially represent a threat of impending violence towards our community.  So the city that Pride is being held in is probably going to insist that there be officers present in the area, but I don't think that cops should be in Pride in the sense that there shouldn't be afloat for the local police department, and I don't think that they should have armed and uniformed officers walking among the people.  I don't think that that's good in any way, shape, or form, because the nature of Pride is inherently based on the adversarial relationship that exists there.  So yeah, the short answer to do cops belong at Pride is no.  Not unless they are in civilian clothes and refuse to participate in any police violence that may occur at the event.  I also want to address the idea that ace or aro people cannot be at Pride.  I'm gonna be the person who's gonna come out and unequivocally say that asexual and aromantic people are part of the queer community, and if you don't think that's the case, I disagree with you, and I think that you should actually talk to aspec people about their experiences, because they are also subject to things like people telling them that, like, they just need to try to be in a relationship with someone of a certain gender, which a lot of the other letters in the queer community have also dealt with.  Like, it is so clear to me that aspec people also experience the same kinds of confusion and depression, that I just really don't understand why people think that they're not part of the community.  If you are anything that is not heterosexual and or cisgender, then you're queer, and asexual people are not heterosexual, and aromantic people are not heteroromantic, so, eh, it follows, to me, that they're LGBT.  I thought that rhyme was cute.  I was gonna say queer, but then I thought it was gonna be adorable.  Was it cute?  Tell me.  The short answer from me on whether or not asexual and aromantic people belong at Pride is, obviously, yes, they do.  And if you don't agree with that, then I think the best thing for you to do would be to search for aromantic and asexual people's perspectives on the subject, listen to their experiences, and I think that you'll find that in a lot of cases, their experience is not that different from the experience of growing up with any other not non-normative sexual orientation.  Or romantic orientation, let's not forget that these are two separate things.  This last one is a little bit more difficult to talk about because I don't have a lot of personal experience with the history of the movement.  A lot of what I am learning about this recently, I am learning about it quite recently, and I'm learning it from people who are older in the community, who've been around for longer, and that is the question of whether or not kink has a place at Pride.  I know that may seem sort of like nonsensical because when we think of Pride, when I think of Pride at least, leather daddies are up there in the list of things I would expect to see and would imagine seeing when I'm at Pride.  The idea of gay men who are kinksters wearing their harnesses and all that stuff, wearing their puppy masks.  All of that is stuff that I kind of consider to be an inherent part of the package deal when you go to Pride.  Pride, to me, is a semi-sexual event, because part of it has to do with the ability to sexually express yourself in the way that is most comfortable for you.  But the discourse is essentially that overt displays of sexuality are inappropriate and may be triggering for people who don't have positive experiences with those things or who may feel as though they are being drawn into a, like, a voyeurism slash exhibitionism kink that they might not be, like, consenting to.  Or that some people have been abused in the context of kink in the past and so being exposed to the gear might be potentially triggering to their past experience and their trauma.  I don't know if it's possible to reconcile people needing a safe space from sex and pride, which to me is inherently an expression of sexuality and sexual freedom.  I'll see if I can find some of the Twitter threads that I've been reading to sort of help inform where I am at with this mentally.  I follow this gay kinkster on YouTube and on Twitter.  His name is Amp, I think, and he has this channel called What's the Safe Word?  He wrote a thread on Twitter about the presence of kink and leather daddies at Pride and what it means to his identity as a gay man.  to have that kink stuff be an expression of his sexuality and his kink and like this is part of his personality and who he is and his lifestyle.  I think for a lot of gay people and gay men in particular that the kink scene is a part of their sexuality in the same way that their gayness is part of their sexuality.  it's part of how they express who they are.  And Amp explained that him being in his harness in public is not him being inherently sexual in public, because the kink is part of his personality, and wearing the harness is a way of saying, hey, this is who I am as a person, it's not in that moment and in that context an explicit expression of sexualness.  Like, it's not the same as performing an exhibitionist sex act in the hopes that someone will come by because you have an exhibition kink, because what you're doing is wearing an article of clothing, not engaging in a sexual act.  I also saw this other twitter thread, which I do not know if I will be able to find, about there being a sort of generational difference with the older queer people being like kind of informed by a mentality of the freedom to do something, and this person described the younger generation as being formed more around the freedom from a thing, like freedom from oppression, basically, whereas the older generation had to do more fighting for the freedom to be expressive in this particular way.  So there would be sort of an obvious dichotomy there, where the older kinksters and queer people who've been part of the community for longer say, I have the freedom to express myself in this way, And particularly in this context, it's when I should feel the most free to express myself in this way.  Whereas you may have younger people coming into the community who are\u2014 I think it would be fair to say that this new, younger generation of queer people is a lot more in tune with the idea of people who don't want to have sex.  Like, I think the queer community has possibly in the past been about, like, oh, this is who we want to have sex with, this is who we want to love.  And then you have this more recent thing where asexual and aromantic people are becoming an increasing part of the conversation.  So you've got these younger people who are more aware of the fact that there are people who will be wanting to be away from sexuality, but who are also queer, and they're coming from this in a framework mindset of, I have the freedom from these things which are hurtful.  And that may be overly reductionist, and I am totally stealing that idea from someone else, but this is just trying to sort of understand where the conflict of interest comes in.  But I personally don't think that I can land on anything other than kinksters belong at Pride, and wearing a harness isn't an inherently sexual act.  It's almost, to me, like, do you think that a woman wearing a very deep, low-cut shirt to expose her cleavage is, by going out in public, forcing you to engage in voyeurism or her exhibitionism because her clothing is inherently sexualized?  I don't think that's the case.  I don't think you can say, oh, a person wearing something very revealing or something that I view as inherently sexual is forcing me to participate in a sexual activity that I didn't consent to.  I just don't think that that's a sensible way of viewing it, and I think that kinksters have been such a staple and like a fixture at Pride that I don't think it's-.  I don't think there's a way to tell kinksters like no you can't wear your harness at Pride or that like there shouldn't be a leather float.  I think a lot of these older queer people would say we are the ones who trailblazed this, we are the ones who have fought for the ability to be perceived as acceptable in society.  I think that all along, kinksters have been kinda thrown under the bus because there have been such desperate attempts by the general gay population to seem as harmless as possible.  So you'll have a gay couple appearing in a commercial to normalize a very nuclear, normal family kinda thing, whereas, like, the kinksters, the people who are still called freaks and all that kinda stuff, people who want to express their gender in non-normative ways, as another example, are still very much treated like, oh, those are weird people.  Those are abnormal.  We are normal.  We are just like you straight people.  We just want to have kids and buy a house and all that stuff.  Like, respectability politics is certainly a part of this.  And people in the kink scenes have been there the entire time, fighting against AIDS and fighting against just all of the same oppressions.  They are not separate from our community.  Kinksters are part of our community.  people who engage in kink and are otherwise not queer are suddenly queer.  I don't mean that, I am talking about queer people who are also kinksters and for whom those identities are very intertwined.  The only way I can think to rectify this is to have there be separate events that are less sexualized.  for the people who are bothered by the presence of i don't want to say sexual gear or anything like that because like to me again wearing the leather is not in and of itself inherently sexual.  it would you would have to be actually performing a sex act but people who are uncomfortable with the overt displays of sexuality.  so the answer to do kinksters belong at pride.  i would say they are part of the founding of pride and you cannot extricate them from pride without it essentially not being the same thing anymore and without blocking off a not insignificant portion of the community from participation.  That does not mean that I think that asexual people who have been traumatized by kink should just stay home, I just don't have a good solution.  off the top of my head i just don't think that you can say kinksters don't belong at pride.  i don't think that that's possible or or valuable or makes any sense.  i skipped pride this year but that doesn't mean that other people don't go and have fun and i hope that you did or do have fun whenever your local Pride parade is happening.  If you have any other thoughts about this, especially if you can help inform me, like give me extra information that I don't already have.  that has gotten me to this point where I've come to these conclusions about who belongs at Pride, please comment below and let me know what your perspective is.  I'm always open to readjusting how I think about these things.  That's gonna be all for me today, though.
