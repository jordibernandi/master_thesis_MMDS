            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to Breaking News from Jerusalem, Israel.  As our ministry continues to launch outreaches and Bible classes and Bible CDs all through Israel, Yad L'Achim, the anti-missionary organization, continues to persecute, continues to shake, because Jews and Arabs are being saved like never before.  We're living in prophetic times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  Another reason they're shaking is because we're entering into the feasts of the Lord.  We are just weeks away from Yom HaTorah, the Feast of Trumpets.  As every day in the synagogues, they're blowing the trumpet right now without really understanding the real meaning.  We pray as as they blow the trumpet, the shofar, the Holy Spirit will open their eyes to see that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  Yeshua is the feast.  A new article just released on the internet by Yad L'Achim, found at yadlachim.co.il.  As you can see here on the screen, we have the article in Hebrew and in English.  Headlines, over 1,000 attend a Yad Lachim conference in Jerusalem to see how they can deal with missionary activity.  The article goes on to say they don't have enough manpower to deal with it.  They're asking for more volunteers.  As believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we know why they don't have enough manpower.  Because greater is He in us than the one in the world.  No one can stop the gospel of Yeshua.  As you can see here in the picture, one of the main rabbis, Rabbi Hagri, is screaming and shouting, ''Wake  up!''.  he says.  They're stealing the souls of the Jews.  Why are they saying that?  Because there is a revival in Israel.  Because Jews are being saved.  Because the gospel is being preached.  And because they know that in the season of the Feast of the Lord, many will hear about Yeshua.  One of the head leaders, Rabbi Deutsch, went on to say, we must fight the missionaries.  Ephesians, chapter 6, verse 12.  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  We understand that this is spiritual warfare.  It's a direct attack against the gospel of Yeshua.  Satan is losing his mind.  He knows that his time is near.  Hidgalut, Revelation, chapter 12, verse 12.  What triggered this conference?  and many like it through the land of Israel, is the book that's being used, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah, the story of Yitzhak Aduri, the most venerated rabbi in the history of Israel, that left a note revealing the name of Yeshua, Jesus, as the Messiah.  That book has been hitting the streets of Israel, the marketplaces, the synagogues, the hotels.  and leading many Jews to the Word of God and to salvation.  Another event that's triggered these conferences in Israel right now is the Bible CDs that were blasting all through the pulse boxes in Israel, south to north, with the Messianic prophecies underlined and contact information.  We give all the glory to Yeshua the Messiah.  We're small people with a big God.  They encouraged the people to share the hotline of Yad L'Achim everywhere, 24 hours a day, reporting any missionary activity.  Luke, chapter 23, verse 34.  Jesus, Yeshua said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.  And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.  We forgive them.  We love them.  But we cannot love people over righteousness.  The gospel must be preached.  In addition to the conference, they posted articles all over Israel explaining how to deal with missionary activity, how to make sure they don't steal your soul.  It's important we stay Jews.  And they also put up a video for people that are deaf.  and can hear in the sign language.  They've exhalated to a new level of persecution.  Matai, Matthew, chapter 5, verse 10.  Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  Over the years... Yad L'Achim, the anti-missionary organization in Israel, founded to deprogram believers, has been persecuting us.  But now with these new campaigns, new conferences, new articles all through Israel, radio broadcasts, television broadcasts, they've exhalated to a new level because they know that the time is near.  They know that Jews are being saved.  They know that Jews are now reading the Word of God and the Bible is clear.  Romans chapter 10, verse 17.  So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  There is no revival without the word of God.  The gospel must be preached.  We don't just preach the gospel on the internet.  We preach the gospel face to face.  Recently we heard somebody say that we are not to go into the synagogues and preach the gospel because they pray the Amidah.  The Amidah is a prayer three times a day that they pray cursing Yeshua the Messiah.  But Jesus, Yeshua said to go into the synagogues and preach the truth.  Luke chapter 12 verse 11, when you are brought before the synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say.  When the Holy Spirit tells us to go into the synagogues and preach, we go into the synagogues and preach, and we don't worry how to defend ourselves, because the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword.  We will continue to go into the synagogues, in the malls, in the mosques, in the streets, in the houses, in the rooftops, and proclaim the mighty gospel of Yeshua the Messiah.  Until all Israel shall be saved.  Romans 11.26 We will not be intimidated by Yad L'Achim or anyone.  As we enter into the season of the Feast of the Lord, we are going to increase our outreaches and our discipleship trainings.  Romans 1.16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  Please continue to stand and pray with us and for us as we continue the battle here on Ground Zero.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zeph Porat, reporting live from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
