            "text": "Mr.  Barrett, I have a number of questions relating to the actual functioning of the office, from law enforcement to the anti-crime agenda to the drug strategy to health care fraud, cooperation in the intelligence community and others, all of which I will get to.  But as you know from our first meeting, I have a fairly... I won't say fairly.  I have a very strong view relating to the matter to which you spoke last, and that is the hiring of undocumented workers by you and your husband.  When we first met on January the 5th, following your being named by President-elect Clinton to be Attorney General, you volunteered this fact to me.  You volunteered the circumstances under which this hiring took place, and you volunteered that what did take place was a violation of the United States immigration law.  I've spoken to you at length about this matter, and you've been interviewed by the FBI and by the committee investigative staff under oath.  And this matter is, as you know, a serious one in my view.  The committee and the public, as we've discussed, has to be assured that you are, without exception, going to be willing to enforce the law.  And the immigration law falls under your responsibility.  It happens on your watch as Attorney General.  And I believe it's important you have an opportunity to explain in even greater detail than you have in your opening statement the various circumstances surrounding this hiring.  Now, let me begin my questioning, if I may, on this matter, and then when my second round is up, we'll get back to those matters that have not been touched upon, and I expect everything will have been, related to the substantive operation of the department.  When did you first hire the unauthorized workers? ",
