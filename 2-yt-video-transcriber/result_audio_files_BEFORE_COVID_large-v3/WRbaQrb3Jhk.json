You're in no position to lecture the public about anything.  You know nothing about the real world.  Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.  So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and fuck off.  Okay?  Oh, the swear was beeped out by NBC.  He was also beat for his use of profanity in two other jokes.  One where he called Katz, James Corden, a fat pussy.  And another where he discussed the same films Judy Dench licking her ass.  Ew.  Wow.  The comedian, however, also peppered the monologue with references to Me Too and contemporary issues.  He started off by noting it was his fifth time hosting, and therefore he didn't care what flack he would take.  Then he punched in with a nod to last year's college admission scandal.  I came here in a limo tonight, and the license plate was made by Felicity Huffman.  Good for him.  He's a real comic. ",
