            "text": "what is up guys?  uh i got a a little bit of an interesting uh conversation point today.  um i i've found recently that the u.s birth rate is on a decline and i kind of found that very interesting.  that uh you know kids aren't having babies right.  i mean that's a pretty standard part of life is people get together especially like usually in their 20s there maybe early 30s.  uh start a family have some kids and we are just seeing a constant decrease every single year on births in the united states.  so i thought maybe i would share what i consider to be my five reasons for why i feel the birth rates are on a decline as usual.  no specific order here.  i just wrote them all down on cards and we're going to go over them one by one.  my number one relationships are gone gone.  we do not teach kids these days anything about relationships.  uh sex is just handed away as a bartering tool in order to get some attention right.  so chicks don't have any value in themselves anymore and it's becoming just getting laid.  and that's it.  uh and the thing that i i so yesterday i'm driving with my my two daughters and my niece and i'm listening to the radio i had on like the local pop station and this song comes on and it's um ariana grande.  thank you next and i'm listening to the lyrics and the lyrics are basically talking about all the dudes that she's burned through already this young girl right all the guys that she's burned through uh and a lot of them one of them being mac miller.  Rest in peace.  Great, great rapper.  Great guy from my local town of Pittsburgh.  Um, which she ruined.  I mean, she, she ruined that kid and left him depressed and lost.  And she went with that Pete Davidson guy from the Saturday night live who looks like a couple.  Look, I've been around enough dope nod people in my life.  He's got the dope face.  Okay.  Guys on something.  But this song basically talks about.  the concept of the song is thank you next.  That's all she keeps saying.  Thank you next.  I'm so grateful for my ex.  Thank you next.  So just saying, hey, thanks for the time.  But next, next, next.  It's no big deal to just burn through people.  So the whole idea of a relationship is nothing.  I mean, I think the average relationship now for these kids is like maybe a year, maybe two years tops.  And then they're just done and they're moving on to the next one.  A lot of them, they're going months, you know, eight, nine months, boom, another relationship, another relationship.  And they go from one to the next, like it's nothing.  It doesn't even phase them anymore.  So number one, relationships are gone.  And like I said, I blame a lot of it on all the stuff that these kids are seeing and all of the experiences that they've had in their lives so far.  Number two, the culture.  These young people right now that should be repopulating this planet have watched their parents all go through divorces.  I mean, there's a large majority of parents right now that are divorced and they're doing these split up goofy households.  And these kids are seeing that and they don't want nothing to do with that.  They're being raised in it.  They're being raised in single parent homes.  They're seeing the struggles that come out of it.  They're seeing the failed relationships of their parents.  They don't want that same thing to happen, and can you blame them?  I sure can't.  I mean, I get it.  If you don't want to be a part of that world, I get it.  That's kind of where I'm at right now, even though I'm finding out a lot older in life.  I see what's going on.  We're raising this world of nothingness, you know, of no \u2013 You don't put in that try anymore, that hard work to try to make it work.  People lost that.  They expected it to be easy the whole time, and it's just not.  Like I said, they're watching their parents do it, and they're watching their dads go through women, and they're watching their moms go through men, and getting divorced and thinking it's going to be so green on the other side, and it ends up being a complete mess.  So the culture is really screwing with these kids' heads.  my third reasoning the debt right.  these young people coming out of school right now are in so much debt that they couldn't possibly consider a family.  you know and here's the hard thing is I got a buddy that's going to school to be a pharmacist right and he's I mean over $200,000 in debt and he's finally finishing everything up.  But like he said, he goes, but I'm going to work for the next 10 to 15 years.  I'm going to make six figures a year, but the amount of money I'm going to pay back on my student loans, it's going to be like, I'm working a normal $45,000 a year job for like 10 years because I got to put so much money back into these loans or he's got to pay on it for the rest of his life, which you don't want to do that either.  And then the hard thing too is women hold 60% of the student loan debt.  It's like two thirds right now.  Two thirds of all student loan debt is held by women.  Now you gotta think of it this way.  What are they gonna wanna do, right?  So they all think that going to school is the answer.  They're gonna get this phenomenal job and all that, right?  But then they realize they want that relationship.  They wanna have that family.  I mean, it's in their DNA.  It is in a woman's DNA to want to have children.  It's part of the deal, right?  So now, how are you supposed to have kids?  If she has $150,000 in student loan debt and the guy has $150,000 in student loan debt and they're both barely paying it off while working, she can't have a kid and miss months of work.  And I mean, nowadays, companies barely even give me any type of time off to even have a kid.  So what are you supposed to do?  Where are they supposed to have this kid at whenever they're up to their noses in debt?  And this kind of goes part and part with.  my number four is, the lifestyles that they choose right now, right?  A lot of my younger people that I know in my life that are in their upper 20s, lower 30s, their lifestyles are insane.  They're all driving Mercedes and BMW SUVs, and they're always decked out.  Even if they get a non-luxury brand car, it's a decked out, fully loaded one, and they're paying top dollar for it.  They're all buying $350,000 houses in these gigantic neighborhoods with all these people.  I don't get that.  I don't get why you would wanna put yourself into so much debt right away.  But I guess part of it is they've been sold this pipe dream, right, that they're gonna go to school, they're gonna get this degree, they're gonna come out and make a bunch of money.  They put in all the work, they put in all the time, and now here they are, they just wanna enjoy their lives.  So yeah, even though they're stricken with handcuffs of student loans, I feel like they are okay with just spending their extra money.  They're not thinking wisely.  Very few people graduate and live frugally and pay off all their student loans and get it all out of the way and done.  Most people start living bad right away and living broke on another level is what I always say.  So instead of being broke down here, now they're broke up here.  They're making more money.  They got that better job, but they're still broke.  But they got a Mercedes and a $350,000 house, but they still live paycheck to paycheck.  Um, they don't even want kids, you know, their lifestyle.  They like to travel.  They like to run around.  They like to do all this stuff that they didn't get to do because they were, you know, raised in a single mother household and they were always broken.  They never got to go anywhere.  So, uh, they're, they're living this, this life of just, I mean, every month.  their bills are so expensive.  Look at the Mercedes.  You want to go, even if you want to go lease a decent little Mercedes SUV, you're going to be paying six, 700 bucks a month for it.  Who wants to pay that much money for a car?  Um, That's just bad, bad.  And you got a hundred thousand plus dollars in student loan debt each.  And you're supposed to think about having kids.  Clearly it's not going to happen.  And my number five is why we're all here and why we're watching my channel and why I'm doing.  what I'm doing is I think a lot of guys are finding out the MGTOW lifestyle.  They are seeing that there is not a lot of value in starting a family and starting a relationship.  And these women are just burning through them, right?  That's the only good thing right now.  is guys are learning even earlier that women are just burning and burning and burning.  They're always never happy.  They always think that something's going to be better on the other side.  And they're always jumping ship on them.  So after a while, you get to a point where you don't want to try that anymore, right?  It's what's Albert Einstein say, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.  I mean, you keep trying and trying and trying and you're not getting anywhere with it.  Eventually you just go, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Maybe it's not them.  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I'm the one who's just trying too hard here and I shouldn't be putting in all this effort with so little of a return on my investment, right?  So I think a lot of guys are finding that living their own life and doing their own thing is more important to them than trying to start a family, right?  I mean, if you're any bit of a financially sound or smart person, you're gonna realize that it's just not, it's gonna cost you way too much money and the gamble is just gigantic.  You know, you wanna build yourself a little empire and start your own business or move up in the corporate world and make more money, you have to constantly be worried that at any moment, that can all be taken away from you, right?  That house that you paid for, those cars, all that stuff that you're paying for can easily go away and all she has to do is just say, I'm not happy anymore.  I'm just gonna leave.  So I get it.  You know, those are my top five of why I think that people aren't having kids anymore.  But I get it right now.  You know, bringing kids into this world, the way that people are living.  It's got to be a little bit scary.  I mean, I'm the father of two teenage girls.  You guys know that.  And I worry for my kids.  And I think all the time about what are they going to experience and what's their dating life's going to be like.  And I'm going to try to teach them the old school ways of living.  And hopefully they'll be able to find that traditional style relationship where they can learn to be happy.  But unfortunately, as long as they keep watching social media as much as most people do, especially women, it's probably going to be a hard one.  It's probably going to be a hard one to make sure that they stay out of the crap.  Guys, I appreciate everything.  Again, thanks for watching.  Subscribe if you're new here.  Give my videos a like.
