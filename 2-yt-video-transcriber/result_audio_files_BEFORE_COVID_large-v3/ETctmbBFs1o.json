            "text": "I want to, I've titled this, Why I was on my phone for a reason.  Every Thursday from about six o'clock to seven o'clock at our prayer center here in Cleveland, we have about 50, a minimum of 50, 80, 100, sometimes 150 people who show up for what we call live prayer.  The prayer that we pray, in fact, the entire service is unedited and uncut as it happens, is... presented to the people who are present and over the internet.  Now what we do is we have people from around the world who are sending in a prayer request over their computer and we print those out.  So we usually have a stack of requests this big and our people individually take those and pray for them.  Now, we are not set up at this point.  We're building a prayer center, but we're not set up but with one camera where a 12-year-old kid, bless his heart, just stays there and he just basically stays on me the whole time.  He doesn't show the people.  He doesn't turn it around.  He just kind of stays there because he's not trained to, you know, walk around while people are praying or show the request or show the room.  And so I'm at a table and directly behind me are, you know, sometimes as I said, 50 to 150 people and they're just walking around and just praying and you don't hear most of them.  the microphone I stay on a microphone and I pray for people.  I pray for requests I lead it up and being a full gospel minister we believe in the baptism in the Holy Spirit speaking the tongues I do know from people who have shared it with me including people of the Muslim background in Israel.  my Muslim driver heard me pray in tongues and in three or four different languages and could tell me everything I said.  And his name was Joseph.  My driver, Mike, who drives for me in Israel, has heard me pray in the Holy Spirit.  My guide, Gideon, is Jewish, has heard me pray in the Holy Spirit.  And he even heard me one time praying a Samaritan dialect that 600 people in the West Bank, the Samaritans, speak.  So this gift is very real.  And a lot of people maybe don't understand it, and there are nominal people from mainline churches that actually don't believe the gift is real, although they say it was real in the Bible time, but it's not today, which I can't figure that out, if the Holy Spirit is the same today as he was in the time of the Bible.  The other day in prayer, and the reason I'm sharing this with you, there is a big-time comedian that got a hold of a video clip, a Baptist pastor, African-American guy got a hold of a video clip, and somebody else, and it went viral, where I am looking at my phone, I have a microphone, I'm praying in the Spirit, and I'm and I'm looking at my phone, and they see me doing this, and so they've made a big joke out of this.  In fact, some of them made a horrible joke out of it, and they've even mocked speaking in tongues, which I regret that because you can't blaspheme the Holy Spirit and get forgiveness if you blaspheme, and I'm not saying they did.  I think some of them are doing it ignorantly.  So one of the African American guys who has a big following come on and just blasted me.  Why is he looking at his phone?  You shouldn't pray in tongues.  Okay, now here's what I have taught people for years.  Watch your perception because what you perceive may not be the fact.  Number two, know all the information before you post something.  Every one of these people that have posted this have one clip that a very anti-Holy Spirit Baptist pastor, that's who he was, got a hold of and made a big mockery out of me because I was looking at my phone.  what they did not know.  This is what all the people that have given hateful comments and all the people that have blasted me, this is what you didn't know.  This is why you don't just say something without facts.  You don't just post something without information.  Do you know why I was looking at my phone and praying?  Because there is a pastor friend of mine from Ohio whose wife has cancer.  And that pastor had called me earlier the day crying and saying, tonight at prayer, would you call me with my wife and put her on speaker on your phone and pray for this cancer that she has?  that God will help her.  And I'm picking up my phone because it's getting a quarter to seven.  And I'm picking up my phone to text him while I'm praying.  I didn't quit praying.  I laid my phone down.  And I'm praying in the spirit.  And I'm travailing because this woman has been very sick.  And I'm texting the pastor.  We are now praying.  Can you get her on the phone?  Is she ready?  He's texting me back.  We're going to go to the room right now.  And I'm on my phone.  to text a pastor whose wife has cancer who's one of my closest friends in the world that i preached for ever since i was 18 years of age.  and so the critics skeptics and comedians saw me praying in the holy spirit travailing groaning holding my phone and mocked me for being on my phone made all kinds of jokes and you know and the preachers most of them who didn't even believe in speaking in tongues at all by the way Just blasting me.  Okay, so you made fun of me for making a call to a pastor whose wife had cancer who wanted prayer.  That's what you were mocking.  To you, your perception was me praying in tongues looking at my phone and they made all kinds of jokes of who I was talking to and what the texts were about.  And it's to a pastor whose wife has cancer.  You know, it reminds me of a woman years ago that my wife was on the Manifest telecast.  I said, baby, you got it.  It's Christmas.  It's the holiday season.  Why don't you do a program with me in advance?  And she said, I just don't feel like it.  I said, please, please come and do it.  And my wife was on a telecast and she wasn't very spunky.  She wasn't real joyful.  She did the telecast by absolute faith.  And a woman... emailed us after the program aired and said, you need to tell your wife if she's going to be on TV, she needs to be a little bit happier because it was obvious she didn't want to be there.  And she just blasted my wife.  Here's what she didn't know.  She did not know that my wife had had a miscarriage and we lost a baby and she was very sad.  And she came out on that television program by utter faith only because I asked her.  And I wrote that woman, and I'm honest, I'm blasting her.  What do you mean?  judging someone by appearance?  And the Bible says we should not judge by appearance.  Why are you judging someone by appearance when you don't even know what they've been through?  I remember years ago, a woman that I love dearly was known for wearing wigs of a certain color.  And I remember people making fun of her.  Why is she wearing that stupid looking wig?  That's the dumbest looking thing.  And her sister told me several years ago, she said, you know, the reason my sister wore those wigs, she liked that tint in it, that particular tint, that particular color, but she inherited a gene from my father, she had lost her hair.  So she didn't have much hair to make up with and that's why she wore the wigs.  I hope that whether you're the comedian, I hope maybe somebody that's connected to this comedian will get him the message.  It's not going to change what he did.  He's not going to apologize.  I know that.  I hope those ministers will hear me and say, instead of taking a clip that one guy took, took one clip, made a big page of it on a website, basically just to get money and just to get followers.  mocking the Holy Spirit and mocking me for having the phone, not knowing somebody had cancer at a prayer meeting.  And also there's requests that come in.  I look at my phone while I'm praying because someone will say, Perry, I need you to pray for my child.  These are friends.  They just fell in a football game and had broke their knee.  And I read those texts because they know I'm praying.  They know that we're live prayer.  That's why the phone is there.  So I wanted to give an explanation because there's a lot of people that have made very negative comments, but they're making negative comments based on a lack of information.  And I felt it necessary to come on here and share with you because a lot of you have seen it.  A lot of you have had to defend me.  You didn't have to defend me, but you defended me because you know my ministry and you know me.  But I felt like I just needed to come and speak out.  So the next time before you... do a clip, a clip, not the whole thing but a clip, and post something and give your opinion of it, it might be good to check out the entire facts because there are people that can do this and if they slander someone by doing it and by making a clip and it becoming slanders, they're liable to a lawsuit.  And I'm not saying I'm suing anybody for this.  I'm not planning on doing that.  But I am saying you better be careful because you might get a hold of someone one day that would do that because you've made a perception and a judgment that's incorrect.  Thank you for your time.  And I hope that this has helped some of you that maybe had a question.  And you're gonna see me with that phone anytime.  I pray until we build our new prayer center where everything will come on the screen because I'm going to make sure that if there's anybody sending me a request, it gets prayed for between six to seven o'clock.  So you join me, live prayer, at Omega Center International, 6 o'clock to 7, over the internet, and you can send your request in.  We've gotten praise reports of a 10-year-old girl that got touched.  The mother said she was healed of cancer.  We've gotten all kinds of testimonies of the people praying and the prayers being answered.  So again, if you know the person that sent these videos out and you want to copy this and send it to them, I wish that a lot of you that follow us, if people have asked you the question, you'll just send them right to our YouTube channel right now and let them see this particular video.  Thank you for your time.  God bless you. ",
