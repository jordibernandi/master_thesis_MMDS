Ten little fingers that won't hold your hand.  Ten little toes that'll never touch sand.  Two little layers I won't hear you say.  Your voice is so sweet to me.  Don't tell me that love wins when this is how it ends for me.  Devil laughed and the angels cried when I first got my wings up.  Did I have no right to laugh cause you didn't hear me cry and I wish you only knew that I was made to love you.  I hope someday when you form life again that you'll just strengthen the strong woman the kind that's brave and raises her babies.  don't take from them what you stole from them.  Don't tell me that love wins when this is how it ends for me.  Devil laughed and the angels cried when I first got my wings.  Oh, did I have no right to laugh cause you didn't hear me cry.  And I wish you only knew that I was made to love you.  i was made. ",
