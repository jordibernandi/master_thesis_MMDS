That was then.  Today, though, Buttigieg is not just running against Bernie for the Democratic presidential nomination.  He's putting out ridiculous press releases suggesting Sanders could alienate independents.  All right, fine.  It's not fair to accuse him of flip-flopping on Bernie, given it was nearly 20 years ago and he was just an 18-year-old high school student at the time.  But health care, immigration, special interests, political reform, he's flip-flopped for the worse on all of them in the past 12 months alone.  Don't get me wrong, Buttigieg would be a far better and a far more progressive presidential candidate than John Kerry ever was.  In fact, even now, post flip-flops, his policy platform is to the left of Barack Obama's in 2008.  But if you're looking for consistency, whether moral or political, if you're looking for a candidate who has very clear principles and sticks to them, no matter what a focus group or a big donor says to him, then maybe, just maybe, Mayor Pete isn't your guy.
