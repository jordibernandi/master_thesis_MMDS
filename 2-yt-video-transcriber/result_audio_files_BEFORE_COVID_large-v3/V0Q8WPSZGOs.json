            "text": "Hello, family.  I just wanted to do a quick video to give my testimony on how I woke up to the knowledge that we were the true biblical Hebrews.  It'll be a short video.  It's my first one, so bear with me.  Okay.  I woke up in 2015 in December, which is a couple months after the last blood moon.  So at that time I had been mindful, because of all the Blood Moon activity and I was a Christian, that something was definitely about to happen.  I didn't know what it was, but I had begun to pray in earnest just to make sure that my spirit and my heart was right with the Most High, who I called God at the time.  So on one of those occasions, I was in the bathroom having my prayer time, And at the end of my prayer time, I just wanted to make sure I had one base, that last base covered.  I wanted to pray for the peace of His people.  Israel were the people over in the land today that I thought were Israel.  Just as the verse says in Genesis 12, verse 3, pray for the peace of Israel, those who Bless you will be blessed.  Those who curse you will be cursed.  So it took me a long time to even learn to love the people over there.  You know, I had my own issues about that throughout the years, but I had overcome that.  And so I was praying for them earnestly, you know, that they would be safe.  At the end of that particular part of the prayer, the end of the prayer, a thought popped into my head out of nowhere.  And it was, I wonder what tribe Benjamin Netanyahu, their prime minister, is from.  And that was a strange thought to have.  I always knew it was important to know who all of the sons were of Jacob.  Lots of things in the Old Testament I knew were important or the Most High would not have put it in there.  But that thought was weird to me.  But I wouldn't let it go.  So as soon as I got up off my knees, I said, I'll just go to the computer and look it up.  I looked it up.  It took just maybe five or ten minutes.  I did not find that he was from any tribe, let alone the tribe of Judah.  What I did discover was that his grandfather had changed the family name from, I believe it was, Milakowski to Netanyahu.  And that they were originally from Poland.  or the Russian area over there.  And I started reading a little bit more about it, and I thought, my goodness, he has no connection at all with the land.  So when I got up, I started walking around the room, and I said, Lord, out loud, Lord, who are these people?  And then I started doing more research that very day.  I started going onto YouTube, And it didn't take long to find out that those who went into captivity, our ancestors, my particular ancestors also, those who were scattered to the four corners of the earth, were the true biblical Hebrews.  And it was startling.  It was almost impossible to believe, as those of you who have awakened have experienced that thought.  I did my research.  I found everything under the sun, the good, the bad, the ugly, the true, the not true, crazy people, false teachers, correct teachers.  But at the time in 2015, when the majority of us were waking up, there was not a lot out there on the internet for me to really grasp on.  So within these two years, I have learned an awful lot.  I try every spirit, every teaching.  I don't believe everything I hear.  I pray over it first.  I have three adult daughters who I was able to correct the teachings that I had taught them when they were young, that we were from Ham.  And I was very grateful to be able to go to them and to correct that error.  So I'm very grateful to the Most High for waking me up in the way that he did.  You know, we all wake up differently.  It's unique to each of us.  But the way that he woke me up was special to me and very unique and could create a lot of enemies when I mentioned the Prime Minister's name like that, but it was all true.  I just wanted to share that with you so that you would all know.  I've only seen a few videos out there of testimonies on how we all woke up.  I wish more of you would put them out there.  They're really inspiring to watch, and they don't last but a few minutes.  So if you get it laid on your heart from the Most High to share your story, it means a lot to other people.  And that's the only reason I got on here.  I thought maybe this could help somebody who just woke up or inspired them.  You know, a lot of people get waken up by family members.  It doesn't matter how you wake up.  I just knew that mine was a little bit different.  And I wanted to share it with all of you.  So I ask that the Most High, our Father, bless each and every one of you and keep you all safe in the times to come.  I know our captivity is just about over.  So study, pray.  Do your research.  And that's all I have to share with you right now.  I wear glasses, so if you think my eyes are weird, I took them off.  So bless you all.  Goodbye for now. ",
