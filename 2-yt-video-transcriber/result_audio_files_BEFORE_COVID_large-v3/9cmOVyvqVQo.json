            "text": "This time of the year, going into the holidays, it's kind of a time when we think a lot about what it was like two years ago now.  I think it was the first time that I realized that something wasn't right.  I had been to the doctor and had gotten some blood work done and he thought that I should see a specialist.  But at the same time, I thought that the reason I was having some blood work that didn't seem quite right was because it was associated with a tooth problem I had and I had taken a lot of aspirin and that had caused my platelet count to drop down.  But that year our children came home for Christmas with their children and I think during the holidays, during Thanksgiving and Christmas, began to realize that something was wrong.  And I was just so tired.  Usually I just enjoy so much.  I stay up late with the kids and I was going to bed early and just feeling pretty bad.  So after Christmas, we had decided, we had talked and I said, I think I am going to go back to the doctor.  And before I could get that appointment and get back, one night I started throwing up blood.  So after we got to the ER and they ran some tests, we were shocked to find out that I had end-stage liver disease, cirrhosis.  And I was scheduled to have a scope done the next morning.  I spent the night in the ER.  And when they took me back for the scope to see where the bleeding was coming from, there was too much blood for them to do the procedure.  So I ended up in the intensive care with a breathing tube until they could wait a while and try again.  Eventually what happened was I was continuing to see a doctor.  They were continuing to run tests.  They could not understand.  I had no hepatitis.  I had no reason for the cause of the cirrhosis, but I kept getting worse and my counts kept getting worse.  And it wasn't very long after my second trip to the ER when they were shocked at how much worse, again, my liver had gotten.  And my doctor was saying, you're heading for a liver transplant.  And I was just shocked.  You know, I really, I just kept thinking this can't be right.  They have to have made a mistake.  Eventually, after having a liver biopsy, I was able to get an appointment in with the liver doctors, the transplant center.  And they felt that I had a genetic condition called congenital hepatic fibrosis.  It was, you know, it was a lot to take in.  I can remember at one point when they had just told me I was going to have to have a transplant, I was just so upset.  I mean, I just couldn't, you know, I just didn't want my mind to go there.  And, you know, I found I had to like kind of fight fear all the time because I didn't want to, I didn't want fear to cripple me in my fight against it.  So I remember one time Pastor Carol told me we were actually having one of the conferences at church.  And, you know, I had told her, I said, well, you know, now they're saying I need a transplant.  And I just remember her saying, but God.  And just those two words, you know, got my mind kind of straightened around.  And I kind of focused on that.  I had gotten strep bovis, which is common with liver patients.  The liver helps protect infection from going all through your body.  And so when I got this, within about 24 hours, I had passed out.

That night when we came home, I was so glad to be back in my own bed and just, you know, trying to settle in.  That night, I spiked a fever, and I just didn't want to go back, but I knew I had to because I knew what had happened before with infections.  So we went to the ER, and this time we went to UC since I was with the transplant team.  Well, I ended up being in the hospital nine days that time.  And at that point, Pastor Tim and Carol came to visit one night.  Dave was there, and they suggested that we take communion. ",

            "text": "And we did.  Together.  We did that after they left that night.  It was really just shortly after that.  That was during the month of June.  When I had sepsis, we had our last grandbaby born.  And honestly, I didn't know if I'd ever get to see her.  During the time when I was still really sick and Pastor Tim had taught on the difference between a rhema and a logos word of God.  And that morning I remember asking God, you know, I need a rhema word from you to get through this.  So what is my rhema word?  And I thought that he was going to tell me the healing scriptures, which I had read over and over.  But first he said, and I thought he said, peace, be still and know that I'm God.  But I think the scripture, when I looked it up at Psalm 4610, it says, be still and know that I am God.  But if you go back to verse one of that Psalm, it says, God is our refuge and strength and ever present help in trouble.  And I felt like that, you know, I... Understood the peace.  that passes all understanding because we had bad news and bad news and bad news.  It just kept getting worse and worse.  We had appointments at the transplant center that we were required to go to for classes and we had one.  A particular morning in July.  So I had gotten up early and gotten my shower.  And when I was in my shower, you know, I had been so weak that most of the time I sat here on the couch when I was sick.  Dave would have to do all the grocery shopping, all the outdoor work.  all the laundry, all the cleaning, cooking.  I mean, I literally could hardly get a shower, and I'd have to lay down before I could get dressed.  I was so weak.  But that morning, I got up and took my shower, and I remember thinking in the shower, I feel pretty good today.  You know, it was like such a change.  I remember when I pulled the shower curtain back and I saw the mirror, the vanity mirror, that my skin had some color in it again.  And Dave came upstairs and I'm like, Dave, look at me.  Do you think I look better?  And And he said, you can't go down there looking that good or they're not going to give you a liver.  And each day I just felt stronger and stronger.  And, you know, I had been getting occupational therapy, physical therapy.  I could hardly do anything when they first started coming.  So anyhow, I was anxious, you know, to get a follow up with the doctors and my blood work started coming back.  good i had two more scans of my um.  the scopes for my varices came back.  fine i didn't have any and i had probably had four or five before that and they were all a minimum of three.  when we went back to the doctor and i told him i'm healed you know.

The other scripture that I felt was my rainbow word that I heard God give me was where he said, I will withhold no good thing from you.  So when I looked that up, that's Psalm 84.1.  In the Message Bible, it says, All sunshine and sovereign is God, generous in gifts and glory.  and he doesn't scrimp with his traveling companions.  And that really touched me because I did feel like, you know, I went through a journey, but he was always with me.  That same psalm, it says, Oh, Lord Almighty, blessed is the man who trusts in you.  It's smooth sailing all the way with God of the angel armies.  And I love that since Pastor Tim has been teaching us about the angel armies. ",
