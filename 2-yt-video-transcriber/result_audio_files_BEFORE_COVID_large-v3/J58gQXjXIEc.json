My name is Jared Taylor, and I'm the founder of American Renaissance, which is primarily a website, but it's also a YouTube channel, and we do podcasts.  We used to put out a monthly publication, started that in 1990, so I've been doing this for 28 years.  In 2010, we went all to the web, and that way we can reach far more people.  And as I described myself in the movie here, I am a race realist and a white advocate.  Now, what do those two words mean?  A race realist is someone that recognizes that race is a biological phenomenon.  I don't think it's some sort of sociological optical illusion.  People of different races have evolved in different environments and that has produced the different physical differences that are very clearly visible.  And the idea that somehow when you see a black person or an Eskimo or an Asian person and you are seeing some kind of social construct rather than biology, I think that idea is just so obviously wrong and stupid that only very smart people could persuade themselves that it's true.  It's just a goofy idea.  Race is a biological phenomenon.  And I think that race is an important part of individual and group identity.  It's not some sort of little airy-fairy thing that we can overcome if we just set our minds to it.  Race, I think, is too deeply imprinted in us for us to say we're going to live in a post-racial society.  I think that may never come.  Race is too important for that.  Now, what is white advocacy?  White advocacy is a recognition that whites, just like every other racial group, have legitimate group interests.  Black people have organizations that push their interests.  So do Asians.  So do Hispanics.  But if a white person says, look, we have an interest in doing X, Y, or Z, that is considered white supremacy.  That's neo-Nazism.  So that you can have a black professional association of psychologists, of police officers, of firefighters.  If whites did that, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't you dare do that.  Now, in the movie, I was also quoted as saying that I think the word white supremacy, that should be retired.  Because what is a white supremacist?  I believe that word applies only to white people who wish to rule over and dominate people of other races.  Certainly, historically, that has been a phenomenon, the idea of taking a certain race of people and making only them slaves.  That's certainly white supremacy.  Whites going to Africa and saying, we are going to run this place, or going to India and saying, we are going to run this place.  That's white supremacy.  That is domination of people of other races by whites.  The idea that I have is that I believe the primary legitimate interest of whites is to survive as a distinct people with a distinct culture.  Now there was quite a round of applause in this room among you people when I predicted that if in 200 years... ",
