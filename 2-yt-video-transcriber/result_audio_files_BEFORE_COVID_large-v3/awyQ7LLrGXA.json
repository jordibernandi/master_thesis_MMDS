            "text": "Something that might surprise you is that while I focus a lot on this channel on the dangers of propaganda, I don't view propaganda as inherently bad.  It's easy to have that view today when nearly all of propaganda produced is pure evil and aimed at destroying everything you love, but just like anything else, it's a tool that can be used properly or it can be abused.  We often talk about how at least 80% of the population is made up of NPCs just blindly reacting to stimuli, never thinking for themselves.  They're told how to think and their software is updated for lack of a better term, by the talking heads on TV and on the internet, and they go about their business regurgitating talking points and doing whatever they're told because, as I've covered in other videos, it's part of a survival strategy to get along with the group.  Going against the grain is impossible for them because it literally endangers their ability to survive.  They can't survive on their own, so they have to make sure they're in line with the group.  This is never going to change.  Which is exactly why propaganda is necessary.  That's right, it's necessary.  You might be able to get the number of sentient people a little bit higher with education and cultural reforms, but the vast majority of people are always going to be NPCs.  No matter what kind of society you have, the libertarian idea that we're all... free-thinking individuals, you know, kings of our own dominion, completely separate from the herd, applies only to a very small portion of the population.  Which is why, by the way, only a very small portion of the population are libertarians.  And that portion is vastly outnumbered by the people who generally act as a group.  They comply with the herd.  So if you want to prevent these groups, these herds from spinning out of control and going over the ledge and taking you with them, propaganda is one of the tools that has to be used.  And the right has been modestly successful with propaganda in the last few years.  Not because they're talented manipulators.  In fact, compared to leftist memes like big-budget Hollywood films, it's amateur hour.  But the reason right-wing memes, which are a form of propaganda, seem to be having such an impact on the culture is they're often telling the truth.  They line up with reality.  The left has been using their propaganda to push the NPCs as far away from reality as they possibly can for centuries.  And it's been insanely successful.  But even NPCs have eyes and ears.  And even if it doesn't seem like it most of the time, they do live on the same planet and in the same reality as you do.  The more personal experience that they have in the real world, the more they will obtain a sense of truth.  Even if it's hidden under layers and layers of leftist talking points, it's still there.  And so the more they're going to respond, or at least maybe have the ability and the desire to respond to truth.  The left knows this, which is exactly why they're trying as desperately as they can to prevent NPCs from having contact with the real world.  They want them drugged up, watching their propaganda living vicariously through the characters on their screens or the sports players on their screens and interacting with other NPCs in virtual worlds that they have created for the NPCs.  They want to keep the slaves in their cells and only opening the door if it's to retrieve a package of new virtual worlds left on their doorsteps by the Amazon Prime delivery man, who by the way, because he's going out into the real world too, he must be replaced by robots so they can keep him in his cell, which will happen very soon, by the way.  Now that said, there are still a large number of NPCs that have plenty of exposure to real life, so propaganda that promotes truth is going to be more compatible.  They're going to be more receptive to that than propaganda that promotes insanity.  Positive, honest propaganda meant to guide them in the right direction is going to resonate with them because, as E. Michael Jones might say, it's logos.  So with this in mind, I'd like to take a look at a film that was produced for propaganda purposes, but not with the intent to subvert or to destroy the culture and the nation.  Propaganda that doesn't attempt to disguise itself as something it's not with a distracting storyline or half-naked women or explosions.  Propaganda the left would dismiss as antiquated and hateful.  Propaganda, like the 1961 film Boys Beware.  Boys Beware was one of the many propaganda films produced by director and close friend of John Wayne's, Sidney Davis.  John Wayne bankrolled the first film made by Davis called Dangerous Stranger, which was a propaganda film warning children, mostly young girls, of the dangers of being kidnapped by strangers.  The film was shown in schools and by police departments all around the country and led to several other films such as VD, The Dropout, Girls Beware, and Keep Off the Grass.  And before you laugh and snicker at these films, ask yourself if that attitude towards these films was programmed into you.  by bigger budget, more subversive and artful leftist propaganda produced in Hollywood?  Are they really dangerous scare tactic films?  Or were they useful tools designed to guide society away from real-life dangers?  Were they logos?  Boys Beware opens up with an honest, straightforward disclosure that it was produced with the help of the Englewood Police Department and school district.  How many Hollywood films tell you who's behind their messaging?  The film then begins with Lieutenant Williams of the Englewood Police Department narrating and telling the audience that he's on his way to go speak at a high school.  We immediately see how much the trust in society has been eroded when he passes by young boys hitchhiking at the side of the road, something that has become way too dangerous to do in today's society.  Dangers that were only just beginning.  to rear their ugly head in 1961 when this film was made.  Lieutenant Williams begins to tell the tale of Jimmy Barnes, a boy who decided to hitch a ride home.  He's picked up by a man who seems nice enough, but as we'll learn, this man is grooming him.  The film accurately depicts the tactics of a predator.  He's identified Jimmy as someone who's enough of a loner and in need of companionship that he's easily manipulated into spending time with the predator.  As the predator, all the while lavishing Jimmy with gifts and praise, slowly introduces and escalates sexual behavior.  First, it's jokes. ",

What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick.  A sickness that was not visible like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious.  a sickness of the mind.  You see, Ralph was a homosexual, a person who demands an intimate relationship with members of their own sex. ",

            "text": "And there it is.  That's the reason that you are programmed to hate these films.  And I'm not talking about how in 1961 apparently going out and shooting rifles was as normal as playing mini-golf.  I'm talking about how homosexuality was viewed as a mental illness.  Also, the narrator calls the illness contagious.  Here is where people watching this are going to start screaming that the film is promoting hate and ignorance and you can't catch being gay.  But that's not what the film's saying.  Get ready for an extremely unpopular opinion that I share with the filmmakers that I developed using real world experience.  Instead of some study, because unlike NPCs, I trust my eyes and ears over some faceless scientist with an agenda who puts a PDF on the internet.  The film is saying that homosexuality is directly connected to abuse.  Not meaning, by the way... that all homosexuals are abusers, okay?  Meaning that often, childhood abuse leads to adult homosexuality.  Now, as someone that's worked in an industry with a high concentration of gay people, it's been my experience, my real life, real world experience, that this is unbelievably true, okay?  With only one exception, One, every single gay person I have ever known, professionally or otherwise, was not only abused, but they told me about it, okay?  Even the ones I didn't even really know very well, they still managed to somehow come up in conversation, which tells me this was a major event in their lives.  I mean, there was a guy I worked with for like an afternoon, and he told me that he was molested by his uncle in like the four hours that I interacted with this guy.  Every single one of them, except one, who, by the way, I don't even really think counts as an exception, because he told me that when he was a toddler, his mother used to dress him up as a little girl and tell all her friends... that he was her daughter.  So, I don't really think that qualifies as the exception, but he never told me that he was abused, well, you know, explicitly, so I'll give it the one exception.  Now, I'm sure the comment section is going to be filled with people telling me about, oh, study X and study Y says that this or that or that, you know, they're gay and they weren't molested or whatever.  It doesn't fucking matter, okay?  Without exception, and this includes Milo now that I'm thinking about it.  Without exception, every single gay person I have ever worked with or interacted with And we're talking probably about a sample size of at least 100.  Okay?  Every single one of them were either molested or lied and told me that they were molested. ",
