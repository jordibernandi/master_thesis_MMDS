            "text": "Alright everyone, if you're seeing this video and it's on any day other than the upload date, you're probably seeing it autoplay on my YouTube channel.  You should subscribe to the channel because then it won't autoplay anymore and it won't annoy you.  Links are in the description to various pages that I have where you can support my work.  One thing that I did long ago is I realized that the ad-driven internet was a bad idea.  So I don't have ads on my YouTube videos.  If you're seeing an ad at all, it's there due to some copyright glitch or something.  A couple of my songs are covers, and those are copyrighted.  I can understand.  They're monetized.  Everything else is demonetized by default.  I do that because I use ad blocking software, and I figure if I'm not contributing to anyone else's ad revenue, why the hell would I want to, you know, have people contribute to mine?  It didn't make sense.  So I started taking donations.  There are links in the description to Patreon and Subscribestar.  I started selling books.  I've got over 200 volumes available as of making this video, some of which I've written myself, I'm the author, others of which I've edited, a lot of old arcane works from the occult realm mostly.  And now I've also got links in the description to these as well.  My own website and separately from that is just the merchandise page.  If you're interested in things like this, you can get your coffee on in the morning.  You can drink out of your own Stix mug.  And you should definitely clank.  Leave your spoon in when you're drinking coffee.  It makes it taste better.  Trust me.  It's just the way it works.  So I never take any ad revenue.  That, of course, means that I need other forms of income.  I do a great deal of work online.  I do believe that the work that I do has import.  And the videos themselves organically don't generate any revenue at all.  But you can always buy merchandise.  You can always be a patron on Patreon.  You can follow me through Subscribestar.  which has both one-time donation and monthly sort of recurrent donations, by the way.  I'll never force anyone to give me anything, which is what ad revenue really boils down to, because then people have to click through your ads and do a bunch of stuff like that.  But people can always voluntarily support my cause.  And it's always appreciated, too.  It helps me buy the equipment that I need to do what I'm doing.  It helps me get stuff for the garden, honestly, which people seem to enjoy those.  Garden update probably today.  It's a wonderful day outside.  So yes, official website is now up.  There are links in the description to all sorts of other pages.  There are also three cryptocurrency wallets.  I love cryptocurrency.  I think that it's wonderful.  It was funny that people gave me more of it when it was worth less, of course.  And I don't have a problem with that.  I can understand.  I can't remember how much you can actually dilute a Bitcoin.  Like how small a fraction, I mean a decimal place for Bitcoin and stuff can you actually create?  I'm not 100% sure.  I'm sort of new at that, I suppose.  So yeah, you should definitely subscribe and you should go watch some videos.  You know, it's better than anything you're going to see on TV.  So trust me, it's a good time.  Better than I don't know, watching Ben Shapiro or something like that.  Don't melt your mind, kids.  Get off the boob tube and get onto YouTube or BitChute or wherever you're seeing this and watch some videos because it's fun.  And so there are links in the description that are also quite fun.  And trust me, some of those books are great.  The merchandise is great too.  I mean, I've been drinking out of my own cup for a while.  That's about all.  Peace out. ",
