And, well, the webmaster of that site, he goes by the name of Albino Gallopini, he went off the deep end quite a few years ago and started promoting flat earth bullshit in his articles and in his YouTube channel and whatnot.  And I've tried to reason with him several times, and I thought... Completely done with him.  I am boycotting his website. ",

He was actually very interested in what he said about the Capricorn One movie, which was very interesting.  It's a great shame that he has unfortunately swallowed the Flat Earth Kool-Aid, which I agree with you, Jarrah.  I think it's a great disappointment.  But I'm still very interested and I thank the man for the good work he did before that. ",
