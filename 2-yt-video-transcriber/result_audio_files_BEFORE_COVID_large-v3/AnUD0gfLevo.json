            "text": "Hi there, it's your girl Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video I want to talk about the 8 biggest mistakes that I see people making when they try to change their voice.  One, using falsetto as a foundation.  Like a house, a voice requires a strong foundation.  Now, when we talk about a foundation, we're really talking about our source tone and all of the elements that control that.  So that would include our pitch, that would include the way that we use our vocal folds, that would include our airflow and our glottal quotient and these sort of factors.  Now, everybody has essentially four primary ways that we can use the vocal folds.  you may have come across the word vocal registers.  right.  well that's what these are essentially.  there are four of them and we use three of them commonly.  so the first one is your fry register.  It's that kind of sound where it's very croaky, right?  Our next register is our modal voice.  And, you know, that's this area.  That's this area.  All of this is in my modal voice.  It just basically means that I'm using most of my vocal folds.  And then this is what a falsetto sounds like.  So this is our other register.  And this is the one that you want to avoid for using in a feminine voice.  We do not want to construct the foundation out of our voice in falsetto.  It's very difficult to create the proper resonance to sound naturally female if you are in falsetto.  I accidentally stumble into this because they try and emulate a feminine voice without knowing what they're doing, and well, that's a pretty natural way to try and do it at first.  So make sure you're not doing this.  Try to avoid it.  And if you are doing that, it'll typically sound, it'll typically sound like this, right?  or something like this, or you'll have like kind of this stuff.  We don't want any of that, okay?  Number two, an incorrect understanding of resonance.  I see so many people thinking resonance is something in your head or in your chest or something that you're just supposed to magically understand.  It is not these things, okay?  So you'll notice that if I start talking into my hands, my sound starts to change.  That is resonance.  And if I use a smaller container and then I talk into it, it will sound brighter.  That's what's going on inside male and female bodies, which cause them to be different in terms of sound.  Now, that's what we have to understand resonance as, not as a place, not as a magical sensation, not as teeth buzz or anything like that, okay?  Resonance is simply how space and the shape of that space influences the sound that is inside of it, okay?  This is all about shape and contorting shape.  By being able to understand what resonance actually is, we can understand how we can actually control it.  We control resonance by moving around muscles which change the cavity size and the cavity dimensions, right?  Three, hyper focus on the pitch ceiling.  Now pitch is probably the most obvious difference between a male and female voice.  And so many people start to hyper focus on this, but in particular, they hyper focus on getting higher and higher and higher.  Don't make the mistake of focusing on the highest point of your speech.  Focus on the lowest point of your speech.  It doesn't matter how high you can go.  It only matters how low you are not going.  So you are trying to behaviorally delete an entire zone out of your vocal range where you speak, okay?  And that is what you have to do for pitch.  Yes, we want our average to be around 200, 220, you know, 190, whatever you want to cut it at.  But it's very important that our floor be around 150.  Four, releasing the resonance when you go to speak.  So a lot of the exercises that I employ in my practice involve having a student dial in their resonance with a few different basic sounds that allow us to hear resonance better, like your breath or like noise.  and then once their resonance has been dialed in properly, they freeze their body in that position, they try and produce pitch with that resonance, and then they try and produce pitch with that resonance, and then they try and talk and use that resonance.  Most exercises follow a similar behavior.  Now I see so many people who don't catch themselves letting go of their resonance.  So for instance, in this larynx raising exercise, we use the breath, as a way to monitor where our resonance is going.  And then once we set it to the right place, we have to create pitch.  And then we have to talk with it.  Now, a lot of people do something like this.  Do you hear that fall at the beginning?  That is your resonance literally dropping, okay?  And many people don't catch themselves doing this.  And there's a lot of exercises where this kind of behavior occurs.  So you need to make sure that when you have your resonance dialed into the right place, that you don't let go of it, okay?  Five, too breathy or too closed?  This one's simple.  So when we make sound, our vocal folds essentially do this behavior.  The longer that they are closed for, the tighter and more choked off the sound becomes.  And the longer that they're open for, the softer and lighter the sound becomes, commonly associated with breathiness.  People really seem to be on this whole.  female voices are breathier and softer thing.  And so oftentimes I see people who over exaggerate that and they open the vocal folds too much and they sound so like breathy and airy.  We don't want that.  That's not good.  You know, conversely, when people do exercises involving brighter resonance, sometimes they choke the vocal folds.  They choke themselves with their vocal folds.  They close the vocal folds too hard because there's all this excess tension going on when they're doing the exercise.  And then it creates this very nasty croaking sound.  So try and find the Goldilocks zone for your vocal folds.  Not too choked, not too breathy.  Pay attention if you are tensing up too hard during your exercises, because it could be altering that closure here in the neck at the vocal folds, and it could be completely ruining your sound, okay?  So not too breathy, not too closed.  Just right.  Number six, overthinking.  Now, I see people who completely paralyze their progress because they overthink what they're doing instead of just listening and reacting or just listening, evaluating, and moving on.  Instead, they get stuck in this cycle of hyperthinking every little muscle that they're doing in here or trying to sort of hypercontrol their muscles.  We are not very good at hypercontrolling our muscles.  Try and isolate a single muscle on your face and just move that one.  It's very difficult.  And it's because that's not how we think about muscles.  We think about muscles in relation to what function they're trying to perform.  So we think about sound, then we do that sound, and that teaches us the muscular function we're trying to do.  Then we learn from that.  We do not try and top down control everything in our body and think about it all.  Otherwise it becomes so scary and so overwhelming so quickly.  Also, I encourage you not to hyper focus on any individual element.  I encourage every person learning on their own to survey the field and see what techniques are out there, then pick a few techniques and work on them.  Sometimes if you're just focusing on one thing, you can really just get stuck in a rut doing something that may not be the most beneficial for you.  Where if you change ideas and you get to a different practice technique, you might have a breakthrough on that one, okay?  So don't limit your practice to just one thing.  Explore what's out there, try everything, see what works for you, see what doesn't, and play into what does work for you.  It's obviously very important to understand and have information about the process, but we have to draw on that information in a valuable way and not let it control or dominate the process.  Sometimes you just have to get out of your own way.  Number seven, not listening.  If there is a cardinal sin that breaks my little heart more than anything else, it's when you don't use your ears when you practice.  This is about sound, and you have to use your ears and listen to that sound.  Sound is the key to this entire process.  You may think that, oh, well, I don't have a musical background, I can't hear very well, all these different things, but look, you learned an entire language or languages.  Nobody taught you how to speak your language.  You sat in a crib and you listened to your family talk around you all day as a kid and you literally taught yourself through mimicry.  Mimicry is the single most natural form of human education.  And when we do these kind of voice exercises and we do these voice things, it's especially true.  The ability to learn the voice through mimicry is hard coded into you as an individual.  Otherwise you would not be able to speak and you would not be able to think in the way that you do now.  So take advantage of that and play into the fact that you are a biomechanical sound processing unit.  The only way to grow is to notice.  You have to listen and you have to notice.  How is this different?  How is this similar?  How has it changed since last time?  And if your ears aren't very good at first, that's okay.  They get better by actively listening.  Many people do not have Many people do not have a well-developed critical ear, but you can start developing it today.  Just start listening to yourself and asking, how is this different?  How has this changed?  How is it similar than before?  And start dissecting the sound with your ears.  Don't just ask yourself, does this sound male or female?  Ask yourself, what about the sound is wrong?  What about the sound is good?  Can you describe the sound with textures or colors or shapes or geometry or different ideas?  Try to abstractly identify and describe the experience that you're hearing.  And always trust your ear.  I see so many people who are afraid to trust their intuition.  Your ear got you this far in your life.  You've learned the language that you speak now simply through mimicry.  And I think you can learn how to change your voice simply through mimicry too.  Take advantage of the most natural form of human learning.  Just open your ears, reflect, notice, and I promise that you will progress.  Number eight, harshly judging oneself mid-process.  Okay, look, I understand this is an important thing for us, and I understand that it's entangled with our dysphoria, but if we jump to criticizing ourself before we've even started the process, will go nowhere.  okay you have to fail a lot before you can succeed and that is true with anything.  okay honestly please go easy on yourself.  if you're doing an exercise that is about pitch that should be what you're critiquing.  it shouldn't be whether you sound male or female.  it shouldn't be about if you're valid or not.  and look if you need somebody to say it.  Your voice does not determine your validity, okay?  Your identity is valid regardless of what your voice sounds like.  Our voices are nothing more a statement about our identity than chewing our fingernails.  It is literally a behavioral habit.  You just flop your jaw and your tongue in a certain way, and that's the way that you learned when you were a kid, okay?  It's not a statement about who you are in any deeper sense than that.  And that's very important.  I see so many girls with amazing and beautiful voices progressing quickly who just get completely frozen because the moment they open their mouth, they just immediately a wave of self-doubt and a wave of self-criticism take over them.  That is not the way you do this.  Imagine it like this.  You wouldn't try and go learn piano and then sit at the piano and expect to just be able to play Chopin your first day.  You have to build fundamental skills.  And early in this process, when you're building those fundamental skills, you have to be evaluating whether those are growing, not whether you sound male or female.  Yes, it's good to keep sight on the endings.  but you have to look at each lap's progress as well.  You can't just rush straight to the finish line.  This one's incredibly personal for me because I spent probably nine months of my life not progressing with my voice because the moment I opened my mouth, I immediately criticized it as if I was submitting the final example, right?  It wasn't until I realized that my voice is so fluid and I can play with it however I want and it's not that big of a deal was I able to then start spending a lot of time changing it.
