            "text": "I'm Dr.  Dave Janda.  Welcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings.  The goal of these briefings and my weekly radio show, Operation Freedom, is to provide you information.  the bought-off, lamestream, fake media will never present, will never touch.  Why?  Because they want to keep you in the dark.  Why?  Because the more people that are in the dark, the easier it is to strip the remaining freedoms and liberties from every American.  I hope you'll join me every Sunday for the radio show.  It's free.  All you have to do is go to DaveJanda.com, go to the upper right-hand corner, hit the live button, and we're there for you every Sunday from 2 to 5 Eastern.  Great guests, great analysis, great information.  Again, time well spent.  We value you taking the time for coming on this channel to listen to us, on our website, on the radio show.  We're not going to waste your time.  In addition, we're available on this platform and available at davejanda.com.  We have the free, the public side, where we upload information on a regular basis.  But where the real meat of the matter is, is on our subscription platform.  $0.30 a day, $9 a month, I believe one of the biggest bangs for the buck in all the internet.  Extra shows, our WTF Geopolitical show we put up every Wednesday.  Our Insider Insight Show, we bring someone from behind the curtain to discuss issues.  This week, we brought Alex Newman forward from the American Magazine.  Outstanding interview, information about this USMCA agreement, United States, Mexico, Canada agreement.  And then we go into information about the deep state and their involvement in other countries, in particular, South America, and how that South America deep state contingent is adversely affecting every American.  The bought-off, lamestream fake media will never touch that.  So I hope you'll join us on the free side, the public side, the subscription side.  Try it for a month.  If you don't like it, get rid of it.  But not sure why you would.  Because the information, the guests, and the analysis you get, you'll not get from any other source.  The title of today's presentation is Red October for Comrade John Brennan, former director of the CIA under Brennan, and the deep state.  Red October.  You've heard this term utilized before.  I define Red October as an information-based offensive insurgency operation that's directed in one particular spot and one particular entity.  Directed at the deep state.  Now, this really started off with a bang at the end of September by President Trump.  September 24th, President Trump went to the belly of the beast of the deep state, the United Nations.  Now, this past week on Operation Freedom, and podcasts are available for our subscribers, I had Pat Woods on, who has battled the deep state.  with his partner in the past, Antony C. Sutton, who passed away a number of years ago.  But since the 1970s, Pat and Antony dissected the deep state.  They were considered to be, of course, the usual CIA term conspiracy theorists.  In fact, it was conspiracy reality.  And the information that they presented in the 1970s as accurate today as it was back then.  It was well ahead of its time.  That interview with Pat Wood is outstanding.  And it dissects the United Nations.  And President Trump went there on September 24th and delivered a speech.  It was a declaration of war against the globalists.  I've discussed this in my video YouTube presentation last Tuesday.  If you haven't watched that, it's two-part.  I suggest you do so.  It is him speaking directly to the globalists in attendance.  This from Graham Noble from LibertyNation.com.  President Trump to the United Nations.  The future does not belong to the globalists.  Imagine he went to the belly of the beast and let him have it right between the eyes.  The speech was wide-ranging, but the overriding theme was the importance of national pride and sovereignty to every country.  Quote, the future, Trump told the Assembly, quote, does not belong to globalists.  End quote.  In addition to providing an overview of America's foreign policy challenges, the president berated China for its unfair trade practices and its violation of obligations made to the people of Hong Kong.  He called for the empowerment of women as well.  This speech directed against the globalists, and in particular China.  China, as Pat Wood has outlined, is a technocracy, a deep state globalist model of democracy.  The state running you from crib to grave.  Not only running you, robbing you.  And enriching themselves.  There is a reason why President Trump highlighted China and their abuses.  Because China is the, if you will, business success model of the technocracy movement.  the New World Order group, the globalists, the deep state, however you want to define them.  To close his address, the President delivered to the gathered world leaders and ambassadors a message of unity, peace, and recognition that, like the United States, every country in the world should, first and foremost, act in the interest of its own people.  Quote, lift up your nations, cherish your culture, honor your histories, treasure your citizens, make your country strong and prosperous and righteous.  Honor the dignity of your people and nothing will be outside your reach.  End quote.  On that same day, September 24th, the prelude to Red October, Nancy Pelosi came out and announced an impeachment inquiry.  Now, many people have become despondent, have become upset, have become beyond worried that this is going to be the end of the freedom movement, of President Trump's administration.  Come on.  Give your head a shake.  This isn't the end.  It's just the beginning.  And this impeachment inquiry is not out of a position of power that puppet Pelosi of the deep state has come forward with.  It's from fear, from weakness, from desperation.  She hasn't even held a vote on the articles of impeachment.  So all these subcommittees that are sending these subpoenas, they're not subpoenas.  They haven't made a vote.  The judiciary hasn't even issued these.  No.  Why?  Because they haven't had the formal vote.  These are just letters.  Nobody has to comply with a letter from a subcommittee.  And what's this, quote, impeachment issue based on, inquiry based on?  Vapor.  My advisor in college, Bucknell.  I graduated from Bucknell University, obtained a bachelor's degree, double majored in chemistry and economics.  My advisor in chemistry was a very well-known analytical chemist.  That was my subspecialty, analytical chemistry.  His name was Hans Vini.  And he used to refer to the liberal arts community as being vapor merchants.  He used to have a chuckle about that.  But in fact, the vapor merchants of today are the deep state puppets.  Vapor that magically disappears because there's no substance to it.  The substance of this impeachment inquiry is based on gossip blowers.  They should not be dignified by saying they're whistleblowers.  Real whistleblowers are people like Bill Binney.  and Kirk Wiebe, who are regular guests on this platform.  There are people like Dennis Montgomery, who came forward years ago about an illegal surveillance parallel platform that many have denied exists.  All parallel platforms, according to these people, all parallel platforms don't exist.  Really?  Really?  Then why was the FBI flying people around to get evidence that he was turning in?  Why did they bring him into a skiff for a three-hour interview and then give him full immunity?  Why did the general counsel of the FBI under Obama testify under oath in October of 2018 before Congress?  Then he sent a team down to get information that Montgomery had presented.  that revealed, quote, government officials... illegally surveilling other government officials and American citizens, end quote.  You see, that's a real whistleblower.  Real whistleblowers don't have wonderful stories written about them in the bought-off, lamestream fake media like the Washington Post or the New York Times.  They get their doors kicked in.  Yeah, that's what happened to Bill Binney.  That's what happened to Kirk Weavey.  That's what happened to Dennis Montgomery.  In fact, Sidney Powell retweeted an article that had been published, the real whistleblower story, Dennis Montgomery, the hammer, the hard drives, the wiretapping of Trump, and the prosecution of General Flynn.  Published in the American Report, and I'll have the link below.  It's a long article.  You need to read it because the information in that article is critical.  It is a deep dive on the deep state and what Red October is all about.  The article was published on September 27th.  Sidney Powell, who has been a guest on this platform, I consider her a friend.  She is General Flynn's lead attorney who has taken on the deep state in hand-to-hand combat, General Flynn being a patriot and an innocent man who's not only fighting for his freedom, but the freedom of every American.  She retweeted that at 2 o'clock on September 27th.  By 6  p.m.,  the Justice Department had issued a press release.  You see, in this article, an individual by the name of Deborah Curtis was highlighted about her being the one who accepted the information about the illegal surveillance through the hammer back in 2015.  And it appears good old Deborah... was responsible for deep-sixing that information, and it was highlighted in that article that Sidney retweeted.  6 p.m.  that evening, the article was published.  Deborah Curtis, it was announced by the Department of Justice, was no longer the lead prosecutor in the Flynn case, and also was announced through the Department of Justice.  she was no longer employed by the Department of Justice.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But then again, maybe not.  See, that's a real whistleblower.  Not the gossip blowers that have been fabricated out of vapor.  By who?  By deep state puppet John Brennan and the CIA.  You see, the CIA is the heart of what Red October is all about and what it's being directed at.  It's about outing the deep state puppets, anyone and everyone, at the CIA.  that's associated with this coup, attempted coup, of a duly elected president of the United States.  You see, their first efforts didn't work so well with the whole Russian hoax that they were behind.  But now they've turned to the Ukrainian hoax.  The first whistleblower, well, not a gossip blower, had the information.  second and third hand, was, according to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, who is suspect.  And we have gotten into that particular Inspector General and their background on my subscription platform.  Information the fake media will never present.  You see, that first whistleblower was a gossip blower and not a whistleblower.  second- and third-hand information, was biased against Donald Trump to begin with, employed by the CIA, had been employed by the CIA, worked at the National Security Council in the White House, and then back at the CIA, and then all of a sudden became a gossip blower.  Why?  Because he was essentially a sleeper agent, a sleeper cell.  We talk about terrorists being sleeper cells.  This is another type of terrorist.  They're sleeper cells.  They're sleeper cells for the deep state.  In this case, the handler of this gossip blower was John Brennan.  Just as this second whistleblower that supposedly has information but yet didn't turn in a whistleblower complaint appears to have verified what the first whistleblower said, and experts that have looked at what the first gossip blower said, there were 15 mistakes in that document that was turned in.  The impeachment inquiry.  is based on vapor.  Vapor produced, constructed, and blown open by deep state puppets, the head of the snake of which is John Brennan.  There will be, I'm sure, gossip blowers three, four, five, six, seven, because it's not gaining traction.  President Trump's popularity is rising. ",
