            "text": "Hey everybody, today I want to talk to you about some things that you need to take care of in your preps that I haven't addressed in other videos.  And a friend of mine named Sharon had reminded me today, she made the suggestion that I cover some of these items.  And it was an excellent suggestion.  It had crossed my mind in the past, but long since forgotten.  So I'm glad that she brought that up.  So thank you, Sharon.  I really appreciate it.  okay what i wanted to address was uh things that you can take care of before a shift situation takes place you know or a raw situation you know without rule of law or tiawaki you know the end of the world as we know it.  uh so these things should be taken care of first very important.  and uh you do this and then the stuff hits the fan afterwards.  trust me you'd thank me.  so and Sharon.  so here you go.  okay.  first of all dental.  if you have any toothaches currently or you know that you need a root canal and you've been putting it off you know if you have any teeth that are broken and you know they need to be pulled do it now.  do it now while you can because if If things turn sour in the country, they go south, and it's a shift situation, okay?  You aren't going to be able to do that.  And if you are in the kind of pain that you guys know that a toothache, a rotten tooth, or a root canal can bring on, you will be miserable.  Absolutely miserable.  Not to mention that if it's a root canal, that infection can cause you health issues.  And if it gets in your bloodstream, it can kill you.  So, Take care of any dental work that you need to take care of now while you have time to do it.  It's very important, just a thought.  Okay, next, if you have any problems with your eyes, take care of them now.  If you use glasses, like I do, get a prescription and go online and get a couple of those two-for-one deals on glasses, just some cheap glasses.  You don't care what you look like, okay?  If it's a shift situation, your general appearance will be the last thing on your mind.  Get a couple pair of glasses so that you can put them in your bug-out bag or your preps, wherever that may be, in your home or trailer or whatever you've got.  Get a pair of extra couple pair of glasses because glasses break.  Glasses get taken off and forgotten frequently.  So that is very important.  If you wear bifocals and that's all you need is reading glasses, just go down to Dollar General or something and buy a couple of those $6 cheap pair reading glasses.  I have a pair that I use because I'm waiting for my actual glasses and I can't read without the cheap reading glasses.  So get some of those things from DG.  Couple a pair because they're so cheap.  Set them aside so that you have them, okay?  That'll cover your eyes if you have to.  um see if i'm forgetting anything excuse me.  um if you have any surgeries that you need to take care of this is one that sharon had thrown out and i totally agree with.  this.  is one of those tmi situations?  too much information you didn't ask for But I had a hernia on both sides of myself for a year before I took care of it.  And I only took care of it because it brought me to my knees one day unexpectedly.  If you know that you have a hernia situation that you need to take care of and you've been putting it off, Get it taken care of.  Is it going to cost a fortune?  Yes, it's going to cost a fortune.  You can't get around it.  But you certainly don't want to go into a shift situation without a hernia being taken care of.  You just don't want to do that.  Okay, if you know that you need knee replacement surgery, Do it now, okay?  Yes, it's going into debt.  I totally understand that.  I had $120,000 hospital bill for my back.  I totally understand.  I have rods and screws, metal bars and screws in my back and several fused discs.  I know what it costs.  I understand.  But if you need to have it done, you need to have it done.  Knee replacement surgery, is like a two day thing two or three day thing and you're out of the hospital.  okay my mom's had it my neighbors have had it.  it's no big deal.  but if you don't have it it can be a big deal if you need it so do that.  um what else?  um hearing aids?  okay if you wear hearing aids um know they're only going to work as long as you have batteries to make them work.  okay if you could afford a second pair of hearing aids which i'm not sure is the best idea because your hearing changes.  but if you could i would get a second pair of hearing aids.  put them aside.  but even if not okay go to whatever, Walmart, Dollar General, your local hearing place, and buy stock up on several, several packs of hearing aid batteries.  You know how fast you go through them.  I know how fast my grandmother goes through them.  So get some hearing aid batteries.  They're cheap.  I mean, as preps go, they're cheap, okay?  I know batteries can be silly expensive, but as your preps go, those are some cheap fixes.  Get some batteries.  Remember that you're going to need over-the-counter meds.  A lot of people don't think about that.  Think about this.  If you're in a shift situation, no hospitals are available to be used or whatever. ",
