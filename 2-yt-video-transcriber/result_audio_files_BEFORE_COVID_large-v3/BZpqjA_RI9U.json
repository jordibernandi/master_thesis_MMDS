            "text": "Hi, I'm Dr.  Dave Janda.  Welcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings.  The goal of these briefings and my weekly radio show, Operation Freedom, is to provide you information the bought-off, lamestream, fake media will not provide.  You can join us every Sunday from 2 to 5 Eastern at DaveJanda.com.  You can stream the show live.  Great guests, great analysis.  All you have to do is go to DaveJanda.com, hit the upper right-hand corner of the listen button, and... You can stream the show live, but the platform is more than a radio show.  We're there two to five Eastern, but we're also there 24 seven at davejanda.com.  We have the free, the public side where we upload information on a regular basis.  We all also have the subscription side, 30 cents a day, nine bucks a month.  You can sign up for a month if you don't like it, get rid of it, but not sure why, because the information you get, you're not going to see in the bought off lamestream fake media.  The title of today's presentation is president Trump's formula for for melting the lamestream fake media.  First of all, I'd like to thank you for all the comments you provided in my last video about adoption, abortion, and the future of our country.  If you haven't had an opportunity to watch that video, I suggest you try to take some time and do so.  I believe of all the videos I've done, it is the best video and I believe probably the most long-lasting video I will have done as it relates to our country's future.  I hope you take the time to watch it.  In this particular topic, let's talk about what President Trump is doing and his team is doing to melt the media.  Now, many people believe that when Donald Trump tweets, when Donald Trump makes statements, that they're just off the cuff.  They're not.  I truly believe that there is a method, if you want to call it, to his madness.  Couple headlines.  Media industry loses about a thousand jobs as layoffs hit news organizations.  This week reaffirmed just how dire things have gotten within the industry, with about 1,000 jobs in the media lost as a result of layoffs announced at BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, and Gannett, the nation's largest newspaper chain.  BuzzFeed announced this past week it would lay off 15% of its workforce, or about 220 employees.  Verizon announced it would cut 7% or approximately 800 jobs from its media division, which includes brands like Huffington Post, AOL, and Yahoo News.  And Gannett also slashed dozens of jobs in newspapers across the country.  Another headline from Zero Hedge.  Digital media bloodbath continues.  New vice CEO cuts 10% of staff.  Shifts focus.  Following mass layoffs at BuzzFeed, The Huffington Post, Gannett, and Verizon Media Group last week, Vice Media has become the latest trendy news media, darling, to announce deep cuts to staffing levels.  The cuts, which will be distributed across all departments at every level, will total roughly 10% of the company's workforce.  So... Actually, some folks in the mainstream media actually reported some of this.  But no one has really looked at, wait, why is the media melting like this?  What's happening?  Well, I did a little research on this and here's what I've come up with.  Let's go back to December 23rd, 2016.  Now remember, whenever we get around the holidays, this is where these deep state players love to jam legislation through.  that is out of the news cycle.  December 23rd, 2016.  Donald Trump has been elected president.  He hasn't taken office yet.  Barack Obama is still in the Oval Office.  Statement by President Obama on signing the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017.  This is December 23rd, 2016.  Today I have signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017.  This act authorizes fiscal year 2017 appropriations principally for the Department of Defense and for the Department of Energy national security programs.  So what does this have to do with the media?  My administration strongly supports the bill's structural reform of the Broadcasting Board of Governors , which streamlines BBG operations and reduces inefficiencies while retaining the long-standing statutory firewall, protecting against interference with, and maintaining the professional independence of the agency's journalists and broadcasters and thus their credibility as sources of independent news and information.  remember that cia program called project mockingbird where what they did is they infiltrated all major news outlets to get the agenda across the deep state Headline from Zero Hedge.  This is December 26th, 2016.  Obama quietly signed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act into law.  What?  Late on December 23rd, 2016, with the U.S.  population embracing the upcoming holidays and oblivious of most news emerging from the administration... by design, Obama quickly signed into law the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes $611 billion for the military in 2017.  But while the passage of the NDAA and the funding of the U.S.  military was hardly a surprise, the biggest news is what was buried deep inside the provisions of the Defense Authorization Act.  What was hidden in the authorization?  was the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act.  In early June 2016, quote, a bill to implement the U.S.  very own de facto Ministry of Truth had been quietly introduced in Congress.  As with any legislation attempting to dodge the public spotlight, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016 marked a further curtailment of press freedom and another avenue to stultify avenues of accurate information.  Introduced by Congressman Adam Kinzinger and Ted Lieu.  They've been pretty prominent, actually, in this whole, oh, the fake Russian hack narrative.  A whole government approach without the bureaucratic restrictions to counter foreign disinformation and manipulation.  The bill would task the Secretary of State with coordinating the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, uh-oh, there's that BBG thing again, to, quote, establish a Center for Information Analysis and Response, end quote, which will pinpoint sources of disinformation, alternative media, guilty, Analyze data and in true dystopic manner, develop and disseminate fact-based narratives to counter effrontery propaganda.  In other words, to confront and to take on, to counter the truth, we're going to hire these propagandists in the bought-off, lamestream, fake media.  And you wonder why I call it bought-off?  It's right here.  Fast forward to December 8, 2016, when the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act passed in the Senate.  But then, oh, what happened?  It was quietly inserted in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act Conference Report.  This is a bill that further chips away at press liberties in the United States and which sets the stage for future witch hunts and website shutdowns, purely as a result of an accusation that one media outlet or site is considered as a source of disinformation and propaganda and is shut down by the government.  The legislation establishes a fund to help train local journalists, you know, Rachel Maddow, Morning Joe, Nina Brzezinski, oh, Anderson Cooper, and provide grants and contracts to who?  Non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, think tanks like the open society you think run by george soros.  private sector companies oh like abc of disney verizon yeah media organizations all the above and other experts outside the U.S.  government with experiencing in identifying and analyzing the latest trends in foreign government disinformation techniques.  It will also empower a decentralized network of private sector experts.  Morning Joe, Nika, Wright, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Maddow.  Shep Smith, and integrate their expertise into the strategy of making progress and process.  Just like that, the U.S.  Ministry of Truth is officially born.  Wow.  So why are these media organizations melting if they've been funded?  Ah, did a little more digging for you.  Here's what I found out.  In fiscal year 2018, Trump's first budget, guess what he cut?  Guess what he cut?  He cut the funding to the BBG, Obama's little propaganda arm that he shoveled in there right before he moonwalked out of town, right?  Well, he's still in town actually at that point.  That mansion that has a wall around it.  Imagine that.  Why would he need a wall when we don't need a wall in the southern... I don't know.  Shocking.  Trump, in his first budget, cut the BBG, this propaganda arm in the media, by how much?  63 million.  And then he doubled down this past year and cut it by another 24 million.  And that, folks, as Paul Harvey used to say, is the rest of the story.  The reason why the bought-off, lamestream, fake media is melting, all these layoffs, why they're just imploding... is because what President Trump and his team have done behind the curtain in cutting their budget, which was hidden in the National Defense Authorization Act for an organization called the BBG.  And you're not going to hear a word of this from the bought-off, lamestream fake media because they've been sucking in all your tax revenue to fund their propaganda.  Thank you for joining me today.
