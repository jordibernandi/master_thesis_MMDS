It's kind of a lengthy process, and when it's done, hopefully nobody even notices that anything was done to him, but it's age spots, it's layers of plastic that make it so that his skin will wrinkle.  He has incredibly smooth skin for his age, which is not ideal for someone like myself who wants to take this guy and make him several decades older. ",

This particular technique was so durable he could sleep in it and we could use it the next day with minimal touch up.  And normally, the normal techniques you would use to do that, you would be doing those same type of touch ups halfway through the day.  It just doesn't hold up that well.  In the makeup industry, this gave us what we refer to as bulletproof.  Very tough, durable, waterproof, sweat proof, and it just lasted for a really long time. ",

He spent over an hour just to make me look old and wrinkly.  So it took some time, but Doug was, I mean, just like I said, all the staff, Doug and Kathy Henderson were wonderful.  Everybody there who helped out just really have a servant's heart, and so it really made it pleasurable.  There was always patience and time, and I enjoyed the conversations.  The time went well.  I thought I'd be more tired than I was, but we seemed to have the energy of what do we need to do to get it done.  Thank you. ",
