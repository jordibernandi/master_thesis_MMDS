            "text": "Sexual objectification is a big deal in 2019.  Hello everyone.  My name is Jennifer Malesky and this is my YouTube channel.  I'd love if you subscribed, if you liked this video, share it with a friend, press the little notifications bell.  It'll be amazing.  We can spend all the time together in the world.  So what is objectification?  Let's look it up on the internet.  Objectification, the action of degrading someone to the status of a mere object.  This is peculiar to me just right off the bat.  Have you ever went on a date or talked to a friend about how their date went and they said to you, you know, I just kind of knew right away.  it wasn't a connection.  If we expound on that sentence, they're saying this.  I knew right away from how they looked and how they presented themselves without them saying anything, without knowing their humor, their intelligence, or anything about their personality.  I just knew that they weren't for me.  objectification.  But let's not talk about the individual quite yet.  I know people don't really like to do that.  So let's talk about media, commercials, how sex sells.  A lot of people have a gripe with that.  The sexual objectification of women sells.  How dare it?  It just must be a social construct, nothing to do with biology.  But I would say for people that have a problem with commercials, I think a good rule of thumb would be don't get your morals wrong.  from the media or from commercials.  With bacon strips, bacon jam, and bacon crumbles.  It's a bacon lover's fantasy. ",

            "text": "But for all the howling that women do of how objectification is the worst and companies shouldn't do it, they're often the ones that consume those products.  Now, I'm not talking about bacon burgers necessarily.  I am talking about the thing that promotes objectification.  Well, first let's talk about that.  When is a woman typically objectified?  And if you think that all men objectify all women, then you're already out of the game, okay?  So some women are objectified more than others.  What are some tools used to purposefully and potentially become sexually objectified?  Well, we alter the way we look with makeup.  We alter how we smell with perfume.  We alter how our boobs sit by bras.  We alter how our butts look by butt lifts.  We color our lips with lipstick.  We make our eyes look prettier with mascara.  All of these products are sold to us by showing not disgusting women, but by women that look beautiful because we want to look beautiful because we.  Life is a competition.  And if they're not buying, then they're competing for market space.  Look at Forbes.  Look at what Forbes has to say.  They're pointing out how many women are going to be taking over this beauty industry.  So women are going to be creating businesses that help women objectify themselves and then complain about it.  It's so fitting.  But I will say that there are some women who just won't stand for it.  Like this cute little 17-year-old girl.  She created a whole petition on Change.org to pretty much bully Seventeen Magazine into stopping using airbrush for their models.  Seventeen Magazine agreed.  2019, Seventeen Magazine.  Autoprint.  Thanks, 17-year-old advocate of beauty that no one actually wants to look at the pictures of non-airbrushed people because you can see them if you leave the house and that's boring.  Again, like I said, if you're not bullying, you're buying.  And you're not buying because you hate the idea of what they're doing, selling objectification.  You're buying it because it works.  Women compete against other women for high quality men.  And here, here's the fair part of it.  Men compete with other men for high quality women.  It's almost as if this has been going on for a long time and it's biological.  When a beautiful woman walks into a room, everybody notices, the men and the women, right?  Men are either excited and they kind of peacock or they become really nervous and really weird because the woman that they're with becomes really nervous and really weird.  Typically a little hostile.  Why?  Because women don't like competition against other women.  Oh, it must be a social construction.  No, it's biological.  But we as a species have been using sexual objectification for a really long time.  Because it really works.  Here's how it works.  You find a guy and you think, wow, that guy's really attractive.  And they look at you and they think, wow, that woman's really attractive.  And then you talk.  And then the filtration starts to begin on what is most important.  Humor, values, what you want in life.  All these things start with the objectification.  First, you have to mutually objectify each other.  Here's where things go wrong.  The sexual revolution.  Women pined to be hedonistic, okay?  They wanted sex without repercussions.  They wanted free love, and they got it.  In 1961, the pill was brought to the world.  It was legal for married women.  Later, it was legal for every woman.  1967, abortion... decriminalized.  So now we have the ability for women to go out like men and not look for a value partner necessarily, but just to go out and meet a man to have fun with, just to have some fun.  Hey, we have needs too.  But this is the problem.  Women want their cake, and they want to eat it too.  They want all the respect, but they want to act like a whore.  The problem with today is that women are giving it up much easier.  They want a man to respect them and look at them for their characteristics, how smart they are, their sense of humor, their worldliness, how cultured they are.  But they're not giving men the opportunity to take the time to actually get to know those things.  They want to meet a guy and fulfill their sexual needs.  The woman wants to fulfill her sexual needs.  And then she gets mad when the guy just treats her like a sexual object.  Women want sexual freedom, yet they get mad at men who know that that's what they want.  Just like women don't want men who are too available, men typically don't want women who are sluts.  It used to be, and like this or not, but because women in general were not sleeping with multiple men, sex had a much higher value because it wasn't easily obtained.  And in exchange for constant sex throughout a lifetime, a man would provide for a woman.  Hey, I'll give you shelter.  I'll give you food, you sleep with me.  And she's like, that sounds good.  That seems like a good deal.  And the guy was like, hey, you have sex with me.  And then if we create a kid from that, which is most likely, then you help nurture the kid and I'll pay for the mortgage and I'll buy the food and I'll protect you.  And the woman was still like, yeah, that's a good, I like that idea.  But now women want to be men and men want to be women.  And actually, there's no gender difference at all.  So this is all very highly confusing.  Women is quite simple.  If you don't want to be objectified, offer more to the world than quick sex.  You know, I haven't made a lot of videos, but it all really comes down to self-responsibility.  If you want to be treated with self-respect, then you have to respect yourself.  Love yourself so much that you showcase all the amazing things about you that are not your looks and your appearance.  And if you do that, and if you can get your friends to do that, and you can get your community to do that, then media will change.  But you can't change media.  You have to change yourself.  Self-responsibility.  Oh, people hate it.  They hate it, but it's a really great solution.  Until next time, take responsibility for yourself.  Value yourself.  Go into the world and be an amazing human. ",
