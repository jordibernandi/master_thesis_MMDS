            "text": "I'm here to kick ass and think about slimes, and I'm all out of asses.  My last video was about the cognitive dissonance required to believe that a shitty joke is just a joke, and thus immune to criticism, but also something which makes an important political message that must be protected.  I spoke about the ways that this double standard is used to be able to take potshots at marginalized groups and then retreat from criticism of that type of ding-dongitude.  And a few people responded, so, like... What are you, a liberal now?  To be honest, that really buttered my biscuits.  There is a tendency among some of us here on the left to leap at any opportunity to disregard the better angels of our nature.  Any self-righteous excuse that allows us a chance to give in to our antisocial impulses.  Take a moment right now to divorce those qualities from whoever you assume I'm attributing them to and recognize that should they exist, those qualities themselves are bad things.  I believe with my whole heart that the core of leftist politics is, and always should be, kindness.  I believe that socialism is, first and foremost, a moral position.  For it to be otherwise reduces it to the same banal, anti-humanistic calculation that capitalism has always been.  While I believe in the material benefits of socialism, the very fact that I want those material benefits to reach more people is itself a moral position.  It's so fucking hot in Toronto.  I'm so sweaty today.  I'm sweatier than I've ever been.  No doubt some of you will accuse me of moralizing.  And yeah, no shit.  You're goddamn right.  I'm moralizing.  If the left is not kind, then what are we even doing here?  Now let me back up here and get this out of the way.  I'm not talking about being kind to me.  People are already overwhelmingly kind to me.  And my job is to make political polemics on YouTube, and that comes with a certain assumed level of unkindness.  And in the grand scheme of things, it's not really worth worrying about whether or not someone said some shitty thing about me.  It might piss me off, but it should be no skin off your nose.  I'm not talking about whatever beef you have with me or whoever.  I don't care.  That's not my point.  Now, in some cases, it might be symptomatic of my point, but I'm not here to cast judgment on whether or not you're justified to dislike me or fucking Chapo Trap House or ContraPoints or whatever.  I am not going to go into more discourse over so-called cancel culture, so let us not center the lefty e-celebs in this discussion, please.  I mean, I know that I'm literally centered in frame right now, and I'm talking about, look, you get left-wing politics.  Socialism should be rooted in compassion.  The reason that I want to abolish class is because I believe that it causes people to suffer.  And I want for each and every person to be able to become the best version of themselves, to not be held back by arbitrary restrictions, not to be diminished and harmed by the violent exploitation of the moneyed class.  While I believe that socialism can produce the greatest standard of living for the most people, its productive capacity is not what makes me support it.  If I based my economic position on which economic system was capable of creating the most potatoes... Okay, slavery could probably produce the most potatoes.  We don't need to produce the most potatoes.  We need to produce as many potatoes as we need, and to distribute those potatoes to whoever needs them.  The unique benefit of socialism isn't that it's able to make more stuff or to make better quality stuff.  I do believe that it will be able to do those things, and it may do those things as needed, but that is not the point.  The point is that production would adapt to serve human need, to provide for people rather than grow arbitrarily, commodify necessities for profit, or produce for the sake of production itself.  any scientific or rational evidence you can concoct to show how socialism is superior to capitalism, which, once again, I believe that it is, rests on the moral conviction that it is better for fewer people to be poor, for fewer people to starve, for fewer people to waste their lives in pursuit of shareholder dividends.  In other words, it is based on compassion, on kindness.  Likewise, anywhere there is unkindness, anywhere unkindness is institutionalized, that is part of the same struggle.  The struggle to free people from unnecessary and arbitrary suffering, and allow them to be able to live the lives that are most fulfilling for them.  Racism.  Sexism.  Cisheteronormativity.  Classism.  Ableism.  These things should all be opposed on the same moral basis as capitalism.  On compassion for the oppressed.  And if you happen to be oppressed by any of these things, or all of these things, that includes compassion for yourself.  It's good to be angry at oppressors.  It's natural.  It's human.  When someone does something which harms people, it should make you angry.  But anger alone is not enough.  If we base our movement on anger towards oppressors instead of compassion for the oppressed, we are giving in to the logic of the oppressor.  We're just trying to out-compete them.  We're trying to punish them, and hoping that when we have control, that punishment will serve as a warning to future would-be oppressors not to try shit.  And maybe that'll work, but more likely it just means that a stronger oppressor has to step up to the plate.  How effectively are people going to be able to fight back against an endless string of would-be oppressors if we don't prioritize building them up and giving them the means to defend themselves?  To simply crush the oppressors and do nothing to combat the effects of their oppression will inevitably leave the door open for reaction.  Hey, these guys said that they would be different when they got rid of those other guys, but things are the same.  Now join me and let's take them down too, and then things will be different.  It's giving into the same macho, dick-waving, patriarchal bullshit that keeps these assholes in power in the first place.  Might does not make right just because the guys you were expressing that might over happen to deserve it in this case.  Now, I'm not going to say we need to be kind to oppressors.  We don't need to be nice to billionaires or Nazis or TERFs or whatever.  To do so is to be fundamentally unkind to the people that they oppress and harm.  Make no mistake, the current order must be destroyed and overthrown.  However, it's not enough to merely destroy and overthrow the current order.  It isn't enough to tear down the establishment.  We must also uplift the people who have been underserved by the establishment.  We need to do both.  Imagine how your life looks in a revolution.  I bet you can picture yourself bravely wielding your cyber-katana as you mow down legions of Zuckerbots.  But who's doing the dishes?  Who's looking after?  the kids, the elderly, or the infirm?  A lot of people ask me why I don't own a gun.  First of all, I'm Canadian, so we can't buy big piles of guns to have sex with or whatever you do with them in the States.  But even if I could, what the fuck am I going to do with a gun?  Go hunting?  For what?  Tofu?  Do you think I, Thought Slime, the guy who almost cried when he talked about a Superman comic he liked, am going to be a huge benefit to you in a firefight?  If so, I have given you a very strange perception of my skill set.  To base our ideology on anger towards the ruling class is a shaky foundation, because it does not matter who the ruling class are.  What matters is that there is a ruling class.  To base our ideology on kindness for those they rule over will invariably lead to you being angry at the ruling class, but in the latter case, once the ruling class is deposed, work remains to be done.  We don't simply beat the bad guys and assume everything will be chill after that.  We got to make a sustained effort at dismantling the toxic patterns of domination and apathy that created those bad guys.  Otherwise, all we'll have done is created a power vacuum, made space for an even bigger asshole to rule over us.  One who decides we're not, we can't have soda anymore.  Thanks a lot, revolution.  I like soda.  It was good in moderation.  I grow weary of this topic.  It bores me.  Perhaps I should take a vacation.  Perhaps to some sort of zone.  Eyeballs here.  Get your eyeballs.  Oh, hi.  Hello and welcome to the eyeball zone.  The only zone where I get to put eyes on stuff.  Now, if you're anything like me, sometimes you want to learn about the ways that toxic masculinity can push radical ideas into reactionary directions.  But that also sounds really heavy and hard to deal with.  What if at the same time you could talk about Danny Boyle's masterpiece 28 Days Later?  Huntress Thompson's got you covered.  Good thing you had those extremely specific asks.  Because she happened to make a video about exactly that.  What are the odds?  Check out her video 28 Days Later or How to Ruin a Revolution.  And then, also maybe get yourself a glass of water and sit comfortably because you'll probably find yourself binge-watching the rest of her content.  There you go, you jackals.  I've given you a recommendation for this week.  Except, wait a minute.  You have two eyeballs, don't you?  If not, oops!  That was an insensitive assumption on my part.  This one's a little different, and honestly, I'm not sure if my work or this video are an appropriate venue for it, but I figured I might as well give it a shot.  A person by the name of Aaron emailed me to say that their aunt has been suffering from Wilson's disease, and as a result, needs a donation of liver tissue.  A successful donor would grow back the tissue that they donate.  If you live in Ontario, the procedure is covered by OHIP, and you'd be compensated for any time off from work you'd have to take as a result.  If this is something you'd be willing to consider, check out the screening questionnaire linked in the description, and send an email to liverdonationinquiries at gmail.com.  And please, for the love of God, don't be a dick to this person.  I get that a lot of people who watch these videos are mad at me, but please don't take it out on them.  Take it out on me, please.  Do you need a piping hot cup of eyeballs poured all over your explicitly leftist project?  A lot of people do.  I'm really stressed out about what I'm going to do about it.  I get so many requests.  But anyone can send an email over at thoughtslimeeditor at gmail.com and maybe you'll find yourself trapped here in the eyeball zone.  And now, Thought Slime.  Thanks, Thought Slime!  Personally, I think if there's one thing I can do to lay the seeds for social revolution, it's try to influence people to be kind to one another, to empathize with one another, to let go of their hyper-individualized, atomized, aloof culture of cruelty that has come to dominate the new media landscape.  I think if we're not willing to interrogate the ways that our actions harm others, if we're not ready to confront the abuses and microaggressions that sow discord between people who should be allies in this fight, if we can't practice that now, we're not going to do it in your hypothetical post-capitalist society either.  And yet the Ding Dong Left always argues that these things are a distraction.  We can sort out how to speak to one another, how to treat one another at a later time, because we have a ticking clock.  We overthrow capitalism, or climate change will destroy all our cool stuff.  So what if I use slurs?  We have bigger problems right now.  Don't get distracted.  Interestingly, though, that logic never gets reversed.  How about you stop using slurs while the clock is ticking, and then once we're finished the important work, we can go back and hash it out?  No, it's always the people asking that we treat one another with basic human respect that are told to shut up.  The people that try to create a nurturing atmosphere where all feel welcome are told that they are frightening away.  the people who are more comfortable acting disrespectfully and unwelcoming.  If someone offends you by, say, I don't know, calling you the R-word, you should just suck it up, princess.  Don't be so sensitive.  After all, if you criticize them for that, they might get offended by that and leave.  And on some level, I understand the logic to this argument.  After all, nobody likes being told they're being an asshole.  Every single time someone has pointed out when I was being an asshole, I have hated it.  So if your goal is to build a big tent movement, you can't be a scold.  People don't like being around scolds.  You have to pick your battles.  I get that.  I mean, I get it, but I'm not convinced by it.  I think we lose more people in our spaces by allowing performative cruelty than we do by criticizing it.  I don't understand why we should work so hard to keep shitty, disruptive people at the expense of everyone else.  But I understand the argument, and I understand the cost-benefit analysis that goes into it.  Our enemies don't have to worry about things like this.  They can be cruel, they can revel in cruelty, because cruelty suits their interests.  Cruelty benefits the status quo.  Normalizing cruelty isolates people, keeps them from uniting against their shared oppression.  It turns the world into the type of competition that they think rewards the strong, but in fact rewards the vicious.  That cruelty helps them build coalitions of gleeful assholes that get their rocks off being cruel.  When you see that, it's tempting, isn't it?  Don't you want to build a big coalition like that?  Wouldn't that be useful?  Maybe you can't get them to agree about everything, but you can get them to understand the struggle against capitalism.  After all, that directly affects them.  They are made poor.  They don't need to be kind or empathetic people to understand that.  Maybe they're not woke enough for the SJW left, but they're committed to overthrowing capitalism so long as they see a benefit in it for them personally.  But there's a problem with that approach.  Radicalization works both ways, so what happens when these fair-weather allies get a better pitch from somewhere else?  If they only care about overthrowing capital because it suits them to overthrow capital.  But continue to view society as a struggle between the strong and the weak.  To view racial and sexual minorities, the disabled, and women as disposable.  What happens when the Nos Bowls come a-knocking?  Maybe they care about the environment and they want to save it by any means necessary.  Look, we've got a ticking clock and we can't afford to bicker back and forth about ideological purity tests.  We have to make hard choices and we have to be willing to accept drastic solutions.  What happens when the eco-fash come a-knocking?  Hell, maybe they understand the dangers of capitalism in terms of their own poverty.  So what happens if they get a cushy job?  If you want to know, ask any of your older relatives who've ever told you that you're going to get conservative as you age.  So congrats, you spent a lot of time and emotional energy coddling some dipshit, fighting off all the people that they treated like garbage, and then it turns out they weren't even useful like in your realpolitik planning.  But what if they don't even leave?  What if they stay in your spaces spewing toxic ideas that you can no longer fight because you've spent so long convincing everyone who will listen that anyone who complains about that type of thing is a woke scold, a radlib?  The truth is, we have all been socialized to be individualistic, to not truly care about the suffering of others, because the weight of that suffering is unbearable.  And if we truly allowed ourselves to feel it, if we truly allowed ourselves to be open and caring for others, we could not possibly tolerate an economic system that requires that suffering to operate.  If you want to defeat capitalism, the first step is to undo that socialization and convince ourselves and one another to give a damn.  Thanks for watching my sweaty preachy video.

Hey, also, still working on the drawings for August, because holy shit, you guys are amazing, and I got over 20 new Doodle requests, which, wow, is really great for me, and I have rewarded that kindness by dragging my feet.  But in my defense, I did have a stomach flu this week and was really sick, and basically lost an entire day sleeping.  And that sucked for me, so oopsie daisies.  I believe it was the anarchist philosopher, Volan, who once said, be excellent to one another.  Also, I don't know if I pronounced his name correctly, because I've never heard it said out loud.
