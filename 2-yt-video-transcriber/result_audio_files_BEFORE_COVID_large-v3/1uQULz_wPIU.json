He revitalized American manufacturing as the head of our middle class task force.  He fought to make college more affordable.  He suited up for our cancer moonshot, giving hope to millions of Americans.  Joe's candid counsel has made me a better president.  He led our It's On Us campaign against campus sexual assault.  He championed landmark legislation to protect women from violence.  He led our efforts to combat gun violence.  He could not have been a more effective partner in the progress that we've made.  The best part is he's nowhere close to finish. ",

It's an idea that's stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator of time.  It gives hope to the most desperate people on earth.  It's about decency.  It's about giving no room or solace to hate.  We are seeing appeals to populism, nationalism, and xenophobia.  and the system dominated and rigged in favor of the powerful.  Everybody, everybody, everybody is entitled to be treated with dignity. ",

When Joe talks about hope and opportunity for our children, we hear the father who rode the rails home every night so he could be there to tuck his kids into bed.  When Joe sticks up for the little guy, we hear the young boy who used to stand in front of the mirror reciting Yeats, determined to vanquish debilitating stutter.  When Joe talks to Gold Star families who've lost a hero, we hear a kindred spirit, another father of an American veteran, somebody who's been forced to wander through the darkness himself and who knows who to lean on to find the light.  So that's Joe Biden, resilient, loyal, and a patriot. ",
