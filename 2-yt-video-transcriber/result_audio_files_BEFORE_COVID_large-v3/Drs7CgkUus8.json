And speaking of that, the Daily Warrior is reporting that Trump administration said no to flying a so-called homosexual flag on the US embassy flagpole.  Three American diplomats report that the Trump administration had denied their request to wave the gay flag during the month of June.  Since the State Department began rejecting all embassy requests to host a gay flag, some U.S.  diplomats have been finding ways to defy or at least get around the new policy.  So Trump said\u2014so this is gay month.  You know they're celebrating the gay month, right?  And Trump said\u2014 No, you're not going to put that flag up on the flagpole next to the American flag.  And so in some of these states, they're doing it anyway.  Here is... A flag.  Amazing.  And don't forget to like, follow, tweet, subscribe, and share the Jesse Lee Peterson Radio Show post.  We really appreciate it.  We are at war.  It is a spiritual battle for the soul of America.  And it's going to take all of us to do it. ",
