But this cop's attitude is absolutely treating the public like they're subhuman, pesky citizens, and he's some high and mighty know-it-all.  Disgusting behavior for this cop. ",

I'll take you to jail.  Really?  What crime?  See, I've always had a problem with cops.  As a cop, we were always told you can either chew them out and not write them, or you can write them and not chew them out.  But you can't do both.  If you want to trade giving them a ticket for a chew out, then you can probably get away with that.  Later on, you find out that if you let somebody go and they complain... You're going to be in the wrong for not writing them.  If they did something wrong, they'll validate a complaint on you.  So a lot of cops just be screw it.  If you give me any attitude that I think you're going to complain, I'm going to go ahead and write you.  Because if you write somebody and they complain, they kind of throw out the complaint saying, ah, you gave him a ticket.  He's just pissed. ",
