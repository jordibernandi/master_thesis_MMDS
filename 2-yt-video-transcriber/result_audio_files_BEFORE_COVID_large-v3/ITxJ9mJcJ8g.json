And I think what the crux of the matter here is we're talking about morality.  And I've made the statement many times that I'm more of a moral person now.  as an atheist than I ever was as a Christian.  And I believe that fully on primarily because I don't look at people in groups.  I don't look at one person as broken or bad and another person as good.  So I don't separate people based on what they believe.  or how they behave or whatever.  I just see all people as humans.  But one of the issues when we deal with morality as Christians and atheists is we get hung up.  We always go back to this issue of slavery because... God, when he was naming his top ten ideas about how people should live, the Ten Commandments, he nowhere mentioned slavery.  And it was more important for him that we didn't make graven images than that we didn't own people.  So, you know, we could always \u2013 we can parse out the different definitions of slavery, but we're still talking about an issue of morality.  And I think what you're caught \u2013 I think the \u2013 The trap that you're caught in is that you're a moral person, and yet your Bible has issues of immorality in it that have to be explained away or ignored.  I mean, slavery is just one.  Genocide is a whole other one.  And we could go down a long list of issues with morality in the Bible.  And you're stuck between trying to be a moral person and trying to defend a God.  that at times appears to be quite immoral.  And I understand your... I understand the conflict because I lived in that tension for a long, long time.  And I cannot tell you how liberating it is to be free from that. ",
