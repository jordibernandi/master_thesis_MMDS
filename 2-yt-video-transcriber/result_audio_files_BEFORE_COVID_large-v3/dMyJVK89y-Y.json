            "text": "They're now all rallying behind this baseless notion that Ukraine was responsible for interfering in the 2016 election in order to reverse engineer a justification for Trump's Ukraine investigation demand.  In other words, they know that Trump went to Ukrainian President Zelensky and tried to bribe him with military assistance that had already been allocated by Congress to open a probe into Biden.  They know that it was solely for his political gain, all under the pretense of corruption.  But they figure that if they can retroactively will into existence the idea that there was corruption, that there was election interference, then they can somehow justify Trump's extortion scheme.  They're literally rendering themselves complicit in Trump's criminal behavior.  Now this goes without saying, but no, Ukraine didn't interfere in the 2016 election.  This is a bad faith reference to the fact that the then-Ukrainian ambassador to the United States wrote an op-ed for The Hill wherein he criticized candidate Trump for saying he would consider recognizing Crimea as Russian territory.  That's what Cruz is referring to, an op-ed.  and a justified one at that, considering of course Ukraine would be critical of Trump recognizing Russia's claim to Ukraine's own sovereign territory in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion and annexation of that country.  Think about it.  If Mexico decided all of a sudden that they own Texas and the EU decided they'd recognize their claim, forget an op-ed, Trump would probably start a war over it.  And you mean to tell me that Ukraine writing an op-ed in the Hill was so outlandish as to be considered election interference by the GOP?  Give me a break.  So while I'm pretty sure that the fact that someone writing an op-ed doesn't quite qualify as the full-blown international conspiracy that Republicans would have you believe, the more important thing to realize is that of course Ukraine wasn't rooting for the guy being propped up by the country that had just declared war on them.  And beyond that, there's the fact that leaders from around the world criticized Trump prior to him taking office, not just Ukraine.  The French ambassador called him a vulture.  Ecuador's president called his discourse dumb.  Mexico's president said he arrived in the same way as the world's most dangerous dictators arrived.  Even Bibi Netanyahu said that he rejects Trump's remarks about Muslims.  In total, more than 60 foreign officials condemned Trump prior to him taking office.  So does Ted Cruz think Mexico also interfered in our election?  Ecuador?  Israel?  If any criticism whatsoever, including a simple op-ed, is grounds to call something election interference, then according to GOP logic, apparently half of the international community interfered too.  The fact is that this is in no way, on no planet equivalent to the top-down, large-scale interference campaign ordered by Putin and carried out by the Russians.  And look, clearly Republicans know this.  But this isn't about telling the truth, it's about going on national television and purposefully disseminating false information to the American people because that is the only defense Republicans have to try and save Trump.  To obfuscate the facts and sow doubt and peddle disinformation, all for the express purpose of manipulating the American people into thinking that an innocent country did something wrong, all to protect Donald Trump.  And not just an innocent country, a country that was the victim of an invasion by the same country that attacked us.  Not only are Republicans failing to hold Russia accountable, they're literally rewarding them by parroting their talking points.  The simple fact is that the Republican Party is no longer representing the American people.  They're representing Donald Trump.  They'll lie every time they come on TV, manipulate their own voters, prop up regimes that attack our own country, whatever it takes to make sure Trump isn't held accountable for his criminal behavior.  Of course, we can all see the truth.  Only now we know that people like Ted Cruz are complicit in Trump's crimes. ",
