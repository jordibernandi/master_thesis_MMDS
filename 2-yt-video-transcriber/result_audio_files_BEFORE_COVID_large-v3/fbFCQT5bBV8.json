What is your reaction to that? ",

They're about crimes and cover-ups, but also they are about the brave whistleblowers who come forward and the community of people in the general public, and especially journalists who say, enough, and we're not going to stop digging, and we're not going to stop asking tough questions, including of our bosses.  And it's incredibly moving to see that.  And it's why I finished writing a book like Catch and Kill and am still full of hope.  And it's really tough to organize in any context.  And it's tougher still when you're doing it and using it as a means to call out people who decide whether you get a raise or get frozen out.  And that's what they're doing.  There's a lot of brave journalists in that building, and they're really fed up.  And I'm inspired by it. ",

The book documents this series of secret payouts to bury sexual harassment allegations at that company.  One thing that I'm hearing is a lot of skepticism.  about that move that you know.  this is a company that continues to defy a lot of calls including inside the building for reform and leadership change and even outside investigation and that pledge to release people from their non-disclosure agreements had like a a ton of asterisks, including you have to come and ask permission, and then maybe we'll let you.  Bear in mind, this follows on weeks of them saying there were no such settlements.  Now the line is you have to go ask permission if you want to get out of the settlements that don't exist.  So there's a lot of confusion and apprehension, and I think that extends to the community inside the building.  These are reporters who are receiving this news.  They're pretty skeptical and tough.  They're asking hard questions.  That article in the Times today talks about how leadership is sort of dodging a lot of those questions, and I end up saying a lot.  I'm a reporter, not an activist, and it's not for me to say how that conversation should shake out, but I can say unequivocally I am really glad for people like Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes and all these people unionizing who aren't afraid to speak truth to power.
