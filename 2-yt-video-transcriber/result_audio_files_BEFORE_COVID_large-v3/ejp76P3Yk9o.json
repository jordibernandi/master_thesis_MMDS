            "text": "Well, Zachary Greenberg, who is not a student at UC Berkeley, but sort of floats around on the campus, assaulted Hayden Williams on the video that, you know, has gone viral all over the country.  without provocation and cold cocked him.  And, you know, Hayden has sustained injuries to his face as a result of that and his phone.  So after about 10 days, the police did arrest Hayden.  Mr.  Greenberg, and he was arraigned in court today on three felony charges of assault, battery, violent threats, and then also a destruction of the phone as a misdemeanor.  And he pled not guilty.  So that's what happened in court today.  There'll be an upcoming court date in about a month.  for a preliminary hearing, and it'll be interesting to see what his defense is, because it is very clearly him on the video, so he must have something else in mind in terms of his defense.  But he has a private attorney, not a public defender, and I've done some digging and I've learned a few other interesting facts about Mr.  Greenberg and his history with the court system. ",

            "text": "So Mr.  Greenberg, over the past couple of years, has had numerous incidents where he's filed restraining orders against his roommates in multiple group houses and then moved out of those group houses.  His roommates have have put in evidence that has been more believable and believed by the court that none of those incidents happened.  He's also had a restraining order filed against him by a former roommate, which was granted by court.  court and as a result of that restraining order he had to turn in his guns to the authorities.  he has filed several lawsuits against landlords for charges that were later dismissed by the court and found not to be valid and he has filed small claims.  claims against roommates again found not to be sustained for the most part.  and so You know, like almost a dozen lawsuits that I've uncovered that this man is involved in.  And interestingly, Tucker, this is a tactic actually that I've seen used in another case involving a Berkeley violent activist.  So you've had Yvette Falarka on your show.  And Falarka has filed false restraining orders against conservatives on the Berkeley campus.  You know, there's a case that I'm involved in.  that's now in the Court of Appeals on that where we defeated a false restraining order by her.  So I think this is one of the growing tactics of the left.  potentially is doing this.  And he does this with fee waivers.  So he isn't paying the fees, claiming that he's indigent.  And he has no visible means of support.  But his lawyer told the reporters today outside the courtroom that he is was on the campus studying in the library, but not as a Berkeley student, but studying somewhere else.  So there is a lot yet to be known about this guy, what motivated him, but clearly he has anger issues.  One of the people in the lawsuits described, you know, marijuana use, and certainly there's a gun, at least one gun involved in his possession.  And so a lot more to be asked about this guy and, you know, how he has private counsel and why is he pleading not guilty.  So, you know, we'll see what happens.  He's got a private lawyer. ",
