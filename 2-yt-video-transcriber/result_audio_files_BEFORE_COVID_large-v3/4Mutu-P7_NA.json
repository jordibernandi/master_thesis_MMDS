Mr.  Adams, in 1991, you pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information from Congress regarding your involvement in the Iran-Qortra affair.  for which you were later pardoned by President George H.W.  Bush.  I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful. ",

Thank you for your participation.  On February 8, 1982, you testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about U.S.  policy in El Salvador.  In that hearing, you dismissed as communist propaganda report about the massacre of El Mazote, in which more than 800 civilians, including children as young as two years old, were brutally murdered by US-trained troops.  During that massacre, some of those troops bragged about raping a 12-year-old girl before they killed them, girls before they killed them.  You later said that the US policy in El Salvador was a fabulous achievement.  Yes or no, do you still think so? ",
