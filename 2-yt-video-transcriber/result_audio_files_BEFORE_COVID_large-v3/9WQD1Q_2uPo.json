            "text": "Last week, Bettina wrote a newspaper article criticising the government for appointing a female national suicide officer.  She pointed out that there would be an outcry if a man was appointed head of a leading domestic violence prevention organisation.  This is just the latest move by a government determined to deny the fact that suicide is overwhelmingly a male problem, with six out of eight of our daily suicides taking the lives of men.  The recently released National Suicide Prevention Implementation Plan is proudly gender neutral.  failing to acknowledge that men not only dominate suicide statistics, but offering no special programs to address the unique causes of male suicide, which can differ dramatically from those of women who end their own lives.  And now Christine Morgan is to head up suicide prevention.  She's a mental health expert, but in fact, there's solid evidence that most male suicides are linked not to mental health problems, but to relationship breakup.  There's no way Morgan will promote this connection.  Bettina's article led to a heated interview with Merrick Watts on Radio 2GB as the announcer paraded his feminist sympathies and attempted to discredit her arguments.  Here's the interview. ",

He talked about veterans.  He talked about everything except the major group of suicides, which is ordinary blokes in their 30s and 40s.  That's the major group who are killing themselves, and our governments are determined to ignore that. ",

Over half of male suicides have no link to mental health problems.  With farmers, with rural areas, 78% there's no link to mental health problems.  And with older guys, 83% there's no mental health problem.  There are other issues involved here.  I've just made a YouTube video with a wonderful woman called Mary O'Brien.  She's actually a sort of rural consultant, but she's famous because she wrote an article a couple of years ago called Are You Bogged, Mate?  And it was about what's happening to men in the bush in rural areas, why they're killing themselves.  And she's outspoken about the fact that we're getting it wrong.  Our governments are getting it wrong.  The reasons men are killing, we know why men are killing themselves.  The major issue is linked to relationship breakup.  Over half of male suicides, according to our big suicide research organisation, are linked to relationship issues and all the other things that go with that.  One in 20 are associated with child custody issues.  One in 10 with pending legal problems.  And, of course, what happens if you have a relationship breakup?  You end up in court very often.  One in six related to money issues, which is exactly what happens to men when they get divorced and have to fight family court battles. ",

What we want is we want action, and we want the best person in that position, surely.  It should be based on merit.  And the idea that somebody who has got a background in mental health, that's only going to assist it, surely.  I mean, what if you get somebody who's... whose experience is in transport.  How's that going to help?  If you get a female whose background is in transport, what's that got to do with suicide prevention?  Just because they're a female? ",
