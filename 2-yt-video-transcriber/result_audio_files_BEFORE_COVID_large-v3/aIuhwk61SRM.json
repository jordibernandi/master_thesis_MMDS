            "text": "Hey, everyone.  Thanks for coming to pedophile... I mean, Epstein Island.  Uh, thank you.  Um, me and Chuck are really looking forward to our show.  Gosh, damn it, Nancy!  I'm not here with you!  Well, maybe you could have told me that before I packed my lacy underwear.  Ugh, I'm gonna throw up!  Now, the first rule of Pet, I mean, Epstein Island is you don't talk about Pet, I mean, Epstein Island, okay?  Ooh, what are we talking about?  Epstein Island.  Gosh, damn it, Nancy.  He said the first rule of Epstein Island is you don't talk about Epstein Island.  Jeez!  Well, excuse me, Chuck.  Do you guys have any questions before we get started?  Yeah, I got a question.  Is that the cops?  No, there's no cops on Peta... I mean, Epstein Island.  Oh, good.  They don't need to see what I'm about to do.  Hey, y'all got any knee pads up in here?  Yeah, we have a wide variety of knee pads.  Oh, good.  I'm gonna need me a pad each color.  Hi, do you guys check emails up here?  No, we don't check emails.  In fact, all emails are thrown into a volcano.  That's awesome.  Awesome.  Is there any other questions?  Yeah, I got a, um, I got a, I got a question.  Um, is, is, is there any, uh, age limit here?  No, there's no age limit here at Padme, I mean, Epstein Island.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  I, I, I like it.  I like it a lot.  Well, if that's all the questions, enjoy your stay at Padme Epstein Island.  Um, excuse me, but, um, can you direct me to the alcohol?  Hey, so when do we get to see some boobies?  I'm more into like the more petite boobs, you know?  You guys want to see some boobies?  No, not me.  I'm happily married.  Have you seen my wife?  Yeah, I want to see some boobies.  I want to see some big old boobies.  Do you have any tiny boobies?  Yeah, I'm happily married.  I don't got to see any boobies.  All right, guys, if you want to see some boobies, come with me.  I'll just hang out in my room.  I got to go call my wife.  Sucks to be you.  Hey, so, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  Sure, what's up?  Um, uh, first off, uh, uh, what is this that you have on your head here?  Well, I'm not only the president of Pet, I mean, Epstein Island, I'm also the mascot.  Oh, oh, that's wonderful, I love it, I love it.  Thank you, it puts my guests in a good mood.  Yeah, yeah, speaking of guests, um, would it be okay to invite, uh, family members, you know, like maybe my daughter?  Uh... You know, it's up to you, you know, whatever you want to do here.  Well, anything goes at, I mean, Epstein Island, you know.  Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Well, I just got off the phone with my wife.  She seems to be doing good.  Oh, suck it, boy.  Are you drunk already?  Yeah, I'm a little snarky, so what?  Gosh, damn it, Nancy.  Hey, Jeffrey, you want to play house?  Uh, no, no.  Ooh, I've been a bad girl.  You can delete all my emails.  Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and pass.  Hey, Nancy, I was thinking maybe we could go out to dinner tonight.  Come on, suck it.  Stop it already, okay?  What are you talking about, Nancy?  Stop what?  Stop hitting on me, okay?  I am not into you, Suck.  What are you talking about?  I'm not hitting on you.  Have you seen my wife?  Yes, Suck.  I've seen your wife.  What the hell is that supposed to mean?  Hey, Jeffrey, can I talk to you for a minute?  Yeah, let me just set this KY jelly down.  Hey, Nancy, look at this.  What, Suck?  Looks like Camel is putting the moves on Jeff.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Looks like we're going to be getting a show.  Ugh, that's gross!  So, what's on your mind, Kamala?  Well, I was wondering if I could put on some knee pads and give you a massage?  No, no, no.  I'm into women just a little bit younger than you.  Well, is there anything I can do to change your mind?  I'm trying to be president.  Yeah, I don't think so.  You're like a slightly better looking version of Maxine Waters, so there's really no hope for you.  Denied!  Hey, Jeffrey, look what's on the front page of every newspaper in America!  What is it, man?  It says that you're in a lot of trouble, and I'm an accomplice!  Oh, man, that's okay.  I'm, like, totally rich, and, uh, I know your wife.  Oh, yeah, that's right, my wife.  She, uh, kind of makes things disappear.  Hey, Nancy, I'm starting to get the feeling this isn't a vacation island.  God damn it!  Your feathers!  They're all in my face!  Well, excuse me, I was trying to get dressed up for a fancy dinner!  That's him, Suck!  You're screwing up all my makeup!  That's not makeup, that's cake frosting!  Screw you, Suck!  Hi, Jeffrey, what are you doing?  Nothing, just minding my own business.  I heard about what they wrote about you in the paper.  Yeah, it's gonna be okay, though.  It sucks.  you already wrote a suicide note.  Huh?  I cannot believe you're gonna try and do that in your jail cell.  What are you talking about?  Oh, Jeffrey, we're gonna miss you.  Anybody ever tell you you look like a drunk tulip?  You're just jealous, Suck.  I look fabulous.  Yeah, I'd look fabulous if I was drunk, too.  I was wondering if there was a playground around here somewhere.  Hey, Jeffrey, I've been here for 45 minutes and I'm already out of knee pads.  Hey, is that the cops?  Bill, settle down, man.  It ain't the cops.  I'm paranoid.  I've been doing some crazy things here.  You need to chill out, bro.  Looks like the Clintons and Epstein are up to no good.  I think you're right, Chuck.  Maybe we should tell them to pay us money to keep our mouths shut.  Yeah, that's a pretty good idea, Nancy.  Oh, thanks, Chuck.  So, Jeffrey, me and Nancy know what's going on.  Who knows?  He knows.  Did you call the cops?  No, I didn't call the cops.  If anybody asks, I was not at the playground, okay?  So what is it that you want, Chuck?  Give us money and we'll be quiet.  Give him all the money.  I can't go to.  How much are you gonna want?  Oh, I don't know.  How much are you worth?  So, what do you say, Chuck?  Well, I didn't know how much money to ask for.  Are you kidding me?  Chef is worth, like, a billion dollars.  We could be rich.  A billion dollars?  Go and get that money, Chuck.  So how much money do you want, Chuck?  Me and Nancy want $500 million.  Oh, no.  I feel my suicide note being written.  Well, are you gonna pay it or not?  Give me a minute to think about it, okay?  Hey, what's going on?  It's so sad about your suicide note, Jeffrey.  My name ain't Jeffrey.  My name's Bill Clinton.  I'm going to miss you, Jeffrey.  I'm not Jeffrey.  I'm Bill Clinton. ",
