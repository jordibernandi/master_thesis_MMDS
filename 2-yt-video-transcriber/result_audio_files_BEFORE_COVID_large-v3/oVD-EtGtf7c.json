They failed, but the Egyptians saw they were great fighters, and they employed them as proxy forces to protect the entryway into Egypt from Mesopotamia.  But what's interesting is that we're not technically in the land of the Philistines here.  We're east of it.  We're out in the desert.  And this brings us to, I think, an interesting point, that in those days you didn't have borders the way we do today with a line on the map and you're on this side and I'm on that side.  But land was much more about control.  If your army could reach out to it, you controlled it.  If there was an army on the other side, there might be an overlap of influence and power without an exact border between the two.  So we're not strictly in the land of the Philistines, but the Philistines' influence reaches out to here.  This is a time when there are no real borders in that sense, but rather influence and power.  Real borders only begin in the book of Joshua.  chapter 14 and beyond where the the borders of the tribes are delineated point by point location location.  what happens here is the philistines are out there grazing they need the water they take the wells ",
