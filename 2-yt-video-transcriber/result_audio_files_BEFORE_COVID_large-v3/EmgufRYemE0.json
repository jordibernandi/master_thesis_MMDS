            "text": "Hey everybody, what's going on?  I got another good one for you today.  I'm going to start this one off.  It's going to be a top five, but it's also going to be a little bit of a story time.  So last night I had to run to the grocery store, right?  And I've learned recently that I actually like going to the grocery store in the morning.  So if you're like a small business owner, you have time off in the morning, totally go first thing in the morning.  It'll change your life.  A grocery shopping like eight 30 in the morning, everything's stocked.  There's no workers in the way.  Everybody's chipper.  The sun's out.  It's just, it's a, it's a really good vibe whenever you go in the morning.  I hate grocery shopping, though.  I'm horrible at it.  It's one of the only things I honestly probably miss having my ex-wife around for was the grocery shop, and it was actually nice having her do that.  I just never get what I'm supposed to get.  Guys are bad at it, I think, unless you're like a chef or something, but I'm no chef.  So I'm at the store.  It's like 11.30 at night.  I only had to grab a couple things.  We had no drinks left in the house, so I had to go and grab some drinks and a couple other small things.  And I go up the checkout, and I use the self-checkout lane, right?  Which, I like the self-checkout lanes.  I don't know why.  I guess I'm a little OCD about my bagging.  I like to bag it a certain way, and it seems like when they do it, they just waste bags, and you end up coming home with a ton of these bags, and they're underneath my... My hole underneath in my sink is just a giant bag depot.  So... I like to do the self-checkout thing, and I don't know why, I just like to do my own thing and stay away from everybody.  So I go up, get in the self-checkout lane, I do my thing, I pay.  Now this is one of the ones with the conveyor belts where you scan your stuff, send it down the belt, and it all sits at the end for you to bag whenever you leave.  So I'm down there bagging my stuff.  Now the normal thing that you would do here is if you come up behind a person who's at the self-checkout lane, I'm hoping that you guys know this, you just wait, right?  Just wait a minute, let me bag my stuff, We'll get you out of the way in a second.  No big deal.  So I'm sitting there.  I just paid.  I'm starting to bag my stuff up.  I get one bag into my cart.  And next thing I know, who comes up behind me in line?  Single mom.  Single mom with a kid on her side, right?  The kid's in a dirty onesie.  The kid's face is all disheveled looking.  Looks like she hasn't wiped her off in days.  And she comes up, scans her card, turns the self-checkout thing on, and immediately... Immediately just scans a box of diapers and sends it down the conveyor belt and all my shit.  So next thing I know this box of diapers comes on just smashes all my stuff.  now It's funny because I had always said to myself I wonder what I would do if somebody did that I've never had anybody do it.  all the years I've been shopping at the this this branch or this this grocery store chain.  I have never had Anybody.  they always wait their turn wait until I'm done bagging scan their stuff and they get going.  and I always said I would start putting their stuff into my bag, but this time they didn't.  it was a giant box of diapers, so It comes down, it crushes all my stuff at the bottom, and she comes down and she goes, sorry.  No, you're not.  You're not sorry one bit.  You wouldn't have done it if you cared.  If you had any ounce of care in your body, you would have never even sent that thing down here.  I'm bagging my stuff up.  She pays.  She comes down.  She walks down.  She has to walk past me.  My cart's there and everything.  I have to move my cart and move out of her way to let her leave.  So I look at her and I said, you know, I've always wondered what I would do if somebody did what you just did.  Nobody's ever done it to me.  all the years I've been shopping here.  She goes, well, sorry about that.  But my baby, my baby needs her diaper changed.  And I'm like, I don't care.  And she looked at me.  She couldn't believe.  I said it to her.  I said, I don't care what your story is.  I don't care.  It's ignorant.  What you just did was ignorant.  You didn't need to do that.  And it got me thinking.  These single moms, they just don't care.  They have been so ingrained that they are so special and so important in this world that they just do not care enough that you had no diapers left for your child.  It's 11.30 at night and you had to drag your kid to the grocery store to buy a box of diapers and to piss somebody else's night off and get in their way, right?  So I started thinking, There's a ton of lists out there of why you shouldn't date a single mom, the financial side, the resources that you have, you know, putting all your time and money into their kids and they're never going to be your kid.  All that.  I get it.  I know all that stuff.  I've watched more than enough of those videos.  This is my top five list of things that I hate and I've always noticed about single moms.  But before we start, thank you again everybody who's subscribed to the channel.  I really appreciate everything, the growth and all that.  It's going crazy.  I love these comments.  Man, you guys are just amazing in the comment section.  It's so fun to watch everybody talk and help each other out.  And just the stories.  I love the stories.  I might even start asking you guys a question.  At the end of this video, I'll think of a good question to ask you.  And I want to hear your stories down below.  But... also want to say thank you to everybody who stopped by my eBay store.  the link is up in my description.  like I said I would never ask for free stuff for free money from you guys just to hand it out to me.  but I will ask you to go to my eBay store and maybe buy something cool that you like nothing wrong with that right and hit that like button.  hit that subscribe button if you're new here and wait till the end of this video.  I'm gonna give you guys a question and I want you to answer it in the comments down below.  let's get started on the list number one.  Their kids are always bad and have no respect.  No respect.  And it goes down the chain of the lower grade of a single mom it is, the worse it gets.  But even the ones that think that they're doing the right thing and they think that they got their stuff together, their kids are still a mess.  a single mother you know i talk about this all the time having kids is just like having dogs right.  you have to have that pack that pack mentality that leader mentality.  you just have to have it.  kids need that.  they need that structure.  they need to see that single moms don't have that.  moms alone don't have that.  most women don't have that.  some do a very very select few do and even they're not good at it.  and you know what guys we don't have the emotional side right when something bad happens to a kid we're not there to be able to.  you know We don't get all that.  We just tell them to move on.  But that's why you need both sides of the story.  You can't have too much of the soft.  You can't have too much of the hard.  These kids that are with their moms all the time are horrible.  they can't.  I know you get time without your kids ladies.  I know that you do.  what are you doing with it?  are you just sitting around the house?  because it seems like every time you leave the house to go do any little task you have to drag the kids with you and you have to just piss everybody else off.  it's around you.  how can you just let your kids scream at the top of their lungs in a retail establishment and not do something about it?  How can you just let that happen?  It is by far one of the most annoying things I have ever experienced in my life.  And I'll tell you what, it's typically white parents because I've seen the black parents.  They will.  I heard a black lady one time yell at her kid in the middle of a Marshall's.  I think it was.  And it was a Ross dress for less.  And out of nowhere, she just goes, boy, I will knock you the fuck out.  And then in the back of the store, way in the back, I heard some dude go, oh, it was hilarious.  I ain't never seen nothing like that.  They don't take no shit.  It's these white, the white parents are horrible, man.  They will let these kids just run around screaming and yelling, throwing stuff.  I'm in thrift stores a lot for my job, trying to source new stuff to sell.  And nonstop, always in the toy section, the kid section, there is always a little kid there just making a mess.  throwing stuff around, being loud as hell, and the parents are nowhere to be found.  They just leave and go.  I don't get it.  Always bad kids and they always have no respect for anybody.  And especially if they don't have respect for the mother, they're not going to have respect for anybody else, right?  But you never see that whenever it's a couple and there's a dad there.  Dad will put that kid in a place or the dad will take that kid out of the store, right?  The moms won't do that.  They're too self-centered on themselves and they want to keep shot.  They don't want to stop what they're doing because their kid's acting up.  And they don't get that.  their kid doesn't want to go Clothes shopping with them.  Your kid does not want to go to the store with you and watch you shop for clothes.  You got to find some time to do that on your own.  I know you can find that time.  number two any free time they get is there's.  it will never be yours.  so you trying to be with a single mother.  it would never ever work for the simple fact of every little moment they get without those kids that you think would be time that you guys could go do something.  it is time for her to go do something now.  you can come along And you can keep your mouth shut and you can watch her as she does stuff, but she has no interest in doing anything that you want to do.  This is not about you.  This is about her.  So any free time she gets will always be her free time.  She will not want to share that with you because let's face it guys, these single moms, they don't get a lot of free time, right?  They don't get a lot of time without these kids.  I get it.  It's hard.  I'm a single dad with my kids full time.  My ex-wife takes my kids, especially right now, maybe two nights a week for like four hours at a time, maybe.  So I get that it's hard, but I find ways to make it work, right?  I find I organize time for my kids to go other places.  I get people to help out with watching.  They go to school.  I go do all my shop.  I get so much done during the day that by the time they get home from school, I'm ready to take a nap.  so remember that their free time is their free time.  it will never.  you will never be a part of their free time.  they move way way too fast with relationships way too fast.  so if you're a good dude and you're out there thinking like you know what i could be a stepfather i could help out with these kids lives and help them.  and and you know and help them you know grow and and be a father figure to them you are gonna get caught up fast.  They are gonna sense all that.  They're gonna sense the fact that you are willing to take over their lives for them and help them with their lives, that they are going to want to put a ring on you faster than, they'll be talking about, hey, maybe you should meet the kids.  Maybe we should do something with the kids.  It's getting nice out.  We should get them all together.  You start talking to a single mom, I will guarantee you that it will move faster than lesbian relationships.  You know what the joke is about lesbian relationships, right?  First date's dinner, second date's moving truck.  Yeah, that's how single moms are.  Number four, they always have mediocre jobs.  you never find a single mom, very few, there's a few out there that will have really good jobs or they're actually making good money and everything, but the majority of single moms have very mediocre, meaningless jobs.  And you know the reason behind that, right?  because they don't want to put in the time.  It's just like the wage gap.  They want to talk about this phantom wage gap, right?  But they don't want to bitch about why women aren't overly shown in the sanitation department, right?  Or in the oil drilling or bridge building or skyscraper building, right?  They're not complaining about not being a part of all those jobs, but they definitely want those CEO jobs and everything.  So they're not willing to put in the time to make the real money because they want to go to their kid's soccer games and they want to be able to call off when their kid has the sniffles and they just want to stay home or whatever it may be.  They're not putting in the time it takes to make the money, so they always end up with these kind of just meaningless, mediocre jobs that they know at any moment.  they could just quit as soon as you come along and are ready to pay the bill.  So don't be a sucker.  Number five, why are they so horrible at driving?  so bad.  and and the moms are the ones that really get on me because i'll watch them in their cars and they'll be sitting there with the kids in the back seat and they'll be banging out text messages while they're driving.  they'll be doing their makeup.  have you ever watched a woman completely put her face on at a red light?  or while driving?  i've seen them driving going down the highway holding with their knee putting makeup on their face with a little mirror flip down staring at the mirror not even looking at the road just staring up at the mirror the whole time And I tell you what, speeding, every single time, I see somebody come flying up on me, almost.  I'd say a very high majority of the times that I have somebody either riding my ass, driving like an idiot, cutting me off, any of those types of things, I'll get up.  And I always go straight to old person.  I'm here in Pittsburgh in Western Pennsylvania.  We are like one of the old people capitals of the world.  But I always think it's gonna be an old person.  And 90% of the times, it's a woman.  And a lot of times it's a mom.  and they're in their little Kia SUVs, right?  And they're dipping and ducking through traffic and they're speeding up.  And why do they always wait till the last minute to break?  Why is it that, why is it never this nice gradual slow down stop, right?  It's always fly up and then just... and they're always wondering why.  their brakes are shot on their car right and they go to the mechanic.  my ex one time had her car to the point that i mean it was metal on metal on metal on metal as much metal as you could have on metal.  there was no brake pads left.  the rotors were damn near gone.  i mean every time she hit the brakes you could hear it through the phone how loud it was screaming.  now this is after we got when i was around.  i took care of all that stuff.  as soon as i would hear some squeaking on those brakes or i would drive it and feel that pedal though Changing those brakes out, right?  That's one of the number one things she regrets about me is I fixed everything.  When you have to start paying to get stuff fixed and you have to start paying to go to a mechanic and you have to start paying for a repairman to come out and see why the heater's not working in the house or the furnace or the dryer stopped drying.  You learn real quick what you walked away from.  Well guys, that's all I have for today.  I appreciate you stopping by and watching another one of my videos.  Hit that subscribe button, hit that like button, hit that eBay store up, see if you can find something cool that you like, help your boy out.  And I think the question for today that we're gonna have you answer down in the comments section is gonna be, Tell me about a funny first date that you had.  I know mine was, I showed up to meet a girl and she was wearing mom jeans and a Harley Davidson, a beat up Harley Davidson shirt, no makeup, hair in a ponytail and just looking like straight train wreck.  I'd like to hear about some of yours.  Let me know.  I love you guys.  I'll see you next time.  MGTOW. ",
