Sorry, I made a point in a previous video saying that you needed to hire an actual editor, and it looks like you've pretty much done that.  Either that, or you yourself have gotten good enough at editing to where you can do this.  Either way, I'm proud.  That said, while the over-excessive use of memes is incredibly entertaining, I do understand that it appeals to the lowest common denominator, whose attention span is as paper-thin as your personality.  That said, I noticed that you also had the Act Man in there, and I think the only reason you put him in there is because he made that viral video about you.  I guess this'll be my shout-out for Actman.  I'm not a huge fan of his channel, but it was through his channel that I discovered Damien.  So, as before, credit where credit's due.  A link to his channel will be in the description below.  Let him know I sent you.  Anywho, based on the examples that you've shown, it seems that your issue is with either androgynous males or people who don't have the stereotypical macho masculinity model.  At least, that's what I'm going to assume.  your issue is because of what you showed.  But maybe you'll show an actual argument instead of making fun of a bunch of pictures with no context. ",

It's one of the few ways that I can keep my mind engaged while also working out.  The only way that you can find me at a gym is if I had a pretty good audiobook to listen to.  And even then, I recently just got a work chair that actually allows me to pedal, so I'll be able to do that while I'm working to lose weight.  The point is, there are other methods of improving yourself besides just the gym.  The gym just happens to be the default option that everybody goes to because, well, that's just what people do.  And that seems to be what most of your issues stem from.  Whatever society's default is, you think that that's how things should be, and as soon as something deviates from the norm, that's when it becomes problematic.  For instance, for a very long time, society deemed video games as a waste of time and nothing more than a hobby.  The idea that people can actually make money doing that hobby is a very recent phenomenon.  As such, you rebel against the case of the video game hobbyist, just as you rebel against any man who happens to go outside of what our society deems a masculine man.  And here, the mere fact that somebody is deviating from what you consider the norm, going to the gym, that is also problematic to you. ",

I don't really see much merit in hiding one's feelings.  Like, what do you actually gain from that?  You manage to put yourself into a corner where nobody knows what you're actually thinking or feeling, and in the end, when you do that, what is gain?  What do you as a person gain out of that, aside from being able to put up a facade that isn't really the real you?  And when people become friends with that facade, what happens when it's time for that facade to come down?  At that point, you're gonna be really rolling the die on whether or not you keep any of these friends and relationships.

I do at least agree with the message that you gave at the end, that you definitely need to surround yourself with some of the people who do what you want to do, that way you can learn from them and become more successful.  It seems to be the one cogent point you've made throughout the entire video.  I've read a decent bit of books on this subject, like Sales EQ, Rich Dad Poor Dad, The 4-Hour Workweek, and a few others.  They all basically had the same message when it came to this, and that was that you have what's called your default friends.  These are the friends that you meet at work, and they're also the friends that you meet, say, on the subway train, or the people that you grew up with.  And then outside of your default friends, you have other friends that you might get for very specific reasons, like you might become friends with your mechanic, and later on down the road, if your car has issues again, you have somebody who's very useful to turn to.  And then you've got the people who you idolize, who you befriend so that they can teach you how to do what they did.  These varying levels and styles of friendships are some that were drilled into me when I read those books, and I think that's the message trying to get across here.  Since this is the one cogent point that you've made, I will offer a suggestion.  If you want to help people better themselves, then the best thing you can do is help them become the best versions of themselves that they could be.  Whereas, based on the videos of yours that I've seen, it seems like you want people to become the best versions of themselves that reflect you.  And I'm going to be completely honest, based on what I've seen of you, I do not want a bunch of you running around.  Anywho, I hope you guys enjoyed the video.  I know it's probably been an awkward transition as I've moved to content that isn't just atheism specifically.  I do have a couple of videos back on the atheism topic that I will be covering, like my first Paul and Morgan video and one called Evolutionists Say the Darnedest Things.  So expect those ones next week.  Anywho, like, comment, subscribe, share it with your friends, throw it at Damien if you want to.  The link to his stuff will be in the description down below, as well as Actman's.  Insert end of video tagline here. ",
