            "text": "So, Twitter has been legitimized as a space of public political debate by the appeals court of the United States.  Donald Trump has been told that he is not allowed to block people, and that doesn't just apply to him.  But we'll get to that in a minute.  As the New York Times reports, Trump can't block critics from his Twitter account.  appeals court rules.  President Trump has been violating the Constitution by blocking people from his Twitter account because they criticized or mocked him, a federal appeals court has ruled on Thursday.  The ruling could have broader implications for how the First Amendment applies to the social media era.  No kidding.  If Donald Trump can't block people from following him on Twitter and replying to him, obviously, how do you justify banning anyone from Facebook or Twitter or any of these other platforms?  You are saying that everyone has a right to use these platforms, which incidentally is what Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, believes, and you are violating their rights by banning them.  That's what this means.  So I find this very interesting, and I'm very, very curious to see where this goes from here.  Do I have to sue Twitter in order to get my account back?  Because it looks like that might actually work.  Because Mr.  Trump uses Twitter to conduct government business, he cannot exclude some Americans from reading his posts and engaging in conversations in the replies to them.  Because he does not like their views, a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled unanimously.  Writing for the panel, Judge Barrington D. Parker noted that the conduct of the government and its officials are subject today to a wide, open, robust debate that generates a level of passion and intensity the likes of which have rarely been seen.  The First Amendment prohibits an official who uses social media accounts for government purposes from excluding people from an otherwise open online dialogue because they say things the official disagrees with, he wrote.  This debate, as uncomfortable and as unpleasant as it frequently may be, is nonetheless a good thing.  In resolving this appeal, we remind the litigants and the public that if the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less.  I think that's fantastic.  I completely agree.  The best antidote to bad speech is more speech.  Good speech, in fact, to address what's been said.  That, to me, that's perfect.  The ruling will ensure that people aren't excluded from these forums simply because of their viewpoints and that public officials don't transform these digital spaces into echo chambers.  It will help ensure the integrity and vitality of digital spaces that are increasingly important to our democracy.  Oh dear, thinks the Twitter executive.  That sounds like we're in it for a bad way.  That sounds like this is going to have wide-reaching consequences.  It sounds like all of those people who have legitimate grievance against us are going to come back in force.  And I imagine that Trump is having this social media summit to which Tim Pool is going.  as a way of dealing with this new reality.  And what I love about this is all of the unbelievably petty stuff.  For example, some Ms.  Buckwalter said, to be fair, you didn't win the White House.  Russia won it for you.  And she was blocked.  Well, that's it.  If you can't accuse the president of being a Russian puppet on his own Twitter account, what can you do?  Land of the free my ass.  I've been blocked by Donald Trump on Twitter.  Well, OK, fine.  Be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.  In the defense of these annoying, whiny leftists, Trump's defense and his legal defense on this was pretty weak.  They suggested that his legal team argued, among other things, that he operated the account merely in a personal capacity, and so had the right to block whomever he wanted for any reason, including because those users annoyed him by criticizing or mocking him.  Come on, man.  You are the President of the United States, and you tweet policy updates and political statements all the time.  That's obviously not very convincing, which is presumably why Judge Parker wrote, We are not persuaded.  We conclude that the evidence of the official nature of the account is overwhelming.  We also conclude that once the President has chosen a platform and opened up its interactive space to millions of users and participants, he may not selectively exclude those with views he disagrees with.  Well... Okay, that's fine.  But then why should any other elected official be able to do the same thing?  What's the rationale?  Why should they have that right?  If Donald Trump doesn't have it, why do any of the others have it?  And that's where this is going.  Because it turns out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't allowed to do it either.  And it looks like she's getting sued for blocking people on the Twitter.  Almost immediately after Trump was told by the court that he couldn't block people, well, people were lining up to sue her too.  Former Democratic New York Assemblyman Dov Hickened... then announced plans to miss Ocasio-Cortez.  He had been blocked by the freshman representative on Twitter, told Fox News he was exploring where he would be filing his suit and if there would be any other plaintiffs.  In an email to Fox News, he said, most likely we'll be the only plaintiff, but we'll be citing other examples.  The claim is the same as the one against Trump.  She uses that account for political slash policy commentary, so to shut a citizen off from her statements is a problem, as well as blocking me from petitioning her or seeking her address.  Mr Hicken has encouraged other people blocked by her to come forward via Twitter, perhaps to find additional plaintiffs in the case.  He tweeted on Tuesday, if you or anyone you know has been blocked by AOC, please get in touch with me ASAP.  Oh dear.  Oh dear.  That's terrible.  She's going to have to unblock all those people who think she's an idiot, and who will tell her that?  How rough.  I can't believe that the pendulum swung back this quickly.  The reflected radiance of the God Emperor lands on those around him, and it burns.  And what's also great is that that chap isn't the only one.  Joey Salads is also suing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for blocking him on Twitter.  He has actually posted all of the information that he needs to, the paperwork to fill out... for the lawsuits, and he's posted to us saying, well, we'll see if the standards apply equally.  And that really is why this is necessary.  That's why it's a very, very good thing that conservatives suddenly leap on.  whatever a Democrat asshole has, you know, a politician has blocked them because they didn't like what they had to say.  That's, that's... why this needs to be done, to make sure that the standards are equal.  Because at the moment, it really does look like this is just a way of making sure that Donald Trump isn't really able to read his Twitter notifications, because it's just going to be thousands and thousands of angry verified checkmarks who want to tell him how evil he is.  Well, if he's got to have that, why don't the rest of them have to have that?  It's one rule for all, is it not?  And that's precisely where we are now.  So I'm very excited about the way this is going.  It should be interesting to see what happens, especially with the social media summit that's coming up.  I won't be present, obviously, because, honestly, because I'm travelling that day.  Travelling home, finally, thank God.  But I'm very confident that folks like Tim Pool will be able to make the case for the alternative media in a fair and justified way, and that he will do a very fine job.  So, thankfully, I actually do believe this is in good hands, and hopefully some very interesting things come out of it.  I guess we'll see, won't we? ",
