It's all about money, looks.  We're completely unconscious.  We have politicians who lie to us.  They're stealing our money and spending billions bombing innocent children.  People are starving all across the world.  This is absolutely normal for us to be on our iPhones and buying the latest shit while people are literally starving to death.  And this is absolutely a-okay honky-dory.  This is the system that you're taking your cues from.  That's the problem.  When you realize that that is not the system you want to be listening to, what you want to be listening to is your instincts as a man, your heart, what's in here, you will recognize that the system is bullshit.  and this is real.  And when you see a beautiful girl and you think, oh my God, I would like to meet her, the correct thing to do as a man who listens to his instincts and his heart is to walk over there and say, hey there, how's it going?  Don't worry, I'm not crazy.  Just in case she looks at you a little funny.  And say, you look, you're absolutely gorgeous and I absolutely had to meet you.  what's your name?  and if you do that in a genuine way coming from the heart because you are excited to come up to these girls you're talking.  i guarantee you three months from now your dating life will be so fucking crazy.  you'll probably be making dating videos.  you'll probably be a professional dating coach.  that's probably what will be happening.  that's how balling you'll be with the ladies if you could just grow the ball.  but can you do it though because most guys don't have the balls.
