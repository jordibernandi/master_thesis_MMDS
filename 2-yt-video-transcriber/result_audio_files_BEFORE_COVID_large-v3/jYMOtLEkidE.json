            "text": "Edmund Pettus was regarded as a hero in his native state and adopted hometown of Selma.  He wasn't even from Selma.  A lawyer, a statesman who served as a U.S.  senator.  But he was also a decorated Confederate general.  Are you ready for this?  And leader in the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.  That freaking bridge is named after the leader of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.  I am telling you right now, if we really love John Lewis, we really honor the work that John Lewis has done.  We sit and talk about Bloody Sunday.  We damn well ought to mark that territory.  And I'm telling you, we sit up here with a bridge named after a man who I just read the history.  And by the way, that bridge has been baptized with his blood.  He almost died on that bridge.  For what purpose?  To get the right to vote.  What better way in 2020 to honor John Lewis than take that fucking name, Edmund Pettus, off that bridge, who was a U.S.  senator, by the way, and replace it with Congressman John Lewis.  Now, I know y'all hear me.  And I know the other folk who hate me for bringing it up, I know y'all hate it, and you can hate, I don't care, you can hate until you hate out.  But there's more of us than there are of you. ",
