            "text": "10 days from now it's Christmas.  I was just wondering who of you will go to church when it's Christmas?  Oh, that's a lot.  Why?  Because it's the birthday of Christ, whatever.  What else?  Okay.  It's the birthday of Newton.  Go to the observatory.  I'll go off to a Christmas service because at Christmas, for me, I celebrate Christmas and the reason is best summarized in one line from John's Gospel.  And the light shines in the darkness, and darkness cannot overcome it.  Now, that the light shines in darkness, that seems to me a very interesting concept.  Obviously people will contest whether Christ is the light.  I believe Christ is the light.  But this idea that something good is inserted in a situation which is compromised, which is kind of dark.  That seems to me significant, but I think I actually like the second line of this saying, and the darkness cannot overcome.  And for me, Christmas is a celebration of kind of primordial nature of the good.  We discussed earlier this morning about the primacy of good and the place of evil, weakness of strength of evil.  I believe that good is primary.  It's primordial, in fact, so that evil is always distortion of the good.  and that the victory is there already, existence itself is good, and this existence, our existence itself, we celebrate.  And we start from there.  And that's also why I believe that it's goodness that overcomes the evil, and that the evil cannot always only be overcome within the moral frame, whether that's just war.  Better ask me why. ",
