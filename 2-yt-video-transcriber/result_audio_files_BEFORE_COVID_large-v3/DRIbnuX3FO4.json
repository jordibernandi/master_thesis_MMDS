And you, my young brothers and sisters, are filled with that illusion.  and I'm here tonight to bust your bubble and bring you into reality.  Everybody all right?  Can I borrow that microphone?  I don't want to lose what little of my voice is left.  Can you hear me alright?  Oh good, good.  Now, this is called black history.  Month is it?  It used to be called Negro history week.  You remember?  Of course you don't remember.  You're quite young.  It's okay.  Maybe you can put it back where it was.  I think it'll pick up.  Thank you.  Of course we've come a long way From Negro History Week to Black History Month.  we've really improved.  Or is this too another illusion?  Let us see.  How do we record history?  Is it true that when a child is conceived in its mother's womb we don't say the child is so many years and nine months old?  we start counting the history of that child not at conception but at birth when the umbilical cord is cut and it is breathing independently of its mother on its own, then we say life begins for Johnny or Mary, history begins for Johnny or Mary.  History begins not in darkness, but when that life has come out of darkness into the light of freedom, it then makes history.  If that is true with an individual, so is it also true with a nation.  We are 30 million people who have not made any history in 400 years.  Pardon me, sir?  What did you say?  30 million people? ",
