Jaguar Land Rover says it's extending a shutdown in production in April because of potential Brexit disruption.  Deutsche Bank is moving 400 billion euros of balance sheets assets to Frankfurt.  Two insurance giants are moving to the European Union.  AIG is moving to Luxembourg, Chubb's moving to France.  They say explicitly because of Brexit.  Panasonic and Sony are moving their headquarters to Amsterdam because of Brexit.  I can actually go on, but you take the point. ",

And right now, this morning, in Newcastle, there's a businesswoman going to work, she owns her own business, she employs 20 people, she pays tax, she's got her house on the line.  She is a typical businessperson in the United Kingdom, with great respect, not JLR or all the banks you just reeled off, but that is the core of British business.  And what they've got is uncertainty, they've got lack of stability, and they cannot predict where they are.  so what's the one thing they won't do is risk any more investment in their business till they know where they stand and then you can touch the bottom of the pool they're swimming in.  what is killing?  this is not brexit.  it is the uncertainty created by 650 people in the house of commons who are fundamentally as a political class letting down the united kingdom.
