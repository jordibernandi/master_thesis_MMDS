            "text": "Good evening.  I'm here with political refugee and victim of a vicious Nazi hate crime ring, Buddha.  Hello to you.  Indeed, Buddha rose to notoriety after being the unwilling subject of a terroristic propaganda campaign led by far-right, alt-right criminal mastermind Marcus McCheecherton.  We, in this program, are not at liberty to broadcast the grossly offensive communication in question, but we can assure you it features a man in a MAGA hat throwing a dog over a cliff into a pit trap full of Nazis.  And lolly.  So, Mr.  Buddha, how are you feeling after this rather harrowing ordeal?  Have the authorities deconditioned you from your hypnotized hatred of the Muslim community?  You what?  Jews?  Oh, I see.  When did you stop beating them?  What kind of gas?  Throw up?  I tried feeding them to a dingo, and it just urinated in my eye.  Cut that bit.  The devil?  Speaking of fascist genocide, Mr.  Buddha, I've just been informed that you and your entourage will be attending the International Conference on Men's Issues in Chicago August 16th, 17th, and 18th of this year.  Is this true?  My God, man!  Haven't you ever heard of optics?  I mean outside the context of a grimy wall of glass decanters full of whiskey and oats, or whatever you gutter snipes use to decorate your tins of moral depravity.  The fact that you choose to associate with such unbearable reprobates is despicable.  I expect your social resignation from the human race on my desk tomorrow morning.  From the dog race on my desk tomorrow morning.  Or you'll be seeing Hilda and Bertha from the Ethical Readjustment Committee.  Malato.  How dare you expose me to moral filth by transitive property?  Who can I call about this travesty?  How dare someone set me up like this?  You!  We will be having words, sir.  Words!  Heavy, palpable words.  Words with gravity.  Words you could use to lift and burn away underarm flab with.  Who are you? ",
