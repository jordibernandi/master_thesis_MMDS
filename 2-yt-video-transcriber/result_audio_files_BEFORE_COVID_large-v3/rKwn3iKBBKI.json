            "text": "So let's take a look and see.  what does Donald Trump experience once he leaves the White House.  Since he will not be there forever, as some have feared, what does he experience?  Now, I'm not going to say that.  So anyway, What will he experience once he leaves the White House?  Will we see the Justice card?  Will they make an appearance here?  Because the whole statute of limitations thing he's trying to meet.  So, let's see.  So, first we get the magician.  What will he experience once he leaves the White House?  Times for trickery.  Maybe he has the skills to move on.  We'll see.  The chariot, there is the moving on part.  The world completion.  Job is done.  King of Swords.  Okay, so after he leaves the White House, so far we're experiencing nothing bad.  I mean, we still have 12 cars to go, but right now, nothing bad.  The magician, there's the skills, the chariot moving on the world completion, and then Donald Trump.  So 10 of cups, happy home, happy life.  Four swords, time of rest.  The lovers.  That is a bond.  And then the Queen of Pentacles.  There's a woman in his life.  So everything's good right now.  Three of Pentacles.  This is your business.  Literally the Apprentice card.  There's the Hermit.  Searching for answers.  Isolation.  Withdrawal.  King of Pentacles.  that too sometimes donald trump and then the three of swords.  now we are in the realm of betrayal.  so it seems that with the business side of things like the home life seems to go a little bit better.  once we start to get into money with the pentacle cards then things start to get a little icky.  you have three of pentacles which is like i said literally the apprentice card And then you have who did it and what for.  Like now you have to go searching to see who is the snake in the grass or who is the mole or who is the this.  Or searching for who's about to testify and all these type of things.  That's assuming they bring any charges against you.  And then there you are again.  Now you are the man of money.  So now you have a different type of stature.  This is who you are to everybody else being the Gemini.  This is who you are business wise.  Then someone stabs you in the back.  Or used to have someone else in the back, but there's some betrayal of some sort.  And then the fool.  Which is also you.  So here you are indicated.  Here is the woman of money.  So probably Melania.  And then here you are as the businessman.  And then here you are as the one who is foolish.  Because now we have the fighting.  this is the five of wands.  is the bickering the arguing the back and forth right after the betrayal of course so that makes sense.  what is it about money?  and then the balancing starts.  in the midst of chaos you try to keep your footing.  things don't look good on some days.  things look a little brighter on some other days.  but so that's the basics.  The home life is okay.  The business life, eh.  Now, I'm not trying to goat the cards into telling me he's going to face justice.  This is why I'm like, I didn't ask why did or what is he going to face legally?  I just want to know what his life is going to be like.  What will he experience after he leaves the White House?  Freudian slip.  So, let's go a little further.  Do one last spread.  Because I just wanted to, you know, if you're going to say it, say it on your own.  I don't want the cars to say, well, here's the justice and here he's going to jail for 99 and a half years.  I mean, if he is fine, if he's not fine, I just want to know either way, one way or the other.  So, three of cups.  Celebration card.  Seven of wands.  Oh, this is offending.  So, we initially feel someone feels some sort of victory.  Now, I know we can jump to the conclusion that this is us because now he's gone.  Not really, because we don't know who was replacing him.  I mean, we just assume that since everything is so awful that a Democratic president is inevitable because there's going to be the change candidate.  But it's not guaranteed.  Hillary Clinton got more votes and she's still a loss.  So you see what guarantee gives us.  And then there is the 7 of Wands.  So somebody's defending outside of the celebration.  Three of Pentacles pops back up again.  That apprentice card.  So it's about business.  Business wise, he's going to have.  Oh, look what follows that.  Well, I won't jump the gun, but you can see it.  Five of Cups is the disappointment is the regret, sometimes sorrow.  Let's see, this person is at the bar.  They sort of drink their life away and... Yeah.  Some regret.  What follows that is the Justice card.  Around the business.  So.  I don't know if I manifested it myself, but there... Ooh.  Look what's around the regret, though.  The Ten of Swords.  So Ten of Swords is loss, defeat.  And then look what follows that.  The Fool.  And then look what follows that.  That's my Robin Muller card.  Remember to come have a seat.  And then what follows that is the Hangman.  The outlook has changed.  What follows that is the Ten of Wands.  That's your burden.  And being stuck.  That darn money.  I would have escaped if it wasn't for you meddling kids.  You have... This is where we start.  So, celebration.  Togetherness.  Not necessarily us.  I think this is him.  Togetherness.  He's alright.  He wasn't impeached.  He finished his term.  He might be the nominee.  Might.  So, you know, things are looking up for him.  And then the defending starts.  He's getting at it from all sides.  As you see, Republicans one by one are sort of dripping in as coming unglued at the seams and opposed to their incumbent.  It's that money.  The middle of June.  Be on the lookout for many people saying we have his financial records.  and here's what it says.  There's even a financial record in the darn thing where it looks like it is.  So we have the business.  The apprentice card.  Followed by regret.  And then justice steps in.  and causes a loss maybe not necessarily to him but someone in his orbit.  absolutely i always like this card.  it looks.  i mean he has lost everything.  this guy.  the swords are pierced in usually.  the dinosaurs don't actually always touch the victim but another person and this one it does.  But the sun makes it look as though the city's on fire, too.  So, like, everything's going to hell.  But it's just the way the sunset is.  Followed by the fool.  And then investigators.  And then being tied up.  Being bound.  This is self-sacrifice.  This is the card I always got when I asked if he was running for president.  And I got a no.  It's because he wants to... save his children is how it's going to look.  self-sacrifice followed by the burden.  yeah there's that.  what will he face when he leaves the white house?  his family life may be okay.  They'll feel as though life has restarted and they can go live again.  His business life, on the other hand, is not. ",
