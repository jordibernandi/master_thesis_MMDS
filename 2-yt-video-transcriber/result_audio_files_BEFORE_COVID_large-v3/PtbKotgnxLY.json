            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  So there's this amazing and disturbing video I'm going to play and talk about.  It's an exchange between Emma Vigilant from the Young Turks and a Trump supporter that took place in the last couple days of June.  Before I start and stop the clip while I marvel at the chart-topping dumbness, I want to implore the Democratic Party machinery, as well as each campaign, to be wise with their money and disciplined with their resources and calculated in their messaging.  Use this woman who spoke to Emma Vigeland as an example of who not to waste a single dollar on in efforts to target as a voter.  We must just accept that there are those in the Trump base who are too far gone to bring back into the fold of reasonable Americans who will vote to steer this country back onto track and into the future.  We must resign ourselves to the facts, to shed ourselves of childish wishful thinking, and deal with reality on reality's terms.  While clearly not all those who voted for Trump are beyond reaching, some people, are Trump cultists and cannot be swayed.  And to engineer an entire campaign's messaging strategy around the hope that they will be is a fool's errand. ",

Look, there is more to this interview and I would encourage you to check out the link to it in the description below.  But answer me this question.  What could possibly be said to sway this woman and men and women like her all over the country who are in it for Donald Trump?  What special sauce messaging strategy is it going to take to make these people come back to planet Earth?  I would argue that the answer is too elusive to be found in the short time between now and November 2020.  My advice is to appeal to rational Americans who were taken in by the outsider appeal of Donald Trump.  Those who fell for the con and lies from Donald Trump.  but who now realize that a better way forward for our country is not with him again, but with the stated policy objectives of the Democratic Party.
