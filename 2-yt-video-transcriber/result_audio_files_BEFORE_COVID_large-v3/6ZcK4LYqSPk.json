            "text": "Good morning everyone around the world.  Tina Spaulding, Trance Channel here for our daily Course in Miracles lesson.  Lesson number 37.  My holiness blesses the world.  This idea contains the first glimmerings of your true function in the world or why you are here.  Your purpose is to see the world through your own holiness.  Thus are you and the world blessed together.  No one loses.  Nothing is taken away from anyone.  Everyone gains through your holy vision.  It signifies the end of sacrifice because it offers everyone his full due.  And he is entitled to everything because it is his birthright as a son of God.  There is no other way in which the idea of sacrifice can be removed from the world's thinking.  Any other way of seeing will inevitably demand payment of someone or something.  As a result, the perceiver will lose.  Nor will he have any idea why he is losing.  Yet his wholeness restored to his awareness through your vision.  Yet is his wholeness restored to his awareness through your vision.  Your holiness blesses him by asking nothing of him.  Those who see themselves as whole make no demands.  Your holiness is the salvation of the world.  It lets you teach the world that it is one with you, not by preaching to it, not by telling it anything, but merely by your quiet recognition that in your holiness are all things blessed along with you.  Today's four longer practice periods, each involving three to five minutes of practice, begin with the repetition of the idea for today, followed by a minute or so of looking about you as you apply the idea to whatever you see.  My holiness blesses this chair.  My holiness blesses that window.  My holiness blesses this body.  Then close your eyes and apply the idea to any person who occurs to you using his name and saying, my holiness blesses you, Bob.  You may continue the practice period with your eyes closed.  You may open your eyes again and apply the idea for today to your outer world if you so desire.  You may alternate between applying the idea to what you see around you and to those who are in your thoughts or you may use any combination of these two phases of application that you prefer.  The practice period should conclude with a repetition of the day's idea with your eyes closed and another following immediately with your eyes open.  The shorter exercises consist of repeating the idea as often as you can.  It is particularly helpful to apply it silently to anyone you meet, using his name as you do so.  It is essential to use the idea.  if anyone seems to cause an adverse reaction in you.  Offer him the blessing of your holiness immediately that you may learn to keep it in your own awareness.  Lesson 37.  My holiness blesses the world.  Let's see what Jesus has to say.  You are blessed beings indeed.  I am that one that you know as Jesus.  And this is what you experienced about my last incarnation on this plane.  My holiness blessed the world and those who met me once I had awoken truly and completely, once I had become an enlightened being, were blessed in my presence.  And it was not a blessing of arrogance as the ego would do it.  It is just a frequency that the enlightened master teacher holds that emanates from them because they do not have any blocks preventing the extension of their powerful connection to Source.  It is not an individuated energy.  It is coming through.  It is coming from the Divine Mind through the unobstructed consciousness of the Master, the Enlightened Teacher.  And it extends to everyone and everything and therefore is most powerful in its creative abilities and will cause spontaneous miracles to happen.  The clarification of the mind is so important when you understand that whatever comes through you is going to be magnified by what is in you and that is why those of you with low frequencies and ego driven consciousnesses are not given access to tremendous powers because they would be magnified by the ego and you will see this at play in many.
