And when I'm doing research for my videos, I've got a couple of things that are absolutely essential to qualify the quality of the research I'm doing.  And these things are as follows.  Number one, the person absolutely must be standing in a public park at night.  Point two, they absolutely have to be wearing a hoodie with the hood up and the strings pulled tightly.  And finally, and probably most importantly, to make sure that what this person is saying is 100% valid and factual, they have to be drinking a can of beer.  Perfect.  Hello everybody, welcome to another episode of Playing a Blinder with me, the Creaky Blinder.  Now today, we're going to be taking a look at a channel I stumbled across this morning called Rocket Push Off Air.  And like every good flat earther, his channel is filled with... flat earth videos oddly enough.  but he's also a 911 denier and he thinks chemtrails are real.  but the big difference between rockets push off air and everyone else is if you google conspiracy theory click on the first website you see you get this.  so let's have a look and see what he's got to say for himself him and his can of beer.

Although a solar day is 24 hours, not every day is 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night.  Daytime is shorter in winter than it is in summer.  It's because the Earth's imaginary axis isn't straight up and down.  It's tilted at 23.5 degrees.  Now, as the Earth moves around the sun during the year, the northern half of the Earth is tilted towards the sun in the summer, making daytime longer than night.  In winter, this reverses.  The Earth tilts away from the sun and nighttime becomes longer.  in the spring and fall the tilt is neither toward or away from the sun but somewhere in between is that it?  are you going to offer an alternative explanation or just be like every other flat earther i come across shout and scream that we are wrong and you are right but you can't explain why you're right.  plus the position of the Sun in the sky is always going to be the same and the reason it isn't always the same is because we live on a globe and the Sun isn't actually stationary in the solar system anyway.  it's actually in orbit around every body that's also in orbit with it.  beyond this the Sun is also moving around the center of the Milky Way along with our entire solar system and one complete orbit takes about 230 million years.

So each day of the year, the Sun is at a different position in the sky.  because of that orbit.
