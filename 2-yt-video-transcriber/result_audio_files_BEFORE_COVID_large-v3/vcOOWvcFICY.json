And the idea that millennials are struggling due to standard consumption is completely wrong and frankly insulting.  Yes, people should examine their daily spending habits.  But the real problem is that the economy isn't working right.  In addition to this, millennials entered the workforce during the worst recession since the Great Depression, which has permanently lowered our wages.  So can we stop saying millennials are poor because we buy luxury items like coffee and fruit? ",

            "text": "For people working to pay off their student debt, the average monthly payment is nearly $400, with many having to pay a lot more.  How can someone generate savings when a huge chunk of their paychecks is going to loan repayment?  That is something no generation before ours has really had to deal with.  We also have absurdly high housing prices in cities, obscene health care costs, and sky-high costs of prescription meds, all at a time where the cost of living in our society keeps increasing.  And if you're at or near the minimum wage, even before loan repayment, it can't even keep up.  In zero of the 50 states can a young family with even one child get by on the minimum wage.  So it's no wonder nearly 80% of workers and an even higher percent of millennials live paycheck to paycheck.  Fortunately, we have a handful of policies to address the actual issue, and not anything as patronizing as, don't buy coffee or eat avocado toast.  The Raise the Wage Act would boost the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, fully restoring the minimum wage's loss in value over the last 50 years.  And that floor would rise automatically to keep pace with the median wage.  College for All would make all public universities tuition-free and reduce interest on our student loans.  Medicare for All would lower medical costs for the average person and ensure no one gets trapped in medical debt ever again.  Rather than scolding millennials, wealthy TV personalities might consider instead helping to advocate for legislation that will help fix our society. ",
