            "text": "Hey folks, Matthew coming at you.  I guess your Raw Report, TNFM Raw Report, if you will, 22 July 2019.  As you can tell, I've got the bags under my eyes answering emails.  I want to thank each and every one of you, whom for which joined the live stream.  last night, uh, big shout out to Matt Couch, I noticed he went live as well, gave me a, uh, shout out, appreciate that, uh, my friend, but, uh, reasoning, I'm doing this video for you now, just shooting it, basically, on YouTube, but, uh, folks, I've got some breaking news, I mean, I've been getting emails, uh, I've got it on the website, uh, but it, it's going around, I saw, um, In fact, I had somebody comment on the live stream earlier referencing this.  Then, miraculously, after the live stream, checked my emails.  I had some information sent to me.  Who knows, folks, but it's going around.  Lions Republic Channel.  Also, too, covered it.  So here we go.  I've got it up on the screen here in front of me.  I've got my little mouse bear with me.  Let me read it.  Let me just get right to it and read it to you.  I'm looking into it.  Like I said, I haven't vetted this 100%, but it's astounding.  And it goes a little something like this.  Okay.  Jeffrey Epstein caught sharing an FAA, meaning aircraft, tail number with a U.S.  military reconnaissance slash attack plane, folks, that was being used for covert operations in Columbia.  The same aircraft, I guess, back dating to 2010-11.  If you're familiar at all, DynCorp is... the company being referenced.  Let me continue to read here.  By U.S.  state-funded mercenary company called DynCorp, D-Y-N-C-O-R-P, International.  At the time, DynCorp that was caught trafficking children, the headline was on Huffington Post and some other outlets back in 2011.  The same DynCorp caught for trafficking, let me repeat that again, in Colombia.  It means that Epstein's, listen to this, Epstein's helicopter would have been able to bypass border security checkpoints and elude law enforcement.  There is an extremely high likelihood that Epstein's illegal children or child trafficking... was supported and funded.  They're claiming, none of this I have vetted 100%, so I want to repeat that.  They're claiming in this headline that I have on the website for all of you to check out under truthnotfictionmatters.com, but they're making the parallel that his aircraft got eluded.  Law enforcement Customs, you name it, had been used and also funded, meaning child trafficking, by the U.S.  government, according to documents filed in the U.S.  Federal Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, in 2008, folks.  Epstein shared the tail number of his Bell Long Ranger 203 Lima, LLC, helicopter, tail number November 474 Alpha Whiskey, with a U.S.  State Department OV-10D Delta Bronco, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, more have you.  Registration database, Epstein's Bell helicopter and Bronco were both owned by U.S.  State Department and contracted to the private military company Dynacor.  Dynacor International.  Both used the same identification number.  Other headline you might want to check out that I've got.  It's pretty revealing as well.  Former Mexican president allowed the CIA to operate... in Mexico, meaning under the Obama administration, the headline reads.  There's also a story, Larry, um, Serwinski, I believe, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that exactly right, but he called himself Captain Big Dog on Instagram.  That's meaning Epstein's, um, pilot that apparently worked for him for years, that was flying these aircraft, or aircrafts, multiple aircraft, helicopter, 550 Learjet by Gulfstream, and maybe the L-Express even.  But the headline I have on the website, pilots deleted.  Instagram sheds light.  on jet-setting Epstein's travels.  Then you go to the other bombshell bits of information off of that headline, or it's kind of like a forum.  You know, you be the judge.  I mean, you know, it almost looks like a, kind of looks like an HN.  article, if you will, but I can't make height or hair of it.  I've forwarded this same information to a couple of people, but folks, I got to tell you, if there's any truth to this, I mean, just imagine if this is Anyway, shape or form, like I said, it's already been covered by a couple of other YouTube channels like Lion Republic.  And I even had an individual, thanks for that, by the way, leaving a comment.  Folks, there's no telling how deep this Epstein case is going to go and what it's going to reveal.  But that is a bombshell.  if any of this comes to fruition and if it's true that Epstein's aircraft could have been possibly used with a government-funded company in sharing tail numbers with government aircraft.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Well, Patriots, stand tall together for the anthem.  Keep fighting.  Hold the line.  This is Matthew.  Till next time with, I'm sure, more to come.  God bless you all.  Again, thank you for joining me on the live stream.  Matthew signing off for now.  Thank you. ",
