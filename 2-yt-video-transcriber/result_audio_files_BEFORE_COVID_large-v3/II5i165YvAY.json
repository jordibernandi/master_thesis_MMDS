            "text": "See, Lyndon Johnson, he can always raise an argument about law and order because he never talked about justice.  But black people fall for that same argument, and they go around talking about lawbreakers.  We did not make the laws in this country.  We are neither morally nor legally confined to those laws.  Those laws that keep them up keep us down.  You've got to begin to understand that.  For 400 years, he taught you white nationalism, and you lapped it up.  You taught it to your children.  You had your children thinking that everything black was bad.  Black cows don't give good milk.  Black hens don't lay eggs.  Black for funerals, white for weddings.  That's white nationalism.  Santa Claus.  A white honky who slides down a black chimney and comes out white.  We can't equate progress with concessions.  We can no longer make that mistake.  You see, when they gave us that nigga astronaut, you say we were making progress, but I told you they were gonna lose him in space.  He didn't get that far.  You put Adam Clayton Powell in office and you couldn't keep him.  What you think they're gonna do with Thurgood Marshall when they get tired of him?  They gave you Walter Washington of Washington,  D.C.,  and you say we were making progress.  That's not progress.  See, it's no in-between.  You're either free or you're a slave.  There's no such thing as second-class citizenship.  That's like telling me you can be a little bit pregnant.  The only politics in this country that's relevant to black people today is the politics of revolution.  None other.  The only thing that's going to free Huey is gunpowder.  Black powder.  When black people become serious about the revolutionary struggle that they are caught up in, whether they recognize it or not, when they begin to go down and knock off people who are oppressing them, and began to render these people impotent.  That's when the revolutionary struggle unfolds.  Not until we are fighting enemies of the people.  They tell you your problem is unemployment.  Well, I got a program that can employ every black person in this country overnight.  We're here to celebrate Brother Huey P. Newton's birthday.  We're not here to celebrate it as Huey Newton the individual, but as Huey Newton part and parcel of black people wherever we are on the world today.  Today.  Today.  And so in talking about Brother Huey Newton tonight, we have to talk about the struggle of black people, not only in the United States, but in the world today, and how he becomes part and parcel of that struggle, how we move on so that our people will survive America.  Now why is it necessary for us to talk about the survival of our people?  Many of us feel, many of our generation feel, that they're getting ready to commit genocide against us.  Now, many people say that's a horrible thing to say about anybody.  But if it is a horrible thing to say, then we should do as Brother Malcolm says, we should examine history.  The birth of this nation was conceived in the genocide of the red man.  Genocide of the red man.  Of the red man.  In order for this country to come about, the hunky had to completely exterminate the red man, and he did it.  And he did it.  He did it.  And he did it where he does not even feel sorry, but he romanticizes it by putting it on television with cowboy and Indians.  Cowboy and Indian.  If you do not think he's capable of committing genocide against us, check out what he's doing to our brothers in Vietnam!  Check out what he's doing in Vietnam!  We must develop an undying love as is personified in Brother Huey P. Newton.  If we do not do that, we will be wiped out.  Our slogan will become, first our people, then, and only then, me and you as individuals.  Our people first.  Our people first.  The concept of a black man is one who recognizes his cultural, his historical, and the roots of his great ancestors who were the greatest warriors on the face of this earth.  Africans.  Africans.  Africans.  Many of our people's mind have been whitewashed.  If a negro comes up to you and you turn your back on him, he's got to run to the honky.  We're going to take time and patience with our people because they're ours.  They're ours.  All of the Uncle Toms, we're gonna sit down and we're gonna talk.  And when they slap, we're gonna bow.  And when they slap, we're gonna bow.  And we're gonna try to bring them home.  And if they don't come home, we go off them.  That's all.  We have to recognize who our major enemy is.  The major enemy is not your brother, flesh of your flesh, and blood of your blood.  The major enemy is the hunky and his institutions of racism.  That's the major enemy.  That is the major enemy.  A lot of people in the bourgeoisie tell me they don't like Rap Brown when he says, I'm gonna burn the country down.  But every time Rap Brown says, I'm gonna burn the country down, they get a poverty program.  They get a poverty program.  a lot of people say to me we don't like the black panthers for self-defense walking around with guns.  i tell you now if the hunkies in san francisco take off the fighters who happen to represent the black patterns for self-defense ain't nobody in this community prepared to fight right now?  everybody gets off And that's what we have to understand today.  So that everything goes out the window, we talk about survival.  That's all.  They can cut all that junk.  about poverty program, education, housing, welfare.  We talking about survival and brothers and sisters, we gonna survive America.  We gonna survive America.  We gonna survive America.  We need each other.  We have to have each other for our survival.  We have to have each other from the revolutionary to the conservative.  Our black united front is what we're about.  Our black united front is what we're about.  I want to read a statement that Brother Huey P. Newton wrote yesterday when I saw him in jail.  He says, as the racist police escalate the war in our communities against black people, we reserve the right to self-defense and maximum retaliation.  Understand this concept!  Understand this concept!  When they offed brother Malcolm, we did nothing!  If they off Brother Huey, we got to retaliate.  We got to retaliate.  We must retaliate.  We must fight for our humanity.  It is our humanity that is at stake.  All we say, Brother Huey will be set free or else. ",
