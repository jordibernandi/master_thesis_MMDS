            "text": "Jeff James Nugent, otherwise known as Jim Jefferies, is an Australian stand-up comedian who currently has his own show, the imaginatively named The Jim Jefferies Show on Comedy Central.  He's an Aussie boy made good in the US, so some might think that I should feel some provincial pride, but alas, I can't muster any.  You see, the first time I heard Jim Jefferies' stand-up was more than a decade ago, and I wasn't particularly impressed because I wasn't 20 years old and telling stories about how I got drunk once and did something stupid, which is what three-quarters of a Jim Jefferies set is.  Or at least it used to be.  Admittedly, I haven't watched anything of his for years.  And I don't have anything against swear words.  I use a few myself.  But I think for a stand-up comedian, Jefferies is overly reliant on using them.  he often inserts the c word into his routines which apparently american audiences find funny because there is more of a taboo around that word in the u s than there is in say australia and the u k. and if you haven't figured it out yet the c word refers to cunt you dumb cunts.  But hey, I get it, comedy is subjective.  Apparently some people think Amy Schumer is funny.  But whatever your preferences, there's no denying Jim has been very successful in attracting an audience.  But whether you like his comedy or not, Jeff Nugent has now discredited himself with an unbelievably dishonest representation of Avi Yemeni on an episode of The Jim Jefferies Show.  Who's Avi Yemeni?  He's an Australian YouTuber, he's been on The Outsiders, and he does these on-the-street type interviews which are often funny.  Now, I've got to be honest, I haven't watched much of Arvi's stuff, so don't take this as some kind of endorsement, but from what I've seen, I do think he's a straight shooter, which is more than you can say for Jeffries.  Anyway, I'm just going to play the clip from Arvi's channel to show you how he was misrepresented by Jeffries. ",

One, there'll be no neo-Nazi or Nazi sympathisers on the same segment because I don't want to be aligned to them and I don't want to give them any legitimacy or anything like that.  Common sense.  The second one was that they don't cut my answers from one question and put it to another.  Now, to my horror, but not my surprise, they did exactly both.  Both those things.  But they went even further.  They connected me to the Christchurch killer, to the terrorist. ",
