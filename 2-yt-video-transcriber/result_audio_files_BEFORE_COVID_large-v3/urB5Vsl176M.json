Um, I think two things I would point to is one, if you've managed to catch his two hour CPAC speech, um, he was openly rambling.  it just didn't make sense.  It sounded like the wild sort of gyrations and meandering sort of thought disorder of someone who really has something cognitively wrong with them.  And I remember when I first started suggesting that he was unfit because of his severe personality disorder, his malignant narcissism, which is the personality disorder that's shared by most murderous dictators.  I said, well, it's not like he's openly flagrantly thought disordered.  It's really more this severe personality disorder.  But, of course, if he were openly schizophrenic or openly thought disorder, well, then people would think that they could remove him under the 25th Amendment.  But anything short of that, they wouldn't even.  And now, actually, we are seeing a flagrant thought disorder in the form of this gross cognitive deterioration.  And still people are normalizing it.  The most recent example, of course, that Colbert was joking about last night was this.  Tim Apple comment that seems innocuous and funny, but it's actually quite revealing.  He's done this many times before, called people by the wrong names.  You know, in the fires of California, he said the fires were in Pleasure, California, not Paradise, California.  He's mixed up, done malpropisms with people's names about a dozen different times.  So the thing about this Tim Apple thing is it's not actually funny.  It's actually revealing of someone whose cognitive slippage is getting worse by the day and who's showing it more flagrantly every single day.  And people are so entranced with the dear leader that he could literally be a babbling idiot.  And then everyone will just normalize it. ",

As I said last time I was on the show, if you look at videotapes of him in the 1980s, he's quite articulate.  He's got a rich vocabulary.  His thought is sophisticated.  He speaks in polished paragraphs.  Now he can't complete a sentence without derailing into some kind of irrelevancy.  He really has trouble finding words.  His vocabulary is very thin.  He overuses superlatives, which is one of the things we see with people who have dementia.  Everything's tremendous or, you know, a shame or, you know, because that just sort of covers a wide multitude of things.  So we're seeing a gross deterioration from his own baseline.

I remember there was that one visual of him not being able to find the car and When he got off the plane he was sort of wandering around the tarmac and I think that was around five o'clock.  People were saying this looks like my demented uncle, you know sundowning.  We have a lot of examples of that where he seems to be disoriented, you know on stage He doesn't know where he is.

It doesn't measure these more subtle signs of cognitive decline.  So if you think of a rock rolling downhill, it only goes one way.  It only goes down.  But if it's halfway down the hill, it's not going to be sensitive \u2013 the Montreal test is not sensitive enough to catch that level of deterioration.  After all, this is someone with an Ivy League education.  So his fund of vocabulary, even if he loses 70 percent of his words \u2013 He still has more words than, say, someone with low average intelligence.  You know, if you look at the items on the Montreal cognitive assessment test, there are things like, can you identify a camel?  Can you identify a lion?  Can you say three numbers backwards?  These are the kind of things that if can you draw a clock?  So these are sort of things that are very, very rudimentary.  So you could have someone who's in an advanced stage of cognitive decline.  but who hasn't gotten so demented that they need to be institutionalized.  that would still pass the Montreal, especially if they started out with a high level of intelligence to begin with.  As I said, if you look at the tapes of him, people say, no, we haven't examined him, but we do have him on videotape speaking and behaving, so we have observed behavior.  If you look at the way he behaved and spoke in the 80s, he looks like someone who has two standard deviations cognitively ahead of he is right now. ",

            "text": "Well, just to take a step back, so the Goldwater rule really sprung from a lawsuit in 1964 when Barry Goldwater was running for president.  And a magazine, Fact magazine, which is now defunct, did a survey of psychiatrists as to whether he was mentally stable.  And this is in the area of Freudian psychiatry.  Uh, and so many of the psychiatrists said he wasn't, but the explanations they gave is that he had an unresolved Oedipus complex.  He'd been scarred by his potty training.  He was a latent homosexual, very speculative kinds of ideas.  And so I actually interviewed the last living member of the ethics committee from that era and he said, look, we didn't want people making irresponsible claims about public figures that weren't evidence based.  And that was why they put that rule in.  Also, they didn't want to make the profession look foolish or leave it open to lawsuits.  But then in the 1980s, we switched to a different diagnostic system, the DSM system, which is based on observable behaviors.  All of our diagnostic criteria are based on observable behaviors.  Well, we can observe Donald Trump's behavior.  We can observe him.  We observe him on TV.  We've all observed him on TV for hundreds of hours.  We observe his social media postings.  And also we We have what we call in psychiatry informants, people who have worked in the White House, who have written memoirs or have given interviews describing their observation of his behavior.  There was a hashtag 25th Amendment inside joke going on within the White House itself of his own aides making kind of slap your forehead sort of observations about the things that he would do.  that seemed so grossly disordered.  So it's not just an act.  The people who are closest to him are even more alarmed.  Because they do see more close up how disordered his behavior, his personality and his thinking truly is.  So what's important to understand is that the rule was put into place for good reason.  People shouldn't make irresponsible public statements.  But it wasn't intended to be an overall gag order.  And it's not saying that we can't make intelligent inferences about someone's behavior if we can observe their behavior and get information from other people who are observing their behavior.  So all of these comments that we're making are based on things that we can see with our own eyes and that people who are up close to him can see with their own eyes. ",

Not only could he shoot someone on Fifth Avenue, he could commit mass murder on Fifth Avenue and they would not remove him.  This has really become a fascist party.  who will unite behind the leader no matter how evil, no matter how dishonest, no matter how destructive, no matter how immoral his behavior.  And so I think I disagree with Nancy Pelosi in the sense that I think it's actually their constitutional duty to impeach him, given that he is not only committed.  You know, actually, if you read the Constitution, we always talk about high crimes and misdemeanors.  I'd like to point out that the Constitution, that's not exactly what it says.  It says that a president should be removed for treason, corruption, High crimes or misdemeanors.  High crimes and misdemeanors are the lowest level offenses for which you would impeach someone.  Treason and corruption are the highest level offenses.  And there is absolutely no doubt that this president has committed treason and that he is the most thoroughly corrupt politician perhaps in the history of our nation.  So he meets all four criteria.  But most importantly, he meets the more serious criteria.  When you have a traitor in the White House, that is an emergency.  And I would argue it is the constitutional duty of the Congress to impeach him, whether it's politically popular or not.  So I happen to strongly disagree with Nancy Pelosi about that.  But I do understand why she's saying it, because practically speaking, the 2020 election is the only way that we will remove him from office. ",
