            "text": "Hello and welcome to Southern Perspectives.  and remember what you do is your own business.  Well I promised you today that the envelope contents exactly what was written in the envelopes would be revealed today.  So it's been a long time since I talked to TRBR but I was finally able to talk to him.  He contacted me.  And he did tell me after this he was going to go into wilderness survival mode and get off the grid for a while.  So everything that he's told me so far has been pretty spot on.  So he told me that he found out what was written in the envelopes and what got the jaw-dropping response from all of those people that got envelopes.  And I'm not going to waste any time beating around the bush.  I'm going to tell you what was written in the envelopes.  And I wrote it down so that I wouldn't forget when he told me.  But exactly what was written in the envelopes.  And it was handwritten by Donald J. Trump himself.  William Barr.  John Durham.  It's over.  That's what was in the envelopes.  And, of course, Jeff Sessions resigned.  He appointed William Barr.  William Barr appointed John Durham to investigate the dirty dossier.  And right now, of course, Epstein is facing conviction for his sex crimes and sex trafficking.  Bill Clinton's involved in that.  John Durham is investigating Hillary's email server again.  William Barr is on a mission.  And when they seen that, they knew who John Durham was.  And they knew that he was unbiased and didn't lean right or left.  And they knew they were in big trouble.  So that's what's in the envelopes.  I'll say it again.  William Barr.  John Durham.  It's over.  So that's been Southern Perspectives for today.  And remember, what you do is your own business.  Later on, I'll do an episode and talk about my campaign for county mayor.  So y'all take it easy until then. ",
