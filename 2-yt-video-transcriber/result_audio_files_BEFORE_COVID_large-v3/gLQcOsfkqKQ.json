            "text": "Superhero movies are not great at postmodern deconstruction.  Postmodernism is a movement in art and criticism characterized by mistrust of previous traditions and styles.  Postmodern deconstruction aims to pick apart the piece of art, its themes, its style, its message, and discover a greater truth beneath the surface.  In visual storytelling, postmodern deconstruction generally deconstructs either the genre itself or the themes that are common to the genre as a means of criticizing either genre or themes.  The superhero genre or subgenre contains a great number of commonalities that cross over among intellectual properties and the stories that populate their fictional universes.  Sometimes, these commonalities are lampooned or remarked upon thoughtfully within the narrative.  One commonality among superhero comics is that when a superhero dies, they will almost certainly return one day.  They will either be resurrected within the narrative or their death will be retconned altogether.  this has become so common that comic-book fans have become aware of this inevitability this kneecapping of consequences that it is sometimes addressed within the narrative in a way that could be described as post-modern.  in secret adventures.  number fifteen released in july.  twenty eleven ordinary people are envious of a superhero because their deaths are often not permanent but black widow says that this gives them different consequences not knowing whether or not to mourn never knowing if this is for real this time.  In Catwoman Secret Files and Origins No.  1 from November 2002, Catwoman and Holly talk about resurrections in comics with one of them taking the pro side and the other taking the con side, not so subtly referencing the fact that Holly was retconned back into existence for this run of Catwoman.  This is genre deconstruction, an examination of whether or not a commonality in the genre is worthwhile or a net good.  Now, deconstruction of themes is different.  Common themes across superhero comics and movies include the nature of heroism, duty, sacrifice, and authority.  Sometimes these messages about what it means to be a hero are implicit, such as Spider-Man learning to use his powers for good over the course of a story, and sometimes they are explicit.  A postmodern deconstruction of the common themes of superhero narratives might pose questions.  Should someone have all this power without oversight?  Is it heroic to break the law to potentially save others?  Is it noble to kill people in the service of potentially allowing others to live?  Why do audiences find these actions appealing, and what does it say about our beliefs related to justice that they do?  Postmodern deconstruction of themes looks more like Watchmen.  Released in 1986 and 1987, Watchmen added new weight to the aforementioned common superhero comic themes.  Watchmen posited that some heroes may not be heroic, that duty to mankind might be corrupted, that sacrifice is not always noble, and that authority is to be questioned, not obeyed.  postmodern deconstruction of superheroes became more popular but was still largely relegated to stories outside of the mainstream books such as the out of continuity the dark knight returns and the authority the latter of which was segregated into the wild storm line of comic books.  Some postmodern superhero stories were thoughtful, whereas some others were the boys.  Fast forward to the modern era of superhero media, the explosion of superhero movies in the 21st century.  Mainstream superhero movies did not deconstruct the themes of superhero narratives.  They reinforced them.  any flaws that a superhero might have were not related to deconstructing previous themes and traditions associated with superhero narratives.  they were simply part of the superhero's traditional character arc.  iron man was selfish and concerned only with money and fame and then he grew as a person kind of by the end of the narrative.  the film does not question iron man's actions during his character arc though his violation of airspace and borders as well as his extra-legal executions of human beings are portrayed as heroic.  cool guys don't look at explosions.  This is a character arc, not self-reflection.  In Captain America Civil War, when the Avengers are eventually called out for their behavior, this calling out does not deconstruct the aforementioned themes, but instead frames this admonishment as mostly wrong and coming from the mouths of the antagonists of the film.  Civil War does not question Captain America's heroism or sense of duty or sacrifice.  It reinforces it.  Even if you personally disagree with Captain America's actions, the film still presents him as the protagonist and mostly right.  The authority questioned in the film is not Captain America himself, but anyone who gets in his way.  These movies do not question the themes of superhero narratives, but instead reshape the themes to fit neatly into these movies.  actual deconstruction of superhero narratives within films has been a mixed bag at best.  kick-ass is a pastiche of references to other superhero films a kind of loving genre deconstruction but has very little to say about what the audience considers heroism or what the audience should think about authority.  the comic is different.  deadpool breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience but his commentary is also on the superhero genre and not a deconstruction of why audiences might find the violence superheroes employ against bad guys to be appealing.  the film adaptation of watchmen lightens some of the weight of the narrative by turning the schlubby middle-aged crime-fighters with delusions of grandeur into hyper-competent incredibly buff and sexy superheroes who perform impossibly graceful and cool kung fu in slow motion.  The film adaptation retains a lot of Alan Moore's ideas as much of it is shot-for-shot and directly adapted dialogue from the comic book, but the visual storytelling somewhat alters how the audience is meant to interact with the narrative and feel about Watchmen's thematic deconstruction of superheroics.  Mainstream superhero movies, even those with pretensions of being postmodern, need to walk a careful line.  They need to pose serious questions but never answer them, because the answers are not satisfying to an audience that just came to see Iron Man punch-catapult a man fifty feet into the air, undoubtedly killing him.  Perhaps the best opportunity to do this was also squandered completely.  Earlier this year, the film Brightburn was released, a thinly veiled Superman horror movie without explicitly using said intellectual property.  the opportunity to say something meaningful about those themes was there.  the opportunity to ask the aforementioned questions was there.  this is a postmodern superhero film rated r with no dc or marvel intellectual property to satisfy and coddle.  low budget, which means low stakes for the studio, counter-programming released during the summer movie season for anyone who doesn't want to see the new blockbuster but might be down for the never-fail genre of horror, written by Brian and Mark Gunn, produced by James Gunn, who is apparently bulletproof, and directed by a man named David Urofsky, a filmmaker with no reputation whatsoever and therefore nothing to lose.  And even with all these pieces in place, they made a completely surface-level post-modern Superman movie with base, uninteresting observations and with nothing real to say.  Nothing to say about heroism, authority, or any of that.  Now, someone is already angrily writing a comment to the effect of, why do movies have to say anything?  well maybe they don't have to try to but if you make a horror movie that uses the imagery and iconography of a long-established beloved figure we can't help but think that there must be a reason for that a reason beyond trading on this mythology to get people to watch your movie.  this is the plot of brightburn.  it's the plot of superman except instead of learning about his origins and resolving to do good and save the world he learns about his origins and resolves to do evil and conquer the world.  it's mere inversion.  it's a transgression contrarianism for the sake of being contrarian.  More than that, what if Superman, but bad, isn't even a fresh enough concept to be all that transgressive?  It's a bog-standard horror movie with a sprinkling of Superman on top of it to get people interested.  And it worked.  I went and saw it on the merits of it potentially being actually transgressive and or a proper thematic deconstruction, and what I got was a modestly entertaining by the numbers horror.  there's a blink and you'll miss it moment in which you can make out some words on a young girl's laptop and some of it is a nietzsche quote.  ha ha ubermensch superman get it but this is never explored.  it's an easter egg not breadcrumbs leading to a point.  Worse still, if Brightburn does have a message, that message is the pseudoscience of biological determinism, the discredited idea that your behavior is either exclusively or almost exclusively dictated by your genes and your ethnic background.  It's used by racists to try to justify their place in the world as being above other people.  It's the somewhat more modern form of phrenology, but still deeply outdated and ignores everything we have come to know about people through sociology.  Brandon, the Superman stand-in, is a well-adjusted young boy with caring parents and good values.  when suddenly his biology asserts itself.  He can't escape his nature, his biology.  I would say this is unintentional, except there's this scene early in the film in which Brandon notes the differences between bees and wasps to his teacher, telling her that one is more aggressive by nature than the other.  So Brightburn does have a point, and though the Gunn siblings certainly do not mean it in the way that white supremacists do, it's still roughly the same point made by men like Stefan Molyneux.  We're not bees, everyone.  That shouldn't have to be a controversial statement.  We are animals, but we are not only animals.  I can understand people being bored with deconstruction by now, but I suspect that has less to do with the concept of self-reflection and more to do with the fact that so much of it is transgression for the sake of transgression.  Faux, edgy nonsense.  What if the thing you think is good is actually bad?  That's not clever unless you have a greater point about why.  Obviously, most superhero movies need not be deconstructions of their own mythos.  My favorite superhero movie is Superman, the least transgressive superhero movie ever.  But when a movie tells you through its iconography that it might have something to say about an existing property, genre, or set of themes and then absolutely does not deliver, it's terribly disappointing.  anyway bad superman look how bad he is.  look down in the gutter.  it's a bird it's a plane it's a piece of little kid.  oh and i'm not watching the boys.  so just just don't ask i don't i don't care.  the police have warned everyone to remain in their homes.  this looks like a job for superman.
