First thing first, details of the hoodie giveaway is tomorrow.  Y'all stay tuned because I will be posting about that.  Have all that down for y'all tomorrow.  Secondly, this next video here, I know a lot of you do not like to watch just a whole bunch of back and forth, but honestly, I only did it for this purpose and this purpose only.  I wanted to see the amount of disrespect he had for America.  the Constitution and his oath.  He did not honor his oath.  Again, I only argued with him for the minute or two that I did just to get this answer out of him.  He completely disregarded the Constitution.  He completely disregarded my rights and he... Thought his feelings would kind of rule the conversation, but I shut that down real fast.  That's the only reason I went back and forth with him for this long.  But the good part is at the end of the video, but I just want y'all to watch this first part here.  And the only reason I went on that long with him is to listen to him lie constantly. ",
