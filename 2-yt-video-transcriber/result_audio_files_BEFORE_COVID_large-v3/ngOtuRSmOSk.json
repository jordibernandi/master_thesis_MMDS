            "text": "Andy, say rough.  Say rough.  Say rough.  Would you do it for one buddy snack?  Say rough.  All right.  what is going on everybody?  welcome back to the channel.  um first of all i just want to let you guys know i got a new format that i'm going to put together.  that way i can get my videos out on a more consistent basis.  so wednesdays are going to be wednesday.  wall bangers.  those are going to be my videos of me swiping through sites like tinder and bumble and things like that and showing the crazy women that are out there all around the country.  Saturdays are going to be for the boys.  That's where we're going to have conversations like these, where we talk about important things and just mental stuff and physical stuff, all those types of things.  I'm going to start talking about, I'm starting to work out.  I got a guy that's giving me some advice.  One of my subscribers hit me up for some advice on losing weight and dieting and all that stuff.  So we're going to be talking about things like that, just overall men's health, positivity, things of that nature.  And then I'm gonna sprinkle in throughout the days some of these interview videos once I get those up and rolling.  Should hopefully be by the end of the month here that I get my first interview video done.  So those are gonna be a lot of fun.  I got a lot of ideas for that.  Another side note real quick, I am gonna be changing the channel of the name.  I just have to get to something a little bit easier to remember, easier to explain to people, and also a little bit more neutral so that whenever I do these street interviews I don't have anybody giving me any gruff over my name.  But without further ado, today I want to go over this email that I received from a female subscriber that was asking me some questions about, I guess, just MGTOW in general, the way the state of the guys right now, how they're treating women, all that type of stuff.  I took a little bit of an offense to it because it seems like she really pigeonholed me into a lot of other people and a lot of other channels.  I don't know if she's watching other stuff.  that's a little bit more on the negative side.  But anyways, no matter what, it was a pretty interesting email.  There's some good points.  There's some bad points.  There's some things that make sense and things that don't.  So let's jump right into it.  But real quick before we do.  If you like this video at the end, please make sure you give it a like.  And if you're new here, hit that subscribe button because I got a lot of really good content coming out soon.  So we're going to start this one off with, she says, hi, conservative.  I couldn't find your real name.  That's fine.  I don't get why red pillars feel the need to criticize single mothers on YouTube.  Now, I don't do too much of the criticizing of single mothers.  I bring it up and I talk about it, but there's enough channels out there to tell you all the details and all the reasons of why you should avoid a single mother.  I just, I'm right there with a lot of those reasons.  I mean, I've experienced enough of them, I've dated enough of them, I see where their heads are at and what they got going on, and they're just, Nine times out of 10, they got a lot of stuff going on.  But she gets into some more detailed questions on the single mother thing here, which threw me off a little bit.  Aren't promiscuous men, as a group, responsible for turning a large number of women into single moms?  So right off the bat, we're not taking any responsibility for it, right?  We're gonna go straight to, it's definitely men's fault.  It's a bunch of promiscuous men that are out just having sex with women, knocking them up and leaving them apparently, and that's why we have all these single mothers everywhere, right?  It has nothing to do with the fact that these women are openly having sex with complete strangers that they don't even know.  They're using sex as a tool to get men hooked in.  I talked about this in one of my other videos where it seems like sex nowadays is used more as like a, Like I said, like a tool.  It's almost like they don't have anything else to bring to the table, right?  They've already realized that everything else that they offer isn't that great.  So they go straight to letting you bang them, but then they get upset whenever that's all the guy wants.  So they're training these men.  We do have an issue in the culture.  We do have an issue on both sides of the ball here, but... The real issue is that women have been openly having sex with men with no care ever since feminism told them, don't worry about it, you're just like a man, you can do all the same exact things as a man.  So they've been having this open sex with these men so much that we've turned it into No big deal, right?  It's no big deal to have unprotected sex on the first night with a complete stranger on the very first date and never know anything about them, not even know if you're ever going to see them again.  And we wonder why STDs are on the rise.  We wonder why in 2017 they did 911 abortions a day.  I would hate to see what the numbers are by today's standards.  But there's a reason behind all that is we are having way too much promiscuous sex on both sides of the ball.  So if you're going to blame us on it, the men's side of it, at least take some responsibility on the women's side of it, right?  These guys aren't all raping these women and forcing them to do these things.  This is a lot of consensual sex that's going on between couples.  Now, the other thing I want to say is they say, she says, aren't promiscuous men as a group responsible for turning a large number of women into single moms?  What about the 75% of women that file for divorce?  Does that not have anything to do with it?  Is that not a shocking statistic to you that when it comes to divorce rates, 75 plus percent of all divorces are filed by the female?  So they want to be single moms.  They want to do this.  They want to see what else is out there.  The old school mentality was a woman was good to her man, The man took care of her.  He offered the security.  She offered all the nurturing and the taking care of the family and all of that stuff.  And they balanced off of each other and worked together.  She needed the man to provide for her and he needed her to provide for the family.  So it was a connection.  It was a working partnership.  Now, on the female side of it, they don't need the man to provide for them anymore, right?  They can either, A, they're all career women now.  They've all gone out and went to college.  I mean, the college degrees right now are in the majority of women's side of it.  They're going for crap degrees nine times out of ten, but we talked about that in other videos.  But... the government is now the baby daddy.  So if all else fails and they don't even have a job and they don't want to work or whatever and they just want to get out of that relationship and start going out and seeing Chad and Tyrone, then the government will take care of them.  They can get food stamps, they can get government assistance, they can get money towards putting down on buying a house.  I mean it's endless the number of things that the government will give a single mother.  Far more than they'll ever give a single father.  you have to take some responsibility on the female side of this and say, look, we are choosing this.  We are taking this path, not caring what the future is gonna be.  Now, the truth of it is, and we see that in a lot of my swiping videos, is once they hit that wall age and they're up over the 30s and they've already ran around and done all their fun, They're not finding love.  They're not finding what they should have stayed with from the very beginning.  These guys aren't all out going, hey, look, what's the Bill Burr sign?  Is this a line to get in to lose half my shit?  We're not all out there saying, oh, man, I would really love to get divorced and love to have children or love to get married, love to have children with this woman.  And then one day I'm just going to throw her to the curb because I don't want nothing to do with her.  It's all our men's fault.  We're all pushing these women into single motherhood, apparently.  So that's my answer for that for her.  Don't you advocate promiscuity?  I do not.  I mean, I'm not.  Honestly, guys, I'm on like a two-year point right now that I haven't had sex.  I don't even think about it anymore.  I mean, I've got more important things going on in my life.  I'm worrying about this channel.  I'm worrying about my business.  I'm worrying about my kids.  I've got more than enough stuff going on in my life that... I just don't have the time for it.  There's so many strings attached to getting laid that if I really wanted it that bad, I would just go pay for it.  So, I mean, there probably are a lot of guys, I know there's a lot of MGTOW guys out there that do push, you know, being promiscuous and running around and doing your own thing and pump and dump and all that stuff.  I'm not one of those guys.  I don't really believe in that.  I'm not a one night stand type of a guy.  You know, I'd like to have some sort of a connection there.  Call me old fashioned, whatever, but that's the way it is for me.  So clearly you haven't been watching my videos because I've explained that multiple times.  If a single mom had been married but failed in marriage, how different is she from you?  That's basically what I just talked about.  That's fine if she's married, but a lot of these women, they're leaving marriage hoping to find something better.  They can't be happy with what they have.  They don't see that value in that relationship anymore.  It's a competition.  So they don't want that competition.  They want to go out and have a good time.  They, you know, what happens is they join the gym and a bunch of guys at the gym start paying attention to him, right?  A bunch of young guys, especially those are the guys that just want to pump and dump you.  That young generation is all about pump and dump.  I mean, you get into those 20 somethings like my nephew and his buddy and stuff like that.  That's all they're about, man.  They love it.  That's their life.  They will, anything, anything that walks, anything that can fog a mirror, they'll take care of it.  So I don't, I don't think that the marriage side of it means anything anymore.  That's the bottom line to it.  So whether it's a male or a female, but the female side of it, like I said, men aren't out there just getting in line and ready to lose all their stuff.  This is a female-oriented business to be able to divorce, rape a man and take all his money and take half of his stuff and his pensions and his retirement funds and his savings and everything.  everything they can just take it all.  so i've seen i've heard stories of i think that somebody messaged me about a woman who made more than the man and still demanded money from the man when they got divorced and she made way more than the man did.  so it's it's just.  it's crazy out there right now.  so just because she failed in marriage it's not even that she failed in marriage nine times out of ten.  they're not trying they're not even putting in the effort to try Moving on.  I think no matter what you do, you will have trouble forming a second relationship.  Your first marriage was supposed to work out for some reason.  It didn't.  Look, are there things I did in my marriage I could have done a little bit better?  Sure.  I probably should have.  I always said I forgot.  We got married so young.  We had kids so early.  I feel like I... I forgot to keep the flame going, if you will.  But I honestly think that no matter what I would have done, inevitably, I would have ended up in the same spot.  Because I feel overall, I was a pretty good guy.  You know what I mean?  I'm not a drinker.  I'm not a druggie.  I'm not abusive.  I always had a job.  I always brought home money.  I'm a really good dad.  I take care of my children.  So I just feel like we had kids so early that all of our attention went from each other to the children.  And that just kind of probably pushed things along a little bit faster.  In some way, you will always be married to the mother of your children.  Guys, 100% true.  She says, regardless of your actual marital status, because of your ties to those children.  So just keep that in mind.  If you do marry a woman and you do have children with them, you are married to them for life.  I mean, I just had to see my ex twice this week to go to kids orientation.  I got to talk to her all the time on the phone about who's buying what and who's doing what for the kids.  I got to figure out picking them up, dropping them off, schedules, bus pickups, everything.  I mean, I am, no matter what, until these kids, or even once they're older and out, I'm still gonna have to deal with their marriages and weddings and stuff like that, but you are always married to that woman.  No matter what happens, no matter when you get divorced, you will always have to deal with her.  You're always gonna have some sort of a tie to her, so she's 100% right there.  In some sense, divorced men with kids are better off staying single.  MGTOW is not such a new idea.  So she's right there.  You'll see a lot of guys.  I see a lot of guys in the comments, especially to talk about, you know, I've been MGTOW for 40 years and things like that.  But I think we just recently put more of a term to it where it's more of an open term where people talk about it more.  I mean, it's probably one of the number one trending things on YouTube right now for videos.  So keep that in mind.  But I do agree that divorced men with kids probably are better off staying single because the last thing these kids need to see, look, I can tell you right now, mom's gonna have guys in and out of the house, no matter what.  I mean, I've seen another comment the other day of a guy that said that he had his sister for like eight years has been single and has had eight different guys in her life every year.  Like almost every year has a new dude in her life and they're meeting the kids and all that stuff.  So she's already gonna be doing that.  you don't need to do it either, man.  You need to be the stable of, you know, the picture of security that shows them, look, this is what you can do.  You can be on your own.  You can do your own thing.  You can take care of yourself and you don't need to have that attention all the time.  So I do agree with that.  All right, moving on.  I don't understand why you only want sex and aren't looking for the true love of your life.  Not true.  I don't even look for sex right now.  I mean, if it came along and it was in an easy package and we could have a good time and actually enjoy each other, fine.  But why I'm not looking for the true love of your life, I've tried.  I went out and dated.  What do you want me?  You want me to keep going on dates, keep spending money on girls, keep being the beta male provider to all these different women and let them make their decisions of whether or not they want to be with me.  So I should keep trying no matter what and give them the option to mess with me.  Pass.  That's the mentality of a woman is why don't you try to find true love?  It's out there.  Why aren't you looking for it?  It could be right in your face.  Have you thought of dating a woman to get to know her without having sex?  I did try that.  Horrible.  You know why?  Because she pushes sex.  I've tried to go months with meeting a girl and saying, hey, look, let's just do this relationship thing and let's not have sex right off the bat.  Let's not muddy the waters with that because I really do think that for a guy, look, I watched a video the other day where this guy went out and he asked 100 girls on the street would they have sex with him.  And it was like, he was getting water thrown in his face, slapped.  I mean, women were just disgusted by it.  Some women are just like, no thank you or whatever.  But honestly, no matter what, when men, she had a woman go out and do it to men and say, well, ask 100 men, would you have sex with me?  And I mean, these guys were like, hell yeah, I'll do it right now.  Where do you want to go?  How far?  You want to go to the alley back here?  Like, that's just the mentality that's always going to be there.  That's one of those differences between men and women where, yeah, you ask a man to have sex, he's probably going to say yes to it.  So, You cannot blame these guys that just want to have sex whenever the women are just giving it to them, right?  It's almost like when it comes to sex, guys are like little kids.  They just don't know any better.  So they just do it.  They're like, yeah, anytime, any day of the week, let's go, let's go.  Like I said, those are good videos to watch.  I'll link them up top.  They're fun to watch because it was a fun experiment on his part.  Sex was never meant for people outside of marriage.  The proof is that it backfires as it has in your life.  100% agree.  So that's another good comment that she's made.  Sex was always meant to be part of marriage.  It was meant to be a bonding mechanism between those people.  The other thing that I've heard too is that the more sexual partners you have in your life, the less meaningful sex becomes.  So therefore, that connection is harder to form whenever you start a relationship with somebody.  because now that connection's gone because it's just another woman that you're having sex with.  You're always left alone after each new love interest.  I mean, I'm never left alone.  I'm not afraid of being alone, but I get what she's saying.  Every time you meet somebody and you go through that endeavor and then you drop them, it is what it is.  And the woman is left damaged.  So we're left alone, the woman's left damaged.  There's no damage done to the guys at all.  Why is it okay for other people's, or here, this is my favorite.  Would you want that for your daughters?  I am so sick and tired of people bringing up my daughters whenever it comes to dating and sex and all that stuff.  I get it.  OK, I get it.  I got two girls.  That's why I'm the way I am.  I'm not some crazy, you know, he man woman hater club where I'm like, all these women are bad and all these women are horrible and we need to just do away with them.  I'm not that guy because I have daughters and I realize that they need to have a future as well.  So why?  Why is that OK for other people's daughters to be harmed by you?  So again, all the man's fault, right?  The menace, we're harming other people's daughters by having sex that they're allowing us to have or that they're asking to have.  Like I said, whenever I try to not have sex with a girl, I tell you what, you wanna get laid hard, you tell them no and you take it away, you take it off the table, bananas afterwards, bananas.  um i bet if you asked all your post divorce conquest conquests not relationships.  they're my conquests.  i'm so happy that i i yeah okay.  um if i asked all my post divorce conquest what they thought of sex with you they would say it was a mistake.  okay if you ask me about a lot of the sex i had with these women i would also say it was a mistake.  Also, you didn't leave all these women because sex wasn't right, but rather you left them because of some flaw you perceived in them or the relationship.  I left them nine times out of 10 because the relationship went from zero to 100 so fast it made my head snap.  I mean, I'm going from just getting to know these women and just starting a relationship to talking about moving in together, integrating our kids together, just crazy stuff.  No, that's the problem right now is that once you hit that 30 plus range, you're basically just dealing with a bunch of women whose clocks are ticking who want a relationship so bad and will push it.  Look at my swiping videos whenever you see all these women are 35, 36, 37, and it still says that they wanna have kids.  How fast does that relationship need to move in order to have kids?  So nine out of 10 of my relationships have failed.  I will say it's probably a big part of me because I was probably being a little bit too picky on what I was expecting out of these relationships.  And I just feel like they're not bringing anything to the tape.  Sex is nothing.  I don't need that.  That's not important to me.  Once you get that out of your mind and you can put that aside and just say, look, sex is what it is.  If I get it, I get it.  If I don't, I don't.  What I want are these other things that are more valuable.  I want somebody who's loyal, somebody who takes care of stuff, you know, somebody who takes care of the family and helps out as a team.  And when you start seeing none of that there, it becomes worthless.  The sex becomes nothing.  So why put women through this sex test?  It doesn't help them or you.  Again, like I said, this lady's entire email is based on the fact that the guy is taking advantage of the woman, that he's forcing the issue of sex, that he's the one that that's all he wants and that's all he's doing and that he's giving them a sex test.  My hope is that you will go to a Catholic view of marriage.  Unfortunately, I'm just not a religious guy.  I grew up as a Catholic.  I went to a Catholic school all my life.  I've seen firsthand a lot of the stuff that goes on.  I've seen firsthand a lot of the families that went to church on Sundays and acted like they were perfect and great and the whole family was perfect.  And then I would hang out with their kids on the other days, and I'd see them beating the kids, and they'd have paddles above the wall that they would use to smack the kids' butts and scream at the wives and just, I don't know.  I didn't like it.  I didn't like it at all.  It was almost too much of a controlling relationship I've seen with a lot of them where the guy was just dominant over the woman.  I don't need that either, man.  I do want somebody to be a part.  If I'm going to have somebody in my life, they're going to compliment my life.  They're going to bring the things that I don't already have to the table, right?  They're not going to complicate my life.  They're not going to make my life harder.  So I'm just not a religious guy, and it's probably not going to happen.  But marriage was meant for life.  That's what I thought.  My parents were still together at the time.  Well, my parents are still together, but I've since seen the truth in a lot of their relationship.  I always thought that you got married for life, thick and thin, good and bad, sickness and health, and all the crap they tell you to say whenever you're signing into that horrible, horrible contract.  Is there any chance your ex would take you back?  I'm gonna bet one day she's gonna wish that she would've taken me back.  but I'm never gonna let it happen.  I'll see you next time, guys. ",
