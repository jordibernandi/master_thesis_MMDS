That opening scene, incidentally, is from Billy Madison, perhaps the greatest comedy in the history of humankind.  Undoubtedly Bradley Whitford's most compelling performance ever as Eric before he hit the big time on the West Wing.  Alright, but enough pop culture references.  It's time to talk about the impeachment hearings.  For those of you who have been living under a rock, the impeachment hearings summarized in one breath.  Let's see if I can do this.  There have been renewed calls for the impeachment of Donald Trump as a result of a phone conversation he had with the president of the Ukraine, Zelensky, in which it is alleged that he engaged in an impeachable quid pro quo withholding aid for military stuff, in exchange for which the Ukraine would confirm that they would renew an investigation into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden's son for the role he played in Burisma Holdings.  Okay, that's pretty darn good and I'm not giving that a second try.  The underlying argument is that this is an impeachable quid pro quo because Trump was pressuring Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival and withholding some $400 million in aid that was approved to be dispersed to the Ukraine.  The first public impeachment hearings occurred the other day, although there was behind closed door testimony a couple of weeks ago.  And the first two star witnesses in these public impeachment hearing inquiries were George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, and Bill Taylor, the US ambassador to the Ukraine.  And I know some of you are getting irritated at my use of the Ukraine instead of Ukraine, but it is arguable which one is proper, and I prefer the Ukraine because it sounds more the official.  What?  And although these hearings, for the most part, are nothing more than political grandstanding and political theater, they are nonetheless educational to watch from a legal perspective.  But first things first, let's just explain what the impeachment inquiry is all about.  Contrary to public misconception, impeachment does not mean the removal of a public officer from office.  To draw an analogy to criminal law, the impeachment is sort of like the indictment.  It is not the conviction itself.  So the impeachment would be like the indictment of the president to be removed from office, but not the actual removal of the president from office until the impeachment has been approved by the... Senate.  By the Senate.  And this is how it would work.  The House would vote to approve impeachment articles.  Going back to the criminal law analogy, the House would basically vote to approve the indictment.  The trial on the indictment then goes to the Senate.  In order to approve the articles of impeachment or the indictment that would then be submitted to the Senate, it only requires a simple majority of the House.  If or when the articles of impeachment, the indictment, are approved by a majority vote in the House, they are then submitted to the Senate, where, in order to be convicted, it requires a two-thirds supermajority vote by the Senate.  We are now getting the public inquiry, which is the political grandstanding that goes along with these hearings, as the underlying sort of mini-trial to determine whether or not the House is going to approve articles of impeachment to then submit them to the Senate.  There has been no impeachment yet, there have been no articles of impeachment approved.  Right now we are just having a public inquiry, which is going to serve as the basis for the House voting on whether to approve articles of impeachment, which they would then submit to the Senate.  And the hearing is a show.  Now, full disclosure, I have not and probably will not watch the hearings in their entirety.  There's just too much of it and it is just too tedious.  But I have had it running in the background and I go to YouTube to watch the highlights.  And yesterday I saw a highlight of highlights. ",

Representative Mike Quigley publicly affirming for the benefit of the nation that there are times when hearsay evidence is actually better than direct evidence.  I am 1000% open for public discussion on this question, and if there's anyone out there who vehemently disagrees with the statement I'm about to make, please leave a comment in the comment section below as to why.  Never is hearsay evidence better than direct evidence, period.  Typically, people understand hearsay evidence as being someone told me something and now I'm telling it to you without having that person say it directly.  And that understanding of hearsay evidence is accurate enough for all intents and purposes, but hearsay evidence is either a written or verbal statement made out of court but presented in court to prove the truthfulness of that statement.  And it is generally considered to be inadmissible.  Why?  Because you don't get to cross-examine the person having made the statement on the truthfulness of that statement.  And that is why you have the dichotomy between hearsay evidence and direct evidence.  Hearsay evidence, by definition, is not direct evidence, it's indirect evidence.  Incidentally, I've done a few videos on the subject right now.  I'll post the playlist right here.  And another YouTube lawyer named Legal Eagle also did a full video on the hearsay exception.  But hearsay is just that.  It is an exception.  It is only under certain well-established legal exceptions that hearsay as evidence is admissible as opposed to direct evidence.  But to give Representative Quigley the full benefit of the doubt, I can really only think of one example where hearsay evidence is actually better than direct evidence, and that would be when the person having made the statement is dead.  Yes, you will never again be able to get direct evidence or cross-examine the person who made the statement, so you may have to rely on the exception of hearsay.  Another example might be where if disclosing the identity of the witness, you would compromise their safety, so it's better to rely on a written statement as opposed to viva voce testimony.  But even then, the hearsay evidence is not better than direct evidence, there just might be an exception as to why it would be admissible.  And even then, it wouldn't be a question of circumventing the fundamental right to cross-examine the witness on their statement, it might just be done in other means that would not require disclosing the identity of the witness.  So no, and please, somebody correct me if you think I'm wrong, there is no circumstance in which hearsay evidence is better than direct evidence.  But that is not the only lesson in law that we can take away from Quigley's examination of the two witnesses.  And whether or not you agree with this or approve of it, it is nonetheless a fact.  These impeachment hearings are drawn on political lines.  In theory, it should be about justice, it should be about the truth,  etc.,  etc.,  but in reality, it is purely political.  And so with that in mind, these witnesses are going to be either hostile or friendly witnesses depending on who is examining them.  When a Democrat is examining Kent or Taylor, they are basically treating them like friendly witnesses.  They have the same end goal and objectives in mind.  And that is why we see the Democrats asking the witnesses what we call leading questions.  Compare that to when Republicans are asking them the questions, and you see that they have diverging interests.  Taylor and Kent, as the end goal, have in mind the impeachable quid pro quo, whereas the Republican doesn't necessarily have that same goal.  And it is reflected in the manner in which the Republicans are asking the questions.  Republicans are treating them like hostile witnesses.  Democrats are treating them like friendly witnesses.  But even in treating them as friendly witnesses with leading questions, Quigley had some serious problems with his examination. ",

Typically, when dealing with your own witness, you're not allowed asking them leading questions because they are supposed to know their own story without being coaxed by their attorney.  In this case, because the interests of these witnesses are aligned with Representative Quigley in the ultimate goal of impeachment, they are basically friendly witnesses and in theory should not be asked leading questions.  Leading Okay, opening up a parenthesis, I appreciate that the rules of procedure or the rules of evidence are not the same in these impeachment inquiry hearings as they would otherwise be in the standard court of law.  And when I'm talking about the appropriateness of asking leading questions, it's not to determine the admissibility of the evidence.  Bear in mind that if you ask your own witnesses leading questions in a court of law, the opposing counsel can object to those questions and a judge cannot allow those questions because they are leading.  So, for example, you ask your own witness, ooh, and I bet that made you feel very bad and you found that very hurtful.  Objection, leading question.  And a judge can say, no, I'm not allowing that question as formulated.  Rephrase the question so that it is not leading.  Rephrase it, for example, so how did that make you feel?  And so, for example, when Quigley is examining Kent and Taylor, if he has to ask them too many leading questions, it sort of undermines their credibility as far as the story goes that they're trying to tell.  So I'm not making these observations as a question of admissibility of evidence, but rather just as relates to the credibility of the witnesses.  Back to the video.  Basically, leading questions are structured such that the questioner is making an affirmation and asking the witness to agree with it. ",

In law, you don't score points by asking loaded questions that the witness doesn't in fact confirm.  You in fact lose credibility by doing that.  If these hearings are good for one thing other than wasting taxpayer dollars, they are in learning how to examine witnesses, both friendly and hostile.
