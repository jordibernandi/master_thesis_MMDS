            "text": "Well, today, YouTube basically reversed itself.  It reversed itself by going after a guy with whom I am friends, Steven Crowder.  So they say, well, you know, Crowder hasn't violated any of our policies that require us to take down his stuff, but we will demonetize all his videos.  You've seen them go after Laura Ingraham.  You've seen them go after Tucker Carlson.  You've seen them go after Sean Hannity.  You've seen them go after Rush Limbaugh.  They are intent on destroying any possibility of you receiving the information you want from shows like this one.  They don't care about platforms existing where we can have conversations.  And this is why I'm calling on you today.  I need you to subscribe to our show over at dailywire.com.  And I'd love to have you subscribe for a variety of reasons, including the fact we bring you really great material.  But this is now an issue of whether the market is even available for ideas.  You can help fight them.  Free speech can only survive with your support.  Please head over to dailywire.com right now.  I'm really asking you sincerely, please subscribe.  It helps us bring you the show.  And it makes sure that when the left comes after us, just as they do every other conservative show, then we will continue to stand because we're not going to kowtow to their politics.  I'm not going to change my message.  That's something I'm not going to do. ",
