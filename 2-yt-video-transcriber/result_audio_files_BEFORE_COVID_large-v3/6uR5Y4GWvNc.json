And the reason why this rumor isn't going away is that technically this could be done.  The problem is people living before the days of Joshua's long day did not record their solar eclipses with sufficient timing accuracy, or geographical accuracy either to prove what you see in the Bible or to disprove it.  So the fact that it can't be disproved by science I think also explains the longevity of this rumor.

Actually, in the original Hebrew, it's talking about God providing an extended period of darkness or an extended period of light to a small valley, the valley of Agila, where a battle took place.

In fact, most tell me that that's the more likely translation is that it's an extended period of darkness, not an extended period of light.  And having grown up in coastal British Columbia, I can remember storm events where in the middle of the day it was as dark as it was at night because of how intense the storm was.  That would be extremely unusual for the Valley of Agila and being in the middle of the Negev Desert.  So it's nonetheless miraculous.
