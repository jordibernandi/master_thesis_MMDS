This was one of my favorite shows as a kid.  And most teenagers who grew up during that era were huge fans of the show.  Now, the show is going to be rebooted.  They're going to be bringing back the show in 2020 with some of the original cast members coming back to the show.  So check out for that.  It's going to be hitting the airwaves.  I'm glad that it's going back on the air.  Check out my video, leave a comment, rate and subscribe. ",
