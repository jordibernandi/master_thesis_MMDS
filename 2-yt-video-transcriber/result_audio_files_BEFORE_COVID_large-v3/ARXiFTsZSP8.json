            "text": "Here's a horror story for you.  Imagine spending the rest of your life revising this one story.  Hello, Cinnamon Bun.  If you are feeling a little bit overwhelmed with where to start revising your story, good God, you are not alone.  That's why in this video, I want to give you some clarity and focus on where to begin with your revision.  how to go about it and how not to go about it.  By the end of this video, yes, you will still have a lot of work ahead of you, but hopefully you will have a path instead of feeling like you're surrounded by noveling wilderness with no idea which direction you're gonna go.  When I started trying to revise my first novel, it was completely ineffectual and basically everything that I did there, I did not keep into further revisions.  10 years later though, I feel like I have complete clarity about the revision process.  That doesn't mean it's always easy, but no matter what happens, I always know what my next step is.  And that can be such a relief.  Offering practical and procedural solutions to writing problems is kind of my thing.  And it's why the majority of writers that I work with in one-to-one Skype sessions end up becoming repeat clients.  So today let's apply that to revision.  I have seven guiding principles to share with you.  Number one is to let it rest.  You cannot revise a story that you have just finished writing.  You have to let it rest a little while before you come back to it.  How long exactly you let it rest for is up to you and how much time you have.  But unless you're on a publishing deadline, I would aim for getting at least a month away from it.  This fallow time is really, really important.  And I know that you are desperate to start getting in there and fixing all the stuff that you know is wrong with it.  But trust me, really try to enjoy this break from your story.  You could spend it not writing at all, taking a break completely.  You could spend it working on a different project, or you could even spend it kind of developing your skills as a writer, you know, doing and writing exercises or challenges and kind of getting experimental.  All of these are worthwhile ways to spend that time away from your story.  when you come back to it.  The next thing to remember is substance before style.  This one is so important that I would like to have it engraved on a gold plaque and hung on my front door.  It's a motto that you might have heard me use before.  Take any part of your story, take a paragraph or scene, a whole chapter or even a whole subplot, there is absolutely no point in polishing that up to read beautifully if you don't know yet if it deserves to be in this story.  There's no pain worse than working really hard on polishing up, say, three chapters, making them sound absolutely amazing, and then realising that they actually all need to go in the bin.  You've already put your time and effort and brainpower into writing the first draft of this scene.  You do not want to add any more to that before establishing that this really is a crucial part of the story and it's going to be in the final version.  You fix the story, what is actually happening to the characters, before you spend one minute making anything stylish or beautiful or read well.  That means even before fixing typos too.  There is no point beautifully reupholstering a sofa in silk when the frame has been eaten by termites and the second anyone sits on it, it's gonna come crashing down.  So here's a tip for determining if what you're working on is substance or style.  Substance is the raw material of what happens in the story and why, what it means.  Style is everything about the way that you present that raw material.  Substance is character motives, conflict, plot, resolutions, world building, all the things that would stay if your story was going to be adapted into another medium.  Prose The individual sentences that you use to convey these things, word choice, spelling, grammar, imagery, all that stuff, that is all style.  So remember, always revise to fix substance before style.  A third piece of advice is to go in with a system or a plan.  A system plan.  A plan system, if you will.  A plan of attack.  Writing a first draft obviously has its own struggles, but one great thing about it is that most of us know that when you get to the end of the story, you have finished the first draft.  Revision, on the other hand, is a potentially infinite activity.  If a first draft is like a journey through the woods of novelling wilderness from A to B, revision is more like stepping out of the airlock in your spacesuit.  You could quite easily just float into the abyss and be stuck there forever.  Your plan, your system, your workflow, that is your tether.  That is that cord connecting you back to the airlock where you just came from to ensure that you don't float off into space and die out there.  That tether will allow you to navigate, to move around, to eventually find your way back home, to make sure that this spacewalk has an end.  I'm going to wrap up this point with a prime piece of grandmother-level scaremongering.  Here's a horror story for you.  Imagine spending the rest of your life revising this one story.  Let that horrifying idea be your motivation to go into revision with a plan and a system.  And following along from that, a revision outline is going to be your best friend.  Everybody's different.  I'm going to quote my friend, Nick Marino, there are no right ways to write, but there are effective ways to write.  When it comes to first drafts, whatever you got to do to get to the end of that draft is the right thing to do.  However much planning or pantsing that might be.  whatever works for you is the most effective thing to do.  But I'm gonna plant a flag in the sand here, so bear with me.  When it comes to revision, I don't think that an outline is optional anymore.  To make this a good story as a whole, a good novel as a whole, not just on a sentence level, you kinda need to be able to see the beams that are holding it up, to be able to smack them with your hand and go, yeah, that's stable.  You need to know and be able to understand that everything is working together to create that wonderful journey for the reader that you initially envisioned.  That's why one of the most important and helpful things you can do for your vision to start with is creating an outline of the books that you want to have to guide you as you make those changes from what you've got, which is probably not something you're particularly happy with, to what you want.  Yes, everyone's different.  different things work for different people but when I see people saying that they don't need a revision during any stage of the writing process it's kind of like seeing someone trying to dig a tunnel with a spoon and you offer them a shovel and they're like no I do it my own way.  okay everyone's different and you're like sure hun but like don't?  you want this shovel?  the outline is the shovel.  use the shovel.  The next thing you're going to want to do is to change the format and if possible, even work on paper.  Trying to revise a story in the exact same format that you wrote it in is a little bit of a recipe for disaster.  It's going to be 10 times harder.  The reason that you let it rest is because you need a fresh perspective on this beast and The next best way to get that fresh perspective is to change the way it physically looks.  You want to be able to see it in a new light, with some new distance.  I highly recommend working on paper to revise most of the time.  You just see things on paper that you wouldn't on a screen for some reason.  I can't explain why, it's just true.  It's easier to catch things for some reason.  It's a bigger change in how it looks from changing what it looks like on a screen to it being on the screen and then being in your hands.  And I really valuable that analog experience of being able to hold it in my hand of being able to shuffle the pages around.  And one of the hardest things about revision is feeling like you're actually making progress through what seems like an endless process and having that stack of pages that are to do and pages that are done really helps with that.  It actually lets you see your progress physically.  And if you are squirming at the idea of using paper, if you are leaning towards like wanting to keep everything digital because you don't want to use paper, commit to recycling it.  Paper personally is the only thing that I recycle.  I'm a writer and my work requires paper and I've accepted that.  And so I commit to recycling it.  In fact, that's why my desk bin is literally only for paper recycling.  It's not a bin I use for anything else because I know I go through quite a lot of paper.  Don't shortchange your story or your novel out of fear of using paper, out of fear of using the tools that you need to use.  Just commit and recycle it and don't feel guilty.  When it comes to printing your manuscript, you want it to look different than it looked when you were writing it.  And you also want it to be double spaced.  You need that double spacing because you need to be able to write in between the lines.  It's really important to actually have the space to revise on the page.  So you want to change the font.  possibly even the size of the text and the margins, anything to make it look different enough that it looks unfamiliar to you.  Keep tweaking it until you're happy with it.  If you typed double spaced, then you're going to have to change more of the other things to make it look different enough.  But if you typed your first draft in single spaced, then it's going to be a lot easier for it to look much more different in manuscript form.  For your first read-through, as you're preparing to revise, you can even export it to your Kindle or e-reader.  That's a really good way to make it feel unfamiliar as you read it.  Let's talk about keeping track of your drafts.  I think all of us as writers should be aiming for as few drafts as possible.  If you're on your first few stories or your first few novels, as few drafts as possible might still be 10 drafts.  That's fine.  But I think it makes sense for us to all be working towards getting more efficient with our revisions and working down to, like for me, it would ideally be one or two drafts max.  I'm not there yet, but working on it.  How do you keep track of your drafts?  Number them.  This may sound very simple.  It's a tip actually from Scarlett Thomas's book, Monkeys with Typewriters, which has helped me enormously.  Don't kid yourself with file titles like novel, final revision, novel, final, final revision, last revision of this novel, really this time.  If you have to go back into your files to find something, it's impossible.  And a lot of the time, you don't actually decide if this is the last draft or not.  Sometimes it's your novel.  And often you only realise or can discern if this is the last draft after the draft is done.  So it doesn't really make sense to try and name it beforehand.  Have you done this before?  Write final, final draft in the comments if you have done this with your files, because I know I have.  Stick to draft one, draft two, and continue from there and save yourself the headache.  It will make it so much easier to navigate.  You still get to aim for making draft three the last one, but then if it turns out actually you need a little draft four as well, then you're still gonna be able to do that easily.  I guess aim for every draft to be the last draft, but be prepared for it to not be.  And finally, how to know when the revision is done.  Let's go back to that terrifying concept of infinity again.  If you can, in theory, keep revising, Forever.  How the hell do you ever know that you're done?  Sometimes you do just know.  You're like, I know that this is done.  I can feel it.  But a lot of the time, it's not really about feeling like it's done.  It's about deciding that it's done.  And sometimes it's about just being so fucking done that you never want to look at the thing again.  Been there.  Keep in mind that it is never your aim to write a perfect book.  You are never going to do that.  There is no such thing.  Your aim then is to write the best book that you are capable of right now, and then to move on to the next project armed with whatever it taught you.  The next thing is always going to be better.  So have you told the story that you set out to tell?  Are you now just making it different instead of better?  Is this the best version of the story that you are capable of right now?  Do whatever you have to do to make peace with the fact that this story will be flawed and finished at the same time.  All of them will be.  Everything you do will be.  So don't ask, is it flawed?  Or is there stuff that could be done better?  Is it perfect?  Ask, is it flawed but finished?  If it is, then you're done.  And if at any point you are kind of stuck in this like deciding if it's finished kind of phase, you're unsure, then I would recommend getting a bit of perspective on that by either watching or re-watching my video on perfectionism.  That will help you out.  And that's how you get started with revision.  So give me a like if you took away something helpful from this video and I guess give me a dislike if you think that I'm a hipster goblin or you like hate my accent or whatever, honesty is important.  I make two new videos every month for YouTube and one for Patreon.  so if you are into that be sure to subscribe and if you hit the bell little button thing then you'll get notified of every video rather than just whatever the fuck the algorithm wants to do with itself.  Let me know in the comments what part of this video did you most need to hear?  I'm really interested to see what resonates most with you guys.  And if you are serious about revising your novel or your story, don't forget to pick up the story revision starter guide that I created to go along with this video.  It'll really help you put this into practice instead of it just becoming another, like, oh, I should do that kind of thing that haunts the back of your mind.  Okay, love you, bye!  Oh, I'm all stiffly now.  Today we have cardamom tea with cream because the milk is done.  I think I might have over-steeped it a bit.  Sideburns.  Roll.  Use the shovel!  I'm going to get that on a t-shirt and no one's going to know what it means.  Right, let's get along with this then.  I don't know why I'm speaking like that.  I'm really sorry, English people.  Why can't I say the words? ",
