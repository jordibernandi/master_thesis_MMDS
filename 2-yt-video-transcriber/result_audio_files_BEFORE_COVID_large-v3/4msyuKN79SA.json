            "text": "Hi brothers and sisters, it's Pastor Tim Henderson.  As I was finishing up and when I was done with the surgery today and did a video with my daughter, again, I want to thank so many of you for your prayers.  It was successful.  A new name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life.  Praise God.  Got to witness along the way.  And we give all the glory to God.  God is so faithful.  And with a retinal surgery, not having to look down for hours a day is truly amazing.  a blessing from the Lord.  So thank you.  I also, because I want to talk about Notre Dame, that many of you were the first to actually let me know.  And I didn't post right away.  Well, driving back, we were a couple hours away for the surgery from where I live.  But, um, I want to do a little bit of, I want to do two specific thank yous.  One is, and I cannot garner whom this is from, but back a few weeks ago in a video, it was just mentioned how I kind of raided our pantry to help those in need.  And my wife made that comment.  and to the brother, sister or both who sent those boxes to replace pantry things I want you to know what a blessing that was but also that was a huge hug from the Lord to us and we received it that way.  it just meant so much that someone would actually take something that wasn't there was no request and just did something really nice and then heaven-bound.  I get home to a letter of And a gift from you that the Lord moved on you to bless my wife.  For me to bless my wife.  And I want to say thank you.  Again, you did not need to do that.  And I feel like we have such a wonderful family here.  And God is doing a great thing in these final moments of the end of days.  Yes, we are helping with crisis pregnancy.  We're helping with missions.  We're helping with human trafficking.  But we are a family.  It's like the remnant that God has brought together on this channel overwhelmingly, the love and the support for one another.  I just want you all to know, all of you, I want you to know, How much I appreciate and love every one of you.  I knew going into this that my brothers and sisters, I could cry when I think about it, were praying for me.  And I went and prayed up, believing, and look what happened.  This is abnormal that I don't have to go through what most people go through.  Looks bad, but really, praise God, brothers and sisters.  Your prayers worked.  They had an impact.  And a woman came to faith in Yeshua, in Jesus.  Praise God.  Praise God.  We rejoice with the angels.  So again, I just wanted to share that with you and thank you.  I truly am so thankful.  For the fellowship.  And it's almost like this channel is a reflection of what we're going to experience soon when we're together.  Praise God.  We're in this together.  And I so love and appreciate you all.  Know God loves you fiercely and passionately.  And I love you too.  Now I want to talk for a moment about Notre Dame.  I believe it was built in somewhere around 1163 AD.  It is medieval Gothic architecture.  I have had the privilege of being at Notre Dame.  Maybe one day I'll talk about my trip to France and how God moved in a mighty way.  What a fantastic trip that was, anointed by the Lord, divine appointments.  I was sent on business as a trainer where people came in for six countries.  And I may do a video on that because God really used that.  Not only did people come to saving faith in Jesus, but he also used it in my life to move me to a new level.  Praise God.  So I prayed about this, and without getting into all the symbolism and trying to make up meaning, I just said, Lord, this just does not, this just doesn't seem like, oh, Notre Dame is burning down.  I firmly believe that the globalists may be behind this.  as I've prayed, brothers and sisters, as I get a stirring in my spirit, and I believe it is significant that It's not biblical prophecy that is saying, hey, Notre Dame is going to be burnt down.  But I believe that it is a significant sign for us in these final moments of the end of days as we are heading into, in just a few days, into Passover.  And it being in the heart of Europe, being such a renowned symbol of France, of Europe, And I mean, even when I remember going through, there are, and again, not getting into symbolisms.  I don't worship statues.  I don't list.  I praise God.  I am saved by grace through faith.  I know Jesus always was God.  There's father, God, son, God.  Holy Spirit God, the eternally self-existent God in the persons of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  He left glory and laid down his glory, was wrapped in flesh, born of a virgin, lived a perfect life.  Jesus never sinned.  And he shed his precious blood on the cross at Calvary to pay the debt for our sins.  It was all sufficient.  It was once for all my past, present, and future sins.  I believe, as 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4 says, in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, he died, he was buried, and on the third day he rose from the dead.  I am saved by grace through faith.  Not of myself.  It is the gift of God.  We call it the free gift of salvation.  Not by works, lest anyone should boast.  Now, because I am saved, I've been born again.  I've been created in his workmanship.  unto good works.  We are not saved by works.  We are not kept by works.  We are saved for works.  So take all the symbolism out of it.  But when you go through, I think there was something like 23 statues of kings of Israel in Notre Dame.  It was truly the architecture when you go through Europe.  When I was in Portugal on an evangelistic missionary trip preaching, when We were in Spain, my wife and I, and Germany and Rome.  all for ministry, preaching in Rome, seeing people supernaturally, miraculously healed.  More importantly, come to faith in Jesus, in Christ, in Christ alone.  Praise God.  But it was fantastic architecture, and I firmly believe, and do you, for those of us in the United States, today is tax day.  Today is the deadline.  If you haven't gotten your taxes in yet, I encourage you to do that.  But I just wanted to address a thank you to those who are asking, Notre Dame is burning down.  Do I think that it's more than just a coincidence?  I absolutely do.  I believe there, this is... There's something to this.  And I believe the globalists are behind it because we are soon, it's already, the formation is already made.  I believe this Pope, Pope Francis, is the false prophet of Revelation.  I believe that the one world government is being formed.  I believe that President Emmanuel Macron of France has set up and has worked very diligently to set up the army of Antichrist.  There are others in on it.  I find it very interesting that the EU is being urged not to endorse, support, or accept a Middle East peace plan.  Excuse me.  That Donald Trump is that the Trump administration is going to roll out soon.  If it does not, excuse me, support, The Palestinian people or as these high, high ranking former European officials have said, if it doesn't fairly treat the Palestinian people.  And now the  U.S.,  the administration is in talks with these European leaders.  The globalists, it doesn't matter what party you're from, there are globalists on both sides of the spectrum.  And I'm talking to the U.S.  residents right now.  But there are globalists in Israel.  There are globalists that came against the Netanyahu campaign.  Because they want to divide the land.  They are moving and shifting.  The one world government and the one world religion is ready to hit the scene.  Things are about to break loose.  And everything that has needed to happen for the rapture of the church has happened.  Spread the word.  Most of all, spread the gospel of grace.  It is faith alone in Christ alone.  Faith plus nothing equals our salvation and eternal security.  And as I talk to more and more people, there is more hatred and vitriol that comes against those teaching that truth.  What's Paul saying in Galatians 1, 8, and 9?  If you preach a gospel other than that, that person is a curse.  Brothers and sisters, we are in the final moments.  It's an exciting time.  God knew that we would live and breathe and have our being in these most exciting times in church history.  And we have an opportunity to... Share the gospel of grace, the truth with others.  The ABCs, admit you're a sinner in need of a savior.  Believe on the redemptive work of Christ on the cross of Calvary, shedding his precious blood to pay the debt.  It was perfect, whole and complete.  He did it to tell a side.  It is done.  It is finished.  He did it.  He did it on the cross of Calvary.  Once and for all.  And then call on the name of the Lord.  Romans 10, 13.  Those who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Well, I wanted to get on.  And if you didn't know about Notre Dame, you do now.  God bless you guys.  Have an awesome rest of your day. ",
