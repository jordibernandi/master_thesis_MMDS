And to me, my focus as a candidate is solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place and helping move the country forward.  When we're talking about Donald Trump, we are losing, and that includes in the context of impeaching Donald Trump.

And the questions I did get had virtually nothing to do with the core ideas of my campaign.  And if this were an isolated incident, that would be one thing.  But if you go back over the last number of months, MSNBC has literally omitted me from over a dozen fundraising and polling graphics, which it's not about me.  It's about the 300,000 plus Americans who've donated to and support my campaign and the millions of Americans who know we need to rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy to work for us.  Think about those people donating $10, $20 of their hard-earned money to put a candidate on the stage and then have MSNBC virtually ignore me for 32 minutes.  Or when they tune into MSNBC to see how we're doing in the polls, it's like I don't exist.  And you can go through the records.  You can see they've done it to me over and over again.

There are, I'm going to say hundreds, I actually lost track, hundreds of Iowans right behind me, as you can see, who know we need to actually... work on solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected.
