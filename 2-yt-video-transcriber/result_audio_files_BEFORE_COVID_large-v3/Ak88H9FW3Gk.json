            "text": "Greetings, brothers.  I want to let you know that something is happening within the United Kingdom.  Something very powerful is happening right now.  And I'm challenging the black man in particular.  And I'm saying, brothers, we're going to be here, right here in Hyde Park, Speaker's Corner, Marble Arch.  And we're calling on all black men and boys to be present 5.30 p.m.  right here in Hyde Park, Speaker's Corner.  we're going to be here and we have a message to the black man brothers.  it is time that we as a people begin to put ourselves properly on the map of men.  so i'm calling on all black men and black boys hyde park speakers corner this time period that we're living in now.  this is the black man's time right and we've got to make the whole world know unapologetically that it's our time.  unapologetically that's the word.  you know.  there's just too much And we get into too much pseudo type of argument over nothing.  And we've got to be very, very clear.  We put all of these people on the map.  They ride in on our backs.  They use us.  And then they want to treat us like we're boys.  You understand what I'm saying?  It's done, brother.  It has to stop.  The enemy is so wicked that they refuse to relinquish their hold and the oppression on the people.  And so until the people throw them off, it continues.  We study the scripture.  Sometimes when we read about Abraham and Moses and all of the great patriarchs, we imagine them as being old men with long beards.  But if we read the scriptures carefully, we see that they were always youth.  These are young men when they started out.  Musa and all of them were young men.  But my point is that the enemy is always after the youth.  And it's unfortunate.  what they've done is that they've given the young people the idea that they don't need the African tradition of old men for counsel, young men for war.  And so the reason why our young people are now fighting and killing one another on the level that it is, is because there's no guidance.  There's a separation.  If we are believers Allah says the enemy plans, but Allah plans, and Allah is the best of planners.  See brother?  As people of faith, we must understand, brother, that Allah has all of this in his hands.  5.30 p.m.  right here in Hyde Park, Speaker's Corner, where we're going to be throwing down the message to the black man.  And we want black men and black boys to be right here with us, standing firm to send a message to enemy and friend alike.  that the black man is here to stay and that we have our own agenda and our own independent thought process.  So brothers, I'm looking forward to meeting you and seeing you right here, Hyde Park, Speaker's Corner, 5.30, power. ",
