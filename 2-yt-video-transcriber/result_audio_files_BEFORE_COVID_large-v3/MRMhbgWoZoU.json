            "text": "People have wanted me to comment on the whole Brie Larson thing since she started really pissing people off months ago.  I recall seeing headlines, something real wild, where she was like, Miss Marvel isn't for straight, white, heterosexual males.  And I thought to myself, that has to be one of the dumbest statements I ever heard.  Oh, sorry, Captain Marvel.  I just still remember Miss Marvel.  Before she transitioned to being Captain Marvel with the new Marvel movement.  What was it?  Marvel Now or something?  Where they really decided to go with that whole woke angle and it just killed the Marvel Universe.  I don't know who the hell had that idea.  Let's take all the years of canon and throw it out the fucking window.  Just toss it out.  Let's try and make the Marvel comics more like the movies and make them more socially aware.  Hmm.  Ask me about my feminist agenda.  I said, ask me about my wallet because you're not getting any money out of it, you fuckers.  Basically, Marvel was good up until the secret invasion.  And I'm not even going to get into Marvel Comics and talk about the Avengers movies because we'll be here all day.  They're out of fucking order chronologically, but I'm going to let it go because I'm a man of peace and love now.  Did I curse yet?  I probably did.  I was trying not to.  See, I don't have control over it.  It is the will of God.  So after that, Brie Larson just downward spiraled into a pit of becoming probably the most hated female actress ever.  I can't think of any other chick in movies.  people hate this much.  I don't even know much about her and I don't like her, which is weird.  It's just kind of like, how do you do that?  You do that when you lack self-awareness.  That's what you get.  That's what you fucking get, bitch.  And my God, if there's one thing modern women lack, it's self-awareness.  I will now watch this, what is this, Entertainment Tonight?  I don't even know what it is.  It's the Avengers Endgame crap.  You know where all the Avengers run around and talk about the movie without talking about the movie?  Ooh, don't spoil Endgame.  How can I spoil it?  You've already done so.  Marvel's already told you what movies are coming out next.  I think I've got a clear idea of what happens.  I'm not going to say it because people get pissed.  Not that I saw the movie.  But if you can't tell what happens at Endgame, my God, your foresight is horrible.  You should have watched Thundercats.  Sword of Omens, give me sight beyond sight.  That's where you learn how to get sight beyond sight with Lionel. ",

Robert Downey Jr.  did it, for God's sakes.

You'd probably do a real good job because, frankly, I would just be myself and curse a whole lot less.  Except, uh, you probably should have cast me as Spider-Man maybe ten years ago.

No.  Let me tell you what Robert Downey Jr.  was doing before Iron Man.  He was in Elton John music videos.  I want love.  But, needless to say, he was humble enough to at least go to the comic book stores and buy Iron Man comics and try and learn about Tony Stark, for God's sakes.  I can't find the photos of him going through a comic book store, and I don't care to Google it.  Brie Larson got the role for Captain Marvel.

Basically, he just told you a lot of established characters are going to die in the Avengers.  And it's going to be head up by Ms.  Marvel later on.  So whatever.  I don't care.  Personally, I'm glad.  I like this.  Good.  Let the Marvel superhero movies focus around people like Brie Larson so it can finally die.  And I can finally get away from those filthy casuals who sit there and talk to me about Marvel because they watch the movies.  And I'm like, please go away.  I was on the Infinity War before you even knew who the fuck Thanos was.  Get out of my face, you disgust me.  Away with you before I beat you in the face with my life-size Silver Surfer board.  The fact that Silver Surfer isn't in the Infinity War.  Oh my God, my brain.  Where the hell's Adam Warlock?  Let it go, Gundam.  Let it go, you comic book geek.  The X-Men aren't even in this shit, for God's sakes.  Wolverine, not in the Infinity War.  Blasphemy.  It almost seems like, you know, to be real though, as a guy who makes jokes all the time, behind every joke there's truth.  Like, for instance, when I joke about sexting a robot.  That's true.  It happened last night.  I knew she was a robot, but I figured, eh, it's the hottest piece that's come after me in a while, so I'm going to take this for all I can.  If he's sending me free naked photos, why not pretend? ",

Like literally, there was a woman who was admitted to the hospital at the end game because she couldn't stop crying.  I'm sorry if I sound truly lethargic or burnt out, but it's just like I have to come to the realization that I live in a day and age now where people care so much about characters in movies and television that they have mental breakdowns and have to be admitted to a hospital.  You know what?  You could have knocked the bitch out with a plank.  It would have stopped her from crying.  Then when she woke up, she would have been fine if she didn't have a concussion.  I hate forcing myself to watch something that isn't fun and I don't care about.  You know, it's like, great, we see Brie Larson be egotistical.  Lottie friggin' da.  This isn't new for me.

            "text": "Are you fucking kidding me?  So Brie Larson is under the idea that her movie broke the glass ceiling that kept women from leading franchises.  What?  What?  Aliens?  Ripley is probably like the greatest female protagonist in a movie I've ever seen.  In my opinion, there hasn't been a chick that did a movie that came off like Ripley.  You know, just so badass.  You know, she just she was it.  Frankly, Miss Marvel, when I think of Miss Marvel, I don't think of anything.  If you know what I mean, it's kind of like.  Nothing is like, oh, yeah, that movie that we'll forget about next year until like Disney goes see the Miss Marvel to trailer Captain Marvel.  Forgive me.  And I'll still sit there and think.  They're still beating that dead horse, huh?  I mean, it was a movie that was so beloved by the fans that Rotten Tomatoes had to change around everything they did because it got so review-bombed.  Now, I didn't save any of the Twitter crap going on back at the time, even though I thought it would be video-worthy.  Just seeing all of these sort of social justice types saying it was all men.  Oh, and the Mary Sue was in the mix, too.  They're like, it's only men downvoting the movie.  Then, like, people started showing screen caps from women saying the movie was mediocre, too.  It's basically the Mary Suter's Breitbart for feminists.  Let's see.  Women leading franchises.  Star Trek Voyager comes to mind.  Captain Janeway, for God's sakes.  Xena, Warrior Princess, was huge for a long time.  She was huge.  I don't want to say the Resident Evil movies because they sucked.  I mean, people liked Alice, but they sucked.  Oh, Kill Bill.  That was three movies, wasn't it?  Or was it two?  I can't even remember.  The only movie Uma Thurman has ever done that I liked, for God's sake, she has freakish feet.  Brie Larson talks as if these movies and characters never existed.  None of this happened until she came into the fold.  Essentially, in Brie Larson's mind, she's a Time Lord.  That's a complete lack of self-awareness.  Let's see what else is there.  There's that badass one-armed chick in Mad Max, but she wasn't the lead.  But she was badass.  There's no question of that.  Wait a minute.  What about the Wonder Woman movie that came out and everybody loved?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Now that I'm actually sitting here thinking, it's kind of like, what the fuck is Brie Larson talking about?  Now, there was the Laura Crofts movies.  Those sucked, though.  Thank God for Brie Larson.  If it wasn't for her, movies and TV shows wouldn't know that it was all right to have a female lead.  Don't pay any attention to the Wonder Woman that came out.  That didn't really exist.  It was all in your mind.  Good.  I'm glad this is over.  Fuck, Entertainment Tonight, even when I was a little boy, was a piece of crap.  Oh, Maleficent.  I forgot about that movie.  And you know what?  I'm ending the video here, simply because I cannot stand watching this any further.  I was going to do the Brie Larson Wired video, but maybe I'll just leave people to check out the podcast when we talk about it for five seconds.  I really can't take anymore.  I apologize.  This interview is so boring.  It's not even funny.  It's hard to make a comedic commentary out of something that is just such a boring train wreck.  It is the slowest car crash in human history. ",
