An Oregon woman is suing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, LDS.  God, their name is so long.  I really wish they'd shorten it, but... Every single time I talk about them, they've made their name even longer and they get legit offended if you don't use the long form one.  An Oregon woman is suing the church.  They're suing the LDS church for reporting her husband's confession of committing child sex abuse.  christine johnson is suing the church for 9.54 million dollars after her husband timothy johnson 47 confessed to church leaders that he's had multiple sexual interactions with a girl under the age of 16 and was subsequently arrested and convicted of sexual abuse.  the statesman journal reported the suit was filed in marion county circuit court.  Timothy Johnson, a member of the church in Staten, Oregon, was encouraged by his wife to confess and repent his sins in front of clergy and the official church court after she learned he engaged in inappropriate conduct with a minor, the lawsuit said, according to the newspaper.  that is insane.  this woman is legitimately suing the mormon church for doing the right thing.  she's suing the mormon church for doing the right thing.  okay we've been talking about catholics and jehovah's witnesses and every other religion under the sun doing the wrong thing with on these issues for how many decades?  And the Mormon church does the right thing here and gets sued for it.  This is absolutely mind-blowing.  Now, this is one of the things that seriously bothers me about lawyers, okay?  Lawyers are not all bad.  I'm sure we all recognize that.  But for some reason... They always come up with the most disgusting, messed up defenses of the most crooked things.  So let's see what defense this woman's lawyer, or what prosecution, I guess, this woman's lawyer is giving.  He was not told in advance that if he confessed, the clergy would report the incident to authorities.  Bill Brandt, the family's attorney, told DeHill that the church's clergy violated the long-established privilege between it and church members.  He criticized the church for not informing Timothy Johnson that such a confession would be reported and added that confidentiality is key in confessionals, comparing it to the Catholic Church's practice.  The priest can't say, boy, that's terrible.  I'm going to go tell the police, he said.  So there are a lot of laws on the books.  I am not a lawyer, so I... You know, you shouldn't take my word for how the laws operate, but my understanding of the situation is, in most states, there is a protection where a priest can't be prosecuted for not telling the police about something like this during a confession.  That does not mean, however, that the priest is legally barred from telling the police about something.  there is a distinct difference there.  the article says it would shut down their system.  he added saying the church tends to handle issues internally.  oh okay.  so telling the police about a criminal act would shut down the system.  What use is the system if it's not reporting these crimes?  It's so completely useless to me.  Why do I give a shit if the pedophile down the street reports it to his clergyman if the clergyman isn't going to tell anybody else?  I don't care about your stupid system.  Like, it's completely irrelevant to me.  I want societal protection.  That's what I'm after.  It's just the fact that the lawyer even said that is so completely mind-blowing to me.  That's seriously something I would expect to hear from the lawyers of Jehovah's Witnesses' mouth or the lawyers of the Catholic Church's mouth.  It would shut down the system if we started reporting to police.  You've got to be kidding me.  I'm sorry.  I just don't want these people... to feel like their secrets are safe in society.  I don't want them to feel like their secrets are safe with absolutely anybody.  They shouldn't be.  These crimes should be reported to the police.  Bottom line, and the gall of this woman to sue the Mormon Church for doing the right thing is absolutely disgusting to me.  Good for the Mormon Church for doing that, though.  If this woman wins this lawsuit, I'm gonna be upset.  Because that is... giving negative consequences to positive actions.  What church would be willing to report these criminal acts to the police in the future, knowing that they might have to pay an awful lot of money for doing so, and they have protections if they don't?  That is absolutely wrong.  Timothy Johnson was arrested in 2017 on charges of sodomy, sexual abuse, and unlawful sexual penetration and pleaded guilty to four counts of second-degree sexual abuse, leading to a 15-year prison sentence.  Good.  Glad that dude is sitting in prison right now.  The attorney said the incident has devastated the family.  Oh, which incident is that?  Was it the incident where he had his crime reported to the police?  Is that the incident you're talking about?  Or is it the incident that he committed?  Is it the crime that broke up the family?  They're trying to put the blame on the Mormon church in this case.  The blame rests solidly on this pedophile's shoulders.  It's his fault.  his family is fucked up now, not the Mormon church's fault.  They did the right thing.  Here I am defending Mormonism.  Did you ever think you'd see the day?  The attorney said the incident has devastated the family with the lawsuit saying the clergy caused the family to be deprived of his companionship.  No, he deprived his family of his companionship by committing a crime.  Caused the family to be deprived of his companionship, society, love, and income, according to the newspaper.  What a fucking joke, man.  What a joke, man.  I can't believe this woman is even trying this.  Like, what a crooked situation.  The lawsuit reportedly quoted the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the works of Scripture in the LDS Church, as saying, \"...behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.  By this ye may know, if a man repenteth of his sins, behold, he will confess them and forsake  them.\".  Yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but that's not how society works.  I'm sorry.  That's how your religion works.  That's not how society works.  And this dude lives in society, and he has to follow society's rules.  And he broke society's rules, and he's paying for it now.  That's just how it is.  And that's how it should be, honestly.  This is a good law, and it's designed to protect people from other people like this woman's husband.  I'm glad that this law exists, and I'm glad that this dude is sitting in prison right now.  Because it honestly does not sound good, what he did.  Eric Hawkins, a spokesperson for the church... Oh my god, there's that fucking name again.  A spokesperson for the LDS church told The Hill in a statement that protecting victims is a top priority for the church.  Good.  I'm glad to hear that, and I'm glad to see that they're living up to that in this one case.  The church teaches that leaders and members should fulfill all legal obligations to report abuse to civil authorities, he said.  In some circumstances, those obligations may be governed by their professional duty and in others by their role as clergy.  hawkins added that the church has a 24-hour abuse helpline.  we are grateful for the efforts of law enforcement and prosecutors to investigate and pursue justice for those who were abused.  he said in the statement what an absolutely disgusting situation to find myself defending the mormon church is an absolutely bizarre situation.  i have to tell you honestly.  it says here hawkins added that the church has a 24-hour abuse helpline.  um Why?  Why does the church have that shit?  They should be calling the police.  They should just be contacting the police directly.  I don't need a Mormon church abuse hotline or anything else.  Just go with the police or secular abuse hotlines that exist.  Like, they want to find themselves completely separated from society as much as they possibly can.  I'm sorry, you live in society.  That's just how it is.  You have to follow certain laws.  You have to follow certain rules.  There are certain things that you have to do as a member of society.  Reporting abuse to the police is one of those things.  As I said, glad the Mormon church did the right thing in this case.  Maybe this is a sign that other religions may be folding.  Not holding my breath on it, but one can hope. ",
