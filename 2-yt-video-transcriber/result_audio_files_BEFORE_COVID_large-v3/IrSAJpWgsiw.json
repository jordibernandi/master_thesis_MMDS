            "text": "Alright, what's up everyone?  It's PigPuncher back with another commentary video.  So I know a lot of you are probably thinking, what the hell?  PigPuncher making commentary videos again?  I thought you moved to a live format.  Well, you'd be right.  But lately my dog has been having some health problems which have required me to tend to her quite often, and because of this, I don't think I can confidently livestream for long uninterrupted periods of time.  In light of this, I've decided to take a short break from streaming politics to focus on this prepared content I can make in several different sessions, rather than having to sit down in front of a camera and talk for several hours on end.  However, I will still be going on Vosh's stream to play Dungeons & Dragons every Monday night, and I'll also still be streaming the Big Tanka podcast every Friday night.  With all of that said, let's get into the topic of today's video.  So when you think of the biggest right-wing reactionary grifters on this hell site we all call home, some of the worst offenders that come to mind may include NoBullshit, who puts out daily videos where he rants about SJWs and brown people ruining his favorite media over stock footage of ponds and rivers and stuff, while his extremely inaccurate fursona stands in the foreground.  Who would ever think a format like that's a good idea?  Or you may think of Geeks and Gamers, who's known for making over 100 videos on Brie Larson, where he sits in front of his camera and rants about how she's basically the devil incarnate.  No, I'm not talking about either of these assholes.  Instead, I'm talking about what might as well be their offspring if they could somehow have a baby together.  This YouTuber has the intellectual deficiency, neckbeard, and bad hygiene of no bullshit, as well as the lazy, breakneck bullshit format and upload rate of geeks and gamers.  We're talking about the quartering.  No doubt many of you guys already know who The Quartering is.  He has over 600,000 subscribers on his main YouTube channel, and he uploads two to three videos per day.  To be fair, not every single one of these videos is reactionary in nature, but obviously his most popular content is, and his channel does best in terms of viewership when he focuses on ranting about SJWs in front of his camera.  This guy is kind of a mess, and I almost don't know where to begin when discussing him, so let's start at the beginning.  The quartering, or known by his real name, Jeremy Hambly, first came into the spotlight in June of 2017, after he was banned from several Magic the Gathering events due to allegations of harassment by a cosplayer named Christine Sprankle.  Shortly after, he uploaded a video called Playset of Beta White Knights Prevent Rape of MTG Cosplayer at CS Spranklerun, which has since been removed by YouTube, where he claims that Sprankle was lying about the harassment she had received in order to make more money through her Patreon.  Shortly after this video went live, Sprinkle announced she was quitting Magic the Gathering due to the onslaught of hate she was receiving from the Quartering's now-budding fanbase.  After this development, the official Magic the Gathering Twitter made a statement saying that they were sad to see Christine go and they condemned the harassment being sent her way by the MTG community.  Now, let's skip forward a couple of years to when the Quartering began to gain some serious online prominence.  He began making daily videos discussing developments in industries such as gaming, tabletop games, movies, and TV shows.  However, it didn't take long for the Quartering's anti-progressive politics to infect the content he made.  He went from criticizing EA for its anti-consumer business practices to harping on game developers for being SJWs that are supposedly pushing a progressive agenda in their art, while simultaneously strawmanning the arguments of progressives who make the case that maybe games should try to be more inclusive.  So far, this all seems pretty by-the-books for a conservative YouTuber who makes anti-SJW content, but as his channel grew, he became even less respectable in regards to his tactics.  He began to cut down on the editing quality of his videos and opted to begin uploading several videos per day instead.  He started jumping on bandwagons such as the anti-Brie Larson train, which led him to make a few dozen videos on her as well.  all the while injecting even more extreme right-wing politics into his videos.  as time went on.  It didn't take long for lefties on YouTube to notice the Quartering's success and his stupidity, and they quickly began to cover his videos in responses and live takedowns.  Eventually, the Quartering got into a Twitter argument with a streamer named Destiny, and he challenged Destiny to debate him on stream, which he gladly accepted.  Destiny did a preparation stream where he watched a bunch of the Quartering's videos, and he had nearly 12,000 viewers the whole time.  However, once Jeremy saw how prepared Destiny was, he ducked out of the debate and posted these tweets claiming that he never actually intended to debate Destiny and it was all just a big troll.  You know those videos where dudes waste tech scammer's time?  Destiny spent the entire stream watching my videos for 10,000 people or so.  I, of course, never intended on going, but seriously, thank you for the exposure, smiley face.  At Destiny.  Have a great weekend, dude.  The salt in this thread is fucking amazing, smiley face.  This obviously got him into hot water, and he was pressured by Twitter to actually debate Destiny like he said he would.  The date of the debate came, and despite all the strong statements Jeremy had made in his videos and on Twitter, he backpedaled basically every point Destiny confronted him with, and came out of the debate looking like a grifting coward with no actual conviction or good arguments to back up his points.  Not too long after this, yours truly covered a couple of The Quartering's videos on stream, and went on with my life.  However, a few days later, I was doing a weekly call-in stream with my fans when The Quartering himself came into my chat, demanding a debate.  I was caught off guard, but at the time, I was a much smaller channel, and I wasn't going to give up a chance to debate such a large public figure.  He joined my fan discord and we started a debate.  The first thing I noticed was that he was also streaming and his fans were flooding into my chat by the hundreds, spamming the n-word and things like, Hitler did nothing wrong and gas the Jews.  But let's be honest, none of us was surprised that his fan base is full of Nazis.  I started bringing up issues that I had with him and, like with Destiny, he started to backpedal.  For example, he claimed that lesbian, gay, and bisexual people don't have it all that hard in society today compared to straight people.  After I brought up a few studies and articles proving that false, he backpedaled on that point.  However, when debating the black experience in America, he started to engage in a tactic that I've noticed a lot of reactionaries engaging in lately, virtue signaling.  You've probably heard this word used by reactionaries quite often, though ironically, they're the ones who seem to engage in it most often in debate.  I attempted to explain socioeconomics to him, and I tried to illustrate for him that statistically, a friend of his who is black would have had a much harder time growing up than a friend of his that is white.  Before I could even finish this point, he interjected saying, well, for starters, I would never call him my black friend.  I would call him Kyler.  Yeah, I'm not joking.  That is word for word what he said.  This weird jab that I suppose is meant to imply that I and other leftists are the real racists for acknowledging the struggle of black people in America stands in stark contrast of his tendency to mock, condemn, or even become infuriated at representation of races besides white people being included or even praised in media.  Sadly, my stream faced some technical difficulties shortly after this, and I was forced to restart my computer to get the stream working again.  But I was able to reschedule our debate for that.  next Friday, and the day before the debate, I did a research stream where I gathered exact points I wanted to touch on.  However, when Friday came, he stopped responding to my DMs, and so did all of his moderators.  After a few days, I realized that he had no interest in actually debating again, and that he only agreed to reschedule to look good in front of his stream.  Sure enough, a month later, I was streaming some World of Warcraft.  At the time, I was much smaller, and I only had about 10 viewers.  But then he came into my chat and started gloating that he never planned on actually doing the debate in the first place, and just like that, he was gone again.  But the news of this spread around BreadTube, and his nickname of The Quivering started to take hold.  This wasn't the only time that in the heat of the moment, the Quartering would agree to a debate when everyone is looking, only to duck out once the hype has died down.  A bit after our debate, he agreed to debate a YouTuber named Big Joel.  However, right before the day they scheduled for their debate, he ducked out in their DMs.  Unfortunately for Jeremy, Big Joel had a much bigger reach than me, and when he told everyone what the quartering had done, he felt pressure to reschedule the debate and follow through to save his public image.  When the debate finally did happen, it was what you would expect.  Jeremy backpedaled on a lot of points.  And when he wasn't backpedaling, he used fake definitions for words such as homophobia.  In one instance during this debate, Jeremy claims that he can't be homophobic because he doesn't have any rational fear of gay people.  Sadly, Big Joel was not used to live format debates, and seeing all the racism and homophobia in the quartering's chat made him pretty nervous, so he didn't exactly perform as well as he would have liked.  As you can see, the Quartering has a tendency to challenge people to debates when there's a lot of attention and social credit to gain from it, but quickly cancels them when the attention is moved elsewhere and he thinks he can get away with his dignity intact.  Obviously, this had backfired on him a few times, such as with Destiny, but his reputation among reactionaries has still remained quite positive.  The Quartering is a very special, very dangerous kind of bigot.  One with a massive audience who makes racist, homophobic, transphobic, and even misogynistic propaganda, but when challenged on it, he plays dumb and acts like he doesn't know what he's doing, and that the people who are calling him out are just overreacting.  In one video, he says that leftists just call anyone who disagree with them racists, while, in the next video, ranting that white genocide is real in the form of redheads supposedly being erased from the media.  He also claims that he can't be held responsible for the actions of his audience when people bring up the staggering amount of Nazis and white supremacists in his fanbase.  However, we aren't quite done.  The Quartering is many things, a racist, a homophobe, a misogynist, and a propagandist, but he's also a grifter, as I say in the title of this video.  When you watch his video, he seems quite self-aware that he does this just to make money, with no regard for the actual effects of the ideas he's putting out there.  Jeremy sometimes even uses this self-awareness as a comedic element in his videos.  For example, when the new female Thor movie was announced, he started his rant with a skit of him googling how much it costs to build a moat around his house, clearly referencing the fact that he plans to milk this movie for every penny he can.  It's very strange to me how few people in the YouTube community call this out.  These are literal Paul Brother levels of scumminess, but instead of telling six-year-olds to steal their parents' credit card to buy his merch, he's exploiting the bigoted outrage of his audience for profit.  Although, this isn't the only way he scams his audience.  Last year, Jeremy announced he was creating a website called ExclusivelyGames.com.  The website would be an independent platform for creators.  he would pay to upload reviews of games that are politics-free.  Their goal is to keep agendas out of games and, quote, These reviews are obviously not politics-free, as all art is inherently political.  And video games are, in fact, art.  And with reactionaries writing most of these reviews, I have no doubt that a lot of them reference the evil of the SJW agenda.  The reason I brought up this website, though, is how Jeremy decided to pay for it.  He started by creating an Indiegogo campaign with a startup goal of $200,000, with a bonus goal of 250 grand, which, if they reached, he'd shave his beard and rock a creepy stash.  Ugh.  He claimed that this would be enough to keep the site up for a year.  This would presumably include paying the reviewers, paying the servers, site domain, and other related services.  However, if you look at their goal milestones, you start to see that something is clearly wrong here.  For starters, he asks for $10,000 to start up the social media channels like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.  This should already raise a few red flags.  He goes on to list the rest of the milestones, many of them being ridiculously overpriced.  At one point, he even wrote the same goal three times just to take up space on the list.  The best part is, once the campaign reached a certain point, he just stopped updating the goals.  As you can see, the campaign is at just short of $160 at the time of me writing this, but he has only updated the milestones up to $100,000.  I'll let you, the viewers, decide why that is.  On top of that, the site has a monthly voluntary subscription service that is making $3,000 to $4,000 a month.  For those of you that can't already tell, this website is heavily overfunded.  At most, .com domains typically cost around $15 a year.  Most web designers are willing to work for a small percentage of the revenue generated by the site, or a reasonable flat rate, and I can't imagine the reviewers are being paid a very big salary for uploading to this site when most of them already have their own successful YouTube channels.  Something about the amount Jeremy raised certainly seems fishy, especially when you consider that this $200,000-plus goal is annual.  They expect to make nearly $250,000 a year in order to keep this website up.  Something is clearly wrong here.  Funnily enough, Jeremy was one of the people who was complaining about feminist game critic Anita Sarkeesian raising way too much money than she could possibly need for her series Tropes vs.  Women in Video Games, when he's possibly done something arguably worse here.  There are plenty more things I could list about this guy, but the video's gotten too long already.  Instead, I'll leave links to other videos from YouTubers who've also covered the quartering, and I'll let you guys learn from them as well.  In conclusion, Jeremy Hambly is a racist, a misogynist, a transphobe, and an overall bigot who exploits the YouTube algorithm and extorts his audience for money.  He challenges people to debates when it makes him look cool, but cowers and quivers when people aren't looking, and he truly may be YouTube's biggest grifter.  Anyway guys, thank you so much for watching.  For those of you guys who are used to live format, this may seem really strange to you, but I promise I will get back to streaming when my circumstances allow me to.  For those of you who are new and just found me through this video, uh, hello, please subscribe.  I make all sorts of cool videos, and I want to hit at least 15,000 subscribers by New Year's.  I honestly think we can do it, so thank you to anyone who likes and shares this video to help it get seen by new people.  I've made commentary videos like this before, but none of them were ever this in-depth and comprehensive.  Please let me know in the comments if you guys like this video, and if you like this format.  If you do, I'm thinking of covering Calvin Gara and Blair White next.  I also have links to my Twitter, which I highly recommend you follow, my fan Discord, where you can talk to me and other fans, as well as my website, where you can watch me stream live games and politics, in the description down below.  Anyway guys, thank you so much for watching.  PigPuncher, out. ",
