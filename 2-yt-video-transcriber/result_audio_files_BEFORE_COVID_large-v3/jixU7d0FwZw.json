            "text": "Okay, so recently I got a laryngoscope done on me.  They stick a camera up your nose and then lower it down the back of your nose into your pharynx and then we can look at the vocal folds and all the surrounding structures.  So let's take a look.  First off, we're inside my nose right here.  This is my soft palate or my velum.  This is at the very back and up of my nose where your nasopharynx starts.  And there we can see that the velum opens, aka the soft palate lowers, which opens up airflow into the nose.  You always lower this when you breathe through your nose.  And then we're just gonna stick the camera back, the back of my nose, and then we are now in the pharynx.  This structure here is the back of your tongue.  This is the tongue root.  This right here is the epiglottis.  We can actually see the vocal folds are down there.  This is your trachea.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Whenever you breathe, there should be symmetric motion here.  So that's what this test is checking.  And everything looks good.  This footage is a little bit more interesting.  So in this footage, we sort of look at some vocal function.  These right here are the vestibular folds.  The true folds, the vestibular folds.  I'm changing my glottal quotient there.  Let's look at that again.  I try and do the same thing, but for a really high note.  It's kind of hard to do that really, really open.  But I try.  So he asked me if there's anything I want to do that I wanted to see.  And I was kind of caught off guard because there's a lot of stuff that I want to do.  But since I had a camera in my nose, it was kind of hard to like.  It was really hard to like determine exactly what I wanted.  Right.  So I raised my larynx while you do this.  So I asked him if I could raise my larynx and he said yes.  And I was like, whoa, that was really fast.  So I do it a little bit slower.  And this is so exciting to see.  We see here the tongue root is coming back.  We see that the epiglottis ends up curvy and going all the way back here and the larynx is shifting up.  Wow.  Thank you.  I'm like, wow.  Tongue root?  And then I asked them for the tongue root because something that's really, really important is the structure of the tongue during feminization.  And I was gonna try and do this without raising the larynx too much.  And we can actually see some of this, see?  We can see the tongue root retracting back here.  We're looking down from the very back of the nose, down the nasopharynx.  This is the oropharynx back here.  There's the pharynx and then down here is the larynx.  And we can actually see the tongue root retracts.  Now, I think I talk here and you can actually see how when I speak, Ooh, this is actually really, really feminized.  This is like, ah, ah, like a really, really tiny structure.  Ooh, ooh.  Awesome.  So there's a word.  Let's look at the word awesome.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Now, I had a camera down my throat, but look at my tongue retraction here.  Awesome.  Thank you.  Right, and then he pulls the scope out, of course, and we go through my nose and so forth.  Okay, so I just wanted to go over a little bit of that once more where things started to get a little bit more interesting.  Will you do this?  Or will I?  Okay.  So I have a thing up my nose.  We are looking down from the nose.  We can actually see I raised the larynx really high at first and everything shoots up.  So he has to like pull the camera back, right?  So we lose vision.  Now I realize I can't quite go as high with it.  Wow, thank you.  And then the tongue group?  And I want to give a really special thanks and shout out to Dr.  James Thomas for capturing all these awesome images with his scope.  So yeah, thanks so much for watching.  I hope you find this interesting.  Post below what you think about this stuff.  Did you think it looked like this?  Do you have any questions about any of the anatomy stuff?
