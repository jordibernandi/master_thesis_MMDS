            "text": "All esteem to the Most High Elohim.  All praise to the Ancient of Days.  This is your brother El, introducing to you all a new project of ours, the Book of War.  The scripture says that the Most High is a man of war.  That's written in Exodus chapter 15.  And this life that we live, it's warfare.  The scripture tells us that we must be able to endure hardness as a soldier.  The scripture says that the most high has no pleasure in the soul that shrinks back.  All the metaphors about warfare are seen all throughout the scripture.  Our people, the children of Israel, we had to go to war in order to inherit our promised land.  It just was not given to us.  We had to go to war for it.  Everything about this life, enduring to the kingdom, the battles of life, as it says in 2nd Ezra, that this is the battle that every man born on earth must fight.  Everything is warfare, mental warfare, spiritual warfare, physical warfare.  So we put together this project where we've gone throughout scriptures to all the places where our people fought and had victory.  This particular project is all about meditating on the victories of our people.  It's a five hour long audio book for those of you that have loved and appreciated the other projects we've done.  you will also appreciate this one.  I was inspired to do this audio book because I remember several years ago, whenever I first read the book of Jasher, chapters 37 through 40 about the wars of the sons of Jacob.  I had never heard or seen nothing like that before.  How it was going into so many details about how Judah, Levi, Simeon, all those brothers were mighty in warfare.  It talked about how they were leaping over castle walls and slaying 150, 200 people at one time.  Family, when I read that for the first time, my spirit got so charged up.  I had to go run like seven or eight miles at the park and hit the gym and lift just to get that energy and that stamina out that I felt just from hearing those warfare scriptures.  So we put together a project like this because I want you brothers and sisters to have that same charge as you listen to all the stories of warfare.  conquest of our people and just meditate on those victories until so to the point.  it gives you power for you to fight and war to get victories in your life just like your ancestors got on their battlefields.  All the warfares that you can think of in the scripture are in here.  The wars of the Messiah that he will soon fight from second Ezra's chapter 12 and 13 and revelation chapter 19, the wars of King David, the wars of the sons of Jacob, the wars of Deborah, the wars of Esther, the wars of all the mighty men and women in scripture.  It's five hours of nothing but war fair scriptures and stories of conquest, overcoming and victory.  Not only are all the wars that our people fought and won in this one audio book, but also warfare scripture after warfare scripture after warfare scripture.  All the scriptures about conquering from the book of Psalms to Romans chapter eight, where Paul says we are more than conquerors.  all the way to the book of Ecclesiasticus where it says that we must fight for the truth until the death and the most high will fight for us.  All the scriptures about battle, warfare, overcoming, victory, triumph.  All the epic battles of our people are in this one audio book narrated by myself, narrated from the King James Version.  As y'all know, we don't use any of the pagan names in any of our audio books.  But this right here, five hours of straight fire content, all focused on warfare, all focused on the histories and the conquest of our people, and also the future prophetic wars that have yet to take place.  Those wars are narrated in this audiobook as well.  So, this is for the conquerors.  This is for the winners.  This is for those who just want to meditate and have their mind on victory and overcoming.  In these times, it gets to the point You can get drained if you're not careful, if you're not cautious and guarding your ear gate and eye gate, constantly looking at these stories of some of our people taking losses, constantly getting caught up in what's going on around you and in your life.  This will help you.  just sit still and meditate on victories and feed your spirit and your mind with stories of victory, dominance, superiority, authority, overcoming, winning.  Listen to this audio book and get your spirit and mind filled up with that victory charge to charge your spirit.

Check out the link in the description box for those who are interested in that.  I know for a fact that this will be a blessing to those out there who are looking for things to give you that energy and that boost that you need in life.  Because life is warfare.  And as the Messiah said in Revelation, blessed is he who overcomes.  So let us endure and win.  Shalom. ",
