            "text": "Turn it up to a full side of cam.  Sure?  Yeah.  Oh my fucking god.  Well, maybe that was a little too hard.  So I've got to admit I took a little bit of vicarious pleasure in watching Elon Musk's glorious release of his cyber track with the absolutely indestructible bulletproof glass which was completely smash resistant and sure.  yeah oh my god.  well maybe that was a little too hard.  oh i i'm sure the first one was just bad luck.  should we try the second one?  let's try the right.  try that one really okay.  oh man it didn't go through.  Now, the whole thing's kind of dumb anyway, because who buys a car based on whether the windows smash when you throw metal balls at them?  And in any event, it's kind of a dumb demo, because the thing that determines whether the glass shatters or not is typically if the glass is scratched first.  If the glass is scratched... then it will shatter hundreds to thousands of times easier than if it's not scratched.  And for it to be scratched, it needs to be in contact with something abrasive that's actually harder than glass.  And that's basically not a metal ball.  Sorry, not a steel ball like this.  Steel is softer than glass.  It won't scratch glass.  But if, say, for instance, you had some particles of, I don't know, sand or something, they're actually stuck in to the metal ball, they're almost invisible, then that would be much, much more effective.  breaking through a car window like this because the abrasive stuff would scratch the glass and then the momentum of the ball would actually break the window.  which is why all the little hammers that you have for breaking glass in emergency situations like buses and such, they're all basically a silicon carbide tip or something because you have to scratch the glass and then it just shatters very easily and you can push it out.  Which brings us on to the second maybe obvious thing about why having completely indestructible windows is not necessarily the smartest of things to do.  is if you are in a car crash and you do need to get out, say for instance the battery's on fire or something, how are people gonna get you out when you've got indestructible windows and doors?  Yeah, it's hard enough getting people out of regular cars, which you can just chop up with, you know, the jaws of life, that sort of thing.  I mean, I've seen things like this on other high-end cars, you know, the windows that you just can't break through.  I mean, all they really are is there's like two layers of glass and there's some fairly reinforced plastic in between, which basically means that you can wail on these things forever with a sledgehammer and really not get anywhere.  Which brings us on to the second rather bizarre demo of hitting the door with a large hammer, which I've got to admit, to me, looks like it's plastic coated or something.  but they do a demo first with a regular car door just to show how how this hammer will totally wreck the door and it only like puts minor dents in it and this guy takes a full whack at this thing.  then let's take a look at how hard he hits the cyber truck.  Yeah, it's pretty clear.  I mean, I did some rough analysis.  I reckon that he hit the regular car door about twice as hard as he hit the Tesla car door.  And he also hit it with the corner of the hammer rather than a nice gentle tap with the flat part of the hammer.  thus ensuring the least possible damage done to the Tesla door.  Not that any of this really makes any difference whatsoever, because who buys a truck based on how hard you can hit the doors with a plastic hammer?  I mean, to me, the thing that probably grinds my gears most about Elon Musk is he is a four-star bullshit merchant.  You know, reinventing the vacuum train and just giving it a new name, making it the Hyperloop.  I mean, what are we now?  Eight years on from Elon Musk's white paper where he was going on about how the Hyperloop, it's not really that hard.  It's just like an air hockey table with some fans.  Or, you know, he can't just, like, release a truck.  It's got to be the Cybertruck.  And the other thing that kind of... gives me sort of flashbacks here is he always wants to say there is some great space age technology.  on his new car his new electric vehicle like for instance the he was going to put cold gas thrusters on his new teslas Even though coal gas thrusters were nothing new and putting them on cars was really stupid, he still made a fairly serious effort to say that he was going to do this.  Simply so he could join up... spacex rocket technology with his cars and with this is basically the same thing apart from this time he's using the same metal he uses for his rockets for um his cars and in his really that that.  does that make it any better as a car?  and if you enjoyed that why not drop a like on this video and if you're not done so already subscribe and hit the notification bell And hopefully I'll get around to Elon Musk's latest rocket blowing up tomorrow.
