            "text": "This is madness.  Isn't this insanity?  We have issues that are screaming for government attention, screaming for it.  And we have a Republican leadership that is so used to giving Trump a blow job that they have lost their ability to function as a governing body, the Republican Party in the Senate.  And we have a president who is crazy.  He's out of his fucking mind.  He is giving in to his first neurotic, now psychotic images of what he has to do because there are hordes coming.  There are masses of people.  They're coming.  Trump is terrified of people.  He wants nothing to do with people.  The only time he's comfortable with people is if they are shouting, lock her up.  Two fucking years after the election, they're still screaming this.  These brain-dead sons of bitches that Trump sees as his base.  And even then, watch him sometimes when he's giving one of these speeches, watch his body language.  It's the body language of a man who knows that he's trapped.  While these people are cheering for him and wearing their little fucking red hats and pushing BBC cameramen around, they could also turn on him.  Do you remember the scene in Suddenly Last Summer? ",
