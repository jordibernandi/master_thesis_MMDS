So we're gonna go ahead and go over now, and we're gonna see what happened to that egg.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, man.  No, no.  Horrible.  Gosh, that's it?  Freaking mental health.  The pressure of social media is getting to me.  Puke.  Jeez, this type of stuff, come on, man.  Somebody want to say, oh, but it's a positive message.  It's no.  It could be a positive message.  See, that's what happens when you be knowing too much stuff.  Like, what's going on?  See, what's going to end up happening is people are going to be diagnosed to have mental illnesses when they ain't even got it.  Understand yes, there are people with mental illnesses, but then there are people who ain't got mental illnesses.  It's just gonna be going up there getting checked Just because everybody else getting checked.  and then next thing, you know a bill passed and AB 1968, and this ain't from way back in 1968.  Oh no, this is from now.  This is for right now, this day and age.  If you are involuntarily admitted to a facility for a mental health disorder more than once in a year, then you have a lifetime ban on gun ownership.  Then you cannot use a gun to defend yourself.  What?  Yeah, it's crazy, isn't it?  Even if the other person got a gun.  So they got a gun.  They coming at you.  You can't use a gun.  I don't know what you're going to do.  It's going to be kind of complicated.  And I know what you're saying.  Well, that's just in California.  Yeah, that's just in California now.  See, the way they do things is an increment.  So when I hear stuff like this, oh, mental health screening.  And the argument is, oh, well, this is just for people who are a danger to themselves or others.  Yeah, but who is determining that?  Who is determining your mental health?  They could say, oh, because you believe this and that, you're a dangerous to yourself and others.  And they go over there, ban your means of self-defense with a gun.  And as you crack, the yolk comes out from that there egg.  And we see that the yolk is slippery.  So I guess it does make sense.  We are talking about a slippery slope.  To the whole mental health evaluations, I say no.  And the disappointment comes because I thought it was just going to be some joke.  Something we can all laugh at.  Red Silver J, all I got to say. ",
