Basically, if you hit somebody with it, it's going to be detrimental, let alone the psychological aspects of what you're going to see around it.  I don't think banning ARs is going to solve anything besides the political frenzies that started and everything else.  It's a semi-automatic rifle.  They're very easy to operate.  You can change pretty much anything on them.  and they're very low recoil.  That is why they are so accepted.  You could use it for anything from groundhog hunting, prairie dog hunting, up to coyote hunting.  And anybody that really follows any type of outdoor news in Ohio knows we have a huge coyote problem right now.  We've seen a big upswing in ARs among coyote hunters because of the fact that that 5.56 ammo is cheap, the rifles are cheap, they're low recoil, and they're just easy to operate. ",
