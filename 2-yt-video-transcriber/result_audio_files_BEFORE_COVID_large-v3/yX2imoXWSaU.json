            "text": "What is the Millennial Kingdom, or the thousand year reign of our Messiah on earth?  It's time to UNLEARN the lies.  Hey, welcome to UNLEARN.  My name is Lex and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we UNLEARN the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  Now let's get started.  The reign of Yeshua is a set apart time in which Satan will be bound for a thousand years so that he will no longer deceive the nations.  this will result in a time of peace and holiness on the earth.  he laid hold of the dragon that serpent of old who is the devil and satan and bound him for a thousand years and he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal on him so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished.  Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshipped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands.  And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.  But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished.  This is the first resurrection.  Blessed and holy is he who is part in the first  resurrection.\"  Over such the second death has no power.  But they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years.  Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.  The scripture provides some interesting patterns dealing with time.  God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh.  sending that day apart as holy.  The Sabbath day was given so that everyone could have a day of rest and be refreshed.  Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.  In it you shall do no work, you nor your son nor your daughter, nor your male servant nor your female servant, nor your cattle nor your stranger who is within your gates.  For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested the seventh  day.\".  Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.  The Bible also speaks about a Sabbath of the land, in which we are to work the land for six years, then let the land rest on the seventh year.  When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep a Sabbath to the Lord.  Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather its fruit.  But the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land.  a Sabbath to the Lord.  You shall neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard.  This Sabbath rest for the land not only allowed the earth to rest from tilling and working of the ground, but it also was given as a means to provide for the poor.  But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat.  God also established the release of slaves on the seventh year, saying, If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh year he shall go out free and pay nothing.  This results in righteous treatment of God's people, so that even if they got into a situation of servitude, they had the hope of freedom.  We also find the number seven being significant in the feasts of the Lord.  For example, the Feast of Unleavened Bread and the Feast of Tabernacles both last seven days.  The Feast of Weeks is determined by counting seven Sabbaths, beginning with the day of firstfruits, and all of the fall feasts, trumpets, atonement, and tabernacles take place in the seventh month.  The number seven is used over and over throughout the scriptures, and is always seen as a time of rest, healing, release, peace, and completion.  It seems this pattern of seven is very significant in God's timing of events.  Listen to what the Holman dictionary says about the number seven in scripture.  The seven came to symbolize completeness and perfection.  God's work of creation was both complete and perfect, and it was completed in seven days.  All of mankind's existence was related to God's creative activity.  The seven-day week reflected God's first creative activity.  The Sabbath was that day of rest following the work week, reflective of God's rest.  Israelites were to remember the land and also give it a Sabbath, permitting it to lie fallow on the seventh year.  Seven was also important in the cultic matters beyond the Sabbath.  Major festivals such as Passover and Tabernacles lasted seven days, as did the wedding festivals.  In Pharaoh's dreams, the seven good years followed by seven years of famine represented a complete cycle of plenty and famine.  Jacob worked a complete cycle of years for Rachel, then when he was given Leah instead, he worked an additional cycle of seven.  The Lord tells us the Sabbath is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever.  The word sign is translated from the Hebrew word oath, which means a pledge, a witness, or something wondrous.  A sign is that which points to something else, an object, occurrence, or person through which one recognizes, remembers, or validates something.  Signs are often used to illustrate something that occurs prophetically, which is why prophets would often give signs to confirm their message.  The Sabbath functions as a sign between God and His people forever.  The word forever indicates the eternal promises of God.  Therefore, the Sabbath is linked to the prophetic fulfillment of the eternal kingdom.  We are expected to remember the Sabbath because in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day.  Likewise, the prophet Isaiah tells us to remember the former things so that we can understand the end, explaining that God declares the end from the beginning.  There are things spoken of in the beginning that God has not yet done.  but he will bring them to pass at the appointed time.  Remember the former things of old, for I am God, and there is no other.  I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.  Indeed, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass.  I have purposed it, I will also do it.  Not only are we told to remember the Sabbath day, but we're also shown patterns of the Sabbath in a number of different ways.  There's a Sabbath every seven days, a Sabbath year every seven years, and each of the feasts contain a set apart Sabbath day of rest.  When we take into consideration all of the Sabbaths that are mentioned in the Bible, it's important to note that the Bible tells us that a Sabbath rest remains, therefore, for God's people.  There's one Sabbath that hasn't happened yet, the Sabbath millennium.  According to biblical and historical records and genealogies, The earth is nearing the end of 6,000 years, not billions of years as the evolutionists try to say.  The Bible tells us, Do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.  This means the earth is nearing the end of the sixth day and is about to begin the Sabbath.  This millennial Sabbath was understood by early Christian writers, and they clearly articulated this fact in their writings.  Listen to what one 3rd century theologian had to say on this topic.  And six thousand years must needs be accomplished, in order that the Sabbath may come, the rest, the holy day on which God rested from all his works.  For the Sabbath is the type and emblem of the future kingdom of the saints, when they shall reign with Christ, when he comes from heaven, as John says in his Apocalypse, for a day with the Lord is as a thousand years.  Since then, in six days God made all things.  It follows that six thousand years must be  fulfilled.\".  Not only did early Christian writings contain information about the Millennial Sabbath, but there are also a number of Jewish texts which explain the expectation of a Sabbath for the earth.  Listen to this quote from a Jewish midrash on this topic.  Six eons for going in and coming out, for war and peace.  The seventh eon is entirely Shabbat and rest for life everlasting.  Now I don't endorse the Talmud, and I'm only quoting from it to show this is a common belief among Jews.  With that being said, listen to what the Talmud says on this topic.  6,000 years shall the world exist, and 1,000, the seventh, it shall be desolate, as it is written, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.  Just as the seventh year is one year of release in seven, so is the world.  One thousand years out of seven shall be fallow, as it is written, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.  And it is further said, a psalm and song of the Sabbath day, meaning the day that is altogether Shabbat.  And it is also said, for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when is past.  There has long been an expectation that the seventh millennium would be a Sabbath for the earth.  This thousand year Sabbath is the messianic kingdom in which Yeshua will reign on the earth.  Yeshua is the Lord of the Sabbath and during his reign, Satan will be bound so that the Sabbath will be kept holy.  The Sabbath is a sign between God and his people to set us apart and to show us that we serve the one who created the earth in six days and rested on the seventh.  Moreover, I also gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between them and me.  that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them.  The Sabbath is a shadow of things to come because it gives us a glimpse of the millennial reign of Yeshua.  Each week as we keep the Sabbath, we are participating in the reign of our King, so that when He returns, we will be able to enter into His rest.  Thanks for watching.
