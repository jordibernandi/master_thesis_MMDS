            "text": "Good afternoon, everybody.  This is Steve Fletcher with the Trumpet for My People.  Today is March 3rd, 2019, and I have a very quick update for you.  On February 26th, QAnon gave a warning, a 21-day countdown that within 21 days, big, big things are going to be happening.  Big, big, big happenings are going to take place.  21-day countdown from February 26th.  2019. so let's do the.  let's do the count from February 26th.  21 days brings us to March 19th.  what could possibly be significant about March 19th like here's a warning prepare be ready everyone be ready by March 19th.  March 19th, I want to bring to everybody's attention is the date of the inauguration of the Denver Airport.  Denver Airport plaque is dated March 19th, 1994.  What is the Denver Airport known for?  It is known for Their bunkers, the underground bunkers.  This is the greatest system of underground bunkers covering many, many, many square miles.  I don't have all the details.  We know that within the Denver airport, all the conspiracies that are within the airport itself, plus the bunker system that is underneath the airport, And this is all tied together to the date of March 19th.  So if QAnon is giving a warning, a 21-day warning, big, big, big happenings, everyone be ready within 21 days.  Then we go from February 26th, brings us to March 19th.  We see this connected to the Denver Airport, Denver Airport known for its bunker system, okay?  And let's look at the calendar.  Now if we look at the March calendar, this is the Hebrew calendar, but I'm looking at March.  We see that March 19th is the day before the beginning of Purim.  So basically to the end of Purim, March 19th is a three day warning.  Three day warning.  March 19th lines up exactly with Just before Pierrot.  Okay, I've shared two very important videos about March 22nd.  I actually have many other videos But I've kind of resumed everything.  I've given a summary of everything in the last two videos that I did.  so I will share the links with you of the last two videos that I did and I want to share with everyone that March 19th is a sign of That everyone needs to take cover.  Take cover.  Get into your bunkers.  Be ready.  It's going down.  And Purim.  The end of Purim is 3-2-2.  March 22nd.  The date of the abominations.  The date of skull and bones.  The date of Obamacare.  It's the last day of Purim.  It's the third day of Purim.  The last day of Purim.  The last day of the last feast.  in the last Jubilee, the 70th year of Israel, and it looks like we have arrived at the time where it is going to be going down.  It's ready to go down.  Okay, so I do want to share this one last piece of information with you from the book of Esther, reminding everybody that It was on the third day that Esther entered into the court of the king.  It was on the third day.  Yesterday I shared a wonderful update about the third day and the last day and how a pyramid is the only three day feast from the 13th, 14th and 15th of Adar as written in Esther chapter 9.  We'll see that there are three days set aside for the Feast of Purim.  It's the only three-day feast.  And that in the book of Esther, it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel, stood in the inner court of the king's house.  So we know about the third day.  I think the elite understands also about the third day and them getting ready Three days in advance from the last day of Purim, even within their date of the Denver airport.  March 19th.  Okay, three days before the skull and bones.  Three days before the Georgia Guidestones.  Three days before Obamacare.  Three days before the abomination.  Are you ready for the return of Jesus Christ?  On the third day, Esther entered into the court of the king's house, put on her royal apparel.  So I pray you are blessed today.  This is a quick update.  Take this information and take it to the Lord.  Consider it.  And this 21-day countdown is Revealed.  March 19th head to the bunkers.  Now before I close I want to share one thing here one more thing with you that from last year in 2018 it was actually on March 19th when all the elite started heading to Their bunker.  So let's take a look at what happened on March 19th 2018.  This is a report from the Washington Examiner.  Last year, March 19th, 2018, official Washington flocking to doomsday camps, March 19th, 2018.  A building network of backwards doomsday camps around the country are pulling in members affluent areas and even Washington national security officials as the threats grow from nuclear war an EMP or virus attack.  this report came out March 19th 2018.  I actually shared before the fact that this would be happening based on this date in the Denver airport.  Indeed, it did happen.  This was the date of the report that came out on March 19, 2018.  And I guess before I close, I'll add one more piece of information for you.  The 23rd of March is the day after Piram ends.  is the promised Messiah day for the Muslims.  The promised Messiah day, March 23rd.  So we see that the third day is the day that Esther enters into the court of the king.  She puts on her royal apparel.  And the day to enter the bunkers is march 19th preparing for the third day and preparing for the coming of the muslim messiah on march 23rd.  so a lot is going down a lot is happening there's a lot of information.  i will leave the two links for you of my last two videos.  and uh if you want to get up to date on what i've been sharing about piram The last day, the third day, March 22nd, may your flight not be in winter or on the Sabbath.
