            "text": "What's going on?  Luke from USA Carry here.  I didn't think I'd be doing another video like this so soon, but this one I couldn't pass up.  It seems like y'all liked the Walmart shooting breakdown I did earlier this week.  I'll link to that up here somewhere.  This is a shooting that took place over a bag of chips.  And while this doesn't involve a concealed carrier, there are a few things we can learn from it.  So let's take a look.  All right, so this incident took place in Detroit, Michigan at a Shell gas station this past Tuesday night.  The original footage was kind of cut up weird, so I spliced it up, put it back together.  so you've got one full camera angle, another camera angle, and then the camera outside altogether.  It also had some spots where it was kind of pausing during the video, so I took those out as well.  So this first camera angle is from the entrance of the Shell station, obviously.  This guy here in the blue shirt, he's with the guy that's actually doing the shoplifting.  As you can see when we start this, they're already in an argument with the clerk.  These other two guys that walk in don't seem to be with them.  I think they just walked in while this was all taking place.  Here you can see the guy in the blue, he's yelling at the clerk.  He's holding the door open.  Then you'll see the guy that's actually doing the shoplifting.  come up from the bottom left.  He's wearing a white shirt.  He's yelling at the clerk, he's got a handful of chips, and boom, right there you see the glass on the door shatter.  Now let's rewind and keep your eye on the guy in the blue, because that round goes through the window, hits him in the chest, he doubles over, keep an eye on him, he gets back up, and then he runs off.  which you'll see on the footage outside.  Now let's rewind a little bit and watch this again.  So boom, there's the shot.  The guy's yelling.  He notices friends hitting the chest.  He decides to come back in.  He yells at the clerk but quickly gets out of there because as you'll see in the next camera angle, the clerk raises the gun again and they both take off.  So now here's the camera angle showing the clerk shooting.  Obviously they're in the argument.  He comes out the cashier area with the gun raised, looks like a revolver.  He's pointing it at the guy who doesn't seem to be phased by that.  And actually none of the other innocent bystanders seem to be phased about a guy waving a gun around.  They just kind of stand there and one gets out the way when he actually takes a shot.  So here he is, they're exchanging words, and boom, he decides to take a shot.  That's the shot that hits the door.  That's when the guy comes back.  He raises the gun up, the guy flees, and that's the end of that camera angle.  Now here you can see the footage outside.  That's where the guy that got shot in the chest in the blue, he runs off, he gets his cell phone out, hands it to his friend while he's holding his wound.  I assume to tell him to call an ambulance because he's bleeding out.  And that's the end of the footage that we have.  So is shoplifting worth risking your life over?  Is a guy stealing a few bag of chips worth going to jail for?  I don't think so.  And one thing we can learn from this, which we've talked about in articles before, which I'll probably link one up here, it's let go of your ego and don't let your emotions get the best of you.  It seems like these guys may have had a history before.  Maybe they've done this before to them.  It seems like the clerk just had enough and decided to come out shooting.  Not the best idea.  He should have just let them walk out the door with the chips, call the police, and be done with it.  You also never know how somebody else is gonna react.  What if they had a gun and started shooting back?  You don't know if they're crazy, what kind of mood they're in.  You just don't know how other people are gonna act.  So don't go instigating things.  This also reminds me of an article I read recently about a Walgreens in the neighborhood I used to live in in New Orleans.  Apparently, a customer saw somebody shoplifting, and the manager just let them walk out the front door.  When they asked them about it, they said, yeah, that happens all the time.  Corporate said not to do anything.  Don't try to stop them or anything like that.  They just call the police.  The police show up, file a report, and that's about it.  Apparently, that's the cost of doing business.  Another thing we can look at is, even though this guy shouldn't have been shooting in the first place, he comes out with the gun in one hand and takes a shot, obviously completely missing his target.  His other hand was free, he was standing still, so he could have used two hands to make that shot.  Go out there, get some proper training, practice often.  so if you find yourself in this type of situation, you have some skills to fall back on.  This shot easily could have hit an innocent bystander, a child outside, who knows.  Another thing we can look at is this guy gets hit in the chest, looked like it was a lower left hit.  I don't know what caliber the revolver was, but the guy doubles over, he gets back up, he sprints for a little bit, and then he just walks off.  So it's not like the movies where one shot, boom, he drops like a sack of potatoes.  That's why I was always taught to shoot until the threat is neutralized or there is no longer a threat, because one shot may not do it.  And I'm not going to get into the debate of which caliber is the best.  I'll let you guys do that down in the comments.  Let me know what caliber you prefer for concealed carry.  I prefer 9mm, but that's just me.  And lastly, the clerk takes a shot at this guy as he's walking away.  So if he actually hit his target, he would have hit him square in the back as he was walking away on camera.  That wouldn't have looked good in court.  Not that this is looking good for him either.  Because the clerk is in custody as well as the shoplifter.  The guy that got hit in the chest, he's in the hospital in critical condition.
