Okay, I'm done with this conversation.  Thank you for calling, Darth.  Have a nice day.  Okay, look, if you're a presuppositionalist and you want to have a conversation with me, I'd love to talk to you.  But if you're not going to treat me with the respect that I deserve or my co-hosts deserve in our intellectual capacity to understand what you mean and to think that we haven't studied these issues for several years and have done the work in figuring out what we believe and why we believe.  If you doubt that, then it's not worth talking to us.  Go talk to somebody who you can fool more easily.  Because I'm done with that.  I'm not gonna be tricked into Christianity because you think you have some sort of special proof that if only the atheist mind understood that somehow he'd be a Bible-believing Christian and start telling gay people they're gonna go to hell or some stupid nonsense like that, okay?
