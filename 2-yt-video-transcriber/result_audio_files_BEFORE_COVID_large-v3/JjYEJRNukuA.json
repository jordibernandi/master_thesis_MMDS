            "text": "Hey this is Tyesha and check out my original video on my one year update.  Now we are here for my second year update.  This is where we left off on the last video and I want to thank you for over 100,000 views on that video.  So yes on my second year I was able to play up my hairstyles get a little bit more creative and practice braiding.  I had an issue with braiding my hair so what I did was I washed my hair every weekend and tried a different style.  You can check out my board on Pinterest where I have natural hairstyles and natural hair encouragement.  one thing i added this year for my second year was i started taking collagen because i found it was important to put inside my body things that would help me glow on the outside.  so shout out to a friend that put me onto vital proteins.  i will leave a link in the description and i will finally update and upload that video to tell you how i make it and use it.  As I said, I played up my styles a lot more.  I have a five head, so I like to cover it up with hair.  I continued using my steamer.  I loved it so much, even put my mom onto using the steamer and she loves her steam treatments.  This was vital in keeping my hair moisturized keeping my scalp from flaking and being dry, especially up here when it gets cold.  And yes, it aided to my growth.  This is a style that I did on my mother.  And just my braid styles were just so cute.  They were so simple.  And guess what?  It cost me absolutely nothing to do my own hair.  So I saved so much money being natural.  I love just having the afro with no tension on my edges or anything like that.  that also helped me maintain length and fullness and it was just an easy to maintain style.  one style that I did and I loved but I didn't do this as much was the puff.  oh my gosh the puff can be hard on your on your edges but usually I would have a puff on times when I just did not know what else to do with my hair or if I didn't have time after I wash and dried it.  As you saw in that video, I was eating a rice cake with bananas and protein.  I made sure that I worked out, just took care of myself from the inside, plenty of water.  This picture here was from the Northwest African American Museum.  I was just loving my blackness, loving the black skin that I'm in, loving my hair and all that.  I'm going to tell you more about this product, Gliss.  I started washing my hair with this.  Shout out to my sister that put me onto it.  Here's my review.  I've never seen my 4C hair look so good.  Wow, I actually have definition and my hair is properly moisturized.  If you have 4C hair that is always dry, you need this product in your life.  Yes, you do.  This was my second time having my two-strand Marley twist and shaving my head.  And this was a great style because I was able to work out, wake up, no manipulation of my hair.  So it was a great protective style.  In December, I went to Cincinnati where my niece was able to do my hair.  So yes, I just wanted a different look, change it up, low maintenance.  And boy, did she hook me up.  So check out this style.  Yes, I must say, being natural, I have become tender-headed.  Yes, I do not like a lot of tension on my hair, but this was doable.  I was able to wear this style out for a month.  Hi, Buddha.  That's my son that everyone loves from my last video.  I kept in those braids until mid-January, and I would have kept them in longer, but I just wanted to wash and condition my hair.  So here I am, first thing in the morning looking mean, and I'm taking down my braids.  I did a braid out.  And you will see that I was able to get so much length and fullness in the matter of a month.  I made sure that I oiled my scalp daily.  I drank plenty of water.  I worked out.  There I am at the gym.  And that was the fro hoc that I was able to achieve following my braids.  I have a video on my channel that shows you how to do a braid out or how I do my braid out.  that results in tons of definition.  Make sure you check that out as well.  I was loving the versatility of my hair and also just the fullness.  And I was able to do that with just a small amount of products.  Like my hair care product routine is so simple, but it wasn't complete unless I had the Ray Solution Extreme Hair Growth Yogurt by Sekhmet Sapphire Sun.  I'll link her channel here.  You can contact her to order some.  I sing her praises.  She makes that by hand.  And continuing on with the cold weather, just make sure I kept my hair moisturized.  I just did my twist and braids every couple of days.  Stayed on my regimen of washing and deep conditioning and keeping moisture in my hair.  That there was a braid out and that's like my go-to style.  I absolutely love that style.  Between, I would say on my weekends, I would shampoo my hair on the weekends, then I'll put on a scarf.  So half my hair is braided, the other half is out while I went out and ran errands.  But when I was at work, I went ahead and just unraveled my hair and yes, just rocked this little style here where I put some hair combs on the side and fluff out the rest.  And there we go.  low manipulation styles.  i have my gallon of water here to show you you need water or your hair skin and nails will suffer.  okay get your water in.  this was just a puff.  and then i think in the front i had a small twist So that you don't have to change it up, but still have something cute.  And being natural, you have so many different options, so many ways to be creative and just be cute.  This afforded me time to focus on my face.  I played up my features.  And this is when I hit my Lady of Rage Afro Puff stage.  Yes, who remembers her from the 90s and the Steve Harvey show?  All I needed was a big pair of hoop earrings and I was all the way in there.  I'm so sad that I did not record my transformation to Pam Grier.  That video's on my channel, but when I put on my hair and makeup, I did not record that portion.  I wish I did, but this is when it's important to have black icons that look like you because you can definitely see how low maintenance and how, I don't know, the least amount of manipulation to your face and your hair to look like icons that look like you, if that makes sense.  So Pam Grier, that's my girl.  I look up to her and I rock it.  This was another braid style and in the front I did a two strand twist using the Black Murray's beeswax for the definition.  I absolutely love rocking this style at work.  Also off work, I was able to just put on a head wrap and go and still be fashionable.  this was me detangling getting ready for wash day.  so yes i actually have an afro.  i'm so happy this video is on my channel.  this is my braid out.  yes it's called a bomb ass braid out and this is the definition.  you can see all the products i used how i achieved that.  that is probably my go-to style.  It's low manipulation.  It makes sure that my hair is moisturized.  I have oil.  I have liquid conditioners.  And that's just it.  Just such a cute style.  And it was free.  Again, I can't stress how much money I've saved by being natural.  And also, this was the first year I did not wear any wigs or weaves.  Can you believe it?  You cannot be a YouTuber and do a hair video without a toothbrush for your edges now.  I had to do that.  And that's how it looked at work.  It was, you know, professional.  Yeah, I have no complaints about being natural this year.  I am just so glowing from loving my natural beauty.  And I hope you do the same as well.  Hey I'm back and I am done applying the Kawi Mahindy Amla hair color to my hair.  I have to edit that video and upload it but that's the way I naturally color my hair.  I love when my hair is super duper duper ultra black and I use this natural hair color that I picked up at an Indian store near my sister's house in Ohio.  So yeah I need to edit and upload that video because yes you girl have salt and pepper.  I got some little grays in my hair.  And I like to just color my entire hair dark, but this is also a great covering treatment to avoid using harsh chemicals.  It has amla oil, so it feeds your hair and makes it shine.  This was me braiding my hair to show you how much growth I had.  Now you won't see me with the ruler t-shirt on or checking my growth and my length like that.  I think that stuff is like OCD.  and you're comparing yourself to others so you won't see it on my channel.  i know i speak too early but i don't like compare my hair growth to others.  it depends on your individual dna.  um when i went on my road trip this year i loved how my scarves helped me just Get up and go, but don't look like a bad lady on a road because I absolutely hate when people wear bonnets out in public.  Yes, if you're going to wear your bonnet, put a scarf on and make it look cute, okay?  My hair, I must say, loved the summer heat and humidity.  Oh my gosh, when I got to Florida, it was so humid, but my hair loved it.  My hair grew like hell when I was down there.  So yes, this is just a puff.  I think I had this style before.  A puff in the back and then the front is like a bang.  But because of the humidity and the sun, I just let my hair do what it wanted to do.  Now this was a braid out idea.  Now this time I did a cornrow straight back and my hair looks so cute.  So much definition.  I think it went away because I went swimming like the next day.  Then I got my huge puff in Florida.  I just maintained low manipulation styles and just got up and went.  I got so many compliments from brothers of my hair, sisters alike.  I was just living in melanin greatness.  As you see, I'm under this tree in Florida, just really cooling and chilling, chilling and cooling.  When my weekends came, I did the same thing.  I would braid up my hair.  And I'll put on my head wrap if I had to go out somewhere.  Just kept it really cute, really versatile.  I found that on times where others would slap a wig on, I would just slap on a hair scarf and just be fierce and fabulous.  And yes, just having my afro.  I just love living with my afro.  I'll put on some earrings, my makeup, a cute outfit.  I'm good to go.  When I went up to Virginia, I picked up a cowboy hat, a couple of cowboy hats because I was living like my idol Pam Grier.  Now this is important right here.  Look at the back of my head when I turn around.  There you see all those braids in the back and I just unraveled the front area and that's pretty much my go-to style.  I guess others will have a go-to wig.  That's my go-to style.  And there I am again in the swamp.  I had my front out and I had the two hair combs on the side.  Then I had my back free.  So I just put my hat on, rocked it.  I know in this video I look like somebody's auntie, but it's okay.  This is another one.  I think I was getting ready to wash my hair.  So I just put my hair scarf on, left my edges out.  This is how my hair looked underneath my cowboy hat, but that is my go-to style.  I was already doing a length check, but I was like, hey, look at my hair, baby.  I was really just falling in love with the progress, but I think I trimmed my hair right after I did that too.  It's important to trim your hair as well.  Because it was humid, some days I'll put on a full scarf, cover up my hair and braid it.  Then I started getting creative and putting braids on the side versus just using a hair comb.  That is pretty much it.  Then my go-to puff, like I said, I don't wear my puff too often.  Because I don't like the tension on my edges.  So there's my hair.  It was super duper black.  I did not color my hair from the time you saw me with the video and I still haven't colored it to this day.  So I'm about due for another AMLA treatment.  Here we go again.  I'll just slap on my scarf and I will go.  I have so many different colors of scarves.  I absolutely love it.  So underneath that scarf, I have my hair twisted.  And that there is my twist out.  Yes.  I absolutely love my hair journey.  It's growing like my hair now.  It comes past my eyebrows.  And yeah, your girl is doing her thing with her lipstick.  Oh my gosh.  I think that my lips and my eyes are my best features.  I just rock them.  And Every day I'm just glowing more and more.  I would say my hair, skin, and nails love the heat.  My hair thrived over the summer.  So I'm looking forward to getting back to some hot weather and just, I don't know, being the melanin goddess I am.  Here we go into September.  Still doing the same thing, rocking my twist outs.  I stopped doing braid outs.  Now I do twist outs.  I just find that they are a lot easier to unravel than to unravel my braids.  The only bad side is that I don't have as much definition as I would if I had a braid out.  But I love my twist outs.  They give me a little edgy look, but it's still classy and professional.  I think of it as how Hilary Banks had her hair on the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  So that is just a great style to just rock.  I won't say all the time, but yeah, you can do all the time.  I wish that I had more time off so that I can play it up with accessories and different things like that.  So here we are.  We are in October and this is the end of this journey.  I want to leave you here and I'm going to pick up next year and take you into November.  But I thank you so much for watching my hair journey for year two.  Can you believe it?  It's been two years since I took that set of clippers and shaved off all my hair.  But I highly encourage you to just stay beautiful, love your journey, and love being naturally you.  This is me here, 17, 18, and 19.  And as you can see, the glow up was super duper real, y'all.  If you're a subscriber to this channel here and also my other channel, you will see how I just put self-love in full effect, you know, a total 360 all the way around in my life.  If you want to be one of those that's super out there, 720, okay?  But yes, when you love yourself, you treat yourself better and it shows on the outside.  Thank you for watching.
