            "text": "Aloha again, everyone.  Today I thought I'd do another story time.  I thought maybe I'd tell a story about my divorce and what went down and why it kind of sucked, but in retrospect was probably one of the better things that's ever happened to me in my life.  The year was about 2011.  At that point, we got married in 2004, so about six years, seven years.  We decided to move to Florida.  The kids were, I think, four and five.  We had kicked around this idea of moving to Florida before we had our first child.  We kind of put it on hold when we found out we were pregnant.  Then we brought it back again a few years later.  Now, don't get me wrong.  At the time, looking back, hindsight's always 20-20.  The relationship wasn't perfect.  We were having some issues, but it wasn't bad.  I thought it was going okay.  Every relationship has its issues and its ups and downs.  I figured we'd work through it.  We had this idea of let's move back down to Florida.  Let's do this over again.  So we pack everybody up, get them down there.  We run a nice house.  I run a really nice house with a pool and everything, backyard with a swing set in it for the kids.  The ex had a job down there.  Her job actually transferred her, which is really good because we were in southwest Florida, Fort Myers, Cape Coral area, and it's rough.  It's a rough part of town for trying to find jobs.  This is shortly after the bubble pop, so a lot of people were bankrupt and foreclosed.  It was a rough situation at the time, but we were doing okay.  I sold cars up north, so I thought I could just go down south and sell cars again.  It was a totally different world than what I thought it was going to be.  It wasn't anywhere near my ideal idea of selling cars.  So I stepped away from that profession and decided to look for something different while I was down there.  And I think that at this point, she was a little unhappy with her job.  I don't think it was going the way that she thought it would go.  And I think that we, you know, I didn't see it all.  We were very sidetracked with moving and everything, but it's all a little stressed out.  And she came to me one day and just said, I want a divorce.  I could tell things were going bad up to that point, and I figured that in order for her to come to me and say that, she's been thinking about this for a while.  This wasn't just like a, hey, today I thought of this and I want a divorce.  This has been on her mind for a little bit.  So I said, that's fine.  From this moment forward, every decision we make is for the kids.  We make the decisions based on what's good for the kids.  And she was cool with that and we went our own ways.  We had to stay in the house together for about four or five months because the rent on it was more than either one of us could afford on our own and we were both just kind of getting situated.  Her job she was hating and I was just starting to get into a job of my own.  So she ended up switching jobs and it was right about the time, shortly before I moved out, she switched jobs and she got a job with a bank.  And banking jobs are horrible.  I don't know how, if any of you guys are bankers, that's fine, but I don't know how you do it.  She instantly started dating her boss.  So that became a relationship right away.  She's probably about a 7, 7.5.  If you just looked at her and just seen her looks-wise, especially back then, 7.5.  He's probably about a 5.2.  Give him that point, too.  So clearly a difference in range right there.  Right.  Not a you know, it's one of those couples where you look at him and go, we all know why she's with him.  But he was a good dude.  He took care of the kids.  He had season passes to Disney and things like that.  So he did love him.  He loved those kids and he loved her.  And she.  use them for all he's worth, I guess.  But at the time I didn't realize that, you know, they, I thought everything was going pretty good.  And we were there, we were doing the split parenting thing in town for probably two and a half, three years.  And from there I got to a point where I thought, you know, I, I despised Florida.  Uh, it wasn't a bad life looking back at it.  I had a lot of fun and it was a relatively easy way of life.  And I met some really good people, but I despised it because that was always her idea.  You know, it was always her plan to move to Florida and I was kind of game for it.  But when the divorce came along and everything, I started to despise being there.  So when she was doing pretty good with this dude and they moved in together and they had a nice little house and all that stuff, I decided to move back to Pittsburgh.  Um, it was a hard decision.  You know, I'm a, I'm a very hardworking father with my children and it was hard to feel like I was leaving them.  Um, but I knew that one day I just had this feeling that one day it would all make sense.  And I moved back up North and the kids loved it.  I mean, they loved coming back up here for a summer break and Christmas break and just seeing their family and everything.  Cause Florida, they were kind of on an Island, you know, she had a few friends, but that was really it.  And they just kind of did their own little thing.  Um, So it was tough.  It was tough living up here and not having my kids with me all the time.  And there was a lot of, I wouldn't say I was depressed, but there was days I thought about them and I really missed them.  And I just always thought one of these days, one of these days.  So a little over a year ago, so let's see here.  That would have been, uh, 2017 end of 2017.  I get a phone call from my ex.  Now at this point she had, uh, the guy that she was living with her and him split ways.  He found out she was cheating on him.  Shocker.  Um, And he finally, you know, he until she pretty much took every penny of this guy's money that she was living with.  He was at the end.  He was going through his 401k.  He was unemployed.  He lost his job.  I mean, it was just he was just depressed.  He was a beta.  So he was just depressed beyond all hell that he got taken advantage of like that.  Um, she, he finally got up to the point where he kicked her out and she went and got her own place, which I had to help out with.  I had to help out with putting money down and, and, you know, she didn't have enough to pay for deposits for electricity and stuff like that.  So I help her out.  We get her this place and I just know anytime she's on her own, it doesn't last very long.  So at this point I was like, okay, I'm going to start keeping an eye on the situation down there and I'm going to start knowing what's going on.  The kids came back up for the summer and I didn't really want to send them back down because I just felt like something wasn't right.  But legally I kind of had to, so I did.  And by, so that would have been what, June, July, August, yeah, when I sent them back to school.  And by October I get a phone call from my ex-wife and she says, I'm thinking about moving back to Pittsburgh.  music to my ears but i didn't let her know that i had to play the card.  right you know because all i wanted to do my whole goal was get them up here get them back up to pittsburgh back under my roof and then the rest will you know.  short term uh loss long or yeah how's that go?  yeah short term loss long term gain.  so it was going to be.  you know those couple years i spent up here by myself were hard but it's going to all pay off now.  So I, you know, I tell her, don't worry about it.  Get up here.  I'll have a place for the kids.  I'll have rooms for them, all that stuff.  You can go stay with your mom, whatever it takes.  I get a phone call a couple of days later and it gets pushed up by like two or three weeks closer.  I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Like you're really pushing.  It was supposed to be like beginning of November.  They were going to move up.  It turns out she got served her 10 day eviction notice.  So she had 10 days to get out or she was going to be kicked out.  Beautiful.  Right.  So I tell her, I'm like, well, look, here's the deal.  Just get back up here.  Whatever it takes.  I'll get you guys all figured out.  Just let's just do this.  Right.  So she comes back up.  She tries to stay with her mom for like a couple of days.  And her mom is just her mom's the reason why she is who she is.  You know, her mom basically put her up in a hotel with the kids and their two cats because she didn't want them in the house.  This is the mom that hasn't barely seen my children, her grandchildren, in probably about seven years.  They have an opportunity to stay with her for one weekend, and she puts them up in a hotel.  Beautiful.  So I realized that her staying with her mother was going to be a hot mess and it was just going to lead to nothing but turmoil.  And I lived relatively on the bus line, so she could easily get a bus at least to downtown Pittsburgh every day.  I lived right by a park and ride.  So I made a decision that I regret, but I let her move in with me.  So I told her, I said, look, just come move in with me.  You can crash here.  We'll, we'll figure it out for, you know, six months till you get your feet on the ground and we'll get you, you know, we'll get you back into life.  You can get a job with the downtown.  She didn't have a car.  Her car was repo.  She didn't have nothing.  She had zero, zero to her name.  So of course I come in and rescue the day again, which I should have never have done.  But my whole goal was to get my children back here, right?  The easier I can make her feel comfortable with coming back up here and it was going to be simple.  It was, like I said, it was a little bit of a loss at the time, but it worked out in the end.  So I, uh, it lasts a lot longer than i wanted it to.  it was probably a little over a year like 14 months.  she ended up living here when she moved back and i was just enabling her and we weren't.  we weren't even having sex nothing i mean.  it was just solely.  uh it wasn't a bad arrangement.  i mean she cooked she cleaned which was something she didn't do when we were married.  so she must have picked that up along the way and she helped out with the kids.  so i was able to go run around and do a little bit of stuff still.  and and you know my business requires me to run around a lot and whatnot.  so Uh, It's it worked out OK.  But I got to a point where I said, you got to go.  Right.  She was just getting on my nerves.  She was trying to change.  She turned into a victim in Florida.  I blame it on her going to school.  She went back to like nursing school or something like that at one of the universities down there.  And she was never the same afterwards.  She used to be really strong, very strong minded and and very independent thinking.  And she turned into a sheep.  So and I started to notice that in a way she would talk to me.  And she has that very downward talk.  Like, you think you are so special.  Stuff like that she'd say.  I don't know.  She'd try to talk down to me and try to beat me down.  And I finally went off on her one day and I just said, listen.  I saved you, okay?  This is my way of paying you back.  I feel bad that I left you in Florida for a little while there, and I was sending money and whatnot, but it wasn't always 100% what I could, it was always what I could send, but it wasn't 100% what I wanted to send because I just, my job was up and down.  I was doing commission sales at the time, and it was rough.  So I felt bad, so I felt like, look, this was my penance.  I paid off by giving you a place to stay for free, giving you a place to be without having to, I didn't charge her a dime delivery.  She had to pay for groceries, that was it.  Um, and she just squandered the time away.  I mean, here we are 14 months later at the time and she didn't have any money saved up.  She still didn't have a car.  She still didn't have anything put together to get a house.  It just, there was nothing.  So finally one day I just snapped and I said, look, you gotta go.  I said, you gotta go.  You gotta go stay with your mom.  You gotta go figure out your life.  You gotta do, do something, but you can't be here.  I'm just enabling you to keep being a bum.  I mean, she was working part time and she got a job that required her to drive around.  She didn't even have a car.  So I had to pick her up and drop her off half the times.  And it just got to be to a point where I said, you're taking advantage of this situation.  There's no more.  I don't feel bad anymore.  I paid you back.  I gave you an opportunity to live here.  You could go work two, three jobs if you needed to and put as much money away as you wanted to.  And you chose to just throw it all away.  So baby bird had to leave the nest.  That was in January of this year, right after the holidays.  I said, you got to go.  Uh, funny part about it is she goes, she starts applying for full-time jobs within like two days.  She lands a very good career job, a job that she could be at for the rest of her life with a good local company.  That's that she landed a good job.  She'll never thank me for that.  But if I didn't boot her out the house, it would have never happened.  Um, So it's always been a little bit of a turmoil with her.  And I'm finally at a point now where we don't really speak much.  So it's just kind of, you know, she's living with her mom and her mom's boyfriend and she's held today.  She couldn't find a car.  She was trying to rent a car so that she could take the kids out for the day and do something.  So, uh, That's whenever I decided that it was my time to do MGTOW.  I mean, I looked it up.  I found a bunch of information from it and I just said, you know what?  This sounds like the life for me.  I am so done with women and I'm so done with women just taking advantage of men and beating them down and trying to turn them into something that they're not.  I'm just not for that.  But that was kind of a condensed version, I guess, of all the events.  But hopefully, where are we at?  Like 12, 13 minutes?  That's not too bad.  I can do a longer one.  We can get into a little bit more detail, some of the stuff that went down.  But my whole experience with it is I just don't trust women anymore.  My... My... trust factor is so low that I almost find it impossible to even try to date a woman.  I don't believe anything that they say to me anymore.  I just don't believe it.  And when you deal with somebody like that and you see this in multiple people's lives, and it's funny because like I said, I was the first one in my friend circle to get married, the first one to have kids, first one to get divorced.  Now everybody's going through divorces and everybody, they're all just hitting that stage now where they hate each other.  because they don't marry for love.  you know i didn't marry for love.  i thought i married for love but she definitely didn't marry for love.  and looking back i was young dumb but not this time.  this time around i'm taking care of me and i'm taking care of these kids.  so I love you guys.
