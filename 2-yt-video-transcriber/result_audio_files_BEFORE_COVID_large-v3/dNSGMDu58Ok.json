Congressional approval rating last I checked was something like 17%.  And Americans don't trust the media networks to tell them the truth.  The media networks didn't do us any favors by missing the reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place.  If you turn on cable network news today, you would think he's our president because of some combination of Russia, racism, Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and emails all mixed together.  But Americans around the country know different.  We blasted away 4 million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri.  I just left Iowa.  We blasted 40,000 manufacturing jobs there.  The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems, the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see what's going on in our communities and solve those problems.  What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment, which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be, and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place.  We have to take every opportunity to present a new positive vision for the country, a new way forward to help beat him in 2020, because make no mistake, he'll be there at the ballot box for us to defeat.

Also at record highs, depression, financial insecurity, student loan debt.  even suicides and drug overdoses.  It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history.  The fact is this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people's lived experience on the ground.  If you are a recent college graduate, you have a 40% chance of doing a job that doesn't require a college degree.

We're already doing it.  We relocated a town in Louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose.  And we know that town is not alone.  That's playing out in coastal areas around the country.  The question is, do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself, or do you come together as a country and say, we need to protect our people from climate change?  Part of my plan is literally called Move People to Higher Ground, because that's what we need to do.  And that's literal and figurative.  Here in California, it's forest fires and forest management.  On nuclear power, I agree with the research.  We need to have everything on the table in a crisis situation, which this is.  Other countries have had success with nuclear power, and the next generation thorium reactors have a wealth of potential.  Thorium is not radioactive the way uranium is.  It doesn't last as long, and you can't make a weapon out of it.  If we're going to innovate our way out of this, as Elizabeth is saying, then we have to have nuclear on the table.

They have numbers.  The average net worth of a black household is only 10% that of a white household.  For Latinos, it's 12%.  If you are a black woman, you're 320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth.  These are the numbers that define race in our country.  And the question is, why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage?  Fewer than 5% of Americans donate to political campaigns.  You know what you need to donate to political campaigns?  Disposable income.  The way we fix it... The way we fix this is we take Martin Luther King's message of a guaranteed minimum income, a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for all Americans.

They banned face masks in Hong Kong.  Why?  Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street so they can follow up with them and detain them later.  This is the rivalry that we have to win where China is concerned.  They're in the process of leapfrogging us in AI because they have more data than we do, and their government is subsidizing it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.  I have sat with our leading technologists, and they say they cannot match the Chinese resources.  China just produced its first major smartphone that does not have Google apps.  and it is now trying to export its technology to the rest of the world.  What we have to do is build an international coalition to set technology standards, and then you can bring the Chinese to the table in a very real way, because this is their top priority, and this is where we need to out-compete them and win.

There are nearly 200,000 DACA recipients, so-called dreamers, in the state of California, more than any other state, including several students right here at LMU.

That's where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation.  The fact is strong societies would elect more female leaders.  Strong men treat women well for the same reasons.  I'm on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government because the fact is if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons.  So it's related to our campaign finance rules because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally anti-woman marketplace, and that includes the marketplace for politicians.  If we were to put $100 democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter, instead of 5% contributing, you'd see that rate skyrocket to 50% or 60%, and you'd have many, many more women who would run for office because they don't have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave.
