So, two individuals in the original list, Peter and James, three groups, the twelve, the five hundred, and all the apostles, which the general feeling is that's a larger group than the twelve disciples.

He said, I laid my gospel before the other apostles and said, guys, tell me, are we all on the same page?  Okay, were they on the same page?  Well, just a few verses later, you get these five words in English.  They added nothing to me.  They added nothing.  Well, Paul, that's pretty good, but you left out these two points.  No, they added nothing to me.  And then just a few verses after that, they give Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship.  I ask people, when's the last time you laid hands on somebody who was a heretic?  I mean, that means agreement by its very nature.  And then you have Paul saying, 1 Corinthians 15, 11, right after that early creed in 1 Corinthians 11, he says, he just got done talking about the others who saw Jesus, James, Peter.  He says, whether it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believe.  I think what Paul's saying is, look, you don't believe me?  Please, go talk to Peter.  Go talk to James.  You're going to get the same story from all of us.  And that kind of, it fits like this. ",
