He just \u2013 But the agency doesn't do that.  We don't use honey traps.  We don't do that sort of thing because that sort of leverage, it's always going to head south on you.  And so we don't try to coerce somebody in sort of a relationship that then we can take advantage of.  And yet other services do.  Russians being one of them, they do that all the time.  Israelis, yeah, they've had some very successful efforts to do that.  And if you can \u2013 if you get somebody in that position, it doesn't matter how they're compromising themselves, whether you're putting themselves in with like an Epstein situation where suddenly you've got them \u2013 you've got video of them with an underage person.  or whether they've provided a document that they shouldn't provide.  The concept is always the same.  It doesn't matter what that action is.  You're getting them on the hook.  You're getting something that's leverageable over them.  And if they don't just go forward immediately, say, and turn around to their boss and say, I'm guilty, did this.  I'm sorry then they're compromised.  and then you've got them as an Intel service.  you've got them.  you can start reeling the hook in because now you know.  you know that not only did they do something to prodded you with a document even if it was an unclassified.  if I go to somebody if I'm developing a relationship with somebody some target overseas or whatever and I'm thinking all right I'm trying.  now I'm exploring.  this person's got access.  they're in an interesting position interesting job and they've got access to information that we want to know.  that's priority target.  And then I want to say, okay, now I want to develop a relationship a little bit.  Maybe I bump into the person at a few parties.  Maybe we're in the same parent-teacher organization, whatever the shit is, right?  Our kids play on the same soccer team.  So then I go and I think, okay, what do I want to do?  I want to test the waters a little bit.  I'm not going to say, hey, listen, I understand you work at the foreign ministry here in whatever country you happen to be in.  How about you give me some documents?  But instead, maybe it's something different.  Maybe they work at the foreign ministry.  Maybe they work at an aerospace business.  That's a target.  But you've developed a bit of a relationship, and then you say, yeah, my kid's doing this school project, and it's all about \u2013 whatever, hypersonic flight.  And you know that they work at some aerospace company and say, do you have anything just on hypersonics?  And you're not looking for anything classified.  You're just looking for a research paper or a study or something.  And if they come back and say, yeah, you know what?  Here, this is an interesting study.  Now, that act alone \u2013 they're not giving you something classified.  But that act alone means something big, right?  It means they were taskable in a sense, right?  They responded to your request for information.  They're suckers.  Not suckers necessarily.  It could be an enormously smart person.  But \u2013 and smart people get \u2013 yeah, they get suckered into it.  I guess you could put it that way.  But \u2013 So anyway, then you go from there.  Then you ratchet it up slowly, bit by bit if you've got the timeframe to do it.  Maybe sometimes you've got a shortened timeframe because there's a requirement to get something and you've got to accelerate the whole process.  Anyway, so \u2013 but the point being is it's still leverageable and Epstein was obviously getting leverage on all these different people for whatever his purpose was. ",
