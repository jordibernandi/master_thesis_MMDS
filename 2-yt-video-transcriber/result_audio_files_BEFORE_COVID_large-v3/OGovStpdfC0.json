            "text": "incredible.  who Joshua explain what we have here?  we have two pieces of sulfur or brimstone which we found at Gomorrah.  this is pretty big it is.  it does seem to be a lot of people that think that this is the place of Gomorrah down by the Dead Sea, which is over there.  And looking at these straight lines.  and the swirls that you can see in the ash and remains over there.  Some people say that that is to do with the fervent heat that came upon the place when it was destroyed suddenly.  But, you know, very, very wicked things going on here in the Bible, talking about not only the sexual deviance and the sexual side, but also the sins with the angels, which seems to be something that was going on there in Genesis.  And how many have you got of these?  Quite a lot, but here we've got probably about 30.  Let's see.  I mean, they are huge.  They are huge pieces.  Thank you for showing these.  I thought they were a sherbet sweet candy when you gave it to me, and I nearly ate one, but I'm glad you showed us them so we can actually see them, you know, that people at home can see these.  Considering the Bible describes this as being once like an Edenic area, you see nowadays it's just completely dead, as we are told happened to this place that was judged.  Today it's completely dead.  Nothing is growing here.  The whole thing is like sponge.  I really want to find one of those sulphur stones before the sun goes down.  I really want to find one of those stones to show you.  That is not a normal shape.  That doesn't look natural at all.  That definitely seems to be a man-made shape.  and is this not enough evidence for people just to find all of these man-made looking structures, ashen remains crumble in your hands in the location where we're told in the Bible as evidence of God's judgment.  as described by Josephus, historian, but then also finding circular, almost pure sulphur balls in the middle of the ash, in the middle of the walls and the shapes of the buildings.  Is this not enough evidence for us to see that A, the Bible is true, and B, God is a just God and we need a saviour?  Because sin requires punishment.  Sin is... brings on the wrath of God and this place is the evidence of the wrath, the wrath of God, a holy God who is righteous and true.  and this place was very rebellious and not only went into sexual deviance and other deviances but was also a place that was going into the spiritual abominations, much like we see written about the Mark of the Beast and the hybridization and the merging with the fallen and all of these things.  So this seems to be a place that was going into that and received absolute annihilation, turned to dust.  with fire and brimstone that rained down from heaven.  The brimstone is still evident in these ash structures, still evident, pure sulfur.  And I believe has been studied and checked and found to be almost entirely pure.  Some of the purest, if not the purest that you can find in the world.  is in these ashen remains.  Come on, folks, let's turn to the almighty God who saved us from our sin and pardoned us from the penalty that we deserved, and that Jesus, Yeshua, Jesus Christ, his Son, who took that wrath for our eternal iniquity, against God on the tree, on the cross and took our punishment away.  We have been saved.  Turn to him.  Turn to him before it's too late because hell is real, hell is eternal and if we don't accept the one who paid the price in full and settled the legal requirement for our sins If we don't turn to him, we will suffer for eternity justly because we deserve it and we've sinned against the holy and almighty God.  Finally, after all this time, I've found one.  ladies and gentlemen a sulfur ball in the ruins of the city.  this has been tested before and these are almost you know very highly pure sulfur.  look at that.  look at that.  a perfect sulfur ball just like the bible says that's fire and sulfur destroyed this place.  Wow.  I'm so glad I found one.  Rained fire and brimstone from heaven to destroy this city, the ashen remains of this city.  I have found one, it is real.  They are here, embedded into the ashen ruins.  Okay, with this piece of sulphur that I managed to find, I'm now going to burn it and see what happens.  Here we go.  It hits the back of your throat.  Book of James here, therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness and receive with meekness the planted word which is able to save your souls.  Be a doer of the word.  Let's live out the word of God.  And be merciful to others.  So speak as so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.  For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy.  Mercy triumphs over judgment.  God's mercy has triumphed over his judgment.  He has shown us mercy that we did not deserve by saving us.  through Jesus.  God in the flesh came and paid the price for our sin and showed us mercy when we did not deserve mercy.  So we are all sinners and we would all be condemned if it wasn't for Jesus.  So because of his great love, let us be merciful to others, let's love one another.  Because God in his great love has shown us such mercy when we did not deserve it.  And his mercy has triumphed over his judgment that we are now forgiven, we are set free because of what Jesus has done.  And I'm just so thrilled to be part of the liberty that's in Jesus because I know where I've come from.  I know who I am.  I know that I don't deserve God's mercy in the slightest.  I know that he has been so gracious to me and and I encourage you to find that liberty and that grace in God yourself that we lay everything down at the foot of the cross.  and because of his love we can come to him boldly in the day of judgment because we are washed clean not through our own merit or we've done anything to make ourselves righteous but because we've recognized that we need a doctor that the sick people we are, that we need a doctor, that we are incredibly broken and rebellious, and we have been walking in darkness all of our life before we have received Jesus, that we need to be saved from the power of darkness, from the power of Satan unto God, that this is the liberty we find in Jesus, that we're no longer condemned for our sins, that we have been set free and made clean and new by his righteousness.  And folks, there's no greater gift to receive than this.  There's no greater love than to know the one who loved us first and loved us so much that he laid down his life on the cross to set us free from eternal hell.  that we deserved, from the wrath of God on the unrighteousness and on the sin of this world.  That we were part of that.  We were part of that kingdom.  And that we did nothing to deserve being rescued.  But because God loves us so much that he sent his only son, that whoever should believe in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.  And that is the greatest news.  That's the good news that we find the love that is in Jesus, the Messiah.  That is good news, my friends. ",
