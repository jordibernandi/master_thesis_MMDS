Sinkholes in the Dead Sea is a result of fresh water that are going under the ground, meeting the sediment layers, and this is all the white that you see out here on the beach, and melting them.  Okay?  When they melt them, they create a cavity.  Now, if we have a freshwater spring that is going under the sea, and it's going through sediment layers, it will melt them.  So we do have sinkholes that also occur under the water. ",
