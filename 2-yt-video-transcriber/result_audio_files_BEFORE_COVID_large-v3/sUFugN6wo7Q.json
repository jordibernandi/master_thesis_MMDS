            "text": "And we need to talk about Bill Nye's recent segment on John Oliver, just last night actually, where he laid out clearly that the planet is facing a climate catastrophe and we need to do something about it.  And what a lot of politicians, especially those who are conservatives but even a lot of liberals, they failed to do is have real conversations about how we need to change things.  There's this whole narrative that we can keep just doing things as we've always done them, or that small band-aids can fix this major problem, but that is BS.  But Bill Nye lays it out, and I'm just going to throw this clip in right here. ",

By the end of this century, if emissions keep rising, the average temperature on Earth could go up another four to eight degrees.  What I'm saying is the planet's on fucking fire.  There are a lot of things we could do to put it out.  Are any of them free?  No, of course not.  Nothing's free, you idiots.  Grow the fuck up.  You're not children anymore.  I didn't mind explaining photosynthesis to you when you were 12, but you're adults now, and this is an actual crisis.  Got it?  Safety glasses off, motherfuckers. ",

            "text": "This is fantastic.  I mean, it really is a clash with how you often see Bill Nye as a kid.  If you remember, you didn't remember him dropping F-bombs on PBS 20-odd years ago, 30-odd years ago.  But right now, he's showing people that adults in the room, we need to get a grip and deal with the crisis at hand.  There is no easy or cheap solutions.  There are going to be social and economic costs to the climate crisis.  There's no way around that.  There's no sugarcoating this.  This isn't a fairy tale.  This isn't a dream sequence.  We have waited far too long.  We have been far too reluctant to actually address things gradually.  If we started 30, 40 years ago, maybe we wouldn't need drastic solutions.  But we didn't start 30 or 40 years ago.  So we need to leap.  We need a Green New Deal.  We need to leap forward to a future where the climate is put down.  As a central priority.  And the reality is.  Is that it's going to have social and economic costs.  Bill Nye is right.  Are there solutions that don't cost money?  He's like no.  Grow the fuck up.  There's going to be solutions.  But they're going to have costs.  This is where the Green New Deal comes in, folks.  This is where the Green New Deal comes in.  John Oliver's surrounding segment was about the Green New Deal.  You know, some of the limitations about how it's been described, we don't know a lot of things from how it would be implemented specifically, but a generally supportive segment on the idea of the Green New Deal.  And in my view, the Green New Deal outlines that our climate must be saved and it will require massive political and economic and social reform to do so.  Now this doesn't mean that the all people must give up all of the good things they have.  Central to the idea of a Green New Deal is that we can not only work to decarbonize our economy, but in so doing build a more just and equal social order.  That many people who have benefited disproportionately from this system can pay increased taxes.  And many of the workers who through no fault of their own may become displaced as we move away from certain industries will have new opportunities in building the green economy.  We'll need research done.  We'll need infrastructure, physical infrastructure built.  we can build a new future.  The costs will be there.  This isn't a fairy tale.  The Earth is on fire, and it'll only get worse.  And where the Earth isn't burning, it's literally receding back into the oceans.  There is no alternative but a Green New Deal that puts the climate and puts regular people before what has been always put before, which are the interests of the elite and the interests of private property.  We need a socialist future because the alternative is climate catastrophe.  So it's either socialism through a Green New Deal or barbarism through a Mad Maxian future.  And Bill Nye really lays it out.  I think it's an incredibly important way to look at these things.  Because again, Bill Nye's not saying in the video, look, we need socialism.  He's not saying that.  But what Bill Nye is saying, and even what John Oliver is saying, is we can't hide behind this idea that we can make this problem go away with tinkering.  There are major costs here.  Major political upheavals need to happen.  I'm not saying there needs to be bullets in the street.  But there needs to be, as Bernie Sanders would put it, a political revolution.  But as this video notes, I mean, the climate crisis won't be solved through tinkering.  Carbon taxes are not enough.  You know, the Liberal Party here in Canada, their tinkering is not enough.  Bill Nye puts it out here clearly.  There's a climate crisis, and the only solution are going to have major costs.  There's no two ways about it.  It's about building an approach... that manages those costs in an equitable manner, building a fair and sustainable future for everyone.  There's no easy way out.  There's no fairy tale that allows us to continue to keep pumping carbon yet build a future for our children and grandchildren.  But it doesn't have to mean we end up in a Mad Max or Elysium type state.  There are ways forward that will require sacrifice from some and will require most of us to change the way we live, but will build a sustainable and equitable future for all of us.
