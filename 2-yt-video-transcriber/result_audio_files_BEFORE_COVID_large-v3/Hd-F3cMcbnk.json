            "text": "When, if ever, is violence tolerable?  Can violent means ever be directed to peaceful ends?  Can we allow, through inaction, the violence of others to run rampant?  Does that constitute its own form of violence?  Is political violence necessarily terrorism?  And for that matter, can violence ever be apolitical?  I'd love to discuss these questions, but instead, we have to discuss whether or not it's okay to throw milkshakes at assholes.  We can all go out for some frosty chocolate milkshakes.  Frosty chocolate milkshakes.  Milkshakes, what are they?  A cold, sweet drink of milk mixed with ice cream, and sometimes chocolate or fruit or whatever, mixed until frothy.  Nominally, a delicious treat that brings people to yards, but lately, the most potent weapon in the culture war.  People who've been milked straight in the chops include noted assholes Carl Benjamin, the man who's such an opponent of political violence that he once attempted to soften the alt-right assassination of Heather Heyer by implying she died of a heart attack and, you know, Not the car that hit her.  Tommy Robinson, who sent Islamophobic campaign emails to the terrorist that drove his van into a group of Muslims at prayer in Finbury Park, killing one and injuring nine.  And perhaps most cruelly of all, Nigel Farage, who has long struggled with his fear of milk. ",

Farage was so shaken up by this experience that he refused to leave his trailer while campaigning in Rochester, Kent because thugs armed with sweet, tasty milk were lying in wait to ambush him.  And that's the type of courage that politicians should be showing.  To defend your convictions by bravely refusing to face the public and risk milk getting on your clothes.  Please note, this is the same man who claimed that, in the event that Brexit didn't go according to his specific plans, he would, quote, So, absolutely somebody who is disgusted by the thought of political.
