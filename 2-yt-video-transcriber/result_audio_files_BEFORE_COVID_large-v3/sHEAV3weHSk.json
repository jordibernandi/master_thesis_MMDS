            "text": "Rick Wiles wrote a book called Judgment Day, How the Coming Worldwide Computer Crash Will Radically Change Your Life.  This book came out in 1998 with dire predictions as to what's coming with Y2K.  So here's what is written.  America's darkest hour is ahead.  A worldwide computer crash beginning in 1999 will plunge the global economy into a depression.  Governments will declare bank holidays when panic spreads throughout society.  The biggest meteor storm in 33 years will destroy several vital satellites.  Violent solar storms will disrupt telecommunications and the electric power grid.  Families will shiver in the winter of 2000 when electric utilities shut down.  An oil shortage and severe drought will devastate America's food supply.  Drinking water will be rationed by National Guard troops.  Terrorists will launch a coordinated attack in America's 100 biggest cities.  How much of that happened?  Uh-huh.  Enough said.  Same Rick Wiles putting forth nonsense on True News today that may be packaged differently, just as misleading, just as wrong.  And I would encourage you to give no more credence to Rick Wiles and True News today.  then we should have given credence to Rick Wiles and his Judgment Day book in 1998.  Let me take you into some recent broadcasts.  And remember, they will not allow me on as a guest.  to refute what they're saying with equal time with their panel.  They will not come on my show to present their views and let me challenge them.  They will not have a public debate with me, a moderated public debate on any of these issues.  That alone should tell you where the truth is because when you have it, you bring it into the light and allow it to be challenged.  All right, let's go to the first clip.  Listen to what they have to say. ",

They need the Lord.  They need to repent.  They need to be saved.  Let's be candid.  There are plenty of non-Jews.  There are plenty of Gentile atheists, ungodly, who mock God.  There are the Richard Dawkins of the world writing their books attacking God.  There are the Bill Maher's who are also attacking faith in God in general, attacking other religions, even being anti-Israel in many ways and anti-religious Judaism.  So what does this prove?  Stephen Colbert is a Catholic comedian, and he'll often mock our conservative Christian position.  What does it prove?  That the ungodly mock the things of God.  But to extrapolate from this and say, see, it's the Jews.  This is classic anti-Semitism.  And just ask yourself, how many non-Jews are there who are... God mockers?  who are Christianity mockers, how many of them are there?  Be they comedians, be they intellectuals, you drop a long list.  What does it prove?  The ungodly attack the things of God.  But for Rick Wiles, because there are Jews involved, that means the Jews are somehow guilty.  Classic anti-Semitism.  All right, let's listen to some more. ",

            "text": "So here's something really interesting.  Jews are attacking Christians around the world.  So when you see Christians being beheaded in Muslim countries, is that Jews?  When you see Christians being thrown in jail in China, is that Jews?  And on and on the list goes.  When Christians are being persecuted in India by Hindus, is that the Jews?  No, in terms of violent persecution against the Jewish people, against Christians worldwide, 99.99% of it is not from Jews.  And what about the nation of Israel?  So the one Jewish state on the planet.  Is there religious liberty there?  Are Christians being beheaded?  Are Christians being thrown in jail?  Can Christians really practice their faith?  The answer is yes.  Even Messianic Jews, Jews who believe in Jesus, share in the gospel, they have opposition from religious Jews, but they can meet, they can preach on street corners in Israel.  Yes, it is true.  So this idea that the Jews are somehow responsible for persecution of Christians, again, this gets debunked.  blown out of proportion, gets exaggerated, then it ends up as a bold-faced lie.  And yes, there are liberal Jews who are on the wrong side of these issues and who have prominent roles in things like the ACLU or the SPLC and other things like that.  Absolutely.  But there are religious Jews, the Jews who follow their traditions, the Jews who follow the Talmud and Torah, which Rick Wiles is constantly attacking, rabbinic literature and things like that.  Those Jews are are often standing with Christians on these moral values.  Does that matter?  No.  Why?  Because Jews must be demonized.  All right, let's listen to some more of the illogic of true news and Rick Wiles. ",

So, number one, that is not what the Talmud teaches.  The Talmud does not teach that Christians are supposed to be slaves of Jews.  It does not teach that.  Plain and simple.  I will come on True News, gentlemen, and we will look at the Talmudic text.  I'll have the Hebrew and Aramaic in front of me, and you can have verifiable English translations.  And we'll look at the text together, and we'll see what they say.  Will you do it?  Well, if you're so sure that it's a fact, why won't you?  You'll throw a quote up, take it out of context or mistranslate it.  All right.  You won't let it be challenged.  Why?  Because that would burst your anti-Semitic bubble.  So Christian TV is now Jewish TV.  Isn't that utterly remarkable?  Do Jews teach racial superiority?  No, because Jews are not simply a race.  There are many different peoples that have been part of the Jewish people over the centuries.  We understand that.  And the Moabites like Ruth that are part of our heritage.  But is there a calling on Jewish people?  Do Jewish people believe there is a special calling and that God privileged the Jewish people with the Torah?  Yes.  And that they therefore have greater responsibility.  But anyway, listen.  I'll just play one more clip just to remind you that you cannot take these gentlemen seriously at all.
