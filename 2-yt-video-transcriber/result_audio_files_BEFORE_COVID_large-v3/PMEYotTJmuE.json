I know, I know, I seemed like the last person to ever be in one of those, but at the time, I didn't care so much about the atheism religion stuff.  I joined because they were the nicest people imaginable, and I wanted to have a reason to hang out with them.  Anyway, I would follow them to do all sorts of stuff, like Bible study, singing religious songs, and there were plenty of fun activities too, like laser tag.  One such event was listening to a speaker go over the evidence for God.  For an hour or so, we listened to him present one argument and one argument only, the fine-tuning of the universe.  I have to say, this is definitely one of the more popular ones.  Claiming that, say, the Earth is in a perfectly habitable zone isn't something incredibly difficult to understand, and can easily convince someone who isn't used to thinking in a scientific way.  So let's talk about it a bit, shall we?  Here's a video of someone making a bunch of fine-tuning arguments, and we're gonna go over them one by one.  He also does present something new, and I was interested. ",

The point is, you guys are always trying to see something that doesn't exist in patterns that are either mere coincidences or don't mean anything at all.  The moon covering the sun during an eclipse sure is a great sight, but it doesn't have to have a meaning behind it.  And if you think about it, there are plenty of good things God could do, like make it so cancer doesn't exist.  Instead, he gives us a pretty eclipse.  Wow, I'm so grateful.  Also not to mention that the moon is slowly receding from the earth at about 4 cm per year, meaning eventually the moon will not perfectly cover the sun in an eclipse.  So I guess in the far future the hidden message God is trying to tell us will expire.  Better figure out what it means before then! ",

It is the most essential atom for life due to its valence, electron numbers, and thus ability to form four covalent bonds.  This gives it the ability to form long chains and become the basis for many essential molecules.  Carbon is so important, we have an entire field of chemistry dedicated to it.  Organic chemistry.  That was one of the more difficult classes I had to take in college.  Just thinking about how our exams had an average score of 30% gives me nightmares.  Anyway, so if an atom that can form four covalent bonds be the most essential composition for life, why can't silicon?  After all, this metalloid can also form four bonds.  Good.  Fucking.  Question.  I'm glad you asked that.  Unlike carbon, silicon doesn't form versatile bonds with oxygen.  One of the best properties of carbon is its ability to be easily oxidized and reduced.  In metabolic biochemistry, that's a very important part of energy usage and storage.  Silicon doesn't have that property and thus will always remain an inferior atom.  Sorry, silicon.

So then it occurred to him that maybe these three heliums will come together as specific resonance.  In other words, there has to be a specific nuclear ground state energy. ",

Now, the predicted state in which Carbon-12 had to be in was called the Hoyle state, named after the man himself.  Later on, scientists were actually able to test it, and yes, apparently the Hoyle state exists, and it was mapped out quite clearly to look like a bent arm.  Don't ask me for the details, I'm not a physicist.  Anyway, it turns out that his calculations weren't as correct as he thought they were.  Yes, the state exists, but it wasn't nearly as precise as Hoyle thought it would be.  In fact, there was quite a range above and below 7.7 mega-electron volts, which also varied depending on if other parameters were changed.  The idea of the original argument is that the Hoyle state was so precise that it doesn't account for the vast number of carbon atoms that we see today.  But apparently, the range can go past even 0.2 difference in the Hoyle state and the amount of carbon in the universe would still be accounted for.  This is credited to other scientists who tested it after the claim was made.  Admittedly, I don't understand it all myself, but it's simply dishonest to announce that this is what science is when only one scientist has made the claim.  It's important to look at all the scientific research in it and the scientific consensus before presenting something like this as fact. ",

There have been many estimates of the range of the Goldilocks Zone, but it generally floats around 0.1 to 0.3 astronomical units for the inner edge, and 0.3 to 3 for the outer edge.  Astronomical units is the distance between the Earth and the Sun, so we can use these as percentages.  It can be about 10 to 30%.  What was the number you claimed again?  Right, 2%.  Hmm, doesn't seem like you're right here.  Plus, there are so many other planets and other solar systems that fall within the Goldilocks zone for their respective stars.

So, naturally, I went on the internet for clues.  The results I tend to encounter are ones talking about the cosmological constant problem, saying how the difference between a theorized energy and observed energy is that of the order of 10 to the power of 120, which became so famous it was coined the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics.  Solutions for this problem were proposed, and the anthropic principle was one of them, which I'm not a huge fan of myself.  But I somehow doubt you were talking about that, so what could it be then?  Apparently two arguments of fine-tuning were presented here.  One, the density parameter, which would affect the force of gravity and the force of dark energy.  Two, the cosmological constant itself, which is the ratio between the density of dark energy to that of the universe.  And it does appear that these values have to be relatively specific for stars and planets to form, but this just appeals to an overall grand fallacy that creationists use and is against the scientific method.  An idea is only proven to be true once there is reasonable elimination of all other possible explanations.  For example, in a universe so big or with the possibility of multiverses, some parts of it are bound to be suitable for life.  And it's only when an observer emerges, no matter how low the chances, can the observer then question what makes it possible for it to be there.  these other possibilities must be eliminated, or that there has to be sufficient evidence that an intelligent designer is the one and only explanation, can we then say that potentially there is a designer?  This is an important part of the thinking process when it comes to the scientific method, and once you apply it, would invalidate really any fine-tuning arguments you present for God. ",
