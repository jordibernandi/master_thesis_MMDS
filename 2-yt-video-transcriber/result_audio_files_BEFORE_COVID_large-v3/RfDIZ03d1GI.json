So I came in with you on one record, and Trick is, like, Trick is nuts.  So it's trick... I came around all guys.  Trick, Money Mark, um,  C.O.,  the whole Super Sly family, Rick Ross class, everybody.  So being in that setting, I'm the only girl, so it's very overprotective, and these guys are very annoying to me.  So now... I came on, but... So when I did NAMM, I put this out, we go on the road, we go on tour.  I didn't drink or anything, so I didn't really kind of gel with the guys.  I'm in my room, they are having a good time.  So what I mean by making me is I used that time to, like, dig into myself to figure out who I was and how I wanted to do this thing called music.  Because I was only on one record with Trick.  That's, like, 16 bars. ",

So, like, trick wasn't, I mean, he was there with me, like, doing the project, but he wasn't there, like, in my room, in the, like, my fears and, like, trying to figure out what song I want to do or how I... So that's what I mean when I say made myself.  Like, I had to step out on my own.  Of course, this is my family.  We're gonna always be a team.  But then there's the solo Trina.  There's a Trina that got five consecutive albums that I did it, you know what I mean, on my own, like, making myself constantly along the way.  That's what I mean when I say about made myself. ",

This is one of the things that, like, for me personally, was, like, one of the most hurtful things because on this Love & Hip Hop reunion, we had, like, a mad blowout.  Yeah.  Um... But that was a real blowout.  That was, believe it or not, that was years of just being frustrated.  This is my brother, so whenever we're out, I'm never gonna disrespect you, I'm never gonna clap back.  Trick is sarcastic, he's very sarcastic.  So me, you know, we out, we in public, he always says stuff and his eyes is funny.  Sometimes it's funny, sometimes I don't feel like it's funny.  And I feel like this particular day on the show, it wasn't funny.  A lot of stuff was beat down and edited out, so you didn't even understand what he was saying.  that pissed me off so bad. ",

Well, okay, after that, we talked about that, and I was like, well, no, you know, you had a job to do so many records, I had a job to do my records, and then he was like, yeah, but I don't like your records, because your records are, it's too, you know, it's, I mean, in other words, it's too girly, it's too emotional, it's not like the now, it's not the baddest chick, it's more of the, it went into, and we fight about this all the time, I mean, because he, you gotta understand, I come in from him, and... Once we did this whole thing, he's the reason the whole baddest chick come up.  Like, the whole bad... My first record, he's the reason, like, everybody calls me the baddest chick.  So, in his eyes, he always want to see that.  He don't care that I had five breakups or I could be hurt.  You trying to grow.  He don't care about none of that.  He only cares about you always got to... Because what he's thinking about... I, for me, kind of understand, but I still gotta explain to him that the difference is, is being yourself.  Like, when you're true to yourself, you're gonna always be yourself.  For me, he looks at, like, all the new generation of artists that's coming, and he feels like everybody's.  so yourself, everybody's you.  But these are girls that are growing who we watch grow up.  They're gonna grow up just like me.  And they're gonna be to a place where I'm at now, so... I don't feel like that.  I'm happy.  I'm happy when I hear the music, I can hear me inside of the music.  I don't feel no negative way about that.  But for him, no.  It's always got to be the baddest shake.  I don't want to hear no slow songs.  I don't care about no you and this, here we go again.  I just want this record and we like this.  And I'm like, well, listen, realistically... I am way more consistent than you, and I've been in the game.  When I say running the streets, like, grinding, making it to this sixth album, so you should have a... You got to give me that respect to say, like, okay, I got to hear her, I got to do it her way.  I mean, mind you, I came in doing it his way.  That's them.  And he feels like it should always be that way.  That's where the growth don't come in at.  And that's what some of the stuff was said that was edited out.  And because of the way he was saying it, I was looking at him like... What?  And, you know, we went there, but we talked since then.  Of course, he's annoying.  He calls me.  We get on the phone.  We have the whole hash out.  I scream and blow him down.  I hang up.  He calls back, and he wants to say, okay, now I'm sorry.  I get where you're coming from, but, yeah, you got to do it, mommy, because I... And I'm just like, okay, Trick.  Okay, whatever.  But we at a point... I mean, this is the first time, though, we've ever had, like, a hash out.  Like something big as that.  And I was hurt because it was on that show.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Because we could have did that on the phone.  Right.  But it just put me in a... And that's another thing about, like, being true to yourself.  Like, I, me, one person about me, one thing about me, I try to watch my surroundings and the situation I'm in.  I let him get the best of me, and it blew my cool.  Otherwise, it would never happen.  I would have held my cool, and I would have addressed it after.  But it was so the moment, and I just lost it, and I was so mad about it after.  But... The truth is, I'm happy it happened because now he gets it.  You feel like he respects you now?  Of course.  He came to me and said, like, I respect you on a woman level.  Like, I always respect you, but it's, like, still, like, my sister.  I'm seeing you as a woman now.  But now I'm looking at you, like, even now, like, it's almost like he's so used to the label controlling me.  Like, I got to respect.  you have your own label.  You're the boss.  I'm not looking at it like that.  I'm still in this whole pigeonhole, you know, thing with you.  And when he said it, it just, you know, it made me feel good.  It made me feel like, wow.  I mean, I'm happy about it, you know? ",
