The Department for Transport's contingency plan is to charter additional ferries to take the pressure off that Calais-Dover route, which accounts for 80% of our roll-on, roll-off lorry traffic, something a former Brexit secretary only belatedly discovered.  I hadn't quite understood the full extent of this, but if you look at the UK and you look at how we trade in goods... We're particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing.  And one of those key relief routes is Portsmouth, already the second busiest cross-channel port.  The Department for Transport has commissioned Brittany Ferries, at a cost of just under \u00a350 million, to run services, including between Portsmouth and Le Havre and Cannes in France, for six months starting this week.  But Newsnight has learned of something that raises further concern about the adequacy of that vital no-deal scenario planning and the competence of the Department for Transport and its under-fire boss, Chris Grayling.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, additional ferries should be steaming out of here bound for French ports.  But Newsnight has obtained a document from the Department for Transport which analyses the ability of Portsmouth to cope.  And what this document reveals is that the department has not engaged with French port operators to discern their ability to cope with the additional traffic at that end.  Indeed, the document says that the department has been forced to rely on satellite imagery to form its judgment.  The upshot is that it concedes a lot of the assumptions it makes are untested.  We have not engaged with French port operators or the ferry companies sailing to these ports, so these assumptions are untested.

And they claim that the Channel Islands had been instructed by the Department for Transport not to pass it on to them, even though it intimately concerned Portsmouth.  What Newsnight hasn't covered is about more than a row between officials in Portsmouth and officials in London.  It also raises much larger questions of competence around no-deal planning from this government.  It comes on top of the seaborne freight fiasco, where a contract to run services was awarded to a company with no ships, and last month's \u20ac33 million tunnel out-of-court settlement by the Department for Transport.  The choppy waters for this department may not be over. ",
