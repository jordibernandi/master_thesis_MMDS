            "text": "Hey guys, it's your old pal CeeDimble here.  Anyways, if you're an adult watching this, you're probably a member of some political party.  I mean, unless you're an independent.  I'm not a member of any political party because I'm a centrist independent.  Because everyone's an idiot except for me.  I'm not here to debate the quality of political parties.  Wait, so you mean you're not going to conflate political parties and political ideologies?  But the Daily Wire does.  Sorry, Benga, I don't purposefully spam my opponent with a billion arguments at once like Ben Shapiro.  Anyways, today I'm just talking about the oldest political parties to ever exist.  Now, for this list, I have two rules.  One, a party does not necessarily still have to be around.  If it existed, if it was one of the first political parties to exist, it goes on this list.  It does not matter if it's still active.  Two, I am not counting political parties that... emerged during the French Revolution, such as the Jacobins and the Mountain, because there were more clubs than political parties.  Alright, shoot.  So, number five is the Democratic Party.  The Democrats?  You're telling me that the Democrats were one of the first political parties to ever exist?  Oh my god, Ermagerd, I think I might become one of those condescending centrists.  Okay then.  Anyways.  The Democratic Party was founded on January 8, 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson.  Originally, it was a pro-slavery conservative political party.  But in 1854, the Republican Party, a liberal abolitionist party, was founded and the two parties quickly became rivals.  In 1863, Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, abolished slavery, but the two parties still remained rivals.  In 1936, the conservative Democrats became liberals and the liberal Republicans became conservatives.  And now the two parties are still rivals, but their platforms have changed.  The next party I'll be covering is the Democratic Republican Party.  The Democratic-Republican Party was founded in 1794 and, as a political party, valued rural farming communities, Jeffersonian values, states' rights, and democracy.  In 1801, it gained power over the United States of America.  However, that power was lost in 1824 when it dissolved.  The next party I'll be covering is the Federalist Party.  This political party was founded in 1789 and as a political party valued traditionalism, Hamiltonian values, and as the name suggests, power of the federal government.  The party was dissolved in 1824 along with the Democratic Republican Party.  Wow, all three political parties you've covered so far have been American, you white supremacist.  Okay, okay, Banga.  Um, the next one I'll do will be British, I guess.  Don't you know that British control over America was the one threat to its existence?  You're anti-American.  God, will anything please you?  You know what, go to the factory, Banga.  Okay.  The next party we'll be covering is the British Tories.  The Tories were founded in 1678 and were conservative, believed that the British monarchy was fine just the way it was, and opposed the reform movement going on in Britain at the time, and opposed American independence.  They dissolved in 1834.  Wait!  The Tories were conservative.  But I thought the conservatives loved America.  What about my?  I'm 1776%.  sure liberals hate me hat?  But my American independence in my 1776 hat.  So the final political party we will be covering today was also British and it was also founded in 1678.  They were the Whigs.  Now the Whigs agreed with the reform movement in Britain at the time, were liberal and were pro-American independence.  They officially dissolved on June 6th, 1859.  Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the video and I hope you have a nice weekend. ",
