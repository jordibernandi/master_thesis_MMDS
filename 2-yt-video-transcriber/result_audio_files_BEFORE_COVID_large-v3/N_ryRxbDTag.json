If I have an idea and I present it to other people, it's kind of hard for them to believe in it and for them to move when I want to move.  And if it's my dream for it to remain my dream.  So I've always initially put up my own bread down from Rachel Roy.  It was millions.  And to Rockefeller, we put up our own bread there until we got the co-venture.  And to now, making movies.  just, you know, based on my experience, the only way I could make a good movie is to do it myself.  So, yeah, I put up the bread to make it.  I directed it, produced it.  We're going to self-distribute it, you know, unless somebody comes in and helps us out with that.  You know, but it's been all right.  I'm not mad at it.  You know, the thing about being an independent is when you put out your own money... In that moment, you might feel like you broke, but you know you're not because you got work on the street.  But, you know, what my belief is, you know, being broke is pregame for being rich.  You understand what I'm saying?  You have to be broke because, again, if there's any demand, you have to supply it, you have to pay for it.  So in independent business, the bigger you get, the broker you're going to be.  You understand what I'm saying?  But as long as you have that cash flow, it's all right.  So I'm cool with it, you know, because it's nothing I'm not used to.  And also we've had to build the platform, Dame Dash Studios, to showcase all the films that I'm making independently.  So not only are we making the movie, we're also making the platform to showcase the movie where you can get it for $10 a month or $50 for the whole year.  But again, being out of pocket about a million dollars, it doesn't feel the most comfortable, but it's the most comfortable.  You understand what I'm saying?  It's like you have to have both.  You have to be uncomfortable to be comfortable.  So it just goes with it.  I'm the kind of guy that's like proud when I'm broke.  You understand what I'm saying?  I'm like, yo, I'm broke.  You know why?  Because I got a lot of work on the street.  And to someone intelligent, that's not considered broke.  But to some dumbass, yeah, I'm broke.  I got a million dollars on the street.  Once I collect it, it comes back to five million, but I'll consider that broke.  You know what I mean?  And I don't have no money to lend you, by the way.  You understand what I'm saying?  So that's the way I'm at, and that's where I'm at with it. ",

So I never consider anything a loss.  It's always a learning experience.  It's only a loss when it breaks you to the extent that you quit.  But usually, when it looks like a loss, it's the opportunity to make it a way bigger win.  Just because it's not the way you want to do it and it doesn't happen when you want it to happen, it doesn't make it wrong.  You understand what I'm saying?  Basically, it means that you just were maybe wrong about your calculation of when you were gonna get your money back or how you were gonna get your money back.  Part of winning is losing.  You understand what I'm saying?  You got to do it wrong to do it right.  How else are you gonna know unless you just step in shit?  And that barely ever happens.  So when you're doing something for the first time, it's rare you're ever going to do it right.  It's rare.  it's not going to be costly, but it's also rare that I would ever quit and take it as a loss.  So I don't consider, I don't do losses.  I just keep working until I win.  So if I'm in a fight and I get punched, it doesn't mean I lost.  If I get knocked out, I'm getting back up, but I'm swinging harder.  But as long as I can get up, I'm going to keep fighting. ",

Whoever was the record company executive at that time was supposed to sit whatever beefs, whoever he had a beef with, sit them down.  and maybe it was Jimmy Iovine, whoever it was, I'm not sure if it was Interscope, and make them squash it.  You know, like, when I had an artist that had a problem with an artist that I knew, they would have to get in a room, and we wasn't leaving until it was squashed, and I wasn't getting no more money with you until it was squashed.  I never, like, chose a side.  It was always about peace.  So, for me, in hip-hop, it was always about squashing beef.  I paused.  I squashed way more beef than anyone could ever even imagine.  You know what I'm saying?  It was always some kind of a competitive thing.  amongst the different crews.  And the crews were real.  We were authentic.  We were all from the same extreme circumstance.  So I knew what could happen if they went any further.  It would be dumbness.  And what happens when you're famous and influential and you do something foolish, a lot of people do something foolish.  So it's always important for us to do something smart, especially when we're at that platform where we're influencing other people.  So my point is, back in that day, I wish I could have got closer to him so I could have been able to understand his perspective a little better and talk him through whatever was going on and see what it was about.

So that's why you, on a social level, you always have to be conscious of what you promote and what you make money off of, especially when there's other people in problems.

And like I told you before, for $10,000, you could be the most famous person in the world.  $10,000 in publicists, you could be anywhere you want to be at any time.  But once you stop paying for it and, you know, the magazines or the platforms that are showcasing, you see that you get readers or you get the certain attention, they're going to put you in the newspaper any like they can, whether it's negative or positive.

I did that on my own.  I went to court.  While I was in court, your man Charlemagne and your man Wendy Williams, they shitted on me the whole time.  They bombed on me the whole time.  Every time there was something said about me in court, regardless of whether it was ridiculous or not, they were the main ones talking about it all the time.

            "text": "I mean, you know, I think it's gonna definitely set the stage for me to make other films because of the quality of it, me as a director, as a filmmaker.  See, that's another thing.  There's an expectation of me to be good at everything.  Like, I'm supposed to have more than one.  Like, Rachel Roy makes, not to talk to business, but it's a $50 million company at least on a bad day.  And unless I have five other companies that are doing that, I'm doing bad.  I can't just have one.  Mm.  You know, I have to have 10.  You know what I mean?  So as a mogul or in hip-hop, if you have only one company that's rolling, rolling, then you're not doing good, or at least if it's me, especially if you're an independent.  I guess if someone gives you a job and you have a great salary and you have one job, one great salary, and you're working for somebody, they give you all the praise in the world.  They make a person look like they're wealthier than they are.  What people don't understand is, to me, rich... is temporary.  But wealth is being able to have your children and grandchildren spend the money that you made and also be able to sustain.  Where generations can eat off the labor or the fruit of your labor.  That's wealth to me.  So at this point, it's not even about the immediate money or the car or whatever it is or the jury.  It's about how good my kids are doing.  It's about how good their kids are gonna do.  It's about the house you live in.  It's about the things that you can pass to your children and your children.  And that's what wealth is to me and that's what I'm trying to aggregate.  That's what I'm trying to put together.  I've been rich.  I can make quick money and I can spend quick money and I can loan out quick money that I'll never get back or get robbed for quick money.  You understand what I'm saying?  Or put a jury on my neck for quick money.  But how many people got businesses?  How many people got bricks?  Meaning houses and art and things that other people besides yourself can enjoy.  Being wealthy means looking out for other people before you look out for yourself.  So as long as my kids go to private school, you know, I'm wealthy.  But if I'm rich and I got a car, I can't afford to put my kid in school, I'm broke.  It makes no sense.  And how much of that goes on?  But then they're going to put you in the newspaper and say that you're rolling just because, you know, you have something that aesthetically you can see, but the stuff that really counts, nobody shows.

And also make sure you understand that the climb to the top is always tough.  You know, when you talk about having freedom, there's a price to be paid for freedom.  If you're not willing to pay the price, then you probably won't get it.  All right. ",
