            "text": "Hello, everybody.  Welcome to The Political Vigilante.  My name is Graham Elwood.  Thank you so much for getting your news here on YouTube and not through the corporate media.  So, obviously, the Jeffrey Epstein story is out.  He has gotten a sweetheart deal.  He was protected, basically, back in whatever it was, 2008. eight or nine or something like that.  And now it's coming to light.  He got arrested again.  Now he's being held and he's got ties to Trump, ties to Clinton.  And Chuck Schumer, Chucky the Shum, got thousands of dollars in donations from Jeffrey Epstein.  Wow.  Wait a minute, though.  But Chuck Schumer, he fights for us, right?  He's one of us, right?  He's said who called on Secretary Alexandria Acosta to resign and said President Trump should answer for his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.  Accepted thousands of dollars in donations from the alleged pedophile throughout the 90s.  So Acosta is the one who gave Epstein the sweetheart deal that basically gave him a slap on the wrist several years ago.  And now everybody, all the Democrats are calling to get Acosta out of there.  Acosta is not a fan of his at all.  But here's the thing, more typical, this is when you think the two parties are different, right?  So Trump said Epstein was a good guy back in 2002, and we share the same taste in young women, some creepy tweet like that.  But Bill Clinton then released a statement saying, I was only on his plane four times.  And it's like that.  right there, Clinton is a bold-faced liar.  Their flight manifests, Clinton has been on 26 of Epstein's planes.  26.  Does that mean he automatically was having sex with underage girls on his planes?  Maybe, maybe not.  But right there, Clinton's lying, which is, that's what, I mean, he just, he can't, I mean.  You ask Bill Clinton what time is it, there's gonna be a lie in there.  He just can't do anything without lying.  He's a pathological liar and a narcissist.  So he lied in his statement that he released a couple days ago.  They're all filthy liars.  They're all buddies.  It's a big club and you ain't in it, right?  That's what George Carlin said.  And Chuck Schumer's in this club.  Schumer received seven $1,000 donations from Epstein between 92 and 97, first as a U.S.  congressman from New York, and then when he was vying to be the state senator in 1998, an election he won.  Does this automatically make Schumer means that he's a pedophile?  No, I'm not saying that.  But if you're going to sit there and go after Acosta and Trump and Trump's relationship with Epstein, you're lying already.  You're already lying.  Look at this.  So we went to opensecrets.org, which is always very helpful.  92, 95, 95, 97, 97.  Money to candidates.  Jeffrey Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein  Co.,  and this is Epstein's company.  This is who it went to.  Schumer, Schumer, Schumer, a thousand bucks, right?  It's all on the internet, Chuck.  The New York Post came up with this.  And then I went to opensecrets.org and found this myself.  I'm a surfing comedian who's doing a show in his one-bedroom rent-controlled apartment.  I live in a rent-controlled apartment because both parties allowed the banks to steal my home, which is why both parties are maggot-ridden pieces of shit.  Fuck them and fuck their families.  Sorry for the bad language, kids.  Uncle Graham's angry because they stole his home and I gotta listen to this hypocritical nonsense.  Trump lies, Clinton lies, Chuck Schumer lies.  What else did Chuck Schumer get from his pedophile billionaire buddy?  He gave $10,000, Epstein did, to Victory in New York, a joint fundraising committee established by Schumer and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.  Boom.  Again, this is all online.  This is the receipt from the FEC, the Federal Elections Committee, the organization that oversees elections.  So if anybody, like if I were to have donated 10 grand to Chuck Schumer's campaign, it would say Graham Elwood, if any one of us do this, this is the receipt.  There it is.  Even more documents that are, again, online, on public websites.  This wasn't like some... Here it is, Jeffrey Epstein.  $5,000.  Win New York.  This is another one of Schumer's organizations.  Here it is.  Both parties, they're such filthy, despicable liars.  They don't even... And they just, Mr.  Trump, you need to answer for your relationship with him and Acosta.  Oh, what about this dude?  What's his response to this?  Well, you know, I mean, a lot of people donate to my campaign.  I can't keep track of.  You knew when somebody writes you a check for 10 grand, you know who they are.  Trust me.  Somebody writes you a check for 20 bucks, 100 bucks, whatever.  When this comes in, five grand, 10 grand comes in, you know who that is.  You know your campaign staff's job is to keep track of the names of the big donors.  And when a billionaire writes you checks for five and $10,000, you absolutely know who that guy is.  because you want a billionaire to write you more checks.  Or fly you around on a plane and have sex with children.  I don't know, whatever.  This is what he said.  Instead of prosecuting a predator and serial sex trafficker of children, Acosta chose to let him off easy, Schumer said on the floor.  Now, that's true.  Acosta did let him off easy.  But who's Schumer?  Who is Schumer to say?  Look at this.  Five here.  Ten here.  And then there's this one.  Seven here.  I'm telling you, One of you said you spoke with Wesley Clark Jr.  who said the tentacles of this sex trafficking ring, because here's the thing.  This is sex trafficking.  This isn't like one person, like a priest.  I mean, let's look at that.  Let's look at like when a priest was doing that and all the times that's come to light.  Other people knew about it.  Now you start talking about a sex trafficking ring?  That's a lot of people involved to do that.  That's a lot of people involved.  That's not like one or two creeps and nobody knew about it.  Everyone was like, God, I had no idea.  No, no, no.  Not in a sex trafficking ring.  So Jeffrey Epstein, and he's throwing out this kind of money?  You're honestly going to sit there and tell me that a guy that donates money to candidates?  None of these people who got jet rides, none of them?  I bet you they're all scurrying.  And guess what?  Here's the $10,000 one again.  Victory in New York.  Yeah, nice.  1998.  Way to go.  Let's just keep this up in the background.  A sex trafficking ring, there's a lot of people that have to know about it.  So there's this woman who is like a big ally of Jeffrey Epstein who's like his madam or whatever.  So she was doing that.  So here's a statistic.  45% of human traffickers are women.  One of the things they do is they lure young women in.  So like, cause if you're a young, attractive woman and you're sitting there eating alone and a guy comes up to you, you might be like, okay, yeah, nice try.  But a woman comes up and goes, oh, hey girlfriend, I love your bag or your hair is cute or whatever.  And you start talking to, oh, she's cool.  She's not gonna, she's not a threat to me.  That's by design.  Another woman doesn't seem like a threat to you.  She becomes friends.  Maybe you start hanging out over time and then, hey, my boyfriend's having a thing and then you get snatched up.  That's how that works.  And that's also.  the woman is used for small children.  Because some kid's lost and a nice attractive woman comes up, hey buddy, are you lost?  I'll help you find your parents.  Kid gets snatched up.  Human trafficking is a fucking horrible, horrible, horrible crime.  It is awful.  It is awful.  And it is a multi billion dollar industry.  It's an industry.  So that this guy can just throw money around.  So if you're going to make statements like this, Chuck Schumer, you better be, you better than you may be better ready to answer for this and this and this.  Because if you can't, then you got no business making these statements.  No business at all.  Typical sellout politician, sellout Democrat.  Mr.  Trump.  You're all part of it.  You're all part of the filthy, greedy, ruling class club.  And I hope the truth really comes out about this.  Because you'll find out.  Hillary will know.  I mean, Wasserman Schultz, anybody.  Kellyanne Conway, any of them.  Any of the powerful people, you're going to find out.  They knew, did nothing.  What I'm guessing is going to happen, Jeffrey Epstein may or may not get prosecuted.  he'll either get some sweetheart deal where he's gone or get some immunity thing that'll come in and there'll be some bullshit like, we're gonna protect the victims, you know, like Kamala Harris did when she was district attorney in San Francisco and didn't release the names of pedophile priests and her office claimed it was to protect the victims, which is like, why would the names of these priests, that doesn't mean anything.  Hold these priests accountable.  Because the Catholic Archdiocese has a lot of money and they made sure that the names stayed sealed.  So it'll either be something like that, or Jeffrey Epstein will have some horrific accident in prison.  They'll just release him out into gen pop one day, knowing full well he's going to get shanked.  Because if he has information that's going to implicate all these people, because that's the only bargaining chip Epstein's going to be able to have, let me tell you this right now, is if he has physical evidence.  He can't just say, oh, Bill Clinton did this on my plane, and so he has to have physical evidence, which he probably has.  And all of these powerful people that have been doing business with him and all of the ones that are pedophiles and knew about he was pedophiles, they are terrified that he's going to go public.  But what's horrifying, if billionaires are doing this, if billionaires are doing this, that means they own politicians.  That means there's other politicians who have been doing this or knew about it or paid off to shut it or profited from it.  If you... don't have sex with a child but you profit from it, you are equally a piece of shit.  Because you knew about an awful thing happening that you could have prevented and you didn't.  So you're awful and you need to blow your head off.  Admit your crimes first and then blow your head off.  So that's what I think of the Democratic Party and Chuck Schumer and the filthy Republican Party.  Both parties, the ruling class, this is the ruling class.  This is what the ruling class is and does.  Whatever they want.  So that's the resistance to Trump.  Epstein is given, and buddies with both parties, filthy pedophile billionaire.  Hey, he's got money, so who cares?  As long as he's donating my campaign and flying me around, what do I care?  what he does?  That's the attitude of the filthy ruling class.
