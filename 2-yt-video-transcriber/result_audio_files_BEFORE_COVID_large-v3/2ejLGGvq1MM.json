            "text": "My video for February the 23rd, 2019 is video number 3005 and the title is a question.  What does the gold fringe on US flags mean?  Last night I attended another wonderful concert by the Melbourne Municipal Band at the Melbourne Auditorium.  I imagine it's been that way for a long time, but it never drew my attention before.  When I got home, I looked it up to refresh my memory as to the meaning.  The gold fringe is a mutation of the actual flag, and it represents martial law.  Judge Napolitano should know that, but calling what Trump is doing in regard to Gitmo and military tribunals unconstitutional overreach is absurd.  The corporate government has been overstepping its lawful bounds most of U.S.  history.  The money masters from the Vatican and City of London have played the insidious game for centuries.  I will provide a link so that those who want to know more can read it for themselves.  For me, I live my life with a vision to expose and hopefully reverse the corruption I see in the world around me.  Will our creator ever take action?  Will humanity actually experience the kingdom of heaven on earth in my lifetime?  I cannot see that happening without full disclosure of the scam and the administration of real justice with mercy.  Where's the love?  Oh, where's the love?  Black Eyed Peas song.  I think that was the name of the group.  Anyway, Yes, my friend Robin is one of the musicians that plays, she plays percussions, and I guess it was a clarinet, if I'm not mistaken, and perhaps other instruments too.  Quite a few people that I know, including my own son and people in his band, play multiple instruments.  But the concert was good, but as I'm sitting there, and as I watch the young kids would march in with the flag and raise the I don't know.  they have the two weapons and they raise the arms but the flag was that they were marching in with was gold fringed and the flag on display on the left side facing the stage on the left side of the stage which is actually the right side of the stage from the stage point of view it's gold fringed too and I'm not sure that ever caught my attention before, but it really caught my attention.  Uh, as I viewed that, uh, again, last night, and again, this video is made, it'll go up tomorrow.  So it'll be not last night, but the night before last, by the time the video goes live anyway, uh, you know, somebody made a suggestion on the video that went current today.  Ron, explain more about yourself.  And one of my longtime friends said, Ron has made over 3,000 videos.  If you want to know more about his history, watch his videos.  And I reveal a lot of things.  And it's not a mystery, it shouldn't be a mystery to anybody, that I was the Secretary of State of the attempt to reestablish a lawful government, not a legal government, but a lawful government.  Judge Napolitano seems to have the idea that Trump's building the wall is somehow an unconstitutional act.  Well, he did want Mexico to pay for it, and Mexico refused, and uh and he did say well okay we need the.  some of those security people say we need a big fence that we can see through see what's coming from the other side and the wall instead of going over the whole u.s mexican border has been reduced in size according to judge napolitano.  now i don't know how much of that is true but when judge napolitano calls something unconstitutional overreach.  And that's the words that apparently, that's the title.  That's the title of the article that I looked at.  My God, talk about unconstitutional overreach.  Our government has been doing that to us for a long, long, long time.  And the gold fringe means that you are not, you are not a human being with natural rights, you are actually not even a citizen of anything and you're in a maritime court and the presiding officer over the court as judge has virtual unlimited rights.  They try to operate within within the law to the extent possible, but the law is fluid and flexible so that people that don't have wealth and clout in the system, they are treated very differently than those that play roles to empower the system of corruption.  And again, it's the three city states, District of Columbia, the Vatican, and the City of London.  And I'm not talking about London, the whole city, I'm talking about the center of the city, the ancient part of the city, if you will, the part where the Rothschilds sit.  And they're the ones, the money masters are the ones that have ruled the roost, not just in Europe and America, but all over the planet.  They are the warmongers because war is... is a most profitable business for them.  And these are things that I've been trying to get out to people in all the while that I've been doing these daily videos.  I mean, I thought I was gonna take a break, but how can I take a break?  There still isn't any change.  that's significant.  And my life is about being, hopefully I'd like to be a participant in some of the changes.  i'd like the rv to actually happen so that i could have resources and and play a role in helping the the impoverished people of the earth and haiti and and places in the western and other parts of the world and africa and and whatnot where people have been suppressed for so long and not given their rights where the their wealth the wealth of the countries.  and Africa is a rich continent in natural resources.  But most of that has been stolen by people that live in Eurasia, Europe and Asia.  And it's not even beneficial to the people that actually live in Africa.  And I'd like to see.  Zimbabwe is supposed to be one of the wealthiest deposits of minerals in you know, on the planet.  Now, in diamonds and gold and other precious metals and things like that.  So the Zim is supposed to be very valuable.  Well, are the people that have high ideals and want to do honest things and help uplift humanity, are they ever going to be empowered to do so?  Or is it going to be just more of the rich Trumps of the world and others that have played a clandestine role in suppressing humanity and keeping humanity ignorant.  You know, the gold flags is just a small indication of a problem, but I'm in favor of martial law if it's going to bring down the criminal operations.  I want to see it happen, and I want to see it happen as soon and as quickly as it possibly can happen.  I don't know what that means.  I'd like to see divine intervention.  I don't know that I will.  I'd like to live to see the kingdom of heaven on earth.  I'm not sure I will.  Those are my dreams since childhood.  And I don't need to go in and rehash everything for somebody that hasn't been watching my videos.  And I was so happy to see that pointed out by the lady who responded to the gentleman, I'm assuming, that wanted me to share my history with him or her.  Anyway, folks, there's a lot that we need to know.  And I wish we could start communicating with each other on the subjects that really matter.  Thank you for listening and namaste. ",
