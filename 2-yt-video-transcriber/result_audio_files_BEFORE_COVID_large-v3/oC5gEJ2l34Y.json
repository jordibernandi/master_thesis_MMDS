            "text": "Absolutely.  You get the C.S.  Lewis Institute working on all these things.  Right.  One, two, three, four questions on Genesis.  What a surprise.  I'm not going to say a lot about Genesis because I'd just say what's the most frequent question and that is by far the most frequent question in different versions of it and it disturbs people and I love this country and its young people.  and so in order to deal with this I actually was so moved by young Christians who were very bright And we're told in their churches that if they didn't believe a certain view of Genesis, they weren't really Christian.  I come from the very city in Ireland where that view came from.  So I feel a certain responsibility.  And so I've written a book on this.  And it's called Seven Days That Divide the World.  and read it carefully because I am convinced, just let me make it absolutely clear, the full inspiration of Scripture and in the importance of theology and the historicity of Genesis.  So that I'm not writing from a kind of science trumps everything viewpoint.  I explain how I think about controversy in this book before we go into any detail.  To start on that tonight, I need at least an hour to approach that question.  So if you don't mind, I'll leave you to look at it.  And it's because I believe very strongly in Genesis and the way it's structured that I've come to tentative conclusions.  I wouldn't die for them, although you may well want me to when you've read the book.  But that's a different matter.  But let me just deal with one simple thing.  And the simple thing is the idea that you must take the Bible literally.  There is no one in the world, no Christian that does that.  Jesus said, I am the door.  You don't take that literally, do you?  Why don't you?  Because you know a little bit of general facts about doors.  Now here's the mistake, and this is Lewis again, this is language.  Jesus is not a literal door.  He's a real door though.  It's a metaphor.  But as Lewis points out, metaphors stand for reality.  Jesus is a real door into a real spiritual experience of God.  It's literal at that level.  Our problem is that the word literal is virtually useless.  Because as we look at language, if I say I watched Joel yesterday flying down the road in his car, would you take that literally?  Now be careful.  Because it's a metaphor for something literal.  That is driving fast.  Do you see that?  And Joel is very literal, as you see.  And so is his car, and so is the road.  It's complex.  I often joke with people, you know, who ask me that, and they're sitting beside me in an aircraft.  Do you take the Bible literally or spiritually?  And I say, Israel was a land flowing with milk and honey.  Do you take that literally?  When the Israelites arrived, a great sticky ball of milk and honey came flowing down the main street.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  You take it spiritually.  Israel was a land full of the milk of the Word and the honey of the Holy Spirit.  It's neither.  It's a metaphor.  Israel, a literal country.  There was milk and honey because there were real literal cows and real literal bees.  The metaphor is in the word flowing.  So you have literal concepts connected by a metaphor.  We all know that.  We do it every day long.  And when it comes to the Bible, we don't allow it.  That's just nonsense, folks.  That's childish.  We've got to realize that the Bible is full of metaphors.  But the mistake we make, as Lewis pointed out, is we tend to think that if they're metaphors, They can't be real or literal.  Take Genesis 1, and God said.  What do you think that means?  Has God a voice box and lungs like we've got?  No.  His spirit.  So what does the word said mean when attributed to God?  It certainly doesn't mean the same as it does when attributed to us.  It is a metaphor, but for something that we can't even begin to understand.  It tells us about communication, the word.  But it's not to be understood literalistically in terms of a voice box and lungs and the motion of air.  And the book is full of that kind of stuff.  And until we get used to that, we're going to stumble where we needn't stumble at all.  Do you take the days literally?  The word day has four meanings in Genesis 1.  Did you know that?  If you don't, have a look.  And I'm going to leave that there.  I think scripture is much richer than we think.  And the wonderful thing about it is you can come to an understanding of how rich it is.  that confirms your confidence and inspiration.  That's why I wrote the book, not to disaffirm that. ",
