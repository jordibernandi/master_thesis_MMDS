            "text": "I was leaving the Walmart near my home recently when this happened.  A black kid about 12 years old was teaching his little brother how to sell chocolate bars to people leaving the store.  As I passed, the smaller boy walked toward me with the box of chocolate bars held out.  He was giving his pitch, but he was looking back at his big brother.  The brother then scolded him, don't look at me, look at him.  I have no doubt whatsoever that both of these boys have heard that word thousands of times, but I would bet a pallet load of those chocolate bars that neither has ever heard it used by a white person.  When I was their age, if I had said that word with an earshot of my parents, either one of them would have slapped my mouth shut.  To the best of my knowledge, I've never used that word except in a discussion about that word.  I'm not sure that I've ever heard it used by any of my working class buddies when I was growing up either.  We loved soul music too much to ever be racist.  We'll have to bleep that word out on this video and the video will almost certainly be demonetized as punishment for even talking about it.  Growing up, the only times I could remember hearing the word was in the rare Hollywood movie portraying the evils of bigotry, until two cultural phenomena arrived, rap music and the deaf comedy jam.  From then on, I couldn't escape hearing it, but it wasn't being used by white people.  A decade or so ago, I got the urge to do stand-up comedy.  I hit open mics all over LA, at least twice a week for six months or so.  One of the places I went, a coffee house called Bliss, was the hangout of a bunch of African-American comics.  They all used the N-word freely, as an epithet, like the boy at Walmart had, but also as a fondness, as in, mind it.  or an expression of exasperated disbelief, please, or just as a general description in a bit where whites and blacks were compared for comedic effect.  White dudes be like, fill in the blank, and be like, fill in the blank.  You'd be hard pressed to make the case that these comedians were in any way shocked or outraged by that word.  They used it as casually as I would say hello.  Once, after hearing them joke about how racist whites were for several weeks, I took the stage and said, hey guys, sorry I'm late.  Man, it's tough to get here in traffic after spending a long day oppressing black people.  I finally had to put the white privilege light on my roof and run the siren.  There were a few seconds of stunned silence and then one of the better comics laughed, pointed at me and said, this is all right.  They knew I was busting their balls and they were fine with that.  But never in a million years would I have gotten away with using the N-word.  One of the hallmarks of the American left is that they love to set traps.  They love to set up one standard of language and then, as soon as everybody gets used to that, flip it around and punish those who can't keep up.  After white liberals stole the civil rights movement to be used for their own virtue signaling, they took to messing with the language in that arena.  We were told that the perfectly respectful term Negro was no longer acceptable.  presumably because the N-word is a corruption of Negro.  So we had to dump them both, and colored person also had to go.  We were to use black people or black Americans, then that switched to Afro-Americans, and soon that switched to African-Americans.  Black and African-American became the standard.  But many on the left began to push for a new term, a more inclusive term.  They came up with person of color.  That's the new favorite.  But please don't slip and say colored person.  That would be racist.  I'm waiting to be told that I can't say blue sky because the accepted term is sky of blue.  The game, of course, is control.  The left is comprised of control freaks and change junkies.  I'm not talking about liberals here.  I'm talking about hard left progressive activists.  They feel compelled to change everything and to force you to accept it.  And the constant shifting of language regarding race is one of the ways they keep you off balance.  They want you to fear them, to get their approval before you do or say anything.  And they want you to hear the N-word so often that you might accidentally use it.  People pick up language and repeat it.  Know any Joe Rogan fans?  They all say, 100%, anytime they want to stress a point.  Joe says it, they picked it up, and it spread all over.  That's how language works.  If people get Grammy Awards for songs full of the N-word and all sorts of violent and misogynistic language, a kid might forget that these words are forbidden.  They might slip out once in a while.  We're not machines.  We're only human.  100%.  By the way, the Grammy Awards were this week, and Cardi B won for Best Rap Album.  She was also nominated for Best Rap Song, Be Careful With Me, which featured four S-bombs, three F-bombs, and one MF-bomb.  And she used the N-word six times, each time as an angry epithet toward a lover who we might assume is black.  Remember when homosexuals decided they would outlaw the word queer?  They replaced it, weirdly enough, with gay.  And then a couple of decades later, they suddenly started calling each other queer again.  But we're still not allowed to.  And now the trans people are playing that game too.  All of these people are official victim groups for the left, and they're all moving the tiles around in a game of oppression scrabble.  But I digress.  I used to drink at a bar in Long Beach, and I was friends with the bouncer.  One night he wore a beautiful blue shirt, and I complimented him.  He said, I'm sick of being told that a Negro can't wear blue.  I was startled.  Could a person still use the term Negro?  Was I even allowed to hear that word?  Later, after I moved here to my little multiracial town, a black friend of mine showed up in his Volvo station wagon wearing the sort of canvas hat favored by elderly white men on fishing trips.  He explained the car and hat by saying, I'm going incognito.  He was joking about the constant talk of black people being rousted by traffic cops.  These friends of mine didn't play into the racial separatism so popular on the left.  They were too smart to fall into that trap.  It pains me to say this, but the left wants black people marginalized.  They need them to be both a monolithic voting bloc and to serve forever as examples of the oppression that they claim to be fighting.  Progressives have no reason to exist politically other than to battle oppressors on the behalf of the oppressed.  And so they not only allow blacks to use the N-word with impunity, they actively encourage it.  They know that white kids buy as much rap and hip-hop as black kids.  They know that these white kids will hear the N-word constantly.  That ugly word will embed itself in the brains of kids from all ethnic groups.  The white kids will try their best never to use it, and the black kids will use it whenever they want to.  This will make interaction between the races that much harder, because even if the whites do manage to suppress a word they hear all the time, they'll always be walking on eggshells, and all involved will constantly be reminded of the troubled history of race in America.  That word creates tension where no tension needs to be.  If the N-word really is degrading, which I think it is, then let's stop participating in this racialist bullshit being perpetrated by black people who have been trained by white progressives to use race as a bludgeon.  Let's call a spade a spade here.  Wait, we can't edit that out, right?  Let's cut the crap here.  This might be the least racist country on earth.  If a word is too nasty for me to ever use it under any circumstances, it's surely too nasty to be used by a 12-year-old to shame his seven-year-old brother.  Next time I hear a black kid use that word, I'm going to correct him or her, just as I would if I heard a white kid use it, which is very unlikely.  What was wrong with the term Negro?  Nothing.  What's wrong with Caucasian?  Calling people black and white makes us sound like we're opposites of each other as opposed to having slight variations from one another.  It's really sad that we're stuck in this black-white thing.  There are long-term historical connotations to the color black and the color white.  People wear black at funerals and white at weddings.  The bad guys wear black hats and the good guys wear white hats.  When somebody died, Congress people used to wear black armbands.  When they want to look pure and virtuous at the State of the Union, they dress up all in white.  Using these inaccurate terms subconsciously propagates the idea that white is somehow positive and black is somehow negative.  That's got to get into a person's head too.  That's got to trigger defensiveness from time to time.  Eventually we're going to need better terminology.  Look, it's never going to be easy to make race insignificant as long as the left insists that race is the most important thing.  But it's Black History Month and we have to at least try to fix this stuff.  How about we start by insisting that all people who use the N-word need to just knock that shit off. ",
