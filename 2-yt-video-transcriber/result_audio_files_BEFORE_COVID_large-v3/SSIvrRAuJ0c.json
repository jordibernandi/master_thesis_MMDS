            "text": "Hey, my name is Tommy DelVecchio DiBenedetto, and I was Jerry Epstein's security guard at the Metropolitan Detention Center.  A lot of people online are trying to pin this on the fucking Clintons.  Let me tell you, man, they're good fucking people.  They love this guy.  They visited him three times this week in the middle of the fucking night because they didn't want to make a big deal out of it.  Because they're fucking humble.  You should have seen Hillary Clinton when she saw him.  It was like a fucking dog that had just, you know, when their owner's in Iraq and he comes back.  She just fucking lunged at him.  She went right for him.  I had to fucking pull her off him.  She was so fucking excited.  They fucking loved each other.  Sometimes that's what happens on Suicide Watch.  People commit suicide.  That's why they're called Suicide Watch.  The Clintons, man, they gave a fuck about this guy.  They were like a fucking family.  I mean, the night he died, they were here praying with him.  They looked like they were drinking, like, wine and some dark red liquid in a chalice, and they were all fucking chanting in the cell together.  It was fucking beautiful.  I didn't even know why he was fucking in here.  I thought it was like he hired some illegals, you know, because he's got, like, an all-inclusive in the Bahamas.  But my friend said he had underage girls in there.  And I said, you know, my cousin had that fucking problem.  But you know what he did?  He found a girl that looked young but was really old as shit.  You know those girls that, like, look 14 but they're 40?  You go and see their face, it's, like, real rough.  The skin by the creases of their mouth is, like, raw.  But, you know, you know I'm fucking with you, Donna.  You know I fucking love you.  You saved that man's life.  He wasn't a bad dude, Jerry Epstein, you know?  He's not a bad fucking dude. ",
