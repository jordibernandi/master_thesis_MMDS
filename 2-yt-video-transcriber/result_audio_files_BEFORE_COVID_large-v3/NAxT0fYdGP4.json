            "text": "Hello friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor.  I want to welcome you to our Friday night Bible question of the week, where we're going to be talking about, is it a sin for a Christian to eat pork?  Well, maybe.  The Bible's pretty clear that we should not be eating pork.  Of course, there's going to be thousands of people in heaven that maybe did not understand the truth about things like smoking.  Who was it?  John Newton.  He smoked cigars and he wrote Amazing Grace, but they didn't know.  And Martin Luther drank beer.  But if I drank beer, it'll be a sin.  And then there are going to be people who will be in heaven that maybe ate pork because they don't know that the Bible commands us not to.  Let me read it to you from Leviticus chapter 11.  And I'll start with the first verse.  Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them, Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the animals that you may eat among the animals that are on the earth.  And he goes through a list, I'll not read the whole chapter, of those that are clean and those that are unclean.  Among the unclean animals, you read in verse 7, And the swine, though it divides the hoof and has cloven hoofs, it does not chew the cud, it is unclean to you.  Their flesh you will not eat, their carcass you will not touch, they are unclean to you.  The criteria for being clean or unclean among the animals was the animal must chew the cud like a goat or a cow or a sheep and have a divider or a cloven hoof.  Pigs have got the cloven hoof, but they're scavengers.  They don't chew the cud.  Camel chews the cud, but he's got a paw.  They are unclean.  That's why Jesus made fun of the scribes and Pharisees that would strain the water to make sure they didn't get a gnat, but they'd eat camel steak.  He said, you strain a gnat, you swallow a camel.  So yes, the Bible is pretty clear that some animals are clean and some animals were considered unclean.  And you might be thinking, well, Pastor Doug, those are laws for the Jews.  I would ask the question, why would God want Jews to be healthier than other people?  And if you look in Genesis, you'll find out that God made this distinction for all humans because everybody listening to me right now, we're brothers and sisters because we're all related to Noah.  Now, God told Noah when he brought the animals on the ark.  You can read in Genesis 7, 2, of every clean animal, you are to bring them in by sevens.  The unclean animal, they were to bring by twos, the male and his female.  Then after the flood, Noah built an altar and he took of all the clean animals and sacrificed to the Lord.  You are never to sacrifice an unclean animal to God.  That would have been an abomination.  And then because all the vegetation had been destroyed by the flood, at that time, as an emergency, man was permitted to eat of the clean animals.  In the beginning, God didn't want man to eat any animals, let alone pigs, which are scavengers.  You read in Genesis 1, God says in verse 29, See, I have given you every herb that yields seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree in whose fruit yields its seed, to you it shall be for food.  The best diet for people is a vegetarian diet.  But God said as an emergency that he would allow them to eat meats, but those are the meats that God has prescribed could be clean.  animals clove and hoof chew the cut.  if it was in the waters it needed to have fins and scales among the birds.  they needed to be your foraging birds as opposed to your your raptors and your scavengers like the buzzard and the hawk and so forth.  they could eat the chicken and the dove and the turkey so forth the foraging birds.  so God gave some criteria that if man is going to eat meat, they must be the clean meats.  In heaven, of course, we're all vegetarians.  We're eating from the tree of life.  The lions are vegetarians in heaven.  So this is God's original plan.  But of all the things that a person might eat that the Bible says are forbidden, pork is really the most abominable.  Pigs are scavengers.  I've got a little report here from Consumer Report, and this is actually January 2013.  What's in that pork?  And basically the article goes through saying 70% of all pork that they tested in the slaughterhouses is contaminated with everything from the Staphylococcus to... Yersinia, to Lystra, and not to mention Trichina.  And they say that some of the bacteria that we found in 198 samples proved to be resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat people.  Why?  Because they're giving the pigs these antibiotics all the time.  It is definitely not clean.  Also in the slaughterhouses, The brains are normally sterile, but during the slaughtering process, meat can become contaminated with bacteria from the animal's skin or gut and from the worker's equipment or the environment.  Contamination is especially likely to occur if processing lines run too fast.  In fact, they tell you in this article that you should be very careful not to store your pork next to anything else.  Keep your uncooked pork away from other foods because it is swimming in parasites and bacteria.  A lot of people that eat pork have, I think it's 30% higher chance that they're gonna get cancer.  Not just pork, but other meats, as opposed to a vegetarian.  God made some animals that are scavengers in the sky.  They're called buzzards.  There are scavengers in the waters.  They are catfish and sharks.  And there are scavengers on the land.  They are pigs and dogs.  And the Bible says that we are not to eat them.  Matter of fact, God describes you know, the vilest thing.  He says, the pig that was washed is gone to return to why? ",
