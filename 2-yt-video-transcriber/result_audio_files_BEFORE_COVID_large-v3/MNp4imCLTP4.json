So, can I get a loan?  I don't know, you're a frog.  Well, I want a loan.  What's your name?  Kermit.  You're not Kermit the Frog.  No, no, no.  I was named after him.  The name's Kermit Jagger.  My father's Mick Jagger, and my mother's a frog.  He fucked a frog.  And I'm his offspring.  Well, anyways, I want a loan for a lily pad.  Well, you can't, I don't know if you can have one.  Do you have any collateral?  Well, I have this.  The frog pulls out a little shiny pink elephant, you know, and a little shiny pink elephant.  So Mrs.  Whack looks at it, and her name's Patty.  I don't think this is much collateral, you know, but I'll talk to the bank manager about it, you know.  It's a Frog out there, Kermit Jagger, gave me this damn thing.  Did you know, have any idea what this is?  The bank manager says, what is this?  This is a knick-knack, Paddy Whack.  Give the frog a loan.  His old man's a rolling stone. ",
