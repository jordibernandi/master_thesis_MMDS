            "text": "This is the funniest thing.  Democrats are the most predictable people on the planet.  If President Trump says anything, they automatically throw a hissy fit.  Like, President Trump could offer them an ice cream cone, and they'd be like, nuh-uh.  This happened yesterday when President Trump tweeted about One America News Network.  The president tweeted, and I quote here, also, congratulations to OANN on the great job you're doing and the big ratings jump.  Thank you, President Trump.  First of all, thank you, Mr.  President.  Thank you for watching.  We're really proud of what we do here.  We work hard, and we appreciate you watching.  And then, like clockwork, the knee-jerk reaction from the left.  If President Trump likes ice cream, the left thinks it's gross.  So liberal outlet Vox published an article yesterday about us titled, The Other Conservative News Network.  Trump Keeps Tweeting About Explained.  In this piece, Vox pretends they know our ratings.  They don't, and our ratings are skyrocketing, thank you very much.  And they hurl a bunch of false accusations at us in a blatant attempt to damage our credibility.  So let's do what we do best.  Let's debunk a few of the garbage leftist talking points in this piece.  Vox writes, emails obtained by the Washington Post indicate that shortly after Trump announced his candidacy, OANN executive producer Lindsay Oakley directed staff to, quote, always take the Trump speeches live in their entirety.  Adding that, quote, Trump is being treated unfairly by the mainstream media and we need to provide the other side.  Not to mention we have loyal viewers that tune in specifically to see the Trump speeches live because no one else carries them.  We also see some of our highest ratings during the Trump speeches.  Oh, dear God.  How is this a scandal?  All news networks see high ratings when they carry Trump's speeches, and the mainstream media is unfair to Trump.  It's absolutely hilarious that an effort to, quote, provide the other side is a scandal to the left.  The Washington Post's outrage about providing both sides of the story, that tells you more about the bias of the mainstream media than anything else.  Then the Vox article attacks me specifically for exposing Planned Parenthood's cover-up of the statutory rape of underage girls.  Vox writes, quote, More recently, OANN has come under scrutiny for pushing conspiracy theories about Planned Parenthood.  No, Vox, we didn't come under scrutiny.  Media Matters, funded by George Soros, tried to publish a hit piece debunking my claims about Planned Parenthood, but court records prove that I am correct.  In fact, just last week, when Pennsylvania Representative Brian Sims bullied and threatened to dox teenage girls at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia, the largest Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia, That provided another piece of evidence that I am correct.  That Planned Parenthood clinic has been cited by the Pennsylvania Department of Health for failing to report the statutory rape of an 11-year-old girl.  Planned Parenthood clinics all over the country have neglected to report the rape of children.  Girls raped by their soccer coaches.  Girls who reported that they were sex trafficked.  One girl who asked for help reporting.  and Planned Parenthood did not do it.  Read the court records yourself.  Then Vox slams OANN for covering the FBI abuse of power that led to the Russia probe.  Vox calls this a conspiracy theory and says, quote, there is still no credible evidence that anyone associated with Trump was improperly surveilled during the 2016 election.  Yeah, OK, we know the FBI spied on Trump's campaign because they admitted it themselves.  And then the attorney general confirmed it.  And you can play all the word games you want, but when the FBI wiretaps a member of a presidential campaign and sends in an undercover operative to get information, yeah, that's called spying.  And the whole thing was based on the phony, salacious, unverified political opposition dossier compiled by Christopher Steele and paid for by Hillary Clinton.  So yeah, I'd say that spying is improper surveillance.  So as you can see, Vox wrote this lame hit piece because they suffer from Trump derangement syndrome, not because they're interested in the facts or the news.  We here at One America News are the only network who isn't afraid to report the truth.  So thank you, Mr.  President, for watching our channel, and thanks to all of our viewers who make us who we are.  And thanks, too, to the haters who make our ratings go up every single day.  And that is my final point. ",
