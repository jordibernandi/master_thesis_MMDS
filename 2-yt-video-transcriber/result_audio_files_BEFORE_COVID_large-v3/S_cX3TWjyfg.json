Forbes, the left-wing pinko commie publication that is Forbes magazine.  Black homebuyers denied mortgages more than twice as often as whites, reports finds.  Black and Hispanic homebuyers are significantly more likely to get turned down for conventional mortgage loan, according to new data.  A recent analysis from Zillow shows that in 2016, nearly 21% of black applicants were denied a conventional loan, while 15.5% of Hispanics were.  Those rates are down from 2007 when black applicants were turned down 34%.  4.3% of the time, and Hispanics face denials on 30% of applications.  34.3%.  So you had a one in three chance of getting denied, basically.  The national denial rate is down, dropping from 18% to 9.8%.  But even with those reduction rates in the past decade, a major gap exists between loan denials for white and Asian applicants and those of black and Hispanic applicants.  In 2016, Asian applicants were denied a conventional loan in the 10.4% of cases.  White's 8.1%.  So, yeah, that's what I would probably call privilege. ",

And, of course, it's not like there's statistical analysis on any of this, but there is a phenomenon, and I'm going to use Wikipedia Andy for this, shopping while black.  A phrase commonly used for the type of marketplace discrimination that is also known as consumer racial profiling.  Consumer racism, racial profiling in a retail setting.  And while this individual hasn't experienced it, some notable celebrities are... Oh no, R. Kelly.  I'm already debunking myself in real time.  Oprah Winfrey.  She told Good Housekeeping Magazine how she and other black companions were turned away from a store while white people were being allowed in.  Allegedly, when she and her friend recommended the clerks black transsexuals who had entered early and tried to rob it.  What?  Oprah, what has happened?  And in 2005, Winfrey also refused service at a Parisian luxury store, Hermes, as the store was closing for the evening in what a spokesperson described as Oprah's crash moment, a reference to a 2004 movie about racial and social tensions in Los Angeles.  And outside of this, there's obviously statistical analysis that, yes, they are profiled.  There's a huge problem of profiling. ",

At least one crucial area.  Jobs.  A new study by researchers at Northwestern University, Harvard, and the Institute for Social Research in Norway looked at the available field experiment on hiring discrimination from 1989 through 2015.  The researchers found that anti-black racism in hiring is unchanged since at least 1989, while anti-Latino racism may have decreased modestly.  They looked at two kinds of experiments, resume and in-person audits.  In the first, researchers send out resumes with similar levels of education, experience, and so on, but the names differ, so some resumes have a stereotypically black or Latino name, and the others have a stereotypically white name.  In the second, applicants go in person to apply for the job.  They each share similar qualifications, but some are white while others are black or brown.  In total, researchers produced 24 studies with 30 estimates of discrimination for Black and Latino Americans, collectively representing more than 54,000 applications submitted for more than 25,000 positions.  They concluded that on average, white applicants received 36 more callbacks than equally qualified African Americans, while white applicants on average received 24% more qualified than Latinos. ",
