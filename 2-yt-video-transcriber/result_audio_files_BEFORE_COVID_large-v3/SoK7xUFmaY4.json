He's a supporter of Al-Qaeda and Hamas.  He's come out and said that.  And the connection, why this is so interesting, is because he spoke at Obama's 2012 DNC, not the actual convention.  It was a week before they had the first ever Juma, it's Arabic for gathering at the DNC.  And he was the keynote speaker at this the three Islamic-centered event beginning with a Friday afternoon prayer and sermon and Islamic banquet and an all-day Islamic festival.  And he was the grand imam for this event.  So this man who was training school shooters' father is a huge tie to Barack Obama.  And you say, why is that a big deal?  That's because the rate of mass shootings tripled under Obama.  I only went back as far as Reagan.  But Reagan in eight years had 31.  Bush in four years had 18.  Clinton in eight years had 54.  Bush in eight years had 49.  And Barack Obama in eight years had 132.  This is the guy who constantly pushed gun control.  Every time there was a mass shooting, gun control, gun control, gun control, gun control.  Who was just linked to a compound that... where they were training school shooters.  Not only did this get minimal coverage, but no one will tell you they never fully investigated that place because it was bulldozed right away.  Authorities came right on set and said, oh, we didn't get a chance to do a full investigation there because someone bulldozed the site.  You can't make this stuff up.

This next one comes to us straight from the WikiLeaks, an email from Fred Burton, where he stated, I think Obama spent about $65,000 on taxpayers money flying in pizza and dogs from Chicago.  Now, unless those pizza and dogs were made of gold, I think it's pretty safe to say that they're using code for something.  And that's when a lot of people chimed in and said that the FBI's only pedo code is young boy hot dog, young girl pizza.  So, I mean, I think that $65,000 mark makes a little more sense now.  Which brings us to clip number five.  Is Obama gay?  And do you think that the country will see the first, the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?  Well, we already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down.  Got it.  No, Michelle is a trans.  I'm sorry, she's a what?  A transgender.  We all know.  Oh my gosh.

I performed fellatio on Senator Obama in the limousine during the time Senator Obama was smoking crack cocaine, after which I had the driver take me to my hotel, the Comfort Suites, Gurnee, Illinois.

This guy's got a full lifetime of talking out of both sides of his mouth with everything shrouded in secrecy.  But I'll tell you what's not a lie, so much so that even Snopes of all people was forced to admit it was true, is that in 1991 when they were shopping his book around, part of his bio stated that he was born in Kenya.  It says, born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.  Indonesia, which is right in line with what his former roommate said, Andrew Basiago, and quote, the Barack Obama I knew was known by his Indonesian name, Baris Satoro, saying how he was a Muslim and that he had revealed to him that he was a lifelong member of the sect of Islam founded by a man named Muhammad Sabud in Indonesia and a Muslim splinter group with about 20,000 members worldwide known as Sabud for its founder.  which then led people to notice a very interesting thing about Mohamed Saboud and Barry Satoro.  They look exactly alike, which would explain the complete secrecy with his birth certificate.  The fact that we had a president that had not produced a birth certificate is mind-blowing.  But one man stayed on him about this birth certificate.  That man is named Donald Trump, and he continually on several occasions said, Pressed him.  Where is the birth certificate?  Where is the birth certificate?  So finally, on April 27, 2011, Obama releases a birth certificate three years after he was elected president.  And immediately, the very next day, people started ripping it to shreds, citing instance after instance why this was not real.  And you say, why wasn't this bigger news?  Why wasn't this a huge thing?  I remember him releasing his birth certificate real quick, and then that was it.  It was over.  Because what you don't remember is that immediately, only a few days later, after he had released his birth certificate, he then did this.  Good evening. ",

Fox News let the bag out.  only a few months after September 11th, reporting that he had already died.  Osama bin Laden had died a peaceful death due to an untreated lung complication, the Pakistan observer reported.  So now this is completely out of everyone's memory.  As soon as it came in, right in a week, completely flat-tired, everything Trump did, For years, trying to get him to release it, he finally releases it, and what does he do?  Flat tires it with the biggest drop you could have in your arsenal, capturing Bin Laden, supposedly, even though Fox already reported him dead, and there was no pictures and no evidence.  Oh, and wouldn't you look here?  The health director who approved Obama's birth certificate dies in a plane crash.  And everyone else in that plane crash lived, but somehow she was the only one to die.  Which leads us to the final example of why Barrister Toro is the shadiest president of all time.  And for this one, we'll be going right to the Bible.  Luke 10.18.  And he said unto them, this is Jesus talking, And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.  And you say, what does that have to do with Barack Obama?  Well, Barack Obama wasn't born Barack Obama.  He was Barry Satoro.  He personally changed his name to Barack Obama, who he tells us is his father, which we know it's.  Muhammad Sabud is his father.  So what does he mean when he says he's my father?  Well, Barack in Hebrew means lightning, and Obama means of a high place of worship.  Lightning from a high place of worship.  And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.  So he changed his name to Barack Obama after his father, Satan.  Now you could say that's just a coincidence.  Maybe that is just a coincidence.  I don't know.  All I know is that this is a man who changed his name to the Hebrew meaning for Satan.  And that, my friends, is the book on Barack Obama.  Where we go one, we go all. ",
