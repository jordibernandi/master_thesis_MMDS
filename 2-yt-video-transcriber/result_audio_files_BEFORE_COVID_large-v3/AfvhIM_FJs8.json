            "text": "Hello?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, can you hear me?  Can I help you?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello, Nolan, is that you, Nolan?  Yeah, are you home?  No, I'm not home.  What can I help you with, Nolan?  So we have a court order.  I need to come and look at the premise.  Well, I'm not home, but can you leave a copy of that court order in the mailbox for me?  Are your kids home?  No one's home.  Okay, so when we got here, we saw kids in the home through the window.  Is Mike home?  Yeah, you saw kids through the home.  Through the window?  Oh, did you get a picture of that?  No, I didn't.  Oh, well, then I don't know who else to be in the home.  They're not there.  Hey, sir, this is Officer Brantley with the Plano Police Department.  When will you be home?  Why is that relevant, sir?  Did you say why you guys are at my house?  Have a cooler to look at the house.  That's what I'm saying.  Can you leave a copy of that?  I'm not saying you can't come by, but we can schedule a time for you to come by and look at my house when I'm home.  That's the thing.  When will you be home?  I'll tell you what.  You can leave the court order there, and I can contact my attorney, and we can go from there.  Am I under any charges?  Am I under arrest?  Is there a warrant out for my arrest?  No.  And so the court order doesn't say we have to work with your schedule.  I'm sorry, say that again?  The court order does not talk about us having to work with your schedule on it, sir.  Then, well, I'm not saying what the court order says.  I'm just, all I ask is that this be the court order in the mailbox so I can actually see the court order.  and validate him with an attorney.  before I go, you know, just pop up at my house.  Are you going to be home tomorrow?  We understand that.  Okay.  Are you going to be home tomorrow?  Yeah, yeah, I'll be home tomorrow.  What time will you come by?  Okay.  All right, tomorrow about 5.30.  Can we do around?  Can you do it a little earlier?  Can you come a little earlier?  Can you come a little earlier?  Uh, 2 o'clock?  2 o'clock?  Um... How's like 4?  How's like 4 o'clock?  Actually, can we do them early in the morning?  Maybe 10 o'clock?  Does 10 o'clock work for you?  No, we work.  Can we do like 4?  How long will it take?  30 seconds.  30 seconds.  And what is it that, does the order actually state what it is that you're actually looking at?  Well, you know what, don't worry about it.  Just leave the order.  I'll check that out for y'all.  430 works.  Go ahead and speak to your attorney, and then we'll speak to our program director, and we'll call you tomorrow to schedule a time.  Okay.  Is there a reason why you guys didn't call me today?  Well, typically when we do OTI, when we have a court order, we just show up.  Oh, okay.  Well, you see I have the little ring thing.  Yeah, I know you do.  Okay.  That didn't bother me.  No, I'm not trying to say it bothers you or anything like that.  I'm just saying, like, I mean, it would have just been better if we could have scheduled it.  I could have been there.  I understand that, but there was somebody home when I drove up.  So we'll get with your attorney, and then Nolan will give you a call tomorrow and we'll ring the time.  Okay, sure.  And by the way, I never said that I know everything about the law.  Okay.  You have a good day.  You too.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, man.  How was that? ",
