Bionic Dances YouTube channel.  Greetings fellow space travelers, Bionic Dance here.  One thing I've been noticing is that theists often have difficulty conceiving of a life, of a worldview, that isn't at least structured like a religion, and impose that expectation on atheism.  But while non-belief in a deity may come with implications, atheism isn't a dogma.  It isn't like religion.  So trying to claim that atheism comes with presuppositions is at least ignorant.  in the most literal, least judgmental sense of the term, if not outright chowder-headed, in the most judgmental sense of that word.  Belief and non-belief aren't parallels, and you can't treat them as though they are. ",

If that's not the case... uh then you have a chaotic universe in which you have to impose meaning upon and your body has to be a neutral entity that you impose meaning upon which means you can do whatever you want with it and you can do whatever you want with the uh created world because it's yours.  there's no um everything becomes contractual right which is where social contract comes from and those things It's not.
