            "text": "So let's talk about Charlize Theron, which is not normally a subject I would discuss, but there is something about the, and I guess we could call them the gender politics of her love life combined with her career that makes this worth talking about.  Now, I know you're probably thinking, okay, what a worthless thing to discuss, but hear me out.  It's a lot more interesting than you think.  So this is an article from March, I think it was March 12th, 2018.  Charlize Theron, April 12th, sorry.  Charlize Theron on having kids her way.  She grew up during apartheid South Africa and fought her way to Hollywood greatness.  Now she squares off with her biggest challenge yet, parenthood, both offscreen and on.  Because she's doing this interview during the press tour of a film called Tully.  I've never seen it.  Never even heard of it, actually.  And it's a movie about mothers, so I guess it wasn't marketed to me.  But this is just... The interview here was really interesting.  She goes through a bunch of stuff, like having to put on weight for the role, stuff like this.  And then you get to when she starts talking about her adoption.  The interviewer asks her, is there a part of you that feels like you're missing out on something by not having your own biological kids?  And she says no.  Gives an anecdote from when she was a kid of having... written a story about an orphanage or something.  And she says, I never saw a difference in raising an adopted child versus my own biological child.  I don't feel like I'm missing out on something.  It was always my first choice, even when I was in a relationship.  I was very honest with my partners that I was open to having my own biological kids, but that adoption had to be part of my life.  I felt strongly about it.  So the next question is, and what have you learned about yourself as a parent?  And she says, perspective.  I just see things clearer.  A child in my twenties was the scariest idea I could think of.  When I got to my 30s, I was so ready.  So the baby rapies kicks in, basically.  But there's a moment where you're like, oh god, I hope once I have my kids, I'm still going to want to parent this much.  I have bad days, I make mistakes, going through the tantrum stages where there's such little assholes.  And they choose the worst moments.  It's a lot for one person.  But after six years of having my two nuggets, there's not a day when I wish I hadn't done this.  And that's really nice.  And you co-parent with your mum Gerda, which is nice.  I knew that I would have to have my mum help me if I was going to do this as a single parent.  Yes, because you're not meant to be a single parent.  You're meant to be a married parent.  That's why kids from married cohabiting parents tend to be a lot more stable than others.  Just a bit of life experience that I've noticed there.  It seems that that's the normal state for humanity.  To not acknowledge her in co-parenting my children would be a lie.  It's a weird way of thinking about this, to be honest.  You would like to not acknowledge her co-parenting my children being like, yeah, okay.  I mean, I guess it would be, but like, aren't you just like, I'm really appreciative of the help she gives me.  That's how I would feel about it, I guess.  Maybe it's just me.  But she's like, yo, bitch, what about me?  Oh, sorry.  Her mother said, being a grandparent is what I was born to do.  I was like, yo, bitch, what about me?  Was it not to raise me?  I'm your kid.  Yeah, but like, kids are a nightmare.  You know that.  I'm so lucky to have that.  I'd feel pretty alone if I didn't have a partner in crime in all of this.  It should have been your husband.  But the interviewer says, what about your 20s comment?  Because it does matter when you have children, how you feel about yourself, your career, how would you describe your 20s versus 30s versus 40s?  And this is where it gets absolutely fascinating.  my 20s were everything I wanted them to be.  Now, that is an amazing statement, because I doubt there are actually many men who could turn around and say, my 20s were everything I wanted them to be.  Probably Alexander the Great could say that about his 20s.  Like, most people's 20s are not necessarily everything they want to be.  Now, that doesn't mean they're bad.  Most people have good 20s, you know, as good as they can make them.  But not, I mean, that strikes me as a kind of, A very privileged thing to say, but maybe it's the case when you're a young, attractive, famous woman.  I had a partner.  He was an adventurer.  I was an adventurer.  We would go on backpacks, go to a country for five weeks, climb mountains, stay in people's homes.  Man, I didn't have those options.  I didn't have that kind of money.  I partied.  I did it all.  We didn't have a care in the world.  Then when I ended that relationship.  I had a strong need to be a mom.  That's interesting.  It was all consuming.  I didn't need to travel or go out constantly or drink anymore.  I love the way she's a slave to her own needs here.  But I struggled mentally through the adoption process.  Some of the lowest points in my life were dealing with the first time I filed.  It really took an emotional toll.  There were many situations that didn't work out.  You get attached and have all your hopes up to get crushed.  So what she's talking about is how she would get attached to children that she had met when trying to adopt, and for whatever reason, presumably bureaucracy or whatever, the adoption didn't go through.  and then she's sort of disappointed as if she's lost a child, which must've been rough.  I had different needs.  My forties, I have never loved an age more than my forties.  Forties to me feels like Goldilocks.  I finally found the perfect size bed, the perfect size mug.  So, Goldilocks.  Everything's going great in your 40s.  You split up with a guy at the end of your 20s, you decided as a single woman you'd adopt a couple of kids, fine.  So now you're a mother, a single mother, who's relying on her mother to raise these children.  And now you're in your 40s and everything's golden and you're in the Goldilocks zone.  So how is it that you're shockingly single and why do men need to grow a pet and step up?  Just out of interest.  I'm not really following the everything's going great for me part here.  If you seem to be demanding a boyfriend as if you are entitled to one.  And that's the thing that amazes me the most.  I mean, I guess that, you know, when you're in your 20s and you're a young, beautiful, attractive woman, everything's going great for you, you're very successful.  Maybe it just feels like you're entitled to these things.  But when you hit 40s and you're not those things anymore... Why is it?  you feel that you're still entitled to them?  It's an interesting question, isn't it?  But anyway, Charlize thinks men need to step up.  This is so great.  Get in line.  What?  Get in line?  line i mean.  she says she's been single for 10 years for some reason which isn't true as they tell us that at some point in one of the other articles that she was dating another guy in 2015. not like.  i don't follow any of this i don't even know who these people are really but like okay so okay so she's been single for five years really but yeah so get in line.  that's interesting.  do i need to take a ticket?  So she's opened up about a dating life or that lack thereof and implored those who are interested to make a move.  This is really interesting.  She has literally fallen on the press.  She's so privileged.  She goes to the press and goes, look, I just really want to date.  You know, I've been single for like 10 years.  It's been terrible.  I just need to get some.  I just need to get a man.  I just need to... Just need some.  And you, the press, are going to report this.  I mean, this has been unbelievably widely reported as well.  This has been in dozens and dozens of outlets.  And I'm just like, who are you advertising to?  But it's so strange.  It's like the entitlement.  Somebody just needs to grow a pair and step up.  Okay, beta orbiters, now is your time to shine.  If you went bald in your 20s and you're a successful programmer, now is your time to step up.  I'm shockingly available.  God, how entitled is that?  But what I love about this is Seth Rogen's response.  She's out there, and she replied, I've made it very clear, like he's being held hostage.  She's got a gun, right?  So someone has got to do their civic duty as a man and step up and defuse this bomb.  Basically, ladies, what I'm saying in this video is that don't waste your 20s.  Your 20s are an investment for you because that is when you are at your most powerful.  You, as a woman, are socially powerful at that point.  You have a lot of influence.  If you're an attractive woman, you have unbelievable amounts of influence if you want it.  Men don't tend to have very much influence when they're young.  That tends to grow with age.  With women, it seems to dissipate.  So your 20s are an investment into a future that you're meant to be planning for.  And Charlize Theron didn't do that.  She ended that relationship before she actually had the kids with the guy she was supposed to have kids with.  She'd spent like 10 years with this guy, she split up with him, then it's all gone downhill from there.  Even though her fame and fortune is presumably at zenith.  It doesn't matter.  She's not happy.  And she's fucking annoyed.  You can tell the stress in the way she's saying, you know, someone needs to just step up and marry me.  And these two adopted kids I have.  I wasn't even in a relationship when I adopted them.  I just thought it'd be a good idea.  You have to be aware that men have standards, frankly.  And even Charlize Theron can fall below them if she makes the wrong moves.  Now, it's nothing to do with her looks, obviously.  Any man with a 43-year-old wife who looked like that would be very happy.  Like, that would be amazing.  But that's just not good enough, you know?  There are other considerations that you have to really think about.  Basically what I'm saying is Charlize Theron is not very attractive to men as a relationship prospect at this point.  But on paper, and according to say, I don't know, feminist theory, Charlize Theron has won.  You know, she's unbelievably successful, she's good looking, gorgeous obviously.  She's famous.  She's, you know, multimillionaire.  She is the one who's done it.  She's got a family, but she doesn't have a man and she's not happy.  You know, she doesn't come across.  I read a bunch of these interviews.  She doesn't come across as a happy person.  She comes across as a person who's kind of fucked up her life.  Even though on paper from like a feminist metric, she's unbelievably successful.  You know, she should be thrilled by the sort of the worldview about women that the left has been pushing for the last 30 years.  She's actually got it all except for the sort of core component in her life, which is a solid relationship.  Don't be like Charlize.  You know, your 20s are an investment.  Use her as a guide.  This is a warning.  I mean, you probably aren't as good looking as her.  You probably aren't as successful as she is.  You're probably not going to succeed on her level.  And even she has come to this point where she's just saying, well, man, someone's got to step up and date me.  I mean, do you want to be that?  Do you want to be that woman with two kids that she needs her mother to help raise?  Like, that's not success.  She's not happy with what she's got, and it shows.  Don't be like this. ",
