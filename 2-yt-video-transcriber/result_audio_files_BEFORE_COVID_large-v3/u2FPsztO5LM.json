            "text": "Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is left to reflect on Labour's worst election performance since 1935.  He's going to be standing down as leader in the new year, but with so many young members who joined the party to support Jeremy Corbyn specifically, how does Labour find an elected leader who can re-establish Labour as potential leaders.  We're joining us from Westminster now to contribute to this.  We've got the contributing editor at Novara Media, Ash Sarkar, and John Rental, chief political commentator for The Independent.  Good afternoon to you both.  Interesting times for the Labour Party.  The dust has settled a little bit.  Ash, I'll come to you first.  So many people asking over the weekend after that result on Friday, what went wrong?  Have you managed to crystallise it this Monday afternoon? ",

            "text": "Well, I think that if you look at the results, you can tell that a few things happened.  One is that Jeremy Corbyn did not enjoy the same bounce that he did in 2017.  And so those negative favorability ratings really dogged him throughout the campaign.  The second thing is that Brexit, obviously, it split his electoral coalition.  It meant that votes were being lost to the Liberals and the Greens in places which could have turned seats, for example, Chingford and Woodford Green.  But then also in those Northern and Midlands seats, the fact that the Brexit party was running against Labour candidates meant that Labour leavers either went to the brexit party or because labor had shifted their position towards the second referendum didn't seem to be as committed to respecting the referendum result as they did in 2017. they lost a huge chunk of their votes there.  and then the third thing is if you look at the breakdown of age groups And where they turned out is that Labour absolutely dominated everyone aged 18 to 45.  The Tories dominated from 45 upwards.  And the problem with Labour's young vote is that it's solid.  It is pretty much unchallenged.  But young people tend to be concentrated around metropolitan areas.  So you really get punished by the geographic spread.  You know, so Corbyn got 3% more of the vote share than Ed Miliband did, but overall 30 less seats than Ed Miliband did.  So punishing. ",

And, you know, that was different from 2017.  I mean, he surprised everyone, I think, including himself, in 2017 by coming across as reasonable and measured.  rather contrary to the way he was portrayed in the media.  But I think in the two and a half years since, I think people realised what Jeremy Corbyn really is, which is some kind of SWP front in charge of the Labour Party, and they didn't like it one little bit.  And that was the fundamental reason, I think, why Labour lost. ",

Because it's interesting, isn't it?  Do you get somebody in Jeremy Corbyn's vein?  Because so many members rushed to join the party, so many young members, as you pointed out, because of Jeremy Corbyn specifically.  Or do they go to somebody else who has broader appeal? ",

And 2017 really was the anomaly there.  What I would say is that the policies, particularly renationalizing railways, even free fiber optic broadband, polled very, very well.  But there wasn't a political strategy which turned this manifesto into a compelling story the same way that there was in 2017.  So I would be very cautious about throwing the baby out with the bathwater and saying that what we need is a return to, you know, centrist, neoliberal politics.  If that were the case, then the Liberal Democrats would have returned far more than 11 MPs and Change UK would have gotten more than what?  I think it was somewhere between 0% and 1% of the vote. ",

Voters didn't buy in to the plan.  They might have liked the idea of renationalising the railway, boosting the NHS, giving it lots of money, but they didn't quite believe the path to get to those points.

And, you know, nationalising the railways is just... I mean, I'm sorry, it's just not important enough.  It doesn't matter.  It's irrelevant.  I mean, it's a silly policy because the railways are essentially nationalised anyway.  But you can't win elections on nationalising railways.

I mean, she's actually a much more mainstream left-wing politician.

I doubt, for instance, that Owen Smith would have done much better in this general election than Jeremy Corbyn did because he would have, if anything, hemorrhaged even more votes.  in those Labour Leave seats.  Whoever the next leader of the Labour Party is, and I for one actually do really like Becky Long-Bailey, is that they need to be able to bridge the gap between Labour's metropolitan centres, where lots of BAME working-class people are, where much of their young vote is, and speak to those older voters, home-owning voters, in de-industrialised towns.  That is Labour's electoral coalition, and I think, weirdly, They should be looking to parties like the SNP who've managed to hold together similar electoral coalitions.  Simply going back to the failed politics of yesterday, the discredited ideologies of the past, is no way to meet the challenges of the future. ",

I was in the north-east, Blythe Valley.  Nobody expected that huge 10% swing.  And those who turned from red to blue on that election night, I spoke to some of them in Blythe Valley, and I said, are you simply loaning your vote for Brexit?  And they said, no, it's about much more than that.  We're genuinely going to give the Conservatives a try.  They've got five years to win our trust.

So all those arguments about leave and remain won't matter.  And I think the other argument that shouldn't matter is whether Labour is trying to get back working class votes or middle class votes.  I mean, I think one of the problems with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership is that he's turned the Labour Party into an entirely middle class giveaway party that wants to subsidise student fees, wants to subsidise the railways, all to the benefit, essentially, of the middle class, and has left the working class behind.  But, I mean, Labour cannot afford to focus just on the working class.  It has to be the party for everyone.  And that was one of Tony Blair's worst soundbites, that the Labour Party is the political arm of none other than the entire British people.

And so far, the Conservative Party have not offered any credible answers to addressing this single most important issue facing all of humanity.  And neither has many of the centrist heroes that I know that John is very, very keen on.  So unless we can actually knuckle down, make the case for substantive action on climate change and quickly build a social majority behind it, all of these conversations about who would be a very good leader are ultimately moot as we don't have a sustainable future on this planet anymore.
