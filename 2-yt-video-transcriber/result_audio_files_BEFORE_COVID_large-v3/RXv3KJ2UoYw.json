Hello, everybody.  My name is Aurelia Rita Marcelles from Africa Web TV.  Welcome to another edition of Afropean Safaris.  And today we are in this lovely country called Macedonia.  So join us in this journey.  We're going to have several trips around Macedonia and let's see how it goes.  Come, let's go.  My name is Albana and I'm actually from Hamburg.  I came here for holiday because my family lives here.  I think we spend a lot of time here and it's like our second home.  I really want the cherries.  I don't like the sugar.  here in the Orchid Lake, if I said it correctly, Orchid.  And right now we have just decided to take a spontaneous boat trip.  What we really realized about this place, it reminded us so much about Forozani, Forozani and Zanzibar at the harbor.  So yeah, it's such an amazing place.  It's so beautiful and I can't wait for you to see it. ",

            "text": "Right now we are doing the trip in the oldest lake in Europe, which is approximately 2 million years old.  It belongs to the same group of various lakes like Tanganyika, Victoria and Baica lakes.  Practically right now we are going to this place and here we call it Lovino.  Labino, it's a natural place.  Antique theater, which is built 200 years before the Christ, and also the Romans, they were using for gladiator fights.  Right now, we use for normal purposes.  The most traditional festival in the country, starting every year from 12th of July to 20th of August.  Every day, different program, classical music, drama, ballet, opera, like Jose Carreras was in here, Ennio Morricone, Zucchero, and many, many other eminent names from the cultural world.  What I like to mention, I didn't mention before, but old name of the town is Lichnidos, which means city of light.  We got a lot of sunny days through the year.  That's how the name became out.  after that he was not a king.  he was tsar samuel who built the fort on the top at 10th century and when he was looking for location to build it he said two words.  oh the meaning is oh it's when you get excited.  oh something beautiful reed.  it's a small hill.  oh what a beautiful hill.  oh reed became in one.  that's how the legend said asante sana to all of you.

            "text": "This is what we call the movie.  I did that by myself and there was a chicken behind me just cutting me.  For a moment it looks like Agadir, but not exactly the same, but this angle of the fortress and the sea.  Don't talk to me now.  She will be super nice.  She will be happy.  So, right now I'm about to paraglide.  I've never done this before in my life.  And honestly, I'm scared.  I don't want to see what I'm dealing with.  But then I feel like I need to do this.  So, yeah.  Just join me and see.  But I'm very nervous.  And I want to... go to the bushes somewhere and just like empty my bowels.  yeah come let's go.  you see the hill over there.  i just paraglided 1800 feet of the ground i don't know but that was the scare most scary thing i've ever done.  I don't know.  It's magical.  You have that quick adrenaline right before you leave, but it's a microsecond.  It's calm.  It's still.  It's slow.  It's refreshing.  You can breathe.  My colleague was also taking the the parachute and all I could see was them going like and I told the pilot, please don't be adventurous and not with me.  But they thought I was being adventurous.  They thought I was having like a lot of, you know, like 15 times.  and yeah it's slow but it's fun.  now listen my name is aurelia rita matalas.  i'm black as they come and i just did.  black people do not do okay.  sorry excuse my french no my swahili.  would i recommend it to africans or africans because we normally have this Weird fear of things.  Yeah.  That's the best, like, I don't know, like, oh, that's the best thing I've done so far in my life.  Like, it's the best.  Good morning.  Hello, good morning.  It's another day in Macedonia and today we're going to a very historic place and it's called St.  Naum.  I'm curious to know what is, what does it look like?  There are churches there because there are churches for a day here.  So yeah, come with me.  Let's see.  Ready to cruise.  So we're now in a museum on water, and they have replicated this place to show how people used to live in the past, like in the Bronze and the Iron Age.  I suspect they're using reeds and cow dung and all that stuff.  Come, let's go.  Ooh, they even have pods.  it's so cool.  you know what most people don't know that the grass is actually really cool has a cooling effect than the normal iron sheet but then people will tell you because you live like this you're poor and i think it's strategic.  If I can live in a house that cools itself down, I mean, why not?  It doesn't keep heat, so you don't feel the heat when it's cold.  But I don't know how it works when it's very cold.  I cannot speak on winter.  I can only speak on summertime.  So now I'm entering the church.  You're not allowed to bring cameras in, but I'll just give you the experience if possible.  This must have taken them so much time.  Right here?  Yeah.  Oh.  Thank you.  It looks very serene.  I wish we could get to kayak or to one of the boats just to go a bit inside and see how the river looks like.  but so far so good.  This is very beautiful.  I like that.  there's a bit also of commercial activities going on because there are restaurants in the same place.  You can get kayaks, people selling maize, water in the streets.  So yeah.  This has been a very serene experience.  Mother Teresa was born here in Skopje on 26 May 1910, and her name was Gonca Agnes Boyaji.  Gonca is actually a Turkish name, means small rose.  Over here we have a model of Tarkaus.  Tarkaus was located on the main square but it was destroyed in the earthquake.  We are in the memorial house of Mother Teresa because she came originally from Macedonia but she's of Albanian origin and I'm just seeing her noble prize from 1979.  What kind of sound is that?  We've come to the end of the amazing trip in Macedonia or how the locals call it, Macedonia.  I will give you a recap of how the trip has been.  We've gone to several cities, several villages and seen a lot of picturesque beautiful, beautiful places.  One of the places that we went to was the city of Struga.  And the people of Struga are just amazing.  There's a river flowing through it.  Kids are jumping in the streets.  They're jumping into the water and just having fun.  Very friendly people, the people of Macedonia.  And you get a mix of of the Macedonians and Albanians and other minorities, but everybody is curious to know who are you, where are you from and how you feel, if you feel at home in the country or not.  One thing about Africans, they work hard.  yeah yeah okay that's good you know.  where did you learn that?  uh in youtube.  yeah that was just amazing.  then we got to the city of awkward and awkward is surrounded with the awkward lake and basically the awkward lake is home away from home because you get to really eat the fish which is amazing.  the food here.  if you're a meat lover like me that is the place to be because the meat is life.  and if you are someone who is adventurous you like to paraglide.  guys please do it here.  please do it here.  it is magical because when you're over the hills you get to see the the the lake and everything that is surrounding it.  the villages and the people are very nice the the pilots very professional.  i will definitely recommend that.  something else i would love to recommend to you is make sure that you go to the river matka.  it is Picture us, the serenity is just off the roof.  You get to just relax into yourself, look at the canyon.  And what we did not get to do, that maybe next time we will do, was just to go through the canyon just to enjoy the place.  You can kayak here, which is something I tried.  And other things that the place has to offer is boat rides at a very affordable price.  My name is Aurelia Rita Marcellus from Africa Web TV.
