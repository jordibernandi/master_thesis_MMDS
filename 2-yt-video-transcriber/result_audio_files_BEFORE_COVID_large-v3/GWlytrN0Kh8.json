            "text": "But his real claim to fame as an economist came in the immediate aftermath of the First World War.  In 1920, he published an article called Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth.  You have to appreciate the historical setting.  During the midst of the First World War, there has occurred the Bolshevik or the communist revolution in Russia.  There is set in motion a three-year civil war in Russia in which Lenin and his Bolsheviks are fighting the anti-communist or white armies, at the end of which the communists are triumphant.  And shortly after that, the country is consolidated and renamed the Soviet Union.  But in that midst of the immediate years after the war, there was this idea that the future has arrived.  It's the end of capitalism.  There will now be the institution and the practice of a socialist planned economy.  Now, what is a socialist plan economy?  Traditionally, it has meant the nationalization of the means of production, no more private ownership of land, factories, tools, machinery.  And the state, therefore, if it nationalizes, it becomes the single employer of all working in the society.  and that the socialist promise that by ending the self-interested profit motive and to produce not for profit but for need or the necessities of people in society, there would be a far greater prosperity and equality in the society.  And Mises asked, a mundane but very important question.  Okay, Mr.  Planner, you've now nationalized the means of production.  There's no more markets.  There's no more competition.  There's no more prices.  How do you know what to do? ",

            "text": "Mises points out that The socialists of his day, that is 1920, hadn't really thought about the problem of how to choose methods of production.  All the means of production are socially owned.  Then you don't have competition among different entrepreneurs who have different ideas about how to use inputs, how to use oil, gasoline, hired labor, concrete to produce things.  then you don't get the most efficient output.  You can't rely on that kind of process to tell you when you're wasting resources because there isn't any profit and loss test anymore.  So that's his great contribution to the\u2014 initiates the socialist calculation debate. ",

            "text": "An avalanche of criticisms came down upon him.  He responded to his critics.  The critics had to respond to his Rapporteur, with the consequence that by the 1930s, the socialists are having to admit he's right.  You have to have some value common denominator to know what everything is worth to make any rational decisions.  So then in the 1930s, you have a Polish economist named Oskar Lange who tries to make this idea, well, we'll play at markets and have market socialism.  We'll have the government set prices, and then government factory managers will use the prices to try to make rational calculations and decisions, and the government will sort of adjust prices if needed.  Mises' response to that is, they're either real prices representing what people really think, who are making their own consumption choices, investing their own money, or they're just play prices that have no real value and meaning or adaptability to change like occurs every day in the market.  So that by the 1930s and 40s, Mises and then his younger friend and colleague Hayek, who developed his own variations on this same theme against central planning, had become the most prominent voices against the hope and the ideal of a socialist economy.  So the end result that Mises reaches, which is part of also his claim to fame and drives some people crazy, is that he says socialism can't work.  interventionism in government regulation, contrary to purpose, because they just gum up the works.  So at the end of the day, there is only one institutional economic system that has functioning capability, and that is basically an unhampered, unregulated free market economy, in which the role of the government is not to intrude, redistribute, control, but to serve those basic functions of protection of everyone's life, liberty, and honestly acquired property in a setting of voluntary trade and exchange.  So all that one does is done in a way to improve the circumstances of others, as Adam Smith long ago argued through his idea of the invisible hand. ",
