            "text": "All right.  Just got out of the car.  I don't know what's over here, but on the maps, it looked like there might've been some cool stuff.  I'm on NASA and La Florista drive and Brea.  I do know there's some unmarked stuff back here.  Oh, walking trail.  That's cool.  Um, which might be like Bank of America corporate or something.  always kind of am impressed at some of these older buildings that are in Brea how they kind of look like uh i don't know like bomb shelters from the 80s or something.  i don't know what that is over there but yeah there's that bomb shelter.  look i was talking about.  You know what it reminds me of is some of the malls they built in the very late 70s.  Like, let's see, well, Westminster Mall.  That's the big one that comes out in my head.  Had a looks just like this parking lot across the street.  The ground slopes upward towards the middle.  Parts of it around in parts of it come to sharp corners.  It's kind of like they didn't know what era they wanted to be.  And he threw in a little bit of everything.  And I kind of like that, like the confetti styling.  All right.  Sorry if I'm a little out of breath.  I always do this.  I park somewhere far away.  I walk a mile or so.  Turn on the camera.  All right.  This is what?  This is Suzuki.  That's a kind of cool tree over there.  Issues.  Oh, hey, security guard over there.  Look at that Segway.  Dude, it looks like a vehicle.  Wow.  those things are pretty cool all right i think the person in the segway just happened to be going by.  i don't think they even know i'm here yet.  hopefully they'll just continue to go by.  that's kind of cool eerie street light all by itself making sure the gate's locked steps that go up with no sign saying you can't go up.  oh it's over here.  it's a hike.  So what is this?  Looks like there's a loading dock down there.  that might look kinda cool.  I'm not sure.  These trees are cool.  What are you doing?  Hey!  Why are you so scared of a camera?  Why do you want to stop me?  I'm not stopping you.  You stopped.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  You're not supposed to be there.  This is sidewalk.  This is a public walkway.  What are you doing here?  Don't snap me.  Don't.  Don't do what?  Do you want to snap me or what?  Snap you?  Uh-huh.  What does snap you mean?  Do you want to capture me?  Capture you like a Pokemon or something?  No.  I don't know.  Why are you putting the camera on my face?  I'm not putting it in your face.  I'm at least 15 feet from you and you're the one that stopped.  You're pissing me.  Who cares?  You're not supposed to be here.  Says who?  Says my boss.  I don't care what your boss says.  What's the law say?  Do you want me to call my boss?  I don't care.  Fly away.  And she flew away at top speed.  You are not supposed to be here.  There's a freaking... Okay guys, this right here, right here is a walking trail called the Brea Tracks.  The other side of the public street from that side.  Both sides are in egress.  I'm walking on a walking trail right now, but I'm not supposed to be here.  Right?  I guess people can't be on the public roads in Brea.  Sorry guys, this is not China.  I can do it.  And I will do it.  And I will snap you.  And I will capture you.  Oh cool, look at these cog wheel things.  Let's see with the light on.  Come this way.  If you want to be left alone, stay away.  You're going to come after me.  I'm going to take your picture.  I'm going to call my boss right now.  What are you doing here?  I got different codes.  I'm just going to back up this way.  How's it going?  Hey.  What's up?  Are you just filming?  Pretty much.  Okay.  As long as you stay off bank property.  I haven't been on it.  Okay.  No problem.  Okay.  you might want to educate her because she was telling me i'm not allowed to be on the sidewalk.  no no the sidewalk is fine.  well she doesn't seem to think that okay and you also.  she might be a liability.  anytime anyone raises the camera she covers her face and she's pretty much worthless when she does that.  i'm sorry.  what did she do?  anytime i raise the camera she covers her face like this.  so she's if i wanted to do something i would just raise the camera and she'd be done with.  She's kind of worthless as a security guard when you cover your face.  You might want to train her.  Well, she's covering her face because she doesn't want you to take a picture of her.  Is that what you mean?  I don't know the logic, but whenever I raise my camera, she covers her face.  Yeah, she doesn't want to be on film.  Well, she should stay home.  How many cameras do you guys have?  Our cameras.  Yeah.  That's no difference.  It's much different.  I don't know who she is.  I don't get your point, but... My point is, if she's supposed to protect anything, she should be... No, she's covering her face because you're filming her.  If somebody wanted to... Let me break it down to a third level.  Let me break it down to a lower level so you can understand.  If I wanted to do something to her, I would just raise my camera and run at her.  She wouldn't even see me for 10 seconds because she goes like this for like 10 seconds.  So I'm saying you might want to teach her to open her hands or something.  I mean, if you're a security guard and your eye is kind of like your main... You want to see what's going on, right?  Okay, I don't know.  Maybe we're two trips crossing each other.  I don't know.  Okay.  I can defeat her by raising my camera, is what I'm saying.  At that point, she's worthless.  That's probably not what you want.  I'm guessing.  Okay.  Unless that's what you train for.  People to cover up and cowl when someone raises a camera.  Okay.  I'm just, just logic, right?  I don't, it's your logic, but that's okay.  Okay.  You can be defeated by a camera.  That's not really too great, is it?  Yeah, okay.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, why don't you stay off main property?  We're all good.  Okay.  Thank you very much. ",
