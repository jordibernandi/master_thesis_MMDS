            "text": "Yeah, I'm not convinced that God exists.  That doesn't mean I'm convinced that God doesn't exist.  To me, it's an unfalsifiable proposition that has never presented sufficient evidence to believe it.  So it's like asking me, do you think the Loch Ness Monster doesn't exist?  Well, the position is I'm not convinced it does exist because sufficient evidence hasn't been presented.  I may also be convinced that it doesn't exist if there's evidence against it.  So any religious God model that includes, for example, the notion of a soul?  I think that those are demonstrably false because what we know about a soul or what is attributed to a soul are all identifiable and malleable functions of a brain.  We can, through brain trauma, we can completely change somebody's personality.  We can change their memories.  There's a great study V.S.  Ramachandran did where somebody severed the corpus callosum.  I think they do it for epileptic grandma seizures, but basically you end up with your brain split in half and when that happens, and in this particular case that he was studying, you end up with two distinct personalities, two individuals who can communicate independently.  One of them will have access to the vocal cords and can speak and the other one has to write.  And what's interesting is not only did it result in two independent personalities in one single brain, which doesn't make sense if there's a ghost in the machine, But also one of them was a believer in God and one of them was an atheist.  And so the question then, you know, there's a lot of other things, the math with souls, when you have like a fertilized egg splitting and rejoining and all this other stuff.  There's a couple of really good books on the subject.  I wish I could remember one of them off the top of my head, but I can't.  But I think the soul is the single most clearly, obviously dead concept in all of theology.  And any God and religion that is contingent upon a soul, something to save, I think those are, you know, I'm not asserting absolute certainty about anything, but I'm convinced that those are false.
