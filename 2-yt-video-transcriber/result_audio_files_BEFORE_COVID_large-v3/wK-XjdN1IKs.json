            "text": "There was a notice, I saw it on Snapchat, there is going to be a big walkout of people who are upset about this discussion tonight.  We have it, yes.  Hey everyone, I'm hoping to get some support in opposition to an anti-trans event.  I guess that's us, apparently we're an anti-trans event, who knew?  Tonight, it's happening at UMKC.  There's a plan in place to stage a silent walkout shortly after the events start and to attend a different event.  If you are free Thursday, please consider coming.  The plan is as follows.  We recommend using an alias and registering as many guests as possible for the event.  If you can't attend, it helps if you register an alias anyway.  Then you can attend the event, try to be early, disperse throughout the crowd, be as disruptive as possible, and then at the sound of the phone alarm, stand up and walk out silently.  Silently.  This will be within five to ten minutes of the talk starting.  Please remain silent during the walkout.  Not doing so places trans students and other participants at risk.  I know you're so oppressed, my dears.  I know life is so hard for you.  You have to live in the richest, most equitable, most just country in the history of the world.  You have to get a college education.  You have to voluntarily go to lectures.  It's so awful.  I can't imagine.  You know, the people, people who are in war toward nations, they must truly, they must truly pity you.  Goodbye.  Goodbye then.  I'm not that, thank you gentlemen, I appreciate your support, but I'm not that intimidated by these guys.  Well, it's very difficult to use my platform when people use the heckler's veto to try to shut up any opinion that disagrees.  I didn't think I was this intimidated.  I believe that gentleman just threw paint on me.  I don't know what the substance is.  I'm fine.  I don't know what this is.  I think someone threw milk on me or something.  I don't really know.  You're just trying to teach me with your fists.  Thank you.  That's the same lesson that Mussolini was teaching people.  You ridiculous fascists.  You ridiculous, silly fascists. ",
