            "text": "Alright everyone, talk about a coincidence.  I was making a video about Epstein and how the unsealing of older court documents the other day was significant politically, potentially for the left in the country.  Then all of a sudden my DMs on Twitter are blowing up and it's being reported by the New York Post, and I corroborated this, it's being reported everywhere.  Epstein's dead.  He killed himself.  Epstein dead of suicide.  Yeah, I totally believe that.  Don't worry, YouTube.  I'm not making dangerous conspiracy theories here.  I totally believe that the dude who already tried to kill himself before was just not watched enough.  He wasn't under guard enough and managed to off himself this time.  It's normal.  It happens all the time in prisons that people who are already judged a suicide risk, according to official reporting, are allowed to try again.  It's normal, totally normal.  It's totally normal that it happens less than 24 hours after the unsealing of old court documents showing, hey, some of the people that were initially blamed for having taken advantage of children on Rape Island.  Bill Richardson, former Democratic governor of New Mexico, a sitting Democratic senator from, I think, Alabama, if I remember correctly.  Prince Andrew and a bunch of other bigwigs and people who all have a connection to the Clinton family.  And then this happens.  Who killed him?  Vince Foster's ghost?  You know, he killed himself.  Yeah, he got possessed by Vince Foster.  Oh, just trust me, dude.  Just off yourself before they get a chance to do it themselves.  It'll be way worse.  You'll shoot yourself three times in the back.  Did he hang himself twice from 10 feet away?  What mysterious weird things are going to be part of this case, I wonder?  Yeah, totally rational, everyone.  There's nothing to see here.  I'm getting really tired.  Let's go home.  Fuck you.  Come on, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?  Yeah, this is totally normal, guys.  This prison, are you going to investigate the prison for their practices with relation to people who are a suicide risk then?  You've got someone who supposedly, he wasn't beaten up, he wasn't attacked, he wasn't jumped, the guards didn't look the other way while Bubba got into his cell and beat him to a bloody pulp with a baseball bat.  No, no, no, he tried to kill himself before they found him half-conscious in a fetal position.  You're telling me that a few weeks later he somehow had access to the means to actually kill himself, despite already having tried and almost succeeded, supposedly, according to the prison?  What guards were responsible for his well-being at the time?  Some little dude is going to take the fall and say, yeah, yeah, I mean, I took too long on my break.  I'm sorry.  I was two extra minutes at the snack vendor or something.  Yeah, and he killed himself in the meantime.  What a fucking goddamn coincidence.  Seems to happen a lot with people who are, you know, connected to a lot of political individuals and might squeal at any given time.  Can you say somebody thought that he was getting a little bit nervous in his cell and decided to execute a red alert sort of order?  You gotta be fucking crazy if you actually believe the official story here.  Not saying whodunit, I'm not spreading any conspiracy theories, but yeah, I think it might be a little bit odd here.  Right as I'm reporting on this other story, I might as well wrap that into the same fucking ship.  The Epstein filings there couldn't be worse for the left.  It couldn't be worse for the Democrats.  Bill Richardson, he ran for the presidency.  And people took him seriously, too, back in 2008.  Even Dorst Obama.  He was a long-term Clinton friend.  He, as far as I know, still is a Clintonian neoliberal.  The sitting senator from, again, so you've got another prominent Democrat on the hashtag MeToo list.  The problem is you're in the middle of a fiery election right now, and these people are tripping all over themselves with regards to the case.  It doesn't even matter if the initial claims by Virginia, I think it's Guifrey or Guifer, I can't pronounce her last name, my apologies.  She's claiming that she was pimped out to these individuals sent to Bill Richardson's room and Prince Andrew and stuff.  The perception is not going to be good for the political establishment.  Because people are going to believe her even if the claims are false, because these are like 10-year-old claims that are being unsealed now, pertinent to a new investigation.  Now the dude at the center of it fucking killed himself.  Supposedly.  He killed himself.  Yeah.  I totally believe that claim.  Cut this short to get it on there.  But yeah, I was literally in the middle of making another video on the fucking same subject, and it starts coming through from every goddamn person in the world.  Oh yeah, Epstein just killed himself.  Vince Foster just killed himself, dude.  Yeah, people do that all the fucking time who have high political connections.  It happens constantly.  I mean, they shoot themselves in the back of the head, they hang themselves in the prison cell, they just try to go swimming in an alligator-infested swimming pool.  It happens constantly.  These people have something wrong with them, in the most literal sense.  Come on, don't take me for a fool.  At the very least, give me credit for having self-awareness.  That's about all.  Peace out. ",
