Now, all the previous footage I saw before was very foggy, and you couldn't quite see things clearly, but this is very clear, and if anybody is falling for this, I don't understand how.  I'm going to leave a link to the full clip because it's got an interview with one of the worship leaders, I think it is, but I've just included the Glory Cloud footage in this.  So, enjoy.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh my god.  Oh god.  Yeah, you can see it.  Look.  Look.  There's so much here.  Wow.  You've got to put this on Facebook.  I said you've got to put this on Facebook.
