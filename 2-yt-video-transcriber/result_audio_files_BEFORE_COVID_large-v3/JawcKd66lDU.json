That was 17 books ago.  Olene Eagle, who many of us remember and love the memory of Olene.  And she had read the book and she interviewed me and she had me come back for some more interviews.  And I ended up inviting me to have my own program.  So I had my Grace Walk program on here for 10 years.  And that is the foundational message.  I can tell you the truth of our authentic identity and who we are in Christ is a message I've never stopped teaching and I never will stop teaching it.  But as we all know, the Bible says grow in grace.  Right.  And in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.  So over these years, like everybody else, I've grown and I'm approaching this subject now at what I believe to be a more expansive view, a wider circle.  And I'm just thrilled with what's going on in ministry and what I'm seeing happening in people's lives. ",

If you misbehave, God will punish you.  And we've got that performance mentality.  So when you switch it over from the natural realm to into the supernatural realm and you start looking at unconditional agape from God, I mean, we have to relearn, right?  We have to repent.  That is, we have to change our minds and say, wait a minute.  In terms of God's acceptance and love for me, it has nothing to do with my performance.  He doesn't love me because of how great I am.

The sad thing is that even among those of us who are professing believers, there are many who are not willing to do what you just said you had to do, and me too.  We have to always be willing to change.  People ask me sometime about grace and what I teach now about this quantum life.  They say, but where's the place for repentance?  Don't you believe in repentance?  I said, you know the word repentance.  It's the Greek word metanoia.  It means to go in opposite direction.  It means what you've just said, to be open to change, to grow.  We live a life of repentance.  I was here 17 years ago.  I can tell you, and I'm thankful to say it, I'm not the same person I was 17 years ago.  And I hope not to be the same person 17 years from now or even 17 weeks from now.  Because this is a continuum where we're growing and we're getting stronger.  The way I say it is, back when I was here before and I taught Grace Walk.  So let's start at the smallest circle.  I grew up in an evangelical church world where my knowledge of God and the love that revealed to me through Christ looked like this.  I don't mean it was small, but it was the center circle.  And then I began to understand identity, our identity in Christ, which is what my Grace Walk program for 10 years was all about.  Now my understanding got wider.  It didn't replace the old circle, it expanded.  Well, now, for the last six, seven years, I've been teaching what I call quantum life, which is basically a scientific approach to the kingdom of God.  And this circle is even wider.  So let me say it this way.  Early on, I learned who Christ is as a child.  I'm thankful for Christian parents.  Then, back when I was focused only on Grace Walk, I began to learn and teach who we are.  And now... With the quantum life teaching that I do, I teach how we are to live this Christ life inside this world, knowing that we're citizens of the kingdom of God.  Or if we want to use science language, to know that we're a part of a divine matrix. ",

A lot of folks watching this grew up with the language of the Bible in the church as their mother tongue.  I did.  You just said you did.  That's our primary language.  But let's face it.  We live in a postmodern world where there are a lot of people that we want to know the love of God who are never going to listen to somebody who communicates it using religious language, even using the language of the Bible.  So we have to find a way to speak the language that does in no way dilute or compromise the truth.  Not at all.  But speak the language in a way that they understand.  I tell people all the time, I go to Mexico a lot.  Grace Walk has offices in six countries.  Mexico is one of them.  When I'm in Mexico, I try to speak Spanish.  And I can speak conversational Spanish.  I don't expect them to speak English.  I speak their language.  So if we want to take this message of divine love to the world, here's my thing now.  Let's begin to learn and speak a language that they speak especially if they have an aversion to churchy-sounding talk.  Let's talk their language.  I can point people to God through Christ without having to sound like I just swallowed the communion table.  You know what I'm saying?  You don't have to talk King James to reach somebody.  And the truth is, as time progresses, culture more and more thinks we're weird.  Not peculiar people like the Bible says, but just weird people.  And Jesus attracted people.  It's odd that he repelled those we attract and he attracted those we repel.  That's got to change.  And what I'm doing with this quantum life teaching I'm doing is making an attempt to make that change and seeing good progress with it. ",

I want us to be real.  And so what I'm doing with this quantum teaching is I began studying quantum mechanics six years ago, And I thought I was seeing an overlap between that and my faith.  And I would ultimately come to see it's more than an overlap.  Quantum mechanics is an explanation of what Jesus called the kingdom of God using scientific terms.

And what I do and what I'm spending my time doing everywhere these days is showing how that when we are talking about the quantum world, what we're really talking about is the kingdom of God.  You know, I realize time is limited, so let me see if I can give you the elevator summary, okay?  I began studying quantum physics six years ago as a hobby.  My wife shakes her head and says, that's a ridiculous hobby.  But I read a few things about it that intrigued me.  So I continued to study.  And the more I studied, I began to realize that there was what I thought was an overlap between my faith, between biblical teaching, between the kingdom of God and quantum science.  And as the more I studied it, I started to see, wait a minute, science has had a conversion in the last century.  And this is the truth.  Science has had a conversion.  Quantum science, quantum mechanics is the newest understanding of science that we as a human race possess.  It began to be uncovered back in the early 20th century when people like Max Planck, who's considered the father of quantum science, began to re-examine some of the things that came out of the mouths of people like Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein and others that were scientific materialists who said, well, everything just kind of evolved out of nothing and it all just appeared and they called it upward causation.  Well, some of these early quantum scientists began to examine from a scientific standpoint that kind of materialism theory that they had held and they, lo and behold, they proved that these scientific materialists had been wrong.  And they began, listen to this, they began to show that God has to exist.  They began to show through quantum mechanics that there has to be what they call downward causation.  That there has to be a creator.  And they even begin to move into things like this creator is love.  I'll give you an example.  Einstein, who was a very reluctant convert, said the most important question a person may ask and answer is, is the universe a friendly place?  Now let me give you that in church talk.  What he was really saying is, is God good enough?  Because we know that God is ultimate reality.  Is God loving?  And Einstein concluded, yes, the universe is a friendly place.  And as they peered in deeper and deeper, these early physicists of the 20th century into the quantum world, here it is in a nutshell.  They discovered a world, a subatomic world that controls everything else.  There is a world that you can, now listen to this, and you're gonna connect the dots to your Bible.  Scientists said, wait a minute.  We have discovered there is a world that you cannot see with your eyes.  And this is a world of pure energy.  And this is a world that we now know gave rise, brought into existence, everything that you can see with your eyes.  And scientists, not preachers, not Bible teachers, scientists said in that quantum world, the rules are different.  In that quantum world, by the sheer power of belief, we would call it faith, Things can change.  In that quantum world, words have power.  Thoughts have power.  And I'm reading that and I'm thinking, wait a minute.  I've read this in my Bible.  So I thought, what would happen if we took that language, that non-religious language of the quantum science, and we began to teach that and share that with people who didn't want to hear Bible talk.  But what if we gently nudged them into the kingdom of God?  This quantum world, Jesus called it the kingdom of God.  Max Planck called it the matrix.  In fact, the movies, The Matrix, was inspired by Max Planck, the founder of quantum science.  He calls it the matrix.  Jesus called it the kingdom of God.  Paul called it in Christ.  Call it whatever you want.  It's ultimate reality.  We know that ultimate reality is not just a space.  It's a person.  But now, the old science that we grew up with in school, new scientists have said they were wrong on so much.  Let us tell you about this unseen world of pure energy today.  And I'm thinking, hey, I can talk to you and I can introduce you to the love of God with that. ",

So when he talks about God, he's not talking about God in the same sense you and I would.  But here's my argument.  The guy, these scientists, they were atheists.  And now they're moving forward and they're saying, okay, we were wrong about that.  There is this source called God.  Have they come to Christ yet?  No, but they're moving in the right direction.

We talk about the law of sowing and reaping.  Well, I can show you that from science now.  We talk about the law of love.  We talk about the power of words, the strength in faith.  I can show you the proof of that in science.  Faith is not blind anymore.  There's empirical evidence in the scientific world that now comes along.  The way I've said it is, back in the old days, scientific materialism and faith were at war with each other.  And you know, we all had to decide.  You're going to follow Darwin or Jesus, so to speak.  Amen.  But now science has changed in the last hundred years.  Beginning of the 20th century, it's changed.  And now science and faith can walk together arm in arm, actually complementing each other and getting along together.  And it's because science has repented.  I didn't say every scientist has.  Just like folks in the church, you've got hard-headed scientists who don't want to change their minds either.  Einstein was one of them.  Einstein, he railed against one of the early quantum physicists and he said about an experiment that had been done.  And he said, God doesn't play dice with the universe.  And the response was, you don't get to tell God what to do.  And that was from another scientist.  So it's exciting to take this new language.  And this is expansion from Grace Walt to quantum life.  And now I think we're gonna be able with this language to take it to a broader world. ",

He came in at the very, very end of the chapel service, the pre-breakfast chapel service.  His name's Emmanuel.  And he said to me afterwards, he said, what are all your different sources?  He said, I like what you said there, but he said, you know, what are all your sources?  And I held up the Bible and I said, this is the source.  This is my source.  And he said, well, that's why we're different.  Because he says, I bring science into this.  And he said, I bring, and he was using words that I'm sure that he didn't even understand.  But he was trying to make the point that I was limited by this one source.  But he said to me, he said, my name is Emmanuel.  Do you know what that means?  And I said, I surely do, God with us.  Do you know what it means?  And there was just this dead silence.  We have to know that it's all about God's grace, but that science and all of these other areas of life just affirm that. ",

Obviously, I learned from the Bible, and don't misunderstand, but the truth of the Bible can be seen through botany, through astronomy.  The heavens declare the glory of God, right?  That's astronomy.  So there are so many different voices in the choir, but all of it springs from the original truth.  of a loving God. ",
