How do you get into the marshal service, sir?  How do you get into the marshal service?  Do you have to have a certain number of years experience as a police officer or sheriff's department?  Can't answer that question?  No?  Not at all?  What's your name, sir?  Is there a record?  Wow, I mean, you come to Philadelphia is very welcoming.  Excuse me, sir.  You have a moment for a question about the DHS, please.  How do you become a FPS officer?  There's a couple ways.  You can go on USA Jobs, or you can go to a job fair.  Right.  You could start as a Federal Protection Service officer, or do you have to, like, have so many years as, like, sheriff or police officer?  It really depends what they're looking for in that time for recruiting.  Okay.  Sometimes they're recruiting military, sometimes they're recruiting fire officers.  Gotcha, gotcha.  So it just depends.  Alright, cool.  I was trying to ask this guy over here, but he just does not want to talk.  He saw the camera.  Just the camera.  It's kind of oozy or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Awesome.  Thank you for answering the questions.  Have a good one.  You too.  How you doing, sir?  We're security officers.  How do you become part of the marshal service?  I was trying to ask the guy down there, but he just didn't like the camera.  Too big.  Well, I mean, I'm unfamiliar with all that technology stuff, but, like, would I have to be a police officer for a certain amount of years or a sheriff's deputy?  Okay, you can't just jump right into it, right?  Right, I think so, yeah.  Okay, that's all.  Thank you, man.  All right, stay cool.  Yeah, you too.  You too.  I don't appreciate both of those.  Say nothing.  That's not nice, sir.  Why are you filming?  It's not nice without my permission to be filming.  We're out in the public.  Right where you're staying is private property.  You're misinformed, sir.  You're silly.  It's about a public easement.  Anybody can be here.  I can legally be here.  I don't want to argue that with you, but the arguments that I have don't mean anything.  It doesn't matter.  You're in a public space.  You have no obligation to privacy in a public space.  What's up, guys?  I'm here at Pennsylvania Transparency.  We're an immigration service ICE building.  We're building a park in Pennsylvania.  I got to get your license plate.  Keep going.  Let me tell you something.  This is public, all right?  This is public.  Don't get in my personal space. ",
