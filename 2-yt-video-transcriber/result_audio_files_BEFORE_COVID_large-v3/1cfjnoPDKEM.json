            "text": "hey guys so i wanted to come on here and talk about the first half of the 90 day fiance.  happily ever after tell all part one and this tell all really was focused mostly around chantel and pedro.  they weren't able to stay at the tell all filming.  they had to leave early.  so mostly this was focused on chantelle and pedro.  and i'm telling y'all chantelle annoys me.  the more i watch her interactions the more she annoys me because i'm seeing her evolve into a caricature of the ratchet belligerent aggressive black woman who can't be tamed can't respect her husband can't even allow her husband to speak.  um And that's something that Chantel has been doing.  I'm getting the vibe that Chantel is letting the popularity, get to her head.  i think the fact that she's been on the show for about what four seasons now i believe it is and she's getting the spin-off show.  i think that she's letting that go to her head.  hey guys i just want to give a quick shout out to everybody who subscribed to me on patreon and who continue to support via patreon.  if you want to become a patron and support you can click the link in the description box and become a patron to support the channel.  you can also support via paypal or through cash app and the links to those will be there as well.  if you choose to support via patreon you will get access to exclusive live streams exclusive content and any other content that i put there that is not on youtube.  On her social media, she gets praise.  She gets a lot of male attention.  I think she's allowing that to go to her head.  And I think it's turning her into the caricature of representation that they show on every show of a black woman.  If you look at Um, the Atlanta Housewives, if you look at Love and Hip Hop, if you look at Black Ink Crew, she's turning herself into that caricature.  I don't know if she's doing this to try to play it up and solidify her position on the show and make it a long-term career.  If she's trying to do it so that she can get other offers.  I don't know what it is that she's trying to accomplish, but I'm noticing a difference in her attitude.  Y'all let me know if y'all are noticing it too.  Aside from the regular way that she annoys me, she's... Taking on a different mentality and then it's irking me.  the biggest thing that irritated me about the tell-all was when they were in the rooms in the back waiting to go on stage to film and her and man titty Colts had a Run in and she couldn't even let her husband defend her.  that irked the hell out of me.  I wanted to jump through the TV and literally cuss her out because that irritated telling me if she's having an interaction with another man and If any woman is having an interaction with another man and your husband wants to intervene on your behalf and help you, why would you sit there?  And she basically shushed him and told him to be quiet.  She did the same thing to her parents.  But she sat up there and told her husband that she don't need him to speak for her because she can handle it.  This is the thing that I don't like about her because if you just watch that 90 Day Fiance with Chantel on there, it literally validates every dusty talking point that, The manosphere has had where she has like this attitude where it's overly aggressive.  She thinks she's the dominant one in a relationship.  Pedro seems like he's trying to fight her to have dominance and to be the man.  And that was just annoying to me.  There's no possible way if my husband is there and there's an interaction with another man.  I'm not going to allow him to defend me.  And she talks over Pedro.  She gets in his face.  like it's so annoying to watch.  I really want him to divorce her.  I really do.  The whole thing was just a sham.  It was embarrassing the way she treated him on there.  I mean, maybe y'all think I'm going a little bit too in on it.  I know of a couple people who watch this.  I know that they're past the point of annoyed with Chantel's behavior just like I am.  But y'all let me know because I know that some people may like her.  Some people may think that her behavior is appropriate.  I question what type of woman you are if you think her behavior is appropriate.  But in any event, some people think that her behavior is appropriate.  I personally don't.  I think of that horrible.  I think that the way she treats Pedro is trash.  I think that Pedro should divorce her and get someone else.  Now, there are rumors now that Pedro has been cheating, was caught cheating on Chantel.  I think that they may be doing that for the new show that's coming out.  But... You know, you never know with these reality TV people because they'll do anything to stay in front of the TV.  And I think ultimately that's what Chantel will end up doing.  All through the tell-all, Pedro just looked genuinely like he's stressed out.  And I feel like they're exploiting real-life issues in their relationship.  Because Pedro, the entire time, unless he's just a very good actor, which I don't really believe, but... Pedro genuinely looks stressed out.  He genuinely looked like he's tired of dealing with her drama and she seems like she just wants to put on this persona so she can stay on TV.  That's very, very, um, irritating.  Now they went a little bit into, you know, some of the other people, of course, with Larissa, they show that Larissa has a new man.  I'm, I'm, super glad that she got rid of man titty colt and got her a dude.  that's more of her speed anyway because colt wasn't on her level.  he's too much of a mama's boy like even in the sped show where they supposedly were showing what happened with colt and larissa's case which they really didn't give you any details at all.  they just showed um them going through the court process.  I wanted to know what really happened in the DV scenarios, which I suspect is just Colt using her immigration status against her to try to get her deported and control her.  But the fact that he had his mom go with him to see a divorce attorney, that's so disgusting.  And I actually am glad that Chantel called him out on it and told him that he acts like he loves his mom more than his wife.  and i think she should have worded it differently.  i wouldn't have necessarily said that he acts like he loves his mom more than his wife because immediately what popped into my head was that well i love my mom and i don't see anything wrong with that but i don't have a husband and any boyfriend that i've had.  of course I've loved my mom more than I've loved them.  so I what I would have said is that you know he's too codependent.  he acts like he's in a marriage with his mother because that's really what it is.  he's in a marriage with his mother and they act like Larissa was the side chick and she just came in.  that's literally how his mom acts.  his mom acts like Larissa is a side chick and she's ruining her relationship with her son Colt and I think it's disgusting.  and then he refuses to lose weight.  he's super big.  same thing with Nicole.  Nicole is there yet again at another reunion, and she will continue to be without Azen.  Everybody can see that Azen doesn't like her.  Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, any blind person can see that Nicole... Isn't favored by Azen.  Nobody really cares.  Azen doesn't care.  He just spends her money.  She keeps sitting there pretending like she's going to.  Did y'all see how she literally in the season tried to pretend like she was going to lose weight and sit up here and did two squats and ate a banana and a smoothie and act like that was going to do something for her.  The problem is that she doesn't genuinely want to lose weight.  And my thing of it is that's fine.  I think that you should love yourself in any form.  You should be healthy.  However, the problem is that she's with a man who is in shape.  He cares about his physical fitness.  He cares about his health.  She does not.  And so if she wants to marry him and he's asking her to lose weight, then she should be losing weight.  Or she shouldn't be surprised that she's not married to him.  She keeps saying that she's going to go to Morocco and they'll be married.  And... She said that in this scene, and I'm thinking, bitch, you already been to Morocco, though, and he still didn't marry you.  So what's going to be different?  Like, she scheduled a trip to Morocco.  He canceled it again, and she's talking about she has 100% faith in him.  Nicole is just a lost cause at the end of the day, y'all.  She really is.  Like, I don't like her segment.  She's one of the ones that I try to fast-forward through because I don't like her segment.  It's getting redundant.  Ads is not marrying her, obviously, okay?  So why are they still beating this dead horse, thinking that Azen's going to marry her?  Ivy wanted to jump through the TV and scream, he's not marrying you.  Like, how much more obvious does he need to make it?  If he wanted to marry her, he would have married her while she was there.  He wouldn't keep canceling the trips.  Like, Nicola, the sad case.  Now, they did go a little bit into Jay and Ashley's situation.  Ashley came there with a nasty attitude, of course.  But I am happy that she made that comment to Colt.  She just looks old, bitter, and gross.  Ashley is quitting the show.  Before the airing of the tell-all, she actually went on her Instagram and she wrote a statement and I'll read it to you.  She said, I can applaud Ashley for that because A lot of people write stuff in this all over the place, but at 33, she should be able to.  But anyway, she said, I'm sure next season won't disappoint.  You will get the opportunity to meet new couples and follow their journey.  It's time to step away from the show and focus on what's important.  I have been given so many amazing opportunities from this show, and I will be forever thankful to TLC and Shark Productions.  The amount of support I have received majorly outweighed the hate, and I appreciate every message that you so kindly took Time out of your day to write me.  I have felt the true meaning of love and heartbreak in many other lessons while filming the show.  I realized that there is a lot I need to work on with myself.  I know through all this I've learned some valuable lessons and that I am stronger than I thought I could ever be.  I love you guys and I am so thankful I was able to experience this with all of you.  And then she just hashed hashtag 90 day fiance happily ever after.  Now, This could be her either them telling her that because she's not with Jay and there's no more storyline there, that she's off the show, although I'm sure that they can make a storyline for them, especially make a storyline about her trying to get him deported or whatever.  But also, um... They she could just be really be quitting the show.  She could just genuinely not want to be in a relationship with him.  when she showed up.  Her body language and everything about her was really nasty.  She had a nasty attitude.  She said that she felt like she was stupid for dealing with Jay.  Jay's going to continue to cheat.  That's what she doesn't understand.  He needs to deal with the fact that he was so-called losing his virginity at the age of eight.  that right there created something in his psyche.  And the bottom line of it is, is that's just what it is.  She said in April of this year, Jay cheated on her again after she took him back.  So, you know, the thing of it is, is, is, is just, it's whatever.  The bottom line of it is, is Jay's going to keep cheating.  Um, Ashley says she's completely done.  She said that before.  So their storyline is over.  Neither of them will probably be on the show again.  Um, I know that Andre actually had the nerve to open his mouth to make a statement to say that he believed that Larissa scammed Colt.  And it's interesting, and I'm only saying this because they didn't really get into anybody else's story.  Most of it was focused on Chantel and Pedro, their spinoff show.  the dysfunction in their relationship.  I feel like they're exploiting black people again for profit.  but they always do just like that clip where on the 90 day fiance with David and Annie that one clip where they had Nikki and her brother Antonio there and when he cussed out and had that altercation with Dave they said that was the highest ratings in TLC history.  so of course with the amount of ratings that chantal and pedro get of course they're going to exploit the situation.  but i digress the.  when andre made that statement about somebody tricking someone i'm just sitting there like did he really just say someone tricking someone?  because he sat up there and told elizabeth that he was alpha male he was a man of the house he was going to work he was going to provide for her and yet he hasn't gotten one job since the whole entire show has been on.  He's literally been spending money that he doesn't have talking about.  they're going to pay for flights.  It's like you mean she's going to pay for the flight and she's going to pay for the wedding because you don't have anything.  You're acting like a dusty bum.  Like I will literally tell and it looks like she is on the next episode of it.  She's going to tell him, you know, you're trying to be the head and the man of the household while she pays all the bills.  And to me, that's a mindset that a lot of men have in society today.  specifically within our community, where they don't want to pay the cost to be the boss.  They think that they're going to be the boss just on the merits of them being a man, and that's really just not how reality works.  You don't get to not pay any bills, not bring anything to the table, and still be the head of the household.  But when it's time to write a check for a light bill, you're looking... To her or her dad.  It doesn't work like that.  So, I mean, the thing of it is, is we'll see what happens next week on it.  The bottom line of it is, is that again, there wasn't that much to cover on this episode of the tell all except for Chantel and Pedro's new story.  um spinoff show.  and if y'all want me to talk about that y'all really are gonna have to give me some good reasons because chantelle is irking me.  there's a tiny part of me that wants to watch it honestly because i actually like pedro.  i feel bad for pedro.  i'm hashtag teen pedro.  but in any event um y'all will have to let me know if you want me to watch that and review it.  i know um before the 90 days is coming up.  It's coming up on the 4th.  That'll be right after I get home so I can.  I'm going to review that.  They have Michael and Disgusting Angela on there again and she's trying to get that old struggle womb impregnated.  It's not going to happen.  Um, they have some new couples on there, so I'll probably do something before the airing of that show to introduce the couples and kind of go over some background, um, of those couples as much as I can find in the meantime.  But I will definitely be reviewing before the 90 days.  if you guys want me to talk about Chantel and Pedro.  again get in the comment sections.  let me know why I should do that because Chantel ignore annoys me.  I'll probably watch the first episode just to see if I want to watch it but as long as you're putting attention on somebody else which it looks like they're going to be focusing on her sister and her sister's I might I might watch it.  y'all I really I might as well watch it and review it for y'all.  that's fine you don't have to vote.  I'll I mean, still get in the comment section and tell me why you want to do it.  But I'll probably do it.  Just for the sheer foolishness and buffoonery of it, I'll do it.  But in any event, thank you guys for watching.  Do check out the other 90 Day Fiance reviews.  And I will definitely see you guys in the next review.  Like, comment, subscribe, share the video. ",
