            "text": "Okay.  Here's a 2019 GMC Sierra Denali 2500. we just did for Harley with GMC.  It's got a BDS six and a half inch kit on here that we cranked up a hair.  It's about seven inch height right now.  Put on the Fox 2.0 shocks front and rear.  Got some 37 inch Nixon MT tires.  Kind of a nice aggressive look.  They got a cool looking sidewall on these guys here.  put some fuel 20 by 10. this is the new fuel stroke it's called with a nice offset doesn't stick out too much.  also we added on these bushwhacker color match fender flares.  same color really ties into the truck real well.  plus it gives you some coverage over here we need in hawaii turned out really nice really good looking truck.  it's got a real nice stance to it here with these 37 inch tires on it.  good clearance on here.  a real nice height for a 2500 series truck.  Any questions about this build or any other build, leave a comment in the comment box and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.  Thanks for watching. ",
