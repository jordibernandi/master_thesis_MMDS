A 25,800 mAh huge capacity external battery pack with dual output port with LED status indicator for iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Android phone, tablet and more.  Alright, so let's check this out.  So this battery bank is supposed to have two cells inside.  It's very heavy and nothing's moving around inside, so it definitely feels like there's a legitimate battery in here.  I don't think I got ripped off.  This looks like it has one light on it right now for charging status, so I think we're gonna have to charge this up.  All right, so this is my charger for the power bank.  that I'm using, and right now it shows me that we are drawing .74, .77 amps.  When it first started, we were drawing about, just making sure, yeah, that's the only thing plugged in.  We were first drawing about 48, now it said 58.  It goes back up to 74.74 amps.  So it's almost taking a whole amp to charge that device.  So just so you know, if you're going to charge it, you want a USB power brick that at least puts out one amp to charge this power bank.  Alright, so I finally got this to charge up.  It took over 12 hours for this to fully charge from 1 to 4.  And then I plugged it in again just to verify that it was charged.  But it charged a little bit more and then it stopped.  So I've got my phone here.  It's 92% and I had it in power saving mode today.  But now I unleashed all 8 cores of the CPU goodness at full speed on this phone.  And now it's down to 92%.  I'm going to go ahead and plug this in to the 2.1 amp output, which is what this has got.  Okay.  And we're going to plug this in.  Now, I know there's a way... To find out if this is actually charging at 2.1 amps or not.  Now it doesn't mean my phone will.  Okay my phone for whatever reason doesn't like to draw a lot of power.  But I got my flashlight on.  I got my screen on bright all the way.  And I'm going to see if I can find another app on here.  Forgot to mention that whenever it's charging it automatically gets out of the battery saving mode.  It won't be.  whenever this phone is charging it will not go into battery saving mode.  So just as I expected my phone is telling me.  that we are charging at 910 milliamps.  I got a phone call.  Now it's charging at 850, so here you go, 850, 910 milliamps, that's what it keeps showing that it's charging at. ",

            "text": "Alright, so it is after 7 a.m.  in the morning.  I left this plugged in all night.  I turned it on this morning again to make sure it was charging because it automatically turns off.  I ran 3DMark twice on this thing this morning.  And the battery, is at 99%.  It's still charging back up.  But this thing kept up with it during the 3D mark and stuff.  It didn't drop.  It still kept gaining on charging.  And I had the Wi-Fi on, of course, the whole time too.  I checked my messages this morning.  I checked my work orders for work, which reminds me I got to do two jobs today, it looks like.  and uh so anyways this is after like 14 hours of uh cell phone usage.  you know night morning whatever of course when the phone you know you shouldn't turn it off at night it.  it doesn't use as much power but you know just to give you an idea.  so if you're using your phone all day every day then yeah, you might get one bar to drop.  You know, playing video games or something on it, watching YouTube all day.  I don't use my phone like that.  I just make calls and get work done and occasionally I'll check my messages.  I don't run an OpenGL, you know, Slingshot Extreme benchmark every day, so I ran that twice today so far.  I found out if you record these in the videos, YouTube will actually demonetize your videos because of the footage from 3DMark.  But I just think it's funny how this graphic here moves around when you tilt the phone, that the graphic actually moves.  Anyway, so thanks for watching the video.  The links to these things are in the description of the video.  So go out and get one.  Have some fun.  And God bless you.  Thanks for watching. ",

            "text": "Bye.  First thing you need to know before you get into law is there's a resource out there you need to get.  So you have to know the basics of law.  what they do and how they do it, the lawsuit way.  To learn that, there's a link in the description of most of my videos that says how to win in court.  And you might see a thing up in the corner of the video that you're watching over there, a card or something.  And basically what it is, is it's a thing you pay, I think, $250 for, I think, a year of access to it.  You can go through the course in, I'd say about a week.  They probably say you can go through it faster than that.  and you want to write down everything you learn and uh they've got like a lot of copyright stuff.  so you they don't want you copying the videos or anything so i can't say to do that.  but uh basically you want to get through the program and get to the end and then if you know you paid for it and everything registered in your name They give you a fancy certificate or something.  at the end, I guess, that shows you completed the school and passed their tests.  But learning that, learning the basics of that fills in all the gaps and gives you a good starting point before you learn law. ",
