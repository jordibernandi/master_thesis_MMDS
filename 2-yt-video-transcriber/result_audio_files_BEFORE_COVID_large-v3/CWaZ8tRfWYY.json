Now, of course, as we all expected, Christians responded in their typically dignified, mature manner.  And by that I mean they all shoved past each other trying to be the first to publicly lose their shit about it.  In fact, they're the ones who made me aware of this episode by sharing this post from the Family Research Council on Facebook.  because, of course, if you want the world to know about a gay wedding, all you have to do is sit back and let the Christians generate all the publicity for you, and the article, along with the ensuing comments, got me interested enough to make a video about it.  Now, of course, the typical formula for doing this is to find a Christian video on the topic and do a response, and it's a formula that makes sense.  If you find someone who sums up the other argument well enough, responding to them puts a face on the opposition, helps drive the narrative of your video, and adds a little dramatic flair.  But here's the problem.  When I went to look, and I really tried, pretty much all I could find was just a couple people randomly whooping and hollering. ",

The honest fact of the matter is these videos really are so lazy, so mundane, there's seriously no substantial argument for me to break down.  Sure, I could spend ten minutes getting cheap laughs by riffing on Jericho Green, but that wouldn't add to anybody's understanding of anything.  So sure, it's worth making passing reference to the fact that clowns like him exist and are unfortunately part of the conversation.  But because the only weapon in their arsenal is a bald-faced demand for social dominance, there's not much to be said to or even about them.  However, there are a couple points in the Christian response that start to sound like a legitimate argument.  They surface occasionally from time to time, often in incomplete, haphazard ways and usually too thinly spread across other rhetoric to be of any use.  But I did find one person who more or less managed to sustain it for a full minute in this clip. ",

You're thinking you're watching a good and wholesome show.  It's been on for like 22 years.  A lot of kids have enjoyed it over the years.  I mean, I saw it when I was a youngin' as well.  But how would you feel if all of a sudden you got two gay men dancing on screen and the kids are there, they're enjoying it, talking about this is fantastic, this is great.

            "text": "Now these kinds of points are where this gets interesting.  Because they represent a certain growing awareness among Christians that most of our culture generally values tolerance and personal freedoms.  And if they want to be conversant with and relevant to the rest of society they need to speak this language to some extent.  And this has led to some changes in how they interact with others.  See, when society first started saying, look, where there are two belief systems, belief A and belief B, then if we're all going to live together, we need to include and accommodate both of these beliefs.  Then back in the day, Christians more or less got away with saying, fuck you, we're belief A and everybody else should be belief A because we say so.  But really, since this is the ideological equivalent of give me all the toys, there's no tenable way to argue for it.  And as Christians lost some of their iron grip on society, those who were self-aware enough to notice and care about this softened their tone a little and devised a way to give their dominionist attitude a place in the circle of tolerance.  And the best way I can think to describe this method is by recreating an argument that I unfortunately came up with in my latter years as a right-wing Christian.  Basically, it said, sure, I get what you're saying about belief A and belief B. But if we're going to be truly tolerant to everybody, we need to acknowledge that there are two different stances about the relationship of belief A and belief B. One is that they are both acceptable and should be tolerated.  The other is that they are not.  And if we are all going to live together, we need to accommodate both the people who think they're acceptable and the people who think they're not acceptable.  Now there's a lot to unpack here, both in the kernel of truth behind this argument and, much more extensively, what it oversimplifies and gets terribly wrong.  And while I might do that at length sometime, I don't want to now.  For the moment, I just want to draw attention to how the religious right has tried using this thought process to justify itself.  All this A and B nonsense may be new to you, but I'm sure we've all been exposed to some language about how we need tolerance or inclusion not just of nationalities and lifestyles but of ideas, and that if conservative fundamentalists aren't allowed to act out their beliefs in the public sphere, they themselves are being discriminated against.  An obvious example would be the whole Kim Davis thing.  Most Christians, at least those I heard from, didn't argue, f*** you all.  she had the right religion so she should be allowed to discriminate against homosexuals.  Instead, they argued that she as a Christian had the right to exercise her personal conviction in carrying out her role as county clerk.  And expecting her to do something that violated that conviction, like issuing gay marriages to homosexual couples, is as discriminatory as prohibiting gay marriage.  In short, they tried to assume a defensive posture, claiming they didn't want to intrude upon anybody else, but they also didn't want anybody intruding upon their right to private belief.  And now some Christians, and the only ones constructing anything that can be plausibly called an argument, are adopting this posture toward the Arthur episode, saying, We don't want to oppress homosexuals, even though they're vile and sinful and disgusting and God used to command people to kill them, but just as they want the right to live their lives without others intruding in their bedrooms, we just want to raise our kids according to our values without others intruding in our homes.  And if our religious convictions tell us homosexuality is wrong, you're oppressing us if you tell us we can't raise our kids to believe the same.  With the provision that you should love the sinner and hate the sin, of course, because we're not the hateful types.  Now setting aside the quality of what's being taught, which within reason is not the topic of discussion when we're talking about parents' legal rights to train their own kids, this is a reasonably compelling argument.  Or at least it brings something to the table, right?  No matter what we believe, none of us likes the idea of others entering our homes to undermine our parenting or show our kids things we think are inappropriate.  That's why those who made at least a half-hearted effort at making their complaints against PBS sound legitimate seem to focus on two things.  One, PBS should not indoctrinate kids into thinking gay marriage is right.  Two, it should not show kids things that are inappropriate for their age.  The first one characterizes PBS as swooping in and actively teaching Christian kids that they should think gay marriage is okay, thus telling them something that runs directly contrary to their parents' religious instruction.  And this accusation is usually made using loaded language like brainwashing or indoctrination, often with the insinuation that PBS and the liberals behind it are trying to turn kids against their parents.  The second seems to be implying that, by portraying a gay wedding, this cartoon was depicting something that was in some way sexual or at least put awkward or developmentally inappropriate questions into the minds of kids.  So with these possible objections in mind, let's look at the horribly controversial content this episode showed kids.  Basically after a long buildup in which Arthur and his classmates worried Mr.  Rathburn was going to marry a severe woman they saw him with, we see this. ",

            "text": "over.  No, kids were not directed to believe anything about homosexuality or gay marriage.  Nothing at all sexual or developmentally inappropriate was shown, because a gay wedding doesn't constitute explicit homosexual content any more than a straight wedding constitute explicit heterosexual content.  All this episode showed was a man getting married and his students being happy for him, with no direct commentary about what kids should believe.  If this episode confronted your children with anything new, it was just the idea that there are people outside their immediate home and church circles who are perfectly happy, healthy, and kind, despite the fact that they might live in a way that's different from and possibly disagrees with your religion.  If you feel this idea undermines your parenting or is so developmentally challenging that your kid shouldn't be exposed to it, that's something you need to reflect on.  Thus we quickly discover that all insinuations Christians were making about this show are flatly misleading and any of these semi-legitimate objections fall flat on their asses once you see what actually happened in the episode, demonstrating in the clearest terms what fundamentalists really mean when they demand tolerance for their position.  Seriously, why were Christians objecting to this?  The only thing I can possibly come up with is that the episode portrayed characters doing something that runs contrary to their specific religious doctrine.  But you know what?  A lot of people in this world live their lives in a lot of different ways.  And any media that reasonably portrays any diverse group of people will eventually show them doing things that some of us don't totally agree with.  So if the only problem is that this episode shows characters doing something Christians consider sinful, then the only solution is to run every single thing that every single character on every single show does through a religious test designed to ensure that all programming falls in line with Christian teaching.  Franklin Graham practically admitted as much when he asked, why should the government be financing PBS programming that promotes what the Bible calls sin?  Yes, that's right.  With his characteristic lack of self-awareness, Graham openly came out and said that tax dollars should only fund material Christians approve of.  That's what this is about, plain and simple.  Acting like they're just on the defensive, like they just don't want other people coming in and indoctrinating their children, they're aggressively expecting to shape our nation's media to conform with their religion.  They don't want their children to as much as see diverse groups of people acting contrary to their religious dictates, and because of this they expect not decency but control.  As in almost all cases such as this, they've packaged their quest for dominionism as a call to tolerance, and it is absolutely unacceptable.  Unless we're to live in a theocracy, or non-religious equivalent, nobody can demand that all programming align with their personal convictions.  Sure, just like Christians, I don't want the government indoctrinating my children.  I don't want them being led in school prayer or Bible study, and I don't want the Ten Commandments displayed in public buildings.  However, if I were to publicly melt down the way Christians do every time a TV program, for example, showed sympathetic characters happily going to church, that would be a totally different thing.  I actually value my children seeing other people living different ways because I want to humanize and normalize people who are different from us.  But that's beside the point.  Regardless, if I wanted that kind of control over what appeared on TV, people would recognize the kind of power grab I was going for.  They would recognize that I didn't just want my kids not brainwashed, but that I wanted an inappropriate and frankly dangerous level of control over the media.
