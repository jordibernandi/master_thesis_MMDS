            "text": "Simply put, we must repeal the salt limits included in last year's tax bill.  All across my district, Republicans, Independents, and Democrats have had the same message.  That the salt cap is unfair, that it's penalizing people that choose to make California their homes, and that it's stretching families thin when they're already feeling the squeeze from the high costs of childcare, housing, and prescription drugs.  Estimates indicate that 37% of taxpayers in my home district, the 45th, used the SALT deduction, and they had an average deduction of $18,200.  By capping the deduction at $10,000, many middle-class families saw their effective tax rates go up in 2018.  What's worse, the tax bill imposes a marriage penalty.  While unmarried individuals can each file for $10,000 worth of SALT deductions, totaling $20,000, a married couple together can only claim $10,000.  Estimates suggest that more than 42,000 residents in the 45th District of California were no longer able to deduct their full property taxes from their federal tax bill.  This policy is anti-family and it is inconsistent with Orange County values.  I'm not alone in my concern about the SALT cap.  Earlier this year, I sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy with 24 of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, demanding that House leadership bring SALT repeal up for a vote.  I appreciate the committee holding this hearing, but frankly, I'm frustrated that the action on this issue hasn't moved sooner.  For Orange County families, they've already dealt with one year of higher tax bills and they can't afford another year.  This April, I held a tax town hall in the 45th district.  My neighbors simply could not understand why middle class families in California were being penalized while Amazon paid no federal tax in 2018.  They couldn't fathom why their effective tax rate would increase while Wells Fargo received a $3.7 billion windfall from the tax bill.  I wanted to read to the committee just a few comments from my constituents that I've collected during just my first four months in office.  With your permission, I'd like to enter the full list of constituent stories into the record.  Without objection, such will be the order.  Rachel from Laguna Hills told my office, we owe $4,700 this year and had a return, a refund, last year.  We own a small business, but the corporate tax cuts really didn't make much of a difference to us, even though we are an S Corp.  The cap on SALT is overtaxing middle-class homeowners in Orange County.  Our taxable income is about $150,000, which places us in the middle for California.  We employ 10 people, and the tax salt cap makes it difficult for us to grow our business as we are wary of our personal financial situation going forward.  Susan from Irvine wrote to me, many of us in California's 45th are retired and have to work to fund and manage our retirement income.  With the new tax law, our income taxes are increasing by $5,000.  Others we know who have changed nothing face a total loss of a refund or a tax bill nearing $10,000, basically due to the loss of salt and other deductions.  This is very hard on retired people who don't have the time or the opportunity to alter their financial situations.  Lorise from Mission Viejo said, the change in the SALT deduction affected my taxes this year in a very negative way.  Because of the cap, I lost $7,000 in deductions.  As a single mom with head of household filing status, the SALT deduction is my biggest deduction on my taxes.  We need to get the cap removed on SALT deductions.  We shouldn't be penalized for living in a state with a high cost of homes.  One final point I want to emphasize to this committee, the median home price in Irvine, California, the largest city in the 45th district, is $860,000.  But my constituents are by no means living extravagantly. ",
