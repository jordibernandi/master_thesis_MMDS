            "text": "What's up?  I'm Shailene Woodley.  I chose to join Greenpeace on this expedition because late last year I made a commitment to myself that I was going to spend 2019 learning about the ocean.  You know, when we're out here right now in the middle of the Sargasso Sea and you look over the edge of the boat and not only do you see giant pieces of macro plastic, plastic bags, plastic crates, old buoys, rope, line passing by, We're collecting thousands of teeny tiny little pieces of microplastic.  The UN needs to create a global oceans treaty to protect the Sargasso Sea along with all the seas in the world.  To be honest, the biggest highlights have just been connecting with the crew.  Y'all are... crazy AF in the best way possible.  We went night diving last night and I got to snorkel at the top.  I only speak from a place of transparency and honesty and integrity always.  And I can tell you that I will be not only devoting a large percentage of my my personal money to this organization, but also my time.  And as a reminder, because this is really important to note, Greenpeace takes no corporate or governmental money.  Go to their website and just find out how you can volunteer.  And I think that once you do that, you will be hooked. ",
