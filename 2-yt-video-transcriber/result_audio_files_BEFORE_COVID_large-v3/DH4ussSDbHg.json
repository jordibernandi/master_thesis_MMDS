Wonderful stuff, people.  Even though we see so many missions come through, every single mission touches my heart.  It's all very, very special.  And the fact that it's growing, the fact that it's working so well is just, you know, it's beyond a dream.  So thank you all so much and everything that you do to make this happen.  Just want to quickly give you the stats.  So these are big, big missions.  We had 230 people attend over these two missions.  We gave out 60 normal sized Bibles.  We gave out 30 large.  and 20 children's Bibles.  That's 110 Bibles he gave up.  Wow, that's a lot.  So everything that you've seen in the photos, the whole mission cost $767.  And we had 16 people say yes to the Lord Jesus.  So this is a tremendous... ",

So it shows us the demand for the Bible out there.  A lot of people out there are in poverty.  They can't really afford a Bible.  It's very expensive for them.  And so we're supplying that demand free of charge.  to them and you know it's working.  you know we've given up thousands of bibles and with your continued support we pray that it carries on.  I think it will.  I think it's going to grow and grow and grow and you know it'd be great if we covered huge parts of Pakistan before the Lord returned.  it would be good if we had a huge shift.  yeah You know, in Christianity out there, a massive shift.
