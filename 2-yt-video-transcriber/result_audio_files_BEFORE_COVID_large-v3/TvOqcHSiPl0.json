            "text": "Welcome back for today's video where I'm going to be filling out a hypothetical 2020 electoral college map between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.  And going to be talking about Bernie Sanders here because he has officially thrown his hat in the ring and announced that he is going to be running for the presidency in 2020.  Now, Bernie Sanders, he has a lot going for him this time around that he didn't have back in 2016.  That gives him kind of a built-in advantage.  He's going to be a force to be reckoned with within this Democratic primary process.  Starting off, he has overwhelming name recognition in 2020, which is very important in having success especially in a field that's getting bigger and bigger by the week.  having the ability to separate yourself from the pack in terms of having that overwhelming name recognition is very important specifically when a field is as crowded as this and then also his grassroots support that he was able to build up back in 2016 is starting right off the ground and running here for Sanders in 2020.  That email list, small dollar donations, in terms of all the candidates that are running in 2020, I don't think any of them are going to be able to rival Sanders in what he's been able to build up and what he'll continue to build going into primary season with that high level of grassroots support and small dollar donations.  donations.  now in terms of what we've seen with the polls it's a situation where the two candidates with the most name recognition joe biden bernie sanders have separated themselves from the rest of the pack.  but you also have biden who is a little bit ahead of sanders consistently in a lot of these polls.  but in terms of approval numbers sanders does extremely well amongst the 2020 democratic primary field amongst minorities such as african-americans as well as Latinos.  He's also doing very well in his approval numbers amongst women, as well as young voters.  And it's really not even close when we take a look at the cross section of voters.  If we're looking at those under the age of 40, Bernie Sanders absolutely crushing the field that is currently announced that they're gonna be running and having that young support can definitely help Sanders in trying to outperform what the polls are currently saying about him.  And there's a couple of things here where these polls tend to have their models where they statistically project what you can expect to see in a primary in terms of the amount of voters that you're gonna get from each age category.  But Sanders, he could possibly get a surge model because of higher participation amongst young voters who typically don't turn out as well in primaries as the older age demographics.  Also, he's the anti-establishment candidate.  That really boosted his chances back in 2016, getting a lot of these unlikely voters to come out and participate in the political process.  He can also do that this time around with those anti-establishment voters who who want something different than just the mainstream, moderate, establishment-backed candidates within the Democratic Party.  Now, he has to close a gap right now between himself and Joe Biden.  Biden hasn't officially announced.  So if you have a situation where Biden doesn't announce, that makes Bernie Sanders the clear frontrunner.  But if Biden did announce, there are some ways that Bernie Sanders could try to catch him.  And it being their history and track record on a lot of important issues, things such as the war in iraq biden was supporting it.  bernie sanders of course was one of the only people who voted against it in the senate way back in the day but also more recently joe biden support of tpp for instance where bernie has been against it if we go back to the 90s.  joe biden a strong supporter of the crimes bill which was really devastating to the african-american community where bernie sanders was against it.  the list goes on and on.  also we can take a look at joe biden.  Back in 2018, in a very competitive Congressional House district in the state of Michigan, he went and actually helped Republican Fred Upton go on and push him over the line in winning his election bid in what was, like I said, a very competitive matchup, a winnable district for the Democrats.  You know, they say a lot of people within the establishment wing of the Democratic Party that Bernie Sanders, he's not even a Democrat.  So why would he even run?  But they would never say anything like that about Joe Biden, even though he's going out there and helping a Republican like Fred Upton, where we've never seen Bernie Sanders do anything like that in terms of boosting the electoral chances.  of Republican candidates.  And then moving on from that, he's also single-handedly reshaped the Democratic Party platform.  Bernie Sanders, he doesn't get enough credit for this, but where the Democratic Party was going into the primary in 2016 is a very different party than where it is at today.  And basically all of that can be thrown on the shoulders of Bernie Sanders, where he's pushed this party to a situation where if you even want to run for the presidency.  now, you have to be for things like Medicare for All, a living wage, tuition-free public universities.  The list goes on and on, the way that he's overall reshaped the Democratic Party.  So he's going to be a force to be reckoned with.  He's already doing pretty well in the polls, but now that he's officially announced, that's likely to boost his numbers up a little bit.  And like I said, it's going to be very tough for any of the other candidates to compete with the grassroots support and the small-dollar donations that Bernie Sanders is going to have behind his candidacy.  So now I want to go through and fill out the rest of this electoral college map.  I'm going to start out West, move my way into the Southeast, go up to the Northeast and then finish in the all important Midwest.  So starting out here, the Southwest is an area where the Democrats have continued to gain a lot of ground, particularly in the states of Nevada and Colorado, which are becoming more consistent for the Democrats.  It seems on a year to year basis.  This is also an area of the country where the Democrats are gaining because of the demographics that are more favorable to their party.  It would be really shocking if Bernie Sanders in particular wasn't able to win Colorado as well as Nevada after Hillary Clinton was able to win these two states in competitive fashion back in 2016.  But also Arizona, we saw one poll recently where a generic Democrat had a four point lead over Donald Trump and Trump didn't do all that well in Arizona back in 2016, winning it by about three and a half percentage points.  The Democrats in 2018 were able to flip this Senate seat from Jeff Flake's old seat.  Of course, he didn't run for reelection, but Kyrsten Sinema going on and taking this and this is the next state it seems to fall in the Southwest where Nevada and Colorado are already becoming more consistent for the Democrats.  It seems like Arizona is going into a purple situation, and maybe within this 2020 cycle is where the Democrats are finally able to go ahead and start claiming it more consistently.  I'd give Bernie Sanders a slight edge here out in the state of Arizona.  Now moving to Texas, it's going to be really tough for the Democrats to try to win this state, but we have also seen the demographics helping the Democratic Party a bit here in the state of Texas.  Hillary Clinton lost the state by single digits, but it was still, I believe, around 8 or 9 percentage points.  So a pretty big gap there back in 2016.  If you have a candidate, perhaps like a Beto O'Rourke, might have a chance to go on and take the state.  Even candidates like a Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden could have an outside shot at perhaps going on and upsetting in the state of Texas.  But still at this point in time, you'd have to give the lean over to Donald Trump and the Republicans until we actually see some Democrats either doing much better in the polls in these head-to-head matchups or proving that they can actually win these statewide elections.  Now moving over, into the southeast where we have georgia and florida now georgia extremely close racer statewide in the governor's race in twenty eighteen and amongst all these other southeastern states george actually becoming a bit more of a purple situation even though the republicans are still winning the statewide elections thereby thinner and thinner margins of the areas in and around atlanta have become a bit more liberalized a lot of the suburban areas And that's where the population is within the state of Georgia.  So having these districts in and around Atlanta that are becoming a bit more competitive is kind of changing the whole scene within this state and making it a lot more competitive.  Perhaps Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders have a strong enough brand where they can go into Georgia and maybe close the gap, make things really interesting with Donald Trump.  But still, at the end of the day, I'd give the slight lean over to Trump and the Republicans.  There's also going to be a really competitive 2020 Senate race within Georgia.  That's going to be worth watching out for.  Now, Florida, back in 2018, was one of the few states where the Republicans actually performed quite a bit better than what people were expecting.  They won the statewide race with their governorship as well as flipping a Senate seat.  Really good news for the Republicans there.  And Donald Trump has a lot of support here within the state.  It's going to be tough for any Democrat to come in and try to take down Donald Trump.  And Florida, it seems like these are always really close elections in presidential years.  I actually think Bernie Sanders has a decent shot at trying to go on and upset Trump here.  But still... At the end of the day, I'm going to give a slight lean to Donald Trump.  He was able to win the state by a little over one percentage point back in 2016.  We do have to also remember the Democrats under Barack Obama was able to win the state of Florida back in 2012 and 2008.  So it's certainly within the realm of possibility that the Democrats could go on and win this one.  But I'd like to see some more polling data before we go ahead and flip this one over to a candidate like Bernie Sanders.  Although I think he does have a decent shot at going on and also winning a state like Florida.  So now moving up.  a bit here going into the state of North Carolina.  And we've seen Democrats do a little bit better here recently.  The governor's race in North Carolina, of course, went to the Democrats fairly recently.  And also the last time the Democrats won the state in a presidential year was all the way back in 2008, which was a really strong showing from Barack Obama.  It has a very high African-American population in the state of North Carolina, which helps the Democrats' chances here.  We've seen some polling.  actually coming out of North Carolina with hypothetical matchups for 2020.  And the only candidates that had a little bit of a margin over Donald Trump were Joe Biden as well as Bernie Sanders.  At this point in time, I think I would give just a very slight lean over to Bernie Sanders in his head-to-head against Trump in this state.  And what's a purple state, going to be very competitive in 2020.  Now, Virginia, it's actually been a state that's trending really well for the Democrats over the past decade.  But given what's going on, within the Democratic Party in this state is pretty devastating and likely to hurt them, perhaps going into 2020 with all the drama that's going on in the governor's mansion, for instance, and those that are in leadership in the Democratic Party in the state of Virginia.  But I actually think that this can help somebody like a Bernie Sanders quite significantly.  He's viewed as an outsider, anti-establishment, an independent, not necessarily having that Democratic crown over him.  like all of these other candidates would have in Virginia.  And I think that actually could play to his advantage because of that anti-establishment wing of the Democratic Party in the state of Virginia.  If we look back at the governor's race, Bernie Sanders refused to come out and endorse Northam after he had endorsed his primary opponent, in that race.  And a lot of establishment Democrats were furious at Bernie Sanders for this.  But now, of course, we look at hindsight and it seems like this is almost always the case with Bernie Sanders, where if we go hindsight, he was right not to do so in going in and not supporting Northam was definitely the right way to go for him in that one.  I think that can help him here.  I would give Virginia as a pretty decent lean over to Bernie Sanders in that result.  So now going up into the Northeast.  And this is where I think Bernie Sanders can do extremely well.  Of course, he is the senator from Vermont.  That means I think New Hampshire is pretty much a lock for Bernie Sanders to go on and take.  Maybe you give it one lean over because it is a bit more of a moderate state than the rest of these Northeastern states, but it would be shocking if Sanders wasn't able to pick up that result.  But also the second congressional district of Maine, the Democrats were able to pick it up In 2018, because of ranked choice voting, that can also help Sanders here, of course, in 2020.  And again, I think that this is an area where Bernie Sanders can do very well.  Going to just put it as a lean to him because Donald Trump did so well here back in 2016, but I wouldn't even be surprised if he was able to win it straight up.  Without taking in ranked choice voting into consideration.  So now going in to the Midwest, which is where these are always won.  And this is an area where I think Bernie Sanders can do extremely well.  There's a lot of white working class voters who have a lot of support for Bernie Sanders and his campaign.  if we look back.  in 2016 where in his head-to-head matchup against Hillary Clinton, he was able to win in primary states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan.  Iowa was basically a tie and that was before people even really knew a whole lot about Bernie Sanders.  But also if we take a look at Nebraska's second congressional district, it was extremely close back in 2018.  The DCCC pretty much abandoned the very progressive Democrat that was running in this district, Kyra Eastman, and she was still almost able to go on and win.  It lost it by about two percentage points.  I think that particularly within the Midwest, as well as even some of these plain states, Bernie Sanders can do very well, starting off with Nebraska's second congressional district.  I give him the lean in this one in his head-to-head matchup against Trump.  And before going through and filling out the rest of these Midwestern states, I also think that there's a case to be made where Bernie Sanders could actually do pretty well in very competitive, possibly in very Republican presidential-leaning states like Montana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Indiana.  Of course, Hillary Clinton coming up way short in these states, but she's not the kind of candidate that can do well in these types of areas where I think Bernie Sanders can do a lot better and have a lot more success.  in these particular results.  I'd love to see some polling data, head-to-head matchup between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in some of these interesting, what would be considered safe Republican states anyways, in a presidential year.  But now going through, starting off, Minnesota, a very left-leaning, at least more left-leaning than your typical Midwestern state, probably the only other Midwestern state that you'd put further to the left than Minnesota would be Illinois.  That would be a very safe one, we feel, for Bernie Sanders.  Moving over, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all states where Democrats were able to win the Senate races and statewide, as well as the governor's statewide races back in 2018. things are trending very well for the Democrats here in 2020.  And if they pick the right kind of candidates, such as a Bernie Sanders, I actually think that these would be pretty safe results.  Even if we go back to 2016, Sanders and his head-to-head matchup against Trump was having consistent double-digit leads over Donald Trump in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that Hillary Clinton simply did not have in the polls in terms of that margin over Donald Trump.  So we would actually put these as one step below being locks for Bernie Sanders against Donald Trump.  And then that puts us Iowa and Ohio, two states that the Democrats were able to win in 2008 and 2012, but came up short in 2016.  These again are areas where I think that Bernie Sanders can do very well.  There's a lot of similar voters in Iowa, in Ohio that we see in states like Of course, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania.  I'd actually give just a very slight lean to Sanders in Ohio as well as Iowa in what would be likely very competitive results.  So at the end of the day, this is how I currently have the Electoral College playing out in a head-to-head matchup between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.  Bernie Sanders at 330 electoral votes, Trump at 208.  Even if I would give the slight lean areas over to Trump, it would still only put him into a situation where he would have 260 electoral votes, which isn't enough to reach that 270 votes.  that you need now.  you could also make a case that Bernie Sanders could possibly win Florida.  that would make it even more of a landslide 359 to 179. but again this is where I have it finishing up 330 to 208 and that's going to wrap up this video.  guys thanks for stopping on in consider subscribing for more and I hope to see you back here for future videos.
