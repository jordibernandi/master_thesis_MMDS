Today we're in the village of East Hampton, New York, and we just saw this cop pull over with his lights flashing, so we're going to come check it out.  What's going on?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I'll be right back.  I mean, I can take that, too.  Because you weren't driving.  This is me and Parker.  Right.  Okay.  I think we should go shop.  Thank you.  The sun's not straight now.  Oh, so bad.  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  Looks like we have a fascinated onlooker here.  We'll close this through.  Okay, can I get your name and badge number?  I'm Officer Morales, number 238.  Officer Morales, 238.  I'm sorry, what was your name and badge number?  Oh, you bet.  Is that what you tell the judge?  Okay.  Good, good, good, good.  It's written wrong place and wrong time and something like that.  Yeah.  Alright, thanks for the call.  Get that puppy.  Get that puppy.  This is not going to be seen.  It depends.  I never know until it is.  What we do is I'll tell you what we do.  Well, let me tell you what we do.  So I'm here to make sure, as crazy as you might think this sounds, even in Little East Hampton, New York, that your rights are not violated and that the officer is not doing anything.  that's not supposed to happen.  And you may think off the top that doesn't happen, but it does.  So we're here for you.  No nefarious activity, no ill will, no ill intent.  Just doing my job.  You guys have a good day.  And you know what?  I heard the comment.  you said that you might have been at the wrong place at the wrong time.  I think you might have been at the right place at the right time because somewhere else something worse might have happened.  Have a great day.  All right, guys, so nothing much really happened there.  We're going to... Hop back in the truck and see if we can find anything else.  Watching the Watchmen, out. ",
