He's the author of Trump on the Couch.  Previously, he wrote Obama on the Couch and Bush on the Couch.  Bush on the Couch was particularly eye-opening for me.  That was a remarkable book.  Obama on the Couch was fascinating.  His Twitter handle is JustinFrankMD.  And his books, of course, are available any place you can get books.  Dr.  Frank, welcome back to the program. ",

And they saw a West Side Story on Broadway and got fascinated by switchblades.  And they started buying them and hiding them.  He had a nine-inch knife.  He had a couple of really huge knives.  And his father finally discovered them and sent him off to military school immediately.  He felt that he could not cope with Donald.  Donald has a delinquent mind.  He hates regulations.  He hates being told what to do.  And he's gone out of his way to live a secret life where he can do whatever he wants out of the void of rules.  The only person who really understood him was his own father, who was also... basically a criminal and a racist, but he did understand his son, Donnie.  Yeah. ",

He was born in Germany, and he had changed his name from a German name so he could rent to Jews, at least, because there were a lot of Jews in Queens.  What about Donald?  that he is really like the son of the mob family.  And unconsciously, he wants to break things.  He wants to do things secretly and avoid any kind of rules.  And the only person he felt really got him was, he felt in his fantasy life, was his father and then Mueller, who instead of throwing him out of the House in Queens, was going to throw him out of the White House.  So I think he was terrified.  He is so relieved that Mueller did not say indict, indict.  grow out.  And because of that, I think he feels that he's gotten the blood check to continue to do whatever he's doing.  He is not a person who's interested really in anything.  This morning, in fact, some people were talking on the morning show about how come He doesn't even do anything to help himself in the polls, like do a few of the promises, like fixing infrastructure or doing certain things.  He actually doesn't because he doesn't care about those things.  He's not interested in polls particularly.  He's interested in, obviously, in money and getting away with things and in breaking things.  And he has been devoted to doing that ever since he was a kid.  I don't know what else to say. ",

Donald has a brilliant group of lawyers.  He's always escaped the law.  But his goal is to demolish things.  And he pretends.  to be a builder.

He disconnects, she doesn't talk like a psychoanalyst, but she's talking about disconnecting us from ourselves, from each other.  He disconnects people.  He breaks the normal connections.  So it's very hard to follow him.  He floods us with tweets.  He makes it very difficult for people to think and respond.  And he is relentlessly brilliant at that.  But he's disconnecting thought.  He's attacking our capacity to think.  And I think that's a very hard thing.  We have to sit back and think.
