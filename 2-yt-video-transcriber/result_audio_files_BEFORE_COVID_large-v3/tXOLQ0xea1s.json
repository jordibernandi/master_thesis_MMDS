            "text": "Let's just imagine for a moment that armed militants in the Great March were shooting back at Israeli soldiers during the protest, which would actually be protected as legitimate resistance under international law.  United Nations General Assembly Resolution of 1978, particularly armed struggle.  Even if there was an armed battle, all the documented actions of the Israeli military against children, disabled, press, and medics would still be considered highly illegal war crimes.  But the fact that there were no armed militants, were no use of weapons against soldiers, was no battle, as they say, makes their crimes that much more atrocious and undeniable.  In fact, the official IDF Twitter account admitted on record that none of those shot were by accident.  According to officials, nothing was carried out uncontrolled.  Everything was accurate and measured, and we know where every bullet landed.  Even more damning, Israeli General Zivikov Fogel described how snipers identify and are given authorization to shoot children. ",

I know how many licenses he needs before he gets a license to scream in the fire.  It's not a piece of paper or something else that recognizes a small body of a child and decides that he's going to die.  Someone signs the goal for him and tells him exactly why he needs to die and what the threat of that one is.  And unfortunately, sometimes when you see a child in a small body and you intend to hurt him in the hand or in the shoulder, in the area of the State of Israel... So a death sentence?  A death sentence, yes.  If it's possible to die here, just... in order to stop him with a leg or a great hand.  But if it's more than that, then yes, if it's... ",

Thank God, I'm fine now.  The next Friday, we went out with the guys again.  We arrived in Ghad.  I got shot in my left leg.  At 8-5, we went to Malka with the guys.  I was carrying a Palestinian flag, just like the guys.  I was asking for a return with the guys, just like them.  I got shot in the head.  I got shot in the head, inside and outside.  I got shot 55 times in the head, inside and outside.  Then we did a surgery to remove the scars from the head.  After a few days of removing the scars from the head, Their goal is to remove the youth from the Gaza Strip.  To destroy the youth's future.  So that they don't defend the country anymore.  So that they don't go back to prison.  Because the youth's city has fallen.  No one will defend Palestine. ",
