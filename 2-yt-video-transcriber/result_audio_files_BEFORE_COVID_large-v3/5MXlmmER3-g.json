And then after we were fed and in bed, our mother would sit up trying to figure out how to make it all work.  That's something most Americans know all too well.  And that's what my 3 a.m.  agenda is all about, a real plan to help you solve those worries.  the biggest middle-class tax cut in a generation, another $500 in your pocket every month, paid for by repealing Donald Trump's tax breaks for the top 1% and the richest corporations in America.  Health care for all with Medicare for all.  And for companies that don't pay women the same as men, new fines on their profits until they do.  That's what I'm fighting for.  Real relief for families like yours.  Not in 20 years, not in 30.  Starting my first day as president.  Because you've waited long enough to get a good night's sleep.  I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message. ",
