So Leo, why do you think it's important that someone who's queer and trans should be doing this kind of work, life modelling?  A lot of people always Don't really think.  about disabled people having much of a body image and a sexuality to do.  and put my work through writing it and also diversity speaking I hope to change people's views a bit and people with cerebral palsy can be out of their bodies And the fact that I am trans gets kind of another layer on that story.  I think it's important for people to understand that a disabled person has so much more to them than just their disability.  I'm a transgender man.  I had several palsy and I'm also gay.  And that's not too much.  Thank you. ",
