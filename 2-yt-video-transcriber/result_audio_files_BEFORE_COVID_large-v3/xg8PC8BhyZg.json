            "text": "Mr.  Chairman, with this budget and the Trump budget that was released a couple of weeks ago, my Republican colleagues, I think, have made it very clear that it is the party that wants to throw 32 million Americans off of the health care that they have, wants to eliminate protections for preexisting conditions for people who have serious illnesses, wants to defund Planned Parenthood, wants to prevent children from staying on their parents' health insurance plans until the age of 26, wants to substantially increase healthcare premiums for older Americans, wants to make major cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, nutrition assistance, and affordable housing, but also wants to continue to provide over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% in large profitable corporations.  Mr.  Chairman, I do not believe that those are the priorities of the American people.  Those priorities may work very well for the top 1% and large profitable corporations, but not for ordinary Americans.  And I hope that we will be able to offer some amendments today that will significantly change the priorities in this budget.  Mr.  Chairman, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when we have three families in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of the American people, when 46% of all new income is going to the top 1%.  The American people want a budget whose priorities reflect the needs of the middle class and working families of this country, not just those on top.  The First Amendment that I'm offering today, Sanders 2, is simple and it's straightforward.  It simply establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to repeal the Trump tax breaks that go to the top 1%.  Under this amendment, 83% of the benefits of the Trump tax plan would no longer go to the top 1% by the end of the decade.  In fact, the top 1% would get 0% of the tax cuts under this amendment.  This amendment is about stopping the Koch brothers, the third wealthiest family in America, with a net worth of over $100 billion from getting a billion dollar tax break.  Frankly, the Koch brothers do not need a billion dollar tax break.  This amendment is about stopping other billionaires from receiving enormous tax breaks.  This amendment is about stopping Amazon, Netflix, General Motors, IBM, Federal Express, Berkshire Hathaway, and John Deere from paying nothing in federal income taxes after making billions in profits.  I have the feeling today that we're going to hear a whole lot about the deficit.  And yet you have major corporation after major corporation making billions of dollars in profits, not paying a nickel in federal income taxes at a time when we have massive social needs in this country.  So, Mr.  Chairman, having said that, I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  My second amendment is simple and straightforward.  It would allow this committee to keep the campaign promises made by Donald Trump not to cut Medicare and Medicaid and not to provide tax breaks to the wealthy.  Over and over again, as I think we all recall during his campaign for President, Trump told the American people that he was a different type of Republican, that he would not cut Medicare and Medicaid.  Well, actually he was not telling the truth because in his budget he did just that, despite saying over and over again, including on May 7th, 2015, when he tweeted, quote, I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  That's what Mr.  Trump said during his campaign.  Unfortunately, that is not what he has done as President of the United States.  As I think we all know, his budget proposes a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid, an $845 billion cut to Medicare, and a $25 billion cut to Social Security.  In America today, as we all know, Medicaid pays for more than two-thirds of all nursing home care in our country.  This massive cut to Medicaid would be a disaster for millions of families.  Medicaid obviously also provides desperately needed health care to low-income people and to our children.  So, Mr.  Chairman, the President told us he was not going to cut Medicare.  President told us he was not going to cut Medicaid.  Let us hear what the president said during his campaign and do just that.  And I ask for support for this amendment.  Look, let's be clear.  We are the only country, major country on earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right.  We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care.  Of course we spend a lot of money on health care.  Twice as much per capita, yet our health care outcomes are worse than many other countries.  When you talk about cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, understand that the number of Americans receiving will be eligible for Medicare will go up by 10 million people from 60 million to 70 million.  And the number of Americans receiving Medicaid will also go up by 10 million over the next five years.  So you're seeing more and more people eligible for these programs.  You're seeing health care inflation higher than general inflation, and yet we are not addressing that issue.  So if you really want to have cost-effective health care for all, you might want to look at a Medicare for all single-payer program.  But the last thing in the world you want to do is cut Medicare and cut Medicaid and cause more health suffering in this country and more death.  Senator Sanders?  Let me respond to Senator Kennedy by saying this.  Senator, do you know who the largest welfare recipient in this country is?  Well, let me suggest to you that it is the wealthiest family in this country, the Walton family that owns Walmart.  They are worth about $170 billion.  Yet they get huge amounts of welfare.  You know why they get huge amounts of welfare?  Because they pay their workers wages that are so low that many of these workers are on Medicaid, They are on food stamps.  They are on public housing because they can't get by on $10 or $11 an hour.  So if you really want to deal with welfare in this country, let's pass a $15 an hour minimum wage and take the Walton family off of welfare.  Thank you.  Let me just very briefly quote from the AARP.  And the ARRP says that the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the courts, which is what the Trump administration is supporting, would, quote, allow insurance companies to once again charge people with high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or other conditions up to 10 times more than what others pay for the same coverage or deny them coverage altogether.  This would be devastating to the estimated 25 million older adults with a pre-existing condition, end of quote.  If you vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you're voting to end protections on pre-existing conditions.  As an opposition?  No, not an opposition.  It's not against the rules for me to support an amendment from a Republican colleague, I think.  The only point that I want to do is I support the amendment.  But Senator Grassley and others, when we deal with disaster relief, it is absolutely imperative that we deal with it in a nonpartisan way.  Disasters strike states that are Republican.  Disasters strike states that are Democratic.  Disasters strike territories like Puerto Rico, which have a very high percentage of their American citizens having fought and died in our wars.  So the only point that I want to make is, yes, Nebraska and Iowa need help.  I support that.  But when Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, you may recall.  that some of your Republican colleagues were not so sure they wanted to support disaster relief in Democratic states.  So let us be clear, and I hope we can be unanimous on this.  This is the United States of America.  And no matter where a disaster strikes, it is the role of the federal government to be there, whether it is a Republican governor, a Democratic governor, an independent governor, or whatever.  So with that caveat, I certainly support this amendment.  In opposition?  Senator Sanders?  Okay, let's be very clear.  When the American people express in poll after poll contempt for the United States Congress, this is one of the reasons they do.  As Senator Grassley no doubt knows, this estate tax applies to the top one-tenth of one percent.  You got half the people in this country are living paycheck to paycheck.  You got 40 million people living in poverty.  You have the very, very rich doing phenomenally well, better than any time perhaps in history.  This estate tax applies to the 1,700 wealthiest families in America who inherit over $11 million in wealth.  Now, I hear year after year all the family farms in America are going to be hit by this.  I represent the state of family farmers.  Dairy, mostly.  To the best of my knowledge, not one farmer in the state of Vermont will be impacted by this.  And in fact, in 2017, only 20 farms and small businesses in the entire country owed any estate tax.  And even the conservative American Farm Bureau has never been able to find one family in America that has ever lost a farm to the estate tax.  Not a single one.  This tax applies to the top 1 tenth of 1%.  And if at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, you think the very, very richest families in America, the Walton family, we get a tax break of up to 63 billion dollars.  Koch brothers would get an enormous tax break.  Their family would.  So if you think those guys are the people who need a tax break when our infrastructure is crumbling, when kids can't afford to go to college, I guess you could support that amendment.  I think it's a bad idea.  Senator Sanders.  Mr.  Chairman, I want to thank Senator Harris for offering this amendment.  You know, there are some issues that are out there that we just don't talk enough about.  And one of those issues is the crisis in affordable housing.  All over this country, you have people who are spending 40, 50, sometimes 60% of their limited incomes to put a roof over their heads.  And when you spend that kind of money, you don't have any resources available for other needs.  Several years ago, we managed to get past working with Congresswoman Lee in the House, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund, It needs substantially more funding.  There are other programs that need funding.  Bottom line is it is not a radical idea to say that in America every person should be living in housing that is safe and affordable, and this amendment takes us in that direction.  Let me respond.  You know what?  How much is enough?  I'll tell you how much is enough.  This is the richest country in the history of the world.  You should not have many, many hundreds of thousands of people tonight, including a few blocks from here, sleeping out on the street.  That's how much is enough.  This amendment would create a deficit neutral reserve fund to fully audit the Department of Defense and outrageous cost overruns and crackdown on the massive amount of fraud are perpetrated by defense contractors.  I wish I could tell you it was a brilliant new idea that I thought of, but it is not.  This idea has been around for a long time.  On September 10, 2001, one day before 9-11, then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said, and I quote, according to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.  We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building, the Pentagon, because it's stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible, end of quote.  Yet almost 18 years after Secretary Rumsfeld's statement, the Department of Defense has still not passed a clean audit despite the fact that the Pentagon controls assets in excess of $2.2 trillion or roughly 70% of what the entire federal government owns.  Meanwhile, over the past two decades, virtually every major defense contractor in the United States has paid billions of dollars in fines and settlements for misconduct and fraud, all while making huge profits on those government contracts.  I hope that my colleagues will support this important amendment.  This amendment simply states that we should honor what Donald Trump said during his campaign and that there will not be cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.  And I would urge in a roll call vote people supporting this amendment.  We do not need at a time when so many people are uninsured or underinsured to be making massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.  Mr.  Chairman, in March of 2019, the GAO reported that, quote, many DOD programs continue to fall short of cost, schedule, and performance goals.  Consequently, DOD often pays more than anticipated, buys less than expected, and in some cases delivers fewer capabilities to the warfighter.  End of quote.  This amendment simply calls on the Defense Department to pass an independent audit.  Yeah, let me just say a word.  Yeah.  Look, I want to applaud the chairman and his staff for their hard work.  Preparing a budget, as we all know, is not easy stuff.  But the truth is that this is a disastrous budget for the middle class and working families of this country.  Let's understand what this vote is about.  If you vote yes, you're voting to throw 32 million people off of the health care they have.  God knows how many of them will die.  If you vote yes on this, you're talking about taking away health insurance coverage from Americans 26 years of age and younger who are on their parents' health insurance plans.  If you vote yes on this, you are substantially increasing premiums for older workers and raising prescription drug prices for senior citizens.  Furthermore, at a time when kids can't afford to go to college, you're going to be cutting back on their ability to do that.  There's a housing crisis.  You're going to be cutting back on affordable housing.  You're going to be cutting back on child care, cutting back on transportation and other basic needs for working families.  And all in the name of continuing to give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country who don't need them.  I urge a strong no on this budget.  Thank you. ",
