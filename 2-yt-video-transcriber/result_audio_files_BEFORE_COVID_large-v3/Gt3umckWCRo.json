But today I wanted to talk about something a little bit different, something that I haven't talked about in quite some time.  I was reading through some of the comments on my most recent videos earlier today and I stumbled upon a comment, more of a question, asking if it's absolutely necessary to store your silver in a safe or if there are better alternatives just because safes are so expensive.  You know, some of them are hundreds and hundreds of dollars, some of them more than that.  And the question was, do I absolutely need to get a safe?  Now, the short answer is no, absolutely not.  You do not need to.  Just like theoretically, you don't need to lock your doors at night.  You don't need... to go to work should but you don't absolutely need to.  so the short answer is no.  you don't absolutely need to have a safe but it's called the safe for a reason.  it's a way of keeping your belongings safe.  I personally have a save.  I have two safes actually and I have other means of keeping my silver protected which I can't really get into in a YouTube video.  they're not really a big fan of that.  but if you are unwilling to invest the money in a safe something that I actually use when I first got started stacking I at first was unwilling to spend a large amount of money on a decent safe.  So what I did in the meantime And I don't necessarily recommend this.  However, if you do not have a safe, if you are unable to get one just yet, or if you cannot afford a safe, I do believe this can kind of hold you over in the meantime.  It's like this little shoebox size lockbox.  Like, you can get one.  It's very small.  It's about the size of a shoebox.  It can very easily be picked up.  It can very easily be pierced into and torn open if need be.  So it is absolutely not the safest or the smartest thing to store your wealth inside of.  However... In the meantime, I do believe that something is better than nothing.  If you want to get something like this, I will include an Amazon affiliate link in the description.  If you want to check it out, if you want to get one for yourself, it doesn't necessarily have to be for your silver and your gold.  It could be for whatever important documents you which is pretty much what it's supposed to be for anyway, and it's fire-resistant, which can absolutely help in the event of something bad happening.  What I would recommend you do with something like this, if you are somebody who does have a safe, I think it's a good idea to get one of these as well.  And what you can do is you can lock it up, and put it inside of your safe.  So in a weird way, it can be viewed as almost like a precious metal bug out bag, if that makes sense.  The way I see it, if you put a decent amount of silver inside of it, and then lock it up inside of your safe, If you ever absolutely need to get up and get out, you know, worst case scenario, you need to leave, you need to evacuate, you need to whatever, and you have 30 seconds to open up your safe and grab the security box, toss it into the trunk of your car or whatever, and drive off, rather than panicking and being completely unable to put your safe in the trunk of the car.  Maybe it's too big to fit in the car.  Maybe it's too heavy to carry out the door.  Maybe it's bolted to the ground, as it should be.  You're going to end up feeling screwed, for lack of better verbiage.  If you do not want to get a security box, or a lockbox, or whatever you want to call it, something else will do.  But I do believe... in what i'm showing and the reason for that is because i've had one.  i've had several for years and years and years.  initially it was for documents you know passport tax information stuff like that.  i always kept important documents and files inside of it and then when I first started stacking I was actually using that as an alternative to a safe because I either didn't have the money for a large safe or maybe I did have the money and I was just unwilling to pull the trigger just yet.  this is what I was using in the meantime.  so maybe you're a brand new stacker.  maybe you only have 5, 10, 15, 20 ounces of silver.  maybe you only have a very small portion of gold and you want something because at the end of the day, something is better than nothing.  I do think that this would be a good idea.  I do think that it would be an even better idea to put inside of a safe, assuming that it's large enough to fit the lockbox, which isn't that difficult because like I said earlier, it's about the size of a shoebox.  Most people can probably fit a shoebox in their safe.  I personally think it's a good idea.  At the end of the day, the answers to the question are initially on whether or not a safe is absolutely necessary.  In my opinion, I think it is really important.  I do believe that you should have one.  Do I think it's a requirement?  Do I think it's absolutely mandatory?  Theoretically, no.  You don't need one.  You're not going to, you know... crumble without one, but you're probably going to be a whole lot better off in the way I see it.  You can view it as an investment per se.  I don't like throwing that word around, but if and when something were to happen, somebody enters your home without permission, they're snooping around, they're taking what they want, there's a good chance they're going to have an incredibly tough time breaking into a safe, assuming that it's, you know, a nice big bulky safe and not some cheap one from Walmart, they're going to have a tough time.  And first and foremost, before all that, the safe should be well hidden.  They should have an incredibly tough time finding the safe, and if and when they do find it, they're going to have an even tougher time getting into it.  And for extra safety, I would recommend bolting it down to the ground, in which case it's near impossible to remove.  That's what I would recommend, and I would like you guys to head on down to the comments and let me know if you have a specific safe that you would recommend.  What is a safe that you would steer clear of?  Is a little lockbox something that you think could potentially be at least a somewhat decent idea for the beginner stacker who maybe isn't overly involved just yet?  At the end of the day, something is better than nothing.  It beats leaving it on the kitchen table.  So if you guys want to pick one up, I will be linking it in the description.

Do you think that putting a small shoebox-sized lockbox potentially inside of a safe as a Somewhat of a precious metal bug-out bag or bug-out box.  A portable safe inside of a safe.
