And do you know what else can happen in the few centuries that a tree could remain standing after death?  sedimentary deposition.  And while creationists would have you believe that mainstream geologists insist that deposition takes thousands of years at a minimum, the truth of the matter is that it depends entirely upon the depositional event.  For the chalk deposits that made the White Cliffs of Dover, it took millions of years.  But not all depositional events are created equal.  A volcanic eruption can leave a layer of ash in a hurry, lava flows can go right along with that, mudslides don't take long either, and yes, even floods can wash in sediment rather rapidly.  In the case of Joggins, Nova Scotia... No, that's a Nova Scotian jogger.  There, that's better.  Anyway, in Joggins, the older, bigger trees grew in a layer of soil that was likely similar to that found in a peat bog.  After it died, its base was covered by another layer of sediment, in which other, smaller trees grew.  At some point, these smaller trees also died and had a coarser sediment build up around them, in which still more plants grew.  There are several layers which contain evidence of life going on normally within them, from animal tracks to the growth of other trees.  That's quite a neat little trick to accomplish.  if all these layers formed in one flood over the course of a single year.  What kind of tree grows at the bottom of an ocean again? ",

And when it turns back into water, it releases that heat.  With the amount of water vapor that would be necessary to sustain your vapor canopy, the heat released just by turning all that vapor back into water would be enough to raise the temperature of the Earth to 6,000 degrees.  And I hear the pedants in my audience asking, is that Celsius or Fahrenheit?  Well, we're talking about humans existing at 6,000 degrees.  Does it matter?  Either one sucks balls.

            "text": "Nope, that's not really a good bit in favour of the flood.  It may have been a mystery at one point, but plate tectonics solved that.  From about 200 million years ago, the Indian plate has been moving toward the Eurasian plate, and is being pushed under it, or subducted.  There used to be an ocean separating India and the rest of Eurasia, but as the Indian plate was subducted under the Eurasian plate, the sediment from the ocean floor was deposited on the edge of the Eurasian plate in an accretionary wedge.  When the two plates finally collided about 50 million years ago, this sediment was pushed up into the mountain range that we know today as the Himalayas.  This process is still going on, and as a result, Mount Everest grows at a rate of about 1.2 centimeters per year, which I guess technically means that every person to reach the top sets a new record for the highest a person has ever climbed, if only by a few nanometers.  Anyway, since the Himalayas are literally made out of sediment that was on an ocean floor that got scraped off onto another continent when its own continent was being subducted, it's no surprise that there are marine fossils on Mount Everest.  It does present a problem for creationism, though, because the way flood deposits work, bottom-dwelling marine creatures would not have been swept up to the mountaintops, but down into the valleys.  So their presence on a mountain is completely unexplained by a global flood.  And that's ignoring the fact that they exist as if they were just going on about their normal lives, not being swept up in a flood. ",

A group of people live in a place, let's say the Iraqi flood plains, since that's where this particular flood myth originated.  One day, there is a flood that is a lot larger than normal and kills a lot of people.  The people who lived through it then tell their kids who were born after it of a time when all the land was flooded and most of the people and animals died.  Not hard to see how that could, in a relatively short time, grow into a legend about a massive worldwide flood which only one family survived. ",

You keep trotting that out as if there's some juicy detail that scientists are trying to hide, but it is well known and easy to find.  And to suggest that no animal today ever experiences a rapid burial just goes to show the absolute enormity of your ignorance.  That's it for this one.  Looks like we have fossil trees, marine fossils on Everest, many flood myths, and the fact that Kent has never personally witnessed the fossilization process as our main lines of evidence for the flood.  That's pretty weak, Matt, even for you.  Next time, we get into how dinosaurs and people lived together before the flood, apparently.  My comment of the day today comes to us from JW, who says, Now, I might be mistaken about this, but there is a person who keeps popping up on my videos to tell me to stop fishing the bottom of the barrel and respond to real apologists.  This person will often drop names like William Lane Craig and Frank Turek as examples of these real apologists.  I think that JW here is that person, but I'm not quite sure as I can't find those other comments at the moment, so I can't actually verify that, but I seem to recall that it is this person.  But if it is him, it's quite telling that you aren't convinced by my arguments until I deal with, quote, real apologists, but as soon as I do deal with one on your list, you switch it up to attacking credentials.  Anyway, to respond to what JW is actually saying, I do not, in fact, have a PhD in biology.  And I said as much in the video that this was posted on, so obviously you didn't watch it.  But Turek also does not have a PhD in biology, nor does the lawyer that he used in that video as his main source of information on evolution, a very biological topic.  Turek may very well be quite a bit smarter than me in some areas, but biology is definitely not one of them.  The man doesn't even realize that evolution is the explanation for the diversity of life.  Instead, he brings up diversity as if that's a major challenge for evolution.  That's a basic grade school level misunderstanding.  So remember to follow me on Twitter and Facebook and support me on Patreon.  See you next time. ",
