            "text": "three big reasons why you should be very careful about dating a single mother.  now it is back to school time here you know you'll start to see that kids are going back to school.  all of that and with that I just saw a post from a guy who just got married and He married, at the time, a single mother who had a kid who is 5 and 8 years old, both from different fathers.  They have different fathers, right?  He just married her.  And this video is going to be a warning.  for at least three big things to watch out for when you're dating a single mother and this one is tough for me to say now.  I'm speaking to you men about this but is a general human being.  for those of you that don't know I was a public school teacher.  I taught second grade for five years.  I know that that a kid with two parents in the household does better, especially having that masculine or that male figure in the house.  I know that that's a good thing as far as the family goes.  But for you as a man, it is a huge risk on you to assume that responsibility.  And before we get into it, Skull Vikings, I'm a Vikings fan.  Let me know your NFL team below because the Vikings, sorry guys, sorry to everyone else, Vikings are winning their first Super Bowl this year, or theoretically in 2020.  But you know what I'm saying, this season.  Alright, anyway, three reasons to avoid dating a single mother, or at least to be very aware of.  And the first one is... Pretty obvious.  And that is money.  Kids take up a lot of money.  You are now not only, you know, we've talked about this before. ",
