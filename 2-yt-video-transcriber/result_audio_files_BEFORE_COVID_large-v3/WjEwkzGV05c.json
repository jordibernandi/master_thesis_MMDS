            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  It's Kiwi back with another video and it's been a while.  There's definitely no doubt about that and we're going to have a very very honest conversation about that About the reason why it's been a while since I've put a video up.  But first I want to pre-qualify the video by recovering Or going over the deep spiritual soul counsel work that I did after my separation and then my divorce during 2003 and then into 2004.  If you're a returning sub to the channel, you'll know that I've mentioned this before in other videos.  If you're new to the channel, I've spoken about this in previous videos, and I will actually do another video brushing over that specific subject.  So what I'm trying to say is that I'm not suicidal in any way, shape or form.  But as the description says below, you know, we're going to be talking about men's mental health.  And in all honesty, now I understand clearly, unequivocally.  Why Men Commit Suicide.  I really, truly do.  I mean, I've ran, over the last 15, 20 years, I've ran the spread of emotions and gone through trauma and everything to really, really understand, I mean, legitimately understand this subject extremely well.  So, what happened last month, one of a better term, I had a massive fucking meltdown.  Straight up, massive, massive meltdown.  And what it did, or what its basis was in, was literally not knowing who I am.  And that's the God's honest truth.  See, what had happened over the past 15 years, after my divorce... It felt like I was going to war.  It felt like I was going to battle every day.  I had to stay in my daughter's life in some way, shape or form.  The mother, even though she said she wouldn't get in the way of me being able to see my daughter.  That ebbed and flowed.  We would go through phases where it was absolutely a-okay, and then we'd go through phases where my wife or my ex-wife would make my life an absolute misery in regards to being able to see my daughter.  And I really do mean a misery.  It's like I had to fight to see my daughter in just some form of regular basis.  I had to fight to keep my daughter safe.  What happened was when the separation went down, my ex-wife moved to Camarillo, California.  And I actually ended up moving to Camarillo, California to actually stay in my daughter's life.  And so I had to reestablish myself in a completely foreign town.  Nobody knew me in this town in any way, shape or form.  So I ended up in this area, going through a divorce, going through some of the most brutal therapy, shadow work that I think any man could ever possibly go through.  I mean, I had an extremely abusive childhood.  So I had to recover that groundwork, because after the divorce, all that BS that happened in my child just came bubbling to the surface.  So what happened was I was fighting to stay in my daughter's life.  I was fighting to see my daughter in some form of way on a regular basis.  And not only that, you know, I was fighting for my sanity.  I was fighting for my own personal peace.  Reputation.  because what happened was the reason why my ex moved to Camarillo was to be around her family.  and what happened was You know she being an American me being the foreigner Americans gonna be leaving an American before they'll believe foreigners.  so she started slandering me.  and And it was just it was all endless absolutely endless.  I had to fight with even therapists because You know, my daughter started struggling in school, and you can't blame her, you know, with the bullshit that was going on in her life.  You know, and the mother was constantly moving.  Like in the kid's first 10 years of her life, she moved house like eight plus times.  It worked out to just moving just about once a year.  So the kid was changing schools and everything.  The kid, it was such an unstable life for my daughter.  It was any wonder she was struggling.  And then on top of that, my ex-wife's eldest daughter, my ex-wife had her first daughter when she was 18 years of age.  And then had my daughter when she was 38 years of age.  And what happened was, sadly, the eldest daughter for about 12, 14 years was an absolute narco.  She had a raging drug and alcohol problem through rehab, through being arrested, you know, all sorts of just ridiculous stuff.  And my ex-wife would leave my daughter with that daughter, her eldest daughter.  So I had to fight.  Every week there was something going on.  It just felt like you were going to war, some sort of battle, some sort of fight.  And then on top of that, I started my own business in the town.  And starting my own business, that had its own range of problems.  After I built a couple of outstanding custom cars, I had a couple of the local shop owners, hot rod shop owners in the area, starting to talk shit about me at car shows, starting to slander me.  One guy, I actually had to, after going to his shop, for the third time going to his shop, I actually told him, I said, if I trace any more bullshit, back to your mouth, I will do jail time.  I will promise you, you will never be able to work on cars ever again.  That's how fucking bad it had gotten.  So what happened was, last year, after fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting in every respect for my life, like, literally just sheer fucking survival, okay, my... My daughter and her mother, they had loft horns, and my daughter's off to the University of Colorado.  I was begging my daughter not to go.  But anyway, my daughter and my ex-wife had a whole other plan going on.  And what happened was... My daughter, boom, off to Colorado, University of Boulder, Colorado.  She was only there for a couple of months.  She realized it was an absolute scam.  And within the first couple of months of my daughter going to Colorado University, my ex-wife was like, later dude, see you.  This woman that I was constantly fighting with, constantly going to battle with, she was constantly causing drama, misery, pain, you freaking name it in my life.  She just packed everything up and moved to Nashville, Tennessee.  She'd actually been wanting to move to Nashville, Tennessee since before I even met her.  But she just bounced.  So I'm left in California just like, what the hell is going on here?  My daughter's not around me anymore.  The child that I'd fought tooth and nail to stay in her life and keep her safe as best as I possibly could, gone.  And then the person that was causing me all this misery and drama and everything, gone.  And I didn't realize just how severe that was.  I didn't realize the implications of just being cut loose was going to become.  So what happened was I carried on working.  Everything's good.  But then what I decided to do is I decided to move back to New Zealand.  As I've mentioned in a couple of other videos, a few of you will know I'm back in New Zealand now.  So anyway, that being cut loose, that being just dropped like a wet rag, that just being left behind, just being turned on, that all came to a head last month.  And I was just like, oh my God.  that it was just brutal.  I can't even begin to explain Just the feelings of loss, bewilderment, not knowing who I was, not knowing what I'm meant to do.  Even though I've got an amazing job, I've worked for an incredible corporation here in Auckland, New Zealand.  I mean, I am set up.  I live in an amazing area.  I've got a beautiful little cottage.  Life couldn't be better.  However, it was all this stuff, all that stuff from that past 15 years just went, just freaking smashed into me.  And it was, like I said, it was brutal.  And here's the thing, this is why I can say in the description section 100% why I know why men now commit suicide.  Because men, as men, we work our asses off.  We do, we're so diligent and we really genuinely try to do the best that we possibly can by our wives, by our children, by society, by our bosses, by everybody.  And when you just get dropped like a wet rag And you're just cast out into society.  It's brutal.  It's absolutely brutal.  It's like the world doesn't care.  It's like you're just another wet rag.  You're just another used tampon.  You're just another, you know, just like they say in the military, GI, your government issue.  You are disposable.  You are expendable.  You are of absolutely no more worth, value, or use to us in any way, shape, or form.  And more so in America because America is one of the most heavily armed countries out there.  It's easy to get a pistol and blow your brains out.  So... That's what happens.  This just getting dropped.  You work your ass off to provide a house, safety, security, whatever.  It's no different to the guys that go overseas, that join the military and they want to fight for freedom, fight terrorists and all that sort of horseshit.  They come back to a society that just doesn't care about them.  They come back to a society that's like, yeah, whatever, dude.  So what?  You did X, Y, and Z, you know?  They come back to a world that absolutely doesn't give a shit about them.  It's not like the Second World War where the troops were coming back and they had ticker tape parades.  They had women wanting to have children with them, wanting to have sex with them.  Wanting to show them how much appreciation they had for them.  No, why so?  A lot of these guys are off in the military.  Their old ladies are banging other guys.  They're screwing their buddies.  Even their buddies are fucking them over.  And it's just like, dang, dude.  No wonder there's so many people just... I mean, seriously, because if you're not stable, like I said, I thank God.  I've done all that deep soul counsel shadow work back in 2004, 5, 6.  I did it for years.  I did it for years, like three years.  That's how much work it took to clean out all the bullshit that was inside me from my childhood.  Straight up, if I hadn't done that work, one, I would never have made it through the past 15 years.  And two, I would have blown my fucking head off last month.  I mean, that's it in a nutshell.  Because... Us guys, we're not taught to take care of ourselves.  We're not taught that, you know, society is going to throw you out.  We're not taught that we're completely disposable.  I mean, straight up.  I'll give you a perfect example.  I said to my brother the other day when I was at lunch with him, I told him, I said, because he's got female problems and everything.  And I was just like, dude.  You don't allow women to treat you as a disposable fucking commodity.  They are disposable.  There's more females on the planet than there are males.  It's like you need to get it through your thick head that you aren't a disposable commodity.  You are a commodity.  So you need to figure out which female, if you want to have a relationship, is going to respect you and appreciate you for who you are.  Not just settle for some broad that's willing to suck your dick.  Because they will use you and they will spit you out like wet fucking rags.  That's the God's honest truth.  Straight up.  And this is the thing.  It's like, this is the ancient story.  Straight up.  Honest to God, this is the ancient story of like Achilles and the Battle of Troy.  He spent 10 years going to battle with his demons.  Going to war with his demons.  That's what the Battle of Troy is a symbolic representation of.  And Helen of Troy brought Achilles to his knees.  Helen of Troy literally led Achilles, the single greatest warrior.  And in the story, because it's a spiritual analogy, he was this incredible spiritual warrior where he went to battle with his demons and he fought them and he beat them.  But it was a female that brought him to his knees and brought him to his death.  And that's why we have to be so careful.  We have no business, men have no business getting married if they've got any sort of BS, any sort of... minutia, any sort of just junk from their childhood or anything like that.  And especially men should not be joining the military and going to war.  That's why there's so many people or so many men right now committing suicide that have been to these wars overseas.  It's because of the fact that they're from not the greatest childhood or education background, so they don't have the mental capability or skills to go out into the real world, so they join the military as a last resort.  They go out, they get used, they fight wars for people that they don't even know why they're fighting wars for because the majority of the wars are just for profit.  They're for major corporations to make billions and trillions of dollars.  And they come back to a society that doesn't care for them.  Let alone some of the poor buggers having wives that bang other dudes.  I've seen this with my own eyes.  I've been around a ton of military guys.  I've seen so many of my friends over the years just commit suicide, wipe themselves out.  And it's like, like friends say.  There's going to be another huge market crash coming down the pipeline.  And it's like I said in a previous video, you're soon going to be divorced, right?  So there's going to be another huge wave of men committing suicide here soon in the next market crash.  Because a lot of these guys are going to lose their homes, lose their jobs, lose their 401ks, lose all their savings.  Because they've lost all that, they'll lose the wife, they'll lose the kid, they'll lose everything.  The females will cut the freaking tether.  They'll cut the umbilical cord and you'll be left floating around out there.  All these men are going to be left just flailing around out there.  And what do they do?  Every damn time.  So... Men need to really start examining what's going on in their box, in their bubble, in their world.  Because this world, this society that we currently live in right now, it will chew you up and spit you out like a wet rag.  And if you don't have the tools, and like I said, I thank God, oh my gosh.  Do I thank God that I was given the tools to be able to get myself through this period of my life?  I really, truly do.  So I'm certainly wanting to do more videos on this subject because I see what's coming down the pipeline so clearly.  I see it so clearly.  And if I can save just a couple of men's lives in regards to helping them get through, you know, whatever it is that they're going to be going through over these next few years or life, because this stuff carries on throughout life.  Don't think it stops.  It doesn't stop.  it carries on and on and on and on and on contrary to popular belief.  That's the video.  I'm definitely going to be posting posting more videos in regards to this subject.  The other thing that I'm going to do is I'm just going to leave a link below for PayPal.  And if you guys want to donate Feel free to donate.  I'm not asking for money.  If you want to donate, you can.  If you don't want to, that's fine.  I know what it's like to have been broke and sleeping on a floor for many years, even in my car sometimes.  So yeah, like I said, life can be brutal for some of us.  So anyway, that's the video.  If you like it, give it a thumbs up.  Pound the subscribe button.  And I'll be back with more material real soon.  And I can promise you that 100%.  Cheers, guys. ",
