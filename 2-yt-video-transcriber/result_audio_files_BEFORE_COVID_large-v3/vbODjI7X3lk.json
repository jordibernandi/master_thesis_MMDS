            "text": "Jesus Christ has chosen with this quick update.  hi guys this is your sister karen gidden in jesus christ.  brothers and sisters i don't know what is going on but i am being obedient.  so just bear with me while i deliver all these prophecies or these vision concerning uh two prophets that i've been exposing since The 4th of November 2019.  I believe that God is working.  God does not want his people to perish.  So he is warning through his handmaiden and his servants.  This morning the 7th.  This morning the 7th of November 2019.  The Lord gave me an open vision, brothers and sisters.  I wasn't expecting it because I know exactly what time the vision came in.  I was about to get up because I normally get up sometime quarter to six, 6.30 or something like that.  And I woke up six o'clock this morning and I, you know what you do, you put your alarm to snooze because I think I've got about 15 or 20 minutes left and I'm going to wake up.  So the alarm went over six o'clock, snooze it a little bit for about 10 minutes or so.  Then about 15 minutes or 10 minutes to 6.30, I woke up and I said, okay, I'm going to get up in the next five minutes.  Let me just put my head to rest or something like that.  Brothers and sisters, as I turn the alarm off and I just put my head back on the pillow, I saw an open vision came in.  I was not sleeping.  My eyes were like that.  My eyes were wide open.  Brothers and sisters, in this vision, in this open vision, I saw myself in a church just like that.  When I went inside the church, a man greeted me and he said, thank you for coming, Carrie Ann.  Thank you for accepting our invitation to come to church.  And I said to him, no problem.  But in my heart, I was thinking invitation.  I'm sure nobody gave me an invitation to come to church, but that's what I was saying in my heart.  When I went inside the church, brothers and sisters, in the back seat, there was about 10 to 13 seats, row of seats, with about 10 to 13 men sitting on it.  And in the middle of the seat was Benny Hinn.  And when I looked at these men, these 13 men, including Benny Hinn, the Holy Spirit said, these are Freemasons.  including Pastor Benny.  And when the Lord said Freemason, my heart just went, it was beating so fast.  Because the first thing I think Freemasonry in the church, whoa, I know they're there, but for the Lord to just say that to me.  And God said Freemasonry.  And I walked up near to where these, call them Freemasonries, where these 13, including Benny Hinn, these 13 Freemasonries were sitting.  And in front of them was about five or six plastic chairs.  You know, your outdoor plastic chairs that you use in the summer and stuff like that.  Yeah, those five to six plastic chairs was in front of them.  And one of the guys said to me, Kerian, he called me sister.  actually, he said, Sister Kerian, you can sit wherever you want in the church.  Be comfortable.  Go and find a seat anywhere you want.  My eyes begun to scan this church.  In the middle of the church was like a circle and it had about 40 seats in a circle.  This is a church.  So there's a circle in the shape of an eye.  right in the middle of the church.  And in, in, in, so let me see if I can explain it properly.  So I had, there was an eye sign shape of an eye in the middle of the church and in the middle of the eye was another eye.  So there was like two eyes, you know, and, but all the seats together in this eye came up to 40 and I saw 40 people sitting down in the seat, 40 men, and 40 women.  and in front of this eye shape type seat was about three different rows of normal seats.  and as I began to look these seats brothers and sisters were beautiful.  I mean if you go into the church and they offer you while they didn't offer they said you can sit anywhere you want.  but these seats were made of beautiful red velvet red and blue or red and black velvet material.  very beautiful.  when you look at the seats they were absolutely gorgeous.  and so my eyes came back to Benny Hinn and well the three masonries that were sitting behind me.  then Benny Hinn spoke and you know because when I used to watch Benny Hinn he's always saying oh you know calling precious saints and precious people of God and all that you know his usual sweet talk.  And he said to me, Kerian, precious there, precious saint, why don't you go to the front and have a seat?  It's absolutely fine to go and sit in that chair up there.  And I said, in the seats up there, and I said to him, no pastor Ben-Hinn, I'm going to sit on the plastic chair.  I'm absolutely fine.  And he said to me, but look at the church.  It's got all these beautiful seats.  You will be absolutely comfortable rather than the plastic chair.  Again, I refused.  And I said, I'm absolutely fine, Pastor Bernier.  Thank you very much.  I'd rather sit on the plastic chair.  And he said, okay, dear.  Okay, precious saint.  I won't, you know, if that's your decision, that's fine.  And I said, thank you.  Then I turned my eyes and I looked in front of me, passing the I, which is the circle in the middle of the church, and the three rows.  Brothers and sisters, I looked in the pulpit.  And when I looked in the pulpit, I saw Passion Java.  And around Passion Java, there was about four men.  And they were fixing him.  I don't know, they were probably fixing his mic because he was getting ready to speak.  And we were fixing his clothes and make sure he's looking nice and brushing his clothes off, fixing his mic, fixing his hair, titivating him up for him to look good.  But one of the men, this was really, really just threw me back because remember I said Benny Hinn was sitting behind me with the three masonries, including Benny, the 13 free masonries, including Benny.  I was sitting on my plastic chair and I look in front, there was Javed.  Javed, I'm so sorry.  Passion, Java.  And these four guys were fixing him up and they were talking to him, but I couldn't hear what he was saying.  But one of the four men was Benny Hinn.  So I looked behind me and I thought, okay, that's Benny.  And I looked in front and that's Benny up there with Passion.  helping fixing him up.  and it was like in the spirit what was picking up because I couldn't hear what they were saying but in my spirit I was picking up that Benny was saying to basically saying to him you speak what I tell you to say to the congregation.  and they were like.  it was so obedient this Java guy this passion guy.  yes pastor Benny yes I will you know it was really really obedient.  And Benny Hinn was basically saying to him, you speak what I tell you to speak, be on point, you'll be absolutely fine.  And the pastor was like, yes, Pastor Benny, absolutely, absolutely.  Then I turned my eyes back and I looked back at the three masonries behind me.  And Pastor Benny Hinn began to speak.  And the Holy Spirit allowed me to see what he was wearing.  You know, Benny, he wears this, sometimes he wears this white, all white business.  But this time it's the same shape, you know, the same design.  Everything is just a color that was different.  It was more of a brownish, shimmery type clothing he was wearing.  And the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit brought up of Benny's, you know that little sign, umbrella that he's got on his clothing that he wears, like his logo or his trademark, his trademark logo that he's got.  The Holy Spirit allowed that thing, The Holy Spirit allowed that thing to came off his shirt that he was wearing, and it was dangling in front of my eyes.  I think it's a prayer sign or a bird or something, but you guys know.  You know the logo that Ben Hinn wears on his clothing.  And the Holy Spirit bought it off his clothing, bought it right in front of my eyes.  And as I was looking at these guys, these Freemasonry guys, And when I saw this logo, brothers and sisters, straight away in my spirit, I heard this is from the Marine Kingdom.  Just like that.  Just like that.  And I said in my spirit, wow, how many thousands of people have been fooled by this logo that Benny Hinn wears?  Then Benny Hinn began to speak.  Benny Hinn began to speak and this is exactly what Benny Hinn says as I was looking at this logo and just looking at everything that was going on with these Freemasonry guys.  Benny Hinn turned to one of the guys and he says, before passion, he calls him prophet, he said, before passion, before prophet passion, Jarvis speaks, make sure he is wearing this logo.  this demonic logo from the Marian kingdom that the Lord showed me before Benny Hinn says what he said.  When he said that, honestly, I mean, there wasn't much that I could do that in my heart, I think to myself, I just thought to myself, oh Lord, please don't let this guy wear this, I was saying, please don't let this passion guy wear this logo.  And when Benny Hinn told one of his Freemasonry friends, make sure, prophet, passion, Java, wear this logo or umbrella before he preaches.  And he was saying, he was adamant.  You know what he's like when he's over, you know, react sometime.  Yes, yes, he must.  He must wear this logo.  He must not preach without the logo.  He has to wear the logo.  i then turned my eyes back into the pulpit saw passion java up there with his hands like that stretch forth.  brothers and sisters and this guy by the time.  it was so quick because i don't know how this guy this freemasonry guy got to the pulpit by the time i look around he was up there with the logo thing.  oh my gosh.  so by the time i look around at passion java in the pulpit stretching his arms out the guy placed this demonic logo on his sleeve of his jacket.  and when he did that I thought to myself oh my word what have you done passion?  and then the vision just ended the vision just disappeared and I came out the vision.  When I came out of the vision, as soon as I came out of the vision, boom, boom, boom, the clock starts to alarm 6.30.  So I got up, did what to do with the kids and all of that.  And I was troubled in my spirit.  I was troubled in my spirit with this vision, this open vision that the Lord gave me.  I began to ask questions.  I said, okay, Lord, you gave me this vision.  What is going on?  What do you want me to tell your people?  Because obviously I'm not going to keep this to myself.  I said, what is it?  It was very simple.  Basically, the Holy Spirit told me that passion, Java, has been initiated into Benny Hinn's kingdom, which is a kingdom of darkness.  Now, yesterday I did a video.  I will link it in the description box.  I did a video where I said that shepherd Bushiri kills passion Java.  And in that video, in that video actually say one is from the underworld.  kingdom of darkness.  the next one is initiated into the kingdom of darkness.  now obviously when i said that i left it like that i didn't call any names.  thank you jesus but the lord allowed me to see what happened to this passion java guy.  he has no covering.  he has no spiritual.  if he thinks he's got spiritual covering is he's fooling himself.  he is deceived.  I believe what the Holy Spirit is showing me in my heart is that this passion guy started off well.  He started off well, but... You know, like everybody else, they want to get rich and famous and live in the high life and be the high top class preacher.  They can't wait on the Holy Spirit.  They have no patience to wait on the Spirit of God to take them to another level.  They can't wait.  They have to get there as quick as possible.  That's going through the window.  Jesus Christ calls them a thief by climbing through the window.  And what the Lord showed me in this vision with Benny Hinn, that Benny Hinn has initiated passion java into his kingdom.  and Benny Hinn's kingdom is not of God.  do you think that that man's kingdom is of the Holy Spirit.  I don't know what else to say to you.  I really don't know what else to say to you.  I will do a prophecy on Ben Hinn that the Lord has given to me.  I'm going to do a prophecy on him at some point.  Passion, if you're listening to me, I don't know if you watch me or whatever.  I did reach out to you, to be honest with you.  I've sent you email.  I've inboxed you on your Facebook privately.  I've inboxed your wife.  I don't know if it's your wife, but I inboxed somebody on your photograph.  I'm assuming it's your wife.  I've done what I'm supposed to do.  You have no covering.  You gave that up the moment you hooked up with Benny Hinn.  I'm sorry to say because this is what the Lord has shown me.  The Holy Spirit doesn't lie.  I don't know you.  I don't know nothing about you.  I don't watch your videos.  I don't know what your teachings are like.  I don't know what miracles you've performed.  Nothing.  Zero.  Zilph.  I am brand new into this.  Now, for the Holy Spirit to bring me Between you and Shepherd Bushiri's fight or feud or whatever it is, that is a show or act if both of you are in the spiritual realm.  The havoc that you both are creating that is affecting the people of God and God is not pleased.  You have to repent and you have to come out.  You have to come out of Benny Haynes' ministry.  You must.  You must denounce that ministry and go back to where the Lord has placed you first.  If not, you have no covering.  You have no spiritual covering.  You may have spirit guides which are demonic, which protects you.  uh people who are in freemasonry and the illuminati they are these are fallen angels.  that protects them.  that goes everywhere with them.  they call them spirit guides.  that's not the true angel but god is merciful.  he loves you and he wants you to come back.  you must repent and if you don't repent then it's going to be up to you.  but you have been initiated into benihinn's kingdom which is the kingdom of darkness.  That's what the Lord showed me.  And I have to come and I have to tell you as it is.  So I just wanted to release this vision to you, my brothers and sisters.  So God eternally bless you.  I love you all.  And I will see you soon, someday in glory, in Jesus' precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings, amen. ",
