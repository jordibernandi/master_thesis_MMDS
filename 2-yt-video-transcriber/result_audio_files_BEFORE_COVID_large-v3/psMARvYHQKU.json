            "text": "okay.  so let's do a reading on.  i've gotten this a couple times jared kushner and his sexuality.  now all soft men ain't gay and all gave me an ain't soft.  so let's see.  in cross-dressing they want to know he's the cross-dresser.  So let's see.  That's a conspiracy theory I shall entertain.  Oh, Jared.  Nine, 10.  Jared Kushner.  What does your Tinder profile say?  That's three ones.  Now, the last I did this reading, this was one of the ones at the really low sound.  So I said I would redo some and post the other one.  So here's the sum.  So the last time I got that, he's in love with his wife.  So it's not a. he's not gay, but he's not straight either.  He is I don't even know what you call it anymore.  He's not bisexual.  Well, yeah, he is bisexual.  He's not like cisgender or whatever you call it.  I don't even know.  I can't keep up with all that anymore.  I don't know.  I'm not even going to pretend to.  There's the Empress.  This is the card I get when things are a little different sexual orientation wise.  So you're part of the family.  For a pentacle.  So you do cling to the secret.  Now mind you Jarrett.  He is not.  He is in love with Ivanka.  They have a good marriage and the whole bit.  But.  For some reason.  He fears.  Being outed.  Because he had a boyfriend back in the day.  Or not, I shouldn't say boyfriend.  My boyfriend is strong.  He had a buddy.  I'll call it that.  Back in the day.  The Knight of Swords.  That's in the past.  There he is.  The Six of Cups.  That's also the past.  It's more of a longing for the past.  I think he just misses simpler days.  And there is the truth.  So there is a feminine aspect to you.  And the reason I get this is.  Anyway.  Moving on.  Then there's the sun.  The illumination is in the fear.  Then there's the fool.  You can't keep anything secret in 2019.  This is.  This is more of an innocence.  Like.  Almost to the point to where he's done nothing wrong because he wasn't with Ivanka when he had a little buddy.  He's done nothing wrong, but he feels wrong about it.  So this is not a secret as in he's trying to get away with something.  It's more of a secret of.  he doesn't want to be judged.  Happy home.  That's what he wants.  That's the desire card.  Ten of Cups is just.  I want to be happy.  being shunned, being ousted, being outed.  So this is in his future.  So again, what I say is it's not necessarily a secret thing.  It's just that he doesn't want it to come out because he feels as though people will judge him for it.  Now let's do three cards.  We'll do six cards.  We'll do three cards first.  Is he a crossdresser?  So he does like women, just for the record.  So he's not doing a pence to where, pence should not be with mommy.  Whatever that woman's name is, poor thing.  Jarrett does like women.  He just likes men too.  The world.  Four wands and the six of swords.  Does he cross dress?  I don't see that.  That's not to say it doesn't happen, but I don't see it.  I do now, but it's not.  Good Lord.  OK, so there is a. Oh, good Lord.  Oh, good lord.  If I get the Empress, I'm cutting it off right now.  Ooh, the devil.  Yeah, he... I don't know if he does it.  I don't see, like, some illumination like Ivanka knows.  But... It is something that he likes to do.  And I'm not judging because if that's what you want to do, that's what you want to do.  But because see, here's what I got.  I didn't get it here.  This is the world that didn't tell me that.  Yes, he cross dresses.  That's the four ones that didn't say it either.  Six of swords that didn't say it either.  They did give me some background of, you know, he has a world stage kind of family, whatever.  No.  What I got was a childlike enthusiasm.  So there is a want and a need and a desire to look a certain way.  Supposed to represent a child and yet the child is all Dressed to the nines.  And then I get the queen of swords.  Who has on like this wedding dress looking thing.  Then I get the secret.  And then more.  Feminine energy.  And then I get the whole.  He doesn't want to be judged.  Because.  Yeah.  Then there's the knight.  So.  Growing up.  So this is more of a. Something that's just in him.  From small.  From younger days.  And then growing up.  It turned into this.  Which is when we go back to that other card that says he doesn't want to be judged.  Because he feels as though.  Someone will tell him that it's wrong.  There is a healing to him though.  Like you can.  Express yourself in your house.  I'm pretty sure that for whatever reason your wife wouldn't care Like.  just get you some like get panties or something and then wear them.  you don't have to have a whole dress on If you just feel as though it's gonna be wrong.  What you should be more concerned about is all these laws.  you breaking asshole Seven of swords.  There is a sneakiness to him.  Well, rip out the front page. ",
