            "text": "If you're a cinephile of any sort from the anglophonic parts of North America, and you've gone shopping in one of the last remaining physical media retailers in the country, Barnes & Noble, you've probably seen this section, showing movies with exquisite cover art boasting of bonus features and crying out, \"'Collect me, collect me, for I am  Criterion.'\".  Or, if you're on the internet, you might have browsed rcriterion and seen people's collections.  Here's mine, by the way.  I admit that I'm not much of a collector.  Or maybe you've had a chuckle at the many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many fake Criterion covers floating around out there.  And you may have gone, what is Criterion?  Why is Criterion?  How does one Criterion?  What are the criteria for a Criterion?  Kyle, please explain to me why Michael Bay has two films in the Criterion collection.  The answer to that is that in the late 90s, Criterion had a slightly different mission statement, DVDs were brand new, and Michael Bay actually had some legitimate critical praise before he became shorthand for bad directing, and just because something's in the collection doesn't automatically make it a masterpiece, because sometimes sheer competence and individual style is all it takes to get on the big fancy list.  Because that's what Criterion is, really.  A big fancy list.  A list.  The list is the origin of culture.  It's part of the history of art and literature.  What does culture want?  To make infinity comprehensible.  It also wants to create order.  Not always, but often.  And how, as a human being, does one face infinity?  How does one attempt to grasp the incomprehensible?  Through lists, writes Umberto Eco.  And in the infinite ways of making a moving image, through the countless methods of moviedom, the most prestigious ever-growing list of movies, at least in an era where streaming is king and home video is increasingly becoming a collector's hobby, is Criterion.  Since 1984, the Criterion Collection has been dedicated to publishing important classic and contemporary films from around the world in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning original supplements.  No matter the medium, from Laserdisc to DVD and Blu-ray to streaming, Criterion has maintained its pioneering commitment to presenting each film as its maker would want it seen, in state-of-the-art restorations with special features designed to encourage repeated watching and deepen the viewer's appreciation of the art of film.  So goes the official Criterion mission statement.  Important, classic, and contemporary, no matter the medium, as its filmmaker would want it seen.  That is the criteria for Criterion.  I swear to God this is not just a commercial for Criterion.  I actually do have a point.  Criteria, like all cultural constructs, change over time.  Availability changes and society changes.  Now, I should state that just because a film is in the collection doesn't mean you have to like it by critical decree, obviously.  And remember that just because a film isn't in the collection doesn't mean it isn't good.  The nature of all lists is infinite, forever defined not only by their contents, but by those contents absent.  The real Criterions are as beautiful as the fake ones.  Criterion is a home video distributor like any other, one that just happens to have cornered the market on international distribution of many critically acclaimed films that otherwise wouldn't be marketable.  So instead of wenching over what is or isn't on the list, shouldn't it be wonderful knowing that films as diverse as these are considered worthy of preservation?  So, this is criterion.  Also, this is criterion.  So is this.  And so is this.  This is also criterion.  And this is criterion.  And this is criterion.  And this is criterion.  Also, this is criterion. ",
