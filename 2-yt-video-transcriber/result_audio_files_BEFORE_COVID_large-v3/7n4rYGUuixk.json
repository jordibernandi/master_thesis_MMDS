            "text": "Oh.  Say, never say, never say never Say, never say, never say never Say, never say, never say never Say, never say, never say never.  Well, Never Say Never can be taken in a lot of different ways.  Just whatever you put your mind to, just do it.  Never say you can't do it.  Whatever you put your mind to, you can do it.  But on the album, it's a song called Never.  You know, player haters or whatever they want to call them, they're really totally against my relationship.  And I tell my boyfriend, you know, if we never say never, then we can stay together forever.  Just don't ever say never.  So that's what never say never means.  People nowadays, if you're somebody in the limelight, they give you more respect.  But me as a person, I don't even feel that because the people that surround me, they don't treat me like I'm a celebrity at all.  So I think that's what keeps me down to earth.  But when I'm in the studio, They forget who I am because I don't act that way.  I don't act like the diva that people think that I should act like or people would expect me to act like.  But I'm regular.  Sometimes, you know, you have to sign a lot of autographs and stuff like that.  But I think that's cool because if they didn't ask me for my autograph, I would wonder, why aren't you asking me for my autograph?  I have my own TV show.  You know, you should watch that.  You know, I would be kind of worried about that.  So I'm thankful for all the people who are interested in knowing who I am.  Monica and I are like two peas in a pod.  We're like so cool.  And, you know, since people think that Monica and I are kind of like against each other and we're enemies, we decided to do a song where it talked about, you know, this boy is mine and you can't have him.  And, you know, just we're kind of like fighting in the song.  But every time she comes with a lick, I come with a lick.  And we're like battling in the singing whole thing.  And it's really cool.  But we're friends and we're cool.  And no matter what anybody says, we're going to.  We're going to stay tight.  My career right now is at a level where I want it to be.  It's like I have more say-so into what I'm doing.  I know what direction I want to take myself.  I want to go into a more mature level.  And also, I want people to know that I'm dedicated to what I'm doing.  I love doing what I do.  When people see me, I want people to think, oh, she's doing it because she loves it.  Not that that didn't come across before, but I just want to make sure that that's what's coming across.  And I'm happy with the way my career is going right now. ",
