            "text": "The Green New Deal is basically a plan for how the US can tackle Earth's climate crisis while protecting us against most of its devastating economic impacts.  It was created by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey after the UN issued an extensive report showing that we have about 12 years to prevent the worst consequences of climate change, which include trillions of dollars worth of damage to the global economy.  The Green New Deal lays out a 10-year mobilization plan with essentially 10 main goals that are meant to be a starting point for a larger conversation.  Because of this, it is purposely big on vision and short on specifics.  Here's a quick recap of those 10 goals.  Goal number one, zero emissions.  Since carbon emissions are the main culprit when it comes to our climate crisis, the Green New Deal proposes meeting 100% of our power demand through clean, sustainable, and renewable resources.  Solar and wind power are already cheaper than fossil fuels, so this goal is probably one of the easiest to accomplish.  Goal number two, training and resources.  Because a highly educated population will be better equipped to adapt to the effects of climate change, the Green New Deal proposes that we provide high quality training and higher education to all Americans.  A plan like free college would go a long way towards meeting this goal.  Goal number three, economic security.  The Green New Deal proposes that we provide all Americans with high quality and affordable healthcare, housing, food, and access to clean air, clean water, and natural spaces.  How we accomplish this will mean introducing many new laws as well as strengthening existing environmental protections.  Goal number four, jobs with livable wages.  Because economic uncertainty will intensify more and more as the climate crisis grows, the Green New Deal proposes job guarantees with family-sustaining wages that include medical leaves, paid vacations, and retirement security.  Goal number five, infrastructure.  Because extreme weather events will continue to threaten our roads, bridges, and existing infrastructure, the Green New Deal proposes that we invest heavily into these in the most carbon neutral way possible with the best tools technology will allow.  Goal number six, smart energy grids.  The Green New Deal proposes upgrading our energy grid to more energy efficient systems while also helping to make electricity more affordable.  Goal number seven, building upgrades.  Since Americans spend most of their lives in the workplace, the Green New Deal proposes upgrading our buildings to not only be more energy efficient, but also to create new buildings with high marks in durability, safety, water efficiency, and affordability.  Goal number eight, transportation upgrades.  The Green New Deal proposes investments in these three main areas.  zero-emission vehicles, public transportation that is clean, affordable, and accessible, and high-speed rail throughout the country.  Goal number nine, clean manufacturing.  Because manufacturing industries are some of the worst polluters, the Green New Deal proposes removing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and related industries as much as it's technologically feasible.  Goal number 10, clean agriculture.  Since the agricultural sector is a major polluter and source of greenhouse gases, the Green New Deal proposes working with farmers and ranchers to eliminate emissions also as much as it's technologically feasible.  It's unlikely that we'll accomplish everything in this proposal, but a consensus of climate scientists agree that the stakes are too high not to try.  So what can you do?  The UN's 12 year window is obviously a very short amount of time.  So a sense of urgency is not only appropriate, it's necessary.  Only 100 global companies are responsible for 71% of total carbon emissions.  China's coal company alone accounts for 14% of global emissions.  It can no longer be acceptable to let these companies poison the ecosystems that we depend on.  If we want our grandchildren to survive on Earth, we have a responsibility to act now.  Peace. ",
