            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  This is Kiwi and I'm back with another video.  Anyway, I did actually have a video done for you guys last week, but I wasn't happy with it.  I really, really wasn't.  It wasn't getting into the nitty-gritty of this subject.  And so what I'm going to be talking about is how to get your life back on track, like how to start going down the actual, you know, your God-given natural path in life, you know.  I know a lot of you are going to have a hard time believing this, but believe it or not, we're actually all born onto this world with an actual path that we need to be going down.  That's where in the Bible or religious teachings, they talk about following God's will or performing God's will on this planet.  It's not walking around being this holier-than-thou... kind of person.  It's going down your natural path in life.  I'm going to do a video about when I died and when I left my body, crossed over, experienced the other side, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What I learned out of that experience is that we all have a God-given natural path that we need to go down.  And every human being on this planet has a path that they need to be going down.  And believe it or not, you can do no wrong.  I know that seems like a pretty hard thing to comprehend or understand.  However... You, as an individual, you have this life's journey that you need to go down.  You're going down it right now, whether you care to admit it at all or not.  It doesn't matter what you're doing in your life right now.  You are learning.  You are waking up.  You are experiencing what it is that you need to be experiencing.  However, a lot of us... are struggling, a lot of us are angry, a lot of us are frustrated, a lot of us are unhappy, a lot of us are just damn straight miserable.  And it's because of what I've spoken about in the previous videos about how you've been taught to go down a specific path and just to, you know, get on a hamster wheel and do what society wants you to do, what the what the The system, societal beliefs, ideologies, indoctrinations, whatever it is, what they want you doing to keep you running on the hamster wheel of life.  Now, the majority of the people in the self-help industry, all the voodoo guru people and everything like that, they're all trying to sell you a quick fix, okay?  If you follow these 12 rules on life, you're gonna suddenly be living a full, prosperous, solid life.  or what have you.  If you follow Tony Robbins, DVD series you're gonna have this amazing life of wealth and abundance and everything else.  or if you Listen to fucking Oprah Winfrey and all her frickin mojo frickin voodoo guru stuff You're gonna have a life like Oprah Winfrey and it's you know.  I'll tell you how frickin solidly grounded Oprah Winfrey is.  you take all her money from her and all her material belongings and all that sort of stuff and you will see the real Oprah Winfrey and it won't be fucking pretty.  and And it would be the same with Tony Robbins.  It would be the same with Dr.  Jordan Peterson.  It would be the same with the majority of those people that are trying to get you to buy into this quick fix that's going to get you going in the chosen life that you need to be living full of abundance and wealth and happiness and joy.  And you can get everything you ever possibly want.  Well, guess what?  I got everything I could ever possibly want and I was fucking miserable.  Miserable.  I've never been so unhappy in my entire life.  I had the beautiful home.  I had the blonde with the big boobs.  I had the nice cars.  I built my own race car.  I had been on TV.  I had, at certain points in my life, I had a ton of money and I was continually unhappy.  And it was because I was constantly filling this huge void, this hole in my soul.  And the more I was trying to take all this different stuff to make myself happy, the more miserable I became.  And it was because I brought into the quick fix.  If I hop on a plane and leave New Zealand and fly to America, the land of cream and honey and milk and sugar and the American dollar bill, I will be happy.  Wasn't fucking happy wasn't happy in any way shape or form.  So after going through a divorce after losing everything after experiencing all sorts of Psychological mental and physical trauma in my life while I was in the United States.  I started to realize that my life was a complete and utter lie, so I've.  My journey really started in 2003, 2004 when I moved my wife and my daughter out of the house in Thousand Oaks.  Because it was just too much bullshit.  Dealing with my wife was just too much.  I could not make her happy.  And I started to realize if I can't make her happy, then I need to start making myself happy.  And I started on that journey.  And these are the things that I did that got me on my natural God-given path in life.  Now, there's no quick fix.  There's no quick... Fingers aren't working right now.  There's no quick fix.  There's no quick pill that's going to take you from this path, this path of misery, frustration, anger... There's nothing that's going to take you from this path and suddenly throw you over onto your next path.  Not going to happen.  The people that are selling you that are sending you off down into the abyss.  When you head off into the abyss, it makes your life even worse.  100%.  That's what happened to me when I hopped on a plane and flew to the United States.  I was heading off into the abyss.  I had no clue what I was getting into, and man, did it.  Frickin', it was unbelievable.  Now, some people are cut out to head off into the abyss.  The majority of the population isn't able to deal with heading off into the abyss.  That's all there is to it.  So... What I ended up having to do was, obviously, the first thing that I did was I actually moved my ex-wife, my now ex-wife, out of the house that we had.  And that's what really started the wheels turning.  The next thing that happened was I lost my business.  I'd merged my business with another company in Simi Valley, and I lost that business in a hostile takeover.  Then I lost the house.  Because I didn't have the money.  And then I started to lose myself.  July of 2004, I lost myself.  And I spent the next four to five years doing serious, serious, serious, serious deep shadow work.  Like major shadow work.  Bringing my head and my heart together.  Bringing them into unison with each other.  To actually start working.  However... That's a whole other subject.  Now, what I didn't realize I was doing at the time was I was backing up.  When people are telling you that you can go from this path to this path through the abyss, they're full of shit.  You need to start backing up.  And when you start backing up, you actually start... having to go inside of yourself.  You have to start literally healing what is inside of you.  You have to start healing where the anger and the rage and the misinformation and the ideologies and all the indoctrination, you have to start confronting that stuff.  And it takes a huge amount of time.  I mean, I'll give you a good, here's a good example, okay?  This is a perfect analogy, okay?  Up behind the house here, up behind where I live, just up there is a road, okay?  Now the road that I take every day into Auckland is up over that hill, all right?  Now, what these people in the self-help industry are telling you, let's say that road over there is the wrong path that you're going down.  What they're telling you is you can suddenly get off that road and then send you through the abyss.  You gotta go down this gully, into the bush, through a river, then up the other side of the hill, down another gully, and you finally get to your path, right?  Now, you don't know what's down there.  That's heading out into a part of the world you might not know anything about.  So in real life, you have to get back on the path and you've got to start backing up.  And you've got to get to that junction where you took the wrong turn in life, where you ended up going down the wrong path in life.  That is when you can actually look at the path that you should have been taking and you can start down that road That will actually get you going in the direction that you you need to be going.  However These individuals they they don't tell you that stuff.  They don't explain that stuff to you.  So It takes time it takes a huge amount of time and One of the other things that I started to do is I did that shadow work.  And like I said, I'll do a video on that stuff.  Actually, we'll most probably end up doing a number of videos on that stuff.  Then what happened was I started to tap out as far as the negative people in my life.  I started to, I moved out of the house that I was renting in Camarillo, California.  I started to get rid of a lot of the materialism.  Materialism weighs you down.  The cottage that I live in now has the fundamental basics that I need in life, nothing else.  and that's why it was so easy for me to leave Los Angeles and move back to New Zealand, because I didn't have all that weight, I didn't have all that baggage, I didn't have all that crap that was weighing me down.  I could basically take my cash money, pack my bag, And I was off.  The only thing I had to ship out here was my tools and a few valuable things.  And it was a very small wooden crate.  And anyway, so yeah, I moved out of the house that I was living in, renting, got rid of a shit ton of furniture, and I actually moved into my business.  I had two shops, back to back.  The back shop was the shop that I did my work out of, and then the front shop was the shop that I was actually... Set up as a man cave.  now as I've mentioned in previous videos my landlord pulled a fast one on me and He actually kicked me out of the unit and that's a whole nother story.  I'm not gonna get into that right now.  What happened though was that was when the real change started to happen in my life.  I've done everything.  I've been backing up moving the wife out of the house and I lost my first business.  I did my shadow work.  I moved out of the house that I was renting.  I started to cut back on my materialism.  Got rid of a lot of my furnishings.  A lot of stuff that I didn't need in life.  It was just a waste of time and money and energy having this stuff.  The big gorilla, the huge gorilla that was sitting on my shoulders was this belief and this ideology in my head, this idea that I had to be a successful businessman, that if I wasn't this specific individual, I wasn't going to be successful in life, I was going to be a loser,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.  So after four attempts... of starting a business, building it up, losing it.  After the fourth time, I was like, all right, it's pretty obvious that I'm not meant to be a businessman.  Because every business, it all happened in the same amount of timeframe.  So I was like, fine.  And even though I wanted to literally murder my landlord for what he did to me, because I was homeless for two months, okay?  What I did was I put good energy out there.  I put really good energy out there.  I got him a tenant.  Even though this landlord had fucked me over something fierce, I got him a tenant to sign a five-year $120,000 lease with the guy.  And what that did was that put a huge amount of good energy back into that, a lot of the negative that had been going on over here.  And once I got on that gorilla off my shoulders and I finally stepped back and I was like, oh my God, that is the path.  There it is.  It's wide open.  It's right there.  And I was literally able to start going down my God-given, heart, soul, chosen, whatever you want to call it, path in life.  And what a change it's made in my world.  I cannot get over it.  So if some of you guys are lost, if you're feeling miserable, depressed, full of anger, hatred to the world, your life sucks, everything like that.  You need to understand, if you're going to start wanting to back up, it's going to take time.  This journey for me started in 2003, August of 2003, when I moved my ex-wife out of the house.  And it took me 16 years.  16 years.  I will say, though... There was a period where I couldn't leave my daughter.  I could have actually gone down this chosen path.  I could have been going down my natural path in life.  It would have been about 2005, 2004.  Because I had job opportunities in NASCAR.  I could have gotten a job at Joe Gibbs Motorsports working in the fabrication department there, but I couldn't leave my daughter behind.  So a lot of the pain and a lot of the misery and a lot of the anguish that I had to go through was having to stay in one area to make sure my daughter was safe, to make sure she was good.  And there's a whole reason behind that.  And I'm not going to, you know, revolves around a lot of other stuff.  The joy of that is she's an amazing woman.  She has turned into somebody that I'm just absolutely humbled by.  It's just absolutely incredible seeing how well that person is doing.  Just a really, really, really good human being.  An incredibly good human being.  So a lot of that pain, a lot of that misery, it paid off.  It paid off in having an amazing child, an amazing daughter that's going to be a really worthwhile member of society.  Plus I learned a lot.  I learned a huge amount of stuff.  Actually a lot of stuff I wish I really didn't know.  But those were the positives that came out of that.  However, now that I'm actually going down this path, I'm actually able to share this knowledge with you, the viewers, the subscribers, and I'm happy.  You know, happiness is... People are always looking for happiness.  They're always seeking happiness.  And happiness is literally a state of mind.  And when you find your natural God-given path in life, once you've removed all this drama, negative crap, and everything else out of your life, you can actually start going down, you know, a pretty amazing path that... Is incredibly beneficial to you.  And when life becomes beneficial to you.  You become beneficial to the people around you.  You find your place in society.  You find... you know, who you are, what you are, what you need to be doing, and everything behind why you need to be doing it.  Everything becomes this natural, it just feels so natural.  And it's because, at the end of the day, your heart, your soul, is literally the captain of this human body.  This human body is just a vessel.  And you have to get your mind and your heart brought together.  You have to get these two working together.  And when you get them working together, it's incredible the journey that you can go down.  And we'll be doing a lot more, going to be doing a lot more on this subject.  So anyway, if that's helped you out in any way, shape or form, give it a thumbs up, pound the subscribe button.  Talk to you guys soon.  Cheers. ",
