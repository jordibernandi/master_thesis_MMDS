Tony opened the debate by making these claims, which I listed in my opening response.  And then I provided clear evidence that disproved each and every one, either by checking Tony's sources and how he misread them, or showing things that he claimed didn't exist, or challenging his misquotes by asking for video clips that he couldn't provide, or contradicting his claims with actual facts and figures.  Which is how science debates are supposed to work.  After only three rounds of this, Tony refused to continue.  So I'm delighted to see that eight months on, he's finally rejoined the debate.  A week before I was due to fly home, in fact, so he's just in time.  I got back a couple of days ago, so I can now post my response.  So let's take a look at his latest rebuttal. ",

So let's go with what I actually said, rather than what Tony wishes I'd said.  I said that regular orbital cycles cause a small change in insulation, and this starts a process called positive feedback, causing strong warming or cooling.  That again is not my theory, it's the conclusion of scientific research that I've cited.  I'm happy with that being characterised as a tiny nudge, as long as it's understood that the tiny nudge is a change in insulation.  But I never said that a tiny nudge stops this process.  As I explained, warming or cooling is stopped because feedback is less than one, so positive feedback gets weaker and weaker, until finally the amount of energy leaving the Earth equals the amount coming in.

I used this very simple illustration in one of my videos to explain the principle of positive feedback using the example of a balance with a rolling weight.  In this example, positive feedback brings the plank crashing to the ground because the feedback is greater than one.  In other words, even after the initial forcing stops, the tilting continues and accelerates.  In the example of feedback in glacial cycles, I explained that once the initial forcing stops, positive feedback doesn't get faster and faster and lead to runaway warming because feedback is less than one.  I can list the differences very clearly in this graphic, so hopefully they won't get mixed up again in Tony's next rebuttal. ",

And I don't want people to believe a strong force stops this non-existent runaway feedback.  None of this nonsense about forces stopping runaway feedback and nudges stopping ice ages is anywhere in the scientific literature or in my videos.  I'm obviously going to have to explain this again, but this time I'll write it down.  Firstly, changes in orbital cycles cause changes in insulation, increasing warming in a crucial part of the Earth.  This triggers feedbacks that amplify the warming.  Because the Earth's climate feedback is less than one, the feedback effect gets less and less over time.  Think of an echo that bounces around a canyon.  The increase in the Earth's temperature therefore continues at a smaller and smaller rate until the amount of energy leaving the Earth equals the amount coming in.  The Earth then stabilizes at this new higher temperature called the equilibrium temperature.  It's now in an interglacial.  It remains in the interglacial state for thousands of years until orbital cycles change insulation in the opposite direction, cooling the Earth, amplified by positive feedback, and the Earth enters another glacial period.

I say that my explanation of what causes glaciations and the figures I gave for methane are an accurate reporting of the science.  You say they aren't.  So all we have to do is check the science journals.  Since I've been willing to answer all your questions, let's nail you down on my questions.  Do you now understand the difference between a teeter-totter and a glacial cycle?  If you disagree with any of them, please say which ones you disagree with and why.  I've explained during this debate how the Earth's climate feedback systems diminish once the initial forcing stops until outgoing radiation matches incoming radiation and the Earth stabilizes at a new equilibrium temperature.  This is what the science says, so have I misrepresented the science, and if so, how?  Do you disagree with the figures I gave for the half-life of methane, methane's global warming potential, and the changes in atmospheric methane concentration over the last 40 years?  If so, please give what you think are the correct figures and cite your sources, just as I've done.  If it's time-consuming for you to make videos and you just prefer to talk into a camera and give your information and your sources verbally, that's fine.  You say you'd rather give your presentation live.  That's fine too.  Please do it live.  Let everyone know what time you're going to give your rebuttal and everyone can watch it live.  But I'm still going to fact-check your claims however you present them, because there's no escaping fact-checking in a science debate.  As we've seen, you make mistakes.  I'm happy to put this down to a faulty memory or a misreading of the scientific studies you sometimes cite, which are the kind of errors we all make.  But that's why I fact-check all your claims, and I expect you to fact-check mine.  See if you can find something I've got wrong.  We're not here just to shout at each other, talk past each other, throw insults and make things up as we go along.  Science debates aren't about declaring yourself the winner, as you put it in yet another made-up quote, Tony.  It's about establishing who's got his facts right and who's wrong.  Getting to the truth makes both of us winners.  And presenting evidence to support an assertion or disprove someone's spurious claim isn't digging in heels.  It's how we separate fact from fiction.  Of course, you can make your next rebuttal another round of personal insults if you really want to, but I think most people would like to see a debate where we bring facts and figures to the table, compare them, cite our sources and fact-check to get to the bottom of who's right and who's wrong.
