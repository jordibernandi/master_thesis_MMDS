            "text": "what's up guys?  it's young man's daily red pill.  in today's video i'm going to be talking about five reasons why young men are going to start taking the red pill and going their own way starting in 2020 and continuing on.  the first reason why is these women are much more promiscuous especially now in 2020?  guys?  it's gone off the hook.  a lot of these women their body counts are in the high 50s 60s.  Actually, when I was in junior college a couple years ago, I was talking to one of the women's basketball players and out of nowhere she brought up to me her body count.  Guys, it was like 67.  So if she's just a basketball player and she wasn't even all that good looking, imagine some of these good looking chicks and their body counts and how high they must be, guys.  These women are out here doing crazy things, sucking dick in the parking lot.  They're exposed to sexual nature at a very early age, starting at around 12 to 13 years old nowadays.  And it's really quite sad because a lot of these women, they have to offer virtue, but they give it away to all these men before they can settle down with the right man for them.  The second reason is social media is encouraging these women to be promiscuous and to act a certain type of way, act as though they are better than men and act as if we should be worshipping these women when in fact we should be chasing our purpose and working on ourselves so that she can chase us.  And we should never have to worry about chasing a woman.  You should always be focused on your own goals and your aspirations for life.  Because in the end, having her or having a certain woman that you think is good for you doesn't matter in the end.  It doesn't.  It doesn't matter at all.  At the end of the day, this is all programmed in your brain just to keep the economy going, guys.  If we don't have simps spending money The economy actually fails.  I'm not even joking with you guys.  The economy freaking fails.  If we don't have guys spending money, these simps that want to spend money on women, the economy does not work.  Social media also gives women access to so many men at once, guys.  You can turn on your range, your miles of radius when you swipe to 50 to 500.  I don't even know, maybe to a thousand now, but you can basically be swiping a match with someone in a different state, guys.  Your woman could do this to you and you wouldn't even know it because the guy that she's messaging and talking to will never tell you.  But if it's in reverse and you go out and you talk to a woman on a social media app and this woman finds out you have a girlfriend at home, Best believe, best believe that she is going to expose your ass and tell your girlfriend.  Guys, it doesn't work like, it's not, there's no equality in this.  There's no equality in this.  You know, the way society is right now, it's just so fucked up.  That shit happens all the time.  She has access to many, many men and men that you will never even know about.  Men from different states, different locations.  Men that have probably come over when you've gone to work.  Men that have come over when you went to the gym late at night or you were working that extra overtime, whatever you were doing.  Guys, these women are nuts.  These women are disgusting.  These women will cheat on you and feel not even bad about it.  They will do these things out of spite and just out of the feeling inside of their hearts at that very moment.  Disregarding all of the emotions and how you made her feel because these women live by day to day and they don't operate in the same way that we do.  We operate by logic.  These women operate in their emotions.  So if she feels a certain way one day, hell, she might feel different an hour later and sleep with that guy next door.  Number three, why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?  Like I said earlier, you have access to more women.  These women are more promiscuous, my first two points.  So why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?  If you don't know what that means, I don't know what to tell you, but I'll explain it briefly right now.  Why would you cuff a chick or get in a relationship with her, a monogamous relationship, when you're having sex with her consistently, hopefully, and she is only going to benefit from you getting a relationship.  Why buy the milk when you can get the cow for free, man?  You can be smashing these broads for free.  Why would you tie down something that you can get for free and that she's giving away and she's given away to all these men in the past?  I don't understand why you would want to tie that down and claim a woman that has been promiscuous and has access to all these men on social media.  It doesn't make sense to me.  Don't be that guy that gets caught with one of these sluts.  Reason number four, we as young men are able to see how female nature operates When we look at our elders, and when I mean elders, I mean elder men in our family or guys that are close to us.  Maybe you have older friends that have already been married and divorced.  We see how females operate.  We know female nature.  We completely understand it now.  Our eyes have been opened.  If you've taken the red pill.  And I truly believe in 2020, more and more men will start taking the red pill and truly realize their self-value and their worth.  And they will not let these women manipulate them into getting married.  Why would you do that?  Why would you get married?  I don't understand why you would get married.  There's no, the only reason you would get married is to pay for sex.  And that's honestly what I could say.  You want a consistent meat hole to dig out every single night and eventually she's gonna wanna stop giving you that meat hole and you're gonna have to start using your hand.  maybe that leads to you cheating down the line and your ass is getting caught and you lose half your assets and your family disgraces you because she lies on you.  you might even go to jail because she says she raped you raped her.  all these all these crazy things can happen.  guys don't be caught in that.  do not get caught in that only a foolish man would decide to get married.  reason number five these women are much more masculine.  they're much more masculine nowadays And the reason they are is because they have these women in their ears, these elder women in their ears, like their mothers, their aunties, their cousins, all telling these women about game and telling them how they can treat men a certain type of way, treat them disrespectfully, walk all over these men, and we will still come back and we will still provide for them.  We will still take care of them.  Well, that shit stops in 2020.  That shit stops.  We're no longer taking care of you.  We're no longer providing.  What do you provide to us besides a meatball, really?  What do you provide to us?  Are you helping our businesses?  Are you helping us further our education?  Are you helping us with any goals we have, any aspirations, any desires?  Are you helping build a kingdom that we've already created?  If not, we don't need you in our lives.  And that's what we men have realized in 2020, starting now.  I work at a restaurant, and a lot of times you see these couples walk in.  The guy doesn't know what the hell he's doing.  He's walking behind his wife with the kids and both his arms.  Looks hella miserable, first of all.  Looks out of, like, looks so fucking miserable.  Like, if you look at these guys, they look like they don't even want to live anymore.  And I'm not even joking, guys.  Just a grim look on their face.  Anyways, they have two kids in their hands right behind the wife.  Wife is totally fucking grabs their balls by the fucking, like this, just grabs them, rips them out.  Fucking puts it on her own clit.  And she says... We're taking this table outside.  He's like, I don't want to sit outside.  She's like, we're sitting outside.  We need two high chairs.  We need crayons.  Like, get this shit done, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They're always fucking bossing these guys around, these beta male guys.  I'm tired of seeing that shit.  Us men are tired of seeing it.  And we're starting to wake up to that.  And we're tired of women bossing us around and acting masculine.  We want a feminine woman that listens to us and that cooks, cleans, does what she's supposed to do, shuts the fuck up.  shuts the fuck up and not everything revolves around her.  That's what we want in 2020.  We as young men simply don't want any of these five characteristics.  If you agreed with anything that I said, drop a like on the video, comment, subscribe.
