I'm here today with Dr.  Kenneth Stoller, medical doctor from Santa Rosa, California, the hyperbaric oxygen therapy doctor and author of Incurable Me.  So today we're going to be talking about the 5G Wi-Fi takeover, cell towers popping up everywhere.  So doc, I just wanted to give you a report.  There's a mom in my area that was looking for a daycare and she said she was going to, you know, put her kid in a daycare right down the road.  And I said the daycare right by the cell tower.  And she goes, wait, what?  And she said, I just wanted to thank you for telling me about that.  Cause she was going to put her kid there all day.  And I realized that these towers are popping up in residential zones.  They're right behind high schools, right behind houses.  And we've kind of been surrounded by the kill grid. ",

I'm in Tampa Bay, Florida, and people were saying, well, don't you already have 5G?  Honestly, I really don't know.  But what I do know is there's these towers that are three tiers.  There's racks of these white cell phone things.  But when I go down to the beach in St.  Petersburg, Treasure Island, on top of the condos, they're mounting these things on top of the building.  So even if I wanted to move, I have to think strategically because I want to just run off into the country and get out of the city.  So I'm just trying to bring awareness to this issue.  And, you know, it's just like, what do we do?  Like with the zoning thing, if we have residential zones and we have people that are working, even in like, what do you call it?  Um, they rent out commercial like a workspace to people.  i mean there's still towers.  there's people that are working there all day. ",

What are we supposed to do?  I guess then you have to complain on the federal level that these things shouldn't be installed without adequate safety testing.

Where your parents live, I mean, even mobile home communities where land is divided up with weird easements and the county owns places, like the county where they have our water tanks, they're starting to mount these things on there, like I mentioned before.

It's courting disaster.  So just because we can do something doesn't mean we should do it.  Yeah, you can build a nuclear power plant on a subduction zone, but is that a good idea to do?
