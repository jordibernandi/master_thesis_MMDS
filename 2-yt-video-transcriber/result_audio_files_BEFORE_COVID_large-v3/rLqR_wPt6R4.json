            "text": "We're facing the biggest crisis humanity has ever encountered.  Climate breakdown, ecological breakdown, earth systems breakdown, all happening in front of our eyes.  The scale and the speed of it just defies belief.  It's so grave and so big.  And it's perfectly clear that the existing political system and economic system is not fit for purpose.  Business as usual, politics as usual, is not going to get us out of this horrendous mess.  We need system change.  And what that requires, as history shows, is massive non-violent civil disobedience.  We need to create the biggest movements there have ever been to confront the biggest crisis there has ever been.  Let's make these huge and let's change the world. ",
