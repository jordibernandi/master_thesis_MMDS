Now for those of you who don't know, Globusters are a team of self-proclaimed scientific experts who claim to be able to prove that the Earth isn't actually a spinning ball.  Now last Sunday I had the pleasure of watching them try and take down one of my videos that I've linked in the description which explains why the Earth can have an atmosphere next to the vacuum of space.

Now, in this video, we're going to look at just how academically weak the Globebusters team actually are, as they make one calamitous error after another as they try and go through my video.  But before we start that, I have to explain one simple point.  Well, it's simple to you and me, not so simple to the Globebusters team.  When we're talking about pressure, if I want to measure the pressure, or gas pressure, right here, right in this space here, if I'm going to measure that, then I need something in that area for the gas particles to bounce off, because when a particle bounces off something, there's a change in momentum, and that provides the force.  Now, if I have something here, it's going to experience the pressure, and it'll experience at sea level a pressure of about 14.7 psi.  Now, if I take it out of this particular area here, it's no longer experiencing that pressure.  Sure, we get gas particles bouncing off each other, but we're not going to measure the pressure there until we take an object and we put it in that space to feel the pressure.  The fact that I've got walls in the room around this really are absolutely secondary to the fact that I'm putting a ball here, or I'm not putting a ball there, or I'm putting a ball here, or I'm not.  It's not a difficult concept.  Let's see how the Globusters team deal with that.  So I'm going to start with what is pressure.  So, pressure is defined as the force per unit area.  So in other words, I have to have a force upon an area.  And with gas pressure, this is my living room and these are the... ",

They are claiming that gas particles don't strike off a surface and bounce off.  They seem to think that gas pressure is caused by the gas lazily lying on top of an object.  And it gets worse.  Danny, that's the point.  Is he kind of implying here that There's a kind of Schrodinger's cat kind of function to the atmosphere.  We've not got the balloon in there or a probe in there.  There's no atmosphere.  No, I'm not saying anything of the sort.  One more time, very quickly for the children watching.  If I take a ball and I put it here, gas particles bounce off it.  As they bounce off it, there's a change in momentum which provides a force.  Now, the total force over the total area will give me the pressure that I can measure.  If I take that object out.  then I now no longer have an object experiencing that, so I can't measure the pressure.  The gas particles are just bouncing off themselves.  It's not difficult.  This whole Schrodinger's cap and does the atmosphere exist or not is ludicrous.  And you'd think that the other scientific experts on the panel would say, well, hang on, no, he's not saying that.  That is ludicrous.  But they don't. ",

In that, he pretty much did more harm to flat Earth than I ever could by proving that the Earth actually rotates.  It's hilarious.  You want to go and watch it.  Anyway, back to this.  Our next scientific genius, Sleeping Warrior, Anthony Riley, then watches a video by somebody called Mick West.  Now, Mick West does a computer simulation.  I've linked his video in the description.  He does a computer simulation where he shows the Earth.  And how the Earth's gravitational pull causes the atmosphere and causes a gradient in pressure in the atmosphere.  However, Sleeping Warrior completely misunderstands what that video is.  You know what?  Just have a listen.  Just substitute the word ball for balloon and have a laugh. ",

No, they go on to say this.  Does he have experimental evidence for this animation or this is merely a thought experiment?  or is this like data that's mapped out into the animation?

There is nobody alive that thinks that a ball here or a balloon or a big metal ball here is going to create its own mini atmosphere around it when the Earth... with such a ginormous mass in comparison, is right below it.  That is just not what the heliocentric model says.  So either you can't understand the extremely simple concept that the Earth is much, much, much, much, much, much bigger than a ball, or you're being deliberately dishonest.

You were right about the fact that I was going to make a video making fun of the things you said, but when you say the things you say, I can't help it.  I really can't.  Please keep making more videos.  It's brilliant.  I haven't drawn the dots on the whiteboard that you said, so just for you, Jaron, so you can be right about something.  There you go, mate.  I might see you in part two.  Bye-bye. ",
