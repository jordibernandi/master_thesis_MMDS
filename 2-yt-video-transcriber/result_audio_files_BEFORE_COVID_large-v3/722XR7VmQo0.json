I was really upset watching it and it takes a lot for me to get upset.  I don't really get triggered or nothing like that.  But Don Lemon, I expect him to do pretty nasty things on CNN just by being an angry person, an angry, demented liberal.  But this right here, Talking down to an elderly man, number one, but number two, a reverend.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Don Lemon.  I get that you are a liberal, you hate Trump, but come on.  At a certain point, have respect for average, everyday people.  Try to make a difference.  This man says, I want to help the black community.  I want what's best for the black community and all people in America, especially poor people.  And you just want to disrespect that and down that.  It was crazy, but what can I expect from a guy like Don Lemon?  He's just putting his own personal opinion and feelings in there, talking about gay marriage.  That directly affects Don Lemon.  I'm not sure if he's married to his boyfriend or not, but that's a different story.  And for now, I digress.  My whole point here is that he is inserting his personal political points of view onto CNN.  If you want to be a real news network CNN, don't have guys like Don Lemon on there.  And if you're going to have him on there, have him on the short leash.  Don't just let him say whatever he wants to say.  I mean, that shouldn't be how we go forward.  If you want to do that, Don Lemon, have your own network, become a YouTuber like I am, and then you have more freedom.  But you represent CNN, people like yourself and others on the network like little Brian Stelter.  You are degrading.  the once great network into nothing and when it's all said and done after trump.  after all the political division you guys are going to be left like a relic from the past.  so that's pretty much all i got.  what say you?  do you think that i'm correct in my assertion of don lemon or am i incorrect?  if you think either way please let me know why.  in the comments below you know why i think the way i do.  That was crazy, even for a Don Lemon, an elderly man, a reverend, a guy that's a faith leader who was meeting with other faith leaders to try to make a difference.  You want to just downplay that, disrespect that.  I was really not feeling that at all, which is, like I said before, not a surprise for me coming from CNN, a once great network that has been reduced to absolute nothingness.  absurdity.  but whatever your comments are please let me know in the comments below.  and that's all i gotta say for this video.  if you like what you heard please comment rate share and subscribe peace.
