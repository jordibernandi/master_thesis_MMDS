This is our lady, our fruit seller, and she's showing me how to balance a fruit on her head which is traditional.  But I wanted to show you some other elements of African life.  So I'm going to show you some clips of me going to the dentist.  to get my teeth done, and also going to the bank, going shopping.  Seth goes to Binnie's, a great shop here, and we go to a petrol station, and I'll explain and break down the costs.  So just for even, just some fruit.  You've got the fruit for me.  This will cost you 65 dollars.  65 dollars for all of that is just over a pound.  So you get value for money here.  You get lots more fruit.  I'm going to add to it and get lots more for my dollars.  So basically, I explained that petrol was slightly cheaper here.  I also explained that life here is much easier and more cost effective here.  You pay for your electricity.  That's what people wanted to ask me.  You pay as you go according to your consumption.  And also the same with water.  So she has to go.  She has to go and sell these fruit now.  So I just want to say, Blacksit family, she's going to help you buy more now.  Keep watching all these clips about life.  And I'll meet you on the other side. ",

And these are Gambian black businesses.  So this is me.  Go back to the car.  And that's the gym.  You can see people training in there.  Hey, hi.  Sorry.

People were asking me about the cost of living and so I wanted to really integrate some of the clips that you've just seen in with the budget and you've seen our home.  You've obviously seen other clips of us putting in petrol and so on.  So what I've done is just shown you a site budget of how much it costs.  So like a house rent, I've done it in pounds because obviously English was the currency, sorry, British sterling was a currency that we're familiar with rather than the lattice, which you might not be familiar with.  So yeah, 480 pounds to rent this house for the month.  Dentists have a filling is 32 pounds.  Full tank of petrol was \u00a360.  Water for the month was \u00a316.  Now wet power was \u00a366.  But you bear in mind that we do have quite a large house.  Six bedrooms.  No, yes, no.  Yeah, six bedrooms.  Yeah, five bathrooms and, you know, a lot of areas.  So also staff.  You can have staff and you pay them about \u00a325 a month.  for part-time staff.  Bearing in mind that the DeLasse's is different to your currency, so it might sound low, but your money goes far here.  And also full-time staff, 25 to 50 a month, and that's for a driver and a helper if you want one.  Internet service, depending on the speed or the width band, can be anything from 10 pounds to 30 pounds, depending on how many people will be using it.  And shopping per month works out about 150 pounds.  And that doesn't include eating out.  We don't eat out as often as we used to, simply because of the fact that we've been working really hard on building our house.  So, but when we do eat out, the average for chicken meal is about 200 Alassi, so probably you're looking at about 152 pounds. ",

So we've shown you some bits, a little bit of culture, a little bit of nightlife, a little bit of practicality, things that we do and also of course that all-important budget.  So I just want to thank you also for watching.  I hope that we've answered some of your curiosity and you saw Seth in a Gambian business.  The businesses that we recorded were Gambian businesses.  So these are in answer to some of the questions that I had about Gambian people running businesses and employing staff.  I just wanted to show you that this is happening and it's happening now and it's great.  So basically, I mean, I think it should be enough to give you an insight anyway, a little small, you know, inking about life here.  And I want that to kind of remind you of the fact that, you know, Africa is for the Africans home or abroad.  And there's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  So come home and thanks.  Please share.  Please like the videos.  I think my son's going to come and say, smash that like button.  And of course, please, if you haven't already, subscribe.  And if you know some friends who'd like to subscribe, let them know too.  But I want to say a special thanks to someone before I go, and that's Jamil Potter.  Thank you so much, Jamil Potter.  He gave us a donation, so I really, really appreciate it.  And tomorrow, we're going to go to a black African electrical shop to go and try and get a mic.  So, and then we're going to, you know, look at the other equipment there as well.  So thank you all so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed it.  And the next video, I'm going to give you a bit of a teaser.  It's going to include my husband and he's responding to some of the wonderful comments that we've had and also some of the criticism too.
