            "text": "Hey guys, why do women get tattoos?  And is dating a woman with a tattoo any different than dating a woman who doesn't have a tattoo?  Well, we're going to talk about that in this video.  If you're new to my channel my name is Anna Jorgensen.  I'm a dating coach for men in Vancouver, Canada.  So, first of all I'm not an expert in tattoo psychology and I did do some homework on this but it was pretty limited.  I also don't have any tattoos.  So, my initial thoughts were that women get tattoos because one, they're rebellious or they're rebelling against either society or their parents or something.  Two, they are more creative and it's a self-expression that is a part of what they want their identity to be.  Three, there's a sentimental attachment to perhaps a person or a plate or something meaningful to them that they want to have written on their body some kind of representation of to remind them or others.  Four, there is community and a place where they can bond with other people who have a similar experience at least with tattoos.  there's a community.  And five, to cover up or change areas of their body that they might not be happy with.  Like for example, practical reason would be if a woman has had a mastectomy and she's had her breasts removed.  she may want to tattoo a new nipple if that's been removed as well.  But also just generally to enhance body image in some way.  Those were my assumptions about why women get tattoos and I read five studies on this psychology of women and tattoos and basically most of my assumptions were fairly well supported.  There's a couple things to note that might be of interest to you if you either are attracted to women with tattoos or you're thinking of dating a woman with a tattoo or if you're turned off by women with tattoos.  So, here's what those things are that women with tattoos do have According to the studies that I read lower body image scores than women who don't have tattoos.  So, for example, a woman who has tattoos and these were women who were between 18 and 35.  It was a small study and they were from all different walks of life and in fact, there was a doctor who had tattoos that was also in the study group.  So, they tried to really put a range of different socioeconomic demographic in the study to make it balanced and fair.  They were testing to see whether or not tattoos has an influence on self-esteem.  And they did find in these studies at least women with tattoos do have lower levels of self-esteem and a greater variance between their perceived body image and their ideal body image in terms of tattoos.  So, in other words they were enhancing their bodies.  they felt that they were enhancing their bodies by adding tattoos.  Some of the other interesting things were that the women who had tattoos were five times more likely to be smokers where they in the study five times more were smokers.  They were much less educated formally than women who the women chosen who didn't have tattoos.  They tested higher for impulsivity and they also tested higher for risky behaviors and I'll get to why that's important in a minute.  One thing that they did note in the studies was that there have been other studies that have shown that women who get tattoos actually increase their self-esteem by getting their tattoos because their self-esteem is more directly related to their body image.  So, a lot of people think that self-esteem and body image are one in the same and they're not.  Self-esteem has to do with many other things other than just your body but it was more tightly correlated with women who have tattoos in that their body image is more directly related to whether or not to getting more tattoos.  So, the more tattoos they got the better they perceived their self-image.  The part that's applicable to you if you're dating a woman with tattoos or thinking about dating a woman with tattoos is that the reality of being higher in the area of impulsivity and risky behavior is that they may be more apt to sleep with you sooner.  And as a result of that if they've done that in the past with risky behaviors then there is potentially a greater likelihood that they're going to have STDs.  Now, again I haven't looked up the actual studies on that so not sure but it would seem like it would be relatively important.  And would you date someone with a tattoo?  Have you dated someone with a tattoo?  What are your feelings about tattoos?  I'm curious.  please leave your answer in the comments below.
