I don't know how I missed this, how I went off on this.  This came out months ago, but I had just seen a clip of this, and it was so fascinating that I had to talk about it.  So you guys know Ben Shapiro has his Sunday special show, which he brings on a guest every Sunday.  Dave Dubin, and a bunch of those other guys.  This one was with Tucker Carlson.  And Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro have a little bit of a, quite a big disagreement, honestly, in my opinion.  And we're going to look at them talking about that here.  But first, I do want to say that if you want to support the show, you can check out the Patreon page, patreon.com slash the progressive voice podcast.  I do want to give a thank you to D. Wayne, who pledged $10 a month, and I also want to give a thank you to Jennifer Kishpa, who has pledged $5 a month.  So if you would like to support the show, please go to patreon.com slash the progressive voice and donate today.  So I'm going to show you guys this debate clip.  They're going to get into it over economics, and it's going to be really, really interesting, and I want to talk about it.  So go ahead and check this out. ",

By the way, that's the same group whose wages have gone down by 11% over the past 30 years.  The social cost of eliminating their jobs in a 10-year span, five-year span, 30-year span is so high.  that it's not sustainable.  So the greater good is protecting your citizens from... Look, capitalism is the best economic system I can think of, I think, that anyone's ever thought of.  But that doesn't mean that it's a religion and everything about it is good.  There's no niacin creed of capitalism that I have to buy into.  what I care about.  is living in a country where, you know, decent people can live happy lives, actually.  And so, no, I would say immediately, no, are you joking?  And I maybe would make up some pretext for public consumption, like, oh, they're dangerous.  The technology is not quite finesse.  No, no.

I'm four machines, okay?  I'm just saying that there was a cost.  Half the world was enslaved for 70 years under Bolshevism because those countries didn't manage, I would argue, the transition from an agrarian economy into an industrial one.  That's what that was, okay?  So we're on the cusp of a completely transformative revolution, as or more transformative as the Industrial Revolution, And no one is trying to take control of it at all or figure out how to channel these forces into an outcome that we want to live with realistically.  And because they're not, you're going to see reactions and you're already seeing reactions against this stuff that are flat out extreme.  So the model again is Teddy Roosevelt, who was a capitalist, a patriot, a man of deep faith.  He was not anti-business, and yet he restrained American businesses.  He broke them up and was hated for doing it in the service of a higher goal, which was a stable, happy country where the traditions could be preserved.  If he didn't do that... You know, there's no telling, like, what would have happened to the wobbly, you know, the IWW or whatever.  We could have gone in a totally different direction. ",

            "text": "I mean, so I will admit I'm not a Teddy Roosevelt fan, and I would have opposed the trust busting.  But when it comes to the sort of politics we're talking about, I guess my major question is, is it a contributing factor to societal unrest to tell people that politics is to blame for the problem?  Are we edging on political messianism, the idea that if we just change a couple of policies here or there, then we'll be able to fix everything, when the reality is that, as you talk about a little bit in the book, what we may be suffering from is an actual spiritual malaise.  And maybe economics has something to do with it.  I would argue that it has a lot more to do with a generalized move away from social fabric driven by all the factors that exist in churches and all these things.  And that if we are going to maintain both freedom and stability, The John Adams formulation was that this Constitution was only built for moral and virtuous people.  It wasn't built for any other.  There are two ways to actually tackle that.  One is to say we are no longer moral and no longer virtuous, so we have to change the freedom.  And the other is to say, well, if we want to maintain the freedom, we have to become moral and virtuous again.  And I wonder if we as public figures, because we're in the same business more or less, where we ought to be putting our focus.  should we be putting our focus on justifying people's fears about the economy and suggesting that a political messiah is around the corner?  or should we be saying to people listen temporary stop gap.  perhaps we can stop technology from advancing.  perhaps we can stop trade from eating your job.  or should we be saying to people listen america was built by folks who crossed mountains to go to the middle of nowhere in pure risk and You are guaranteed nothing in the United States but the adventure of your life.  There are 7 million unfilled jobs.  Maybe we need to actually move.  Maybe you need to go to North Dakota and get a fracking job. ",

            "text": "Wow, man, this is super fascinating.  So, now, what I want to say is that what we're going to be really looking at here is what Tucker Carlson is saying there.  Because as you guys know, Tucker Carlson is a really big propagandist.  But, you know, it gets kind of wishy-washy, you know, because there, you know, he's supporting Teddy Roosevelt.  Who, by the way, Teddy Roosevelt did do the trust busting.  But my understanding was that Taft, who was the president after him, had done more trust busting but he was unpopular for it anyways.  so and you know he's there defending trust busting and and saving jobs et cetera et cetera.  but remember when he did his Amazon video where he goes after Jeff Bezos.  he says these are monopolies so we should lower regulations.  that's not the answer.  so full disclosure Tucker Carlson is a fraud.  however the things that we're gonna look at what he's saying here because it's very very interesting And it represents a really big conservative divide.  And I had also seen a Sunday special with Ben Shapiro where he had on... I believe his name is Stephen Moore.  Someone can correct me if I have that wrong.  He was a former conservative prime minister of Canada.  And he comes on there and he defends... uh their universal health care system.  and he also.  there's also a point where you know he's talking about how.  i forget if it was a trade deal or what exactly.  i think it was a bailout that he had to do the government bailing out an industry or business.  i forgot most likely it was an industry.  And, you know, he's basically saying, OK, well, I have the option of basically, you know, a government intervention in which I save like 100,000 jobs or not.  So I'm obviously going to, you know, have government intervention to save those jobs.  And I don't think Ben Shapiro was in favor of that, nor do I think, you know, he's sort of about that.  So it's really interesting to watch this divide because Tucker Carlson represents Donald Trump.  Ben Shapiro represents every other conservative.  People are tired of.  the normal neocons.  okay people are really tired of it.  and by the way also another caveat that i have to add or a disclaimer is donald trump campaigning and donald trump president two different people.  so we're going to be look kind of looking at uh you know campaign trump when we talk about this.  so campaign Trump.  What did campaign Trump say?  Let's bring the jobs back.  I want to bring the jobs back.  I want to make America great again.  You know, I'm not going to touch your health care, social security, and people in West Virginia who are in these town halls of Bernie Sanders are saying we voted for Trump because we thought that he was going to bring us health care and bring our jobs back.  Turns out he didn't really do any of that stuff.  But nevertheless, he campaigned on those things.  So it's a really interesting divide between the sort of old school neocon and Tucker Carlson really is taking a shot at Ben and his ilk.  where he's talking about, you know, he labels it, how do you label it?  He labeled it.  free market fundamentalism is what he called it, which is a very, it's a good term.  I like that term because that's what it is.  But to see a conservative who now is representative of a lot of Republicans, Tucker Carlson is a representative of a lot of Republicans now.  He's a really, you know, a really big host, has a really big show, and it's really absolutely insane.  And if you go through the comments section, virtually every single person is in agreement with Tucker Carlson.  They're saying, my stock, my Tucker Carlson stock just went up.  My stock for Tucker Carlson just went up.  My respect for him went up.  You know, Tucker Carlson cares about the average Joe.  There's a lot of, you know, anti-Jew stuff, which is, you know, scary shit.  But anyways... there was nobody who's defending Ben Shapiro there, basically, is what I'm trying to tell you.  So there's a really big divide that's coming up in this.  And when you hear Tucker Carlson talk about the industrial workers of the world, the IWW, or how labor unions have gone down, or how, I think he said that the value of labor has gone down.  He's talking about They get into it about the whole issue of whether or not we should stop technology increasing and advancements in technology to save jobs.  Now, here's also something interesting, though.  So, Tucker's saying, yeah, let's stop.  Like, if I could, I would stop the technological increases and advancements in order to preserve the jobs because... As a country, you can't have a shit ton of people unemployed.  Social cohesion is something that is not taken very seriously, and when you have too much wealth inequality, the social cohesion takes a massive hit, especially when they're unemployed, because that means that they're just going to be even more angry, and that is not good for social cohesion.  So if you've got massive wealth concentration amongst a small amount of people, as well as a ton of people unemployed, how do you think that's going to end up for the country?  Also, how do you feel about that as your country?  Like for me as a country, I mean, I really base the goodness of a country or the quality of a country based on the lives of, you know, the people by and large.  So, you know, which country has the happiest people on the planet, right?  I think usually it's Denmark or Norway or one of those Scandinavian countries.  So, you know, we should be sort of trying to go for that.  We.  But when he talks about technology, another route that could be taken is we could find a way to basically have it so that technology just knocks out all those jobs anyways.  Like take them, but then we have to redistribute wealth in a way that people don't need to be doing those stupid jobs.  Because what is the purpose of, you know, we should transcend the nonsense of having people have to do these kinds of, you know, uh, nine to five robotic jobs that human beings are doing, which is basically just like, you know, just fucking shackle life.  I mean, you're who like, who wants to do that kind of stuff?  You know what I'm saying?  Like people want to do interesting shit.  People have passions that they can't make a living off of despite it having, you know, usually there's some sort of value that is given to society based off of it.  but there's just no way to make money on it because of the profit motive and all that other nonsense that ends up convoluting and polluting this whole situation.  But if we can find a way to basically... have technology advanced so that all those jobs are gone but now we redistribute wealth from all the tech oligopolies and technocrats and monopolies and shit and all the CEOs and insanely rich people to where people can now do their passion jobs.  that's an ideal society in my opinion.  I don't even know what Ben's idea for the future even is, like the technological increase.  Like, if you have a technological increase, you have to do something.  Tucker Carlson wants to say, if I could stop it, I would, to keep the jobs.  I think we should move towards a society where... You know, it's essentially inevitable at this point that jobs are going to be taken up by automation.  So, this is a great opportunity.  I think I had even heard, like, Sam Harris talk about this.  Sam Harris was like, well, yeah, people can do, you know, think about all of the potential that there is for valuable things that can be given to society through their work.  You know, people don't want to be doing those nine to five dead jobs at office desks and fucking... sitting there all day doing shit they don't want to do.  People don't want to do that.  People want to do stuff they enjoy.  You know what I mean?  And there's so few people who are fortunate enough to be in the circumstances and have the opportunity to actually do what they want for a living due to different circumstances.  And so we should be able to find a way to redistribute wealth into some way because there will be too much wealth concentrated amongst too little amount of people to where it's unsustainable.  So That I found super interesting.  Also, another thing I observed in that whole conversation is Tucker, where as he's explaining himself, he has to constantly, constantly, constantly keep putting in, he has to keep going, yeah, yeah, well, you know, do I believe in capitalism?  Yeah.  Do I want people to take stuff?  No, no, no, no.  I don't want someone to take my stuff, yada, yada, yada.  Every single thing he's saying, he has to throw in that caveat, which is really interesting to me.  I don't know why.  And then Ben Shapiro goes, well, you know, well, regulation is basically taking money away from people.  And Tucker Carlson goes, oh, that's kind of a talking point, but whatever.  It's a really weird situation, man, because Tucker Carlson is basically going on this sort of, let's call it what it is, pretty much a sort of lefty-leaning economic ideology.  um you know and he's.  but he's upholding at least the basis in the foundation of a sort of conservative slash right wing slash free market belief system.  it's very odd to watch.  um i don't know man it was super hell.  by the way i have to mention this.  tucker's like yeah we should you know care about.  the average people are the people who are under you.  and tucker also makes it a point to basically say like Why?  Why should you want to, like, you know, work for some douchey business owner, shareholder or whatever?  Like there are concerns of normal people.  And he goes, he's like, you should care about people who are under you.  And Ben's like, well, yeah, of course.  That's why.  That's why there's charity.  Dude, you don't care at all about poor people.  Charity is a lazy, dumb excuse to have because that's never going to cover people.  You need systemic change to actually help people.  And it's just ridiculous.  You honestly think Ben Shapiro cares about poor people and people under him?  He doesn't care about them.  He's a robotic machine.  He has no feelings.  He has no soul.  He's an asshole.  I mean, he's not a good person.  He doesn't care about normal people.  And that's why he is this sort of free market fundamentalist, as Tucker Carlson puts it.  But anyways, I found that to be unbelievably interesting.  So, I want to know your guys' thoughts on this.  And again, I want to say, Tucker Carlson... Also, actually, I have to add this last part in, too.  A lot of what he's saying there ends up getting tied into race as well.  So this kind of nationalist type of rhetoric, it ends up also getting tied into that.  So you have to be careful with that as well.  But all in all, let me know your thoughts on this down below. ",
