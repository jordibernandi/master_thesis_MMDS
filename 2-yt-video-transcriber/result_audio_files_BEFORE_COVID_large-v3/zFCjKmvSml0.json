            "text": "Listen YouTube, we're here to talk about country c***s. I don't know.  Country c***s?  Oh my god.  That was vulgar.  Hey Dan, my name is Darnell and I'm a huge fan.  Noticed on your Instagram you had a picture of a girl and you called her a buckle bunny.  What does that mean and how do I find one?  So before I answer this, I do these every week.  They're called Ask Dan's.  I'm not going to mark them like that anymore.  But if you all have a question that you want answered about anything cowboy rodeo, really anything country, Follow my Instagram, send me a DM, let me know what your question is.  Don't send me something stupid.  Some dude today sent me a message that said, I matched with my sister on Tinder.  Should I swipe right or left?  I feel like that's pretty self-explanatory.  Right, obviously.  This is Natalia.  She is my sister.  She is number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan.  So what is a buckle bunny?  A buckle bunny is God's gift to man.  No, well, kind of, yeah.  A buckle bunny is a woman that chases rodeo cowboys past and present who won or win belt buckles.  The sheer sight of a cowboy in a rodeo trophy buckle gets them so wet that they have to change their panties.  I'm talking like Atlantic Ocean wet.  Niagara Falls.  As you can see on that video on my Instagram, that girl was pretty much licking my belt buckle in the middle of a honky tonk.  I compare buckle bunnies with cleat chasers.  For example, the two women who flashed Garrett Cole during the World Series.  By the way, God bless your hearts.  That's outstanding work.  See, that's what buckle bunnies do for cowboys at rodeos, except we don't kick them out.  You take them back to your trailer after and you show them the leather.  Now some of you, because you think that buckle bunnies are always around rodeos, means they know everything about rodeos.  They don't.  At all.  I'll give you an example.  I was out with my buddy one night and this girl comes up to me and she was like, do you guys ride steers?  What?  Or another time my buddy showed this girl a picture of one of his newly born calves and she was like, that's a super nice goat.  That's just dumb.  But who likes smart women?  I don't.  Where can you find a buckle bunny?  First place is at rodeos.  They're going to be the ones in super short daisy dukes and a shirt that looks like a bra yelling at one of the cowboys that just got off one of the bulls.  Maybe their boobs will slip out, maybe they won't.  Who knows?  What do you do in a situation like this if you're the bull rider?  You say, hi ma'am, I'm gonna need your shirt to wipe the blood off of my knuckles.  See what I did there?  Second place would be to honky tonk.  Just look for the most provocatively dressed girl in the bar.  Also the drunkest.  Possibly riding a mechanical bull with her shorts all the way in her ass.  So most of them don't know how to two step, but they can definitely shake their ass.  But look, we're not complaining here.  Lastly, how can you get a buckle bunny?  This is a tough one because if you're not a real cowboy or you weren't a real cowboy, You're kind of out of luck, man.  Unless you go to a boot shop and buy a complete getup and a buckle, but here's the problem with that.  A real buckle bunny doesn't know a lot about life.  But they do know the difference between what a rodeo champion belt buckle looks like and one that you bought on Amazon for $13.  They're stupid, but not that stupid.  I don't think anyone is that stupid.  Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, would an idiot do that?  And if they would, I do not do that thing.  Please don't be that guy that goes to Boot Barn and buys a whole cowboy getup when you've never seen the ass end of a bull before.  Or even rode a horse.  That's like me dressing up as a rapper.  I've never wrapped before.  Well, technically that's not true.  I wrapped a few presents last night for your mom because she's a buckle bunny.  Thank you for watching my video.  If y'all would like me to answer any questions for y'all, send me a DM on Instagram.  When the storm rolls in, I'm gonna be ready.  Savvy's on my hip in case he gets heavy.  Like a cowboy kicking down doors and taking names.  John Wayne. ",
