            "text": "What's happening, fam?  LAR Movers still moving.  Book is entitled Lessons from a Non-Custodial Father at Amazon, Kindle, and CreateSpace.  Link will be in the description box below, as usual.  Go get it.  PayPal link there also to ask me to put it up, so I'll put it up.  Thanks, everybody, for supporting.  This video, though, this video is entitled Old Thoughts of Losers.  Man, I saw something on social media that just made me like, oh, God.  So, in lieu of, you know, seeing all these challenges and all of these responses to, you know, I'm just doing what I gotta do to feed my family type responses, we just gonna have to have this conversation.  Old thoughts are losers.  And when I mean old 30 and up, this is what I mean.  Some of you ladies, you know, thought you was gonna be fine and cute and you could rest on your looks forever.  Now, there are a lot of women who are 30 and up sisters on social media that are beautiful, but the problem is you're just an old thigh.  Besides your sexuality, what do you bring to the table?  And the fact that you're still using it at the age of 30 and up is deplorable.  The fact that you're still excusing your behavior as if you don't know how to do anything else but be a slut is stupid.  You know, but that's the choice, you know, that's the choice people make.  Now, having a conversation, maybe about a week, two weeks ago with somebody about something similar.  And I was like, look, I think some of y'all need to look at the women that you modeled yourselves after.  That you thought were so great.  And, you know, they were strong and this, that, and the third.  Look at how they are now.  Because I saw, I was watching Solo TV 84 yesterday, two days ago.  And what's up, Solo?  And IncelTV82.  And a young lady was talking about, you know, she's in her 20s and she's like, you know, I met a guy that he's nice and he could be like my husband, but she wanted to go kicking and partying, right?  And those women... We saw those women when I was younger and it's the same story all over again with the same response of, it ain't gonna happen to me.  I'm different, I'm special.  I'm gonna turn it off and I'm gonna just snag me a man at whatever age and then I'm gonna get married and be happily ever after because I just got it like that.  Not looking down on society and seeing all the women who are 30 and up Who still act like they're in high school or college or just fresh out of college with that mentality that I could just be a brat or I could just be bitchy.  and that's sexy.  Because I'm cute.  Didn't work out.  But everybody's got to be special.  Now the reason I bring that up is for this reason in particular.  you look at you know mary j blige and tony braxton and keisha cole and amber rose and and uh trina and lil kim and foxy brown.  you know i'm not.  your sisters look at beyonce a certain way too you know.  um they got on alicia keys for years about being a home wrecker but all of the women that you you know took their their ideologies and like.  i want to be just like them.  you know 10 15 5 10 15 years ago.  nikki minaj.  yeah look at him now.  do you want to be cardi b five years from now?  do you you know?  look at how.  look at their their their their dating and marriage are.  look at what they wound up with them with the situation they wound up being with all the rhetoric they were spewing.  and if you imitating his rhetoric the negative parts of it in particular a you might wind up the very same way or you or your life might mirror that.  right now.  and we're talking about women who are attractive.  you know guys we don't care about money like that.  but attractive rich and grown you know They can't even, you know, their whole shtick got them by their doggone selves of looking real stupid out here in these streets, for the most part.  You know, Ashanti and all that, right?  But you're not going to say you're a loser.  Yeah, they're losers.  The very men that they wanted to look over, the very men that they want to help them now.  You see them on these flyers, in bathing suits, still trying to be a booty model.  They fine, but it's like, what did you do with all the money you made when you was hot?  Because if you still doing this this exact same way, it's not going to work out well.  And the reason I say it's not going to work out well, because, you know, ladies felt like, you know, thoughts are winning.  But that's in the beginning.  It doesn't end well.  You know, you can't, and with social media being the way it is, you can't scrub the internet of all the BS that you put on the internet.  You know, which is going to be problematic, to say the least, because now you got to explain this to your kids and grandkids.  And that's why I said people in 30 and up are losers, because they got children and grandchildren out here.  And they're like, and you're not really getting it.  You know, what is it?  Black China, her mama out here looking crazy.  You know, and now they're like, I see why she crazy, because look at her mama.  And here's a problem.  Because now you look like a complete loser.  I mean, because of your own actions and your own ideologies.  You know?  And some of y'all, you know, was so fine, you resting on when you was fine back in the day, and you don't even realize you let yourself go.  You know?  And getting into these other things real quick.  This mindset that, you know, You can do the same trick from 20 to 60 with men is ridiculous.  Because a beautiful woman is always a turn on.  But the older a woman gets, the less refined and feminine she is, it becomes more and more of a turn off.  You don't know how to dress like a lady?  You know how to conduct yourself like a lady?  You can't walk in heels?  Like, what is this?  You gotta be, you know, combative everywhere you go?  You know, I can have sex just like a man.  Okay, do you have to say it in public, loud, so everybody can hear you in that way?  You know, you look like you tripping.  Because, you know, People are having this mid-life thought crisis.  You know, I got to put it all out on the line now.  I got to show I got the best cucumber challenge around now because if I don't, I got to snag somebody.  I done had 39 ballers, 14 doctors, 2 lawyers, 7 drug dealers, and a few good men, but... I didn't realize I should have kept one of them.  Okay.  Now what?  Now I'm pregnant.  Now I'm 40 years old and I'm pregnant by a 22-year-old guy.  Okay.  See, them slut walks look real cool until y'all seen Amber Rose walking around pregnant about her boy.  You're like, really?  I mean, Kanye West.  don't look too crazy now that he with Kim Kardashian.  Y'all say he crazy, but he got a whole family in his marriage.  seems to be rolling just fine, even though all the scrutiny went on with it.  I mean, Amber Rose, she probably wish she had Kanye or Wiz.  She got rid of Kanye and Wiz, and now, look at her.  Now she just marching, you know.  People, y'all, you know, wanted to be Nicki Minaj.  Now she with the dude, and, you know.  She did, she was with Nas at a point.  I'm just saying, Meek Mill look like he doing all right now.  Nas, everybody loves Nas.  But Safaree, this dude, Safaree, I mean, it's not looking good.  It's not looking good.  But to take on that mindset, Lil' Kim, black Kim, not Asian Lil' Kim.  Same Lil' Kim, but she was black, now she's Asian.  because of all the insecurities.  that's the issue.  you know.  marriage Jake.  you know what I'm like.  I know the dude did it wrong, but she did herself wrong, too.  Y'all got to stop acting like she's not off the chain.  Because I remember years prior, she hit the dude in public in front of everybody.  I was like, oh, that's the beginning of the end right there.  You know.  And she had already said she was wilder when they first met.  So, it is what it is.  So, you know, I'm just saying.  Old thoughts are losers.  Don't pattern yourself after a loser.  So, I'm done.
