Because even when you drop a ball, like, about Dr.  Sebi.  Yeah.  Like, just that one thing that killed Dr.  Sebi will make somebody go research who Dr.  Sebi is.  100%.  Dr.  Sebi.  Dr.  Sebi.  My bad.  I said it wrong.  I'm an L.A.  nigga, man.  My lingo a little different, man.  Have you met Dr.  Sebi?  I never met him.  I met his wife, and I take his products for sure.  Now, the coolest guy ever, I mean, he was, when we interviewed him, I think he was about 74.  Oh, y'all interviewed him?  Yeah, we interviewed him twice.  Damn.  Not here, but when I was on the other show.  He was able to jump from the floor up here on his knees.  At 70-something.  He jumped back down to no problems, nothing like that.  Why do you think they killed him?  Why do they kill all holistic doctors?  Messing up the medical insurance.  You short-stopping that grind.  Why do niggas get killed for hustling in front of a nigga's spot?  You short-stopping the grind.  And these niggas, they check as billions.  You got niggas that get flipped for a couple hundred thousand.  So you playing with some pharmaceutical money.  And what's crazy, I'm working on doing a documentary on the trial in 1985 when Dr.  Sebi went to trial against New York because he put in the newspaper he cured AIDS.  He beat the case.  And he went to federal court the next day and beat that case on record.  And nobody talk about it. ",

Okay, the enemy's hand is all in this.  I'm going to give you some information that you need to know.  One, five shots to the body, one to the head.  Five shots to the body, one to the head.  That is a military-style hit.  It was in and out.  The way it happened was in and out, very quick.  The United States government, and I just say this specifically, in downtown L.A.  a couple months ago, have been practicing military drills, practicing military drills, going in and out of businesses, and they've been practicing on maneuvers in downtown LA.  Now, I want you to understand this.  There have not been major gang wars in a while.  There have not been major gang wars in quite some time, and because of this, The government does not have a justifiable reason to bring down the National Guard.  So what this has done is this has now sparked the 40s, the 60s, multiple hoods to trigger And once you get these hoods to trigger, once you get these hoods to retaliate against one another, it then gives the government justification to bring down the National Guard.  That's what it does.  Okay?  They have been planning this for quite some time.  And I'm saying this because if you are from the hood, Do not, do not, I'm saying this for the Bloods, Crips, anybody in the hood.  Do not start shooting at other hoods.  Do not start shooting at other hoods.  That is not how you handle this.  The enemy has been all in this.  Just understand that.  Right now, this is where I'm at.  The enemy has his hands all in this.  And if you are not going to retaliate in the proper manner, and what I mean by this is, this is the time.  Just to go back to the Dr.  Sebi thing real quick, what makes you want to do a documentary?  Okay, Sebi.  Get it right, man.  What makes you want to do a documentary about Dr.  Sebi?  I think the story's important.  I think it's a powerful narrative.  It is.  You know what I mean?  And I think if, imagine this, anybody in this room, if I could say, hey, somebody cured AIDS, y'all be like, yeah, right.  And then I can show you an example of him going to trial and proving in a court to a jury that he cured AIDS.  Y'all would be interested in that.  Absolutely.  And y'all would look into the way he did it, right?  So I feel like more so than like championing his products or explaining his methodology, Put some light on that case. ",
