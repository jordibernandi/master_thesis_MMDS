I guess it was an accident over here or something.  So I just came to check it out.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, so I guess some kind of collision went on between this landscaping truck and that car over there.  I'm assuming that damage on the from this car, the side of this car is from this accident.  All right.  All right.  What happened?  Couldn't speak five minutes ago?  What?  You would stop that, right?  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  um All right, guys, so no problems on that one.  Everybody was stepping my way.  And I'll catch you on the next one.  Walk them, walk them out. ",
