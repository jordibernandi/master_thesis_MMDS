            "text": "No, because his human nature died, not his divine nature.  In fact, that's an excellent question.  Let's just give just a couple of minutes on this, because I've talked to imams about the Trinity, and they had a very different definition of the Trinity than Christians have.  The Trinity is three persons in one nature.  So here you have one divine nature in this triangle, and obviously you have three corners in the triangle.  So you have Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in one divine nature.  The Son, Jesus, also has a human nature.  These two natures don't intermingle.  So when Jesus died... God didn't die, right?  So this human nature is perfect.  And so when he lives a perfect life in our place and takes punishment, he's not suffering punishment for his sins.  He didn't have any.  He's suffering punishment for our sins.  And so when we trust in him, then we can be saved.  So the imams I spoke to thought that the Trinity was God having sex with Mary yielding Jesus, right?  That's not the biblical view of the Trinity.  And so whenever you ask a question about Jesus, you actually always have to ask two questions.  In fact, let's look at it this way.  God is one what, but he has three who's, whereas Jesus is one who with two what's.  So whenever you're asking a question about who to, you've got to ask which.  what are you talking about.  Are you talking about what one or what two?  when you're talking about who to?  This is the Abbott and Costello theology here.  The point here is that... People will say, how could Jesus be God and not know when he was coming back?  Well, did Jesus know when he was coming back as God?  Yes.  Did he know when he was coming back as man?  No.  Did Jesus get hungry as God know as man?  Yes.  Did Jesus die as God know as man?  Yes.  Jesus has two natures, and those two natures answer a lot of the problems that people often have with the Trinity.  If you understand he has two natures, then those questions make more sense. ",

He existed as the second person of the Trinity, but he didn't exist as a human.  Now, this is similar to Islam in this sense.  Because, as you know, the prime sin in Islam is shirk.  That's putting partners with God.  But Islam actually does that.  Because Islam believes that Allah is eternal and so is the Quran.  Those are two different things.  So Islam is saying that I have a God and I also have something else that exists eternally, a book.  Whereas Christianity says God is eternal and this human nature comes into existence just over 2,000 years ago.  Or just under 2,000 years ago.  Actually, just over 2,000 years ago.  Excuse me.  I'm getting my dates all wrong here.  Okay? ",
