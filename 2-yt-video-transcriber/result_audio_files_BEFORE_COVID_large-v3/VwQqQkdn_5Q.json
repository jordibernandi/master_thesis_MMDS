Well, I wonder if you know him.  Do you know him?  Don't try to mislead me.  Do you know my king?  David said the heavens declare the glory of God and the fundament showeth his handiwork.

He's the superlative of everything good that you choose to call him.  Well, he's the only one able.  to supply all of our needs simultaneously.  He supplies strength for the weak.  He's available for the tempted and the tried.  He sympathizes and He saves.  He starves hearts and He guides.  He heals the sick.  He cleanses the lepers.  He forgives sinners.

Pilate couldn't find any fault in him.  The witnesses couldn't get their testimonies to agree.  Herod couldn't kill him.  Death couldn't handle him and the grave couldn't hold him.  That's my king.  He always has been and he always will be.  I'm talking about he had no predecessor and he'll have no successor.  There was nobody before him and there'll be nobody after him.  You take him, teach him and he's not going to resign.  That's my king.  That's my key.  Kind is the kingdom and the power and the glory.  All the power belongs to my key.  We around here talking about black power and white power.  And green power.  But it's God's power.  Thine is the power.  Yeah.  And the glory.  We try to get prestige and honor and glory for ourselves.  But the glory is all His.  Yeah.  Thine is the kingdom.  And the power.  And the glory.  Forever.  And ever.  And ever.  And ever.  How long is that?  And ever.  And ever.  And ever.  And ever.  And when you get through with all of them forever, then amen.  Thank you. ",
