            "text": "Very good question, which is, if Nazism and Communism are both leftist, how come they went to war?  First of all, it's important to realize that ideologies that are very close to each other frequently do go to war.  The Catholics and the Protestants, the Shia and the Sunni.  The Shia and the Sunni are both in the house of Islam.  They actually agree on 99% of theological beliefs, but they've been fighting for centuries.  Why?  Competitions over territory and power and so on.  Remember that Hitler was a national socialist.  The reason that Hitler hated the communists was not because they were socialists.  He liked that part about it.  What he didn't like is that they were taking their orders from Moscow.  He saw them as traitors to Germany.  So Hitler's priority was socialism in Germany.  Now remember that Hitler, who went to war with Stalin, was allied with Stalin.  So on the foreign policy domain, Hitler was perfectly happy to sign the Hitler-Stalin pact and then violate it for reasons of national interest.  So the bottom line of it is the fact that Germany and the Soviet Union went to war.  in no way refutes the idea that progressivism, communism, and fascism were all three sister movements that developed in Germany, in Italy, in America, and in Russia, all in response to the crisis of Marxism.  The Republican Party has been nominating one Boy Scout after another.  McCain, Romney.  Romney is such an unbelievable Boy Scout.  I mean, if I were writing his college recommendation to Texas A&M, it would begin with something like this, not since Jesus Christ.  Not since Jesus Christ.  Squeaky clean.  But here's the problem.  The moment Romney comes onto the national stage, within five minutes, the left makes him into Lucifer.  You're greedy, you're selfish, you're an exploiter.  Where did you get $200 million?  And Romney is on the defensive, up against the wall, explaining, apologizing.  Now, you notice that nobody makes this accusation against Trump.  Nobody goes, hey, Trump, where did you get a billion?  Trump has more money than Romney.  How did you get a billion dollars?  You can't do this to Trump because if you do it, he'll sit you down and explain to you that he has two billion dollars.  He's a lot richer than you thought.  So with Trump, this desire to hit back I think reflects a tendency in the Republican Party now to say, okay, if you gangsterize one side, the other side has to get tough.  That's the sad reality of the situation.  In other words, would we like to live in the kinder, gentler Reagan era that I grew up in?  Yes, but that era is not here anymore.  Reagan wouldn't understand it.  He'd be a fish out of water because the political waters are too roiled right now.  But the one guy I think who would be completely at home in America today is Abraham Lincoln.  Why?  Because the waters were even more roiled when Lincoln came in.  And Lincoln realized, a very moderate man, by the way, that there was a time to be extremely tough.  The basic idea of fascism was government control over the private economy and government control over the lives of citizens.  That's the meaning of fascism.  That's what it is.  That's what the Nazis were all about, the National Socialist Party.  In my movie... In my movie... In my movie... We believe Dr.  Ford.  We believe Dr.  Ford.  We believe Dr.  Ford.  Well... We believe Dr.  Ford.  We believe Dr.  Ford.  We believe Dr.  Ford.  Well, we have some Dr.  Ford enthusiasts here.  Let me ask you this question.  Let me ask you guys this question.  Well, okay, if you'll stop chatting, I'll address your point.  Here's something interesting.  Where is Dr.  Ford?  You know, this is really interesting.  I noticed that when Roy, hold on, don't shout at me.  You'll have a chance to ask questions.  When Roy Moore was attacked by all these women, he oppressed me.  He did this, he did that.  And suddenly, when he's defeated, they all melt into air.  This is Karl Marx.  All that is solid melts into air.  Suddenly, the media, hold on, don't shout at me.  Don't shout at me.  No, you came voluntarily.  Did I ask you to come?  No, don't shout at me.  I'm defending fascism.  No, I'm exposing you as a fascist.  Because, because.  Do you realize, I'll tell you how.  You ask me a question.  Hold on.  How am I a fascist for people who are hurtful and great and they're great?  Are you familiar with the black shirts in Italy or the brown shirts in Germany?  Do you realize that they would go to campuses, ",

My leading public critic on this, the Princeton historian Kevin Cruz, who says things like that there was a big switch.  And then when I point out to him that there wasn't, he says, what about Jesse Helms?  What about Trent Lott?  What about John Tower?  And I say, well, let's not debate apples and oranges.  Those men are not Dixiecrats.  Just to find a Southern Democrat who became a Republican isn't going to make your case.  You have to find racist Dixiecrats and show me those guys who are accountable.  If you Google racist Dixiecrats, a whole number of names will come up on your phone.  We're talking about those guys.  And so I told Kevin Cruz, why don't I come to your home campus, Princeton University.  Let's have a debate in front of your own students.  You have all the advantages of being on your home ground.  You're going to have the home team advantage.  His response, I won't do it.  He refuses.  He says it's not the proper format to resolve these issues.  Think of it.  Debate is not a proper format to resolve an important difference of agreement.  And I take that to really mean that what he's saying is, look, here at Princeton, we have enough leftists in the history department that we've got our students completely brainwashed.  Your type is not going to be welcome here, because the only thing you can do is make converts, and that's going to be incendiary for us.  So we're not going to let that happen. ",

            "text": "I agree 100%.  I'm a product of the Reagan years.  If you remember, Reagan and the Democrats legislated tax bills together.  They did social security commissions together.  They did a tax reform in 1986 together.  There was a lot of bipartisan support for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Gorbachev and the Russians.  Not that there wasn't disagreement, but there was the ability to work together.  And the media reflected that debate.  CNN, for example, had a famous show, Crossfire.  And they would have Pat Buchanan on the right, Michael Kinsley on the left.  That's the America I came of age in.  And I long for it now.  The reason, but we don't live in that America.  Think of it.  Would CNN today dare to have a show in which they had, let's just say, for example, me against Rachel Maddow?  I mean, a debate, admittedly, that would be more like one-hand clapping.  But nevertheless, they wouldn't dare.  And when they cancel Crossfire, they decided to go full left.  They'll have a panel of eight people.  They're all anti-Trump.  They don't allow debate.  So how do you expect to have compromise when the mainstream media has arrayed its guns against Trump and they see their job as trying to take him out?  If you want to know why I seem passionate now and not quite the same guy I was in 1985, it's this.  I always thought American politics was a fair-minded debate between reasonable people who disagree.  And I wrote and conducted myself that way.  But then when I went through what I did with the Obama administration, when I stood in a courtroom and heard a bailiff go, United States of America versus Dinesh D'Souza, when I began to deal with these people, I realized we have seen a gangsterization of the US government.  I will tell you, based upon the deepest bone in my being, that if the Obama administration could have locked me up for 20 years, for giving a $20,000 political contribution, they would have done it.  They would have been delighted to do it because they did not see me as a critic, but as a deadly enemy that they needed to take out.  That was the way they looked at it.  And so I'm saying, you're very naive if you don't realize that this is going on in America.  This is today, we don't live in an America where if the government comes after you, they're not going to send two gentlemen with a file to talk to you.  They're going to send police cars, helicopters overhead, automatic weapons.  And until it happens to you, you won't believe it.  But when it does happen to you, you do become politically somewhat radicalized.  Because you realize this is going on in our America.  And before we can have compromise, we need to stop it. ",
