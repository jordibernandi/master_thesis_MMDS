            "text": "Gentlemen, awesome to be back with you on MGTOW Money.  Today's topic, Escape from America.  Before we get to that, thanks to the ongoing support from the Patreon investors in this channel.  Welcome Rex.  Welcome Mayus, the newest Patreon supporters of this channel.  And thanks to you also, you guys who bought me a cup of coffee via Bitcoin, PayPal.  on the last video.  men see the video description today.  become a supporter of this channel and show your respect for this channel.  before we get into today's topic i want to briefly mention an outstanding book that i read it ties in here.  i think i might have mentioned this book before.  i'm going to include a link in the video description.  the book's title is i walked away and that title says it all as you're going to hear in just a second again see the video description today.  go to that book.  i walked away.  All right, on to today's topic, escape from America.  I don't know about you men, but I'm going to say something declarative and go ahead and get your keyboard ready to get your defamatory comments and your insulting comments directed towards me ready because here goes.  America sucks.  Yeah, you heard me clearly.  America with a K-S-U-X.  It sucks.  Have you ever thought about walking away?  I mean, just sort of getting rid of everything.  Let me give you a brief example.  I was recently talking to a guy, an acquaintance of mine that I've known for the past year or two.  And I'm just going to call him Joe.  Joe's a guy who's late 60s.  He's an American.  He's from California.  And as he said to me, we're both in a foreign country right now.  As he said to me, I haven't been back in over 20 years and there is no effing way I'm going back.  I have zero interest in going back.  That's what he told me in a nutshell.  And his thoughts, by the way, are consistent with many other Americans, Australians, Canadians, and Brits that I've encountered.  Now, I didn't say all and every single one, but numerous.  certainly more than one or two, this is a common sentiment that I hear, that many of them never want to go back to their home country, or if they do, they rarely go back.  They just have, as they perceive, quote-unquote, no reason to go back.  There's nothing keeping them, requiring them to go back, and so they are men that have rights.  walked away.  Of course, that begs the question in my mind, at least, especially when it comes to Americans.  Why would these men have walked away from, quote unquote, the greatest country in the world, quote unquote, according to many Americans themselves who continually tell themselves.  So I'll leave that hanging out there.  I will leave.  let you leave your comments and your opinions as to why these men would choose to walk away from quote-unquote the greatest country in the world.  however for me leaving aside the western culture and in particular in the united states where it seems to be spawned from the gynocracy the rising stw's the the enormous rising tide of socialism that we're seeing here etc.  i I've got three actionable ideas for you, my MGTOW brother, to put into play.  I'm going to split these up relative to age.  One, if you're under 25, this is what you need to do.  You need to get on a plane and go to a country quickly, whether it be tomorrow, in a week, in a month, etc.  You need to get on a plane and go to another country.  Specifically, I recommend flying.  going to another country in which at the very least the population doesn't look like you.  if if you're a white guy don't go to another country where it's a bunch of white people.  or if you're a black person frankly don't go to another country where it's a bunch of black people.  Go to a country where you're a minority, where you stand out.  And furthermore, ideally also, go to a country that is much poorer, at least is somewhat poorer from you.  And thirdly, in my opinion, ideally, go to a country where you do not speak the language.  So whether you go for a few days or a few weeks, go.  Get on a plane and go somewhere.  Go try it once.  Whether you go by yourself, whether you go with a group of six people, go try it.  Go try it just once.  Look, you can fly to a country.  for next to nothing with points.  i've done videos in the past about this.  this can be done.  i have been doing this for years plural for decades as a matter of fact going back to my approximately late 20s when i've been doing this types of stuff.  furthermore especially with today with airbnb with vrbo with just youth hostels that have proliferated around the world there are plenty of cheap places to you to for you to stay.  it doesn't require a lot of money.  The point being is that you need to see how other people live.  And at the very least, at the very least, one thing you're going to get out of this is you will develop a tremendous amount of gratitude for the life that you have.  And furthermore, ideally, I hope you will start considering the future future.  possibility i stress that the future possibility of using especially for a young man using what's called geographic arbitrage.  specifically what i'm talking about men is earn in the west spend in the east.  that's a simple way of put it.  let me give you a specific example.  Several men have commented, for example, they have decided to move to places like Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines.  Another example, one American has commented over a year or so ago that he was living in Greece while working remotely for an American company and was being paid in U.S.  dollars.  The point is, this is what would be called geographic arbitrage.  They're earning money in a relatively strong currency and they're spending it outside of.  In all these examples, I can virtually guarantee you these men have chosen to do this because they are getting a seriously upgraded lifestyle.  They're getting a greater standard of living outside their home country, outside the West.  Furthermore, they're getting a serious adventure.  In other words, every time they walk outside their residence, I virtually guarantee you, they see the world as a really exciting place that they probably don't see when they walk outside their residence in the PC world.  All right, next, for a man that's 45 years plus, and I know this applies to a lot of men, you don't have much money.  This applies to the vast majority of Western men.  You're 45 plus years old.  You're still going to the same job.  You don't have much money.  And you see that light at the end of the tunnel that in about 20 years or so, it's going to be over.  You're either going to be dead.  You're going to be dead or dead broke or probably both.  The point is that you don't want to work until you're 75.  And that's okay.  One idea that I have.  highly encourage i cannot stress enough i've seen a lot of guys do this is don't seriously consider the possibility of moving overseas.  i would put it at the top of my priority list.  i was in that situation.  it should be your primary game plan.  it should be your primary solution if you will.  it should be a the the optimal solution in my opinion.  the point being is that let me give it to you simply you're not stuck.  you don't have to be sitting where you are going to work forever, and literally dying on the job.  You need to seriously consider moving.  You can choose to join an increasingly high number of men.  Again, I'm speaking from direct experience as a man who has lived cumulatively overseas for several years now, and has traveled over two dozen or so different countries.  You can do this.  And I can assure you, if nothing else, I'm not going to be joining you.  If you choose to stay in the West and work to your 70s, leave me out.  I will not be joining you.  Lastly, something for all men, that if nothing else, I want you to seriously consider.  Go back to that statement that I made right up front.  America sucks.  America, and this applies in general in the West, but especially into the United States, people are obviously becoming lonelier.  They're becoming sadder.  They're becoming more depressed.  These are all objective facts.  These are not opinions.  Bowling alone, that book that was written over three decades ago, was prescient in terms of it was telling you this is what's coming down the road.  People are becoming increasingly isolated.  They are simply very unhappy.  Yes.  America is a fantastic place to earn a lot of money relative to any other place in the world.  There is no question about it.  And if you're ranging from age from 25 to 45, that should be your primary consideration.  Earn as much money as you possibly can in the shortest possible possible time.  However, once you get beyond 45 or so, in my opinion, you need to be looking for an exit strategy.  Moving overseas, to me, in my opinion, should be one that is a very serious consideration for you.  Finishing, three quick takeaways here.  First, if you're under 25, you heard me clearly, get on a plane, go somewhere.  Even if it's just once.  Even if you've got to take a buddy with you because you're too afraid or you're anxious or whatever to go by yourself, you can do this.  Go try it.  If you're in the United States, you can easily just hop over to the Caribbean in a couple of hours.  Again, you can do this too.  If you're a man over 45, and you know what?  This applies to most men.  You are effed.  you are in deep trouble financially.  You need to make a serious change in your life, in my opinion.  I've done videos about this in the past.  It's going to be up to you to make a decision, but basically you've got two choices.  You can A, work to your 75 and be bagging groceries, or B, you can choose to move overseas at a relatively young age relative to the 75-year-old who's going to be bagging groceries and at 76 dies off.  That's a choice you'll make.  Three, seriously consider what I'm talking about.  Don't get emotional.  Don't start projecting all your anxieties and all your concerns onto me and all other people.  Just think about these as options and ideas for you so you can live the rich life that you deserve.  Gentlemen, as always, hit the like button if you found this useful.  John Galt out. ",
