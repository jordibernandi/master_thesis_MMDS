I'm sorry, but I don't have your place.  No?  You have an idea on me?  For what?  You're being detained right now, sir.  Just understand that.  You have an idea on me.  I already told you.  They came and talked to my supervisor.  Right now you have no right to say, I got caught out here because you're threatening another cashier.  Which one was it?  Let's go.  This is stupid.  Can I get your name and badge number, please?  My badge, my name, sir.  Okay, say it.  Can you state it for the record?  Say it for the record.  My name, my badge.  All right, can you state it for the record, though?  You can see I'm here, sir.  Can you state it for the record, please?  You can see I'm here.  All right, we're asking you to state it for the record.  Yes, Officer Robles.  Can you state it for the record, please?  My number is right there.  So you don't want to honor your oath that you took to the United States?  My number is right there, sir.  It's visible.  My badge number is right there.  All right, we're asking you to state it for the record.  Okay.  Did this guy swear?  What did he say?  He wasn't even looking at you.  What was it that was threatening you?  What?  She doesn't know what we say because he didn't say nothing.  Come on, now listen.  Because I'm black and I'm 6'3\"?  Is that what it is?  Is that what it is?  Come on.  There's no racism.  That doesn't make sense.  How do you not go without pointing that?  And I was 50 yards away from you, 100 yards away from you.  He was pointing towards your direction, but it doesn't mean he was pointing at you.  Come on, man.  There's other people over there.  You're going to do all of this to somebody who's done nothing to you?  Right.  And we went to customer service to get checked.  Like, why are you going to do this to me?  Come on. ",
