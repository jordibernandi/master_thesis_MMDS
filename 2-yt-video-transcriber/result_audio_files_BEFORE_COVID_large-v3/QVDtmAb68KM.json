            "text": ".  .  .  I'm Jessica Smetanovski with The Rebel.  Here in the UK, Tommy Robinson's campaign has moved to Alden, which is a heavily Muslim populated area.  The protesters are behind us.  Police did have to push them back.  They started with throwing eggs and now they're actually going into the bin.  and going into the trash bins, picking up bottles and throwing it to the side.  Oh my God!  The protesters came, probably around 100 of them.  They started on one side, police did block them, and they actually came around the street to another corner, all running towards the rally, throwing eggs, throwing bottles that they're finding in bins lying around in front of the houses.  I even saw them throw some bricks at Tommy Robinson's crowd.  Charlie!  Charlie!  Charlie!  Charlie!  Charlie!  And what's crazy is that I don't see any media here.  I don't see anyone covering this.  You're not going to see this.  You're not going to hear about this, about the aggression from almost definitely over 100 Muslim people pushing, trying to get to this side, throwing bricks, throwing glass bottles at women and children that are here for a political campaign rally.  Looking around, there's women in distress, there's women crying that were chased out of their cars when they saw them come in.  All of this because Jamie Robinson is holding a political campaign rally.  I've been on the campaign since this Tuesday and... Before that, they had no problems with us.  There were protesters at some of the events.  There were some civil protesters, but nothing like this.  This is what happened when Tommy Robinson stepped and told them.  So we just got news that actually somebody got stabbed.  I don't have much information.  I don't know what side escalated the situation, but I am walking towards the crowd.  Step back here.  A kid?  It sounds like a child has actually been stabbed.  Police are trying to de-escalate the situation.  Riot police did show up, and I can tell the protest is dispersing, but it looks like they're actually just going to try another entrance towards the rally.  It doesn't look like they're giving up.  This is not a peaceful protest.  paid protesters with signs.  These are angry, aggressive people looking to cause trouble.  They're not here to protest.  They're here to do something drastic.  Tommy did finish up his rally probably earlier than he intended, but he's worried about how people are actually going to get out of here.  They are surrounded.  There are police everywhere now trying to block the area so no more protesters get close enough.  So we had to get out of there pretty quickly.  Tommy actually had... all the families there.  take all the kids and put them in his van so they can get out of there safely.  we are on the move but i am here in the uk to report on his campaign because the mainstream media wasn't there.  i'm here in the uk to report on tommy robinson's campaign because i don't trust the mainstream media to do so fairly.  to see all my videos and help support independent journalism by helping me pay for my journey please visit tommyreports.com.
