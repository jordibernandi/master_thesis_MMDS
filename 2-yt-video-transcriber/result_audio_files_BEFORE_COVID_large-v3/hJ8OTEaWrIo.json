            "text": "Okay, guys, I have a question for you, and I want you to think about this with your mind for a moment, okay?  What would happen if you were to take a Lady Gaga concert and you were to mix it with like a Cirque du Soleil performance and then put a bunch of half-naked people on the stage, put occult symbolism everywhere, make the people on stage sing Christmas-like music, and then make sure everybody in the room is on LSD when they're doing it?  What would that look like?  Well... I don't know if anybody really has an answer for that, but I could imagine it looking a lot like the 2019 Hillsong Christmas celebration.  Hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  I had a bunch of people send this to me over Christmas, and I never really dealt with it.  I've just been so busy lately, but I just want to talk about it now at this time.  I went through and watched it.  It was just a little while.  It wasn't such a real long thing, but it was about an hour and a half or so.  And so I watched it, checked it out, and really, at this point, nothing from Hillsong surprises me.  I mean, they could come out there and just start sacrificing goats to Moloch, and it wouldn't surprise me.  I mean, at this point, nothing surprises me anymore about these people.  And my position has always been that these people are not Christians.  These people are so... Maybe in the beginning, they thought, well, we're going to try to be progressive and kind of do something different, do something that's, you know... whatever, just contemporary, innovative, but they've gone so far outside the bounds.  I don't even know how you call these people Christians anymore.  I really don't because it's so out there.  It's so bad, and I want to just show you kind of what I see and show you a few video clips here for just a moment.  The first thing, I want to give you three things that I see, and maybe for most Christians, the first two really are going to be meaningless, and we'll just glance over these and just try to talk to you about my third point, which is really my biggest point, and I want you to Just bear with me for a few minutes as I talk about this.  First thing is, number one, the nightclub atmosphere that they put forth in this performance.  I don't like that.  I think a church should look like a church, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  You say, well, what do you do with these people who don't like church?  Well, get them saved and they'll like church.  That's the problem.  You're catering to the world too much.  All right, let's look at this first video together, if we can.  now the first thing that went through my mind when I saw that was like okay any second.  now Val Kilmer is gonna jump off of a building dressed as Batman and start beating these people up.  these people better make sure that they know their stuff because they're about to get it from Batman.  But then I asked the Lord to forgive me because I thought that might be pretty cool to see.  But, you know, I've got to be honest, I don't like that.  I don't like that.  That's not church.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to let you redefine church.  I'm going to tell you that that's not church.  That's not even Christianity.  I don't know what you call that.  I mean, just watch this stuff here that they're doing.  I mean, it looked like unicorns threw up all over the place.  Like I'm waiting for Chris Brown to come out and beat his wife.  I mean, you know, I mean, what's going on?  That's not church, okay?  I'm sorry, it's just not.  Okay, and that made, most Christians will watch that and be like, ah, he just, whatever, he just, that's a preferential thing.  And okay, okay, I'll give you that one, whatever.  But let me just give you the second one that I just, I don't like this.  This is what bothers me, is the half-naked people that you see.  Now I'm going to show you one example of this.  This is kind of like what I call the Cirque du Soleil routine.  I'm sorry, but I just don't like how those ladies are... I would say I don't like how those ladies are dressed, but the truth is they're not dressed.  You know, okay, it's one thing for this to be on the beach.  That's one thing.  But this isn't a church.  And to me, that's just weird.  So I'll just play that for just a moment for you.  This is the Cirque du Soleil routine they're doing.  The carol of the bells.  Now here's another part.  I want to show you.  that to me should matter, but for most Christians it doesn't.  So you've got guys walking around with no shirts on in a church.  And I don't know what they're doing.  They're trying to... be the secular kings of the world, the kings of the East.  And, uh, but I mean, look at all this stuff they're flashing up on the screen.  And I don't, I just, to me, that's weird.  Okay.  That's weird.  I think that people, they will say, well, we're just trying to act out what the Bible actually says.  I get that.  But you know, in a church setting, I just don't like that kind of stuff.  Okay.  Now let me get to you the third point of why I didn't like it.  I thought this was dancing a lot of lines, and I thought it went over the line.  Now, let me show you this here.  This woman was a main singer in this, but throughout all of the performance, it would go to the singers on stage, and it would flash up to the screen, and it would show just the eye, one eye of a woman in a big crown, and it would show a moon.  Um... Y'all, I'm sorry.  I've got a degree in theology.  I've got a vast library.  I've got the Bible.  I mean, I preach for a living.  I teach in two Bible colleges in Kenya.  I have never seen anything.  I don't even know where they're getting that.  Okay?  Biblically, and the problem is they're not getting that from the Bible.  I'll show you what I mean here in just a second.  But watch this.  They're playing this stuff all throughout the performance.  And it's just unnerving.  Watch this.  Whoa.  Okay, so this woman gets up and she's singing and she's got a crystalline voice and everybody just loves it.  You know, making beautiful noises and haunting sounds.  Okay, I'm going to show you what this means and why this is a thing.  I want to just... I'm trying to figure out how to say this to people.  These people are blatantly putting symbolism in front of your face, showing you things that are not Christian.  There is no biblical reference for what they're trying to display here.  I want to show you a screenshot that I took of this this video.  And you notice this woman, she's wearing a dress that's made out of whatever, and she's got a big crown on.  And I thought, you know, I've seen that before.  I have seen that.  I know I've seen... What is that?  See, I mean, religion is my life.  I've studied religions.  I know religions.  And so I thought, what is that?  And I had to go back and do some digging.  Well, here's what this is.  That's a... pagan god called Ishtar and I want to show you a picture of them side by side.  this is not Christianity whatever.  this is that Hillsong is putting on is not Christianity.  now when it's this blatant and this in your face, they may as well just put a red horns and pitchfork on and come out in front of you and just say, hey, this is what we're doing.  Hail Satan.  Hail Lucifer.  But they're not going to do that because they're very subtle and What you're seeing is a fruitation of a spirit that's working through these people.  And that spirit is not the Holy Spirit.  This is the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.  That's who these people are.  These are not Christian people.  Hillsong is not Christianity.  And you think it's all about the music, but it's not about the music.  These people are occultists who have been deceived into thinking they're worshipping Christ, and they're not.  So, I'll just play this for you.  This is Ishtar.  As a matter of fact, I pulled up a Wikipedia article for you just to show you what all this is.  And I want you to see that.  I mean, that's Ayanna, which is also called Ishtar.  The Bible refers to her as the Queen of Heaven.  And... You can check that out in the book of Jeremiah.  Actually, go to KingJamesBible.com and just look up Queen of Heaven.  And that's what this is.  I mean, this stuff that they're doing is this.  Let me just show you this.  It shows Mary has the baby and all these shepherds here.  I want you to see this little video.  This is where this angel pops in.  And just notice this.  Because this is weird.  Okay, that and that.  I mean, y'all, I'm going to let you come to your own conclusion there.  But that's a little off.  If I do say so myself.  Satan manifests himself as an angel of light.  Okay, first of all, let me just say this.  Let's get into angelology for just a minute.  Um... In the Bible, all the angels have a masculine name.  There are no feminine angels.  Matter of fact, angels really... They're never female.  That's for sure.  Now, there's some things about angels we don't really know.  The Bible doesn't go really super and deep as far as all that goes.  But we do know that there are no female angels in the Bible.  I've been dealing with our video, Third Adam, and talking about Eastern religions.  And anytime... Anytime you're dealing with a female deity, a female deity object or something like that, you're always dealing with Satan.  You're always dealing with fallen angels.  You're always dealing with something that is not biblical.  These people, now they're going to claim that we just put up a pretty voice and dressed her up as an angel, but this isn't the story of Christ.  This isn't the story of Christmas.  I don't know what this is, but it's not that.  and you need to know that.  okay so this bothers me and I. I. I'm sorry you pray for me but I just I'd.  I just can't ignore this act like this is okay arm that looks like an Egyptian Babylonian something and that's the.  I'm sorry that is kinda wigs me out.  I'm sorry way out there.  so let's so.  let's go this next video and this is just the the closer that they had.  I'm sorry, but to me that's weird.  That's occultism.  These triangles.  I really... Okay, this is the worst Christmas video I've ever seen, but this would have been the best Christmas video of all time if Val Kemmerer would have come down and had a little spat with these people.  I mean, that would have been amazing.  Because that's what they look like.  They look like Gotham City goons.  What are you doing?  The... Look at the... Look at the one on the left.  Look at what she... Look at what she looks like.  She's like cheesing it up, man.  Look at that.  I'm sorry.  This is goofy.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  If I don't laugh, I'll cry.  Hillsong's terrible.  This isn't Christianity.  This is occultism.  This is Eastern mysticism being masqueraded as Christianity.  They have a different spirit, different gospel, different Bible, different music.  They have different fruit in their life.  And you can say what you want to.  I mean, if you want to go into all that stuff, that's fine.  If you want to go that way, enjoy it.  Have a good time.  But just know that you are... What you're doing is not biblical Christianity.  And what you're doing is not historic Christianity.  This isn't right.  And that should bother you.  So, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a lot of big projects coming up.  Pray for us.  Pray that God would use us in a wonderful way.  Pray that God would have His hand on this upcoming video, The Third Adam.  And we certainly do appreciate you guys.  And we'll talk to you guys soon.  Pray for this channel.  And subscribe if you haven't already.  And we'll talk to you soon. ",
