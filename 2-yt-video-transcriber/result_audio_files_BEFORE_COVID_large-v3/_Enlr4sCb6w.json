            "text": "Yeah.  What I began to see is I was doing the research for the boy crisis and I saw that the boy crisis was in 63 of the most developed nations.  And in those developed nations, boys had two things in common.  They were often products of divorce or they were products of being raised in single mom families without dads involved.  And I found the boy crisis resides where the fathers don't reside.  So I started looking further and saw that this resulted in suicides, it resulted in our prisoners who were more than 90% dad-deprived boys, but it also resulted in the mass shootings.  Almost all the mass shooters were dad-deprived boys, whether it was the synagogue shooter, the Jacksonville shooter, the Steven Paddock in Las Vegas, and so on, and of course the Parkland shooter.  And so I looked at.  the issue of dad deprivation was the single most common issue that created the boy crisis. ",

The boys don't have a role model of a dad.  And boys used to have the sense of purpose of being a warrior or a sole breadwinner.  Now they have a purpose void, and when you have the purpose void combined with the dad void, you have a combination that doesn't allow a boy to discover his unique self or discover how to have a sense of purpose in the world.  But we really have a perfect answer here.  If dad deprivation is the problem, the solution is dad involvement.  The solution is creating father warriors to replace the old soldier warriors. ",

Schools have to be focused more on having vocational education, recess, opportunities for kids to play.  They need to know that projects and getting things for kids to do is very important.  And we have to put the boy crisis on the national agenda.  President Trump, in one minute, could sign an executive order to create a White House Council on Boys and Men and put the boy crisis on the national agenda so that professional associations and groups began to say, what can we do to solve the ten major causes of the boy crisis, but particularly the cause of dad involvement, because the dad involvement is the single biggest cause of the boy crisis.
