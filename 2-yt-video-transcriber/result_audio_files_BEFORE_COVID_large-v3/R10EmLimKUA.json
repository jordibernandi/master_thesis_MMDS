            "text": "Howdy folks, how you doing?  Kel here.  Well, today I thought I'd bring you a little quick review of ENJ XO Brandy.  This is brandy.  It's an XO version which means it's aged.  In the old days it was six years.  Now I guess it's ten years after age to be legally calling it an XO.  Now E&J is not a well-known, snobby brand of brandy.  It is one of the best-selling brandies in the world, I understand.  But let's give this a little try.  I never had the VS, the V8 VS LP.  But this is extremely inexpensive.  A little cup here.  Pour ourselves a little pour.  This is an extremely inexpensive brand.  I mean, it's only $20 for this bottle.  In some parts of the country where they don't have crazy liquor laws like they do in Montana, you could probably get this for $15 a bottle.  I'll confess, I already had a little sip of this.  It's one of the reasons why I'm doing a review.  I was quite impressed.  I still am.  It smells slightly of honey and vanilla, basically.  And fruit, a little bit of fruit.  I'm not a connoisseur of liquor, so I'm not good at telling what smells like what.  But... It's very nice, actually.  Very nice aroma to it.  You know, it's got some legs there.  I just swirled on the glass.  It's got a little bit of legs.  Not a lot, but some.  You know, it's got a nice color.  Kind of a nice golden brown color.  A little darker in the bottle.  But... The flavor is really nice.  I don't know how to describe it exactly.  It's, you know, tastes like brandy, only it's very, very smooth.  You know, there's just mild, probably flavors of vanilla and honey and background of fruit and grapes in there.  But, you know, there's alcohol, of course, so it doesn't taste sugary.  But it is slightly sweet, I think, but it's... A little thick feeling, a little bit, just lightly sweet the way a slightly sweet wine might be a little bit.  Not real sweet.  Not a dessert sweet, that's for sure.  No burn to speak of for the most part.  It's very, very, very smooth.  Not spiky or anything like that.  I think it's lovely stuff.  Like, I may go out on the deck and have a cigar, matter of fact, right now.  I've got a particular cigar I want to smoke today because they're on sale at JR Cigars.  I think I may go smoke a Partagus Amarente.  It translates to the Admiral.  It's like a 48 by 6 inch cigar.  That's very nice.  You know, I hate to say this for such a cheap, you know, kind of a skid row type brandy, but then I never was a snobby kind of person when it comes to things.  I just, you know, smoke and drink what I like.  For a cheap brand of brandy, this is made by Galloway, the Gallow Brothers, I guess.  But for a cheap and expensive brandy, it's really good.  I mean, you know, especially if you get it where you should get it for, like $15 a bottle.  I paid $20 for this.  But that's really good brandy.  And I go so far to say, of all the brandies and cognacs I've been testing on my channel, you know, I've tried, I used to drink Covasi, but couldn't really get through a bottle, but hardly.  I ended up buying a second bottle, and it took me a couple years to get through that because it really wasn't pleasant.  And then I had the Hennessy's VS, which I enjoyed a little bit, but still couldn't quite get through.  I got through a bottle, and I bought a second bottle.  It's kind of buttery tasting.  It's kind of nice.  I'll do a review on that someday.  But still kind of burning going down a little bit, I thought.  Not great.  And the next thing I tried was Hennessy's VSOP.  Which I thought was absolutely fantastic.  Pretty and nice and a real step up.  But I'll be honest with you, as far as drinking goes, I hate to say this, you connoisseurs are going to be pulling your hair out.  But this, I think I would rather drink this than Hennessy's VSOP.  Now, we'll do a comparison on these days.  I do really, really like Hennessy's VSOP.  Hennessy's VSOP is one of the first alcohols I ever had, which actually, after having it, kind of wanted to have it again.  It's kind of like with cigars.  I know a cigar is a good cigar, but I can only recommend what I like personally.  When I have one, and then later on, I kind of want another one.  I kind of think about it.  The flavor comes back and we'll smoke it again.  And that's what this Partagus Admirante, whatever it is, is for me.  I had one a few weeks ago actually on camera in my room.  And I've been kind of wanting one ever since.  I want to see if they're as good as I remember them being.  I have a camera and wrapper, which I'm very fond of the camera and wrapper.  That's my second favorite kind of rapper, actually, underneath the Maduro.  Though, actually, it's not Maduro rappers, so of rappers, Maduro and Cameron are probably my favorite rappers anyway.  But that's when I know I like something.  When I think about having it later on, I'm not having it, you know.  It kind of comes back, and I kind of have a desire to have it again.  This is going to be like that.  I can tell right now.  I want to finish this.  That's how good it is.  It's like a concentrated semi-sweet wine.  The alcohol is, I believe, 40%.  Magnifying glass.  when you get old, start losing your eyesight, close up.  It's 80 proof, 40% by volume.  That's a good alcohol kick, you know?  You know, I mean, that's nice.  And this is 20 bucks.  It's really cheaper than buying wine, which you've been... Spend $10 for a thing of wine, it's 6% alcohol, whatever it is.  So for the alcohol content, it's a pretty good deal, I think, basically.  It's a crazy thing to say, but that's what I think.  Well, that's it.  Thanks for watching.  I never would have thought this was good.  I was watching some videos on alcohol and brandy the other night, and I came across some reviews of this.  I wish I remember the guy's name who was reading my watch, which kind of put me on to this.  But if I think of it, I'll put it down inside the low bar for you.  It was helpful to me.  But anyway, this is very nice.  I recommend it.  If you want to try a good brandy with cigars, this is a good brandy.  It's a cheap brandy.  It's not a snobby brandy.  It's a common brandy.  You can probably find it wherever you live.  But this is good.  I'm going to say, I'm enjoying this more than I've had any other drink I've ever drank in my life.  Kind of crazy, isn't it?  I guess I'm just a pedestrian kind of a guy.  That's nice.  Hey, thanks for watching.  If you enjoyed the video, please give me a thumbs up.  Please subscribe and click that little bell.
