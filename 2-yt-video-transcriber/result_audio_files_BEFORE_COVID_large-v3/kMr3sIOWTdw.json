            "text": "Welcome back to Redirecting.  Now I have a very interesting story.  that is a sad story that I'm going to be sharing with you.  A black female nurse, age 35, killed herself.  The article says that it was the stress of working 12 hour shifts and all of that preventing her from settling down and having a family.  Apparently she hanged herself at home.  It's very sad to hear something such as this.  You look at her, she's a beautiful young woman, had an awesome career.  And what's sad is the fact that she was a mental health nurse.  I'm going to read some of this article and further into the article, I kind of got a glimpse of what could have possibly been the real reason why she took her life.  It says a dedicated NHS mental health nurse, killed herself after the stress of working 12-hour hospital shifts stopped her from settling down and inquest was heard.  An inquest has heard.  Leona Goddard, 35, wanted to have a family but struggled to have a social life after being landed with unpredictable work hours and extra responsibilities.  Although colleagues at Presswich Hospital in Manchester rated her as outstanding, Ms.  Goddard developed low self-esteem due to long hours.  Now, they are saying that she developed low self-esteem due to long hours.  How can they make that determination?  So I'm going to read a little further into this.  It says, Ms.  Goddard was found hanged at her family home by her mother, Corrine Goodrich, on October 3rd, just six months after she got a promotion.  A handwritten note across two pages of A4 paper detailed her negative feelings, a downward spiral, and feelings of self-loathing.  The inquest was told Ms.  Goddard had wanted to work as an occupational therapist, but studied nursing and psychology and graduated at Manchester University in 2012.  A college friend, Danielle Hines said, although she finished the course, she never actually enjoyed the role.  She felt trapped by qualifications and experience.  Leona struggled with shifts she was given and found it difficult to maintain a social life around them.  Now let's go further into this.  It says she was saving money for a house deposit and she was looking for a home she wanted to live in but didn't find anything and it was difficult for her to carry out her search because of shifts she was assigned to.  Over the years, we've had a few conversations, and when she felt at her worst, she would make flippant jokes about pills and wine being her way out.  A doctor's reporter was read to the hearing, which said that Ms.  Goddard had been to see her GP in the weeks leading up to her death.  She says she felt unsupported and had nightmares about work and was offered antidepressants, but she refused, saying if work got sorted out, she would feel better.  Ms.  Goddard's ex-boyfriend, Peter Shaffer, who ended their relationship a week before her death, also spoke at the inquest.  Now, that was the part I was trying to get to.  Her ex-boyfriend, Peter Schaefer.  Now, I have no way of knowing what his racial makeup is, but that name sounds like he might be a Gentile or a white man or a non-black person.  I'll just put it that way.  And it said that she ended their... he ended their relationship a week before her death.  So when you look at all of the stress from her job, from feeling like the job was pretty much just dominating her time, not allowing her to have a relationship or social life, and then you pile on top of that, this man ending the relationship, It says a week before her death.  That was probably the icing on the cake for her.  And so women, you cannot allow yourselves to get to the point, men either, you can't allow yourself to get to the point where someone leaving you causes this.  We have to understand, too, when people... Her friend said that she was joking about pills and wine.  When people get to that point and they're verbalizing this to others, they are really telling you how they are feeling and what they want to do.  They're telling you that they can't take it anymore, that they're tired.  And a lot of times, people just don't believe especially when they look at her life.  She's beautiful.  She had a good job.  I'm pretty sure she's making good money.  She wanted to buy a house, but time wouldn't permit.  Yeah, these jobs can dominate your life.  They really can.  But when you pile on top of that, someone breaking off a relationship and who knows, they said she had feelings of self-loathing.  And so I'm wondering, This is not one of those topics, but it could be.  I'm not making it about this.  I'm wondering if the self-loathing could have been a result of something that was being said to her.  Because many times when a woman develops low self-esteem or she starts to be self-loathing, it's because she's hearing things that someone else is saying to her and she is taking it to heart.  And she can't mentally or spiritually deal with those things.  So yeah, it says that Peter Schaefer ended their relationship a week before.  He said Leona had a wish to have children one day and start a family of her own.  And no doubt she would have been a great mother.  But when she was working for the NHS, there was changing shift patterns and she felt frustration at the unpredictability of shifts.  A new position was offered to give her new skills and responsibilities.  She did want to stay in mental health and the NHS, but in a capacity that would give her more of a social life.  The only reason she stayed in the job that was not healthy for her was a light at the end of the tunnel.  There were many difficulties when she started in the new position and she was left increasing amount of responsibilities, workloads, absence of training, and not long after she was signed off work.  We had long conversations to try to help her find other opportunities, but over the weeks communication was deteriorating and I ended the relationship.  Peter Shaffer ended the relationship because he couldn't support her any longer.  He couldn't be that one that she could depend on.  She was upset and my intention was to give her space and then have a conversation about it.  But tragically she took her own life a week later and that never materialized.  What never materialized?  What the conversation?  Hmm.  Okay.  I'm going to end it right there.  There's much more to the article.  And if you want to read the rest of it, if I remember, I will leave a link to the comment section.  I'm sorry, in the description area for those of you who want to read the rest of this.  But to me, that summed it up right there.  He wanted to end it because I guess he no longer wanted to be a support system.  This is why I say we need each other, black man and black woman.  We need each other.  And when we have to look outside of ourselves to get love and support and understanding, again, I can't say for sure that this Peter Schafer is a white guy, but he very well may be.  If anyone knows or has a picture, that would be great, but I'm only seeing pictures of her.  in my opinion, his response to her feelings and what she was going through were very cold.  And the fact that she decided to end her life a week after the split, that to me is very telling as to being the icing on the cake or the straw that broke the camel's back or the thing that tipped the scale or whatever you want to call it for this beautiful young woman taking her life.  with all the stresses that she already had, having a man that wasn't willing to stick it out, tough it out with her and help her to get through this and to get over that hump.  That's probably what caused her to take such a drastic step.  All right, family, with that I will say shalom. ",
