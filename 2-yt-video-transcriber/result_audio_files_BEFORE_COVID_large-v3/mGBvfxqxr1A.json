If you like what you just heard, you can go ahead and support me on Patreon, which will allow me to raise enough money to record this song and eight or nine others in high quality, and put out a little album.  It'll be really cool.  Thank you all so much for your patience, if you're the kind of person who comes here for the trans-related videos, not the music videos.  I'm currently working on two videos that I didn't really have the time to work on because my band went to LA.  My band also has recordings and shirts and CDs and stuff on Bandcamp now if you want to check that out.  Sounds really cool.  But yeah, I hope you enjoyed the video and I will see you all very soon.  Bye! ",
