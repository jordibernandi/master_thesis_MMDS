You know what?  We could have had a really good conversation with her.  I could have maybe tried to change her mind.  But with liberals and leftists on college campuses, you can tell that that usually doesn't help because they, you know, profanities in your face.  They flip you off.  They have no argument.  They get really shaky and nervous.  And then they walk away.  And she just took a bow for her incredible act right there.  Actually, it wasn't an act.  That's what's sad.
