            "text": "I guess a community watch.  The city of Victorville Federal Correctional Complex, Victorville, California.  We have a base across the street that's now an international airport.  It's got a bunch of abandoned homes for the public park and stuff.  But it's just right across the street from this.  These are security guards coming.  Sir, can't be taking pictures over here.  Sure about that?  What law is that?  Yeah, once I pass there, yeah, I know.  You can.  I got paperwork in my pocket that says I can.  I'm on a public sidewalk.  I'm just going home.  I thought it was kind of odd that it was such a big complex right here, but I don't mean to argue with you, but I know the law.  As long as I'm in a public place, I'm okay.  I have no plans on going on your property or anything like that.  It's a what?  Well, I know, but the same thing as Google Street View or anything like that.  You have a good day.  So I got a big deal.  I think I'm not a security guard.  Way to go.  Hi, how you doing?  Good, how are you?  You're being live streamed on YouTube, just so you know.  Can you tell me what law that is?  Yeah, once I pass that, you're into your property, but can you state the law.  if I'm on a public property?  I can show you.  I got it in my pocket.  This gentleman just stated that I cannot take pictures of this facility, but I'm not in their facility.  I'm a crosswalk right here, crosswalk that way, crosswalk that way, and their property line starts up there.  Okay, are you posted up front?  Okay, I'm not even asking for that camera.  I don't think so.  Okay, just hold on here.  Want to see a paperwork that says I can film you from a public place?  I'm going to go, so you guys have a nice day.  Here's the gentleman.  Yes, I can.  You don't have no authority.  You're a prison guard.  You have no authority over civilians.  You have a good day.  Nice try, though.  Good.  You know you have no jurisdiction out here, right?  I just came to talk to you.  I don't want to talk to you.  No?  No.  All right, no problem.  It's fine.  When the PD comes, they'll teach you guys about the law real quick, and then we'll all be on our way.  I'm on public property.  You have no jurisdiction out here.  If I pass... No, no, I'm just saying so you guys know.  You know, I don't think you guys are very well of the laws, but I have them in my pocket if you guys would like to see them.  Wait until the county gets here.  No, I don't think I'll wait.  I'm going to go.  Thank you.  Almost intimidating, too.  They almost got T-boned, yeah.  Bye.  See you later.  Thank you, officer. ",
