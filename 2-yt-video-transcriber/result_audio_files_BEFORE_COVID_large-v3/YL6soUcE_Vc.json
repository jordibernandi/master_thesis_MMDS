You know, this is my biggest question, and I don't understand why no one is pointing fingers at and actually explaining why Barry Kirscher cut the deal that he cut.  The onus fell on the state attorney's office.  As you know, after the chief of police, Michael Ritter, whom I spoke to at length for many, many years since I started the investigation back in 2009, Ritter said to me many times, I did not accept Kirscher's deal.  He wanted to charge him with a misdemeanor.  No jail time, no restitution.  and no registration as a sex offender.  then he took the case.  ritter takes the case to the feds.  the police chief that's yes.  michael ritter the palm beach police chief takes the case to the feds.  that's when acosta comes in.  that's not until 2006 and so acosta and his team with via fania and others they start to investigate.  that takes two years.  there's a 53-page indictment against epstein but what happens?  well we're getting close to the two thousand eight presidential campaign.  hillary clinton is the democratic shoo-in.  at the time president obama was still not in in the forefront at the forefront and so I believe, given the information that I have and what I've read, that at the very top of the food chain, they did not want to make, as the Attorney General said to me when I interviewed him, Alberto Gonzalez, they did not want to make a political mess.  So they basically tapped Acosta again, which is also why they hired Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz, who were the two... ",

Doug Banz was also on the plane many times.  Many of those times, Clinton had his Secret Service with him, and many times he did not.  Almost every time that Clinton's name is on the pilot logs, there are underage girls.  There are initials, and there are names of many, many girls on that plane.  private plane.  So you have to ask yourself, and this is what I asked myself, why would anyone, not only a former president, fly on a plane 27 times that did not belong to him. ",
