            "text": "The parable of the wedding banquet taught by Jesus in Matthew chapter 22 gives us great insight into the doctrine of election.  Jesus began by comparing the kingdom of heaven to a wedding banquet being prepared by a king for his son.  The king gathered to himself servants, or messengers, to take the wedding invitation first to his own people, and when they refused, he sent the messengers to the highways and the byways, to the good and the bad alike.  so that whosoever may come.  And so the wedding hall was filled with guests.  But the king noticed that one had snuck in without wearing the proper wedding garments.  He was bound hand and foot and cast out where there was weeping and gnashing of teeth.  And so Jesus concluded his parable by saying, Many are called, but few are chosen.  Many commentators and pastors focused almost all the attention on this last choice, the choice of those who are granted entrance into the banquet.  But in fact, there are four choices being represented here in this parable.  The first choice of the king is the nation which he rules, which represents the nation of Israel.  Scriptures indicate that this nation is not chosen because they are of great worth or value, but they were chosen unconditionally, based upon God's purpose and love.  The second choice represented in the parable is the choice of the servants, or the messengers, called to hand out the invitation, first to his own people, Israel, and then to those on the outside of the nation, representing the Gentiles.  These messengers are clearly representative of the prophets and apostles, chosen to take the good news to the nations.  These messengers were also chosen unconditionally, not because of the morality or their worth.  The third choice in this parable is those who would receive the invitation.  The gospel is sent first to the Jew and then to the Gentile.  This choice is also not conditioned upon the morality of those receiving the invitation.  The parable specifically says to take the message to the good and the bad alike.  So these first three choices represent the calling of God through his chosen nation, his chosen servants from that nation, to the good and the bad alike.  But what about the final choice?  Those few who were elect, spoken of in verse 14 of Jesus' parable.  The fourth choice is the choice of those granted entrance into the wedding banquet.  This choice too is unconditional and not based upon the morality or the goodness of the recipient, but instead based upon them being clothed in the righteousness of Christ through faith.  So we have the four choices, the choice of the nation of Israel and the messengers from that nation.  all of which are not chosen because they are deserving or more worthy.  There's also the recipients.  The gospel goes first to the Jew and then the Gentile, the good and the bad alike.  And those granted entrance, again, are not granted entrance based upon their own morality, but upon being clothed in the righteousness of Christ, the right wedding garments.  Some well-intending scholars and pastors have mistaken passages out of the Bible about God's love and choice of Israel to mean that God has rejected and does not love everyone in the world.  The God's choice of Jacob, who became Israel, is not to the neglect of the other nations of the world, It's only that he has chosen Jacob and the nation of Israel to be the seed through which his Messiah and the message of redemption for all the nations would come.  The first century understood the concepts of love and hatred a little differently than we might today.  For example, in Luke 14, 26, Jesus told us to hate our loved ones in order to be a disciple.  But clearly, that does not mean literally to reject them.  It means that we choose God and his ways over that of our parents and our other loved ones.  The Bible teaches that the Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, great in loving kindness.  The Lord is good to all and his mercies are over all his works.  So the nation of Israel is not chosen to the neglect of all the other nations, but instead for their benefit.  As the original promise stated, all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you.  Some also misunderstand God's choice of his prophets or his messengers.  In John 15, 16, Jesus is clearly speaking to his apostles who were individually chosen unconditionally.  But this is not to the neglect of all the other people of the world.  This is for their benefit.  Even God's choice about the recipients who would receive the gospel are often misunderstood by some pastors and scholars to mean that God has granted repentance and faith just to some people, but not to all.  The only choice in this parable which has to do with the individual being chosen for salvation is the last choice.  the few who are elect, and they are elect not based upon their own worth or righteousness, but based upon being clothed by faith in Christ.  One must also remember that a choice that is not conditioned upon one's morality or how good or bad they are does not mean that there isn't a condition for faith in Christ, the one who clothes us in his righteousness.  This is good and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.  For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people.  1 Timothy 2, 3-6.
