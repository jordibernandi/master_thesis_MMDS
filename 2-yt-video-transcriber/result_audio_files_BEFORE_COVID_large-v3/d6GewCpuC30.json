            "text": "Hi, my name is Karen, and I have Down syndrome.  It is not a disease.  It is not contagious.  And you can't catch it from anyone.  It's okay.  I know I am different than you.  I look differently.  I talk differently.  I walk differently.  And I don't hear as well as most of you do.  And I don't see as well either.  And sometimes it takes me longer to learn things.  Now another thing that is different about me is that I can probably swim much longer and much farther than many of you watching this video.  You may be faster than me at the start, but I will outlast you on time and distance any day of the week.  You should know I have some pretty big open water swims on my resume.  like a relay across the English Channel, and a 9-mile nonstop solo swim straight across the width of Lake Tahoe.  Oh, I also like to tell people that I am the first person with Down Syndrome to escape from Alcatraz.  I have done that swim from Alcatraz Island, where the prison used to be, all the way up. ",
