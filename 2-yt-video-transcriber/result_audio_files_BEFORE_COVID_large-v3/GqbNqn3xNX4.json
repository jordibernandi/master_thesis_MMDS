Hey, how are you?  See what I'm saying?  I'm telling you, I get along with everybody.  Sergeant Hansen.  And if I could just go file a complaint and it was that simple, that'd be great.  I would do that.  But I know that's not how it works.  I have to fix it myself.  That means I have to confront him on the street, tell him he's a piece of shit as many times as it takes until he acts like an adult.  And then after that, after that, then we could... Here it comes.  Sergeant hand.  Push record on that fucking button.  Let me get a sergeant's hand.  Am I delaying your investigation, you fucking piece of shit?  Oh, yeah.  Did you capture anything good?  No.  The only reason I'm even out here is because Sergeant Hand is such a disrespectful asshole that I was coming out here hoping he would show up.  I know you're probably concerned now because you're wondering if everything's okay with me.  Everything's okay with me, but everything's not okay with the asshole over there.  So that's where you need to focus your attention.  He's creating problems between your department and the community, right?  So that's not good for anybody, is it?  Okay.  Right?  I don't know what... Well, you know now.  I just told you.  Yeah, I don't know which part you're talking about.  Yeah, well, I just... If you want to... If you... You can watch my newest video.

This whole delaying a police officer, for those of you that don't know, experienced investigators, when they're trying to investigate police for corruption, for criminal behavior, that's how you identify criminal police officers.  It's not a charge... that identifies criminals.  The reason they use that charge against citizens, that's the last resort.  You know how big the penal code is in the state of California.  There's more crimes than you could possibly think of.  Every time you leave the house, you violate some code.  So when a police officer or an agency has to resort to PC 148, that means you didn't break the law.  That means you're an upstanding citizen and the police officer is just bitter and butthurt.  you didn't kiss their ass just the way they want you to.  You know, the video, his behavior speaks for itself.  But my point in saying that is, I faced at least a dozen of these PC 148 charges.  One of them stemming from his department and via mail, who's here, more than 15 days in jail and spent more than five years going back and forth to court.  Even though everybody involved knew I didn't do anything wrong, they deleted their videos and mine.  It's just, it's kind of a sore subject because it's like a joke.  These guys delayed them.  They arranged for you to have years of your life destroyed and wasted.  And they think it's humorous.  I should probably be doing records requests for all the PC-148 arrests from the city of Inglewood.  So I can demonstrate for you and identify all the piece of shit cops that work there.  Because like I said, that's how you do it.  If he's making a perimeter and taping out the public, that's what he needs to do.  Just shut the fuck up, put up the tape, and then I decide how I negotiate around the tape.  He, like so many other useless cops, thinks they don't have to put up any tape, and they'll just say, you go stand by that pole.  I do not stand by anything unless I decide that.  Police don't have the authority to tell a person where to stand.  We're not in elementary school, and if we were, it should be those bitches that do what they're told.  We'll see how the Inglewood Police act in the future.  You know, they're polite, I record, there's no issues.  That this shit will not happen again, not from Hand or not from anybody else working at that department.  It's not fair for me to have to do this, train these ignorant fools one at a time, and they know the difference from right and wrong.  They just think that they can get away with it and it won't matter.  That's yet to be determined.  If they can behave themselves, then it doesn't matter.  If they can't, then it does. ",
