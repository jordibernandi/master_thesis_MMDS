            "text": "hi there.  so this is the first video i've done in about a month and uh i've needed to take a step back a little bit from doing these sort of vlog style videos.  i don't like making them really unless i have something really to say and i go through periods of wanting to be quiet and the compulsion to speak to say what's on my mind is sometimes it's very strong in me and that may be obvious from my previous videos that you know my videos don't really take tons and tons of preparation.  normally it's something which sort of bubbles up from inside me and then I just I just explore what I feel like needs to come out here on the camera with you guys.  But the inverse of that is needing quiet and understanding the importance of silence.  Dramatic pause.  I've really been enjoying doing my interviews.  my focus has shifted to conversations as opposed to stream of consciousness type stuff for the last little while and people have been really enjoying that and I feel that to a great degree these conversations offer something of meaning to people in a way that my vlog videos don't really.  Sometimes my vlog videos can feel a little self-indulgent and when I watch them back I find myself cringing.  I've been told by lots of other creators that this is normal to feel kind of cringy about yourself.  Especially when you listen to yourself back or watch yourself back.  That is totally normal.  But it's an uncomfortable feeling.  And the other thing is that my platforms are growing.  I just hit 30k on this channel.  So thank you everyone for subscribing and being along for the ride here with me.  It's almost been two years now that I've been making videos on this channel.  So I mean I'm just... I'm overwhelmed with the support sometimes that I feel like I'm not an adequate individual to have a platform.  I don't want to just repeat what other people say and be a mouthpiece for other people's talking points.  But the other side of this is that as my channel grows and as my platform grows, I attract a lot more sort of hatefulness, maybe hatefulness isn't the right word.  And people, lots of people out there don't like me.  And that's, that's totally fine.  Normally, I don't let negative comments get to me too much.  But sometimes they do.  Sometimes it's, you know, I don't like, I don't like blocking people.  I don't like banning people.  But at this point, It's it feels like an act of self-preservation because I don't really know Who was going to be spiteful.  who's gonna just like report me or you know?  Try and get a strike on my channel and rather than engaging and giving them ammunition It's easier for me to just ban.  It doesn't feel good though.  Like it sucks the joy out of the channel in a way That you know, I I feel like I. I have to be protective of it because I know, I know at some point, you know, as soon as this channel is noticed, it's probably going to be, I don't know if, if it'll be banned or not, but it seems like people who have, um, you know, been center of like more, more left of center than, than I am politically have been banned.  So I know it's a possibility.  Um, and that, that, You know, I should just be grateful and I am very grateful.  But there is this kind of like creeping dread that comes with the channel growth.  I feel like I can't fully enjoy it in a way because I know every, every so many subscribers is like that much closer to a hit piece or, you know, someone, me rubbing someone the wrong way and them sort of having an ax to grind with me.  suppose these are just.  this is just what it means to be a right-wing commentator.  you know it's just kind of comes with the territory and I'm a sensitive.  I'm a sensitive lady.  I let things get under my skin.  I don't have a thick skin really and it gets me down and sometimes I just feel the need to retreat turn off the camera and just like zip my lid.  because Yeah, it's an immense feeling of responsibility.  You know, that I don't want to be saying things that are wrong or things that are misleading or that are harmful to people.  My dedication is to the truth, but I know I can make mistakes.  So there's a heaviness sometimes with regard to what I'm doing here.  But 30k.  I mean, that's really cool.  I mean, I had to just... pop on here and say thank you to everyone who has subscribed and supported the channel thus far.  it's been wild growing kind of with a community of people in public for the past couple years.  I hope that it continues to grow in a positive direction.  that can be a rising tide which lifts many ships.  um Doesn't silence... I mean, I like my long dramatic pauses.  They... There's kind of a... There's an energetic potential sometimes in pauses.  You know?  Um... everything has a flip side.  you know there's good and there's evil there's light and then there's darkness and there's the creative force.  you know that I often feel that I'm channeling when I speak to you guys unedited here on this channel.  and then the inverse of that is this just this sort of silent pausing that just happens you know and it'll pass and I'll feel the need to speak, I'm sure, again, eventually.  The other thing, actually, that has made me want to pause, I think, is I don't wanna just be this kind of person who's just reeing into the void.  It's tiresome being like, oh, look at this evil, demonic thing that's happening.  Look at this crazy, insane thing that's happening.  Is that offering something good to the community?  I don't think it is.  I think it's just like raising people's cortisol levels and making my blood pressure too high.  That's why I'm kind of switching more towards the internship view style.  I feel like I'm adding something of value more so with those.  And so I have some interesting things coming up in the next, this week and next week for you guys.  So keep your eyes peeled for them.  If you haven't subscribed yet, I've noticed in my analytics that there are a lot of people who watch but who haven't clicked the subscribe button, so do me a favor and subscribe to my channel, please.  Give this very wishy-washy and trademark CC video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it.  I hope everyone's having a great week so far, and I'll talk to you soon.  Take care.  Bye. ",
