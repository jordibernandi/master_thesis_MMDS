He said, my God, what is Rich Little doing at your house, Jimmy?  And Jimmy said, Rich comes by here once a month to get his batteries recharged.  And then another time, another time he told me a funny story about, he said, you know, people, they just drive by and sometimes they come up and wrap on the door.  But he said, one day a family came by in a truck And they got out of the truck and they put a blanket down and then they proceeded to bring out chicken and salad and wine and they had a picnic on my lawn.  And I said, well, Jim, gosh, did you phone the police?  Oh, no, no, Rich, I couldn't do that.  They seemed like nice people.  Well, did you just tell them, please, would you get off my lawn?  No, no, no, I couldn't do that, Rich.  So you did nothing.  Well, not exactly.  I wandered back to the back of the house and turned the sprinklers on. ",
