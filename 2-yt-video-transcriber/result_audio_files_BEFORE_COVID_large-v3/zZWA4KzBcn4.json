We'll get them running.  We're going to be loud with them.  We're going to line it up.  We're going to start giving quick orders, quick, fast orders, very specific.  We're going to ask you as a grown-up what your shoe size is.  The goal tonight is honestly to get them through a process.  We have what boils down to a four-step process.  I'm going to brief them initially, explain their expectations.  You cannot make a phone call right where you're standing on this toe line.  How to talk to us, how to stand, how to act, how to move.  And then we're going to get them in a ditty bag issue where they get their initial PT gear.  So we're going to get them out of their civilian clothes.  We're going to mail them home.  We're going to put them in PT gear so they all look the same.  We're going to height and weight them, make sure they're in standards.  And we're going to get them in for urinalysis.  So that's our mission.  You no longer have personal space.  Welcome to the United States naked.  Everybody's scared walking through the door.  But listen.  Listen to every word that's spoken.  Because the little words are what's going to get you the attention you don't want.  If we tell you to run, run.  If we tell you to stop, stop.  If we tell you to look straight forward, look straight forward.  If we tell you to shut your mouth, shut your mouth.  You need to be able to listen and do what you're told quickly.  Don't just act through fear or stress.  You have to be able to make decisions, listen to input, and do things accurately the first time.  That's going to be the key to success. ",
