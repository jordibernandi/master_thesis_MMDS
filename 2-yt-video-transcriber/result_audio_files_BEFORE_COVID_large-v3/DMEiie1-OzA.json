            "text": "Gold and silver prices showed strength throughout the majority of this week.  The spot silver price is about to close just shy of the $16 an ounce mark in Fiat Federal Reserve note terms.  The gold spot price is closing just under $1,330 full Fiat U.S.  dollars per troy ounce.  This week, our metals and markets format will be slightly different in that I am your host, James Anderson of SD Bullion, and I will not be interviewing anyone.  Rather, we're going to take a brief look around the precious metals industry at some of the latest, most relevant news items for you, the silver and gold interested listeners and viewers.  The major items we will cover are technical resistance levels for gold and silver spot prices at the moment.  Where are they currently?  for those wondering about timing?  What changing Federal Reserve policies may mean for the precious metals to come?  As well, yesterday morning, East Coast time, the largest industry supplier of silver bullion products announced yet another temporary halt of their silver bullion product production.  We're going to examine that story in further detail as the latest US Mint Silver Eagle coin production shutdown just went into effect a mere seven weeks into 2019.

This long term chart we are briefly beginning with is simply the full fiat US dollar gold price since 1970.  Basically it starts from around $35 an ounce gold, moving to where we are today with a gold spot price around $1,330 per ounce.  We are next going to zoom into a 5 year chart so you can see around which and where the technical gold price resistance levels currently stand.  For podcast listeners only, this chart that I'm simply illustrating is the fact that over the past five years, we have been in a gold fiat US dollar spot price trading range with various high points, just below $1,400 an ounce over various times, and a low bottom of around $1,050 an ounce touched in late 2015.  In late 2016, when candidate Trump was shockingly elected as the now head executive of the United States of America, I and others on looking have likely never seen such an egregious comics gold futures sale as the one we saw the night of his election in the following 24-hour time frame.  Basically, when news was confirmed that Trump indeed won, the gold spot price shot upwards immediately, $50 an ounce, only to have the price subsequently fall $100 an ounce within a 24-hour time frame.  This Trump election date in early November 2016, it still remains the record highest gold notional trading volume ever recorded in the comics gold market on a daily basis.  Having longs flushed out, the comics shorts continued to drive the price of gold ultimately down over $200 an ounce by the end of 2016 to around the $1,125 an ounce mark.  I would argue.  this event and simultaneous US dollar strength over this same timeframe, it's allowed the gold market to stay in a sanguine, somewhat polite price range over the past two years or so.  Technically speaking, various experts I trust whose track records have been solid in my experience, they're currently stating near-term gold price resistant levels of $1,360 to mid $1,350 US dollars an ounce, depending on the technical tactics they use.  If we get a weekly or perhaps overnight close above those price points, we will likely see another retest of the more important $1,400 an ounce psychological and last five-year price resistance level.  On the silver side of this equation, we'll start with the long-term chart showing the full fiat US dollar silver spot price since 1970.  Basically starting from around $1.80 an ounce, moving to where we are today with a silver spot price of around $16 per ounce.  Of course, we've had two spike and dive events over this near five-decade duration, both near the nominal record $50 per troy ounce silver price.  And now here is the latest five-year silver spot price chart valued in full fiat Federal Reserve notes.  Overhead technical resistance for silver spot price is sitting currently around $16.20 an ounce, and that's using weekly closes going back to 2017.  One note to take home, typically when gold and silver get bullish with their secular trend price action, gold leads in performance as silver laggards for a while.  Will that be the case this go-round if we clear these aforementioned technical price levels?  What could possibly be the catalyst for all this bullish bullion price action ahead?  Well, this week the Federal Reserve's meeting minutes were released and they are sending a clear communication to financial market participants that their balance sheet reduction program is likely going to end this year.  So in short order, we've moved from a hawkish Fed where raising interest rates to pausing and speaking dovishly about the markets and potentially something even more extravagant to come.  Bottom line to this section of our podcast is this.  In the coming years and perhaps even months, sentiment is likely to change for real.  The markets that have been bullish over this five-year time frame will likely give way to precious metals.  as the Federal Reserve proves it has painted itself into a financial market propping corner.  Given the record debt levels and unfunded liability inputs ongoing, it remains entirely reasonable to expect that the Federal Reserve will not only stop decreasing its balance sheet, but also move into policies where it eventually doubles it or more in the coming decade.  The 2020s continue to look bullish, bullion.  As for industry news this week, the only thing shocking about yesterday's announcement that the U.S.  Mint is temporarily halting 2019 Silver Eagle coin sales was that it took only some seven weeks into this calendar year for it to happen again.  Having been investing and working in this industry since the 2008 financial crisis, I and many of you who are listening have witnessed a few handful of occasions when the US Mint has temporarily suspended its Silver Eagle coin sales.  Durations have varied from a few weeks to many months, some trivial in their effects on the bullion industry.  Others, like late 2008 and 2015, have had large effects on bullion buyers and sellers.  The Silver Eagle coin remains the number one product for high-volume bullion dealers like ourselves at SDBullion.com, and in U.S.  dollar terms, the second-place product's total sales volumes are not even that close.  It's common to see two times the amounts of dollars going to buy Silver Eagles over, say, one-ounce silver rounds or even Gold Eagle sales.  In terms of U.S.  mint data, it's common to see about the same amount of U.S.  dollars chasing Gold Eagles as Silver Eagles as well.  I say all this to make the following point.  Bullion dealer Silver Eagle inventory levels are not exorbitantly low at this moment, but their amounts are numbered.  The US Mint is known to get caught flat footed, and there are many reasons as to why this is the case.  Currently, some of the largest and most easily identifiable market supply constraints for the US Mint Silver Eagle program are as follows.  We've had a slight recent uptick in Silver Eagle coin buying in 2019 versus the last two years.  The U.S.  Mint's quasi-just-in-time delivery nature, basically its refusal to inventory more than the U.S.  Treasury Secretary deems necessary, puts it in a tough position when demand spikes.  And, of course, the usual problems.  Silver Eagle Coin planchette supplier constraints have worsened, with more and more private silver refiner and silver mint bankruptcies over the past few years.  Think of it.  Names which once produced bullion are now gone.  Names like Northwest Territorial Mint, Ella Metal, Republic Metals.  These entities' disappearance from the bullion market, they have real world effects.  It diverts much former silver bullion round and bar demand towards still functioning mints like Silvertown or Sunshine Minting Incorporated.  The Sunshine Mint not only has more demand for its private label of silver bullion bars and rounds as a result of this, it also remains perhaps the biggest silver eagle planchette provider to the US Mint today and for now many years.  You likely see what I'm getting at.  Having worked front lines in this industry in the fall of 2008, I know how silly it is to see an online bullion dealer's website with no products to sell for days, weeks, months, quarters at a time.  How about eight week or more back orders?  How about you?  give us your money now, lock in your price, and you'll get your product in about two months time.  We promise.  That was then in 2008.  And my belief, it's still likely that we're going to see something like that in the coming decade at some point in time.  Probably not this year, nor the next, nor perhaps the one that follows.  But I believe the day is coming.  Most people's only option will be to stick their cash in a derivative and hope it will not blow back on them.  Or pay one of you out there an exorbitant premium on what you might be willing to depart with at the right price point.  But I digress to close over yesterday's US Silver Eagle coin halt from the US Mint.  In the show notes for this week's podcast, I'm going to leave you a blog article I wrote last night on SD Bullion about this exact subject.  My article covers in full detail many of the negative contributing factors ongoing with the silver bullion industry supply side manufacturing.  and how the US Mint's mandate by law to provide gold and silver bullion coins to the public ultimately works.  If you believe that our Fort Knox gold was audited in 2017, or that since this past Christmas Eve's low point and subsequent rebound in US stock market prices was simply free market value buying, Well, you might also believe this same individual now maybe has mastered high volume manufacturing and perhaps alchemy as well.  All the Silver Eagle planchettes we demand and maybe some $1,500 an ounce palladium bullion tonnage will show up in markets en masse.  if perhaps this one individual can make a few phone calls.  Go check out this article and see what I'm referring to.  Thanks for tuning in and until next week, all you out there listening and watching, we'll see you then.  Thank you. ",
