So I know you are an expert on this whole idea of Hebrew Israelites.  And would you just tell us a little bit what or who are the Hebrew Israelites? ",

            "text": "So Hebrew Israelism is this ideology that has two main components to it.  The first is that Black folks who were living in the Western hemisphere that are descendant of slaves, they are the true Israelites.  And then sometimes different Hebrew Israelites will add other ethnic groups to that, like let's say Hispanics as well, Native Americans as well.  But the key component is descendants of Africans are actually the true Israelites.  If they're descendants of slaves and they live in the Western Hemisphere.  The second aspect or component is that lineage, the physical descent, the physical lineage of all peoples has salvific implications.  That means who your dad was matters in the sight of God.  In one of two ways, usually.  They either say you cannot be saved at all, so you're literally part of a non-elect ethnicity, meaning this group of people, Arabs, Asians, Caucasians, those groups of people, for example, cannot be saved.  They're destined for servitude.  The other type of Hebrew Israelites says they can be saved, but they always have to occupy a lower place in the church or the body of God.  So they can't be teachers, for example.  They're grafted in and they have to cleave to an Israelite.  So there's an ethnic hierarchy based on lineage.  Those are the two key components of Hebrew-Israelism, yeah. ",
