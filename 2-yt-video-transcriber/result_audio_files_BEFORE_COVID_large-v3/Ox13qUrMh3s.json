            "text": "What up, Americans?  Jericho Green here with you once again, and the Somali double agent, Ilhan Omar, is at it again.  This time, she's speaking in front of some high school kids and telling them this story about this little old African-American woman who was arrested for shoplifting a $2 loaf of bread to feed her little five-year-old daughter.  Five-year-old.  I said I wouldn't cry.  Five-year-old granddaughter.  And she was arrested.  And I was in the courtroom.  And I couldn't help it.  I just blurted out some profanity.  I couldn't contain my emotions.  How can this room full of educated adults allow this to happen to this poor woman?  Well, somebody got wind of this, did a little fact checking, and it turns out in Minnesota, they don't arrest you for shoplifting unless you have prior crimes, unless you're wanted for other things, unless you've done something else.  Now, never mind the fact that this woman is a piece of shit for not having enough money to feed her grandchild and she has to steal.  This is America.  What the fuck are you doing?  You can get money, EBT, a job maybe.  You don't need to be stealing food for your fucking grandkids.  Where's her mother?  I'm even against free lunch.  That's a whole other video.  But if you can't afford to feed your child in America, you're a piece of shit.  There are too many resources.  We waste more food than some countries produce in a year.  Don't give me that bullshit.  You don't get any sympathy for getting caught shoplifting for some shit you don't need to shoplift.  But she told the kids, you know, she's perpetuating and fortifying that message that this is a racist country.  And if you're colored, they don't give a fuck.  They will arrest you and put you in the system no matter what.  No matter what sob story you have to tell.  and that's fucked up, and that's wrong.  So she says, oh, well, I might have gotten some of the details mixed up, but that's how I remember it.  Bitch, please.  We don't even know if that even happened.  You could have made that shit up.  But you're trying to perpetuate these bullshit lies to these children that this is a racist country, and if you're colored, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter what you try to do.  You're colored.  You're condemned.  That's it.  Fuck you.  How did you bring your colored ass over here?  if this is such a sad, racist country?  If it's so hopeless for colored people, why the fuck did you bring your ass here?  It must not be that hopeless.  It must not be that racist.  You packed your flea-bitten ass over here from Somalia.  You're surrounded by black folks there.  Why didn't you stay?  Because it's a shithole and it's way better here.  That's why you came here.  Marrying your brother, husband, or whatever weird incestual shit you're into.  And why are you there fucking with these kids trying to feed them some bullshit and blow smoke up their asses?  You need to get your shit together in the Democratic Party.  You bitches don't know what's going on.  You, that empty-headed dumb fuck ex-bartender... Rashida Tlalolalib, however her misspelled bullshit name is pronounced.  You better quit messing with Mama Lopan, with David Lopan, I mean, Nancy Pelosi.  You got your own shit fucked up, and you're over there trying to lie to these children?  America is not a racist country.  Are there racists in it?  Yeah.  And I'm going to give you a little breaking news here.  Not all the racists in this country are white.  Some of the most hurtful things I've ever heard have come from other black folk.  Some of the most fucked up shit I've ever heard toward other people has come from people of color.  So stop with that bullshit.  America is racist.  You can't make it in the world.  And no matter what, they don't care.  You're colored, so you're fucked.  If it's so bad, take your hijab, your brother-husband, and get the fuck out of here.  But this country is so fucked up, why did you become part of its fucked up corrupt government?  Why did you become part of the group that puts these people in positions to oppress colored people?  And I'll say it again.  I don't trust Ilhan Omar.  She's a fucking double agent.  And when she wears her hijab on the job, that tells me that your religion is more important than the job I hired your fucking ass to do.  When you're on the clock, put that shit away.  You work for me now.  Or you work for the people of Minnesota.  The people in little fucking Mogadishu, wherever the fuck you're from.  Stop lying to these fucking children.  Stop telling them that this is a racist, terrible country.  Why don't people see that?  If it's so bad, why do they keep coming here by the millions?  Why do you pack everything you own into a fucking duffel bag, put on your t-shirt of a Super Bowl team that didn't win, collect fucking milk jugs, and float your ass over here?  Or pack some fucking sopes and tapatio and trek across the fucking desert if it's so bad?  Bitch, please.  You need to focus on the district you come from because it's number one in terrorist recruitment in America.  Fix that, bitch, before you lie to those high school kids.  Now that my blood pressure's through the damn roof, I'm out of here.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.
