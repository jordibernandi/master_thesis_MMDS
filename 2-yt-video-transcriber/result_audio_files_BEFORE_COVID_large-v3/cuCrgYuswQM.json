            "text": "Let me do something real quick since I have a glass here.  This is obviously a glass, but if you were to go like this in an eighth grade physics book, what they're going to describe this as is an oscillating system.  And most people think that an opera singer or anyone that can duplicate this and bust it is breaking it because it's glass.  They're not.  They're breaking it because it's an oscillating system that they found resonance in.  And this is the fascinating thing about sound.  You can destroy things with sound waves, proven fact.  All you got to do is find resonance.  Once you find resonance, you drive it at amplitude.  And an oscillating system is described as a swing set in like an eighth or 10th grade textbook.  It may be 12th grade by the time you see this.  Education is going so far downhill.  But in physics, these are all oscillating systems.  And what Whitaker taught me, a guy named Bob Whitaker long, long ago, this is what he specialized in.  This is one of the reasons he was allowed to operate in Washington and be so right-wing, is there is a resonance effect when it comes to something what you think of as memes.  If you can ping this, you can destroy it.  And he sat around for years developing memes.  what most people think of as the white genocide mantra.  But what they don't know is there's hundreds of other mantras.  In their type of oscillating system that our enemies built, and this is the key point, they're closed systems.  They're just like the Soviet Union.  A closed system can oscillate, but it can only oscillate under certain laws of conservation.  And the laws of conservation in this particular system are white.  people are not supposed to talk about certain things.  And as long as white people don't talk about certain things, everything goes okay.  It can go on forever.  Well, what we want, and we want to take that swing set, we want to take this glass, if you will, we want to destroy it.  We want to shatter it.  And so we walked around pinging for years.  He's pinging the glass, trying to find it.  Words like replacement, displacement, the JQ, all the stuff that we weren't supposed to talk about because all you have to do is find resonance.  All you have to do is find the ping.  And if you find it and you can build an audience, once that breaks it's not.  obviously we're not breaking a glass but the political structure the political dialogue is going to fracture across the board and all the particular issues that are important.  come rushing in now.  typically in that type of environment you're terrified because you need people to talk about all these different issues.  in the soviet union.  the big problem they had when that came down is no one knew anything about any other type of economics And that allowed the neocons to come in and take advantage of the situation.  In our case, we didn't care.  Bob was just trying to find resonance.  Where is this thing going to ping?  What meme is going to set it off the conversations?  What's going to get it going?  Because once it breaks in America, when it comes to the JQ, crime stats, traditional or critique of feminism, you name it, we have all the heavy hitters, all of them.  all of them.  so we were only worried about pinging it and that's what we i believe he found with the white genocide stuff.  it started pinging.  i was convinced of it.  and but when it comes to memes the reason i went into that little demonstration Once you start pinging it, once you find resonance, once you start repeating it, once you start the repetitions, the cycles start.  It's one person.  It's two people.  It's 100 people.  There's a resonance effect in this type of closed system because it's closed.  We're all in a glass bubble.  And eventually, it just starts exploding across the board.  And now you have the contextual pro-whites, the contextual anti-Semites.  You have all this going on at once, and they're trying to control it.  They can't.  can't?  it doesn't matter.  the whole thing's already shredded.  it's like trying to drink out of a glass that someone's already blown up.  they realize it but they don't want to admit it you know and they're going to do as much damage from here to there as they can.  people are looking at these memes at facebook and this is how it works and saying okay this is banned and they're looking at it's okay to be white.  they're like what the that bad.  what's going on here?  i mean you're asking me to police.  it's okay to be white.  you're saying it's not okay to be white.  really again we come back to square one.  if it's not anti-white it has to be banned.  you know we got too many of the white people knowing too many are figuring out the game and you've got to stop this geometric progression very quickly.  they didn't do their jobs.  in my opinion they might wreck us all before it's over with those that speak out in the open But this is the end game.  Or they may do something crazy.  I'm always amazed how online culture has influenced the actual mainstream media.  And when you're watching Tucker Carlson, this is the funniest stuff.  I've done a show on this stuff on Red Ice, more from a propaganda angle than truth angle.  But he's doing specials or he's doing bits on UFO stuff.  Do you see this, Henrik?  No, I didn't.  Oh, really?  When was this?  He's like, you know, most news companies, most newscasters steer clear of UFOs.  They're afraid of UFOs.  You're on Fox News, on Tucker Carlson.  We're not afraid of it.  And he goes into the New York Times article and this and that, you know.  I just thought it was hilarious how much online culture has influenced the regular news.  Now, Tucker Carlson 10 years ago would have never touched that stuff, but now he will.  New York Times doesn't normally write about UFOs.  So if they're writing about UFOs, everyone's permitted to write about UFOs.  Here's the thing.  Let me give you an example.  There's a new show or newer show on some cable channel called American Gods because I track this thing.  I saw a little bit of this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, here's the thing.  You have this piece of AI who looks human, but it's actually AI talking about normies.  Normies.  Now, where does this language come from?  Y'all right?  4chan?  Yeah, exactly.  This stuff has taken over.  Our side used to say, you know, the only thing that matters is the real world, IRL.  And that's fine.  But before you hear something like rap music bouncing up and down the street, you hear it on the TV or the YouTube or anything else.  The tail wags the dog.  Media is a very, very big deal.  In the online culture, we own the Internet.  Everyone knows that.  We've known it for a long time.  The ideal that you can kick out a particular meme, we had on the fellow behind It's Okay to Be White, one of the original ones.  I heard that one.  It was a good show.  Yeah.  I call him a meme star.  This is a young guy who actually surprised me because he told me, I've heard a couple of shows and watched the animations.  This kid's listened to everything I've ever said five times.  He didn't tell me that, and he's like springing rabbit language on me.  Wasn't ready for it at all.  With that being said, these guys can kick out a meme, run it down 8chan, 4chan, and have it all over the planet within hours.  It used to take us... days and months of building.  No sooner than a narrative comes out on something like Christchurch, some big tragedy.  The counter-narrative online, within hours, multiple shooters.  And this just astounds me how fast this is.  It's not a 72-hour counter-narrative.  It's not like the 72-hour media cycle.  It's like 30 minutes, an hour.  And these are big channels pumping out this stuff that all go against... the establishment narrative in every way shape matter or form.  i always say anyone that's against the establishment is always put into the alt news bracket and they've done this for years and it was a stupidest thing to do.  it's true.  it was yeah you know because you have a lot of people on this planet that disagrees with the people in washington and london and tel aviv and brussels.  you know.  it's just really ridiculous it's true.  Thank you. ",
