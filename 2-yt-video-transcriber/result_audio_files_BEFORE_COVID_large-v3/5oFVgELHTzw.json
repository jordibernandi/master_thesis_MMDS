I'm always really skeptical of mainstream media, so... I'm expecting it's going to be pretty chill for most of the city.  Check out the front, it's crazy up ahead.  As you can see it's pretty busy but it's still peaceful and calm and that's what I like about China, it's always pretty peaceful.  It is absolute madness here.  There's just thousands of people.  And like I said, it's just super peaceful.  Even though there's so many people, it's just all working, you know?  It all works out.  Everyone gets to where they need to go.  No problems.  So I'm kind of worried when I get to Hong Kong.  Is it going to be a totally different vibe?  Like really aggressive, really like in your face.  I'm just used to the peacefulness here.  It's calm.  Guys, I'm getting on the train right now.  Let's go.  Just arrived to Hong Kong.  So many cameras.  Well, it is an international border, kind of, so it makes sense.  Foreigner.  Sorry, I gotta fill out some forms.  Hey guys, I'm at West Kowloon Station right now and everything's chill.  No riots so far, no protests, so let's find that shit.  Let's see what's happening.  Alright, I gotta get on the subway first.  This station is pretty sweet, man.  Pretty freaking sweet.  I love train stations.  I love the high-speed train stations in China.  They're so cool.  Look at that ceiling, oh my gosh.  It just gets cooler and no one ever looks up there.  But yeah, it's cool.  Hey guys, so I made it to downtown Hong Kong.  This is Central.  Really nice shopping as you can see.  Top notch.  All the brands pretty much.  What do you got back here?  What's behind me?  Mont Blanc.  Mont Blanc, a French brand.  Yeah, everything is nice and peaceful and quiet.  Kinda how I expected it.  That's what I know of Hong Kong and it's still the same.  But I think it's a Friday afternoon.  I mean, the weekends is where things kick the fuck off.  Yeah, I'm walking backwards right now for you guys because I want you to see the view.  It's literally nothing here around the IFC building.  Let's try to find some stuff maybe towards that area with all the high buildings.  This is gonna be hard, guys.  Hong Kong is just a quiet place right now.  I can't even find people walking around.  It's going to be hard to harass someone.  Can I interview you?  So I am at the Legislative Council right now.  And you can see they have these huge barriers because they're getting ready for the radical protesters.  You've probably seen this place on the news.  I'll turn around for you.  I think you've seen clips from the news where they throw Molotov cocktails over the fence.  There it is.  And there's some beautiful graffiti for you right next to City Hall.  I'm going to go to Lan Kwai Fong.  That would be a fun area.  I've only asked four people, but no one really wanted to do it.  I'm just wondering if there's a reason for that.  No one wants to?  Get on YouTube.  Get on the YouTube, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because YouTube is, yeah, to me, okay.  Is there some kind of protest happening?  I can go see it? ",

It's autumn, so it's not too hot.  September 20th today.  And we're going to see if we can find some of these people.  Heard they're singing.  Okay, I just had a nice chat with a lady and she said a lot of people are silent and they don't want to talk on camera because they're worried that people are going to hurt them for expressing their views, especially in Central because a lot of people don't support the protests in Central.  So yeah, no, there's really a culture, not a culture, like a fear.  There's a fear right now and a silencing.  So it's very interesting.  I didn't expect that.  And that's what a lady just said.  Very nicely dressed lady.  But yeah, in Central, I think she's called it the silent majority.  She said people are not willing to go on camera to say things.
