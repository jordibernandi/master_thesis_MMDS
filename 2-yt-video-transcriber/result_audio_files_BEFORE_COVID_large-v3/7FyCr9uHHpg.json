            "text": "This is not public again.  Who pays his salary again?  This is not public.  Yes, it is.  All right, let me ask you.  Please don't touch me here.  Please don't touch me.  Please don't touch me.  Thank you.  How's it going, dude?  Hawaii.  Information is straight ahead.  That's what y'all looking for or y'all lost?  No, we just want to come in and look at the public lobby.  Your name and badge number, sir, please.  It's right here.  No, I'm saying.  Seriously.  No, it's not actually.  It's right here, though.  Do you know that the thin blue line is a desecration of the glass?  No, we want to take some pictures of the lobby.  Why are you touching me?  It's a police department.  It's a public lobby.  You can't put your hands on me.  You can't walk in my office.  This is a public lobby.  You can't touch me.  Unless I commit a crime, you can't touch me.  That's a police department.  This is public.  Hey, let me talk to you.  This is public.  It doesn't say private here.  This is public.  Guess what?  You're a sellout.  You're a sellout.  That's a white power symbol.  Yeah, you are.  You're a sellout.  You don't care.  You just kiss the ass of your masters.  I'm recording you too, yeah.  How does it feel to kiss the ass of your masters and play on your phone?  You're a sellout.  You're a sellout.  So because you're recording, you think you can just run your mouth, right?  No.  Okay.  And be disrespectful?  This is not public.  Again.  Who pays your salary?  Again.  The First Amendment says I can be disrespectful.  Yes, it is.  All right, let me ask you.  Please don't touch me here.  Please don't touch me.  Please don't touch me.  Let me ask you a question.  The First Amendment says I can say whatever I want.  Let me get this right.  You guys have no life, so you walk around and just bother cops?  No.  No life.  You have no life.  Let me ask you a question.  Does Amtrak police take funds from the public?  No.  Really?  Seriously.  We actually looked this up.  You guys get a lot of money from the public.  We get money from the public?  Yes, you do.  For what?  I don't want to talk to you.  You guys get public funds.  You can't beat me.  You're not intellectual enough to beat me in a debate.  Hey, but are we being detained?  Do you know what you're talking about?  I'm asking you.  Well, we could be detained.  All right.  Making a scene with cameras and all that, you can record all you want.  All right.  But making a scene, you walking up in my face, that's disrespectful.  No, no.  I just tried to ask.  No, stop.  Stop.  Let me finish talking.  Okay.  That's disrespectful.  You're walking in.  It's okay to be no longer being disrespectful.  Let me talk.  Let me talk.  I was respectful at first.  No, you wasn't.  Yes, I was.  I just wanted to go into the lobby.  Let me talk.  I said I wanted to go into the lobby.  That's not the lobby.  What are you talking about?  It's a police lobby.  Yes.  It's a police department.  It's our police office.  It's not public.  It's private.  So if I want to go in there and ask questions to Amtrak police... No, I'll come out to you like I did.  I don't understand why you... You came out very aggressively, though.  No, I didn't.  Yes, you did.  It's all cameras.  Yeah, I know.  It's going to be online.  Yeah, she works in the station.  You guys have no life.  You're just walking around.  You're assuming.  You're assuming.  But you don't even know us to say that.  You have no idea what we're doing.  You walked up with a camera in my face already.  There's cameras everywhere.  You walked up and just asked my band's number for no reason.  I told you it was right here.  You walking up on me... I didn't want them on you.  Y'all in my face saying racist shit like that?  I didn't say racist shit.  It is.  What did I say that was racist?  Barman is a bitch.  I want you to record that.  What did I say that was racist?  Slave masters and shit like that.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's on camera.  It's.  That's what you want to call it.  Who's your master?  I do myself.  You got your own business?  I don't answer to nobody.  You got your own business?  Doing what?  Actually, I have a non-profit and I run two radio shows.  Radio shows?  What's up, Michelle?  I don't answer questions.  I can't look you up?  I want to look you up.  Oh, you can.  What's the name of it?  It's Demand the Truth.  You can see me introduce CIA whistleblowers.  So it's on YouTube?  No, it's also on a radio station, too.  I'm going to look it up.  It's on YouTube.  It's on YouTube.  I'm being serious.  Come on, check it out.  What's the name of it?  Auditing America.  Auditing America, check it out.  He's wrong.  Amtrak police does get funds from the... Actually, I'm going to look it up right now.  Yep, $2 billion in federal funding.  $2 billion, right?  I knew it.  For what year?  That was during Trump's presidency.  Trump cut it down, but there still gets that much.  All right, so Auditing America.  All right, look, you didn't even know this, but look, Amtrak gets $2 billion.  This is USA Today.  This is USA Today.  This is a reliable source.  Everything's on Google.  This is USA Today.  This is actually a fact.  Bro, first off, stop using that word.  Why?  I'm like, you're being real disrespectful.  You're being very disrespectful.  I'm really not.  Yes, you are.  Like, you keep using that word.  You just cut it out.  Like, you're a girl.  How old are you?  I don't expect it.  Of course.  Well, you guys do get $2 billion from the... Actually, it's gone.  It's called Solemn Mode.  We don't have that.  We're not in YPD.  It's called St.  Campbell's.  Bro, you going to tell me how to work my camera now?  Yeah, because I got one too.  It's different ones.  It's different ones.  Y'all really need to get a life, man.  Really?  This is probably your job, to walk around and just fuck with cops.  And I bet you several of us here probably make more money than you do.  I doubt it.  Really?  How much do you make a month?  That's probably none of your business, but I doubt it.  Well, actually, it is.  I can't even find your radio station.  It is our business how much you make because it's actually public records.  We can actually look that up.  So look it up then.  I'm stupid?  Look it up.  You tell me then.  Well, I do think you're stupid because if you have that thin blue line, do you know what the thin blue line represents?  Do you?  Yes, I do.  Doesn't mean what you just said.  What does it mean then?  Please let me know.  You know, it's funny because a guy came through before.  I would love for you guys to meet.  He says the complete opposite.  Really?  That's funny.  So I guess you got your own opinion.  When the government displays... uh uh the united states flag and alters the colors and it's just a question of the flag and and it's a you.  no no it's.  no that's your opinion.  no it's under the flag code.  it's under the.  yeah it's a violation.  it's a violation of flag codes.  i'll show you right now.  i'll show you that right now because what that means whether you want to admit it or not is that means you're kissing the ass of the cops more than the general public and you're desecrating the flag.  and i'll show you right now just to prove my point yeah okay yeah so you you.  so you care about the thin blue lines.  you know police officers are eight times more likely to kill somebody than terrorists So you sleep easy at night.  Sir, we just wanted to take some pictures over here.  He was extremely rude.  Take some pictures, my boy.  Whatever I want.  All right, we got it.  We're good.  And we also were telling them about the Thin Blue Line, which is a desecration against the flag code.  It's a violation of the flag code.  It's a violation of the flag code, and I find it really disrespectful.  My grandfather, both my grandfather in the service, my great-grandfather fought the Japs in World War II for that flag.  It's pretty disrespectful to call them Japs, by the way.  That's fine, but he fought them, and you're just desecrating the flag that he fought for.  So I think that's actually more disrespectful.  Okay.  It's part of our policy that we're allowed to wear.  Okay, that's cool.  We went through.  That's cool, but it's against the flag code.  It's a desecration that people fought for.  So you're okay with that?  It's your opinion.  No, it's a fact.  It's against the flag code.  It's not my opinion.  It's an absolute fact.  What can we help you with, though, today?  Well, I want to take pictures of this lobby.  Of the public lobby, yes.  There were civilians in there.  It's not a lobby.  It's not a lobby.  That's where we take reports.  Why were there people in there?  To take reports.  Okay, but you guys, do you guys get public funds?  We just wanted to take pictures of the lobby, working on the story.  It's not a lobby.  It's a report room.  Okay, so can we take pictures of the report room, please?  Yeah, I'll let you take pictures.  Thank you.  That's all I wanted.  Thank you, sir.  Okay, no problem.  Thank you.  Yeah, I got to buzz in.  Okay, thanks.  What's your name and batch number?  Sandor, 563.  Thank you so much.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, we were just trying to inform him that Amtrak receives almost nearly $2 billion from public funds.  He's saying it's private.  Okay, are we good?  No, I mean, I can stay in here as long as I want.  I just wanted to make sure that you were good.  Guess what?  Sir, guess what?  The First Amendment is... I'm about to leave, but I want to tell you, the First Amendment isn't about the weather.  It's about controversial speech.  We pay for this building.  Keep going on Grindr, buddy.  Are we good?  Now we're good.  Now that he knows that we can film in here.  Thanks, buddy.  Have a good day.  Now you learned something.  Okay, so... Do I have to leave?  Well, yeah, we're leaving.  We're leaving.  And he's doing a report.  But this is not like a public... No, this is a report room.  This is an office and a report room.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah, that's all.  All right.  No problem.  You can take as many pictures as you want, but it is a report room.  Thank you.  I appreciate you letting us in.  It is our office and a report room.  And we do have pictures of domestic violence and very personal things that go in there.  Of course, and this would be a private room.  Unfortunately, this is one of the most private places we have in this station.  Well, you know what?  Our tax money should be going to something better than that.  But I appreciate you allowing us to go in there.  Unfortunately, it took us a while.  You're very professional.  Honestly, I think you should, if you're going to put a flag there, put the American flag.  Yeah.  You know?  I would appreciate that.  I'll take that under advisement.  Please.  Just because a lot of people, you know, the police are eight times more likely to kill you than the terrorists, and people are seeing that as like a gang thing, we just want you to realize that you represent the American people and not the thin blue line.  Okay, thank you.  All right, have a great day.  Thank you.  Bye. ",
