We're going to blame and rage.  And that when we do that, blame and rage becomes anger, and that's all part of the pain that we're all experiencing.  That's fear.  Fear leads to terrorism, you're saying, that we're all deeply afraid.  You know, one of the other big shocks, I guess, from the research for me was looking at these two tracks of research that we see emerging across the world globally.  One is we are more sorted than we have ever been in the history of the U.S.  We have built ideological bunkers.  We are more likely now to live with, worship with, and go to school with people who are politically and ideologically like-minded.  Mm-hmm.  You would think a natural result of sorting ourselves into these factions would be closer ties, more connection.  But as it turns out, as sorting grows, so does loneliness.  So we're becoming more lonely as we're becoming more balkanized. ",

Sometimes it was a major difference in how they interpreted the Bible or viewed the Scriptures overall.  But the most prominent and the most influential of all the various sects were the Pharisees.  That's one of the reasons why we find their reference repeatedly in the Gospel accounts.  They had really come together and formed organizationally, you might say, about a hundred years before the time of Jesus.  And they were in their own era, their back to the Bible, a revivalist movement.  They saw the influences of Greek and Roman culture upon the Jewish community and decided that they needed to really make a stand for God's truth.  They began to emphasize the study of scriptures in particular.  Because when they looked at Judaism historically, the source of all their problems as a nation had come when they had become distant from God's truth.  In other words, they relied upon the rituals and what we would call the cultic dimensions of temple worship.  and the rituality of their faith, but didn't really know what the scripture said.  And so they brought in this tremendous emphasis upon the reading of the scriptures, and their life was consumed with observing these kind of minute details, because they thought that was the key to getting to heaven.  Even their name bespoke of how they viewed themselves and how other people tended to view them.  It literally means the separated ones.  The idea that they had separated themselves from the pollutions of the culture, especially of the Gentile cultures, the Greek way of life, the Roman way of life.  They were separate from that, yet in their passion for the Word of God.  they overlooked the one thing that Scripture tells us matters the most to God.  In fact, Jesus, in commenting about their carefulness, their circumspection with tithing, he said, you have neglected the more important matters of the law, which are justice, mercy, and faithfulness.  You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.  In other words, he says, the fact that you're tithing, that's great.  But in doing so, you've completely forgotten about what really matters to the heart of God, that you operate in justice and fairness and uprightness and honesty, that your character is one that's above reproach.  that you are merciful to other people instead of being judgmental or critical or fault-finding, and that you essentially are faithful to God in the things that matter to God.  You see, the Pharisees' problem, and this is where Jesus goes in this conversation, was not in how well they kept the law, but in the fact that they did it externally and completely overlooked the idea that God was looking internally.  Or as one of the old passments, what Jesus himself said to them.  in Matthew 23, he says, \"'You clean the outside of the  cup.'\"  but left the inside full of greed and self-indulgence.  You look beautiful, whitewashed tombs on the outside, but on the inside you're full of dead men's bones. ",

What happens is if we allow it to begin to become rooted in our life, we'll begin to nurse it just like a plant in our nursery.  We'll begin to water it.  We'll begin to fertilize it.  We'll begin to feed it and say, oh, yeah, and they did this, and they did that.  I can't believe they did that.  And look at the way they are right now.

Any evil thing that's said about it, you immediately believe it because you've determined in your heart.  you want to think the worst of it.  Number two, we can break this command when we speak to other people only about their faults.  Listen, to have that kind of attitude is to be judgmental in a way that Jesus addressed here.  We break this command when we judge an entire life by its worst moments.  Think of the three worst things you've ever done.  How would you like your entire life to be judged in light of those three worst things that you've ever done?  Don't we do that to other people sometimes?  No, instead, what Jesus speaks to is how Christians should be towards others, how his disciples should be, and the way that they should assess and look at the lives of other people.  Friends, the Christian is called to show unconditional love, but we are not called to show unconditional approval.  We really can love people who do things that the Bible does not approve of.  It is really possible to love a sinner and to hate their sin.  Respect that.  Did you know that it is entirely possible for you to respect somebody you disagree with?  And Christians need to show that.  Christians need to show an attitude of love, honor, and respect to people that they disagree with.  Now Jesus is going to illustrate this principle.  Verse 3, he says, And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eyes, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?  Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the speck from your eye, and look, a plank is in your own eye.  Hypocrite!  First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.  Here Jesus used an intentionally funny illustration.  He doesn't mean that literally.  He's using it just to be memorable and funny.  He's not speaking literally about somebody who has a board in their eye.  You get the illustration.  Now notice this.  Jesus did not say that you're prohibited from caring about your brother's speck.  Maybe your brother really does have a speck in their eye. ",
