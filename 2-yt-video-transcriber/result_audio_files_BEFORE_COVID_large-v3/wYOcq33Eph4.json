It's time for Wednesday's episode, the next part of the TRBR interview.  He's talking about Michelle Obama and all of the rumors that she's a man.  And so I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time prefacing this, but everybody knows that, you know, Joan Rivers made the statement.  They asked her if we would ever have a gay president, and this was during the Obama administration.  And she said, we already do, said Michelle is a tranny.  And after that statement, she, under mysterious circumstances, died during a procedure that she should not have died while she was having done.  So without further ado, we are going on to the portion of the interview where TRVR talks about Michelle Obama.  I'll come back at the end and wrap up. ",

They're just well known to people.  To people in the know, I guess you could say.  Things that people don't even argue about.  Some things that people might find interesting.  One thing that I always thought was just silliness that just will not go away is the debate about Michelle Obama.  that she is actually a man.  And believe it or not, there's actually many people and high ranking people in the know that I trust and believe that honestly 100% say that is a fact.  And like I said, I still find it hard to believe, but it just will not go away. ",

He's talked to some high-ranking individuals about this, and he said he finds it hard to believe, and I guess he doesn't really want to believe it, he said, but you can't just put it out of your mind.  So there you go.  Y'all have a good Wednesday afternoon.  And tomorrow, on Thursday, I'll give you a preview of Friday's episode and combine it with, you know, Funny Fridays.  And that'll be the last part of the interview, and hopefully in a few months I'll get to interview TRVR again.  So y'all have a good one, and I will see you Friday.  When trouble is coming your way.
