            "text": "Bible Answers with Dr.  Al Garza.  Alright, welcome back to Bible Answers Podcast.  Today I'll be discussing something that's a little bit controversial in topic.  Now, we're going to be discussing inerrancy.  The biblical understanding of inerrancy, infallibility, the inspiration, all those things that we discuss as believers regarding the Old Testament and the New Testament.  Now, this is going to be a little controversial because I do have my position based on all my research.  And it might not be yours, your belief, your conclusion, but this is mine.  And it has, to me, little to do with whether or not someone is a Christian or a believer, a true believer.  in regards to if you believe the New Testament, the Greek New Testament is the inspired inerrant word of God.  And it all depends how you define inspired.  It all depends how you define inerrancy.  So that determines as well what you are pushing forth in your teaching or your belief.  Now, if you If you're someone who believes that the Greek New Testament is the inspired and errant word of God, then again, the question goes to how do you define both those terms?  Because we could talk about areas of theology, areas of teaching, doctrine within the Greek New Testament, or even in any other translation in regards to those areas of Latin, Coptic, Syriac, the German, the English.  We can discuss those things as well.  But how you define it, if you keep it within those parameters of doctrine, theology, teaching.  then yes, we could discuss the overall gospel message, that that is considered, in a sense, an error in itself, the infallibility of the teaching.  as far as consistency in regards to what the message is, then we could all agree on certain errors.  But if you're talking about grammatical errors, small nuances, or even some of the things of shorter-ending gospels or shorter-ending letters and so forth, or words, Maybe that wasn't there.  or specific, you know, verses that maybe are not there in older or earlier manuscripts versus later manuscripts.  Those are all debatable.  But those things does not take away of who you are in Yeshua, Jesus as a believer.  Now, for me personally, you know, I believe wholeheartedly in the authoritative preservation of the scriptures, both the Hebrew scriptures and, of course, the New Testament in translation.  Because I hold, in all my research and academic studies and research independently, my position is clear.  I believe the Greek New Testament is a translation.  And translation.  in respect to that we know for certain that Yeshua's mother tongue was Hebrew.  He spoke to his disciples in Hebrew.  He spoke to the Pharisees and the rulers, Sadducees, in Hebrew.  He told his parables in Hebrew.  So when you're reading him in Greek, you're getting a translation of what he said.  they're not the words he actually spoke.  And we know this, you know, without debate.  And you can look at my other videos where I quote the scholars in Israel regarding how we know that Yeshua spoke Hebrew and that he did not speak any other language.  Being a Hebrew Jew, he was not a Hellenistic Jew.  He was not a Greek Jew.  He was a Hebrew Jew that spoke Hebrew.  We don't have any other types of parables or writings in any other language other than Hebrew.  from rabbis and teachers of the first century.  And that would be Yeshua Jesus also himself, since he was a rabbi.  Not only just the Son of God, but a rabbi.  So, we're still looking at the Greek New Testament as a translation, just like we look at the Latin as a translation, or the Coptic, or the Syriac, or any other, the German, the English.  They are translations.  They are preserved translations.  They are preserved and authoritative translations.  I would definitely agree that they do have authority and the being in the translation, but inerrant or inspired.  i would not hold the translation being in that category.  the hebrew scriptures are copies going back to an original hebrew.  they're not a translation.  so we look at the hebrew old testament we can look at from the dead sea scrolls.  we can compare the copies of the hebrew even into the the lippo and the leningrad and uh others as well fragments as being a copy from an original.  The Greek New Testament is not a copy, it is a translation.  So we need to make that clear distinction because when Matthew was writing his gospel, he was writing it in Hebrew.  Now it was translated, as the early church fathers say, into other languages like Greek and probably, you know, we have it now in Latin and the German, all of that comes down even to our English, but they are a translation.  They are not a copy from the original Hebrew.  So the Greek is a translation.  We could talk about the epistles and Paul's letters being also part of a Greek translation.  The fact that Paul was a Hebrew Jew who spoke Hebrew comes from the house of Hillel.  Yes, he knew Greek, so I have no problem saying that his letters written to Hebrew Jews, also to the Hellenistic Jews being translated, but he was, in his mindset, a Hebrew-speaking Jew.  So anything outside of that as well is regards a translation.  Now we do get the words of Paul when he talks about, you know, all scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching and so forth.  The God breathed and the actual Greek translation of inspired is God breathed.  But the question is, what was he talking about?  The New Testament was not written then.  If you go back earlier to who he's addressing regards or what he's mentioning here, To Timothy, he says, of course, in verse 14, about from his childhood, you have known the sacred writings.  What sacred writings?  These are the Hebrew scriptures.  Paul is referring to the sacred writings of the Hebrew scriptures.  And, of course, he says of them which are able to give you wisdom that leads to salvation.  through faith, which is in Messiah Jesus.  So again, Paul's addressing the sacred scriptures that Timothy grew up in.  That is the Hebrew scriptures.  The New Testament was not written and translated at that time.  And for Paul, those Hebrew scriptures were sacred writings, which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation.  Or even the word salvation in Hebrew leads to Yeshua, which is the Hebrew name for what we get, Jesus, in our English.  So it is to salvation through faith.  which is in Messiah, Yeshua, Jesus.  See the wordplay there with salvation, you know, in the Greek, I mean, and from the Hebrew, which is not given in the Greek or given in other languages or translation, but in the Hebrew, it's that wordplay of what leads you to salvation, which is through faith, which is in Messiah, Yeshua.  Then he says, all scripture is inspired by God, profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be adequately equipped for every good work.  These are the Hebrew scriptures that Paul is referring to, the foundation that the New Testament was built upon.  And even in translation of the Greek, the Latin, all the other ones before the Greek and Latin, the Coptic, the Syriac, and the others, prior to the third, fourth century, and even going after that to the German and all the other ones up to our modern English, these are translations that are preserved and authoritative that we can still get the message.  The gospel message is not lost.  The theme of the New Testament is preserved not only in the translations, but also when we talk about, you know, rabbinic and Jewish sources about the Messiah, the things he was going to do and accomplish.  Those are also found in outside external sources, things in the Dead Sea Scrolls we can look at when they talk about the Messiah.  These are other ways to bring all this together so that the gospel message about Yeshua Jesus is still preserved in an authoritative way in all translations and in all other outside extra non-biblical sources.  So some people might want to call me, you know, say, oh, that's heresy.  That's, you know, false teaching.  If you don't believe the New Testament was originally written in Greek and that is the inerrancy authoritative word of God.  Well, again, if you want to add to one's salvation by saying, you know, Jesus plus that belief equals salvation, then you just added something to the work of Yeshua Jesus by having to believe in that.  I find no evidence for that in that sense.  It's a belief.  In fact, if you go back to look at how this premise arrived that the New Testament was originally written in Greek... You find that this is by outdated sources and beliefs that the Lengua Franca of that time and within the Judean desert in Israel and Jerusalem were Greek, was Greek-speaking Jews.  We know now that is not true.  We know now that at the temple and at the local synagogues within the Judean desert, these were the Proto-Masoretic texts, the Hebrew scriptures being read.  At the temple, in the local synagogues, the language of the Jews in those areas were Hebrew-speaking Jews.  We know that they were, in fact, if you look at Acts 6.1, you see the arguments between the Hebrew Jews and the Greek Jews, the Hellenist Jews, debating, you know, well, not debating pretty much, but having an issue with the widows.  being ignored.  And you see that go from there.  There is a clear distinction between them and Yeshua and the apostles were not Hellenistic Jews.  They were Hebrew Jews.  And that is clear from the scriptures.  That is clear from the evidence that we now know uncovered in documents as well as archaeological in those areas that they were not Greek speaking Jews.  So they would not have written the gospels in a language that was not theirs.  If Yeshua was speaking to them in Hebrew with the parables and everything else, it's only logical that they'd be writing down those things in the language.  And we know that Matthew wrote in Hebrew by the early church fathers.  We have Hebrew texts in museums today of Matthew and in other gospels as well as epistles, fragments of James and Revelation in Hebrew.  So these things to me, since they get ignored, it amazes me that we... have to have a certain belief in how the text was written in order to have salvation as well.  That's equated with our faith in Yeshua, Jesus, our Messiah.  So yes, if you want to call me a heretic, that's fine.  You want to add to the salvation formula of Yeshua, Jesus, plus that belief of having to believe in the Greek New Testament inspired and errant word of God, then by all means, add to it.  My faith and my salvation is based alone in my trust in the Messiah, Yeshua Jesus, the Son of God, and all my teachings of the essentials that you can find on my website, you can find on my YouTube blog, of the Trinity, and of course the resurrection of the dead, the resurrection of the Messiah, the virgin birth, the deity of the Messiah, all those things that are considered essential to our faith.  And what we proclaim in the gospel message, death, burial, resurrection, I affirm.  I just don't believe a translation is inerrant or infallible.  in translation and the greek is uh.  and whether you want to believe that or not that's fine.  do your own research do your own study.  don't take my word for it.  look at look into it for yourself.  there are many materials out there there's evidence.  but if you're only focusing on the more of the western tradition of the and the scholarly western consensus.  well that's fine.  i i don't look there anymore.  i look beyond that.  i look at the scholars in israel i see what's being discovered.  what's being found regards to the area in the region the language the the fragments and texts that are being just uncovered in hebrew.  and that leads me to believe completely that the new testament greek greek new testament is a translation.  it's an authoritative translation.  don't get me wrong.  like i said there is authority in the new testament in its translation and in in any translation for that matter.  but we can't i don't believe we should be arguing for the an errant inspired greek new testament if it wasn't written or spoken by the apostle by Jesus originally.  I think that's an issue.  So if Paul is speaking in Hebrew and we're reading it in Greek, it's a translation.  If Yeshua is speaking to his disciples in Hebrew and we're reading it in Greek or in Latin or even in your English text, your Bible today, it's a translation.  It's preserved for us.  Preservation is key for me.  I believe God has preserved even the Old Testament and all the other languages they're in, when you're English and you're the other Latin, the Greek, which is Septuagint.  I believe those are the preservations.  We still can get the gospel message, but sometimes, yes, we have to go back to the original language of the Hebrew to see a little more clearly sometimes or to get more detail out of it.  But God has preserved his words in translations, and I believe they have authority in them.  So you can't accuse me of not believing in the authoritative works of the scriptures in translation and in preservation.  So again, this is my quick discussing on what infallibility and inerrancy should be looked at and considered.  And in regards to as believers in the Hebrew scriptures as the foundation of the New Testament in all translations that we have authority and preservations in them.  But again, you know, if you want to call me heretic, then by all means, challenge my premise, challenge what I'm saying.  But the evidence is out there.  If you want to look at how this all began as far as New Testament being looked at in Greek as the inspired and errant word of God originally written in Greek.  You're going to get a shocking surprise if you find out that's based on a false premise of the lingua franca of the area within the Judean desert of Jerusalem and Israel and all where the Jews were as Hebrew-speaking Jews reading the Hebrew scriptures in the temples and local synagogues.  And outside from there were the Greek Hellenistic Jews who did use the Septuagint and, of course, had preserved the New Testament in Greek, even though it's 400 years later, with those fragments of that going back third and even second century.  And where are those fragments found?  Well, in Alexandria, in Egypt, in other parts of Egypt, in the area of those places where we find New Testament Greek fragments.  So they're not found in Israel.  They're not found in Jerusalem, these Greek texts or fragments.  They're not found anywhere within the Judean desert.  They're not found there.  New Testament Greek fragments are not found in those areas, but they're found outside of those areas, of course, in Egypt.  So again, we got to consider that.  We got to consider location, geographic, the people, the language.  And when we do that, we know, we come to this conclusion that, of course, the New Testament... is the Greek.  New Testament for that matter is a translation, an authoritative translation of the gospel message that has not changed.  The gospel message has not changed, will not change because we do have Jewish sources on it.  We do have the Hebrew scriptures.  We do have even some Hebrew New Testament copies of the gospels and the epistles and so forth, which we can examine and look at that actually shed some more light into the Greek, Latin, English, and all the other translations of the New Testament.
