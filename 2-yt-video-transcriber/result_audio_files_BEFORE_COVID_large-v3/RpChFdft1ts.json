            "text": "From April 19th through the 21st, 2019, a shark investigator attended the Red Bluff Roundup Rodeo in Red Bluff, California.  Our investigator filmed a lot of violent animal cruelty over the holiday weekend.  There were animals that were injured and at least a couple were killed.  The wild horse race is one of the cruelest events of rodeo.  A group of horses is released into the arena and teams of rodeo thugs assault them in an attempt to restrain, saddle, and ride the victims.  The event is complete chaos and is purposely terrifying for the horses.  Injury and death is a regular occurrence at rodeos that hold this event.  This horse was mortally injured during the wild horse race.  A needless amount of rodeo workers swarmed the horse in an attempt to hide the scene from attendees on one side, and a tarp was held up to block the view of the other side.  A steer was also killed during the rodeo, but Shark was unfortunately unable to document the incident.  Usually the cruelty, too, in the injuries and deaths of rodeo animals go unnoticed, but Shark was there to make certain that this didn't happen at Red Bluff in 2019.  Unfortunately, rodeo towns like Red Bluff tend to have media with little, if any, journalistic integrity. ",

I mean, that's the major question we asked ourselves years ago.  And then the answer was simple for us.  I mean, they're competing. ",

Rodeo professionals tell me that livestock are what make the rodeo so great, so they make sure to feed them well and give them plenty of water so that they can perform at their best. ",

            "text": "Claiming something does not make it true.  Those who are willing to abuse animals are also willing to lie about it.  Our footage of a steer being forced to limp out of the arena following a run shows just how little rodeo organizers care about their animals.  Why wasn't this clearly injured animal immediately stopped in the arena and examined by a vet?  Making an injured animal walk will only make the injury worse.  Shark also filmed several incidents of shocking devices being used on horses.  Rodeo thugs use the pain of the prod to force animals to perform, to run or buck against their nature and beyond their natural abilities.  This can result in injury and even death for the victims.  Additionally, shocking horses like this is illegal in California.  As professional media, the animal cruelty, injuries, deaths, and illegal shocking are all issues that KRCR reporters had a duty to expose.  But instead, they chose to promote animal abusers and lawbreakers.  This is an appalling failure of journalistic integrity.  We are challenging KRCR and most specifically reporter Megan Mackey for a response.  We are challenging Ms.  Mackey and KRCR generally to stop being shills and to tell the truth about rodeo animal abuse.  The bottom line is, rodeos don't exist in places where the media tells the truth.  We want KRCR to tell the truth about the animals that continue to suffer at the Red Bluff Roundup.  Please contact KRCR and politely but firmly ask the station to fairly report on the animals killed or injured during the rodeo, and to report on the illegal shocking of horses.  Contact information will be available in the description section of this video.  Let us know of any response you may receive.  Shark will release an update on this story with KRCR's response or lack of one.  Thank you for watching.  Please subscribe to our channel to see more of our investigations and learn what you can do to help Shark help animals. ",
