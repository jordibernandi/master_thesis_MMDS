Most of the world's cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Africa.  40,000 children are thought to work in mines in the Congo, making between one and two dollars a day.  A recent investigation found children as young as seven years old collecting, sorting and cleaning mineral ores for 10 to 24 hours straight.  They're exposed to dust that can lead to lung disease and some are even beaten by security guards. ",

Now, a new lawsuit blames some of the world's biggest tech companies from benefiting from those conditions, which have sometimes led to the deaths of child workers.  Cobalt is used in things like batteries and products for many Americans every day.  Deborah Pata is in Johannesburg.  Deborah, what's behind this lawsuit? ",

But a world away in Washington, there's new hope for the children in a lawsuit filed against major American tech companies who use the cobalt.  The suit filed against Apple, Google, Dell, Microsoft and Tesla accuses the companies of knowingly benefiting from and aiding and abetting the cruel and brutal use of young children in the DRC to mine cobalt.  Cobalt is used in almost every electronic device powered by batteries, from smartphones to electric cars.  Fourteen children who were injured or killed while mining are being represented by human rights lawyer Terry Collingsworth's firm. ",

We contacted all five companies for comment.  Apple said they've led the industry in standards and removed six cobalt refiners who don't meet those standards in 2019.  Dell said it never knowingly sourced operations using any form of child labor and is currently investigating these allegations.  Google, Microsoft and Tesla have not yet replied.  At the beginning of 2018, CBS News traveled to the DRC.  Here, children were lugging heavy sacks of cobalt to be washed in rivers.  From as early as four, they were picking it out of a pile, breathing in toxic fumes.  We followed a supply chain where child-mined and legally mined cobalt were not separated.  We told the story of one child, 11-year-old Zeki Swazi, who thanks to the generosity of our viewers was removed from the mines and given a chance to go to school, where he is now thriving. ",
