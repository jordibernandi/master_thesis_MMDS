            "text": "Hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  I want to talk to you on the subject about these rich preachers.  and is it wrong for a man in the ministry to be wealthy?  I've got a list here in front of me.  This is from CheatSheet.com and it talks about the top 10 richest preachers and ministries in North America.  The number 10 on the list is Joyce Meyer with a net worth of $8 million.  Number nine is T.D.  Jakes with a net worth of $18 million and and this is personal net worth.  Number eight is Franklin Graham, who has a net worth of 25 million.  Number seven is Rick Warren, who has another 25 million.  Number six is Billy Graham, the father of Franklin Graham, who has 25 million.  And Creflo Dollar is at number five with a net worth of $27 million.  Joel Osteen is at number four with a net worth of $40 million.  Benny Hinn is at number three with a net worth of $60 million.  And then number two is Pat Robertson, who has a net worth of $100 million.  And then the number one richest so-called pastor in North America is is Kenneth Copeland with an estimated net worth of $300 million.  And so these people have very deep pockets, lots of money.  And lots of times when I see people criticize these men, they oftentimes deal with the amount of money that these people have and say, you know, therefore, because they have this money, therefore they're charlatans and they're not right with God.  You just can't be right with God if you have that kind of money.  Now, We live in a society today where wealth is demonized by many people.  I think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and many others talk about the evil rich people and these one percenters.  And in their mind, if you have a million dollars, the only reason you have that is because you took it and exploited somebody else.  And that's not always true.  And so I want to give you just four questions about this, and we'll talk about this and discuss this.  about wealth, and is it wrong for a preacher to have money and have wealth like this?  Well, the first thing we've got to ask is, is having wealth, period?  Is having wealth wrong?  And I think the short answer to that is no.  There is nothing really biblically that says that just the owning of material possessions and the having of a measure of wealth is inherently wrong.  Now, I want you to know in the Bible, Abraham had wealth.  And I had a man talk to me a while back about the rich young ruler, and he came to Christ, and because of his riches, he wouldn't get saved.  He wouldn't come to the Lord.  Well, that really wasn't the issue.  The issue with the rich young ruler is that he would not acknowledge his covetousness as sin.  And so there's a difference between having wealth and being covetous.  There is a difference there, okay?  The rich young ruler went away sorrowful because he wouldn't repent of his covetousness and he wouldn't acknowledge that as sin.  Now, if you flip the other side of that, Zacchaeus was a rich man and he came to the Lord and he repented of that.  He said, Lord, if I've gained any wealth that I have, by dishonest means or fraudulent, I'll pay it back, I believe he said, threefold.  Well, the Lord didn't deal with his wealth.  The Lord accepted him and he was, I believe Zacchaeus was in heaven today, but the Lord never told Zacchaeus to give his money back.  He had wealth and the Lord allowed him to keep it.  So I think biblically there really isn't a case that we can say that having wealth is wrong.  Okay, I want to show this to you.  1 Timothy chapter number 6 talks about this and it says, in verse number eight, but they, excuse me, verse number nine of 1 Timothy chapter six, but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in perdition, destruction and perdition.  For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.  And so basically there's two things you got to understand.  It's not It's not the having of money is the root of all evil.  It is the love of money is the root of all evil.  And then also it says, it doesn't say, but they that are rich fall into temptation and snare.  It says they that will be rich.  So what happens is, is that when a man stops following God and starts following money, the Bible gives strong warning that if you're following money instead of following Christ, that you're going to air yourself from the faith and that you're going to mess yourself up spiritually.  You can ruin your life.  Now, Matthew 6.33 says this.  It says, let me just pull it up for you.  I want to make sure I say it exactly right.  Matthew 6.33 is a famous verse that many people quote.  And let's see if I can pull this up here real fast.  It talks about God providing for your life and just seek the Lord.  Matthew 6, 33 says, But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.  So it talks about 1 Timothy 6, about those who are seeking to be rich, those who will be rich, and those who are following after riches.  And it talks about Matthew 6, 33, those who are following after God, to seek ye first the kingdom of God.  And so really, it's not a matter of having wealth.  It's really an issue of wealth having you.  It is not wrong to have wealth.  But it is wrong for wealth to have you and for you to chase wealth.  And there is a difference between the two there.  So I don't think biblically we can say that having wealth is wrong.  Matter of fact, in the end of 1 Timothy chapter 6, it says this, verse 17, \"...charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to  enjoy.\".  And so it's saying there that if you have people, it's talking to Timothy, he said, if you have people that are rich, charge them in this world, that they don't be arrogant, high-minded, or trust in those riches.  But then it says this at the end of verse 17, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.  So let's just say, you know, you graduated from college, you've got a high-paying job.  the Lord has blessed you, you're in church, you're giving, you're doing right, and you can afford a brand new F-150 Raptor, and it's a big, nice truck, and you can afford that, man, knock yourself out and enjoy it.  I mean, there's really nothing immoral about that.  As long as your possessions don't have you and you have your possessions, as long as you're not following after money and you're still following after Christ, I don't know if really you can say biblically, That is wrong for a person to have money.  Now, let me just say another thing real quick.  Not only is having wealth, is it wrong?  No.  But the second question I want to throw at you is, is a preacher having wealth wrong?  Well, I don't know if you could say that either.  Now, I think it's wrong for a preacher to exploit wealth.  his church and steal from his church to gain wealth.  Of course, we would all agree on that, but I know men who pastor very small churches out in the middle of nowhere, out in the middle of Nebraska, and they pastor a very small church, and that church gives them just a little bit of money just to pay for their expenses, but this man on the side, he runs a farming business, and he does very well.  He's a wealthy guy, owns hundreds of acres.  I know another guy that runs a dump truck business where he transports things and does gravel and dirt and that kind of stuff.  And he's a multimillionaire pastor.  He's a small church.  And these men are doctrinally and morally straight as an arrow.  They are good men.  And so is it wrong for a preacher to have money?  Well, no, it's really not.  I mean, we live in a capitalistic society here in America.  So if a preacher is wealthy because of some business venture that he had, I don't know if you could really say biblically that it's wrong for a man to have that wealth.  So let me ask you another question.  Here's our third question.  I have this list here of these men who are very wealthy, Joyce Meyer, T.D.  Jakes, Franklin Graham, Rick Warren, Billy Graham, Creflo Dollar, Joel Osteen, Benny Hinn, Pat Robertson, and Kenneth Copeland.  Top ten richest preachers in North America.  And most of them, you know, we would call them heretics, of course.  But... How do these people make this money?  Well, they didn't make this money by stealing this money.  They didn't make this money by forcing people to give them money.  They made this money off donations, willful donations.  They made this money off of CDs and DVDs.  and book deals.  That's how they made this money.  They put out product and said, here it is for so-and-so, you can have this, and people buy it.  And so in a capitalistic society, nobody is forcing you to buy things unless you're Barack Obama and you're forcing people to buy healthcare, which they can't afford, which triples the price of that thing.  That's just another rant for another day.  But in a society like ours, nobody's making you buy this stuff.  And so These people are putting out TV shows and putting out flyers and putting out sermons saying, by the way, if you want to, you can buy our book.  And nobody's forcing these people to buy this.  So the wealth that they've gained is all been through, you know, through commerce.  It's been through, you know, selling things to folks.  You give us, you know, this amount of money, you can get this book, this DVD, this CD, this series.  They also do conferences and stuff like that.  So are we going to say that that is wrong?  Well, no.  Now, there are wrong ways to make money in the ministry, to have your money.  Like I knew one guy, he won a Rolex watch.  So he went and just took the church checkbook, wrote a $25,000 check, and went and bought himself a Rolex watch.  He lost his job.  He should have.  I mean, okay, he should have lost his job over that.  He got fired by that church.  Praise the Lord.  I think that's great.  And there are people who steal from ministries.  I know several stories of people that have had, you know, people go in there and just take money out of the missions account, out of the checking account.  I've seen that, okay?  So that is dishonest gain.  But these men, they've really done nothing illegal or immoral by the wealth they've acquired.  Now, I have a thing here, and it sounds like I'm defending these guys, but I'm not.  The, uh, Fox News reported, and this was, this was a long time ago, megachurch pastor criticized her buying his wife a 200, uh, 200 grand Lamborghini, $200,000 Lamborghini.  And this guy was, uh, Pastor John Gray, I'm going to read this article to you.  Pastor John Gray, the leader of Relentless Church in Greenville, South Carolina, came under fire for presenting his wife with an expensive vehicle.  A video went viral, which has since been deleted, showing the pastor surprising his wife with the keys to the luxury vehicle last week.  The pastor was criticized by social media users questioning how he could afford the car.  And so I want you to say this, that Pastor Gray defended himself, and I don't think he's a pastor, I think he's a quack, but Quote, Pastor buys his wife this expensive car, Gray said.  First of all, it wasn't a pastor who bought the car.  It was a husband that bought the car.  Get that in your spirit.  And he said this, did this man use any money from the church to do this, Gray answered.  The answer is no, absolutely not.  And God take my life on this live feed if I did.  The pastor continued with a car that was bought with the money he saved from his second book deal in fourth season on the reality show The Book of John Gray, which airs on the Oprah Winfrey Network channel.  So John Gray buys a $200,000 Lamborghini for his wife as an anniversary present.  Everybody goes crazy and says, you know, you can't do that.  You're a pastor.  You can't do that.  You can't have it.  these nice elaborate things.  Well, he goes on to defend himself saying, well, I got this because I got money from a book deal, and then I also have a reality show on the Oprah Winfrey Network, and that's a totally legitimate thing to say, all right?  So this man did nothing wrong by buying his wife this car.  Now, so Is wealth wrong?  No.  Is a pastor having wealth really wrong?  No, not really.  I mean, it's not.  But how do these people make their wealth?  They made their wealth.  It wasn't really through the ministry.  It was through book deals.  It was through DVDs.  It was through that kind of stuff.  That's how they made their money.  Okay, so let's get down to the real issue here.  What is the real issue?  The real issue is not the money.  The real issue is the doctrine that these people teach and preach.  I don't have any problem with a man named Creflo Dollar having money.  I do have a problem with what he preaches.  I don't have a problem with a man named Joel Osteen having money.  I have a problem with what he preaches.  I mean, I like, let's see, Kenneth Copeland.  I don't have a problem with a man named Kenneth Copeland having $300 million.  I have a problem with what they preach and what they teach.  Now, I want to show this to you, 2 Peter chapter 2.  I want you to understand this, that the Bible talks about making merchandise of God's people.  Now, in 2 Peter chapter 2, the Bible says, But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bringing upon themselves swift  destruction.\".  and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.  through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.  So it says in verse 3 that through covetousness they with feigned words shall make merchandise of you.  The issue is not making the merchandise.  The issue is the feigned words, and the issue is in verse number 1, the damnable heresies that they're teaching.  Now, people... are being exploited monetarily by these charlatans.  because they were first exploited theologically by these charlatans.  These people were exploited doctrinally before they ever were exploited financially.  And that is the issue.  If we can deal with the doctrine, then the money will take care of itself.  The money is the fruit.  The doctrine is the root.  And I think so many times we're just dealing with the fruit and we're not dealing with the root.  My personal opinion is that the money of Joel Osteen, the money of Kenneth Copeland, the money of Benny Hinn, the money of all these guys, the money of Creflo Dollar... That is a distraction from the real issue.  The issue is not the fact that a man has money.  I mean, there's nothing wrong.  Because by that standard, Abraham was wrong.  Abraham was a charlatan.  By that standard, I mean, Isaac and Jacob.  I mean, you think, look at Jacob.  He was like the second most powerful man in Egypt.  Probably had tremendous personal wealth.  If having money was wrong, then Jacob was wrong.  That's not the issue.  The issue is the doctrine.  The issue is what they teach and what they preach and what they say.  There is no virtue in poverty per se.  The doctrine is the issue.  It always has been the issue.  And I think sometimes we get distracted with their money.  Okay, Joel Osteen, Joyce Meyer, T.D.  Jakes, I'm not mad that they have nice cars.  I'm not mad that they have wealth.  I am mad that they are preaching and teaching a false doctrine and exploiting people theologically.  which leads to them exploiting people monetarily.  That is the issue.  This doctrine here, the Bible is the issue.  Money has never been the issue.  Don't ever let that become a distraction in your mind.  And so, you know, that being said, I have a book and I have two more that are, I'm getting ready to get, uh, get printed and we'll make an announcement on that before too long.  Um, you know, but I don't make a lot of money off that.  I mean, I, I don't, I don't make buku money.  Okay.  I make a little bit.  I make my enough to make my, uh, take my wife out to a nice dinner, maybe once a year and a nice dinner being, uh, uh, you know, McDonald's or so.  No, I, uh, There's a joke I heard the other day, I got to tell it to you.  A country preacher came in and said, hey, I want you to, wife, I want you to get ready, get your nice clothes on.  I'm going to take you out to one of them nice restaurants where they make the food right in front of you.  And so the wife was like, oh, man.  So she went and got on her nicest dress.  She pulled it out of the back of the closet and wore it in a long time, got it all ready, put her hair and makeup on, and got in some high heels, got in the car with her husband.  And they went out to that nice, fancy restaurant.  He said, baby, you're going to like this.  I'm going to take you to a restaurant.  where they make the food right in front of you.  It's going to be wonderful.  And then he pulled out and pulled right into a subway and said, here it is, baby.  This is the restaurant where they make the food right in front of you.  And so I thought that was great.  But, you know, we do get some money from our book.  It's not a lot.  I mean, it's barely anything.  And I didn't make the book to be rich.  I didn't make the book to make money.  I'm not trying to be covetous.  I'm just trying to get some truth out there and put it in a printed form for you so you can take it with you and show your friends.  That's what we're trying to do.  That's why we make this YouTube channel, so we can try to get some more truth out there to you.  But money has really never been the driving force in our ministry.  It never has.  I mean, there is an easier way to make a living than to do ministry like this.  So I'm not covetous.  I don't, I don't, I'm not, I mean, I'm not making this video to try to make money off you.  I didn't go to Africa to try to make money.  I'm not, I'm not traveling the country trying to make money, but the ministry does require money.  But these men, The issue with them is not the money.  The issue is the false doctrine that they teach.  And I'm more upset that these people are preaching a false gospel and sending people to hell than I am about the car that they drive.  I'm far more concerned about the damnable heresies than I am about the Bentleys.  And I'm far more concerned about the people that are going to cry out in the flames of hell, looking up and screaming and saying, Joyce Meyer told me wrong.  I'm far more concerned about that than I am about a nice watch that they have.  And so don't let this become a distraction.  Don't let that, listen, that's not the issue.  The issue is the doctrine, the Bible.  That is the issue.  And so, but other than that, I don't really have an opinion.  So God bless you guys.  Subscribe to our channel.  We love you.  We'll see you again soon. ",
