            "text": "Is America ready for a Hindu president?  Well, probably not.  I mean, I think this is still a Christian country, even though we're only hanging on by a thread.  But no less, that's not really why I'm here to talk to you today.  This is not about Hindu or Christian.  It's not about any of that, even though they are important things.  details when you're running for the President of the United States.  Now I have to admit I do not like having to make this video.  This video is putting me in a hard position because quite frankly I like Tulsi Gabbard.  I mean, I believe she's a good person.  She's saying all the right things.  I mean, I wish that she was a Caucasian male from Ohio.  But I don't think they're going to let a Caucasian male from Ohio say the things that they're going to let her say.  So this is our conversation today.  It's in my gut feeling that the evil 666 gang has engineered this conundrum or quandary that we are about to talk about.  It is a conundrum.  I mean, and make no mistake about it, this 666 gang have engineered this conundrum.  They are evil to the core.  I mean, to put this nice young lady in this dilemma, they are evil.  This is a test subject.  Okay, so by now you've already know that we're talking about Tulsi Gabbard.  And I've already told you she is a good person.  I like her.  She's saying all the right things.  But here's the problem.  She was born in Samoa.  So that's why we have to talk about this.  So before we go any further, I would like to say this.  I believe in her heart and soul, she is even more American than you or I. Now having said that, There are some important dates you have to remember.  One of the dates is 1949, and the other date is 1967.  Now, here's Tulsi's dad.  He was born in 1948.  He was born in Samoa.  So let's go into a few other examples of people who were not born in the states of America.  Take John McCain.  John McCain's parents, they were 100% American-born.  I mean, and John McCain's father was serving his country in the military, and he had a child on a U.S.  military base in Panama.  So I think most people would agree that, you know, John McCain being born in in Panama, on a base in Panama.  Both of his parents were American citizens.  I think we can both agree, everybody can agree, that John McCain was an American natural-born citizen.  Now here's the thing.  I'm going to show you right here.  The people born in Samoa are not citizens of the United States at birth.  So I'm going to be showing you some things here as we keep on talking.  Okay, I'll have another example here.  In fact, Obama was born in Hawaii, supposedly.  If, in fact, Obama was born in Hawaii, and then Hawaii joined the empire as a state, this would give Obama legal right to be president, assuming his birth certificate was not altered in any way and no fraud was perpetrated.  Okay, a lot of people are going to see similarities here with Obama.  Okay, but let's look at this.  In 1949, they tried to incorporate the American Samoa Island.  It did not work.  So it was not incorporated.  That was the important date in 1949.  So a year after Tulsi's dad was born in Samoa, they tried to do that.  Now, it gets a little bit more interesting.  Now here in 1956, the Navy appointed governor was replaced by a man who was locally elected.  Now they say that the Samoa, American Samoa Island is a self-governing under a constitution.  1967, very important here.  They claim that the American Samoa Island is a self-governing island under a constitution that became effective in 1967.  Now, this was brought on, I believe, by some of the chiefs.  There's some chiefs in Samoa.  Okay, so like I said, we're talking about a conundrum here, aren't we?  I mean, the bottom line is, unfortunately, as much as you might like Tulsi and as much as I might like her, she was born in Samoa.  Her father was Samoan.  She was not born in the 50 states.  Okay, one more example.  One more example.  I've talked about John McCain.  How about if you were born in the Arizona Territory?  Okay, you were born in the Arizona Territory, before Arizona was a state.  And then Arizona becomes a state in the Union.  This would be like the Barry Goldwater situation.  Barry Goldwater was born in the Arizona Territory.  But by the time Barry Goldwater run for president, Arizona was a state.  I mean, I think we all in agreement here that Barry Goldwater was an American citizen.  And as you can imagine, my ears are burning right now.  I mean, I can even feel and sense the people over in India, the people over in Samoa, the people in the cubicles at Google, the executives of Google, the executives of YouTube.  All those YouTube cubicles.  Those people are... They're calling me every name in the book right now.  I won't even go into the names they're calling me.  But I know my ears are burning right now.  But I got some questions for you.  Okay?  Was Tulsi... I mean, was she born on a military base in Samoa to an American soldier?  No.  Okay, so... We got... Okay.  No military base in Samoa.  She was not born to an American... I mean, was she born in one of the 50 ratified states of the Union?  No.  I mean, was she born in Alaska or Hawaii, say, you know, like 1945, before they became states in 1959?  No.  I mean, because that would be a legitimate question.  I mean, really, in this situation, this situation is not even a real conundrum.  It is really cut and dry.  She was born in Samoa.  And to my knowledge, Samoa never became a state in the Union.  Her father was born in Samoa.  The chiefs in Samoa want to be a self-governing land.  I mean, in many ways, this is cut and dry.  That's why I know that there are some people out there who engineered this.  They talked her into running, whether it be the 666 gang.  And, of course, you know the 666 gang is in control of the board, the state boards of education.  I won't go into... Her mother did win a seat on the State Board of Education.  We know how the Board of Education is involved in the matrix.  I mean, okay.  Okay, and here's the weird part.  I mean, we know that her father is a career politician or he's a politician.  He works in the matrix.  He doesn't create anything.  He takes from the taxpayer.  The mother works on the Board of Education.  I mean, she probably took from the taxpayer.  I mean, they all take from the taxpayer.  I mean, even though all this, they're in the matrix.  For some reason, I still like Tulsi, probably because she's saying all the right things.  But I take no pleasure in ripping her hopes and dreams to shreds.  I mean, it pains me.  To hurt a nice person like this.  But not everybody can become the president of the United States.  Not everybody can do it.  Contrary to what Obama and a reality TV star managed to pull off.  Okay, here's something that I really want to go into.  The big tell.  How we know that this was engineered by some very high people up there.  She will be allowed to say all the right things.  That's the big tell.  She will be allowed to expose the CIA like no other candidate.  You don't hear any candidates, you don't hear any male Caucasian boys from Ohio on national TV exposing the CIA.  No, you don't.  She will be allowed to tell the truth like no other before her, with the exception of possibly Ron Paul.  They let Ron Paul do it, but then behind the scenes, they stabbed him in the back as much as they could.  I mean, Ron Paul was born legally in one of the ratified states also.  I mean, do you see where I'm going with this?  I mean, why is she allowed to say on national mainstream media these truths, all this truth that most Americans already know in their heart?  See, she's a test subject.  They're going to allow her to say all the right things.  She's going to tell you everything you want to hear.  The truth about what's happened for the last 20 years.  The CIA,  etc.,  etc.  She's going to be able to tell you, yeah, you American slaves deserve a universal basic income.  She's going to say all the right things, but only one problem.  Here's the rub.  I mean, she was born in Samoa.  And they want to be a self-governing land.  1967, the Samoan chiefs say, we really don't want to be part of you American scum.  I mean, this is sad.  This is a sad story.  So what's the bottom line here?  I mean, you're being acclimated to the possibility.  We are being acclimated.  We are being slowly brainwashed.  To understand that this is no longer a Christian nation.  And maybe, just possibly, the possibility that there, yeah, we're going to elect somebody who was not born in one of the states.  Remember Ted Cruz?  Ted Cruz?  The Obama situation?  Now Tulsi?  I mean, they're slowly trying to get you to understand that.  The possibility of, yes, it can happen.  We don't care about the Constitution.  Well, let me end with a clear-cut case that all Americans could agree with.  Let's listen to this scenario and see if you agree with me.  You have a lady, okay?  You have a lady from Ohio or Pennsylvania, I don't care where, one of the states.  She's a clear-cut U.S.  citizen, born and raised.  And she takes a vacation to Russia.  Meets a Russian stud.  Has a baby there.  And the baby is born in Russia.  Raised a few years in Russia.  Goes to school there.  Maybe raised as a Hindu or a Russian religion or a Siberian.  I don't care what tradition.  little babies raised him.  Born in Russia.  And then that little Russian boy, born to a Russian man, comes back to Washington,  D.C.,  and tries to run for the President of the United States.  I mean, can we all agree that this is not what our founding fathers would have wanted?  Think about it.  It's not like this lady went to Russia with her husband, with her American husband.  They had a child in Russia on a military base.  I mean, then that would bring up a real conundrum there.  Now, that's not the scenario I just brought up.  The scenario I brought up with some American lady who goes to a foreign land.  I mean, that land could be Russia, Thailand, Serbia, Africa, Cuba, or even the Samoa Islands, for God's sake.  I mean, yes, these ladies, these American ladies are free to go to any country they want and breed with any foreign stud they want.  But that doesn't make the baby an American citizen when the baby was born.  Say maybe, like I said, Russia, Thailand, Serbia, Africa, Cuba, Samoa Islands.  Come on.  Can we agree on this?  This is not what our founding fathers wanted.  I mean, but what really breaks my heart about busting this wonderful lady's hopes and dreams is that she even supports a universal basic income for all the slaves in America.  She's saying all the right things.  And like I've said before, in her heart and soul, she is even more American than you and I, probably.  I mean, she served her country well.  with honor and dignity, more than most of those reality TV stars we have out there.  But, and this is a big but, if the 666 gang can legitimize her birthright, that's what it comes down to.  If they can legitimize her birthright, no matter where she's born on this planet, I mean, what's next for America, if there's even an America left?  I mean, what's next?  Maybe even BB can run for president.  Maybe that's their whole agenda, to acclimate us, to get us just slowly get us used to the fact that, hey, yeah, what's wrong?  Why can't BB run for president of the United States?  I mean, you know Congress is not going to say a word about it.  You know Congress is going to get on their hands and knees and say, oh, yeah, let it happen.  Yeah, what is their true agenda here?  Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the Prime Minister of Israel, His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu.  Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the Prime Minister of Israel, His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu. ",
