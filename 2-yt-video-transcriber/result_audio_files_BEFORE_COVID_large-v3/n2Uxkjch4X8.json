            "text": "Ghana has been so impressive, guys.  So impressive.  I mean, I'm impressed.  I'm excited.  I can't wait to share my feelings and observations about this country with you guys.  Like, you need to come to Ghana, guys.  When I got here, right from the airport, it was one pleasant experience to the other until... Now that I'm here even speaking with you guys.  so today I want to share with you guys my observations about Ghana and how much I've you know been impressed by Ghana so far.  so welcome back to my channel guys.  if you're new you're welcome here.  if you're new thank you for always coming back.  do consider clicking the subscribe button now.  let me give you my observations.  so obviously the first thing i noticed when i got to ghana was the population.  coming from a country that has a very large population and sometimes seems so overwhelming and chaotic.  coming to ghana was a pleasant experience.  i got here and i noticed that it's not as populated.  it's not as crowded as it is you know in lagos where i live in nigeria generally.  so i was pleasantly you know impressed by what i saw and moving around is so easy.  you're able to get things done in real time without having to really you know spend much time in traffic or just the hassle of moving from one place to the other.  it's so easy and quite seamless moving about.  so that's one thing i observed about ghana.  the population is less and it's more easy to move about and just interact and get things done here, especially in Accra, where I've been staying ever since I came to Ghana.  The next thing I noticed about Ghana is the public transportation system.  They have these beautiful, cute, small taxis that move around.  They're all over the streets.  It's easy for you to get about when you want to go anywhere.  Bikes are not found on the streets.  I think it's illegal for bikes to move.  Taxis are readily available.  They also have the Trotro.  That is the buses, what negotiations call downfall.  So here we have the Trotro and they are, you know, applying the rules to different locations.  So it's easy to also move about from one location to the other.  And there's less drama with using the trotros.  Like, when you get in there, the trotros are clean, the conductors are pleasant.  It's not as dramatic as it gets when you enter a public bus in Nigeria, especially in Lagos.  So it's just gentle.  Even when they are calling passengers on the road, it's not noisy, just... i mean just come you go in there you sit down clean you pay your fare.  there's nothing like oh you're changing i don't get.  change you all those things that they keep telling you when you enter for.  so it's also gentle and everything guys i i love it.  i've used the threshold for like more than once and it was the same experience.  so i can't say for sure that the trotters are less dramatic and just a pleasant clean experience driving in there.  the only thing though that i observed is the.  you know the cost in transportation.  i heard that probably is because of the year of return and because it's a festive period that the prices have sort of increased.  otherwise the prices are usually you know friendly and quite reasonable.  but so far apart from the pricing it's Impressive guys and the taxi drivers are friendly.  They are chatty as you are driving with them especially when they know that you are a Visitor into Ghana.  They're so friendly.  They are chatty and just wanted to feel comfortable and make you feel at home.  this particular one guys is It just intrigued me, like, coming from a place where there's so much going on in terms of traffic and movement and congestions on the road.  In Accra, I found that motorists actually stop for pedestrians to cross.  Like, the first day it happened, I was on my way to Labadi Beach, and in the taxi I boarded, I think a young boy and a girl wanted to cross the road.  The taxi driver was driving, and they actually, you know, wait that him back on that thing to slow down and he actually slowed down for them to cross the road before we proceeded.  like it's so different it doesn't happen.  in lagos in nigeria you have to wait.  if you don't wait they'll You risk your legs being broken.  You don't even try that.  So I was so impressed.  And it was not just that day.  It happened like several times.  Even for me personally, motorists have had to stop for me several times to cross.  So I was like, this is impressive.  I kept telling Napi that, Napi, is this how, you know, considerate your motorists are here?  Like they stop for you to cross before you go?  And zebra crossing, you know zebra crossing, they stop for you to cross.  Don't try that in Nigeria, guys.  Don't try it.  You'll learn to be chopped off by the motorists.  So that's another pleasant experience I've had and another pleasant observation I've made about Ghana.  Your motorist thumbs up.  Thank you for always stopping for pedestrians to cross before you go.  Keep doing it.  And then waste management in Ghana is good.  Guys, I like it.  Like, there are waste bins on the streets and Ghanaians actually use the waste bins.  Like, you see them dumping refuse in the waste bins.  I was like, how did you guys get to this point?  Like, you guys know what I mean, Nigerians.  doesn't happen like that where i am coming from.  you know how we do it guys.  you know how we do it.  even when waste bins are provided we rarely use them so most times not even find the waste bins on the street.  so we just drink sachet water and drop it where we want.  we drink bottle water and drop it where we want to drink fizzy drinks and dump the bottles where we want.  and Nigerians don't come for me.  You guys know I'm saying the truth.  You know I'm saying the truth.  I was so impressed.  Like, waste bins on the streets, in strategic locations, you drink and dump your waste bottles and all that.  And they're actually using the waste bottles.  You don't see, you know, waste littered on the streets all over.  You don't see refuse heaped all over the place.  It's so clean.  It's beautiful, guys.  Ghanaians... It's like I'm going to relocate and stay.  What do you think?  Will you offer me accommodation and a job?  Let me know so that I can relocate and live in Accra.  So you know how you are in the city and you are hungry, you want to eat.  Just move around.  Roadside bookers are clean.  Where they are selling their food is clean.  You know, the shops are clean.  Where they are cooking is clean.  The plates are clean, everything.  You just feel comfortable eating.  even You know, even though it's street food, you feel comfortable eating because it's just clean, impressive.  Like, you don't have any fear of, okay, so what I'm trying to eat, I doubt how it was prepared or where they are serving.  it is not hygienic or not clean.  It's clean.  Guys, I'm impressed by your street restaurants.  They are clean, their food is good, and their service is also good.  So, I like that about Ghana as well.  Keep it clean and keep it hygienic.  Electricity is also not an issue in Accra, Ghana.  Since I came there has been stable electricity, stable water supply, like it's running, water is running all the time and electricity is stable, like 247.  I think ever since I came there was power outages once and I've stayed for over a week now.  So I'm impressed that there's actually stable power supply so people can do businesses, you know, and do a whole lot of things and just live comfortably even at home.  At night I sleep comfortably and even though I'm staying in a community where it's not a hotel, the electricity is stable.  so I stay comfortably and get my things done without any issues.  Coming from Nigeria and knowing that Ghana is an English-speaking country, I assumed that everybody in Ghana would probably speak English, but guys, that was wrong.  So this is the observation I made.  there are people here in Accra who actually do not speak English.  So that was somehow new and I think it's quite relatable because even in Nigeria there are people who don't speak English.  so I understand that but I just had the assumption that everybody in Ghana would probably speak English because when I went to Benin Republic It was a French-speaking country, so it was normal to come across people who could not speak English.  But I assumed that coming to Ghana, everybody would speak English, but that wasn't the case.  When I got out on the street and tried to interact with some people, I found that they could not speak English, they did not understand English.  It's normal.  We have people like that in Nigeria as well.  So that's another observation I made about Ghana.  So when you come, guys, bear it in mind that not everybody speaks or understands English.  So when you interact with people on the street and they don't understand you, excuse them.  Get the next person who understands English and communicate.  So overall, my experience in Ghana has been good, has been pleasant.  I'm still enjoying Ghana and I think I would like to come back again.  So guys, if you've not visited Ghana, come visit Ghana.  The people are warm, you know, it's a comfortable place.  You will enjoy it here, trust me.  I can't emphasize it enough.  Ghanaians, I've had and I'm still having a good time in your country and I'm at home here.  I feel at home in your country.  Thank you so much for having me and being so nice and so warm.  Thank you guys also for watching this video.  Have you visited Ghana before?  If you visited Ghana, what were the observations you have about it, please drop a comment.  I want to know.  Ghanaians, what other things do you have to suggest to me to look out for while I'm still here?  that might probably be interesting to me?  Drop a comment.  I would like to know.  Thank you guys so much for watching this video.  I'll see you guys in my next video.  Bye. ",
