            "text": "This video is sponsored by Skillshare.  So this video is a little bit different than what I normally do.  It's a bit YouTube-centric.  And I know a lot of you don't really keep up with all of that stuff.  So just kind of bear with me.  We'll get back on track for the next video.  But there's been this conversation going on for the past few months or so, maybe even longer, but it's definitely picked up more recently.  And in fact, I'm pretty late to the party with this video, as I usually am.  People have been talking about this thing called left tube, which is kind of a nebulous term that means different things to different people.  But it basically refers to a loosely related group of YouTubers who either vaguely or specifically make content specifically about or at least informed by left-wing politics.  And I know that's kind of an ambiguous definition.  But, you know, that's kind of part of the problem.  You may have also heard the term bread tube, which is definitely funnier, at least.  And I think the term bread tube predates the term left tube.  I could be wrong about that, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's, you know, it's been on Reddit for a while now.  I think that most people use the term bread tube and the term left tube interchangeably, but there are people who want to say that bread tube should only apply to specifically leftist content, by which I mean channels that are mostly informed by communist and or anarchist content, as the term bread tube itself is a reference to the book The Conquest of Bread by anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin.  But there's also a whole thing about that, which I'll get into in a minute.  So my channel, this channel T1J, is often referred to as a LeftTube channel.  In fact, I was just interviewed for an article in the New Republic about LeftTube.  But full disclosure, the more I hear people talking about LeftTube and BreadTube, the more I'm starting to hate those terms.  Hi, I'm T1J.  Follow me.  So those of you that have been following me for a long time have probably noticed a pretty unmistakable evolution in the way that I express my ideas, both on this channel and on social media.  I've talked about this in several videos, but I've always considered myself a progressive person.  I've always been in favor of social justice and economic reform.  My baseline views have pretty much stayed the same throughout my whole YouTube career.  However, I still found myself occasionally being reactionary and hard-headed on certain issues.  I still frequently critique the left, especially social media activism, but those critiques are much less cynical than they were in the past.  Once I began to become a little more empathetic and thoughtful about how I engage with topics like feminism and LGBTQ, while also being more critical of people who I thought were confronting these topics in bad faith, I was immediately branded a social justice warrior, or SJW, by this growing anti-progressive movement on the internet.  I even lost subscribers.  Bunch of angry dudes made videos about me and everything.  And I'd say the SJWs on YouTube, who were trying to create an intellectual alternative to the reactionaries who dominated political conversation on YouTube at the time, is the precursor to what eventually became known as LeftTube.  And after the rise of Trump and other far-right public figures who I'd argue were ushered into the mainstream by these anti-SJWs, it became clear that progressive-minded people needed to step up to the plate, everywhere, but also on YouTube.  And step up many of them did, some of them becoming fairly popular in a relatively short amount of time.  And their high quality videos inspired other creators to either start making their own videos or work harder on their existing ones.  And their success led people to seek out other creators with similar content, leading to other channels growing as well.  I've definitely benefited from this myself.  Now at first I was happy to be associated with Left2 because most of the creators that get referenced are people that I'm fans of.  So I don't want anyone to take this as any kind of jab or slight against any other creator.  These are people that I like.  Not people that I always agree with 100%, but these are people making thoughtful, entertaining content that challenges the systems of oppression in the world rather than trying to uphold them.  And I think that's what we need right now.  And most of them seem like decent people personally as well.  Natalie and H-Bomb are literally two of my favorite YouTubers of all time.  I just put them in the thumbnail so you would click on it.  But with popular public figures comes a fandom.  And with a fandom comes, it seems inevitably, drama and gatekeeping.  So the first problem that came to my attention was the question of who even counts as LeftTube?  It seems like it should include anyone making videos about progressive or left-wing political and social topics.  But there are people like Lindsay Ellis and Dan Olson, whose videos are definitely informed by political ideas, but who mostly do pop culture analysis.  but are still usually considered members of LeftTube.  So maybe it's the format instead of the subject matter.  Many of the people who are most often called LeftTube use a short film or video essay format.  So does that mean that channels like Creationist Cat and Ray Ro Show aren't LeftTube?  because the format isn't quite right, even though they're both very clearly left-wing channels?  Do you have to make heavily researched 40-minute long videos with props and sets in order to be considered a real Leftuber?  Sometimes it seems to me that Leftube is just like an exclusive club that you get into based on who you know, who you're friends with, and how much people like you, and not really based on what kind of channel you have.  Some people try to draw the line in terms of just how left-wing are you.  Channels like Megan Tonjes and Akilah Obviously are very clearly informed by left-wing politics, but I rarely hear people call them left-tube.  Maybe they're not perceived as left-wing enough.  Destiny is a polarizing figure in this conversation, because while most people agree that he's doing good work fighting against the far right, many others find his edgy persona and overt support for capitalism problematic.  And so far as I've seen, he's usually excluded when referencing LeftTube.  But if I had to guess, I'd say my economic views are probably closer to Destiny's than, say, Sean's.  But people still call me LeftTube all the time.  Many other YouTubers came up in the social justice space just like I did, but rarely get referenced in these conversations.  People like Steve Shives and Demotivator Opinion.  How am I LeftTube, but they aren't?  Is it because I have more Twitter followers?  I think it's literally just because I'm more friendly with the established LeftTubers than they are.  But not left-wing enough seems to be just about where we've landed in this conversation.  And that's just super cringy to say out loud.  If that isn't gatekeeping, I don't know what is.  More recently, some folks are trying to shift the definition of left-tube away from social justice to focus specifically on critiques of capitalism.  This seems odd to me, because a lot of the so-called left-tubers don't even really make that many videos about class or economic theory.  And of course, if you don't want to make videos about that, you don't have to.  But it's almost like you're needed to check a box on your personal convictions before you're invited to this club, regardless of what's actually on your channel.  At least that's how it seems some people want it to be.  Now much like with any of these isms, I think when people talk about capitalism, they're often adding a lot of baggage to it based on their own interpretations of current events and how certain countries operate, particularly the United States, as if this silly country should be used as a model for anything.  But assuming this is referencing the basic textbook definition of capitalism, and I think that people are rarely doing that, but let's be charitable, an anti-capitalist YouTuber would be a YouTuber who doesn't think that the means of production should be privately owned and used for profit.  That would be the baseline, right?  Certainly this includes many, if not most, of the established left-tubers, but I wonder if it includes all of them.  I think America's economic and social system is supremely fucked and needs to be completely overhauled systematically like ASAP.  But I don't have much of a problem with the idea of private ownership and profit as the concept.  So if that single fact disqualifies me from being a real leftuber, then okay, I guess.  But I feel like most people knew this about me.  And even when people don't know, when they find out, they're usually like, It's okay, you can still be part of the team.  Like I'm some kind of charity case, like I'm the out of shape kid getting picked for the kickball team because they feel bad for him.  Even worse is the people who basically say, well, I love your work, I think you're doing good work, but eventually down the line, we're gonna need you to sort of step aside so we can do our thing.  But thanks for your contribution, I think you did some good work, but we won't need you anymore at that point.  Someone literally told me recently that I am the equivalent of the woman in the red dress from The Matrix, implying, I guess, that while I might have a little more to offer than the average drone, I'm nevertheless just another product of the system.  And it's like... I'm a person.  I have agency.  My perspective is just as valid as anybody else's.  I'm out here trying to make thoughtful content and start conversations about topics I think are important.  I'm not an accessory to someone else's revolution.  I have no interest in that.  The woman in the red dress analogy is particularly insulting because in the movie, the woman served to distract Neo from his objective.  And I don't think of myself or my content as a distraction.  My goal is to move things forward and maybe make things better.  And again, this is why some people want to separate bread tube from left tube.  But some people say, if you're not a leftist, then you're not a left tuber.  Yo, I'm super down for discussing and debating the merits of different political and economic ideas, and I'm super down for trying out different policies and proposals that might make the world better for the most disadvantaged people, even if it's not an idea that I came up with.  I'm not super down for essentially telling people to get out of your way so that you can impose your ideology on the world, whether I agree with you or not, whether that comes from the left or the right.  But anyway, this just leads to more debate about who's the real left tube, or even worse, who should we allow to be in the left tube?  And it's just all very much not my jam.  So next I'm going to talk a little bit about the left tube.  so white thing.  People have commented for a while now about how most of the most successful left tubers, and probably most left tubers in general, are white.  Cat Black made a great video not too long ago discussing this, which was the first time I think an actual prominent YouTuber of color has addressed it in a significant way.  I could be wrong about that.  And when you think of what people generally refer to as LeftTube, it is usually the same names that pop up over and over again, and it is 95% white people.  And you should watch Kat's video for a more thorough discussion, but it should be no surprise to anyone who has done any research on social issues that people are more willing to hear an idea when it's coming from a white person.  It sucks, but it's a thing.  But it's not just the creators.  I don't know if you all know this, but there are quite a few YouTube channels that feature people of color, some of whom are actually doing pretty well for themselves, who regularly discuss or at least reference politics and social issues from a primarily progressive standpoint.  Sometimes the videos are very similar to other LeftTube stuff but with a specific focus on racial and cultural issues, but they also often do it through a different lens than what is normally found on LeftTube, or at least what is usually referred to as LeftTube.  Sometimes it's pop culture reviews, or comedy sketches, or interviews, or celebrity gossip, or even beauty tutorials.  It's a different format, but they still sometimes find a way to talk to their audiences about important topics.  And as I mentioned before, there are established left-tubers who don't focus specifically on politics, so that's not a deal-breaker.  The difference really, in my estimation, is that those videos made by people of color aren't really made for white people.  And so they're thought of as a completely different genre.  And YouTube's algorithm no doubt considers them a different genre as well.  And I obviously don't make my videos for white people, at least not usually, but I don't specifically target black people either.  And I think a lot of those other channels do specifically target people of color, which is fine.  But as a result, my audience is nevertheless overwhelmingly white.  And I know this because I survey my audience every year.  And that's fine, I'm okay with that.  But I also think it has a lot to do with why people are so comfortable with allowing me into the LeftTube conversation.  My videos are white people approved.  And I don't know other people's demographics, but I bet it's a similar situation for other people of color in this community.  Similarly, there are a lot of channels that are focused on women's issues and LGBTQ topics that rarely get mentioned in conversations about LeftTube.  And it's a little bit different because there are definitely a lot of women and LGBTQ people within the LeftTube community, but it still seems that if your content isn't specifically palatable to straight white people, you have a fairly low chance of being involved with this club.  You can be a successful YouTuber, as most of the people I've featured are to some extent, just not a successful LeftTuber.  And I'm pretty wary about this push to move LeftTube away from social justice, because I think it's something we very much still need to be talking about.  Critiquing economic systems is fine and necessary, but it is not the full story.  Especially if you're leaving out how different groups are disproportionately affected.  I've been making YouTube videos for something like 10 years now, and my channel has gone through many evolutions and probably will continue to evolve.  But the primary reason I make videos has always been the same.  I like doing it.  I like making stuff and sharing it with people.  That's it.  That's all I've ever wanted to do, really.  I've managed after grinding for many years to make it into some semblance of a career, but it's something I would definitely still do if I didn't get paid for it.  I also obviously have some thoughts about things that I think are important and want to start discussions about.  And it seems like a lot of you like to listen to what I have to say, which I appreciate vastly.  But I don't want to make this seem like this is anything other than basically a random dude making videos on the internet.  Now don't get me wrong, I've definitely gotten a lot of messages from people who've said that my videos have helped them understand something better, or that I've helped them become more thoughtful about things, and that's amazing.  I don't mean to downplay the real effect that people in my position can have.  And I don't take that lightly at all.  It's something that I am always conscious about.  In fact, it's one of the reasons why I've chosen to have these discussions in the first place.  But, and I've said this before many times, I'm not an expert or an authority on any topic.  If you like what I have to say, that's awesome, but I don't want to pretend like I'm some kind of thought leader or that I magically know what's going to fix society just because I read a couple books or watched a couple video essays.  Any of your measured opinions on any topic that I cover are just as useful and valid as anything I have to say.  And a lot of you might not really care about this, but I just want to make sure you know where I stand on that.  A lot of people talk about LeftTube and other political creators as if they're like the chosen ones, but really we're just some people on the internet that are pretty good at talking.  The article I mentioned earlier is titled, Can the Left Win YouTube?  But I'm not really trying to win YouTube.  I know I'm a broken record at this point, but I just want to make some videos, y'all.  If we can help some people or change some minds along the way, then that's great too.  So yeah, I'm just over the whole LeftTube thing at this point.  I mean, I 100% appreciate all of the support that I've gotten from people in this community, all of the shoutouts and sharing of my videos and my channel.  That's amazing.  I love it.  I cannot express how much that means to me.  And I'm not going to like freak out if people continue to like add me to lists of left tubers or whatever, you know, feel free to do that if you want to.  But at the end of the day, all I really want to do is make some cool videos that encourage people to be kind to each other and to be thoughtful about how we might make the world a better place.  And if I'm able to do that, I don't really care about all that other stuff, especially if there's exclusion and gatekeeping involved.  But that's just me though.  What do you think?
