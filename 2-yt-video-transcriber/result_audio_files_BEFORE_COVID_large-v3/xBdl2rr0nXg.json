As I've said a million times before, there's no such thing as vegan babies or kids because all of them, at best, grow up vegetarian, which is how they get some of the fat soluble vitamins and somehow survive.  I don't know their full story.  The kid is getting lots of phytic acid and other anti-nutrients from the granola, which will lead to malnutrition and will destroy his gut.  The sugar also.
