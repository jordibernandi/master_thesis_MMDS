            "text": "A woman wrote me and told me her husband asked to have sex with her one night.  She told him no, but found him having sex with her in the middle of the night.  She asked if this was considered marital rape.  I told her that no, this wasn't considered marital rape.  I'm sorry Laurie, but what the hell is wrong with you?  So firstly, before we actually jump into this video and the blog post that we're going to be reading today, the first thing I want to make very, very clear is there is no such thing as marital rape.  Let's just call it what it is.  Rape.  If a person has sex with another person without their consent, then it's not sex.  It's rape.  It needs no special qualifiers, no descriptions, it's just rape.  And it's never okay.  Somehow, while I was taking my little mental health break, I missed a hell of a lot of posts from the Transformed Wife, actually from everyone.  I normally kind of like try and keep up to date with other YouTubers, bloggers, everything, but I just stayed away from the internet and I didn't, you know, look at anything.  So yesterday I was like, you know what, I'm going to have a look at Laurie's blog, have a little read through it, and I'm just casually browsing it when I came across what is potentially the worst, most dangerous thing she's ever written.  in a post titled, Was This Truly Marital Rape?  Yeah, let's just read that first bit again, shall we?  A woman wrote to me and told me her husband asked to have sex with her one night.  She told him no, but found him having sex with her in the middle of the night.  She asked if this was considered marital rape.  So here's a woman who has literally been hurt, abused, taken advantage of, disrespected, not listened to, used, treated like an object, and it's asking for help.  The correct response here is, yes, you were raped, I'm sorry, it's not your fault, your husband is entirely to blame, and then you offer them guidance, you offer resources where she can get support and help, and so on.  Sorry, we have a grumbly Cairo today.  She wants attention, don't you?  But since Laurie is not a decent human being, she instead replied with, Is she serious right now?  How is it okay for anyone to write and publish this kind of crap?  This is such a weird, outdated, and just completely blatantly wrong response.  And not only that, but it's dangerous as well, and that's what really upsets me, and that's why I had to make this video.  genuinely makes me worried for Laurie and I really really with all my heart hope that she doesn't have these views.  and she's not just saying this because she's been in a position where she was raped by her husband and she's now trying to justify it by being like oh no he wasn't drunk so it wasn't rape.  I really hope that's not where she's coming from because that would be heartbreaking and no person ever deserves to be violated by another person.  Rape is rape.  Non-consensual sexual contact is rape.  The perpetrator doesn't have to be drunk or high or fit a certain profile.  It doesn't have to happen on multiple occasions.  Anyone can rape you, whether you're married or in a relationship or not.  whether they're a friend or a family member or a stranger.  To not understand this and to teach the opposite, which is a blatant lie, is dangerous and it unfairly minimizes the suffering of the victim.  The Transformed Wife goes on and she writes, If there is true marital rape, there is physical abuse that comes with it.  I'm sorry, but how is taking advantage of someone's body when they haven't given you consent not considered physical abuse?  And again, it's such a naive, dangerous view to have.  Not all rapes involve violence or anger and it's dangerous to try and claim they do.  Not all rapes fit the stereotypical pattern that you have.  The fact is that anything can be rape if you don't or can't give your consent.  If you're asleep and someone puts their penis in you, that is rape.  If you're passed out because you're drunk and someone puts their penis in you, that is rape.  They don't have to have hit you or beaten you before.  If you are unable to give consent, it's rape.  Sorry, I'm talking about this in front of you being, it can't be nice, can it?  Why not?  She writes, every woman who has told me that they were raped by their husbands also told me that they were physically abused by their husbands.  In this case, the authorities need to be called and the wife needs to be protected from her physically abusive husband.  Well, I mean, that first bit's clearly a lie because here is a woman telling you about the time she was raped without mentioning any other physical abuse.  Rape doesn't only become bad if someone hits you as well.  Non-consensual sex is never okay regardless of the other circumstances around it.  How can Laurie think a man raping his wife is okay, but a man hitting his wife isn't?  There's no difference there.  Neither is okay.  The fact that Laurie is trying to make excuses or apologies or add conditions to rape is one of the most disgusting things you can do.  She's literally a rape apologist.  She goes on and says, in the case I mentioned in the video, so she's, for context, this blog post is on the back of her talking about this woman's story in a video and the She got backlash and then she decided to clarify it in this blog post.  So she says, in the case I mentioned in the video, this wasn't marital rape.  Her husband doesn't physically abuse her.  He woke up in the middle of the night, maybe he wasn't even fully awake for all we know, don't make excuses for a rapist, and began having sex with his wife.  What does this mean?  Was he having full-on intercourse with her or was he having foreplay with her?  We don't know.  She didn't tell me.  If he was having full-on intercourse with her, she must be a very deep sleeper.  But even if he was, I would never consider this marital rape.  At this point with everything we've said so far, I shouldn't even have to explain to you guys why this is utter crap.  But it is utter crap.  Her questions about what kind of sex it was don't matter.  The fact is, he was having sex with her when she was unable to consent.  Whether the woman is a deep sleeper or not doesn't matter.  Whether he penetrated her with his penis or his fingers or whatever, doesn't matter.  The fact is he did it without her consent and that's not okay.  The only facts that matter are this man asked his wife to have sex, she said no, and yet woke up to someone being sexually intimate with her when she was not able to and did not consent.  That is never okay, that is literally rape, and I don't understand how you can try and excuse this or blame the victim like Laurie is.  The transformed wife could not be more wrong about this situation.  And it breaks my heart to think that people are coming to her asking for advice and this is what she's telling them.  It's so dangerous.  She's not just some bored, lonely housewife that we can like have a giggle about and mock and make fun of and be like, oh, look at this old fashioned woman.  Isn't she silly?  She's not.  She's dangerous and she's putting people in danger.  I'm sorry he's making you stressed.  I'm sorry, baby.  The real problem is that vulnerable people are coming to Laurie and asking for advice and trusting her and believing the things she says, and the advice she's giving is so dangerous.  It's terrifying that anyone could listen to her and that she might end up harming more people.  Let's say I told her that yes, this was marital rape, then she would report it to the police in the morning.  Her husband may be put in jail, then lose his job.  Oh no, a rapist gets the punishment for being a rapist.  How terrible.  Look, if you don't want to risk jail and losing your job because you raped someone, it's quite simple.  Don't rape someone.  I mean, and it's not even like there are these like difficult rules to follow.  It's just, if a person doesn't want to have sex with you, don't have sex with them.  It's that simple.  You don't accidentally slip and find your penis inside someone, do you?  I know.  I know you don't.  You don't.  I know.  Careful, babe.  Careful, babe.  Do you want to get down with me?  Come on.  Come down.  Do you want to go play with Ben?  Yeah.  Love you.  He would have no means to support his family.  He may even divorce her for considering him having sex with her one night as marital rape.  No, she divorces him first.  How can you seriously be encouraging anyone to stay with their rapist?  It blows my mind!  If a man rapes his wife, he clearly doesn't respect or care about her or listen to her, and it sounds like she'd be better off without him.  If a man rapes you, he does not deserve you.  If anyone rapes you, they don't deserve you.  This is not just a man and woman thing, it can affect any and all genders.  But this is exactly why Laurie's way of living is so dangerous, because she makes women reliant on a single man in their lives.  She doesn't encourage women to ever develop the skills or get the means to be independent or look after themselves.  She tells them, it's easier to stay with your husband than being alone.  She literally encourages staying with an abuser over being an independent person.  And that is so dangerous, it is so bad.  And then she goes on to do some, you know, classic victim blaming.  Ugh.  In my opinion, she should have given him sex when he asked that night, since we aren't to deprive our husbands.  She could have asked him if it would be okay to wait until the morning, too, if she felt too exhausted.  but at least let him know she will give it to him very soon.  I know that many wives are depriving their husbands sexually on a continual basis, and they are in sin.  Well, in my opinion, you're a disgusting human being, Laurie.  Sex is never just about the man.  It's never just about one person.  Sex is for everyone involved, no matter who or how many partners you're with.  Everyone involved should be consenting and getting enjoyment from the experience.  No matter who you are or what relationship you're in, you never owe anybody sex and no one ever owes you sex.  Sorry, we have a grumbly Kyra.  She wants to go out and play.  I know.  It's a sunny day, isn't it?  I know.  I'll take you out soon.  Promise.  As soon as I finish, dear.  I love you.  Anyway, as I was saying, your body is yours to do with as you wish.  You shouldn't ever have to just lay back and take it to make someone else happy.  You have every right to say no without conditions or reason.  If you don't want to have sex, you don't have sex.  It's that simple.  And no one has any right to question you or add conditions to that or anything.  You should never have to say no because or no, not right now, but later.  Just know is enough.  And if that isn't enough for your partner, then maybe that partner's not good enough for you.  So he divorces her and remarries.  Her marriage is destroyed.  She's left alone to support herself and her children, if she has any, just because I told her that her husband was committing marital rape because he was having sex with her one time during the middle of the night.  Yeah, you know what?  If all that happened, that woman would be a million times better off than staying with a rapist.  It's better to be alone and independent and safe and with your self-respect than to live a lie with a rapist who hurt, abused, and disrespected you.  But Laurie admits that she won't do this.  And I think this is because she as an individual is scared to be alone.  And so she assumes everyone else will be as well and tries to push the lifestyle that she has that she's, I guess, comfortable with or because she's, you know, too scared to live any other life.  She tries to push the life she has on everyone else and assumes that everyone else is the same as her with the same fears and wants and so on.  It's like she's encouraging and expecting and wanting everyone else to be just as scared as she is and that's a pretty disgusting way to live.  I am in the business of restoring marriages and trying to make them better.  I am sure there are many wives who would admit that their husbands have woken them up in the middle of the night trying to have sex with them.  It's not that big of a deal.  It is a big deal.  Just because it's happened to other people, just because it's happened before, that doesn't make it okay.  And we shouldn't allow it to keep happening.  These appeal to traditional popularity fallacies are literally a bunch of crap.  Imagine if I turned around to you and I was like, I'm sure there are many people who've been enslaved.  It's not that big of a deal.  Look, I'm sure there are many people who get racial slurs, you know, shouted at them every day.  It's not that big of a deal.  I'm sure there are many paedophiles out there abusing children.  It's not that big of a deal.  Do you see how ridiculous her statement is?  She ends her blog post with, \"'Wives, don't deprive your husband sexually.  God is very clear about not doing  this.'\".  most husbands married because they want to have sex on a regular basis.  one reason for marrying is that it is better to marry than to burn.  be wise in the counsel you give to other women.  always fight for marriages rather than tear them down.  can we just talk about how?  this is the most disgusting reason for marriage ever to have sex because you're scared of burning in hell.  It's so weird.  It's literally just making women into objects for sex and that's disgusting.  And yet someone like Laurie looks at me and says that I'm a terrible person, I'm disgusting, I deserve to suffer for eternity because I'm the bad one for thinking that marriage should be about partnership and friendship and building a life together and not just using a woman for sex.  How am I the bad guy in that?  To make this even more disgusting, again when she got backlash for this, she followed up with a second blog post which was again literally victim blaming, just like doubling down on that screw the victim stuff.  She says, Everyone is up in arms about the man's wrongdoing, yet hardly anyone but a few mentioned anything about the wife's wrongdoing, saying no to him for no good reason.  She just didn't feel like it.  He was not physically or sexually abusive towards her, and she had never been sexually abused in the past.  Denying her husband's sexual intimacy is against God's instructions to her.  I don't understand a wife who would claim that this happening one time in her marriage could be considered marital rape.  Laurie, I'm utterly disgusted by you.  I thoroughly hope no women ever listen to your advice because it's dangerous and harmful.  If there are any people out there, whether you're men or women or non-binary, it doesn't matter.  If someone has been sexually intimate with you without your consent, that is not okay.  But it's also not your fault.  And that's... what I want people to take away from this video.  This idea of making excuses and apologies for rapists, blaming the victim, it's not okay, no matter what your justification is.  And I'm thoroughly disgusted that Laurie is doing this.  And that's why I wanted to make this video today.  I know this was kind of intense, but it needed to be made, it needed to be said.  Hopefully we can share this message with more people and kind of get it out there.  Anyway, thank you for watching today.  If you're new here, it would be amazing if you subscribe.  We do more videos like this, kind of like, debunking dodgy ideas like this and also lots of atheism stuff and like debunking religious stuff and i talk a lot about like science and history and little bits of like social stuff.  um i'm a huge fan of books and dogs and painting and photography so they come up fairly often as well.  i'm really into my makeup and fun stuff like that.  so there's lots of stuff here if you're new here.  otherwise youtube have been doing a big clear out of subs recently so My subs have gone down again, which is a little bit sad.  And also I've had reports from people saying that, you know, they thought they were subscribed to me, but they've been unsubscribed by YouTube.
