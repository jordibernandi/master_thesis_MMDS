            "text": "The way you see God decides what you believe God does, what you believe God loves, and what you believe God blesses, where His favor will be.  So I couldn't encourage any leader who wants to live purposefully and who wants to build a church that reflects the heart of God, I couldn't encourage you more.  to make sure that your view of the Master is through a New Covenant, New Testament lens, that we look at the Old Testament, which is so full of beauty and power and example and wonder and is so much of the whole tenor of God's message, that we need to look at it through the lens of, resurrection and the cross and back into it from where we stand now and not from where they stood then because otherwise it's going to affect your ability to be purposeful and building and leading and bringing release and bringing freedom and seeing those things God puts in your heart come to pass.  how do you view God in a desert?  there's two types of birds there's vultures and there's hummingbirds.  one lives off dead carcasses rotting meat and The other lives off the beautiful sweet nectar in a particular flower on a particular desert plant.  In the same desert, they both find what they're looking for.  You know, take it all the way back into the Old Testament and the Muslim and you, we actually serve the same God, Allah, to a Muslim.  To us, Abba Father, God.  And of course, through history, those views have changed greatly.  But let's make sure that we view God through the eyes of Jesus, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the beauty of a savior, the loving, open, inclusive arms of a loving God.  And that way we'll lead out of that and you'll be purposeful about your leadership and you'll draw people just like the Lord Jesus always does through the power of the Holy Spirit.  First two, here's the second point.  They were committed to increasing the master's domain.  The third one had no interest in what was important to the master.  The first two, they were committed to increasing or advancing the master's domain.  So the master, he had entrusted them.  One with five, one with two.  They took what they were given.  They increased it.  The third, he had no interest in what was important to the master.  He was just afraid.  So he took what he was given, hid it in the ground, said, here, here's back what is yours.  He never increased anything.  Well, if I think about Jesus, our master, and what's important to him, because as pastors and leaders, we want to increase the master's domain.  We want to live according to what is important to him.  And it's fairly simple what Jesus loves.  Jesus loves the Father.  Jesus loves the world.  Jesus loves the lost.  Jesus loves the church.  Jesus loves the poor.  That's pretty much it. ",
