            "text": "So I told you yesterday about repo madness, what was happening in the banking community.  And if you if you paid attention yesterday on what was you know what we were talking about and what was happening.  There was a problem at the banks where they have this overnight lending system.  And all of the banks have to have a certain amount of cash on hand.  And they do this every night.  They look and say, how much money do we have in the bank?  You know what?  Call Citibank and ask them if we can borrow, you know, $10 billion.  We'll sell them this and we'll buy it back tomorrow morning.  Happens all the time.  Banks loan each other money all the time.  Now, back in 2008, Bear Stearns started asking for money and the other banks were like, now you're asking for an awful lot of money.  I'm not really sure you're too healthy.  And so they started going to what was called the discount window, where they could go to the Fed in the middle of the night.  But nobody wanted to go to the discount window, because the discount window was really, it was the walk of shame.  If you went to that window, the other banks would know that you were in trouble.  So Bear Stearns went to the discount window, and the Fed said, okay, we'll write you some cash, okay?  Just to keep them afloat.  Just to keep everything going.  But don't worry, nothing to see here.  Nothing to see here.  As the crash started to happen, there was a credit crunch.  Not with you.  The banks, you could still, everything seemed normal.  Kind of like, oh, I don't know, right now.  where everything seemed normal.  But at night, the banks were in full-fledged panic because they had to have a certain amount of money in the bank every night to cover everything.  And what normally goes on is Bank of America will call Citibank or Citibank will call JPMorgan Chase or whatever, and they'll work it out.  And they say, hey, can you just transfer some of your money, and I'm going to transfer this asset over to you, and then tomorrow we'll reverse that.  Not a problem.  Until every bank in 2008 was freaking out because they, none of them had enough money to cover their expenses.  And the first sign of trouble is the overnight interest rate, which should be 1.75.  The overnight interest rate when the bank goes and says, hey, I want to buy a new house.  Except what they're really saying is, hey, I don't have enough money in my vault to cover the stuff that I just bought.  Can you just borrow?  Can I borrow some money for the overnight?  And the banks say, sure, 1.75.  The credit crunch became so bad as of Monday that the interest rate that the banks were selling each other these loans for the overnight was 10%.  Imagine you borrow $10 billion from another bank in the overnight and you have to pay 10% on that money.  That's not going to go well or last long.  And the reason why it was 10% was because no one had enough money.  They were all calling each other.  Hey, could you loan me some money?  I don't know.  I can't.  Of course, I'll find it if you pay me 10% in the morning.  That's what was happening.  So the Federal Reserve knew this.  And so they just casually made an announcement.  Hey, nothing to see here, nothing to worry about.  But we're going to loan $55 trillion, sorry, billion dollars, $55 billion to the banks tonight.  And we're just going to do it tonight.  Well, it came back that they needed, the banks needed $65 billion for the night.  Then the next night, the Fed decided to do it again, and so they offered $65 billion.  Well, they needed $75 billion.  Every time they opened the, quote, discount window, every time they made these purchases of assets.  By the way, they're not paying them back the next day.  They're just buying these assets.  Every time they did that, they needed more.  So they kept doing it.  Remember, this is only going to happen Monday night.  They did it again last night.  They've done it Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Thursday night, and they're going to do it again tonight.  So that is, that's where we were.  That's what I told you yesterday.  This is so critically important that you pay attention.  So where are we?  Well, the $75 billion per day from the Fed extended last night into day four.  We are now at $350 billion that has been injected into the U.S.  investment banks in four days, and the banks are still asking for more.  The markets are not functioning if the banks need $75 billion a day in new cash just for their day-to-day operations.  JPMorgan Chase has taken $52 billion in cash and new capital from the Fed in three days.  That is 22% of what the entire company is worth.  That's their market cap, 22%.  And they borrowed that cash or took that cash in three days.  The world's largest investment bank needing $12.5 billion every day in newly printed cash from the Fed to provide cash on the books.  In 2007, the initial bid from Lehman Brothers was $620 million.  Six days later, 120-year-old company, 11,200 employees, 8.9 million investors worth $14 billion in market cap was gone.  We have a problem here.  We have a real problem.  In four days, they have given out almost half of what we argued about.  We argued all week long that week when we had to rush this through.  It was the thing that caused the Tea Party really to stand up.  Wait a minute, you're bailing these banks out.  What about everybody else?  They're doing it now quietly and they've already spent half of the cash that they spent for TARP.  And they did that in four days.  And no one is talking about it.  There is a real problem with the banks.  We're not talking just Lehman Brothers now.  We are talking all of the banks.  But wait, let's talk about blackface.  Wait, there's rain in Houston.  You know, it's climate hysteria day.  We've got to get Trump's tax returns in California.  Oh, we've got to get all of the ARs back.  Don't you even say that we're talking about confiscating ARs.  We're not talking about that.  Yes, you are.  No, you're not.  Yes, you are.  No, you aren't.  Meanwhile, the banks are in trouble.  Are you awake?  Last night, Marianne Williamson gave the answer of the decade.  This is exactly what is happening in all of our society.  Last night, Marianne Williamson was asked by a college student, what is your problem with?  What is your problem with nuclear energy? ",

What do you identify as the problems with nuclear energy?  And what do you say to those who think it simply gets a bad reputation? ",
