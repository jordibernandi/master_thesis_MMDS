We can come with multiple arguments that together will bring up a very, very strong case for the existence of a God.  There are many arguments, and probably the most powerful ones that we have right now are the cosmological argument.  and the fine-tuning argument.  Those, to me, are two of the most powerful ways in which I can show people that there really is a God. ",

The fine-tuning argument, essentially, also uses the observations of our universe to see how all of the constants in the universe are so well tuned, to use the same word, so well crafted, designed for us to be here, essentially talking to each other at this point.
