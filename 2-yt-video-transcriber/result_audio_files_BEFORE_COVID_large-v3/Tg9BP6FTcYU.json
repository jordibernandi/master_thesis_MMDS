            "text": "First and foremost, I want to give all honor and praise to the Most High, Yahuwah, for sparing my life and giving me another opportunity to share in his word.  I also want to say what an honor it is to be a part of Season 10 of Debate Talk for You.  And I want to thank you, Brother Sal, for being a laborer among us and your dedication to the work of the Most High.  And I thank my opponent, Messenger of Truth, who actually issued this challenge.  And finally, the listening audience for taking time out of your busy schedules to listen to this debate.  Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent came out here in the hopes of winning a debate.  Well, I'm here not just to debate, but more importantly, to educate.  The question being asked tonight is, is the Trinity pagan?  And my answer to that is a definite yes.  As Hebrews, we have a standard that we should live by, and that can be found in the book of Yeshayahu, or Isaiah chapter 8, verse 20.  There it says to the Torah and to the testimony, if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.  This simply means if a certain doctrine or tradition of man cannot be supported by the Torah of Almighty Yah or the testimony of the prophets, it's because there's no light or truth in it.  Nowhere in the Torah of Almighty Yah or in the testimony of the Nabim or the prophets do you see a reference to Yahuwah Almighty as a trinity, nowhere.  First of all, the majority of Hebrews listening tonight, and even some of you Christians, you realize something.  You realize that Christmas has pagan roots.  You also realize that the word Christmas cannot be found in the Bible.  Why am I bringing this up?  Because just like Christmas, the concept of the trinity has pagan roots.  Just like the word Christmas The word Trinity is found nowhere in the Bible.  So since it is not found in the set-apart scriptures of Yah, it begs the question, where does it come from?  Well, just like Christmas, the Trinity doctrine is an ancient pagan doctrine that finds its roots in Babylonian mystery religion.  And it originated with the worship of Nimrod, Semiramis, and Tammuz.  I'm going to give a very brief history, but this information is easily accessible online.  Nimrod was a great grandson of Noah and is credited in Genesis chapter 10, verses 8 through 12, as the founder of the first world empire at Babel.  Nimrod was regarded as a king.  Semiramis was the wife of Nimrod, and she promoted the belief that Nimrod was a god.  After his death, Semiramis promoted the idea that Nimrod had resurrected and become a sun god.  She claims that she became pregnant by the impregnated rays of the sun.  And then she brought forth a child named Tammuz.  She claimed that Tammuz was Nimrod reincarnated.  She would then be known as the mother of God.  Now I'm asking you audience, does any of this sound familiar?  Are we seeing the beginning of a satanic counterfeit?  What we see as a result of all of this is Nimrod, Semiramis, and Tammuz would be the first historical trinity to be worshipped as gods.  And As a side note, the name Nimrod means rebellion.  Now, this Babylonian mystery religion has been passed down throughout the ages through different cultures, which is why in virtually all cultures across the world, you find a similar version of this story of a triad of gods.  You have the Egyptian culture, which had Osiris, Isis, and Horus.  The Romans had Jupiter, Juno, and Mars.  The Greeks had Zeus, Hera, and Hercules.  The Hindus have Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.  And now, in our days, this pagan doctrine of a three-in-one God system has been promoted by the pagan Roman Catholic Church and her protesting daughters, which is none other than the Protestant churches.  Now, one of the definitions of a pagan is someone who doesn't worship the one true almighty of scripture, but worships several deities.  They are considered polytheistic.  And whether you realize it or not, listening audience, the Trinity is a satanic device used to split up the one true Elohim of Scripture into a trio of separate but co-equal gods.  The general definition of the Trinity holds that God is one God but three co-eternal consubstantial persons or hypostases, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as one God in three divine persons.  It says that three persons are distinct, yet are one substance, essence, or nature.  How can three separate and distinct persons be one?  Listening audience, the Trinity Doctrine is designed to get Bible believers all around the world to practice a pagan polytheistic belief without even realizing.  In Revelation 12, verse 9, we are told that Satan has indeed deceived the whole world.  Now, for those of you who don't know, my opponent tonight, the messenger of truth, is a Christian who's made it his personal crusade to squash the Hebrew-Israelite movement.  The Hebrew-Israelite movement is simply the awakening of Yah's people all across the earth.  They're awakening to the truth in his word, the truth about his name, his Sabbath, his Torah, his feasts.  My opponent tonight, he views this awakening as false.  He views it as a falling away from the church.  Messenger of Truth calls the black Hebrew-Israelites a New Age cult, He's accused me of being part of a sacred name cult because I call on the name of Yahuwah.  He also says I promote the oneness doctrine because I don't believe in the false trinity.  So tonight he's going to try his hardest to prove to you that the trinity is biblical.  Now let me make this clear.  I believe in the Father.  I believe in the Son.  And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Ruach HaKodesh.  But to call these three manifestations of Yahuwah a trinity is error.  Many of you listening understand that Christianity is a pagan religion, a counterfeit.  It looks real, but it's fake.  There are some of you that are listening tonight who are just waking up to this truth.  I encourage you that as you listen to both sides tonight, compare what we are saying to what you see in the Scripture.  Use the Scripture as the measuring stick, and most of all, pray for knowledge, wisdom, and understanding.  As Hebrews, we know that the Christian doctrine teaches and what the Scriptures teach are totally opposite.  For instance, as Hebrews observed the Sabbath day, The pagan Christian church observes Sunday.  We observe the feasts and appointments of Yahuwah.  The pagan Christian church has Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day.  Yahuwah in his word tells us, which means, hear Israel, Yahuwah is one.  He is telling you in his word, he is one.  But the pagan Christian church, on the other hand, tells you that God is a trinity.  Well, God might be a trinity, but I'm here to tell you, listening audience, that Yahuwah, the only true and living Elohim, is not a trinity.  He is one.  So I go through all of that with the hope that you, as the listening audience, are getting the big picture.  Yahuwah says one thing in his word, and the pagan son worshiping Christian church has come along and said, no, trust our word and our doctrine instead.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Apostle Saul, commonly called Paul, said that there would be a falling away from the truth.  In the second book of Thessalonians, chapter 2, the Apostle talks about this falling away.  Many think that this falling away would happen only in these end times, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Satan hasn't taken a 2,000-year vacation.  He's been hard at work perverting the true way from the very beginning.  Paul warned in 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, verse 7, that he had already seen the mystery of iniquity already at work during this time.  Now what does iniquity mean?  It means lawlessness.  Satan hates the law, also known as the Torah of Almighty Yah.  So it should come as no surprise that he has operated through the Christian church to do away with the Torah or the law of the Most High.  And it should come as no surprise to you that what Satan hates the most is the greatest commandment.  Turn with me to the book of Mark chapter 12.  We're going to start at verse 28.  I'm reading from the ISR scriptures.  There it says, And one of the scribes coming near, hearing them reasoning together, knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first command of all?  Yahushua answered him, The first of all the commands is, Hear, O Yahshua, Yahuwah our Elohim, Yahuwah is one.  Now, do you notice what Yahushua just recited?  He recited the Shema found in Devarim or Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 4.  He then goes on to say in verse 30, and ye shall love Yahuwah your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being and with all your mind and with all your strength.  This is the first command.  Do we see what Yahushua did, audience?  He linked the Shema with the very first commandment because both have to do with our love and loyalty to the one and only true Elohim.  Let's look at the scribe's response in verse 32.  The scribe said to him, well said, teacher, you have spoken the truth, for there is one Elohim.  And there's no other besides him.  I want you to notice what the scribe said.  He agreed with Yahushua and said, there is one Elohim.  Now let's see Yahushua's reaction.  Does Yahushua say, wait, hold on.  There is one Elohim, but he is really three in one.  And I am the second person in that group.  Let's see what Yahushua says in verse 34.  And when Yahushua saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, you are not far from the reign of Elohim.  And after that, no one was bold enough to question him.  Yahushua said to the scribes, you are not far from the reign of Elohim.  Audience, faith, belief, amunah, all these words mean trusting in Yahuwah's word.  If we just take Yahuwah at his word, if you believe what he says and live it, you are not far from the kingdom of Elohim.  But when you start listening to the words of men who claim to be messengers of truth, These so-called messengers will drag you further and further away from the kingdom until you wind up in a pit you can't come out of.  Yahushua said, Yahuwah is one.  He didn't say three in one.  He didn't say a trinity.  He said, Yahuwah is one.  Audience, my opponent, the messenger of truth, wants to drag you right back into the lawless ways of pagan Christianity.  Don't buy his lies.  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.  Don't take the baits.  In the book of 2 Peter 2, verse 1, he warns the believers, saying, But there are false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Master that bought them, and bringing upon themselves swift destruction.  One of these damnable heresies is the teaching of the Trinity.  The early assemblies were made up of many Yahudim, or Jews, who understood that Elohim is one, They would have understood that the idea of there being three persons in one was pagan.  They believed and understood that the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit are simply manifestations of the one and same, Elohim.  And as both the Apostle Shaul and Apostle Peter warned, these damnable heresies started to creep into the assemblies.  Satan was attacking the Torah of Yahuwah.  The Fourth Commandment was under attack.  The Third Commandment was under attack.  The second commandment was under attack, and finally the first commandment was under attack.  So by 120 AD, we start to see some of the writings of these so-called church fathers.  We see a church far different from the early assembly that we read about in the scriptures.  In 325 AD, Emperor Constantine called for a meeting of all the bishops of the so-called organized church to settle various disputes, such as Arianism and the nature of Christ.  Most of us already know that Constantine, though he called himself a Christian, was really a pagan sun worshiper.  And one year after convening this council, believe it or not, he had his own son murdered.  Constantine becoming a Christian was a political move, much the same way our U.S.  presidents claimed to be Christian, just to get the Christian vote.  Now, one of the disputes at this council was between Arius, a priest from Alexandria, who proposed that Christ was a created being and a lesser god.  Opposing this teaching was Athanasius.  His view was an early form of Trinitarianism.  Audience, both these men were in the wrong.  At this council, Arianism was rejected and Athanasius' view was approved.  Anyone who opposed the new view would be subject to death.  And this laid the groundwork for the church to accept the Trinity doctrine.  In the middle of the 4th century, three bishops trained in Greek philosophy I repeat, three bishops trained in Greek philosophy proposed the idea that God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit were co-equal and together in one being, yet also distinct from one another.  It should be an irony that the three bishops, three pagan bishops, brought about this Trinity doctrine.  Ladies and gentlemen, when we turn to the book of Hazuna, Revelation chapter 16, verse 13, it speaks of three unclean spirits like frogs, coming out of the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet.  Audience, these three unclean spirits represent the three-person Trinity teaching, which was introduced into the church in 325 A.D Notice the scriptures allude to the real Trinity, which is the dragon himself, the beast, and finally the false prophet.  At the Council of Constantinople in 381  A.D.,  The divinity of the Holy Spirit was affirmed, and the Trinity as generally understood today became the official belief in teaching concerning the nature of the Most High.  What I want you to see is this belief came about from Catholic church councils, not from the word of Almighty, Yah.  Satan hates the Torah of Yah, and what he hates most is the first commandment, which declares, Yahuwah is one.  With that I yield. ",
