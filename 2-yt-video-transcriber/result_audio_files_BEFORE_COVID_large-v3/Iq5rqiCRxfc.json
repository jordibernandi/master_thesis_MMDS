For example, on a flat earth map, if you want to go from LA to Sydney, you go northwest, not southwest.  The course plotted using the flat earth map will require much more fuel and take a lot longer.  It's a waste of time and money and has much greater environmental impact.  And if you're a big, evil, greedy airline, it should definitely concern you a lot that your competition might not waste their customers' time and charge them more because they actually use the correct map, which you don't.  And also, what if time is a critical issue?  Maybe a doctor is flying somewhere to perform a life-saving medical procedure.  Yes, Jordan, when you navigate, it really does matter what shape the Earth has.  When you predict the weather, we're talking about large-scale weather patterns moving over large distances.  And yes, it matters what those distances are if you want to have any chance of getting the prognosis right.  If we're talking about extreme weather like hurricanes, getting the prognosis completely wrong can actually cost lives.  So yes, again, it matters what shape the Earth has.  If you want to put satellites in orbit, perhaps for use in communication or navigation systems that we actually rely on, it matters what shape the Earth has, not to mention if it's covered by a firmament or not.  The fact that it doesn't matter to how we treat each other doesn't mean that it doesn't matter, period. ",
