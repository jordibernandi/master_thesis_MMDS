            "text": "Hey everyone, I just want to share with you some really good news.  Ezett and I and BabyElzebub and MayonnaiseDog and Cat are finally gonna be moving soon.  This is not some snap decision, this is not something that we just decided to do.  In fact, this was the entire reason I decided way back near the start of 2017 to walk out of my job and go full-time on YouTube.  We were planning to move back then, and I wanted to be freed up to do that.  But unfortunately, for a whole bunch of reasons, it didn't quite work out that way.  And so for this entire time, we've been just living with the problems that made us want to move in the first place.  And that was what that somewhat abandoned escape from hell plotline was really about.  Well, we're finally escaping from hell, as it were.  That's a bit of an overstatement, but we're escaping from a situation we don't really want to be in.  Being stuck in the middle of the city, which is an environment we both really hate.  Not having good access to schools, not having enough space for the three of us plus the pets in this little condo.  Not having space for a proper office, a proper studio, not having any quiet places to record, to write, to do anything.  Basically feeling like sardines in a can with no way out and going nowhere.  It honestly felt like we were never gonna get here.  It felt like something we were just gonna keep hoping for and never actually achieving.  And it hasn't been a fun couple of years as a result.  Like, all these different things and feeling like I couldn't push my family to where I wanted us to be really, really weighed heavy on me.  I mean, in 2018, it was an absolute nightmare until I started to work really hard to try to perceive things... at least in a more positive way, just so it wouldn't end in a terrible place.  And I managed that.  This has been a much better year.  But it's still been the same old thing.  Man, I sure hope we can get out of here.  You know, it's kind of a shitty situation as like a really introverted person like I am.  which is something that if you pay a lot of attention to my channel, you've probably figured out.  Being that kind of a person who gets drained really quickly from social situations, needs quiet time, needs to withdraw from people from time to time to recharge the batteries, I guess you'd say.  I feel like my batteries haven't been recharged in five years, and that's not saying anything negative about my family.  I love my family, and they know that.  But it's just, some people are like that.  It would have been different if this whole time, you know, we lived in a small house, but out in the country somewhere, or I could just walk outside, I don't know, go sit under a tree, you know?  But it's not like that here.  If you want to go out and get away from things, you go outside and there's 200 times more people out there.  This is a city of a million people.  But all those problems I think we've found a silver bullet solution for.  That's not to say that different problems might not arise in the future, I have no idea what the future holds, but I do know that we are moving to a place where I will be able to have a dedicated studio, a dedicated office, closeable, lockable, soundproofed, peaceful, where I can think, where I can write, where I.
