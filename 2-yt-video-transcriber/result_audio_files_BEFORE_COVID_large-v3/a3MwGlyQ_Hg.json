The judge can say, Vanessa's guilty, but someone's paid her fine.  She's out of here.  Well, just before Jesus died, he cried out, it is finished.  The debt has been paid.  In other words, God can freely forgive your sins.  He can dismiss your case, let you live forever, not because you're good or not because you're doing anything, but because he's rich in mercy.  And he provided a way for us to live forever through the suffering, death, and resurrection of the Savior.  If you repent and trust in Him, God will forgive every sin you've ever committed and grant you the gift of everlasting life.  Now, I know you've tried all these different religions and you've been so-called born again, but... Lots of Americans have had a born-again experience that's been fallacious.  It hasn't been genuine.  It's been spurious or false because they've never known sin in its true light.  And what I've tried to do today is share with you the serious nature of sin, that it's worthy of death, and that God is rich in mercy and offers everlasting life.  Now regarding hell, you brought up that very good point.  How do we know hell exists?  Well, we intuitively know God exists because of creation.  You said you believe in a creator.  We know the creator demands morality because we have a conscience.  And we believe in justice.  That's what separates us from the animals.  So if God is good, he must punish rapists and murderers and thieves.  But the Bible says he's so good, he's going to punish blasphemers and adulterers and fornicators and liars.  And that's why we all need a savior.  And Vanessa, you've been so gracious to me.  You've let me talk and you've been patient with me.  And I want to thank you for that.
