I don't have an ID, but I have my SDA permit.  That's all I need to have right at this point in time.  Okay.  Can I see that, please?  It's displayed.  SDA says I don't have to surrender.  Oh, okay.  Sorry about that.  It gets kicked around.  That's it right there.  Well, I only have to display it.  Okay, well, I have to see it, sir.  It's right there for you to see.  Okay, well, I need to see it, and I'm not stepping any closer to you when you've got two arms on me.  I understand.  Okay.  Do me a favor.  Unclip it.

I mean, I'm all one for walks, but that's a long ways.  Ah, yeah.  Well, I'm going to meet up with some people, and there I am.  We'll probably go shoot in their backyard or something.  Okay.  Hopefully not in Midwest City.  Nope, not in Midwest City.  So what's the purpose in taking my name down?  Because we got a call on you.  Yep.  Walking down the road.  So I got to say who I was out with and who I talked to.  All right.  Well, after November 1st, we won't need those little IDs.  Right.  Yep.  I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  I'm glad that you actually went through the training.  We got a lot of people that don't.  Yep.  I've been through it.  Which one did you go through?  I went through Emil Edwards.
