Theophilus MacPherson, the man with the coolest name in the world otherwise known by his alias, Theophilus Fernandez, the man with not quite as cool a name, had by sheer coincidence told me his hot takes on Valentine's Day, the day of bestiality, in honor of some old Catholic pimpstitute, and Christmas Day, the day of smoking weed and having orgies, plural.  Well, I thought.  Well, well, well, I thought.  Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, I thought.  Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, I thought.  Well, well, I stopped myself before I finished that one, realizing that my brain was a little bit fried from my whirlwind house move and everything else, which explained the video that was about to play.  Well, well, well, I thought, that's two holidays down.  Maybe Theophilus has some insight on some other holidays.  Maybe there's something else we atheists should know.  I like to stay on top of things.  It's my job.  Perhaps, I thought, blowing a few bubbles from my pipe to indicate my sophistication.  Perhaps a good place to start would be with Theophilus' Ten Reason How to Have a Successful Thanksgiving Day.  I could hear the chatter from the audience already.  Responding to a Thanksgiving video now, wasn't it a little late?  Or early?  They have little vision.  I flicked the switch on the side of my fedora to silence the premonitions of comments to come and pushed forward, free of petty constraints like relevancy of topics and timeliness of videos.  After all, this was Logict, where a response material aged like mysterious women who aged like fine wine.  At first I wasn't sure if Theophilus knew his camera was on. ",

I said, panicked at the thought of listening to the entire list a second time.  Before he could answer, I quickly went to search for a different holiday.  Easter.  But when I did, I found something unexpected.  Why people join the lodge, P1.  This was surprising.  The lodge happened to be the name of my Discord server.  Everyone should join.  that, I thought to myself, since I plan to use it more heavily through the 20s.  I decided to abandon the holiday premise because this was more interesting. ",

There were very few members of the lodge who said they were Christian.  Of course, Christians were welcome.  We weren't assholes.  But they tended not to show up too often, for obvious reasons.

It was mostly used by degenerates for disgusting furry porn.  Oh sure, we had no problem with degeneracy, but we didn't really want it splashed all over the other channels, so we limited it to the blood orgy, at least in visual form.  Then we wouldn't have to see it.  That seemed reasonable.  The average person could only take so many wolf dongs.  Man, the past tense thing's a lot harder with this bit.  I muttered to myself.  Maybe it's time to finally break free.  I took my notepad from my pocket and read it.  Everybody is somebody.  Remind people you have a Patreon, it said.  I had limited space, so I erased those, the last one reluctantly.  I really wanted to remind people of that.  And I began to scribble ideas for my escape plan.  An inspiring montage played as I worked for days and weeks, burning through pencils and writing smaller and smaller on my itty-bitty notepad as it became nearly worn through by my eraser.  A couple minutes later, just long enough to feel satisfying but short enough to keep the viewer's interest, the montage ended.  and i had my plan.  i stood up solemnly ready to do what had to be done leapt up with my fist in the air and freeze-framed a long series of expensive dramatic scenes.  later with a great deal of intrigue mystery and blood i was back to normal not trapped in those stupid quotation marks and not a turkey ready for the oven.  i'd won.  it was exciting.  the audience loved it.  i got an audience score of a hundred on rotten tomatoes.
