            "text": "Good damn morning, Americans.  Jericho Green here with you once again.  I got two things I want to talk about.  Damn it.  So I saw a headline.  Actually, a buddy of mine texted me about it last night.  Then I read the article today that the San Francisco 49ers have suspended one of their broadcasters.  They suspended one of their color commentators.  And here's the irony in that title.  So this guy named Tim Ryan, he's a former NFL player.  Great at his job.  I love to listen to him call the games when he does interviews on local sports talk radio and shit.  Dude's awesome.  He's funny.  He's intelligent.  Great timing.  So the other day, I think Tuesday, I'm listening to sports talk radio because I'm going somewhere and I'm at a spot where I don't get cell phone reception.  So I usually switch over.  I usually listen to either sports during football season or this other station out of San Francisco, San Francisco called KGO.  People, I don't know if you can get this online or if you're ever in the area, but you want to hear some crazy fuckers on the radio in terminal stages of TDS?  KGO 810 AM out of San Francisco.  Holy shit.  Sometimes I listen to them just to see what the enemy's doing.  And every time I tune in, they're talking about Trump.  Yesterday I tuned in and the first word I heard was Trump.  It was fucking crazy.  They said that nobody can work for Trump with a clear conscience.  That's one of the things they said.  But anyway.  So Tim Ryan, I'm listening to him.  He's on the morning show called Murph and Mac, and they're talking about the 49ers game on Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens.  Now, the quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens, for people that don't know, is this kid named Lamar Jackson, second-year player.  And Lamar Jackson is dark skin.  Don't worry, it plays in.  So Tim Ryan is talking about the game.  And one of the ways that Lamar Jackson is so successful is he's a running quarterback.  He can throw too, but that boy can run.  So sometimes he'll fake to hand off the ball to the running back, but then he'll keep it and take off the other way.  So Tim Ryan was talking about that, and he said that, yeah, man, the Baltimore Ravens jerseys are black.  The ones they were wearing were black.  So he said, you know, with Lamar's skin color and the ball against those dark-colored jerseys, man, and it was raining, it was inclement weather, he said.  sometimes it's hard to see where the ball is.  Now, when he said that, he was calling in the hosts of the show, You could hear him kind of take a pause, and Tim kind of paused too because he was expecting them to jump in and say something.  He was giving a break in what he was saying for them to jump in and respond to it.  But you could tell they didn't respond.  Tim kind of paused, but then he kept going for a split second.  You could hear it.  You could feel that shit.  And I knew it.  I was like, oh, man, I hope he doesn't get in trouble for that.  What he said was true.  Lamar's dark skin, the ball's dark brown, and their jerseys were dark.  It's hard to see the ball, especially in that weather.  All true.  All right, hold on.  Let me fact check it.  Yes, all three things are true.  But people, Tim Ryan forgot that we are now down the rabbit hole of 2019 post-Trump apocalyptic, Mad Max, super sensitive environment.  That's where we live now.  And now the truth is taboo.  The truth is socially outlawed.  You can't speak the truth.  Especially when you're referring to a POC.  What's that?  A person of color.  Because as you know, Colored folk are the Faberge eggs of ethnicities.  You have to be very careful, very quiet, and very gentle when you're around them.  You got to treat them like you're in the house with a sleeping baby.  Walk lightly.  Shh, don't slam the door.  Don't turn on the microwave.  When you ever close the door to a sleeping child's room, You turn that knob and you pull that door to real quiet, real gentle.  And you let that knob go and hope it doesn't make a sound.  That's how you got to treat black folks, apparently.  So because he had the nerve to tell the truth about a black athlete, he got suspended.  Motherfucker, man.  But you know what?  It makes sense because the station is out of San Francisco.  What is San Francisco?  Well.  Aside from the, if the belly of the beast had a dirty butthole, that's San Francisco.  The place where you can shit on the street and give people AIDS.  No lie.  So, of course, they had to suspend them.  And that's fucked up, man.  Why?  Why are people losing income for telling the truth?  That is such fucking bullshit, man.  He's dark-skinned, the ball's dark, the jersey's dark.  It makes sense.  But I wish I had sound from that moment, because you could tell.  They were like, oh, shit.  And he was like, oh, you guys aren't going to talk?  And he kept going.  And... I'm assuming because they have one of the interns in there is this black girl.  So I'm assuming they were just like, oh, fuck, I'm so sorry.  That girl probably got a written apology from the whole staff.  Like, calm the fuck down, man.  Why is this even a thing?  But like I said, man, as soon as I heard it, I was like, oh, fuck.  And Tim is great at his job.  He is great at his job.  And because he did his job so well, he's suspended and won't be able to cover the game this weekend.  Man, if I were him, I'd be like, fuck you guys.  I ain't coming back.  I'll go to another company that will appreciate my truth telling.  This is a fucking garbage time that we live in as far as shit like that goes.  You can get suspended for telling the truth.  Anyway.  On to something else.  that's pretty stupid.  Well, not the thing that's happening, but people's reaction to it, of course.  So Trump is tightening the reins on welfare again.  Good.  Right.  So now because of the new rules.  Almost 700,000 people will likely lose their access to welfare.  Now, if you listen to these dummies talk about it, some official, she's a Democrat, I can't remember, she has something to do with nutrition or some bullshit in the government, probably an Obama holdover.  And speaking of that, why didn't Trump walk in there the very first day after he was inaugurated and say, hey, Get everybody.  I don't care if you got to go to a damn auditorium.  Go somewhere big enough where you can fit everybody in there.  You should say, hey, were you hired by Obama?  If you were hired by Obama, put your hand in the air.  I put my hand up.  I was hired by him.  Good.  You're all fired.  Get the fuck out of here.  Why didn't he do that?  That's one thing I don't understand is why Trump didn't completely clean house of all these fucking Obama holdovers.  As far as I'm concerned, if you work for Obama, you're an enemy to what I'm trying to do here.  Get the fuck out.  Why don't you go leak that?  Anyway.  So this woman's like, oh, this is so terrible and it's going to make times even harder on people who are already starving and poor and can't work and families and children.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, dumbass.  You soft-headed dirt fucker.  That's not what's going on here.  See?  They spin it.  They start tugging at those heartstrings.  The people are like, what?  He's taking food away from starving children?  No, he's bad.  Orange Man even more bad now.  Number one, what the fuck are your kids starving, you piece of shit?  If your kids are hungry, you are a fucking turd.  This country has too much food for anybody to be starving, especially your kids.  If you're a man and your kids are starving, you need to be kicked in your nuts until you stop that.  And if you're a woman and your kids are starving, somebody should take a rubber band and snap you in your titty until you stop that.  What the fuck?  All the damn food, restaurants and shit throw away every day and your kids are starving?  Any fucking way.  This is not targeting families.  It's targeting working age people between the ages of 18 and 49 who are able-bodied and mentally stable.  Hold up.  If you're between the ages of 18 and 49, you have no mental or physical disabilities, why the fuck are you on welfare in the first place?  They need to treat welfare like the NFL combine.  You need to stand there in your underwear and they check you out.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Your body looks able to meet.  Get your ass in the workforce.  Come on in, guys.  The water's fine in the workforce pool.  It's a nice, warm 80 degrees.  Come on in.  The fuck are you on welfare for if you're 18 to 49 with no issues?  How does that even happen?  You're damn right.  you should be kicked off of welfare.  And as it stands, before these new rules take effect, they are only required to work 20 hours a week for three months out of the year to qualify for welfare.  How the fuck is that?  I work two jobs.  20 hours a week ain't shit.  And you're able-bodied with no mental issues?  How did you even get on there?  Why is this even a discussion?  If you're in that age group and mentally and physically able-bodied and able-minded, if that's a fucking term, you shouldn't be allowed on welfare.  But Jericho, I'm a working student.  I don't give a fuck.  Cut back your classes.  Do what you gotta do.  But your ass shouldn't be on welfare.  if you can work.  Go to work.  Trump's made so many jobs out here, it's sickening.  Our national unemployment is under 4%.  Get your fucking ass out there and get to work.  Look at me driving to work and the fucking sun ain't even up yet.  And you're sitting there kicking it with your thumb in your ass, working 20 hours a fucking week.  Man, 20 hours is only half of my work week.  Not even half.  Man, what silly shit?  Who would be opposed to this?  Other than the lazy fuckers on welfare, who would be opposed to getting able-bodied young people out there to work?  My jaw was agape when I was reading this story.  They're families and they're starving and they're poor.  There are no fucking starving people in America.  If you're starving in America, that's by choice.  You're like one of those people who are, they call them trans-paralyzed or some shit, who like get a limb cut off because they identify as a paralyzed person.  You're like those sick fuckers.  They're only paralyzed because they want to be.  the fuck are you only on welfare because you want to be on welfare?  you're only starving or poor because you want to be the land of fucking opportunity.  people float over here on a damn inflated with damn floaties on their arms with 12 cents in their pocket and in six months they own a fucking business.  what's wrong with you?  shit makes me sick man taking all this money out of my damn check taking your EB card and buying kombucha and organic wild-caught shrimp on my fucking dime.  Man, open that bag up.  Give me some of those shrimp.  Those are mine.  I paid for that shit.  This is fucking ridiculous, man.  You got all these people paying for people who should be out here helping us pay.  Now, elderly and children, I got a lot more wiggle room for that.  I don't mind taking care of them.  But if you're anywhere in between and you don't have any mental or physical issues, fuck you.  Get your lazy ass to work.  There ought to be a squad of people that go around snatching blankets off of sleeping lazy motherfuckers and make them go to work.  The hell?  Everybody sitting in their damn car or on a train right now listening to this should be as pissed as I am.  Because you're headed the same place as me, and those fuckers are still drooling on their pillows.  Or putting in their headsets to play the new PS4.  Call of Duty, dude.  Let's play some Call of Duty.  Why don't you play some, get your fucking ass up and go to work, you turd.  Well, thanks for that.  Now that my blood pressure's through the fucking roof, let me go to work so I can help that lazy piece of shit.  stay home and play his Xbox.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.  Please subscribe.  Hit that notification bell because every time it rings, a piece of shit.  liberal cries.
