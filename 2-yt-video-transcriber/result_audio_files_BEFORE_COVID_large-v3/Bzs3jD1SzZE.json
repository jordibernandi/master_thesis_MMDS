            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Yerushalayim, from Jerusalem, Israel.  We're living in prophetic and exciting times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  The veil is being lifted.  2 Corinthians 3, verse 16.  And Jews and Arabs are being saved like never before.  There is a revival in Israel.  All glory goes to the King of kings and Lord of lords, Jesus Yeshua.  It is often shocking to many Jews in Israel and around the world when they see the Bible records everything that was, everything there is, and everything that will come to pass.  As most Jews read the Bible under rabbinic interpretation.  so they have books that interpret the bible and books that interpret the books that interpret the bible such as the zohar such as the gemara such as the talmud.  all these books are written by rabbis that do not believe in yeshua in jesus and are not written under the inspiration of the holy spirit.  on the contrary they are against the written word of god.  when we preach the gospel in israel And show the people the written word of God in context.  That everything that Yeshua did is in the Bible.  They're shocked.  And many times the veil is being lifted.  Many times they get on their knees and call on the name of Yeshua, Jesus, as their personal Savior.  Jesus Yeshua died on the cross on the tree for our sins.  He rose on the third day.  And all those who call on his name, repent and believe, shall be saved.  In the book of Luke, chapter 23, verse 46, Yeshua, Jesus, called out with a loud voice, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.  When he had said this, he breathed.  His last.  To Jews who do not believe in Yeshua, in Jesus, this is a Christian concept.  The truth of the matter is, there's no more Jewish message than this.  We began sharing Psalms 31 verse 5 all through Jerusalem, Yerushalayim.  Into your hands I commit my spirit.  Deliver me, Lord, my faithful God.  As the Messiah of Israel ministry team, we're praying.  I recognized one of the main rabbis of Jerusalem, Harav David Levi, Rabbi David Levi.  I introduced myself and asked him, Are you Rabbi David Levi?  He said, Yes.  I then asked the rabbi, May I ask you a question?  He said, Yes.  In the word of God, Who is the one that delivered?  Who is the one that said, Into your hands I commit my spirit?  Rabbi David looked at me and said, That is not a Jewish concept.  Are you a Christian?  I told the rabbi my background and told him that not only am I Jewish, but I'm a completed Jew, an eternal Jew.  And that Bible verse is Jewish.  I then turned the Bible to the book of Tehillim Psalms, chapter 31, verse 5, and read together with the rabbi.  Into your hands, I commit my spirit.  Deliver me, Lord, my faithful God.  Rabbi David was in complete shock.  He was looking at the Bible verse over and over again.  He was holding his beard.  He couldn't believe his own eyes.  At that moment, something supernatural happened.  He told me, I've read the book of Psalms over a thousand times.  I've never noticed that Bible verse.  I told the rabbi, it's important that we read the Bible in the correct context and not read rabbinic interpretations.  You're a rabbi.  You have authority according to what you teach your students to read the Bible.  Don't allow yourself to be blind by other books.  The rabbi then became defensive and told me, but you can't be speaking about him referring to Yeshua, Jesus.  That's what he meant.  I asked the rabbi, did I talk to you about Yeshua?  He said, no.  I said, then why are you mentioning Yeshua?  Because you know that this Bible verse is speaking about Yeshua.  The rabbi then said, it is impossible, impossible.  It was time for the full gospel.  I then turned the Bible to Isaiah chapter 53 and read the whole chapter.  together with the rabbi in hebrew when we read together isaiah 53 verse 5 the rabbi turned red.  he was pierced for our transgressions.  he was crushed for our iniquities.  the punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we are healed.  This is speaking about Yeshua, Jesus, God, who died on the cross on the tree for our sins, rose on the third day, and by his blood, if we repent and believe, we have full redemption of sins and eternal life.  Psalms 31, verse 5.  Into your hands I commit my spirit.  Deliver me, Lord, my faithful God.  This is what Yeshua, Jesus, did for us.  so you and I can have forgiveness of sins and eternal life.  The fact is that you're the one who said it was Yeshua before I did because you know the truth.  Today is your day of salvation.  Today is the time where God is asking you the question.  The rabbi wanted to leave, but he couldn't move.  I then turned the Bible to Proverbs 30, verse 4, and read together with him.  who has gone up to heaven and come down whose hands have gathered up the wind who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak who has established all the ends of the earth?  what is his name and what is the name of his son?  surely you know?  And I turned to Rabbi David and asked him, surely you know God is speaking to you today.  I gave the rabbi my card with all the information.  We pray that he'll come to know that Yeshua, Jesus, is God and call on him as his personal savior.  The rabbi left the Kotel area fast.  He was shaken up.  Praise Yeshua.  We continue to share all through the Kotel area, Psalms 31, verse 5.  Many heard the gospel.  Many contacts were made.  And many were shaken by the truth.  We will continue to share the gospel all through the land of Israel.  Until all Israel shall be saved.  Romans 11, 26. and we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62 1.  For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not remain quiet, till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And in Hebrew the word for salvation is Yeshua, Jesus.  So it reads like this in Hebrew, for Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  We know that he's coming back.  Revelation 5, 5, as the line of the tribe of Judah.  Revelation 19, verse 12, his eyes are like blazing fire and on his head are many crowns.  And he's coming back to take everything that the enemy has stolen.  And until that time, we will continue to preach the good news of Yeshua everywhere.  Let's continue to stand together for all those that heard the gospel, for Rabbi David, and for the salvation of Israel and the nations.  as we continue to work the harvest together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Ah Yeh Yehudah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, Amen.
