You don't believe me?  Well, good thing we're taking a field trip.  Before we get into why this habitat is so special, there are two important questions to ask.  Number one, what is a habitat anyway?  And number two, where is my guide?  We'll break down question one while I go solve question two. ",

Some habitat types might be easy to spot, like a beach, which is technically the zone extending from the water's edge to the limit of the highest storm waves, or dunes, which stabilize and resupply beachfronts with sand while supporting our diversity of plants and wildlife all their own.  But the Great Lakes region is vast, and there are hundreds of different coastal habitat types that are less known but just as important.  One of those can be found in the Metzger Marsh Wildlife Area just east of Toledo, Ohio.  I met with Matt Kovach there.  He is a coastal program manager for the Nature Conservancy.  He works as part of a team restoring wetlands on the edge of Lake Erie.  And that means he knows this habitat as well as anyone. ",

We've lost about 95% of our wetlands in the state of Ohio.  They provide really, really important wildlife habitat.  for fish and birds and mammals and all sorts of things.  You know, there's a lot of food there.  There's a lot of habitat, a lot of homes for different types of animals that live out here.  A lot of things that migrate, a lot of birds that migrate from south to north and north to south. ",

And these are some of those habitats I told you about, those really important coastal wetland habitats in the Great Lakes.  So this is one of our really common wetland plants up here.  It's called either American water lotus or yellow lotus.  It's got a bunch of common names.  And it's just it's.  it grows really well and you know about three foot of water and we find it kind of fringing in a lot of those between the shallower areas of a lot of our marshes and the deeper areas that are kind of dominated by that some of those submerged aquatic plants that we'd seen earlier.  So this is a muskrat hut.  This is one of the mammals that likes to live out in these areas.  And what they do is they build their homes like this, build these mounds up and they'll have a little compartment inside of there that they'll use as their living room and they'll stay in there all winter long.

They'll use that combined with mud that they pull up from the bottom to basically build this whole structure.  and if you could if we could see inside of it you'll see that it's it's kind of hollowed out.  there's a big open area inside of there and there's actually an entrance right here on that side that they'll use to uh to go inside.
