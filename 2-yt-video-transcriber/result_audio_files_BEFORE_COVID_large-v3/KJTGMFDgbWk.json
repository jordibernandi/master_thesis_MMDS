And let's say the observations of things exposed directly to space at night being cooler is accurate.  Well, that's not exactly a far-fetched idea, but not because the moon is a space fridge or some other dumb nonsense.  It's because, well, let's talk about cloud cover.  If you have a hot, clear, sunny day and then during the night there is cloud cover, the temperature outside will stay relatively warm.  So if clouds can keep heat in, then it's not exactly a stretch to think that the cover provided by trees or what have you could have a similar, if obviously a lot more localised, effect.
