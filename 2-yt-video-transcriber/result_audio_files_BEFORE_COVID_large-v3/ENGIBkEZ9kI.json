Aside from all the other problems I've been having with him that I just haven't voiced because it's not really the topic of my channel, here's issue number one.  Religion isn't sacred.  When you treat religion, which is a set of ideas, ideologies, and practices, as something that's sacred, you lose the all-important ability to criticize it.  If we really treated religion as sacred, then we wouldn't have any means to tell Jehovah's Witnesses not to let their children die if they need blood transfusions.  We wouldn't have any ability to speak out against Zionism, Islamic extremism, or Christian fundamentalism.  All of these ideologies that have tons of actual negative effects associated with them would be beyond the scope of criticism.  But let's continue. ",

He's done some pretty extensive coverage over the situation where Onision's concerned, so if you want to know what's going on there, his channel's probably a good place to look.  Anywho, let's go ahead and go over why.  this statement is absurd.  And we can do that by laying out a few situations where an apology to the victim might be necessary, but a prayer to a god is used in substitution.  Let's say you're an abusive husband, and you punch your wife.  Regardless of the circumstances behind it, what should happen here is communication between you and your wife.  Obviously there's been some breakdown here, and something extreme has happened as a result.  But if we were to apply Onision's logic to this situation, then the husband doesn't owe the wife any apology, or even any communication at that point.  The only person he's accountable to is whoever he has faith in, his god.  Or another scenario, let's say you steal something from your mother's purse.  That's not okay, but then you ask your god for forgiveness.  By Onision's logic, that's as far as this needs to go.  You shouldn't have to apologize to your mother at all.  Now, I'm not gonna say that he's taking this turn because he's himself done several unscrupulous actions, and instead of apologizing to his victims, he would rather just apologize to a god, but I am saying that maybe the timing is a little awkward on this.

It's not me attempting to misrepresent the video, it's that the video itself seems to be this weird blend of actual points and then parody that seems to undermine the points.  Usually I try to respond to the entirety of a video that I'm going after, but this is a bit of a weird case.  If you want to find the original video, it's pretty easy to do so on YouTube, Onision's.  not exactly anyone new, but this is going to be one of the few times that I'm not going to be providing a link in the description, mainly because I just have some ethical issues with directing people over to Onision's channel.  Anyways, as for reasons why someone would want to invent faith, there are several.  The first and most obvious reason would be that there was actually a deity.  We can grant that that was one possible reason.  Other possible reasons includes creating deities to explain phenomenon around the world that we cannot yet explain.  In either case, this is separate from the issue of religion, where a religion can form around the deity as a form of totalitarian control.  People seem to get the idea of religion and belief completely mixed up all the time, so I'm hoping that I can try to make sure that distinction is very well known.  Now, it could also be said that somebody could want to create a deity in order to create a religion around them in order to get that level of control.  So that is an option as well.  What I'm trying to say is there are more answers than obviously God. ",

            "text": "Oh boy, now we got a huge problem here.  You've got a still here in your video that I want to go over.  Ignoring the things that you've just said, considering that those are much less interesting than the points brought up in this fucking slide, why would we naturally invent a higher power all over Earth repeatedly through our own instincts if there was never a higher power?  This is a result of using a very flimsy definition of we.  All it takes is one authority figure whom you trust to tell you that there is a god, or literally any other creature, and you will believe them nine times out of ten, especially if you're a child.  When you phrase the question with a very loose we, as it is in the slide, it seems like it's a knockout.  The problem, though, is that it's a very malformed question.  If your parents believe in a god because their parents believed in a god because their parents believed in a god, and your family is ever growing all the way back until the beginning of your tribe, then it is very likely that you too will probably carry on this belief as well.  As for the next thing on your slide, it says, what if we're all really worshipping the universe itself?  You seem to be talking about something called pantheism.  The thing is, though, is that you're not actually worshipping the universe at that point.  When you worship, there has to be an object that you are worshipping.  I'm using object very loosely, as it can mean a person, deity, or anything in my definition here.  If the object of your worship is Yahweh, you are worshipping Yahweh.  That's it.  You are not, by some weird extension, worshipping the universe, because in the mythology of Christianity, Yahweh is the creator of the universe and is therefore separate from it.  Same goes for Allah and other similar deities.  The worshipping of the universe is a completely separate concept, and the deified universe is something like Spinoza's god or pantheism.  As for the next thing on your slide, what if the universe is God?  Wouldn't you be ridiculous for not also admitting who the undeniable creator of all of us is?  Well, I'm sure you'd have some very interesting conversations with solipsists, since the idea that the universe even exists is something questionable within that epistemology.  But if you're wanting to define the universe as God, then you're using a different definition than a Christian is.  You're using a different definition than a Muslim is.  and then attempting to use your definition of God to say that atheists who are not using your definition of God are silly.  If your definition of God is an anthropomorphized, deified intelligence, the universe doesn't exactly fit that description.  And so I would accuse you of equivocating if you were to tell your interlocutor that they were being stupid.  Your final point in the slide is saying that you basically have to be a fool to not believe in the possibility of this being true, as it is literally impossible to prove wrong at this time.  And while it is true that it's impossible to prove or disprove God, what you're arguing for then is agnosticism, because your position would logically have to include both the proposition and the negation of the proposition.  Since you're saying the negation of the proposition is silly, because the proposition is not as provable, but the proposition is also not provable, then your logic would have to be consistent.  And the proposition itself would also be silly.  This would leave only agnosticism.  Note, I'm specifically using Thomas Huxley's definition of agnosticism.  That's to prevent myself from getting any hyphenators in my comment section yelling about how I miss using Thomas Huxley's own term.  Anyway, it's sad that a still image in your video was the only interesting part I've come across so far, but let's continue. ",

One of the ways to go about this is that when somebody says that science invalidates God, or the other way around, you're committing category errors, if you're willing to accept that God is in the category of supernatural and science deals with the category of the natural.  However, where our disagreement lies is when people try to use God to invalidate science.  This is something that creationism does.  Where applying God to any calculation through the lens of creationism completely invalidates the scientific method.  because God as a proposition is unfalsifiable and therefore should not be in the category of science.  Because any hypothesis or proposition that you make within the scientific method must be falsifiable.  There's gotta be a null proposition.  There has to be some instance in which it would be wrong.  And then we determine whether or not the hypothesis is true.  if the thing that would invalidate it never can happen.  This is why God is unfalsifiable.  There's no way to prove it, but there's no way to disprove it.  It's also why God can't apply to science and science can't apply to God.  These two categories are incongruent.

Thus, they are local atheists.  Or, all gods that have been conceived by man do not exist.  Thus, they are atheists.  You seem to be talking about global atheism, which is the idea that all gods, all possibilities of God, conceived or otherwise, do not exist.
