            "text": "Good afternoon, everybody.  This is Steve Fletcher with the Trumpet for My People.  Today is April 9th, 2019, and I want to share a few details with you about the Donald Trump peace plan deal of the century that is going to be presented on May 15th.  And I want to share some biblical confirmations that this peace deal on May 15th is most likely The seven-day warning that God gave to Noah before the beginning of the great flood.  There is an amazing conjunction of signs and details that go together with this.  And I want to present in a very simple way a beginning marker for you to see this and for you to study more about this.  The fact that this is really bringing us down to a final warning before God brings worldwide judgment.  The peace deal of the century is going to be presented on May 15th.  This is the same exact day as Israel is celebrating their 71st anniversary.  So this is the end of the 70th year.  The number 70 being the most important number in the Bible as far as the judgment of God coming at the end of the 70 years.  So we are brought to May 15th, Peace Deal of the Century Day.  And the important piece of information that goes together with this peace deal is that this is going to be bringing forth the actual dividing of Jerusalem.  To be able to bring peace to the Arab nations and to the Middle East, there have to be concessions made on part of Israel.  And so this peace plan will reportedly include establishment of a Palestinian state of 90% of Judea and Samaria with part of eastern Jerusalem as its capital.  Will the deal of the Century Peace Plan of the Trump administration demand far-reaching concessions from Israel?  Hadashot 13 reported that the peace plan formulated by the White House, and which President Trump is interested in presenting in the coming months, includes the establishment of a Palestinian state in about 90% of Judea and Samaria, with at least part of eastern Jerusalem as its capital.  The report, which was quoted from an American source, said that the Americans would demand that isolated settlements outside the blocs not be expanded and outposts considered illegal by Israeli law be evacuated.  The source claimed that the Palestinian state would be built on more than twice the total area of areas A and B under the control of the Palestinian Authority today.  He added that Trump would seek to divide Jerusalem from a sovereign perspective into two capitals, Israel's in the west of the city and parts of eastern Jerusalem, and the Palestinian one in the Arab neighborhoods of eastern Jerusalem.  Under the plan, the Temple Mount, the Western Wall, and the Mount of Olives would reportedly remain under sovereign control.  under Israeli sovereignty, but with full administrative partnership with the Palestinians.  In Zechariah chapter 12, it talks about the division of Jerusalem.  Zechariah 12, starting in verse 1, The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel saith the Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.  behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem.  and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people.  all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.  So we see that when they come together against Jerusalem, to divide Jerusalem, everybody wanting a piece of Jerusalem, in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone.  In the same chapter, Zechariah 12, starting in verse 9, it goes on to say, It shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy... all the nations that come against Jerusalem.  And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the house and the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications.  And they shall look upon me whom they may have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.  In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of of Hadadrimon in the Valley of Megiddon.  And this goes on to say that the lead up to the battle in the Valley of Megiddon, Armageddon, the Battle of Armageddon, is brought on, this is invoking Armageddon here, and so this is a lead up to Armageddon, which is during the Great Tribulation, the Great Battle of Armageddon.  So this is a lead up to that, the division of Jerusalem, everybody coming against Jerusalem, wanting to take a part of Jerusalem.  It also says in 1 Thessalonians 5, 3 and 4, it says, When they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.  But ye brethren are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.  So it's talking about the peace and safety that is going to be coming before the sudden destruction.  So there's a time when peace and safety will be said.  And this peace and safety, supposedly they're bringing forth a plan to bring peace and safety to Jerusalem.  But in God's. ",
