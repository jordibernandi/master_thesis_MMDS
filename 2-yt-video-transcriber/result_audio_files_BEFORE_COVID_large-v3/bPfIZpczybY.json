            "text": "Cindy Jacobs mentions the bloodiest part of the Philippines, and she refers to Islamic battles there, which is indeed in South Mindanao.  But little does she know, she is striking another nerve as the very name devout.  is Hebrew, and it is the bloodiest part indeed.  For Devao is a word just like Havila, which means childbirth, Eve or Hava's curse.  Devao means menstruation.  Another curse of Eve, Hava.  A tie to ancient Tevila.  A tie to Eve, Hava.  And it is the bloodiest part from which the Philippines will be cleansed indeed.  That is what this female cycle is.  It's a cleansing.  It is a beautiful thing.  Right next to Deval, in fact, we have Samal Island, which is a direct Hebrew word letter for letter, meaning sergeant, but also symbol, emblem, or another way of putting it, a sign for all, the sign of a nation.  Revival is already beginning in Deval, and we saw this in our conference here.  With almost 6,000 in attendance, it is afoot.  However, when his people renew covenant with him, which we are seeing here.  know that there will be judgment in the land for those who refuse to worship Him.  His land will be cleansed.  Today is a perfect example of this.  The earthquakes on All Saints Day?  What is that anyway?  Did you know that the Book of Jubilees records All Saints Day?  Yep, it's right there.  And its practices.  But not in a good way.  Watch this.  Jubilees 22, And do thou, my son Jacob, remember my words, and observe the commandments of Abraham my father.  Separate thyself from the nations, and eat not with them, and do not according to their works, and become not their associate.  For their works are unclean, and all their ways are a pollution, and an abomination, and uncleanness.  They offer their sacrifices to the dead, and they worship evil spirits, and they eat over the graves.  Oops.  And all their works are vanity and nothingness.  This, my friends, is All Saints Day, rebuked by Abraham in Scripture.  They have no heart to understand, and their eyes do not see what their works are.  Do your eyes see?  And how they err in saying to a piece of wood, Thou art my God, and to a stone, Thou art my Lord, and Thou art my Deliverer.  And they have no heart.  And as for thee, my son Jacob, may the Most High God help thee, and the God of heaven bless thee, and remove thee from their uncleanness and from all their error.  He will remove you.  If you will serve him, he will remove you from their error.  Do not follow their ways, my friends.  Be thouware, my son Jacob, of taking a wife from any seed of the daughters of Canaan, for all his seed is to be rooted out of the earth.  For owing to the transgression of Ham, Canaan erred, and all his seed shall be destroyed from off the earth, and all the residue  thereof.\".  and none springing from him shall be saved on the day of judgment.  Understand, the practices being described in this scripture are the ways of Canaan.  And as for all the worshipers of idols and the profane, there shall be no hope for them in the land of the living, and there shall be no remembrance of them on the earth.  For they shall descend into Sheol, and into the place of condemnation shall they go.  As the children of Sodom were taken away from the earth, so will all those who worship idols be taken away.  This rebuke could not be stronger.  There is no way to disobey the second commandment and not suffer its curse.  Fear not, my son Jacob, and be not dismayed, O son of Abraham.  May the Most High God preserve thee from destruction, and from all the paths of error.  may he deliver thee.  See, Jacob was dealing with the same practices we are seeing today.  Because Catholicism is nothing new under the sun.  It is the same old pagan practices of Canaan.  And that is what you're seeing on this very day, All Saints Day, indeed.  This house have I built for myself, that I might put my name upon it in the earth.  It is given to thee and to thy seed forever, and it will be named the house of Abraham.  See, that is not a country, it is a people.  It is given to thee and to thy seed forever.  Jacob's seed migrated into Assyria and then into the Philippines and the southern kingdom eventually into central Africa.  We cover that in our Lost Tribes series in full.  For thou wilt build my house and establish my name before God, Yahuwah, forever.  Thy seed and thy name will stand throughout all generations of the earth.  And then in Ezekiel 39. and I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the aisles, and they shall know that I am Yahuwah.  So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not let them pollute my holy name  anymore.\".  And the heathen shall know that I am Yahuwah, the Holy One in Israel.  His name will be restored in our day.  It will be restored in the Philippines as well as his ways.  But in that restoration will come judgment.  And understand that, my friends, All Saints Day is not a holy day.  It is a satanic day rebuked by Abraham himself.  as the practice of Canaan the evil.  humble themselves and pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, and I will keep promises.  I will hear from heaven, and I will heal your land.  It's time to heal this land. ",
