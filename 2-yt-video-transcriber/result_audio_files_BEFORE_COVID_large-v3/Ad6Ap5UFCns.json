            "text": "So, right now, why are we talking about Tulsi Gabbard?  Well, even though she's not going to attend the sixth Democratic debate stage on December 19th, mind you, I... Again, it's December 11th right now.  Tomorrow will be the 12th at midnight is the last day where she could qualify.  But, again, she has stated that she's not going to attend even if she does qualify.  But that window is closing, and it looks like it's not going to happen.  But that's not the end for Tulsi Gabbard because Axios did a data analysis in regards to, which the presidential candidates are being talked the most online, or who has a large social media interaction.  And turns out, Tulsi Gabbard, both on Facebook and on Twitter, is number one against all the other candidates.  Tulsi Gabbard generated an average of 858 social media interactions for each news story.  Biden averaged 852.  Bernie Sanders gathered 763.  And Warren came in fourth with 648.  So, again, these are probably candidates that are being talked about the most.  I mean, obviously, Biden, Sanders, and Warren are going to be talked about because they got name recognition and, you know, pretty stable campaigns.  I mean, granted, with Biden, let's be real, super PACs are backing him up, and apparently that campaign is in a complete mess.  But with Tulsi Gabbard, though, what I find interesting is that the reason why she's getting a lot of attention is because she's been making her presence seen on a lot of social media outlets, like Joe Rogan, Jimmy Dore, Nico House.  She's been interviewed by a lot of different independent media journalists.  And she's the one who took down, effectively, Kamala Harris and has made a real name for herself for the last debates, and it's been going viral for quite some time.  Let's not forget, after the first two debates, She was the most searched candidate through the Google search engine.  Not to mention she's, again, I have to say it again, she's stood up to Hillary Clinton by calling her the queen of warmongers.  And she's been making her voice heard, especially in regards to talking about how the Democratic National Committee is... pretty much rigging this presidential race and are favoring certain polls over others.  Because mind you, there were two polls earlier this month where she did qualify above 4% to make it to the debate stage, but yet the DNC was saying that the poll from the Boston Globe doesn't count, and then the YouGov poll from South Carolina where she got 5%, I believe maybe 6% of that poll.  It didn't count either.  But yet she's bringing this to everyone's attention because it's like, okay, why is the DNC choosing which polls will be acknowledged and which will not be acknowledged?  And obviously corporate media has been smearing her and people have been calling out corporate media due to the fact that, look, Tulsi Gabbard is not a Russian asset.  She's not an Assad apologist.  And she's not running third party.  I mean, but yet every time people got to remind the media how to do their job. ",

They expect that they say something and people fall through.  I mean, Fox News literally decided that George Bush was president.  So they're doing what historically they've been able to do.  They said Howard Dean shouldn't be in the race, so he screamed, okay, he's not in the race anymore.

I mean, her presence online, she has a large amount of followers, and the very fact that she outlasted Kamala Harris, who, mind you, at one point was considered to be the eventual... front-runner or to go all the way up to the very end of the DNC convention, Tulsi Gabbard has superseded Kamala Harris, who had a lot more resources and accessibility to the establishment.  So Tulsi Gabbard is here to stay.  I think she has a large presence where, you know, she's not going anywhere.  And effectively, she's made her name recognized throughout a lot of American households, whether you like her or not, whether you're a supporter or not.  She's not going anywhere, and she's effectively come off on top against the media, against the DNC, and everything that they have tried to throw at her is not sticking.  And, in fact, she's able to throw it right back at the DNC and the corporate media.  So Tulsi Gabbard, no matter how this election turns out, won. ",

A lot of my libertarian friends are very supportive of Tulsi Gabbard, and so it's no surprise to me when I see a story like, well it was actually, it was a little bit of a surprise to me, when I saw a story about her having more social media hits than all of the front runners.  So that was really surprising.  And at the same time, it's not surprising that she's getting a lot of attention because she's the only anti-war voice.  I mean, I think that's huge.

You know, if that place goes up in flames, a lot of people are going to be affected by a war if that happens in that area.  Tulsi Gabbard is the one who called out the clear coup attempts that were happening in Venezuela and Bolivia.  I mean, right next to Bernie Sanders, too.  But I mean.

There's no one that has the backbone and is willing to take huge political risks the way Tulsi is at very upfront costs themselves.  She was on track to be a huge player within the Democratic Party.  If she had not left the DNC \u2013 she was second in command very quickly \u2013 she could have easily been \u2013 in 20 years a Speaker of the House within that system.  I think that's completely possible.  But no, she said, I don't like the way this is going, and it's more important to me that we deal with foreign policy this way.  I'm going to leave and go to Bernie Sanders.  And she was on every single shit list that Hillary Clinton could possibly shake a pen at right away.  She has... She has willingly taken on enormous amounts of risk to do what she thinks is right.  And that's not even something Bernie Sanders seems to be willing to do.  So if nothing else, you're saying, where does Tulsi Gabbard go from here?  Well, she's not running for re-election.  I think she is confident and she's taking a risk, which is in her wheelhouse, which is her forte, to believe that someone, either she will win or someone that she's allied with will win and she can join them.
