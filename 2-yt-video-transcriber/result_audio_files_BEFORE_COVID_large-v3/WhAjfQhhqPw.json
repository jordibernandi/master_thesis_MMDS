            "text": "alright everyone.  so i think today we need to reconsider the popular understanding of the term alpha male by much of society and of course the way it's misused and abused by the so-called red pill community.  to many of these folks at least in layman terms alpha male means guy who gets a lot of women.  this understanding completely ignores many of the other characteristics that would apply to an alpha male like a wolf pack or even amongst humans leadership certain particular forms of charisma Ability to make sound judgments.  No, it's just about attracting women.  There are some problems with that because some guys don't have any of those traits but might just be, let's say, working in an industry with a lot of women so they attract many of them.  Or you take Shawn Mendes, one of the most beta supplicating guys in the music industry.  Songs are always about trying to chase after some unattainable woman who ignores him.  But he would, based upon his star power, get better quality women than your average alpha male.  protein fart in the gym.  I mean, look at some of his song lyrics.  I'll stop time for you.  Sit on any dildo you want me to.  Automatic alpha male.  But it's ridiculous, right?  Now you say, well that's just because of his music, otherwise he's a beta, you can't really use that as an example, because these other guys are more alpha.  Okay, so let's consider it.  Take my good friend, Pitt Brady, the actor.  In 2005, he's at the top of his game.  Extraordinarily good looking, he's got a lot of sex appeal, he's been in a lot of popular, well-known films, and definitely the apple of the eye of a lot of women.  So his hypergamy kicks in, he trades up from Jennifer Aniston, pretty good looking, to Angelina Jolie, very good looking at the time, A-list actress quality.  You say, alpha male Brad Pitt.  Okay, here's the problem though.  Before she was with Brad Pitt, and these are just the ones we know about, Angelina Jolie was together with this guy Johnny Lee Miller, a relatively unknown actor from, I think, the UK.  And then she was with Billy Bob Corndog.  And Billy Bob Corndog, yes, he's had a successful career, but he's not comparable to Brad Pitt.  He's older, he's got that kind of, um, punk ass, heavy metal, budget moving skinhead or white power.  look to him.  He's not exactly Brad Pitt.  Successful actor, very talented, but not on the same level.  He gets Angelina Jolie before Brad Pitt does.  And of course we're assuming those are the only guys she was ever with.  So here's this top of the line alpha male getting a woman who's been used by dudes who are arguably less attractive and less successful than he is.  but now we're saying he's alpha male.  This is a little bit of a warped understanding.  You see, if you go back to like the Middle Ages, you might have a king who could go through the village, I want the village wenches, this, that, and the other, and you couldn't do much unless you could hide away your daughter.  So you could get pretty much cream of the crop, the virgins, whatnot.  These guys aren't really able to do that.  They're going after basically the bottom of the barrel.  I mean, they might be good-looking women, but they've still been with tons of men.  They've gotten TSA checked, their baggage, you know, maybe ten twenty fifty times but well they're good looking.  therefore it's an alpha male.  it's a little bit of a misconception i think.  take another guy tom brady.  the brady battles.  tom brady immensely successful head of a football team led to victory multiple occasions.  he's not ugly at all very physically fit.  oh he's with a supermodel.  he's with a supermodel but look at how many guys she was with prior to him.  i mean in this a lot of dudes some of them maybe equally prominent others less so.  so is tom brady an alpha or a beta male?  you know he has.  she's been with wrote through all these guys.  and how?  if you put them up next to dicaprio forgetting about the fact that the copper is an actor and let's say brady's just brady without being a football star you would think that brady is the alpha male.  dicaprio's this little shrimp on the barbie.  you know a nerd But DiCaprio got her first.  And DiCaprio is known for pumping and dumping women.  So again, we have to ask, at what point do you start defining alpha male by more than simply success with women?  It seems like a limited understanding.  And hey, let's take another example going back in time.  Napoleon Bonaparte.  dude was renowned feared by commoners in other countries who otherwise would probably only know their own king and he goes from being relatively nothing on an island to leading the french empire.  so definitely not a guy you can accuse of being you know not accomplished or weak or not courageous.  he married the mistress of his superior officer in the military And when he was trying to campaign through Egypt, he got cucked by her.  This is Napoleon.  Now we could call Napoleon a beta male, but it's like, where does it all play out?  Napoleon's more of an alpha male in terms of the sum of his accomplishments than most of these actors, but certainly most of these people who in the current age describe themselves as alpha male on the basis of getting women.  You see, we need to be able to differentiate between a guy who all around embodies what it means to be an alpha male and a guy who's just good with women.  It's not necessarily the same thing.  Women will respond to certain traits, abilities, to physical appearance in some cases, but there's exceptions to that.  That's why these skinny, kind of whiny dudes who complain about in the song, treat you better, they get women oftentimes better than the dudes who embody those traditional traits you know kinda basic beauty alpha male traits that are thrown around which you gotta be six feet and strong and not give a damn like okay.  so my point is that it's a bit of a warped understanding and I think people should stop throwing it around so much.  I get the fact that there's a lot of fragile egos on the Internet particularly when it comes to the subject love male and female relationships.  but it's not particularly accurate when you're sick.  suppose a definition of alpha male cannot stick if you apply it across reality.  And that's what we need to consider.  So in the heart of your pumped up, amped up, pre-workout heart, you know that I'm right. ",
