            "text": "So I'm here with William Rodriguez, and you were a janitor in the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, and you were involved in saving many lives.  Can you tell us about that, show us the key?  Alex, I worked in the building for 20 years, and 9-11 was a definite moment in my life because it changed me forever.  I came into work late.  I was supposed to be there at 8 o'clock.  I got there at 8.30.  I went straight down to the basement.  There were six up levels of basement.  Our office was located on the B1 level, the basement number one.  While I was there talking to my supervisor, 14 new employees.  at 846 we hear BAM!  an explosion so powerful that pushes up all the walls cracked the full ceiling fell on top of us the sprinkler system got activated water started going everywhere.  everybody's screaming because there's a disorientation because nobody knew what was happening.  and at the very first moment that i i i hear that i thought that one of the generators flew out on the v2 level because it pushes up.  And when I went to mention it, six, seven seconds after, I hear, BAM, on the top of the building, two different events.  And I went to tell everybody, you know, we've got to get out of here.  My supervisor, Anthony Saltalamaca, said, it's a bomb, it's a bomb, it's a bomb, because we didn't have windows.  We're on a basement.  And nobody knew what to do.  At that same moment, I looked through the hallway that went directly to the office, and what do I see?  A man, a black guy with his hand extended, screaming, explosion, explosion, explosion.  And his hand had what appears to be clothing hanging from the top of the fingertips.  As he got closer, we started screaming and crying because we realized it was his skin.  He got his skin pulled from under his armpits, on both arms, and he peeled off like when you take off a glove, and it was hanging on top of the finger.  And at that very moment, they said, what happened?  And he turned his face, and all this was hanging on his face.  The name Felipe David was his name, a guy from Honduras, which I didn't know.  Nobody wanted to touch him because this was in 2001.  Remember that in 2001, we had that ace gear that no touching anybody with blood because you didn't know what to happen.  And when I saw that, I started screaming, help me, help me.  Nobody wanted to help.  So I went into the office, and I took a box of rags, because it was a cleaning company, and I started putting it around him.  I said, don't move.  I'm going to call the medical emergency unit that is located on the other tower, because they connect it to the basement.  And I said, I'm going to call them, and you're going to get help right away.  When I went inside to touch the phone, another explosion.  And it was so powerful that the floor started to vibrate and everybody run inside the offices under the door thinking that it was an earthquake.  And at that very moment I said, no, we've got to get out of here.  We've got to get out of here.  And nobody wanted to touch the poor man.  So I took the poor man, I put it on my shoulder, and I started leaving the area because I knew the way to get out because I worked in the building for 20 years.  And these were new employees.  So I started leaving these people out of the building.  When we get outside, on Vesey Street, I see an ambulance, I stop the ambulance, I put the man inside the ambulance, and what do I hear?  Everybody screaming on the street, looking up with their mouth open.  So I turn around, And I hear a plane hit the building, a plane hit the building on the radio of the security guard that let trucks go inside the building.  So I turn around, what do I see?  I saw the hole, I saw the fire, I saw the smoke, but the smoke was so dense that it covered the top of the antenna of the North Tower.  When I don't see the top of the antenna, I start screaming, we've got to go back, we've got to go back.  Nobody wanted to go back because they already saved themselves.  And my supervisor said, no, we've got to stay here.  I said, no, we've got to go back.  Our friends are there.  And I met the people from Windows of the World, the restaurant that was located on the 106th and the 107th floor.  And I said, we've got to go back, we've got to help them.  and i knew at that very moment that i was basically spared my life because if i got there at eight o'clock i always started from the top of the building working down cleaning the stairwells and i always went to windows of the world because they gave me the breakfast for free.  you know when they give you something for free you're going to be there.  so i was there every morning this day i i was late And I knew that my friends were stuck in there.  So I started screaming, we've got to go back, we've got to go back.  Nobody wanted to go back.  So I went by myself.  I went straight to the South Tower through the basement, through the OCC.  OCC was the operational control center where they actually manage all the emergencies.  It was supposed to be meant 24 hours a day.  When I went there, there was nobody there.  Everybody ran away.  So I'm meeting with the radio, help, help, nobody's there.  I turn around, I see a guy coming from the basement of the South Tower.  The South Tower has not been hit yet.  And the name is Jimmy Barrett.  I said, Jimmy, what are you doing here?  You've got to get out.  He didn't know.  So that gives you an indication how many people probably died on the South Tower without even knowing what was going on.  And I said, you've got to get out.  I told him what happened.  And when I turned around, between the two towers, there was an employee entrance.  for the Marriott Hotel.  And there was a security guard that signed the people in.  This lady is trembling, shaking.  I said, what are you doing here?  You got to get out.  And she said, I heard everything, but I cannot leave.  I said, why?  Because I am a new employee, and I don't want to get fired.  false sense of security, no?  Because we didn't know what was happening.  So I took her, and I grabbed her, and I took her outside the building through the basement with Jimmy, and then I went back running.  Everybody, don't go back, don't go back.  We went to the North Tower, and on the North Tower, Jimmy was with me.  We found a guy from the recycling company who said, I hear screams, I hear screams.  What we heard was the sprinkler system.  It was activated everywhere.  All you could hear was So I said, I don't hear anything.  So I put my ear in one of the brake elevators.  And what do I hear?  Two people screaming, help, help, we're going to drown, we're going to drown.  And I just like, who wants to drown?  Why would they drown?  They were inside the elevator, a freight elevator, and the elevator, instead of going up, went down and gasped up between the B2 level and the B3 level.  All the water was going in, and they couldn't come out.  They gasped up because they lost power.  So I found a pipe.  I opened the door.  The door is open this way.  When I opened it, when the door hit the bottom, all the water that was on my side went rushing in.  When I looked down, what do I see?  These two people, because it was afraid, it didn't have a roof.  with water up to their belly, screaming, help, help, help, help.  And at that moment, I say, God, please help me.  And then I look around, and I found a ladder.  And I took the ladder, and I dropped it in, and I went in, opened the gate on the top of the elevator, got them both out.  One name was Salvatore Giambanco, a painter for the Port Authority, and really a guy that went to do a delivery.  Got them out of the building.  Put him in an ambulance and went back the third time.  When I went back the third time, I found a police officer who said, Willie, do you have the key?  He meant, did I have the master key?  The World Trade Center have five master keys.  The first four were held by the administrators of the building who were trained on egress, escape, the whole process of evacuation.  They were the ones trained to help people.  And they ran away.  And I have the fifth key.  I was a janitor.  But I had that key.  And I said, yes, I have the key.  And the police knew that I had that key.  So we went to the lobby.  And the police officer said to the fireman there, he said, follow him.  He knows very well the building.  And he has the master key.  And why was that key so important?  Because that key, when the plane hit, this is the key.  They call it the key of hope.  When the plane hit the building, the building wasn't designed to oscillate because of the wind factor, but it oscillated so much down that the door frames dislocated and the doors got locked.  So with the keys, we would open and force the doors open.  So I started opening doors and letting people out on the offices as well, because it's open everywhere.  And as I do that, the firemen went and did their job as a... as a crew, and we kept going up, up, up, up, up, until the moment that I found myself two and three floors above the firemen letting people out.  And I was so angry because I didn't understand.  I said, why are these people not following me?  I didn't understand that I didn't have any equipment in my bag.  The firemen have between... what, 40 and 60 kilos in their back.  And they're going up.  Plus, they had the uniform and things like that.  And I was so angry.  I didn't understand it.  And I remember that somebody said, there's a man on a wheelchair on the 27th floor who's having an asthma attack.  He cannot breathe.  So I went to the fireman.  And they told me, don't worry.  We'll make it there.  We made it to the 27th floor.  And when I opened the door on the 27th floor, The image was unforgettable.  This unit of heroes, my heroes, the firemen, they all went in and they collapsed on the corridor because they didn't have any more strength.  Nobody's going up 27 floors with all that equipment.  They just collapsed.  And I remember the police officer said, Willie, did you know this office?  They said, yes.  Where can I get water?  He said, well, on the other side, there's the vending machines for the bottled water.  I said, let's go.  I don't have no money.  So we go over there, and the police officer with the boots started breaking the glass.  I was, oh, my God.  He's going to blame me.  I'm the Puerto Rican.  He's going to rape me.  So I got to get out of here.  He said, no, no, please help me.  And we started looking for bottled waters, and we gave it to the police officer, I mean to the pharmacist.  And at that moment, I called my mother because there was still one service in the office.  And then I continued by myself because these people were there, collapsed.  So I continued opening doors until the moment I get to the 33rd floor.  I get to the 33rd floor.  I hear strange sounds on the 34th floor.  Above me, I bypassed that floor.  I didn't want to open the door.  But I continued getting people out of the 39th floor.  When I get to the 39th floor, The police officer with the fire chiefs, because they were wearing white shirts, they said, the whole process of evacuation, what are we going to do?  And then, bam!  We hear another explosion, huge, on the other tower.  could have been the head of the plane.  I have no idea what it was.  And then at that moment, we hear inside our building.  And I said, what happened?  He said, we lost 65.  We lost 65, meaning the 63 floor collapsed internally to the 44 floor.  And I was .  So I go crazy, we gotta go up, we gotta go up.  And the police officer said, no, you've done enough, and you don't get paid for this.  You're my responsibility as a citizen, you gotta get out and leave.  I said, no, no, I'm gonna continue going up.  He said, better if you give me a hand with the man on the wheelchair, on the 27th floor.  So I go to the 27th floor.  I said, I will help, but I don't want to come back.  So I got the man in the wheelchair, named FAA, and we start going down the stairwell.  And as we go down, the other building collapses.  And it creates a whole movement in our building.  We lost our foot on the stair, and we almost fell down the stairwell.  But we made it all the way down to the lobby.  When we made it to the lobby, it was all destruction because the other tower already collapsed.  And I look all the destruction on the lobby, and one of the farmers on the lobby said, get the ambulance ready while they're giving first aid to the poor man that was on the wheelchair.  As they're doing that, I go to the front of the building facing West Side Highway.  And as I go to the revolting doors, there was no doors.  Everything was destroyed.  As I get to the middle one, What do I see?  That the police is across the street.  The area is cordoned out with a yellow tape that says crime scene do not pass.  And they see me and they start screaming, don't look back, don't look back, don't look back.  And the first thing I do is look back.  And I saw all the bodies of the people that jumped out of there.  I didn't know that the people were throwing themselves through the windows.  And I saw bodies everywhere.  And I started screaming, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.  And all of a sudden I hear, run, run, run.  And the building started to shake and it started to fall.  And the only thing in front of me was a fire truck.  I went right under the fire truck.  and the building collapsed right on top of it.  And I was buried alive.  And then it took hours for them to find me.  And then I was saved hours after.  And once I was saved from under the rubble, a miracle because I didn't break a bone.  And I stayed within the ground zero looking for other people.  up to the end of the day.  Your testimony for the 9-11 Commission is not public.  No, no.  I testified for the 9-11 Commission and everybody knew my story because I was taken to the White House, I was wine and dine, I was put on, imagine, every possible documentary.  And when I talk about the explosions in the building, that could have been anything.  Could have been anything, but they did not investigate it.  It created the whole conspiracy theory of the World Trade Center and nothing that I have that I agree with it.  But it created a whole sense of insecurity because when the 9-11 Commission report came out, my testimony was eliminated.  It didn't show anyone.  And that's when people started really questioning the 9-11 report.  The fact that you talked about explosions.  Explosions in the building, yeah.  And then your testimony was omitted.  Omitted, yeah.  Totally omitted, yes.  And of course, you know, the attacks started at that moment.  They started doing the whole propaganda against my story.  And, you know, but this is what I went through.  And I gave the 9-11 Commission a list of witnesses that they were never called.  And... Again, you know, I didn't have any good thing to say about the 9-11 culture because I went through it.  Thank you. ",
