            "text": "Hello!  As you can probably tell by the title of this video, this is something a little bit different today.  A couple of months ago, I went out to sunny, summery London to a park to find out what complete strangers knew about LGBT history.  So this is how it worked.  I showed them this timeline that was from 1960 to 2019, and then I gave them a series of events or laws passing, things that have been important to LGBT history, and got them to pin them on the timeline where they thought it happened.  Once they pinned all the events on the timeline, I then revealed to them what years those things had actually happened.  I've left a list in the description of all of the different events that we talk about.  I thought it'd be kind of interesting, if you wanted to, to copy and paste it into the comments and guess before watching this video all the way through what year each of those events were likely to have taken place.  And then at the end of the video, see how close you were.  Now for disclosure, this is not the kind of talking to people on the street video which is trying to humiliate people or make them look bad about not knowing about things that they should definitely know about.  Although I wish that a lot more people knew about LGBT history, there are even some LGBT people in this video who didn't know a lot of these dates.  These aren't things that we've been taught.  But I'm gonna talk a little bit more about that at the end of the video.  For now, let's see how much they knew. ",

There's quite a few here that, in my optimism, I've sort of put a lot earlier, and there's quite a lot of things that happened... quite recently, which is sort of hard to believe in many ways.  And I think as somebody who, you know, is a young member of the LGBT community, it's strange to think that not that long ago, people who are just slightly older than me were facing so much more stuff and so much, you know, so much more like, like just hardships and things.  and yeah I feel like I've learned a lot through doing this and I also feel like a really bad gay.

I've talked about this in videos before, but what often happens is queer people, when they are coming into their own identity, will start to do their own research on this kind of stuff alone.  And what they'll find is what a lot of people in these videos found, actually the gains that we've had towards equality are much more recent.  When they're researching our history what they're going to come across is a whole lot of tragedy.  I think it's vitally important that this history is talked about in schools, in communal places, in spaces where people can get support if they need it.  In the description I'm going to leave a list of resources and groups that are helping to keep this history alive and I highly recommend you check them out.  If you'd like to help support me make videos like this one, then please consider becoming a patron on Patreon.  I have a load of tiers and different perks that you can get across there.  As always, I'll leave a link to my social media so you can find me all over the internet.  And until I see you next time, bye. ",
