So if anyone thinks that I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry, I'm not going to do it.  But according to a CNN K-file investigation, in his early years, Bernie Sanders felt differently.  Nobody should earn more than a million dollars, Sanders said in a 1974 article.  That's the equivalent of a little more than $5 million today.  And anything above $1 million, he believed, should be 100% taxed.  He said it should be illegal to amass more wealth than a human family could use in a lifetime.  and that members of the Senate should earn the median income of their constituents.  That philosophy on wealth disparity became the bedrock of Sanders' platform, railing against the ties linking economic and political power. ",

By the time his application was denied, he was too old to be drafted.  He was working as a carpenter in Vermont when he attended a meeting of a small left-wing group called the Liberty Union Party.  He emerged as their candidate for U.S.  Senate.  We're in this meeting and we've done all our business and here we don't have anybody for the U.S.  Senate slot.  I turn over and I see this bushy-haired guy in his rumpled clothes and I'm saying, hey, you.  You want to run for this seat?  We need some fresh meat to sacrifice on the altar of the ballot.  I don't think he had any illusions about winning, and I think he certainly surprised me, and I think perhaps surprised himself by volunteering to run for the Senate.  And that was the beginning of his electoral career.  That campaign included some of Sanders' most extreme ideas, including legalizing all drugs, including heroin, and even legalizing hitchhiking, which he often did to get from event to event.  Doris Lake campaigned with Sanders in 1972 as the Liberty Union's congressional candidate. ",

The policies he's held on to since then, like universal health care, free public college, and raising taxes on the wealthy, are largely what appeal to his supporters today.  I have run for office in the state of Vermont on many occasions.  Sometimes I've lost.  More often, I've won.  What all of that showed is that those ideas were not radical ideas.  They were common sense American ideas that the American people supported.  And while much of what Sanders advocated for early on in his career remains the same today, there are some of the more radical positions that he has changed on.  A campaign spokesperson confirming for us tonight that Sanders now believes that compulsory education is a good idea.  He no longer believes that we should lower the voting age to 14.  He no longer supports nationalizing many private industries.  And he no longer supports legalizing all drugs, including heroin.  Wolf?  Good report. ",

            "text": "Ryan Nobles, thanks so much.  I don't know whether I should be annoyed or I should be thanking them, because make no mistake about it, a lot of that stuff that they laid out there is a snide jab at Bernie.  It's an attempt to take him down a couple pegs and act like, pfft, look at some of the crazy things he believed in.  But even though I don't agree with all the stuff that young Bernie said... It's pretty fucking badass, son.  So let's go through it.  First of all, they bring up the criticism.  that wasn't a criticism, they made it up.  Of like, he made a million dollars from selling his book.  How dare he make money when he says he wants to tax the rich?  Yeah.  Please, man.  Nobody on the left actually made the criticism of like, oh, how could he make over a million dollars?  You guys made the criticism.  You made the criticism.  Now we all know he would raise his own taxes.  See, it's that old Russell Brand quote, which is brilliant, of when I was poor and I complained about the wealth inequality, they called me bitter.  Now that I'm rich and I complain about the wealth inequality, they call me a hypocrite.  So Bernie can't win.  He can't win.  His policy position has not changed in terms of he thinks we should tax the rich more, but they still try to do a gotcha on him because he made money from selling a book.  But nobody on the left was actually mad about that.  None of us were mad about that.  None of us.  I haven't seen a single person on the left who was like, oh, how could he?  Now he lost my vote.  So you guys made it up and you're running with it because in your mind you have a caricature, a stereotype of what you think a lefty would get mad about.  And you're projecting and you're like, oh, he's getting criticism.  He's getting criticism from the left because he made a million dollars.  But he's not.  You made it up.  You're the ones criticizing him.  Now let's go through some of his old policy positions.  Back in the day, he said, this was a long time ago, nobody should earn more than $1 million.  So in other words, all income over $1 million should be taxed at 100%.  Now when you adjust for inflation, the amount of money he was talking about in today's dollars is about $5 million.  Now, am I in favor of that policy?  I'm not, no.  But is that a crazy policy?  Like, I always find it hilarious when people try to pearl clutch and act like certain ideas are crazy when they're obviously not crazy.  Do you have any idea how much money $5 million a year is?  Do you have any idea how much money that really is?  I don't think people can really wrap their minds around how much money that is.  $5 million a year.  So even though I don't support a 100% tax on making $5 million a year or more, every dollar over $5 million, that's what he was proposing, I don't think it's a crazy idea at all.  I don't think it's crazy at all.  I think that you would still be phenomenally, amazingly, incredibly wealthy in a way where you probably couldn't spend all that money in a lifetime.  if you're making $5 million a year.  The idea that we're supposed to... Let's say somebody earns, whatever that means, $15 million in our current fucked up system.  $15 million a year.  And they're walking away netting $5 million.  And we're supposed to feel bad for them?  Like pity the poor person who just made $5 million?  No.  The way we think about this stuff is all wrong.  Because you look at... the amount of money that they made in our current system.  And you think that that's an actual reflection organically of like who they are as a person and their worth as a human being.  No, it just reflects their market value.  That's it.  Market value does not equal human value.  That same system that gave one guy $15 million a year is also the same system that decided, you know, a single mother in Cleveland who works two full-time jobs shouldn't make enough money to put food on the table and pay the light bill.  So perhaps the system is fucked up in terms of the distribution.  Perhaps when we have millions and millions and millions of working poor people, people who work full time and still don't make enough money to survive, perhaps the entire system needs to be retooled and switched up.  And we need a living wage as a matter of law.  And we need right to a union as a matter of law.  And we need, you know, a progressive taxation system like every other developed system in the world has.  By the way, I'm not sure what the exact rates are in Scandinavia, but you're in the ballpark if you're saying 100% tax over $5 million.  Again, I don't know the exact rates, but that's not too far off from what it is in the Scandinavian countries.  So, take that for what it's worth.  Again, I don't support the policy, but I don't think it's crazy, and I don't think people listening to it are going to be as outraged as CNN is pretending to be here.  Um... Then he said members of the Senate should earn the median wage of the places they're representing.  That's a pretty badass proposal.  Again, I don't think I support that, particularly because I think when you get rid of money in politics, like you get rid of the corrupting influence and corrosive influence of private money, that I actually am totally fine with paying our senators and congresspeople well.  Pay them very well and ban the private money and make them feel like If you take the private money, you really are selling out and turning your back on your constituents who are paying you really well for what you're doing.  So I'm in favor of paying them really well, but also getting rid of all the private financing of elections and basically banning the revolving door.  so afterwards they can't go and get rich in the private sector by selling out.  So if they can't go out and get rich in the private sector, make it so they get paid well when they're in government, basically.  Okay, I digress.  But that's still a badass idea.  And then legalizing all drugs, super badass.  Legalizing hitchhiking, I didn't even know that was illegal.  A 14-year-old voting age, I don't agree with that one, but I believe in 16-year-old voting age.  I think it should be 16 and up.  Draw a line at 16 for everything.  So 16 and up, that's when you're considered an adult in the eyes of the law in my ideal system.  And non-compulsory... School, I never thought of that before.  I don't think I support that.  It's a little weird, a little too libertarian-ish, if you ask me.  But I'm not outraged by Bernie having supported that at one time.  So I think that the attack actually falls flat because it makes him just look like a super badass.  I mean, in the 1970s, if you're talking about legalizing all drugs, that's so badass.  Yeah.  That's so ahead of the times.  That's so ahead of the times.  So, I hope this increases his support.  And listen, truth be told, as of right this second, he needs it.  Because Joe Biden now, admittedly, all these polls are skewed and they oversample older voters.  But, but, he's leading now in the last four, five, six polls.  And it's by quite a bit.  So, even if you factor in for the fact that the polls are skewed, I think Bernie is still down.  So... I hope mainstream media attacks Bernie and it helps him because some of these attacks, in my opinion, I think they will help him. ",
