            "text": "We're going to be getting into history revision and dock connections shortly.  One of the questions I was asked, probably about a month ago now, is please discuss the subject of intent and does praying help?  Well, intent is a funny word as we know little about implied intent, similar to implied consent also.  When we are consenting either through word magic, ignorance or just plain stupidity by not thinking things through enough.  so now you set your intent for a god or jesus to save you but what if that god or jesus is being played in a role by somebody else?  can you state 100 that it's god or jesus that you are speaking to Now?  the answer is no.  You can only assume or desire that connection.  You cannot 100% guarantee that it's that entity you are interacting with.  So you set your intent of save me or save this.  But if source is listening and zillions of creatures and planets are crying for help, how can and is your case more important?  this is what you've got to consider and the question arises is does your intent only serve your interests or requests or does it involve people or incidents outside of your field?  we are so wrapped up almost tongue-tied with words and interpretations that setting your intent can become a minefield Like last week.  it was suggested that the foundation would not include Christians and I answered that question based on how that narrative was delivered.  Now a reply email was that it didn't come out as they intended.  and there is the problem.  And this is why last week's show was highlighted, our lack of thinking on what we say or write, because it has become a big problem.  So when setting intent, it becomes a big issue.  And it's why I said avoid mass meditations.  Because those taking part in it do not know the real intent by those who are delivering it.  They may say, meditate on this mandala, but do we really know the intention of that mandala?  Most of us don't.  We just assume that it's from India or Tibet and it's all things love and light and peaceful.  It's a wrong assumption.  And we've just accepted that a narrative that is apportioned to it.  Well, they'll say the Dalai Lama endorsed it, and he's from Tibet, so it must be okay.  Except the Dalai Lama is cabal.  Oops.  And this is where we have to be careful with intent.  Many people will set their intent for the RV to happen, and they don't realize it will unleash the genocide program on us all.  Many people set their intent for ETs to come down and save us.  And that would unleash the harvesting program promoted by Ra and the Lord of One.  And so I hope you can now see where the issues can and will arise with intent.  We just don't know enough.  This is the problem.  As for praying, as it's done currently it's throwing out your life force energy to an external vault just waiting to collect your energy.  it's called blue shink.  why not pray internally?  pray to yourself to heal injuries or remove disease in your own vessel or drive you to deal with your shadow and inner work.  Pray for yourself to be a better person than you are currently.  Surely that's a better use of your life force energy than sending it to some unproven being that sits on a clad.  That appears to predict cataclysms and yet does nothing to prevent them.  That's your life force energy.  So praying is inward, not external.  That's lution.  Again, we're naive on our life force energy.  We're naive on our souls or our spirit, where it goes, what it does.  These are things that have to be taught.  and I'm hoping in the future we have extra shows planned with Randy Morgans and Alan from OYM where we will be discussing several topics, teaching being probably the main one and one of the proposals that was put forward is should we consider a mystery school.  But I think that will be important going forward.  We need to find out more of who and what we really are.  Then the subject of intent and praying will really come into focus of how naive we have really been.  It was announced this week that the Democrat Elizabeth Warren is going to be running for the next election.  She better start running now because she'll waste her time.  But I found it rather funny that the initials Democrat Elizabeth Warren spells Jew as in directed energy weapon.  uh weapon being the right term for her me thinks uh the people in the uk will get that more right.  let's have some history review and uh rewriting and then what will follow will be uh a dock connector of where it all fits in margaret sanger and planned parenthood which has all the ingredients of Nazism, eugenics, occultism and psychotic tendencies, with all the usual characters in place.  Jack Parsons, Darwin, Hubbard, Steiner, Blavatsky, Crowley, the Ku Klux Klan, the Democrats, the Catholic Church and feminism.  all rolled into one giant future alt-media investigation program that replaced the previously known conspiracy theorist program.  Now she was born in Ireland an advocate for women's rights but also a strong advocate for birth control which was actually banned in America until her and others worked to overturn it in the late 20s or early 30s.  Now she was arrested at least eight times for expressing their views during an era in which speaking publicly about contraception was deemed illegal.  So much for the free speech on the Constitution back then in the 1920s.  But this woman had serious backing from somewhere.  as nowhere in our records show where her funds came from, and particularly in her early days for traveling globally.  Now, she was based in New York, and she traveled to Holland to overview a birth control clinic back in 1915.  That would have been a high cost.  And then it became clear that Later that funding became available to her and was followed by trips to China, Korea and also Japan in the mid 1920s.  Again, can you imagine the cost of that trip?  Plus she also set up a clinic, which was the first of its kind in 1923.  And the clinic and the three trips to Asia were all heavily funded by the Rockefellers.  there's your first dot connector now riddled with contradictory thinking which was something we covered in last week's show.  as this statement shows Sangha wrote that masturbation was dangerous.  really she stated in my personal experience as a trained nurse while attending persons afflicted with various and often revolting diseases.  No matter what their ailments, I have never found anyone so repulsive as the chronic masturbator.  you. ",
