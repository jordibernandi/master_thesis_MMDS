As I'm recording this interview, gold and silver are correcting hard, as well as general markets, as well as the mining stocks a little bit here.  And with that backdrop, I wanted Brian Lundin, one of the premier precious metals analysts, investors, and newsletter writers to give us his take on what's going on after the incredible rally we've enjoyed.  It's funny, silver is the best performing asset for Q3 and the worst performing asset of September.  So it's been quite volatile for silver and for gold as well.  Brian, thank you for coming on the show again. ",

            "text": "Well, that's interesting.  You know, it's the technical story that has been driving or dragging gold down.  But literally, as we speak, the gold's up about twenty three, twenty four dollars today.  So it just goes to show some of the volatility that we've seen in the middle.  My view has been there's there's two narratives at play and kind of fighting against each other in the gold market.  The short-term narrative, the narrative that took gold down was that we weren't getting any more headline help, that the world was looking a bit rosier for gold, and that gold had failed to advance and was breaking some technical levels that were presaging a further decline.  Key among those was a nearly perfect head and shoulders pattern that gold completed a few sessions or a session or two, rather, before the big sell off that took it well below $1500.  And that head and shoulders pattern pointed to a correction that would be down in the 1400 to 1425 level.  which would be probably healthy for the long-term view of the market, but certainly distressing to investors over the very near term.  The other narrative is the longer, more fundamental monetary argument for gold that we're going to have kind of in spite of or kind of because of the broadening economic slowdown, but more generally, because of the need of the markets around the world to feed their addiction to easy money, that we were going to have a continuation of ever easier central bank monetary policy.  And in fact, probably negative real rates on interest rates for, literally forever because we cannot have interest rates higher than the rate of inflation anymore because of the large debts that we have.  We couldn't afford to service those debts.  So there's a larger, longer-term fundamental narrative at play, and there's a shorter-term, more trader-oriented narrative play where a lot of these short-term traders, trend followers that have gotten into gold suddenly abandoned ship.  as to metals upward momentum kind of waned.  So right now we're in the middle of that.  We had some headline help over the last day or so.  We've had the dollar go down a bit and gold's popped back up.  above $1,500.  Still, there's that technical picture out there that's going to get the short term traders probably jumping in on the short side.  So I don't know where it's going to end up over the next couple of weeks, but longer term, over the next months and years, I think the bullish picture for gold is tremendously powerful and will remain intact.

            "text": "Let's talk about the very long term.  So there's a ratio between the Dow Jones and gold.  It has been called the most important chart in investing.  in the 20th century, or should I say in the last 100 years, it has had six cycles.  So its cycles are very long.  Right now it's been expanding since 2011.  So the Dow is outperforming gold since 2011.  But these moves are about 15 to 20 years long, usually, like I said.  Do you believe that the Dow Jones to gold ratio is peaking?  Because it has come down substantially, meaning that gold has been outperforming the Dow.  Or do you think that there are five to ten more years here that uh the dow will actually outperform gold doesn't mean the goal will go down.  just means that um the dow will outperform it.  so yeah what do you think about?  sorry what do you think about this this whole situation?

            "text": "I think that the days of the Dow significantly outperforming gold are over, but I don't think that necessarily means a very severe steep decline in the Dow.  I think it more speaks to the fact that gold will rise as a counterbalance.  What's really inflated financial assets, and that's everything from equities to real estate prices to even bond prices.  over the last 10 years, and in the case of bonds, 30 years, has been this ever easier monetary policy from central banks so that every economic slowdown is met with the deluge of liquidity from central banks, lowered interest rates, always ratcheting ever lower, and just a flood of money, of liquidity into the market.  So how many of these cycles we're going to have before fiat currencies in general, the dollar in particular, completely lose their credibility.  I don't know, maybe two or three more cycles.  But I do know that we have entered another cycle of monetary easing and we're already so low in interest rates and we already have injected so much liquidity into the markets that the next set, the next reaction is going to be fairly deep into the negative zone on interest rates and levels of quantitative easing that far exceed anything done previously.  So we're entering another one of these cycles that I think is extremely bullish for gold.  Getting back to your point, this monetary easing that has previously inflated equity markets will probably do so again.  this return of easing by central banks will actually be bullish for equities as well.  I do think though that gold will outperform equities in this run and therefore that ratio you're talking about will continue to fall. ",

At the same time, in 1980, When gold hit 850 an ounce, it was enough to cover the entire U.S.  currency supply.  If you want to repeat that process in today's world, gold would have to be around $18,000 in U.S.  terms just to cover the U.S.  currency supply.  Do you believe that this is where... The fiat monetary system is going towards an accounting period, so to speak, where gold, again, covers 100% of the monetary supply.  It right now covers only 7% of outstanding dollars.  What is the take that you have on this? ",

But I think that at some point, the world is going to look at this flood of currency that comes in on every economic slowdown and say that these fiat currencies have lost all credibility.  And gold prices will be much higher at that point.  Somewhere down the road, they have to find some kind of an anchor on currency issuance to restore credibility to currency in general, and gold is the obvious choice for that.  But the numbers, if there was 20% coverage, and I think you need to look at the US dollars in existence worldwide, and if you do that, a 20% coverage would imply $10,000 gold.  but you're talking more like $50,000 gold at a 100% coverage.  So I don't know if we'll ever get to 100%, but I do know also that there's gonna be a lot more dollars created as we keep going through these cycles.  So that number will continue to grow.  The bottom line for investors right now is not to try and overthink precisely what the path will be to get to those levels or where it will end up.  But just to know that we're on that path, we're going along that path.  And for sure, the one thing we're certain of is you're going to want to own gold and silver as we enter these stages and go further down this path. ",

Some of these, after this long bear market being very minimal ownership levels in a lot of different names that have yet to be established.  jettisoned as it were but i do focus on the area.  personally i focus on the area through gold newsletter and we cover about 30 stocks in gold newsletter in our portfolio and the strategies.  really they vary because on the in the early stages of a bull run the junior resource companies that have established resources often and typically with some level of economics applied to those resources.  They're typically very undervalued and they move very quickly.  They can double or triple in the first months of a sustained move in the metals.  But then again, you have the exploration stories that come about really at any point in the cycle, but as a cycle extends and more money comes into the sector and more companies get to put money into the ground and explore for prospects, and there's more interest among junior stock investors, then you see the exploration plays come into the fore.  Right now, our portfolio is kind of a mix.  We have some companies with big established resources.  We have some companies that are pure exploration stories, some that are a mix of the two, and some royalty companies as well.  So we're kind of across the board in our gold newsletter portfolio.  And really, we let the opportunity kind of speak for itself.  We don't toss away an opportunity because it doesn't fit our mold.  for the time being.  We look for companies that have potential to at least double over the next 18 months or so as kind of a criteria for our selection. ",

We know somebody who knows them very well.  I kind of put that advantage to work, keep our ears to the ground, see who has an exciting prospect coming up, who makes an exciting discovery.

And even within that area, within that sector of precious metals, of course, there's a wide spectrum of investments from physical metal ownership to at the other end or toward the other end, the equities, the mining equities.  And then at the far end, the junior expiration stocks in terms of risk and reward, and of course, features and options and the like.

            "text": "I, my longstanding advice to investors is that if you like gold, then you should love silver because in a longstanding secular monetary based bull run in the precious metals where they're all rising, then silver will outperform gold.  By the same token, of course, when that reverses, when gold is falling, then silver will fall more steeply than gold.  But silver is really kind of a non-expiring option on gold.  If gold's moving higher, silver is going to move further and make you more money.  So from a physical metal standpoint, I tell investors to have some gold and some silver.  and spread the risk as it were.  The same thing with the mining equities, you wanna look at both sectors, but the silver equities are really, they're leveraged to silver and silver of course is leveraged to gold.  So if you get into some really good silver equities, then you really have a high powered portion of your portfolio working for you.  So I do like that area. ",
