You can take pictures and photos from there.  There's the fact that we see vessels going over the horizon even when looking through a telescope or zoom lens.  There's skylines going beyond the horizon in general.  There's the Bedford level experiment which does confirm the round earth when you account for refraction.  You can measure the angles between certain spots on the earth.  and And there's the fact that we can only see exactly half of the stars from any particular point on the Earth.  We have gyroscopes and pendulums and I could go on and on, but it essentially doesn't really matter what I say here because anything that I do say is just going to be dismissed with outright denial and ad hoc hypotheses.  As usual.  But the point is, we have tested the shape of the Earth, and it is all consistent with a spinning globe. ",

            "text": "And that's all they show of it.  That's it.  They don't explain what the test was, how it worked, or the results.  They just showed a video of a laser.  Well, by looking up FECore, I found the video that this was from, and in that video, FECore didn't explain the test either.  It's just a teaser of a video that's apparently yet to come.  So I guess we're going to have to wait on that.  But I did find that on their website, they did produce, publish, yeah, they published their results on their own website in beautiful slideshow presentation formats, as all studies are.  And the basic point of the study is that they shot a laser across a lake, and you can see it farther than you would expect on a globe earth, right?  And, of course, there are several things wrong with the study.  The first one that stuck out to me is how they leveled the laser, and they did it by, quote, \"...using the horizon line and visible city lights on the opposite shore as a  reference.\".  That is not how you level an instrument.  That completely fails to account for atmospheric refraction.  If, for example, refraction made the skyline appear higher up than it normally would, then it's not level and it's not shot parallel to the surface of the water.  And a skyline can indeed appear to be higher and more visible, sometimes more than others, because of an effect called looming.  See, a constant pressure gradient can cause constant refraction, which will seem to raise up distant objects.  even from beyond the horizon.  and this is more common in colder conditions because of air pressure and stuff.  and of course this lake was pretty cold when they did this experiment at 9.6 degrees celsius at water level and i think it was 11.6 degrees celsius at 2 meters above the surface of the water.  now in american units that's Pretty cold, okay?  So, they can see farther than normal due to looming, an effect that no flat-earther seems to account for ever, and their calculations of atmospheric refraction are actually pretty useless because they failed to level the instrument correctly in the first place.  Now, I could very well stop there, because that's already damning enough, but I want to point out some more problems, specifically with their calculations of the atmospheric refraction.  See, the equation that they use to calculate the refractivity of air, the modified Edlund equation, as they say, is... flawed, because it fails to take into account water vapor and changing levels of carbon dioxide in the air.  This equation has been obsolete for a very long time.  But that's not the worst thing they did.  Even worse than that is their use of Snell's Law to calculate the angle of refraction, which is the totally wrong way to calculate atmospheric refraction.  See, Snell's Law is used to calculate the angle of refraction when light, or another wave, passes through one isotropic media into another isotropic media, and it calculates the angle of refraction at that barrier.  Now, I'm not going to go too deep into what that means, but to put it simply, the atmosphere is not two different isotropic media.  In fact, it's the opposite.  It is one anisotropic medium.  And that's because air pressure is higher, closer to the ground, and there's lower air pressure as you get further above the ground, especially in colder conditions.  This causes constant refraction throughout the medium as light passes through it.  And when you think about it that way, then the problems with this calculation seem a bit more evident.  I mean, think about it this way.  This equation does not account for the distance between those two objects across the lake.  And surely that would matter, right?  I mean, this is by far the best effort that I've seen from flat earthers to conduct a proper test, but, um, yeah, there's many flaws in it, and it's still pretty evident that they don't know what they're doing.  That said, I am excited to see their video about this test.  Maybe I'll cover it when it comes out.  And I hope that they will understand and accept that criticism is part of the scientific process as well. ",

But, I mean, it's not NASA's job to try to prove the things which, to them, are extremely obvious and already scientifically proven.  And it's not their job to try to prove themselves to conspiracy theorists.  Though their work definitely does prove the shape of the Earth, with what photos and videos they have, and the very fact that they have satellites up in the first place, because those can only work on the globe with gravity model.  And of course you'll deny all of that, and you'll deny that there are satellites up there in the first place, but the point is that they definitely do have their own evidence of the round Earth. ",
