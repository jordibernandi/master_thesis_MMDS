Right now, we're at the Melbourne Police Department.  Visitor parking right over here.  No unauthorized vehicles be on this route.  So Melbourne Police, they got a pretty large police department.  I believe they have a couple of different substations.  As you guys can see here, they got a pin pad that you can bring yourselves in with.  Some of these are siren activated as well.  Pin pad up there.  But yeah, this is what the side of the location looks like.  Looks like you got one vehicle over there.  Let's see, got other.  You in the back.  Got the police athletic leap bus over there.  This is in.  So if you need to get an emergency phone, you can use this button right over here.  After hours, use the intercom system.  So when you push that for help, police will call you.  It's like calling 911.  We have this right here.  And then no tobacco use except in designated areas.  So they're just applying Florida Clean Indoor Air Act on that.  A little place.  And number 360 cruising by.  Some guy already coming out watching.  He's got a bicycle shirt on checking us out.  Already getting contact.  so anyway he's already coming out.  we're gonna ignore him and go back here.  so pretty cool location.  they serve a lot of the i think the beachside area as well.  um there's so much you can do regarding um uh this area.  you got the kennedy space center you got a lot of food and fun places.  that why is this guy coming over here and doing this?  any weapons on you or anything like that?  what are you guys doing?  you don't mind show me your hands i just make me nervous like that.  all right who are you?  are you a police officer here?  why are you guys walking around on parking lot?  are you a police officer here?

I don't have any obligation to give him a name.  What's your name, sir?  All right, there we go.  We're going to get a complaint form.  We'll get up there.  It's already starting.

And sorry again, guys, I got a good east wind coming right at me right here.  As you can see, that sign right here, I'm going to stay on this side of it, just that way.  Got a name yet?  I can go and get your name.  Black shirt.  You got your name yet?  I don't have any obligation to get it.  You can check 901.151.  I just want your name, sir, for complaint.  Like I said, check 901.151.  I just want to get your name.  You said Jack Wagon?  Yeah.  Sarge, you got your body cam on?  No.  You got your body cam on, Sarge?  What's that?  Do you have your body cam on?  No, I don't.  Okay.  I don't know if you have to have one.  You cannot videotape me.  Okay.  You cannot take my video.  If you do, it's a felony.  I will arrest you.  It is a felony?  Absolutely.  You cannot take my video.  What are you doing on the property?  We weren't on the property.  We're just on the estate here.  I heard you filming and taking videos.  I'm going to grab a complaint form inside.  That's fine.  Thank you.  I need to know what you're doing in the world.  You're basing that under the wiretapping statute?  Is that what you're saying, the felony?  Ooh.  Check Smith v. Cummings.  That's the one you need to probably check out.  It's an 11th Judicial Circuit.  Okay.  Okay.  Sergeant didn't have his body cam on.  He was going to affect arrest.  I am getting away from him.  I was gonna see if I can get a complaint form from you.  All right, thank you.  And is your chief available or a road lieutenant?  Yeah, any sergeant supervisor, that would be really great.  That sergeant out there just threatened to arrest me for a felony for videotaping.  That's a very bad thing.  So I need an admin.  I appreciate it.  Like I said, thank you.  And if I could just see if that, like I said, someone above a sergeant is available.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Hey, guys, sorry to bug you.  Are any of you guys less than a year on the road or two years on the road?  Just reason why I'm asking.  I just want you, because Sarge here doesn't want, says it's a felony to record public officials, and I just wanted someone to look up Smith v. Cumming. ",
