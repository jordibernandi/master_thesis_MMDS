            "text": "Yes, sir.  The Bible says, Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.  And after me, nobody else will come.  After me, nobody.  I'm the first and the last.  End of thing.  Okay, so the young man in the front, he says that the Bible says, Jesus says, I am the truth, the way and the life.  After me there is none coming after me.  Well, again, you know, one of the problems we have with religion, is that the religionists, whether they're Christian or Muslims or Jews, we tend to want to claim that our prophet is like the last one and after him there's nothing.  Well, if you study the scriptures carefully, you will see that even Jesus said that, I must go away.  Because if I don't go away, he, the spirit of truth, cannot come on to you.  Jesus was predicting that one was coming after him.  The Jesus of 2000 years ago, he's gone.  But the Christ is today.  The Christ comes today.  And so we don't believe that, you know, There is this thing, like I said to the question earlier on, the prophet is the seal of the prophets.  But Elijah Muhammad, he's the fulfillment of all prophecy.  He's not a prophet.  This one we believe is Messiah.  In your opinion.  In your opinion.  You have your opinion.  This one, we believe this one is Messiah.  We believe that this one is the one who comes to fulfill all the prophecies.  Does he have any revelation from Allah?  Anybody?  Does he have any revelation from Allah?  Yes, sir.  Where is the revelation?  This is the revelation.  It's not the same as the prophet Muhammad.  Well, it's not the same as the prophet... It's not the same as the Prophet.  Allah is revealing things every day to human beings, to any believer.  So all of them are Prophets?  No, no, they're not Prophets.  We just said, why do you keep going over the... I've already told you, there are no more Prophets.  This is not a time for Prophets.  This is the time for the fulfillment in your opinion.  You're entitled to your opinion.  We believe differently.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Well, go and have an argument with the Sufis.  Go and have an argument with the Hanbali.  Go and have an argument with the Shia.  Go and have an argument with the 70 sects of Islam.  All of your scholars are arguing right now.  You all can't agree.  And you kill each other based on your disagreements.  So don't come and tell me and try to dictate to me how I should believe.  Please.  Anybody got a question?  Anyone got a question?  Because we're about to wrap it up.  No, sir.  No, sir.  We're new kids on the block.  We only arrived 89 years ago.  We're brand new.  Brand new.  And that's why when you see the... The crescent on the brothers, a lot of people think this is like the Turkish flag, but it's not.  The crescent moon is a new moon.  The Turkish is the old moon.  This one is the new moon coming in.  And so that's the difference because this is new Islam.  This is reform because the Islamic Ummah is in deviation.  It doesn't mean that all Muslims are terrible people.  Muslims are very beautiful people.  And we respect and honor the Islamic world for keeping this book clean and pristine.  We honor and respect and love Muslims.  But it doesn't mean that the Islamic world is not in deviation.  There is tremendous deviation in the Islamic world and many Muslims today are off the path, they're off the Siratul Mustaqeen because shaytan promised.  He said, I will come at them from their left side, from their right side, from before them, from behind them and I will cause them all to deviate.  And Allah says, and I will fill hell with all those who will follow you.  And so we are here today humbly because I'm a baby in Islam.  I'm a baby in Islam.  I don't profess to be a scholar.  But a little baby can give you some knowledge today if you will humble yourself and listen to what it is that we're saying.  Any more questions?  What is the difference between Shia and Islam?  You need to go and ask them.  You need to go and ask the Shia, what is the difference between them?  Oh, look man, let me tell you something.  The Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, he taught one Islam.  One Islam.  Within a very short period of the Prophet's departure, they were arguing over who will be Khalifa.  Okay.  And so Ali and there was the clash.  And then there was.  of the first four caliph, three were murdered.  Right.  Abu Bakr became the first, but the Shia believe it should have been Ali.  See.  So hold on.  We know the history.  Okay.  So some of you come and ask us, oh, do you pray five times a day?  Yes, we do.  You say, do you know the five pillars of Islam?  Please.  My 10-year-old son knows the pillars.  So let's not waste time talking about things that, rudimentary things.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much for listening.  May Allah bless you all as I greet you in peace.  We say it in the ancient tongue of Arabic.  All praise is due to Allah. ",
