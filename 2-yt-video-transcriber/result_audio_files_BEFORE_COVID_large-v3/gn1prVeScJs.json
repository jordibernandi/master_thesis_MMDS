            "text": "Are we doing something illegal?  Yeah, you're actually recording private property right now.  We're on public property.  It's recording private property against the law.  From public property?  Yeah.  Concerned about cameras and you guys work at a news station?  No, anytime anybody's surveilling the place.  Surveillance?  So is that what you guys call it when you're out doing your stories?  Surveillance?  Oh.  So this is news coverage for us.  Freedom of the press.  Here we are, guys, at Fox 25 News.  Boston.  Or my Fox Boston, as they like to call it.  In Dedham, or Dedham, Mass.  It's right here on a main intersection.  Little sidewalk.  I was saying it looks like how they have in the jails with the road going around the edges.  I've never seen one with a clear thing like that where you can see the whole camera.  Strange.  See how they've created a little bit of privacy with these trees here?  With the leaves are there, we wouldn't be able to see anything.  Sidewalk ends.  Had to put my gloves on.  Mmm.  They live, we sleep.  Sun's starting to come out.  There's the light shining.  How you doing?  Good.  Huh?  Alright, me too.  Oh, someone's in there.  I didn't see them.  It's one of the Securitas, securities.  One of the famous security companies.  She was working on her review.  Were they haunting it?  Yeah, I think so.  He doesn't really care.  He looks about our age.  He's got Bluetooth headphones on.  He's just chilling.  He had his radio.  I'm going to start doing that more often.  I'm going to start saying things like that.  Hello, what's you guys doing?  Hey, who are you?  I'm Joseph.  I'm the decisive security here.  What's you guys doing?  What's your name?  Um, I don't know.  Did you just ask my name?  Yeah.  Um, are you a police officer?  I'm a security guard here, yeah.  Why do you want to know my name?  Because you guys are covering every person that's covering me and I'm the father.  Are we doing something illegal?  Yeah, you're actually recording private property right now.  We're on public property.  Is reporting private property against the law?  From public property?  Yeah.  It is?  Well, you're also reporting every person's vehicle as well.  That's not illegal either.  That's not illegal.  We think.  It's not.  We know.  So what's against the law then?  Do you know what freedom of the press is?  You work in a news agency.  Do you know what that is?  What's your name?  What's your name?  Joseph.  I just told you that.  Your last name.  You don't need to know that.  What's your name?  You don't need to know my name.  I'm not going to tell you.  You're not a police officer.  Okay.  I got a scanner on me, so I'll hear the call come in.  Are you detaining us, sir?  Are you detaining us?  I totally fucked this up.  dude I hope I got that on my body cam As soon as he came out.  I think so.  That's the one that went by beeping earlier.  I know.  They got the thin blue line right on their car.  628D.  Wow, they got the thin blue line right around the whole car, that's crazy.  Well, I think security guard Joe went back in and said something, and he probably mentioned that, granted he mentioned Freedom of the Press, and they told him, yeah, they're right, so, I don't think we're getting a phone call to the police.  Police just went by.  Yeah, he didn't even hit his brakes.  I know.  I don't even think he looked that way.  Like, he might have saw us when he was pulling, coming up towards us, but he didn't, like, keep looking at us.  What's that?  We didn't ask for help.  We didn't ask for help.  We didn't ask for any help.  Thank you though.  I'm just curious.  You got a lot of people inside the building that are just a little concerned.  Concerned about cameras and you guys work at a news station?  No, anytime anybody's surveilling the place.  Surveillance?  So is that what you guys call it when you're out doing your stories?  Surveillance?  Oh, so this is news coverage for us.  Freedom of the press?  I'm not acting as a sports person.  I'm just checking.  I know.  You came up to me, so now I'm having a conversation with you.  Do you have any questions I can answer?  No.  I think I can say something.  No questions.  If we did, we would have either called or maybe went to the security guard and asked if there was anyone we could speak to.  We're just trying to get B-roll footage.  Okay.  have training in how to deal with the public.  He was really rude to me.  Yeah, and he needs to not tell people that we're doing something illegal when we're doing something perfectly legal.  I appreciate you speaking to me with respect.  I have no reason not to speak respectfully to you.  We do this all the time, so I understand if it's a news type situation.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's just, you know, the only reason I came out is because there was some questions about, you know, what's actually going on.  That's the thing.  I'm going to appreciate some of your information.  We were asked to provide a notification of our location.  Well, you still didn't show it either after you said that, so.  Well, I'm on my own property.  Yeah.  And we never came onto your property.  We were standing on the property.  And honestly, Massachusetts doesn't give you any actual real... News identification.  I can't go and get an actual ID.  You can print it out, and that's about it.  You know what I'm saying?  So whether I write a fake one out or not, it doesn't really matter.  It doesn't really matter if it's fake or not.  Yeah.  I can issue my own identification.  It's verifiable.  Yeah, exactly.  So, I mean, I could.  I just want to make sure we're not.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially with privacy information, license plates and stuff like that.  Well, that's our public record, as you should know.  As I know.  I know.  We've been to 7 News before, too.  It's not just you guys.  Okay.  So... That it?  We good?  Yeah, just appreciate you staying on the... We were until you came up and wanted to talk to us.  I get that.  Alright.  Thank you.  Have a wonderful day.  Thank you, you too.  so Bye.  Thank you. ",
