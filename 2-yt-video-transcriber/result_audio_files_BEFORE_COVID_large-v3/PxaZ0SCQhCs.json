What did we miss?  What did we miss?  I know, you keep shocking me.  What are you doing?  Every time we touch each other, there's like electricity.  That's how we knew it was meant to be.  Yeah, Thursday night I'm going to do a stream with Deadhead Animations.  Deadhead Animations gives just stellar advice on talking to people.  How to have conversations about this stuff.  So go check out Deadhead Animations.  The series is called Re-Education.  So I believe I should just refer to it as re-education.  Just don't touch me and you won't get shocked.  I'm sorry.  I've acquired superpowers apparently in the last 10 minutes.  Leftist tech support asked about working within the system.  And this brings us to the like id-polled Professor Carrot section of my video.  In my opinion, if a lot of people misunderstand something that you've said, it means you probably didn't say it clearly enough.  I thought I made this clear, but a lot of people misinterpreted it.  I am not, A, I'm not a class reductionist.  Luna is not a class reductionist.  We believe in intersectionality.  I believe in building dual power structures and alternative power structures.  Somebody in the comments was talking about the Women's Councils of Rojava, which I think is a great formula.  I don't think it's pointless or useless to put minorities and vulnerable people in positions of power.  And I said in the video, Professor Garrett said in the video, that it does have utility.  So just to be clear, Working within the system does have utility.  It has alleviative and palliative effects.  Like, if there are people who are, like, suffering and dying, yes, we need to work within the system to, like, help those people as much as we can.  But Luna, we were talking about this yesterday, and Luna, you know, the way she puts it is it's like putting a Band-Aid on, like, on an openly bleeding wound.  It does help.  It's worth doing, especially if we can do it effectively.  You buying a Patagonia jacket on your own... It doesn't help anybody.  It's great if you like the jacket.  It's great if it lines up with your values, but it's not gonna liberate anybody.  It's not gonna help anybody.  But if like a lot of you come together and boycott a company or have an awareness campaign together, that's something that's much more effective.  I'll say something like toxic masculinity is a problem and we need to address it.  And then right-wingers will say, all masculinity isn't bad.  It's fine to be a man.  Why do you want to shame me for being masculine?  I'm a man, blah, blah, blah.  And it's like they ignored that very crucial modifying adjective, toxic.  I am not talking about all masculinity.  Like by definition, I'm talking about this very specific form of Toxic masculinity.  It's like, I'm not talking about all masculinity.  But leftists, I think leftists do this too.  Like when we talk about IDPOL, identity politics, if I'm saying liberal identity politics have these problems, it's not cool for you to say, American Johnson said identity politics are useless.  American Johnson is a class reductionist piece of shit. ",

John McCain style, Mitt Romney style Republicans, they're like small government is what they say a lot.  So they want to have a small government that gets out of the way and lets the American business white man, usually, the American business person forge a path ahead as an individual.  That's kind of the idea.  But they also at the same time are incredibly socially conservative.  So like they don't want gay people to get married.  This is like the original traditional version and a lot of this is still true.  Either the way it is now or even better go back in time.  So make it like the 1950s whenever, you know, the men were men and the women were women and we didn't have all this gay marriage and everyone was Christian.  Bullshit!  I mean, there are still traditional conservative young people.  And I was one when I was younger.  I wasn't really, I was more like libertarian.  So I wasn't really into like the whole Christian social conservatism.  I, even when I was a right winger, I was like for gay marriage.  I was a shithead in many, many ways.  So if you're raised like in a socially conservative environment, like I was in South Carolina, you're going to have those attitudes and beliefs. ",

That's what they believe.  Well, hold on.  I'm just telling you what they... I'm just telling you what a lot of my family members and stuff believe.  Well, I can't believe that they're legalizing marijuana and gay marriage and our whole society is going to collapse.  This is exactly what happened to Rome.  They say crap like that.  I got this specific YouTube comment yesterday, I think.  Like, well, you can't dismantle hierarchies completely because even if you get rid of capitalism and you get rid of sexism, some other form of hierarchy will pop up.  And some people will always have more power than others.  And that's why anarchism is useless thought.  You know, like fantasy.  I'm an anarcho-communist and to me the communist part is the material part.  It's like very concrete.  The workers should own the means of production.  Anarchism for me is more of the ideal side of things.  So like philosophy and stuff.  And it has everything to do with examining things and analyzing things through the lens of hierarchies and power structures, looking for unjust hierarchies.  If you have never heard this quote before, meditate on it.  It's a very good quote.  Rudolph Rocker said, I am not an anarchist because anarchism is the end goal.  I'm an anarchist because there is no end goal.  And I'm just starting to really understand the importance of that quote because I wasn't an anarchist 20 years ago.  I don't know, but I'm guessing and I'm pretty sure that 20 years ago, most anarchists probably weren't very concerned with trans rights because the trans rights movement was like a lot more closeted and a lot more hidden than it is now.  You know what I'm saying?  But now today, a lot of anarchists and a very important part of our movement are trans people.  I'm just guessing that trans people deal with hierarchies. ",

It takes a little explanation.  This is vintage from the 70s.  I think it used to be my mom's, but I've had it forever.  It might have been one of my aunt's.  I don't know.  I've had it since I was a kid.  Now, here's the thing.  It's a mood ring.  It's a mood ring.  This is like an old 70s thing that people used to give their... Very close comrades.  But I don't know if it's fixed or not, but it kind of got messed up because I brought it from America, and I think the airplane pressure messed it up a little bit.  So we might be able to fix it with a hairdryer.  It's not like a super fancy ring.  I wouldn't, like, shower in it.  It's cool because it's a vintage moon ring, I thought.  That's just, like, your pre-birthday present.  I should have seen that coming.  Is he proposing?  Ha!  Oh, Luna, we got this new thing.  I have a new thing.  Look.  And it's playing.  Here, listen.  This is our outro music.  Good?  It's kind of like a sentimental wrap-up music.  Mm-hmm.  You like that?  Is that good?  This is what you can expect now that we have this new streaming station.  You're going to have all kinds of excitement like this.  Like this.  This is the kind of excitement you can expect moving forward. ",
