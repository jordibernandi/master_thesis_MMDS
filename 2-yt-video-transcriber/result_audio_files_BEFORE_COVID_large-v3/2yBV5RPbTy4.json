            "text": "Good morning, good morning everyone.  Blessings, it's Amanda.  I hope you're having a wonderful day.  I hope you had a wonderful weekend, a wonderful start to your day.  I'm going to release a word this morning and we're going to pray first, but the Lord has given me a very powerful word to release.  I released it on an interview this morning and I'm going to release it here for all of you.  so let's pray and then we'll get into all of this.  father god in the name of jesus christ lord we come before you.  we acknowledge lord you sent your one and only son jesus to die on the cross.  father god to take our place to spare us father god from an eternity without you we deserved an eternity.  without you.  we deserved when jesus did not deserve to die.  father god Holy Spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ, you are welcome.  Come consume this broadcast.  Holy Spirit, have your way.  Let your fire fall.  Father God, let your presence consume people, Lord, and go through people.  Go through people, starting at their head and going to their feet, Lord, like a precise arrow, Father God.  Lord, we praise you for who you are.  You are the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the first and the last.  You are he who liveth and died.  Praise you.  You are alive forevermore.  You are El Shaddai.  You are the righteous judge.  You are the rebuilder of broken down walls.  You are our soon coming king and you are the king of kings.  You are creator of all things and our adoring father.  We praise you this day, Father God, for life, for all you have done, Lord.  We give you all the glory, honor, and praise through your name.  Amen and amen.  Praise you, Lord.  I was given this word yesterday.  I was actually at the hospital.  Please pray for Chris.  He has a CAT scan this morning.  He's been getting a lot of headaches.  They are trying to set a surgery date for maybe about a month from now.  So he's going to have to go back into major surgery unless the Lord has other plans, which I know the Lord can do.  And you know, Chris is going through some growing pains right now with the Lord.  So please pray for him as he pushes through it.  He's going to have to dig down deep for this.  I am praying for him.  I will continue to pray for him.  I am there at the hospital pretty much every day.  uh trying to support him and do the best i can do in the situation with the with the help of almighty god so i will keep you all posted.  he's saying words like yes no and okay.  he's still doing that for the most part but praise god those words are poking through.  he is walking better and better when they do walk him.  otherwise he has to be in the wheelchair because his balance is still wobbly currently, but he is walking better.  And they actually gave me a day pass to take him out so he could actually go to a restaurant and eat.  I took the wheelchair.  We took the cane, took his helmet, and I got to take him out.  And he wanted to go to Outback.  So I took him out to Outback to eat.  And he had a very nice time.  He was so happy.  He got to get out for a little bit.  They had trained me and they trusted me to take him.  And so it was a nice time for him and a bit of a break, which is nice.  So I want to thank all of you for your continued prayers and your support.  It truly, truly means so much to us.  I read Chris' comments.  I read him cards that you send.  So we are deeply touched and moved.  We are so grateful to all of you.  I love all of you.  I am just touched and honored.  You'd even want to look in our direction and help us that you'd even want to watch the channel.  I give all the glory to God for that truly because I am a vessel.  That's what I am.  It is all him.  It truly is all the Lord.  And I give him all the glory for that.  So thank you, everybody.  And I love you.  So we're going to read this word.  There's a lot in this, but it is a very heavy word.  It's got a lot of information.  I praise the Lord that he gave it in his mercy.  So here we go.  By the power of the blood of Jesus Christ, may only the truth come forth.  February 26, 2019.  Going into deeper waters.  People have a voice in this hour.  They have a voice and they have a choice in this hour.  whether they have enough faith and are willing, capital letters, keyword, to go into the deep waters with the Lord.  Those not willing will be left in a waiting pool of lukewarm mess that will stagnate their growth.  There is a crossroads.  People have a choice.  They have a choice.  Deep waters will make way for deep spiritual growth and insight and flourishing of gifts in God's will.  Those left in the wading pool claim they trusted and followed the Lord, who returned to the same stench, the same dysfunction, the same bad habits, the same problems that have produced mess after mess in their lives.  Yes, they have a big capital letters choice, says the Lord, to dive deep in the ocean, to dive deep in the ocean, or wade in a lukewarm, comfortable mess.  says the Lord.  They must choose this day whom they will serve.  People are more attached to family dysfunction than they are to the Lord, and that needs to be reversed, says the Lord.  Those choosing to wade... will be left behind.  They are choosing this road, says the Lord, and I cannot allow those of my children who are my chosen to stay attached to such things that there is no desire for growth and change, says the Lord.  I search out the things of the heart.  I know and examine motives, says the Lord.  My children are not, capital letters, doormats or your possessions or your slaves, maids or scapegoats, capital letters, scapegoat.  The scapegoat is truly getting an escape, capital letters, now says the Lord.  The blame will shift.  Yes, there shall and will be a shifting of blame.  The easy target will not be so easy anymore when gaskets blow and areas leak, exposing the root cause, capital letters, of the blame.  Many, many people refuse to face what they have done, their role in the breakdown of others' lives around them.  Yes, the roles, capital letters, the real roles shall be exposed truly.  The last act, capital letters on last act, says the Lord.  It has come down now to the last act, capital letters.  And there will be a spectacle of truth and information flooding circumstances that have festered way, way too long.  I am stirring up the water, says the Lord, and what has been beneath the surface shall now float, capital letters, to the surface, says the Lord.  There will be no keeping it down any longer, says the Lord.  Someone is about to blow the whistle.  Whistleblowers in the coming days shall arise and open their mouths wide, boiling over.  Things have reached their boiling point, capital letters, says the Lord.  And now it's boiling over.  It cannot be contained any longer.  What was hemmed in, the fence has been broken.  The truth as a stallion bucking in a pen shall burst forth, racing out in all its bravado, says the Lord.  The truth running wild like a stallion, huffing and puffing at the nostrils, staring down the deceptions that have remained for far too long.  this says the lord uh this says the lord of hosts.  this day the deceptors are being dethroned.  they have played a role in the strife of my children's lives.  they have played a role a fantasy role for who they truly are will no longer lay trapped beneath the surface but will rise up out in the great purge says the lord.  the great capital letters purge is here.  I am not only exposing but expelling, capital letters, those circumstances that have bred instability, hurt, pain, that have attempted to drain my children.  These things are being with force expelled from my children's lives to show that I, the Lord thy God, am a God who says what I mean and I do what I set out to do.  There is a fear, fear of their lives.  Those who have an expiration, who have had many a chance to make themselves right before me, the Lord, and they have refused because titles and charades and categories of lies upon lies to present an image to the world has led them down a very bumpy road, says the Lord of hosts.  The largest bump is set to collide with their lives.  The denial that this giant does not exist has indeed fed the beast.  all to give a corrupt name, a false sense of godliness, says the Lord.  Oh, they can talk the talk.  However, my children, you must watch how they walk the walk, says the Lord.  You must carefully watch what their steps choose to draw near to, because in that you will see the truth of their fruits, my children.  The truth of their fruits is clearly emerging.  rotten on the vine, inedible, filled with worms.  The bark was a superficial cover.  For to the core of the trunk these trees are diseased, says the Lord.  Dry, brittle, decayed, says the Lord.  I, the Lord, am set to split the tree in two, for it has attempted its trickery long enough.  These family lines have attempted their trickery and treachery long enough, says the Lord.  My children, my chosen, are not theirs to push and pull as they please.  These are my precious ones, my diamonds that were once coal.  And I will not have them hurt and walking through muck, all capital letters now, and mire anymore because of rebellious people who live in delusions of grandeur.  that is nothing but a faulty cover, says the Lord.  My sheep know, capital letters, my voice, and as strangers they will not, capital letters, follow.  Many of my sheep have for years refused to follow the off tune of a very wayward drummer, says the Lord.  They have stood and refused to bow and fought and resisted, capital letter, key word.  taking shot after shot arrow after arrow.  now I the Lord shall be their shield their glory and the lifter of their heads.  yes I shall capital letters be their shield and those who have pushed and attempted to manipulate them into bowing to the ideals of the Egyptians of the Canaanites and to becoming just another pawn in place.  I the Lord thy God already have checkmate and I shall now reveal this For I am the king, the king of kings, says the Lord of hosts.  For my children who have fought the good fight, especially angelic forces, have been dispatched.  So they are getting now a flood of reinforcements.  For vindication is here, says the Lord.  Special angelic forces have been dispatched to surround my children.  These angels are created for war and special assignments.  And I am releasing them and activating them now to come in with their fiery swords and their power surge in the spirit and pierce, capital letters, the plans of the enemy.  Goring, capital letters, G-O-R-I-N-G, holes in the plans of the enemy.  in these unclean spirits and making a way where there seems to be no way i the lord your god lift you above the fray.  i shall exalt you above the accusations i shall vindicate you before the jealous and the proud says the lord that thought you were nothing more than a toy for them to use at their leisure says the lord You shall feel the heat, my chosen vessels.  You shall actually, capital letters, feel the heat.  And these fiery hedges suddenly ignite around you, and you shall know that I, the Lord your God, am ordering your steps, and I am leading you out from Egypt.  Out from the grasp of the proud Pharaoh, I am opening the eyes of Moses to the truth of who he really is, that he is not an Egyptian, but capital letters chosen and set apart for the work of the Lord.  Moses cannot continue to live, capital letters in Egypt, once it is revealed that he is the chosen of God.  Yes, the difference between the Egyptian and the Jew, God's chosen, will become very clear.  The blurred light shall become clear, says the Lord of hosts, and those who I now bring into focus will realize they have been living in Egypt in the corruption and disregard for Almighty God.  And they will want to head into the wilderness and leave Egypt with all its taunts and its false blessings behind, says the Lord thy God.  The Exodus, capital letters, the journey has begun to become who the Lord needs you to be.  I, the Lord, desire to take my little flock under my wing and train them to spot wolves coming a mile away, says the Lord.  Do not let that spirit into your circle, my children.  Banish it, says the Lord.  The wolf pack is being put on the run, says the Lord, fleeing from the lives of my children, for they will not be able to take the heat of the holy fire around you, of the anointing that encompasses you.  They shall not be able to handle or stand the purity and power of my presence, says the Lord.  A double portion of anointing is being poured out upon you.  My ministering angels have been dispatched with special jars to pour it, starting at your head and going to your feet.  Receive it now in Jesus' name.  You shall be covered in the glory of God and the enemy, the unclean, with those agendas to devour, will not be able to stand to be in your presence and will depart back into the shadows from which they came.  i am stripping them says the lord and they shall leave the land with no more wells to tap into.  for all capital letters they stole they shall now leave with nothing says the lord of hosts.  like i said the exodus has begun.  people are making an exodus an exodus.  rash decisions will set them up for big falls and my children shall be exonerated from the false blame from the irrational accusations that were fired at them like arrows.  for years says the lord I have dispatched my warring angels and they have stolen their quiver, says the Lord, and taken their arrows.  They are weaponless, says the Lord.  Now here comes the flood, the standard, says the Lord.  Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord as your enemies retreat, having nothing left to rise against you, nothing left to fire at you.  However, you have the sword of the Spirit, the weapon of my word, and they will run as you roar, my children, my fierce warriors.  I am setting you high upon a hill.  Where with your eyes you shall see the reward of the wicked.  Psalm 91.  You have made the Lord your shelter.  No evil shall befall you.  And the plague, the curses fired at you, my holy fire, has incinerated, says the Lord of hosts.  You shall see and feel the manifestation of this now as I activate in the natural what I have released in the spirit.  activate it with your mouths my children decree your victory.  you shall have your spoils my children.  they are coming into your hands and you shall raise your hands to the Lord and drop to your knees and praise at Thanksgiving because the battle is already won.  thus saith the Lord of hosts in Jesus name glory to God.  I felt that shoot down my whole body as I was prophesying it.  I pray that it ministered to you, that it blesses you, that you take this and you run with it and you draw in right now to the Lord because there is a lot he desires to pour out on his children because the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty.  through God to the what?  Pulling down and destruction of strongholds.  God bless you guys.  I love you all.  Keep the faith. ",
