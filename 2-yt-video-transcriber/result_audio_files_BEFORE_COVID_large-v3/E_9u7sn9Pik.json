Links in the description for that.  And, well, he just threw his support behind me, which is totally unexpected and really neat.  So, well, you know, I won't even tell you.  I'll just let him say it in his words.  This is David Wood, massive Christian YouTuber, has over 300,000 subscribers.  And I think he just wanted to help me out because my channel is a lot smaller than his and I really appreciate the support.  Here's what David said. ",

It's the second round, and I'm up against Pastor Mike Winger of BibleThinker.org.  Hey, this isn't about ego.  This isn't about winning.  So go to Mike's YouTube channel, check out his videos, and vote for him.  Not for me.  Someone who has 327,000 subscribers on YouTube.  Be sure to vote, but remember, vote against me.  Vote for him.  Not for me.  As a Christian, you just don't.  So, in addition to Pastor Mike's sites, there's a link to the Christian Apologetics March Madness Tournament, as well as a link to the specific showdown between yours truly and Pastor Mike.  Vote for him.  Not for me. ",

Hopefully you guys have a chance to take some time, take a few minutes to go down to the link below and actually cast a vote to see if I can maybe get into round three.  If not, fine.  David Wood's got a fantastic ministry.  Well worth your attention and even your votes.  But I think that we could honor his request and just go ahead and vote for me. ",
