            "text": "If you're looking to travel with your academic department, LU Send is the central hub of support for all student group travel.  We're passionate about helping you get off campus to see the world.  So there's a ton of ways you can achieve academic credit by traveling.  If you're taking Education 305, why not take it in Germany?  Or if you're taking Theology 201, why not take it in Romania?  We want to help you see the world, and the LU Send office will work with you to make it happen.  Now, just about every university offers students an opportunity to travel abroad for credit.  But what makes Liberty unique is that we don't just stop being Liberty when we travel.  Wherever we travel to, no matter your major or degree, you'll also serve along churches and organizations engaging that culture with the gospel while you're there.  Whenever we travel, we ask the question, how can we be more than just tourists?  Instead, how can we serve?  How can we bless others while we're here?  Because at the end of the day, that's how you become a champion for Christ. ",
