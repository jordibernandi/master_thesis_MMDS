You Hebrews, it's on your way.  Hallelujah.  Don't forget, if you're bringing, if you're coming to Passover, make sure you bring some wine and make sure that you come according to the scripture.  You know, if you're real hungry, make sure you eat at home.  This is not just a banquet.  This is actually an opportunity for us to reflect on the Lamb of God.  that because of his blood take away the sins of the world.  So hallelujah.  We give all praises to the Most High, Yah.
