            "text": "So this is solar roadways hitting what must be peak stupidity.  You just can't get any dumber than this.  Think of all the possible places that you could actually put a solar installation.  Maybe the dumbest one would be underground, but only slightly less dumb than underground would be under a tent in the middle of winter when it's raining.  which is more or less what you got here.  Now, this little installation you should bear in mind cost the best part of half a million dollars, and it's the last product of a $2 million Kickstarter, $2 million of government money, and this... I'll give it to them.  This thus far is their best running installation so far in the... There are only two things that give you a clue that it's working.  The first one is can you see the lights working?  Well, in terms of do the lights work, what do they do?  Okay, they flash on and off.  You can barely see them in low light levels in... Yeah, so they're hardly the most visible of LEDs.  But the other thing that it should do is generate some electricity.  Well, there's a website where it did actually register when it was generating energy and it stopped generating energy about a year or something ago.  But they've got a new installation now and apparently it's still not generating any electricity.  But there's one other thing I want you to notice.  It looks like there's a kind of dryish area around the solar roadways.  And I've got my personal suspicion as to what that is.  And that's they've actually.  either they're generating so much heat through the LEDs.  That's one option.  Or they're actually, they're heating them now.  And what you've done is essentially you've heated a huge area of concrete.  You know, this happens over an extended period of time.  Which make, I mean, this is the most, if that's true, this is one of the most unenvironmentally friendly things that you could do.  He's basically just put a giant heater under the sidewalk for no apparent reason.  This thing would be guzzling up the power if this thing is actually running heaters at the moment.  But that would account for why it looks kind of dryish around the outside.  Now, like I was saying, this thus far has been the one where the LEDs have worked for the longest.  You know, the first one bust within a few days.  And, you know, they had other ones that sort of caught fire and all that sort of thing.  So this time it does look... Yeah, this thing's been running now for about a month.  Apparently not generated a single bit of electricity yet.  but they've not had any obvious panel failures.  But I watched some of the bits when they were putting the installation in, and it doesn't look like there's any drainage in there, which basically means that you've got your wires, and if there is no drainage, the whole thing's basically going to fill up with water, which is not a problem until the seals fail and you get the electricity in contact with the water.  Because what you're going to get happen is it's going to start to electrolyse the water and you'll get things like chlorine gas being formed, which will just corrode away everything.  And I suspect that's a large portion of what happened with the old one is they couldn't get the ceilings right.  And so let me know in the comments below how you think this one's going to... What's the survivability on this one?  Now, I'm probably going to be heading to America next summer.  So I'm probably going to swing by this thing once again.  Unfortunately, it'll be in summer, so it won't be so easy to tell if they're actually still sort of heating huge amounts of the pavement for no apparent reason.  But, yeah.  What do you reckon?  How much of this will still be working by then?  Now, I should state that there have been loads of other solar installations around the world that didn't trundle the thing with the LEDs, which is completely pointless.  I mean, you really can't read them from shallow angles, which is what you would need them for if you're using them for signs on the road.  And they don't do anything with them other than just have them flashing lights.  dumb patterns like this.  i mean it's more of a disco floor than it is a roadway of.  well it's not roadway at all.  no car has ever driven on it yeah.  but all the other roadways that they've had they've just been an absolute colossal failure.  you know when the when the cars start driving on them they just smash them to pieces in sort of days to weeks.  um you know that's it.  well that's That's a few million dollars of solar roadway trash.  So if you enjoyed that, give it a thumbs up and thank you for watching. ",
