            "text": "What's up my brothers from another mother got an interesting video for you today.  I get an email from women from time to time.  usually every couple months I get an email getting lectured about something.  so I want to go through an email that I got the other day.  but before I do just want to shout out to the channel sponsor the tactical soap company.  there's a link pinned in the description below and the top comment.  if you check out with coupon code cooper you'll get 10% off tactical soap.  It's pheromone-infused soap.  It's high-quality handmade in the United States.  Consider picking some up if you like the content that I create on the channel.  It certainly helps create more of it.  Let's hop right into it.  So I've had a number of these come to me over the years and some version of this, and I've never really made a video about it.  I did invite this particular woman on to have a live discussion about it, but she hasn't responded in several weeks, so I'm assuming that she's lost her appetite.  but she did send an email and it's essentially lecturing me on some things that she doesn't agree with.  on what i create i'm just going to start from here because the top of it has her email address and her name.  so we're not going to mention her name.  she's in her early 20s and we'll just hop in over here.  so she says i find many of your themes be rather frustrating.  you're probably thinking well duh you're a woman you won't understand and you're right.  okay I as a woman will never fully understand masculinity just as you'll never fully understand femininity.  I agree with that, but I'm a reasonable person, so try to hear me out.  So let's hear out her reasonable arguments.  First off, some of your points absolutely hit the nail on the head.  You stress that men and women are not the same, and you're right.  The more our society denies this, the more it bites them in the ass.  Totally agree.  You also push men to be successful, to be better, to work on themselves.  I love this.  Another thing our society teaches is that high self-esteem equals total self-acceptance.  I accept who I am and that I'm good enough just as I am.  Okay, that's your interpretation.  I long for a society that encourages people to be better, to set goals, to have high standards for each other, and to push each other forward.  Yeah, we've lost that in today's world.  I agree with you there.  But as far as my grievances, well, here we go.  You clearly fundamentally don't like women.  You also try to say otherwise, but when you constantly make negative claims, many pseudoscientific about an entire gender, your overall opinion is clear.  And these antagonistic ideals are not healthy when dealing with the opposite sex.  Let me be clear on something.  I love women, but I dislike toxic feminism.  Now, you say that I constantly make negative claims, many pseudoscientific.  I don't make negative claims.  What I do is I point to the cold, hard truth.  Welcome to Bomber Command.  This is Bomber Command in my house, okay?  And this is where the cold, hard truth bombs come.  And I point to many uncomfortable truths when it comes to men and women.  So don't take it as I don't like women.  I love women.  Number two, you talk about different types of men, alphas and betas, those who have taken the pill or not, men who are in different stages of this acceptance and different stages of self-growth.  And yet when referring to women, it's all women underscore.  Yes, all women.  Whenever I make general references, like all women are a hypergamous, All women are hypergamous.  There's no exception to this rule.  Some women will suppress their hypergamous nature.  Some women won't.  It is what it is.  Just like all men's sexual strategy is, generally speaking, unlimited access to unlimited women, women's sexual strategy, generally speaking, is hypergamy.  More specifically, open hypergamy.  We all have the same desires.  Now she's trying to lump women and men all together.  We all have the same desires.  Well, men and women don't have the same desires.  We have different desires.  And as you pointed out earlier on in your email, you say that men and women are different.  So it's confusing to say the least here.  We're all completely controlled by our biology.  We're all after the exact same thing.  This is just obviously not the case.  I have different goals and my female peers seek different men, have different beliefs.  You have different preferences.  So let's put it that way.  All women have different preferences.  There's some women that love this look, shaved head and a beard.  They love it.  Okay.  Hands down.  It drives them mental.  Other women despise it.  Okay.  But all women are hypergamous.  So you can't argue that.  Different beliefs.  Just as men are different, so are women.  Yes, biology dictates certain tendencies, but it's not realistic to overgeneralize one gender and not the other.  I overgeneralize both genders.  Let's go to number three.  The nine iron rules from the Rational Male promote an awful lot of lying.  Okay, let's see what she says now.  Now, I'm not saying one should wear their heart on their sleeve, especially for men, it shows weakness.  Full disclosure of certain things is earned with time and trust, but straight up lying constantly is not a healthy way to get what you want either.  If you are genuinely the quality person you're striving for, then you generally attract the quality woman.  That's a very incomplete statement and I don't see the nine iron rules as encouraging men to be deceptive or lying.  All it does is it encourages men to make themselves their own mental point of origin, not put up with BS.  You may interpret it as lying because you don't like the rules.  And that's generally speaking, again, I'm going to go large here.  That's generally speaking.  what women do is if they don't like an observation or a light shone on the cold, hard truth, they point and sputter.  Okay, there's something wrong with that.  You know, you've done that wrong.  Your interpretation is wrong because of this or it's manipulative, as you say here.  Let's go to number five.  You sell an idea that success equals happiness.  Being physically fit, financially successful, and equality men are all key factors of happiness, but they don't fully account for it.  Many men at some point in life want to come home to another human being and share happiness with them.  Not all, but many.  You sell the idea that success equals happiness.  See, people usually boil it down when they start to disagree with me with things like money.  You know, physically fit is certainly important, financially successful, meaning you don't open up your credit card statements every month and see that you're carrying a balance that says it'll take you 45 years to pay it off.  uh the the ultimate version of yourself becoming the better version of yourself.  whenever i'm coaching people to put some clarity on this point for you my friend my my dear we'll call you um.  i always say to him look you know on a scale of one to ten with ten being the absolute best version of yourself that's you not me not the other guy down the street not george clooney or elon musk that's you ten being the best version of you and one being the worst.  where do you put yourself?  on the scale Any guy that comes in at a 5, 6, or a 7 has got some work to do.  They definitely have some ability to improve themselves, whether it's become more physically fit, kill off some belly fat, pay off credit card debt, make more money, invest for retirement, chase excellence, buy the toys that they like, pursue passions.  That's what it's about.  That's what I'm talking about.  when I say success equals happiness.  It's more along the lines of becoming a better version of yourself equals success, which then equals happiness.  When you have success, happiness, you have options and options are what all men should have.  They should have the ability to maneuver.  They should have the ability to buy and do things or experiences that allow for that level of self-fulfillment.  So I'm not sure how you've confused that, but that's my response to number five.  Let's go to number six.  I really hope you've gotten this far and not trashed the email yet because this is by far the most important thing I could stress.  You say things like alpha supply seed, beta supply.  I actually never say that.  It's alpha seed, beta need.  And that's more the PG-13 version.  Those of you that have watched me for a while know exactly what I'm talking about.  But this worries her.  that I'm pointing to the cold hard truth that alpha seed and beta need is a reality of hypergamy.  So let's see what she says.  Here we go.  You are intelligent.  You make good arguments.  Men are listening to you.  You are molding alphas and leaders, but you are sending them to wrong places when our society desperately needs them elsewhere.  You are telling them to focus on themselves and play the field.  But we need strong men raising our children, influencing our society.  What do you think unhinged feminism has gotten as far as it has?  Because weak men back down to it.  This will be a good response.  We need to build up our society from the inside out, from families, from fathers and mothers.  And you know what?  I agree with you.  Western society is dying.  Our reproductive rate is not dealing with people that are dying.  We are not replacing Western society.  The only way that the West is doing that right now is with immigration.  And what we're doing is we're bringing people in that don't agree with Western values for the most part, causing a lot of conflict within society today.  But as far as men's obligation to wife up women and have children, I do not encourage that in today's world.  And I will never encourage that so long as family law is hostile towards men.  And it is written in such a way that it encourages women to behave very badly throughout the course of divorce.  It basically encourages women to optimize their hypergamy during the divorce, which I am totally in disagreement with.  No man in their right mind would sign up to jump out of a plane knowing that half the time the parachute would open successfully.  That's essentially what guys are signing up for when it comes to marriage.  And listen, I love kids.  I've got a daughter.  I really enjoy that part of my life, but I went through a shitload of stress because during during the divorce machine if i'm being honest and it was the only time in my life and i've said this before so this is a news where i've actually committed you know considered committing suicide based on the stress level that i was going through.  i mean men post-divorce have suicide rates five times higher than women and you think that men should just go around wifing up women because you said so because we need a strong society.  i'll tell you what.  if if you enjoy my content and you agree with it and you think that feminism is unhinged as you say Why don't you round up the girls and go and march on Capitol Hill and tell them that they should reform family law so that it is equal, at least equal, you know, start with that.  OK, so, yes, I am intelligent and I figured you out, my dear.  I want to raise strong, masculine boys someday.  I want them to grow up to be men, to be leaders.  And I may have a decent grip on what masculinity is, at least relative to some people, but it simply doesn't matter.  I am incapable of teaching this to sons.  the same way a strong father could.  But sorry, and it is not because of my misinformation.  It is because men who are wanting to be masculine are far more receptive to a man's advice.  That's true.  And sorry, and that is an understatement.  It is almost impossible for women to influence a boy to be masculine in any resemblance in the way a man can.  We agree on that.  And yet you tell me that women settle down with betas, like settling down and raising children.  Our next generation, mind you, is weak.  Strong men spreading seed is not enough.  They're also raising our boys to strong.  So she's arguing the fundamental truth of the female sexual strategy, which is open hypergamy.  Alpha seed, beta need.  There's no disputing this.  It's been dealt with a number of times in so many of my videos.  What is your argument there that proves that women are not hypergamous?  I don't see it.  All you're telling me is stop telling guys, you know, alpha seed, beta need.  Stop telling guys not to wife up under the current, you know, regime of family law, right?  I don't get it.  It doesn't make any sense to me.  Anyway, let's keep going down here.  This is the end of the email.  I know it's unlikely you'll reconsider your beliefs after this, but if nothing else, I want you to really mull over the last point I made.  I only care because people like you have an effect on others.  It's important how you influence them.  Well, thank you for your email, young 20-something-year-old.  There you go.  There's my response.  I do get emails like this from time to time from women.  I always find them interesting.  And I will from time to time invite you on if you want to have an open and frank discussion, which is a way that I would like to do it.  I think that would be far more productive where we can go back and forth rather than you send an email lecturing me on what I say or what I do that is wrong or maybe leading people wrong.  I only point to the cold hard facts.  I hold up a mirror and I point to the facts and I let people know where things are and then they decide for themselves going forward.  There's not many people that I've come across.  In fact, you know, the vast majority of the feedback that I get on my videos is an agreement with things and I get people telling me, you saved my life.  You know, a few months ago, I had a gun in my mouth and I was ready to pull the trigger until I saw this video or I had a noose around my neck.  that something that you've done sweetheart because i have.  i've helped men become a better version of themselves.  i encourage you guys to write a comment below.  let me know what you think this is in my estimation in my view anyway.  um and i don't think that she's doing this in a way that's uh you know disparaging or anything like that.  but the thing when it comes to women when they watch these videos not a lot of them get it from the perspective of the reality of the sexual marketplace and the way that men have to navigate it.  And I'm not just talking about the sexual marketplace, guys.  I'm talking about the world as a whole.  When it comes to you chasing your passion, your excellence, putting your little dent in the universe, whatever that may look like, it's not just about women.  I think there's far too much emphasis in the manosphere placed on chasing tail.  I agree with that component.  But there are other parts of the manosphere that are completely accurate and correct and i encourage you gentlemen of course leave a comment below.  let me know what you think.  is she right?  is she wrong?  am i off?  let me know.  give it a thumbs up.  somebody needs to see this.  share it with them.  guys this is just female nature.  uh their solipsism doesn't allow them to see things from the male perspective And, you know, in fairness, we're never going to see things from the female perspective.  But the way the world is right now, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to help men live a better life to become a better version of themselves and to optimize themselves and make themselves their own mental point of origin.  And making yourself your own mental point of origin is going to require that you're going to stop putting up with some crap.  And there's some crap that women will throw at you that you're going to stop putting up with, which may result in emails coming to me like this.  Anyway, we'll wrap it up on that note.
