            "text": "Now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse But I know I'll see your face again.  Yes, baby Welcome to Hive Mind, this is the speaker.  Today I wanted to talk about something that a lot of us deal with or someone that we know has been through and that is drug addiction.  I, for one, can speak on this pretty personally, and I'm going to here on the hopes that maybe it might help others that are going through it or that have been through it.  And to know that you're not alone.  It's very common, especially for those in the red pill movement or the truth movement.  It seems to be a prerequisite for a lot of us.  ripping off the veil in my case.  I've always had a problem with addiction in general whether it be cigarettes whether it be eating.  I've always been inclined to head towards those things.  I don't know why.  I don't know if it's just a self-destructive thing I've always been pushed towards but I started smoking when I was about 12. till I was about 13 I moved on to about marijuana And from marijuana, as I got older, I started getting to hard drugs.  I started to do acid, ecstasy, and this was in my early teens.  From there, though, it started to get worse gradually, but it did to my main addiction and the thing that really I've struggled with for a long time.  And I still do struggle with from time to time.  It still pops into my head.  And the reason I'm making this recording at uh... what what is it to two in the morning is because i just i just woke up and i just had a dream relating to that and that is ice addiction or methamphetamines, depending on what country you're in.  I started smoking ice when I was about 19 when I first met this girl that was into it.  And I gradually started to do it.  But once again, not on a serious level, maybe once or twice a week.  Flash forward five to six years.  That was the time when I really started to do it on my own.  And that is when you know you have a problem.  That is a great indication of when shit is taking a really bad turn.  When you start doing those drugs, not as a recreational thing, but you start doing them as a way to just keep moving forward.  and you're locking yourself in your room and you're just getting high and i went through a stage and this was not long ago.  now actually come to think about it but long enough for me to say that you know i'm clean i've beat it and but i still do struggle with it.  i was spending roughly oh god hundred dollars a day looking back on it so that's that's 700 bucks a week was going on ice.  oh i'm not proud of it but i i did a lot of bad things to get that money.  not all that i'll go into but it was such a struggle and I just felt like shutting myself off from the world.  whether something went wrong something little or something big i would get treated to smoke.  i went days days sometimes being awake we're talking like four or five days like in inhuman amounts of time.  i i held it pretty well together.  like i i still had a roof over my head.  i wasn't broken anyway but i was showering.  i was doing my hair in the morning i was going to work.  i was really good at faking being sober But there comes to a stage where you can't fake it anymore because your body's deteriorating, your mind's deteriorating, and it is so, so destructive to every part of your being.  mentally, emotionally, and physically.  I was finding it hard to exercise, do walks, and I just was consistently smoking.  I was coming back from work at lunchtime and smoking.  Sometimes I was smoking in my car at work.  It got really, really bad.  Really, really bad.  But not as bad as some.  And I know a lot of us have similar stories, whether it's abuse that we've done to ourselves or abuse that has been happening to us.  Coming through those things, conquering those things, seem to really awaken something.  And that's another reason why I'm here.  Another reason why I'm doing.  what I'm doing is because when I woke up from that, I found something deeper, a deeper meaning in me, a deeper purpose.  than just your white picket fence dog family.  But back to the struggle of it.  How I kind of started wielding my way off it is it took a lot of time and I was still... I had to move back home at this stage.  Of course I did.  I didn't have the money.  And I got so blatant towards it.  It started taking so much control over me that I... Was just sometimes smoking, leaving the door open, and leaving my drugs just on my table.  Like, that's how much I just stopped caring about shit.  Until eventually my dad came home one day and I was passed out on the bed and all my drugs were on the table.  you could just see it plain as day and my dad's a very kind person a very genuine person and that absolutely broke him.  just to see where my life was going he pulled me aside absolutely in tears and he tried to talk me out of it.  I didn't want anything at that stage.  I was like I'm fine.  what are you talking about?  just doing it recreationally?  it doesn't have control over me.  it did.  it did definitely have control over me but it's very easy to lie to yourself definitely lie to yourself when you have serious problems that continued for one or two years on and off.  i'd promise him that i wouldn't do anything or something like that and i'd still be doing it just not as much and waiting my way off.  it actually got so bad to a stage and this is a hard story to say but this is the truth.  this is how much control these these sort of drugs can have on you.  one day i was with my girlfriend.  we were having sex and my dealer called me.  i was waiting for a call for him and i got up in the middle of that.  i stopped Picked up my phone, got my clothes on, and I went to get some drugs.  Nevertheless, we broke up.  No wonder I was an arsehole.  That's the most ridiculous shit to do.  And looking back on it now, it's just like, damn, that's horrible.  horrible thing to do to someone and to even do that to myself.  and then it happened a second time my dad found it again and he was at a stage where he didn't really know what to do and I could see the pain in his eyes and I could see how disappointed he was in me.  and my dad's got enough problems with his health his life That to see his son go down that road was really the trigger that kept hitting me home and kept really trying to reinforce me to quit and to do my thing.  Eventually, and this was the hardest thing I had to do, I got my bike, I looked in my bag that I had, that I kept my gear in, and I looked in my bag and there was hundreds and hundreds of empty little baggies.  and that fucking hits hits your mind and like that.  that's like that.  this is how much and i sat there and i counted them.  i counted the amount of money that i spent and i counted the amount of damage i did not only to myself but my family and those around me because it starts penetrating and starts affecting those around you and it really does by your actions.  it's fucking difficult man.  it's difficult but i threw all them away.  i grabbed my pipe and i went to my room.  i went out of my room sorry And I gave it to my dad and I told him to throw it away for me.  That was the hardest thing to do.  Like that was the hardest thing to do.  But to see the joy on his face that I was actually trying to make a change and trying to switch all that up was amazing.  looking back on it because he knew I was fighting.  and he knew I was trying, and he was giving me all sorts of support, and I'm very, very lucky on that, because some people don't.  Some people don't have that figure to help them.  Flash forward, actually, no, I'll tell you the recovery process of it first.  It took a long, long time for me to get even mentally back to stable.  I was cold sweats, attacks that I can't explain like I was just getting edgy and it's really crazy recovering from those sort of things.  your body's kicking in it just wants more and you know all you have to do is go down and get some.  all you have to do is go down and buy some and it was so easy for me to get gear.  there were so many people I knew like it literally would take me five minutes to go down the street get some.  so i had to fight back that problem and i did relapse a few times.  but as soon as i relapsed i got back on it almost directly.  so i'd relapse get back on it and even the next day after smoking i'd be like don't fuck that and i throw it away or i'll break it again.  and i just had to continuously fight that for a while and i've been clean for two years now just before i started getting on twitter and started doing that.  that was probably the last time i smoked and The reason I wanted to share this story is mostly to help others and to know that.  I know a lot of you have been through that and you're really not alone in saying that.  People understand and people know that you've been through these things, you've struggled and you've fought.  And even for those that are still fighting now, still struggling now, it's very easily possible.  Because if I can put that shit down, if I can stop that shit, jeez, anyone can.  Anyone can understand.  fight with it and if you are having a problem with that or you're struggling in any way write me a message or tell me your story under the comments or even a private message if you don't want it to be public and we'll definitely try to get back to you.  i'll help you in some way.  i'll drop some links to some helplines and stuff down the bottom and i just wanted to share that with you today.  so hopefully it got something out of that and hopefully you learned a little bit about me where i stand and how i got to where i was.  thank you for joining.  i will be back in another podcast soon.  day ravenous.  It's getting me down, my love Like a cat in a bag Waiting to drown.  This time I'm coming down. ",
