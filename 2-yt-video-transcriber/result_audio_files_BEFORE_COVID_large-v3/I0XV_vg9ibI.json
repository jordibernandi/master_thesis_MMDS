            "text": "All right, we have another question here at the door tonight.  This shouldn't take too long.  Is it a sin for a Christian to go to get a license to carry and then carry a gun?  No, but it might be a sin not to carry a gun.  Now, you won't understand this issue if you don't know the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven.  In the kingdom of heaven, Jesus at the beginning of his ministry told them to go out and preach and don't take bedding.  Don't take an overcoat.  Don't take an extra pair of shoes.  Don't take books.  Don't take food.  Don't take any money.  The clothes on your back, just go to the next city and begin to preach and whatever house you enter into, eat whatever they give you and don't ask any questions.  That's what he told him to do.  He said, if somebody smites you on the right cheek, turn the left.  They want your coat, give it to them.  If they make you go a mile, go to with them.  And that's kind of radical.  That's what he told him to do.  He said, and preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand, not the kingdom of God.  Now that kingdom that Jesus told them to preach and that turning the other cheek that he told them to do.  WAS A TEMPORARY CONDITION BASED ON THE COMING OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.  IT WAS NOT A PERMANENT STATE.  THAT'S CLEAR IN SCRIPTURE.  GET MY BOOK, EIGHT KINGDOMS, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN DETAIL, VERY CAREFUL DETAIL.  TOOK ME 20 YEARS TO WRITE IT.  NOW, LUKE 22, 28, YE ARE THEY WHICH HAVE CONTINUED WITH ME IN MY TEMPTATIONS, JESUS SAID, AND I APPOINT YOU A KINGDOM.  as my father pointed unto me, this is about a kingdom, that ye may eat and drink at my table, so forth, so forth, so forth.  And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day till thou hast denied me three times.  And he said unto them, when I sent you out without purse, so he just announced he's about to be crucified and they're all going to deny him.  So this is his last night with them.  said when i sent you out i sent you without purse without script without shoes.  did you like anything?  and they said nothing.  so jesus is referring back to matthew.  5 6 7 and 8 in there where he could where he gave the conditions for them to go out and preach and be passive be pacifist he said.  when you went out like that did it work for you?  they said yes it did work fine said unto them.  but now but that's a reversal.  that was then.  but now he that hath a purse let him take it and that contradicts what Jesus told in Matthew.  and likewise take his script.  and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one.  so the most important item for them at this point was to go armed with a sword.  this wasn't for peeling oranges This was a sword, not a small knife for kitchen use.  This was a sword which everyone knows is used for self-defense.  So Jesus commissioned the disciples, his last day with them, told them that the old system was no longer in force because they were crucifying the king.  so the kingdom wasn't coming.  Back to the old system again.  Back to old planet Earth where evil reigns and rules.  Back where evil men come to attack you?  He said now I say unto you if you don't have a sword sell what you've got and go out and buy one.  And they said lord behold here are two swords.  so there was already two swords on these 11 apostles here.  So 20 of them were already armed.  And he said it's enough.  In other words, that's sufficient for now, the two of you out of five.  You know, if two out of five solid citizens in America were armed, you wouldn't have all this stuff going on.  Just a couple weeks ago in a place of business, a man pulls out his gun and starts to shoot, and a preacher pulls out his and puts him down.  Now, if every preacher and every Christian, every layman were well-armed and disciplined, it'd put an end to all this crime and stuff that's going on.  And he came out, we'll skip that, no, John 18, 10.  Simon Peter having a sword, this is just a few hours later, they're in the garden, Jesus has been praying, the soldiers come into the garden to capture Jesus.  They surround him, the high priest are in the front pointing, saying, that's him.  Peter pulls out, wouldn't you know he'd be one of them and have one of the swords.  He pulls out his sword, makes a swipe at the head.  the servant the servant ducks takes his ear off and so there's about to be war.  I mean they the soldiers are ready to put Peter down could have killed them all.  at that point Jesus stops them bends down picks up the ear out of the dirt sticks it back on the man's head rubs it like that it's healed.  you see what people feared him and said they fell down backwards.  the soldiers did.  they feared him.  should fury.  service name was malchus.  they probably knew that because he got saved later.  every time he testified I said I just won't tell you about my ear here.  then Jesus then said Jesus unto Peter put up that sword into the sheath.  he didn't tell him to get rid of.  it's not right for you to go armed.  he said put it back in the holster carry it but this not the time to use it.  HE SAID, THE CUP WHICH MY FATHER HAS GIVEN ME SHALL I NOT DRINK IT?  IN OTHER WORDS, I CAME TO DIE, LET'S DON'T PREVENT IT.  NOW, FINALLY, IN ROMANS 13, 1 THROUGH 7, It said let every soul be subject to the higher powers for there's no power but of God the powers that be ordained of God.  He's talking about the police the judges and the officials the president and the House and the Senate.  Whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God for they that resist you're receiving themselves damnation.  Now some people say, I just can't see that.  I can't see that the head of the Communist Party, I can't see that Mussolini, that Hitler, that different presidents, I can't see that they are ministers of God to execute wrath.  I can't see that God appointed them there.  Yes, there are usurpers to the throne, but let me ask you a question.  Where there is no government, no government at all, what is a community like?  No police.  No one enforcing laws or rules where you can steal with impunity, rape, pillage.  What happens?  It's post-apocalyptic in nature.  The world descends into battles, to small groups, kills, maims, destroys infrastructure, and before you know it, you've got tribal people whooping around a fire with their faces painted, their clothes half gone, carrying and shaking spears because there's no one that can go to a factory and build a gun or ammunition anymore.  You go back to the Stone Age.  That's what happened without government.  Governments are appointed by God.  Why?  Because God knows that this world is crooked, sinful, and wicked, and the impulses of sinful men can only be controlled by authorities that wield the sword, that can put people in prison, put them in jail, can shoot them with water cannons, with rubber bullets, with bean bags, and finally with real lead.  And that kind of thing makes people stay at home at night instead of coming to your home.  It is when people are armed and the military is armed and the police are armed that there's order in every country in the world.  Even the poorest, most lousy North Korea.  You can't get away with crimes in North Korea.  even there there's a structure that allows continuity of life from one day to next.  it may be poor life it may be a life of poverty and suffering for many people but it is the government is a minister of god to execute wrath upon those that do evil.  It said, verse 4, for he is the minister of God to thee for good, but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the sword in vain, for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.  So be very clear.  God is in favor of the use of violent force to maintain control and order in this world.  God is not a pacifist.  there is a heaven and a hell which means god is not a pacifist.  there's a day of judgment when god rebukes.  that means god is not a pacifist.  god makes alive and god puts to death and so god is not a pacifist.  and if you're godly you're not a pacifist.  give you a story down in belize.  we went down there and there's an amish community lived on the border close to guatemala And the Guatemalans would come across the border and steal from the wealthy Amish.  They found that the Amish didn't resist them.  They were pacifist.  So they came into this man's home with his daughters there and they took all of his goods and stuff of value, took his money.  Took three or four of the men prisoners.  AND TOOK THEM OFF TOWARD THE GUATEMALAN BORDER, KEPT THEM IN THE JUNGLE AND DEMANDED A RANSOM OF SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE OF THEM.  ONE OF THE MEN TOLD THE GUATEMALAN, SAID IF YOU'LL LET ME GO, LET US ALL GO, WE'LL GO BACK AND RAISE THE MONEY AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO YOU.  AND THE GUATEMALANS LET HIM GO.  HE WENT BACK, RAISED THE MONEY, WENT BACK DOWN THE JUNGLE, FOUND THE GUY AND PAID FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS.  Now the Guatemalans like that.  So they came back and now they came into his house.  They said, we want your daughters.  So they raped them right there in front of him repeatedly, but he's a pacifist.  He didn't believe in violence.  He believed that God takes care of you.  Now, when he gets to heaven, say, God, why didn't you take care of me?  God will say to him, did you know that you could have bought a shotgun for $50?  You know, you could have used a machete.  a stick a frying pan.  you know that i gave you the ability to defend your daughters that unto death you could have fought you could have defended them.  you're the fool that paid those guys and taught them that you're pacifist.  don't blame it on me.  i appointed people to bear the sword to be a revenge of wrath to execute judgment upon those that do evil and you decided you didn't want to do that.  you wanted to follow the old kingdom of heaven doctrine that I'm net nullified the day before I was crucified.  you wanted to go back to you look more like a coward.  then you do a good Christian and eggs.  those girls never were right in their head.  after that we watched him as they grew older grew up.  the came here actually live and mess them up bad.  so no I'm not a pacifist.  if you claim to be a Christian you are a pacifist.  don't be around me anywhere.  Don't come around me because we're not pacifist.  We believe in America.  We believe in God.  We believe in the Bible.  We believe in guns.  That's all. ",
