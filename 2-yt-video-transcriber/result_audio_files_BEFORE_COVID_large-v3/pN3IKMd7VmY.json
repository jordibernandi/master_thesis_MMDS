They were talking about the Steven Crowder YouTube thing, which I'm not going to get into now.  But I will get into that.  Joe made an unfortunate comparison between Steven Crowder's gay baiting and bigotry towards Carlos Massa and the incredibly hilarious and very fun, such fun content that I do and Sam's does about Dave Rubin that I even have a sense.  I'm totally projecting here that Joe might actually enjoy some of our content on Dave Rubin.  And even though Dave might be an associate of his, I have no idea.  I'm just projecting.  I'm just using a little bit of my metacognition from meditating here.  That's my guess.  But then Joe Rogan, who seems like a really nice guy, this happened.  And this was super unfortunate. ",

Invite him on the show.  And then he gave me the follow.  And I said, which was a really big deal.  So then I tweeted back and I said, no worries, brother.  And now is as good a time as any to have an open, high-level exchange of ideas.  And I will do ketamine.  I will smoke.  I will talk about it.  If we spent two hours talking about Illmatic, but my goal would be, that Joe Rogan would do Sam Harris impressions with me because the thing, cause no, honestly, like I, I liked Joe, like Joe Rogan was friends with Dave Chappelle.
