What are your thoughts and what's your analysis on this kind of new politician that people love to hate or everyone is just obsessing about? ",

            "text": "Well, first of all, if you're not controversial in a world that's absolutely insane, then what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Imagine being acceptable in a world that's insane.  I mean so that's starting point.  if you're not controversial then.  Might be worth asking why not.  But you have brought up a very important subject and I don't know how much tape there is but I mean I could talk about this for ages because there's so much many aspects to it.  Casio Cortez.  is the personification and the natural outgrowth and consequence of what has been happening in American universities and colleges for so many years now and not just there.  of course there is something a process I've been observing for a long time which is something will start often in terms of the Progressive movement shall we say and I'll.  Go on to challenge shortly will whether progressive means what it's supposed to me.  It starts in California.  And then it moves across America and then it moves across the Atlantic.  so what we're now seeing for instance in British colleges and universities is exactly the same.  Process.  And it had to.  Eventually.  produce an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because people very simply go through college and university.  they add years to their age and eventually they become adults.  and what do they do?  enter politics.  so she is basically the first wave and ladies and gentlemen it is a wave of this.  Progressive mentality this extremist progressive mentality.  Which claims to be.  Liberal.  But he's actually the very.  Opposite of liberal.  Liberals true liberals.  I'm not talking about political liberals and let's talk about the.  The definition in the dictionary of liberal.  it's basically someone.  Who wants maximum liberty maximum freedom.  maximum right to choose their lifestyle maximum freedom of speech.  And opinion.  So I've already demolished.  The claims that this progressive.  Mentality has for.  Employing the word liberal to describe itself.  it is the opposite of liberal and you know you know Luke what's kind of.  stunningly ironic from someone who's lived what 66 years now.  The speed at which the former liberal.  Left that I grew up in.  That I was a supporter of.  How it's been hijacked.  it's such a speed.  by the very opposite of everything it stood for.  if Martin Luther King.  Looked at a Casio Cortez and this whole.  Progressive.  Tyranny.  He would probably weep.  And yet such is the self-deceit and self-deception that this anti liberal.  progressive mentality sees itself as the modern day civil rights movement.  And just look at what it's saying.  Basically the state authority.  Not even that.  Billionaire owned internet corporations.  Do you remember when the liberal left was against billionaire corporations?  remember that.  I still do but I've got a good memory.  And that these corporations and.  And the state in general.  Should dictate.  What people can say what opinions they can have.  And their right to express them and the right to have the means of circulating them.  We now have this extraordinary alliance.  between the fake progressives the fake liberals.  And.  Billionaire corporations so that when people that the progressives don't like their opinion when they are censored.  By these corporations.  The progressive mentality starts breaking into applause and cheers.  now the original true as opposed to Alexandria fake liberal left would have been in the streets.  you know I remember as a kid in the sixties seeing the on black-and-white television seeing the students at Berkeley going out on protest demanding freedom of speech.  now there are protests To delete freedom of speech.  Now some things happened here.  And the.  Truly liberal left.  Has been hijacked.  And has been replaced.  By something that.  I would have called.  And I will still call.  But I would have called.  Years ago.  The far right.  Because if you.  If you look.  At the classic.  example at the far right the Nazis but you look at Stalin you look at any tyranny.  what's the first thing they want?  when they get control of power they want to delete all opinion and all information that would get people to see them in a light they don't want to be seen.  So when people were trying to expose the Nazis.  In Germany.  They shut them down.  They banned their public meetings.  They burned their books.  And.  The same with Stalin the same with all tyrannies.  So here we have.  The fake.  Liberal left.  That's hijacked the.  Democratic Party with.  Billionaire.  Money from people like George Soros.  Come to women a second.  Who are employing and demanding.  The same.  Responses to alternative opinion.  But the Nazis used the Stalin used.  silence them shut them down ban them.  And they are so.  so permanently located up their own backsides.  it's too dark to see anything.  And thus they are so lacking self-awareness.  they cannot actually see.  That the way they're behaving and the world they're demanding is is introduced.  Is the same world.  That they rail against?  you're a Nazi?  are you against being a Nazi?  yeah.  But why are you acting like one then mate.  Yeah.  But you know tyrannies are tyrannies.  You can call him nazi you can call him stalinist you can call them marxist.  But they're still tyrannies.  and because they're tyrannies they they use the techniques of tyranny.  And the currency of control of tyranny which is always based on censorship.  and when I look at a cassio cortez and what she represents.  When I see that Michael Moore calls for it to be leader it just gives me more confirmation that.  She needs to be very carefully looked at.  As does Michael Moore.  But when you look at Marxism.  First of all Karl Marx was the bankers boy.  You know he wasn't some guy fighting for justice for that.  For the working class he was the bankers guy.  and think about it this way.  The goal of the few what.  People refer to these days of the 1%.  Is control its global control its centralized control.  and why?  why centralized control?  because it has to be.  When you are a few and you want to control everyone else you have to centralized decision-making.  The more diversity of decision making you have the less power any central cabal is going to have.  Now there are two ways of what two main ways that you can.  Secure that power at the center.  One is to accumulate the vast majority of the wealth and through that own governments and own the means of.  control that way which is the capitalist as it's called way of doing it.  but there is another way of doing it with the same banking 1% class in control.  And that is to sell.  A structure of society.  On the basis of government of the people.  We represent the workers we do.  And you sell it as a people's revolution.  And what you do is you create a structure of control where the whole society is a hierarchy of top-down control as we saw in communist Russia and we see in communist China.  And the few then sit at the center of that structure and control everything.  Does anyone think that Stalin was running Russia, the Soviet Union, for the working class of Russia?  Does anyone think that the hierarchy in China are running China for the working class of China?  I mean, do me a bloody favour.  But it was sold as a revolution of the people.  so how does marxism work?  because marxism is basically what this is all structured.  Of course the classic.  Expression of marxism was.  Struggle.  The struggle the class struggle.  Basically what that's founded on is transforming society through conflict between groups.  that way conflict between classes.  What we're seeing now with a Casio Cortez I'm not pointing out she's she's become the face.  I'm talking about the mentality she represents.  The class struggle.  Transforming but the same structure the same means the same goals into the self-identity struggle.  Now to do that.  What you have to do is form groups of self-identity.  What you absolutely must never do or Marxism is going to just collapse is.  you must never treat individuals as individuals.  irrespective of their color religion culture income bracket.  you must never treat anyone as an individual.  you must never look at people by their individual behavior.  Because if you do.  This these groups that you want to play off against each other in the self-identity struggle of Marxism modern Marxism.  collapses.  because whether you are white black or orange with blue spots I'm not going to judge you by the color of your skin or your background or your income bracket or any of it.  I'm going to look at your behavior.  and if you're a if you're a white man who's a psychopath I'm going to call you out as a psychopath.  And if you were a black.  Man who's a psychopath I'm going to call you out as a psychopath and you.  Whatever you are if you're a psychopath I'm going to call you out as a psychopath.  You're not a white psychopath.  in a black psychopath in a I don't know Hindu psychopath you're a bloody psychopath.
