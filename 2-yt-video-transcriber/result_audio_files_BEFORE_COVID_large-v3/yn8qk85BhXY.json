            "text": "Hi, I'm Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis, the Creation Museum, and the Ark Encounter.  Okay, I have a riddle for you.  Guess where you think the final rounds of the National Bible Bee Competition and the awards ceremony and the event celebration is going to be held?  I'll give you a clue.  It's sort of unique in the world.  It's where we have the biggest timber frame structure in the world.  The icon counter, of course.  And it's going to be at the new ANSYS Center, 2,500 seat, multi-purpose center.  Spectacular screen.  And there'll be spectacular lights.  It's going to be absolutely phenomenal.  I tell you what, when I heard that they wanted to hold the award ceremony, the event celebration, and the final rounds of the National Bible Bee Competition at the Ark Encounter, I was really thrilled.  See, for a number of reasons, but one of them is because I just so love to hear about people, young people, who are learning the Word of God, who are hiding the Word of God in their heart.  You know, this is an interesting exhibit here at the Creation Museum.  We call it the legacy exhibit, actually, because as I say to people, the Ark Encounter, the Creation Museum, the Ministry of Answers in Genesis is really a legacy of parents.  who taught their children to stand boldly on the word of God, unashamedly on the word of God, who taught them how to defend the Christian faith and answer skeptical questions.  They taught us lots of answers to help us get to that point of, you know, not succumbing to doubts because of what the world was saying in the attacks on the Bible.  And they taught us the gospel of Jesus Christ.  This is my father's Bible here.  Now, my father went to be with the Lord in 1995.  And when my father was dying, a younger brother of mine was sitting with him and said, Dad, why do you love God's word so much?  And he said his father died when he was 16 years old, so he didn't have an earthly father.  So he turned to the words of his heavenly father and he read them over and over and over and over again.  And he so loved the word of God.  And he would never knowingly ever compromise the word of God.  And he learned how to answer skeptical questions.  And he made sure that for us as children, we were taught the word of God, to hide God's word in our heart and many, many verses of scripture.  we learned as children that my mother and my father, both of them taught us.  And that's why there is a ministry called Answers in Genesis, the Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter impacting millions and millions of people every year because of parents who taught their children the Word of God.  And so I'm just excited, I really am excited that we're hosting the final rounds of the National Bible Bee competition at the Ark Encounter.  Now, you can be a part of it, and there's gonna be a link on the screen where you can find out how you can be there for the final rounds of the competition, for the award ceremony, and also for the event celebration.  And visit the Ark Encounter and go through all the exhibits and see our Christmastime lights that are absolutely spectacular, and the Ark that's lit up in the rainbow lights, and also the Glice Rink, where you can actually.  Well, I don't know what you call it, actually, but you skate on a synthetic ice rink.  It's the biggest one in the United States of America.  So there we are.  I hope that you can come, and I'll see you there. ",
