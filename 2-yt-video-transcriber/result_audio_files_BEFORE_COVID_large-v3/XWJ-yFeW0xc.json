            "text": "This is Jay, Twisted Christian.  I'm back with a video.  First of all, I'd like to thank you guys for your financial support.  For those who have given, I really appreciate it.  It has come in a desperate time of need with everything that I have going on in my life.  I'm really trying to get this YouTube channel going because there's a lot of information.  Some of you guys really enjoyed the videos.  I'm back on it.  And what I want to talk about today is, you know, one of the things that I've discovered.  And first of all, I'm going to show you guys.  I'm circling here these two videos.  All right.  And I'm thoroughly convinced that the Iraq dinar will not revalue until some things take place.  And I think that a lot of us, including myself, have been wrong about a lot of things.  Because you know what?  It's not going to be about, oh, there's so much dinar in circulation.  Oh, you know, they're getting all these oil contracts.  Oh, they're doing this.  They're doing that.  Iraq is on the center stage.  You know, let me tell you something.  Before, in 2004, when the Central Bank of Iraq released the dinar, what was taking place all the way from there until when ISIS took over?  You mean to tell me in the 10 years that with everything that was going on, the different presidents, all the time that they've had, the rebuilding, the reconstruction, all the economic boom between 2004 and 2014, and they couldn't revalue their currency?  They never intended on revaluing the currency.  People say, oh, George Bush, George Bush, you know, he's... He, he signed an executive order, allowing us to buy Denar.  Well, what, well, why?  in the years that he was in office, it didn't take place.  And the person that came after him definitely was not going to allow it to happen.  They never intended on allowing it to happen.  And all of their plans, because of who the current president of the United States is, everything was thrown off everything, all their plans.  They never intended on doing it because if they did, they would have done it already.  They could have done it five, six years after the new dinar was released.  I mean, what happened to all the money in the currency auctions?  I mean, if you go back, you look at the currency auctions all the way back to 2004, sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars every single day.  And this has been going on since 2004.  Where is all that money?  Where is all the money that the United States gave to Iraq?  They never intended on revaluing the dinar.  It was never in the plan for the elites to do that.  You know, over the last couple months, you look at this.  Here, this must have happened before the dinar revaluation.  Mass arrests.  First is the new question.  Over the last couple of months, I've been awakened.  And I've been doing my research.  And again, they were never going to revalue the currency.  There was no economic reset planned by the elite.  They had their own reset, which they were going to control.  everybody else.  And because of the current president of the United States, and that's why it's important that you have to support The red wave as much as you can.  And that's why it was important this last election to support the red and take the red pill.  I don't care if you disagree with our current president.  I don't care if you think of anything because God can use anybody, saved or unsaved, to do what needs to be done.  And biblically, it's been proven.  Like I said, what I was saying is, where did all the money go?  I'm looking here.  And it's because I watched a video on YouTube and it dealt with all this money in Iraq.  that's missing.  You know, at least $9 billion has gone missing.  Allegations of misappropriations related to the Iraq war.  $9 billion has gone missing.  Okay.  Investigation into missing Iraqi cash ended up in Lebanon bunker.  And here's the big one.  New York Fed's $40 billion Iraqi money trail.  Okay, here, corruption in Iraq.  Estimates of how much missing vary from 100 billion lost.  Iraq's hunting 17 billion missing after U.S.  invasion.  We spent trillions.  The United States spent trillions of dollars of taxpayer money for Iraq.  Yet, over 100 billion?  Trust me, it's got to be more than that.  But something has happened.  Because the money that is an Iraqi dinar investor, if you look at all the people all around the world who's invested, and all the other governments who have taken the Iraq dinar, and they just keep pumping and pumping and pumping.  They were stealing our money that we were investing.  There was never any attention by.  George W. Guy came after him, and most certainly the woman that was Allegedly, that was supposed to be the first female president.  They never would have done this because they had other plans.  And you're going to see that come out here in the next week.  In the next month, this country is going to go through some things.  And I pulled this article, Donald Trump supporters think president will make them rich if they buy Iraqi money.  And I was going back and I was looking at a prophecy by Prophetess Rosalyn.  And they dealt with Donald Trump and former Iraq Prime Minister Abadi.  And I was thinking that I truly believe that it's going to make this happen.  And it's not about the ratio, the cash flow and all this stuff, you know, about how much money is in circulation.  It's not about how much money is in circulation.  It's not about how many oil contracts they sign.  Because If a company that was on the stock market was doing all the deals and bringing in all the money through the currency auctions, through the contracts, through all the businesses and the reconstruction, oh yes, Iraq should have revalued a long time ago.  It's not about how much money, how much currency is out there.  This is about reparations.  for the Iraqi people and for those who invested into the Iraqi government.  This is about restoring Iraq through all the turmoil and the lies and the wars that were created on purpose.  Millions of Iraqi lives have been lost.  People call Saddam Hussein, you know, a bad dictator who's killing his own people.  Well, there's a lot of people that had countries that were a lot worse and would have killed you for a lot less.  And we already know that the whole Iraq war was a big, fat lie.  They've been taking our money, the money that we have invested, they've been taking the money from all these other countries and it's gone.  Do you think that the United States is the only country that has sent billions over?  I didn't even do the research on Europe sending money over or any other country sending over.  The current president is not going to give a bunch of corrupt individuals even more billions and billions and billions of dollars.  It's not going to happen, folks, until you see these mass arrests.  You're seeing gurus because they are following The Great Awakening.  And they think that the moment these mass arrests start, they think the moment that these things start happening, that it's going to happen right away.  So you're going to see it.  I've already seen it.  I've already looked today.  And they're already saying everything.  Oh, they're saying it's a go.  It's this.  It's that.  They're doing it to you again.  Now, of course, it could.  It could pop any time.  It could pop in the next minute from you hearing this.  But looking at this rationally, Folks, I have been awakened over the last couple months to what's going on, and there's so much evidence and so much proof.  If you don't see it, your awakening will not happen until it happens.  Folks, we're still, in my opinion, we're still far off.  The bankers, the ones that are currently in power, do you think that they can actually, you know, that the ones who have been pulling a lot of the strings of the United States, going into wars, those who are responsible, for the current crisis, the current economic crisis.  Capitalism works if you have honest people doing what they're supposed to be doing.  You've got all these people who go to school for 6, 8, 10 years to become an economist, and then yet, the economy.  Look, this is not about... If you look at United States debt, $22 trillion, you look at the world debt, global debt, according to this, Bloomberg Global debt of 244 trillion years record despite faster growth.  So here we are.  This is January 15th 2019.  They never intended on revaluing the dinar for those who?  The ones who were supposed to be in power over the United States right now.  They never intended on it.  They were going to pull this country down and And some of the things that I've been awakened to was pretty sickening.  This is not going to happen, folks, until these mass arrests start first.  It's going to put our country, it's going to divide, it's going to bring our country together.  It's going to divide some people because, you know, you're still going to have some people believe that this is all a dream, you know, and And a lot of people, you know, we call we have these great awakenings through through and we all think that it's all have to do with these mass evangelical movements.  And in the Bible, it says that that God will send a strong delusion that people will believe the lie.  We all think it's going to be aliens.  You know, some people think it's going to be this or that.  But what if we already were?  This Christian.  setup that we currently have mainstream Christianity.  you got the pope you know with all his a idols.  you changing the Lord's Prayer try to change the Bible may be doing that for years.  y'all don't see that they took the number books in the Bible down 66?  that's not a big enough clue for you about mainstream Christianity.  that they want to reduce things out of the Bible.  so you can't understand or see the truth.  Isn't that interesting how the Bible ended up with just 66 books?  Whose number is 6?  Well, they say man, but we also know who that other number is too.  They never intended... on revaluing.  This is going to be about restoration.  This is going to be about reparation.  This is going to be about restoring justice.  This is about getting the world back to where it should be.  And that's why these have to take place.  All the corrupt.  If you look at what's happening in North Korea, they're saying, oh, Kim Jong, he's just executing all these people.  No, he's clearing out the DS.  If you look at Australia and what's happening in Australia and all the figures and all the people that have resigned.  And if you look at what happened in Saudi Arabia, they cleaned house.  There is a lot of countries that are cleaning house.  And it has to happen.  And I think when we look at some of these prophecies by Kim Clement and everything, and we were just looking at them all wrong.  Prophecies come in parts.  And that's why you have to put all the pieces together.  Just like the Great Awakening.  You have to put all the pieces together.  Folks, it's going to happen.  But it's just not going to happen in the way that we had thought it was.  The current president will be the start of the global economic reset after those who are currently in power now in those important positions all over the world, all over the central banks.  Not going to happen until then.  Could.  They might get panicky.  You know, you throw trillions of dollars into the system.  It's going to be harder to track a lot of money.  It's going to be harder to track money.  I'm surprised they didn't do it already, to be honest with you.  With everything that's going on with our current president going after all these bad guys in the economic industry, in the central banking industry, you would have thought they would have.  Throw a whole bunch of money and you throw trillions of dollars into the system, you make a whole bunch of people wealthy, people are not going to care about anything else.  I think that was the mistake that they probably made after our current president was elected.  Like I said, folks, it's not about how many contracts they have, how much oil reserves they have, because they knew that already.  The contracts with all these companies, construction, cell phone, power, energy, just as about reparations and restoration to the world wiping out the global debt that was created by those who are about to be arrested.  It's a reset that is coming.  And if Trump and if our current president was never elected, folks, this was never going to happen.  That's why it is so important to support the red wave.  I don't care what your feelings are on social issues or whatever.  It's not about that.  Thank you guys for listening, and see you back soon. ",
