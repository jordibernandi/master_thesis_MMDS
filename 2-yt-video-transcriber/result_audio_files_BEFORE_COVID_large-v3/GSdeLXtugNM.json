The physical conditioning in the Forest Service, typical PT program at any of the station is involving hiking and running.  The packs get anywhere between 30 to 55 pounds of stuff and you're wearing that all day long when you're fighting a fire.  So just being conditioned to wear that in like a hot environment is part of it.  And then the fires, especially around here, they burn in some pretty rugged terrain.  Like fires burn uphill fast and so that's the job, it's an uphill job.  Under the United States Forest Service and fires specifically, you know, we have all these different facets, all these teams come together.  We have an initial attack with fire.  We send five engines, bulldozers, our aircraft, air tankers, helicopters, hot shot crews.  So all those pieces are spread out strategically through the forest and then they come together.

And then once the gas is gone, it's done.  So we do use prescribed fire to burn the forest.  And then now the forest is burned.  You have a refuge for fire.
