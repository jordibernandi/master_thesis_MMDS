So it's not as if this doctor was, as it were, a maverick going about spreading fear on his own account.  He was actually commissioned, obviously, by government to contribute to the risk assessment.  So it wasn't a gratuitous... opinion of his.  It was something that the government itself commissioned him to assist in.  It's now been thrown back in his face as if he went out on a limb by himself and in order to undermine government policy. ",
