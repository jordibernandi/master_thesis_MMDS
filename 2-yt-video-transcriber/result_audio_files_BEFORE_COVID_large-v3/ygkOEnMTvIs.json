He's been, uh, he's been getting upset at, uh, you know, comedians.  He was really upset at, uh, Michelle Wolf.  Uh, he claimed that he was more in tune to Donald Trump's personal beliefs, uh, especially if they pertain to Donald Trump, perhaps acting a little bit aggressively towards women.  Uh, whether that be the 22 or more than 22, I believe, women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual assault.  But the fact that Michelle Wolf is willing to joke about abortions is far more egregious.  It's far, far more telling of her character than Donald Trump, who... again may have admitted to sexually assaulting numerous women.  um and now there's this the whole joe rogan endorsing bernie sanders.  probably uh probably a bad look but still ben coming to his defense.  you know ben is a he's a man of principle.  he's saying that the leftists attack joe rogan for having offensive guests like ben shapiro.  oh so this this one's personal.
