            "text": "I'm not here to bait you.  Well, let me finish.  You're saying I'm asking you questions over and over, but you've told me four or five times I'm not doing anything illegal, so I guess it works both ways.  I would just hope that somebody could educate that officer too, that she can't order me out of a building because of somebody's feelings, they don't wanna be recorded.  Okay?  And so, you guys got business cards on you?  Yeah, can I get your name?  My name's Phil, I gave you my name.  Did you get his name?  I did not.  Phil, P-H-I-L.  What's your last name, Phil?  Oh, you don't need my last name.  You want our business card?  What's that?  You want our business card?  Can I have your information?  Are you saying you're going to refuse a business card if I don't give you my information?  Is that what you're saying?  In fact, I'll give you my business card, but can I have your information?  I gave you my name.  What's your last name, Phil?  Do you have any warrants for your arrest or anything?  Do you?  I'm asking you, do you have any warrants for your arrest?  Do you have a business card?  You think you're going to hem me up now?  Is that where you're going?  No, I'm not trying to get you in trouble.  Oh, no, you're asking me if I got warrants.  What is that?  Come on.  Thank you.  Joseph.  And you're the sergeant?  I'm the sergeant.  That's correct.  All right.  So I'm going to follow up with the supervisor.  What's the supervisor's name that I'm going to follow up on this?  Which office are you talking about?  Well, you said you have to go.  Protocol is you have to go to your supervisor.  Who is that that I'm going to follow up with?  I'll follow up with Captain Anderson.  Captain Anderson?  Mm-hmm.  A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  You know, I can tell.  I deal with law enforcement.  And unfortunately, I can tell that if you're the seasoned guy, I feel bad for these guys, man.  I really do.  And with that... Why would that be?  These are good guys.  No, that's what I'm saying.  You're not picking up.  If you're the seasoned guy, I feel bad for these guys because they're under you and you're training them.  And the way you're handling it now, very unprofessional.  Get a better leader.  Don't ask me if I got any warrants.  What's going on?  Just out here recording.  Is there any reason you're recording?  It's what I like to do.  Well, it is.  It's just kind of odd that you're out here recording a nuclear plant that's been shut down for several years.  Okay, well, you know, I'm an independent news journalist doing content for a story.  And I'm not creating any havoc on the street.  I'm out of the way.  I'm not doing anything to create any nefarious purpose or ill will.  I'm just out here recording.  It's all I'm doing.  Okay.  Do you have any identification with you, sir?  Yeah, there's no reason for me to ID, unless you can tell me that I've committed a crime, or I'm doing a crime, or you suspect me of doing one.  Nope, I don't.  Oh, okay.  Alright, I just tried to talk to a watch commander, but they said he was busy in a meeting.  Oh, yeah, there's two of us on.  The other one's busy.  Oh, okay.  How's it going?  It's okay.  I just kind of wanted to get some information about the facility and also kind of express a complaint.  I'd rather not give my name.  What's your name?  I'd rather not give my name.  Okay, you don't want to give your name to all the people you're going to post it to.  when you post this?  What's your birth date?  My birthday?  Yeah, what's your birthday?  Well, if I'm not going to give you my name, why don't I... What's your home address?  I'm not going to give you anything like that, man.  I asked you guys a business here.  I got you on camera trying to break into that door.  We're trying to break in?  Yeah.  Break in.  It says pull.  It says pull.  To open the door.  Don't get smart.  You don't get smart.  Do you usually come aggressive like that towards people?  What's that?  Are you usually aggressive like that towards people?  All the time.  Really?  Yes, sir.  I have to be.  No, no, no.  I have to make it safe.  That makes this a hostile environment.  You put our lives at risk the way you come at us like that.  I don't see how I did.  Really?  Yes, sir.  Really.  I don't see how I put your life at risk.  How long have you been working here?  You came at the wrong ones this time like that.  You don't come at us like that.  You work for us, man.  Got a quick question for you guys.  I got a quick question for you guys.  Is that how you guys set an example right there?  By parking the wrong way?  Because, I mean, we get tickets when we park like that, you know what I mean?  I mean, that's not setting the right example for you.  Everybody in the community.  Next time if you guys, I'm just saying, next time if you guys can, park them the right way, bro.  That's what I do.  Okay, but don't you think they should have a little privacy?  We're talking kids.  I don't see any kids.  I don't see any kids.  There are kids there, sir.  Huh?  There are kids there.  So are you giving me legal advice?  No, I'm just asking you to respect the privacy of these two children.  I respect them.  Okay, sir.  I respect everyone.  Do I look like a disrespectful person?  Are there invisible kids there that you can see?  that I can't?  Hey, you're dismissing, okay?  Since you want to have that attitude, you're dismissed.  First of all, I'm on federal property, so I'll do how I please.  No, but we're going to do how we please.  So you lied.  I just told you.  Why don't you turn your back to us?  Why don't you turn your back to us then?  Thank you, I appreciate it.  Now that I've been dismissed, thanks very much.  You know, hey, all we do is go out and get information, bro, and show the public, bro, you know what I'm saying?  Like, go inside and get pamphlets.  Like, we don't do that crazy stuff that this guy was thinking, man.  Get your head straight.  All right, get your head straight.  You guys are really welcome to film me, but I don't want you standing directly behind me, so if you could just move to the sides and finger away.  I'm taking one step away and you're going to take your coward ass and finish your job.  Hurry up.  Step farther away.  No, I took one step.  I'm going to take one more step.  I'm warning you right now.  I'm taking one more step and that's it, coward.  One.  That's it.  Go back to your job.  Go back to your fucking job.  Fucking coward.  Hey, you know McDonald's is hiring.  They hire soft people like you.  Soft little pussies like you.  Yeah, go work at McDonald's if you're scared of a camera.  Yeah, I should.  I'd be a way better officer than you.  Way better.  Way better.  Your job is to pull people over and ruin their lives.  Your job is to ruin people's lives.  That's all you're good for.  You take their vehicle, they can't make it to work, you ruin their life.  They fucking take their car, you tow it away.  Who makes money?  The city makes money.  The city makes the money off of all the revenue, all those tickets you write.  The city is making all the money.  So congratulations.  Fuck no, I don't want your job.  Fuck no, I don't like to ruin people's lives.  So fuck off.  Why?  Because I'm telling you.  Back up to the corner.  Will you arrest me?  Yes, I will.  Back up to the corner.  Dirty ass fucking pig.  You could get behind him and face me, pussy.  I am at the corner.  What are you going to arrest me for?  What are you going to arrest me for?  148.G.  You look that up.  Look up 148.G.  148.G.  148.G.  How you doing?  You guys haven't gotten to the property, right?  No.  Why?  Is that what they said?  No.  I just want to make sure that you don't.  Just to let you know that once you pass this, it's private property.  I'm going to stop you right there.  What's your name and badge number?  It's right there.  So make sure that you do not go in.  Wait, hold on.  Once you go in, we have told you not to go in there.  Now it will become trespassing.  Do you know it's right?  there is a huge family?  How many brothers do you have?  It's right there.  Because every cop that says it's right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's right there.  Is that your last name?  You see that and you see that.  Okay.  You're a smart ass.  9808.  Tell us.  I'm pretty sure this is not the first time you do this, right?  Okay, tell us.  I'm going to tell you something.  Tell us.  Get back to work.  Can you roll your window down for me, please?  I just wanted you to pull off the road at the next intersection.  I didn't want you to come all the way up to Pasco County.  Is this not the next intersection?  No, sir.  There's about five driveways you could have pulled into.  I thought you meant the intersection here.  I apologize.  I said the next intersection.  There was a community there you could have pulled into.  I pull people over all the time to pull in there.  There's an open field right there.  you could have pulled into.  There's a lot of, many places.  Just a misunderstanding, sir.  Okay.  I thought you meant this intersection.  Can you roll your window down for me?  Here you go.  Can you roll your window all the way down for me, please?  Why?  For officer safety.  Sir, I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm recording everything.  Okay.  Okay, here's my hands.  I'd like you to roll your window down, please.  Sir, I don't feel safe.  You don't feel safe?  I do not.  Would you like me to get another deputy so you have two law enforcement officers?  I'll feel less safe if there's two of you here.  How would you not feel safe with police officers here?  I could explain it, sir, but you're not going to believe me.  So here's my license, which I'm required to give you.  Here you go.  And here's my insurance, which I'm required to give you.  Sir, I'm not required to, by law.  Yes, you are, sir.  I am not.  I've been through this many times.  Please put your window down.  I don't feel safe.  So here's my hands, they're gonna be on the steering wheel.  I need your registration also.  Okay.  Why am I being stopped?  For speeding, sir.  You went right past me and you were going 65 miles an hour.  It's a 50 mile an hour speed limit.  Okay.  Here's everything I got.  Okay.  And here's my hands, okay?  Oh wait, here's a... Here's everything I got.  Here's all my paperwork.  I'd rather just remain silent.  From here on out.  I'm gonna remain silent from here on out.  Well, you need to tell me if this is your current address, though, if I ask you.  I'm not asking you to... Any questions about any crime, okay?  I'm still allowed to remain silent, sir.  I can remain silent at any time, sir.  I don't need to give you Miranda warnings.  I'm just simply getting your identification, which includes your current address and telephone number.  Sir, with all due respect, I've given you everything I'm required to give you.  By law.  I'm inquiring as to whether this is current or if you live somewhere else.  And I answered.  No, you didn't.  I did.  No, you said you weren't going to tell me.  I said I don't... Okay.  I'm gonna say this one more time.  I remain silent, I don't answer questions, and that's it.  Do what you have to do.  I've given you everything I'm legally obligated to do.  Do you have any firearms in the car, sir?  I don't answer questions.  No, you need to answer that question, sir.  I don't answer questions, sir.  Sir, do you have a firearm in your car?  I don't answer questions, sir.  Are you some sort of sovereign citizen or something?  No, I'm not, and that's defamation.  I'm sorry?  I'm asking you a question.  I'm not telling you.  No, sir.  I do not work for the police.  I do not work for the police.  No, I didn't ask you that.  Well, that's what a sovereign citizen is.  No, sir.  Yes, that's exactly what it is.  A sovereign citizen is somebody who doesn't think that law applies to them.  Sir, I've given you everything I'm required to give you by law.  What are you talking about?  You're just making stuff up now.  I've been polite.  I've been polite to you too, sir, and I've given you everything I'm required to give you by law, and I've done everything I'm required to do by law.  All right, I also need your telephone number.  All right, no.  Okay.  I'm not required.  All right, sir.  You can hold on to this because I don't need this.  I'll be back with you in two minutes. ",
