Now, what's interesting is she's actually on here opposite Andrew Gillum.  Okay, Andrew Gillum, if you recall, ran for governor of Florida.  He would seem to be a pretty good candidate.  I watched him in the debates, so I was actually kind of excited for him.  I think he was a Bernie fan, or he was picked by Bernie, but then he took a centrist turn at the end of his campaign for some reason.  I don't know why.  But he's going to end up doing some propaganda for the Joe Biden campaign here and anti-Bernie propaganda, which we'll talk about in a bit.  But there's going to be a pretty lengthy clip I'm going to show to you in its entirety.  But watch every bit of it.  You know, you have to.  It's amazing. ",

I mean, there was just a report out in Politico about a shady land deal involving his brother.  This goes back decades, including their relationships with a credit card processor in Delaware, et cetera, et cetera.  Those attacks for Democrats have been totally taken off the table because they don't want to give Donald Trump a talking point.

I would tell you, though, that second choice element is really important.  That 15 percent threshold is really important.  The other thing to keep an eye on is the fact that Elizabeth Warren in some of these polls has been slipping below the 15 percent viability threshold as well.  Her voters overwhelmingly prefer Bernie Sanders as the second choice.  So there's a lot of these dynamics that could play out.

I have to say overall I'm disappointed that Andrew Gillum is essentially taking the let me take a piss on the Bernie campaign side or stance.  Very disappointing to say the least.  So the first problem that I had there was... Andrew Gillum basically saying, oh, it would be rich if Trump brings up Biden's corruption because this is the most corrupt presidency of all time.  Yeah, dude, but we know that that's what he's going to do.  He did it back in 2016 as well.  And you may think, oh, well, it's different now because he was president.  That doesn't make any difference to his supporters.  You think that's going to change anything for his supporters?  And Crystal brought up a really cogent point there, a very crucial point at that, which is that we are re-litigating 2016.  We're just going to have a, not re-litigate, we're going to have a replay of 2016.  Okay, because Biden is taking the Hillary space and then Trump is going to be Trump.  Because Biden is corrupt as hell.  Zephyr Teachout wrote a piece breaking this down.  He was corrupt.  In the pocket of credit card companies, when he was a Delaware senator, he does his big fundraisers.  His first one in his election was with the Comcast exec.  He does them with fossil fuel execs,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.  It's literally nonstop.  And then you have clear corruption with his son, where his son is raking in $60K a month.  on that Ukrainian board and now he works on like a Chinese company or something like that.  Obviously, he's just getting paid because he's Joe Biden's son, okay?  And he also apparently has some other like issues and whatnot.  We won't get into that though.  But there's a lot of corruption going on with Joe Biden, absolutely no doubt.  And so Andrew Gillum was just pushing, well, it'd be rich because Trump, yeah, dude, we know that.  But people are not going to care, okay?  Because Trump, at least Trump, it's an anti-establishment line, whereas Biden doesn't do that.  Biden is literally the establishment, okay?  So his response is royally stupid there.  And then he says, you know, there's not going to be, and this is what he's doing.  It's just really crazy.  He's basically trying to damper the hopes for Bernie Sanders and this is exactly what you would expect CNN to do now.  luckily they have on crystal ball there to push back against it.  but the goal of CNN now essentially be like oh yeah Bernie's winning Iowa New Hampshire but oh look small delegate numbers.  it's not going to be that big of a deal.  relax Bernie surge isn't that big?  chill out don't panic.  it's all good for the Biden campaign.  that's what they're there to do.  okay that is what their goal is.  But, and so that's what Gillum's trying to say, but Crystal's there to basically be like, hey, look, the first two states are huge in terms of influencing the subsequent elections.  That's how it works.  You know, Obama had won those two and he just went on a roll and obviously he ended up doing well with black voters as well.  And then he brings up South Carolina.  Now South Carolina will not be that big of a deal.  Now hopefully he does well in South Carolina, but the thing about South Carolina is it was really detrimental to Bernie Sanders last time around because he lost South Carolina by like 47 points.  Whereas this time around, polls have him at down somewhere like 20 points or something like that.  And Tom Steyer is polling at 12% consistently in South Carolina for some reason.  And we know Tom Steyer really likes Bernie Sanders.  So will he drop out right before South Carolina and endorse Bernie Sanders?  I don't know.  I hope so.  Is that going to happen?  I'm not sure.  But the margins are nowhere near the same as they were last year because Bernie has more black support now and it's split more in the Democratic Party.  And so the polls have him down like 20, 27 points, somewhere around there.  So, and Biden will only get like 47, whereas Hillary beat him by like 47 points or 50 points or something like that.  So the margin isn't going to be nearly as big.  Now, I have been trying to say that I really hope that the Bernard Sanders campaign has a really concerted effort to court older voters as well as black voters.  And yes, Crystal is correct about the generational split.  It is true that in the 18 to 35 bracket, more black people support Bernie Sanders than they do Joe Biden.  Now, there was still a bit of a concerning number there.  of 18-35ers who support Joe.  I was like, wow, even this many?  But then once you get to the older brackets, virtually none of them support Bernie because they're the more conservative ones, they're the more establishment ones.  You're talking about a group of folks who are already not a fan of Bernie Sanders, and then you're just going to an even more small, even smaller group.  So old people don't like Bernie Sanders.  So then when you go to black older voters, it's like, oh yeah, well, they're not going to like him.  Well, no shit, obviously.  You know what I mean?  But I really hope he has some serious concerted effort to court African-American voters because they're crucial to the election, no doubt.  And so hopefully he'll keep making gains in South Carolina.  And then he brings up, you know, oh, it almost sounds like when Bill Maher says, I'm taking a good look at Amy Klobuchar.  I was like, what?  when he says the Bloomberg stuff.  Bloomberg's not going to do anything.  Bloomberg's not going to hit the threshold anywhere.  now there are thresholds of 15 percent in congressional districts but I don't think Bloomberg will hit 15 in many congressional districts but he's certainly not going to hit any 15 statewide.  so he's not going to do anything except he's probably just taking votes away from Joe Biden which is cool.  so go ahead keep doing that keep doing that whole thing.  also in Iowa Bernie may actually end up really demolishing because Tulsi and Yang, I think Tulsi's at like one or two points.  I honestly don't remember.  Yang is somewhere between three and five.  And so those numbers are going to end up, most of them are going to end up going to Bernie because the way it works, as they explained there in Iowa, in each precinct, if a candidate doesn't reach 15% in a precinct, then those people have to go somewhere else.  Remember Martin O'Malley?  when he dropped out all of him basically all of his support went to Bernie and That took Bernie from losing by like four points down to just losing by 0.2.  So imagine He already has a solid lead in some polls.  He's demolishing.  Imagine them taking Tulsi and Yang's percentage and giving it to Bernie as well.  That would be crazy.  now the good thing is is that Pete Buttigieg and those other guys Klobuchar are So Klobuchar, maybe not so much.  Definitely Buttigieg.  He's going to hit the threshold in a lot of precincts.  So a lot of that won't end up going to Joe Biden, which will be really good.  So hopefully he hits the viability just barely because then that will really benefit Bernie Sanders.  So I was looking really good for Bernie Sanders in conclusion on that one.  And then I also want to mention the Super Tuesday numbers.  He's doing really well on Super Tuesday.  He's only down 2% from an estimate that I read.  He's also just had a surge in Texas, which I'll be doing a video on soon, that will be dropping soon.  And he is doing well.  He's winning California.  He's doing well in Massachusetts, Utah, a lot of these states.  He's doing very well on Super Tuesday.  Um, and finally, last thing I want to talk about is Crystal Ball mentioning that Bernie Sanders having the momentum after Iowa and New Hampshire is massive.  Because again, I'm trying to explain to you guys, narrative is what determines everything.  Narrative is what determines everything.  So if the narrative, which is controlled by the media, right?  If the narrative is, hey look, it's the true narrative, okay?  Which is that Bernie Sanders is going to do extremely well because he's going to win Iowa and New Hampshire and then it's going to set into people's minds.  That's what really affects the outcome of the election because so many people watch outlets like CNN.  So all those people watching are like, holy smokes, Bernie actually has a chance to win.  Wow, I might actually vote for the guy or I will vote for the guy.  So shout out to Crystal Ball.  Did a really great job and thoroughly disappointed in Andrew Gillum. ",
