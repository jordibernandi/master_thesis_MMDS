If a strike's applied to a video, depending on which strike it is, here are some things that can happen.  The first strike bans you from uploading, doing live streams, making stories, custom thumbnails, or community posts for a week.  So it's basically a week's suspension from creation, which of course can have a direct financial impact.  The second strike's the same thing, but for two weeks.  And on the third strike, your channel is permanently deleted.  This is why YouTubers hate false flagging so much, Donnie.  It's not a joke, it's not something to be taken lightly, it's a serious attack against another YouTuber with no purpose other than to directly attack their channel and income.  Now obviously it's different when the flag's actually valid, and not just done out of retribution for hurt feelings.  There are some videos that really should be removed.  Not that many, but some.  But videos debunking arguments that you would rather were not debunked do not fall into that category.  When you do this stuff, you're lying to YouTube, telling them the videos are against the community guidelines, even though you know they're not, hoping YouTube won't look too closely, make a mistake, and delete them, and strike the channel anyway.  If you didn't realize this, fine, I forgive you for your ignorance this time, but this is a very important thing for you to understand going forward. ",

And when you flag a video for a guidelines violation that doesn't actually apply to it, you're falsely flagging it for review.  Hence false flag.  And when you try to organize people to target a particular video with many false flags, that's a false flagging campaign.  If you don't know what it is, why are you apologizing for doing it?  How can you be sincerely sorry for committing some offense that you don't even know what it is?  It's just more dishonesty from you.  Does it ever stop? ",

You started a false flagging campaign out of anger without taking the time to think it through.  You forgot about it because you make so much content.  You repeat internet rumors about blue-blooded alien lizard.  people overlords because it takes too long to write a script every day so you just talk off the top of your head.  It sounds like you're telling me your production schedule is causing some serious quality problems.  Surely there must be some way to balance these things a little better. ",
