            "text": "What's going on guys?  It's Josh with Accountability For All and today we're at the Essex Correctional Facility, Middleton Jail in Middleton, Massachusetts.  We're conducting a First Amendment audit and we're going to see if they respect our First Amendment right and if they uphold the constitutionally protected activity that they swore to defend when they became sheriff's deputies.  Let's take a look.  So we're going to check the dispatch center.  It's after hours.  It might not be open.  But if not, we're just going to take a peek around.  We're going to stay out of any unauthorized access points.  And we're going to see if everything's okay with them.  Don't see a reason why it shouldn't be okay with them.  Let's take a look.  According to my research, an audit has never been done here.  That doesn't mean this is the case.  It just means that's what my research tells me.  So the office was closed.  So we're just going to walk around and take a peek and we're not going to go in any unauthorized access points.  We're just going to check out the place.  And especially with what happened in Rhode Island, at the facility there where people are peacefully protesting and practicing their First Amendment right, a deputy, or a jail guard, corrections officer, actually drove through them, breaking someone's leg.  He's on administrative leave now, and they got extremely triggered by the camera.  So we're not coming here hoping for a problem.  We're coming here to make sure that these guys aren't doing the same thing, because if they are, they're going to do it to us.  All right, so that says authorized vehicles only.  We could walk by there because it's specifically talking about vehicles, but I'm not going to.  Oh, we got a sheriff's officer right there.  What's going on guys?  Not too bad, how are you?  Is the information center closed here?  Right now?  Right this way, thanks man.  Alright, so the information center is open.  Let's make sure we read the sign here.  All unauthorized cell phones will remain in vehicles.  We're not going to a visit, so let's see if that counts right now.  I mean, because it's my constitutional right.  So I will challenge that unconstitutional side.  And just be ready to pull out that recording should we need it.  Okay.  Here's the address.  No food, just... What's going on, man?  How are you?  Good, how are you doing?  Good, thanks.  How can I help you?  Just taking a peek around.  Just taking a peek around.  What do you do in this building here?  This is the lobby of the jail.  Okay, so is that like for visitors or where you do?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, so this is where the visits come from.  All right.  Could you back up a little bit, man?  You're invading my private space.  No.  What is your business here?  I don't answer questions.  Okay.  You need to leave.  This is private property.  So I'm going to give you a waffle order.  I just called.  Could you play that?  I called and spoke to your department and I asked if it was a private.  Well, I can play it for you right now.  Okay.  We asked before we came here today.  Okay.  So she puts her supervisor on the line.  Hold on.  I just want to make sure you understand because... ",
