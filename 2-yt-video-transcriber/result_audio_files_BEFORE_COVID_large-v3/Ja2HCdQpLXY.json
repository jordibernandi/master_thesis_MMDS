            "text": "Nick Fuentes, the man who puts Nazi in the phrase, I'm a little Nazi.  Now, he's become a bit of a celebrity du jour.  This is because he has started a schism between the right and the alt-right.  Now, normally, this is going to be something that we would revel and celebrate.  After all, he's fighting between him and Charlie Kirk, which is always great to see.  However, he is becoming more and more powerful as a result.  And as his power levels rise and the fact that he wears no masks at all, I mean, he's pretty much a literal Holocaust denier.  it behooves us to do some more research as to what his beliefs are.  After all, if he is someone purporting to be part of the master race, we should learn more about the master race and what exactly makes them up. ",

Okay, gonna have to disagree with you on that.  I find it hard to believe about the dinosaurs.  You know, look, Okay.  They say they got fossils.  I just find it very hard to believe.  Oh, like giant monsters, giant reptiles walking around the planet.  I'm the crazy one.  You know, they, they talk about the Bible and they're like, oh, you believe in like magic because you read the Bible.  It's like, oh, you believe in giant monsters.  Really?  I find it hard to believe.  I, oh, they say there's fossils.  I don't know how many fossils there are.  I'm not, I'm not appealing.  I'm a paleo conservative, not a paleontologist.  And I don't know how legit that is or not, but I find it really hard to believe that, oh, there's these giant man-eating... I guess they don't live with people, but there's these giant carnivorous lizards just eating things and... I don't know.  It seems like a stretch to me.  You know, and all these other prehistoric creatures.  You know, let's call all the BS out.  These giant fish and giant, giant, you know, insects and giant birds and giant everything.  What?  That's retarded.  That doesn't make any sense to me.  And how old is the Earth?  I don't know. ",

            "text": "Let's check out the 10 largest living birds in the world.  The wandering albatross.  Quite large.  8.3 to 11 feet.  The mute swan, also quite large.  Dalmatian pelicans.  Number one, yes, the ostrich.  The largest living bird in the world.  An adult ostrich weighs up to 150 kilograms and has a maximum height of six feet.  Giant birds roaming the earth.  Now, the sixth largest fish species.  Number six, the great white shark, 6.4 meters, 21 feet, giant fish.  Number five, the beluga, a sturgeon, 7.2 meters.  I mean, based on this picture, you can see it's quite large in size, quite large in size.  Number four, the greenland shark.  Number three, the basking shark, all sharks.  Number two, the giant oarfish.  And oh my, look at this, a giant creature.  Hmm.  I mean, this could be made up.  I'm not a paleo conservative, but I'm pretty sure that this could be doctored.  I mean, these could very well not exist.  Number one, the whale shark, the largest fish in the world.  And oh, there, for reference, this is a human, just so we can see the comparison between, you know, the fish itself and the human.  And yeah, giant monster.  I would describe this as a giant monster that exists now.  uh yeah we don't have to go thousands of years in the past it's it's real and it's alive today.  now there's different forms of creationism.  they take different incarnations and of course the one he's referencing here is called young earth creationism.  it's a form of creationism which holds as a certain tenant that the earth and its life forms were created in their present forms by supernatural acts of a deity between approximately six thousand and ten thousand years ago.  In its most widespread version, New York is based on the religious belief in the aneurysy of certain literal interpretations of the book Genesis.  And aneurysy is basically people... It's the act of believing that the Bible is literal and that it's infallible and that you should actually take it completely seriously.  That's what makes a lot of this interesting, because modern day... let's say theists or even people who are very devoutly Christian or Islamic or religious, typically don't still take the Bible literally for a number of reasons.  One, it would just make you appear as if you live in a cartoon to believe those kinds of things.  And two, it doesn't give you a lot of credibility if you're trying to have serious discussions that pertain to everyday life, especially because, you know, we're talking about a book that was written in a time when human beings didn't have an understanding of the germ theory of disease.  So, the fact that Nick Fuentes believes this is quite interesting, and again, goes back to our discussion of both him and the Master Race, and specifically when it comes to his discussion of how he's not a paleontologist.  It definitely was hearkening to the God of Gaps theory, in which that it doesn't matter how many fossils there are, well, I mean, he either doesn't believe that the fossils themselves exist, or he doesn't understand whether or not he or how many there are.  he can't quantify them regardless.  most people who don't believe in the fossil records or want to you know dispel the theories surrounding the evolution of life usually try to find holes missing in between the fossils themselves.  so we might have a certain fossil of a certain period you know that might be Cambrian for example and then all of a sudden we have a fossil from another period and we're missing the fossil that takes place between the evolution of those two creatures.  now it's pretty downright incredible, the number of fossils we currently have and have found, and the history that we can actually paint using them as a timeline is just downright astounding.
