            "text": "I wanted to knock this out of the way.  I've been wanting to react to this for a long time.  Now, this is a story of a Ukrainian girl and she married a country boy.  Yes, another country boy in China.  She's a little better than that Belarusian girl because there seems to be genuine love in this relationship.  So a lot of the problems come from Not the fact that she's taking advantage of him, but just culturally, there's some differences in how to be a parent and how to be a wife.  So let's explore and let's react.  They've mentioned this thing called which is something I've talked about before on my platform, but For those of you who never saw those videos talking about this, basically one of the secrets to why Chinese women stay a little younger, besides neotenous genes, is that after childbirth, they stay at home for a month.  So, one month.  They don't do anything.  They barely even get off the bed.  It's a very interesting counterintuitive thing, because if you mention staying at home for a month after birth to Western moms, they will say, but what about PPD, postpartum depression?  Basically, after you have a kid, your hormones are all out of whack, and it's very easy for a mother... with a newborn baby to get a little depressed for a little bit.  So the solution for a lot of Western moms is to go outside, go back to work, get moving again, sort of get your mind off motherhood for a little bit.  What science has shown is that the baby, it's growing lots of stem cells.  It's actually releasing stem cells into the mother to repair the mother.  So it's almost like thanking the mother for basically damaging her body to have the kid.  So if you stay at home for a month, don't do anything, you're basically allowing all those stem cells that the baby gave to the mother before the baby came out to fully heal or heal as much as possible.  The stem cells can, the mother.  So that month, that one month is super, super important.  And not only is it important, there's other things too.  For example, the diet is different.  5,000 years of Chinese history, they've found the right foods to feed the mother to help best repair and best stem cell growth throughout the body.  So it's like a dietary and a lifestyle kind of seclusion for a month.  But, of course, look how long it took me to explain this, especially when there's a language barrier, which the Ukrainian woman and the mother of the country boy has.  I wanted to explain to you guys why there's this concept of zuoyuezi.  And you guys can say I'm just trying to put justification into kind of cultural BS, but I think it's quite agreed upon that Chinese women don't age as quickly... as, let's say, white women or Hispanic women or Indian women, South Asian women.  Now, like I said, it could be neotenous genes.  It could be, at least compared to white people, Asian people have a little bit more melon in their skin.  Melon is the stuff in your skin that gives you the color, but it also protects you from UV rays.  So there's other confounds, but I think doing the one month of repair work after having the kid is super important for a mother's health. ",

            "text": "I'm very tired.  so why not wash the hair take a shower etc.  it's not that they don't want the mother to be clean during those one months.  it's they don't like temperature extremes.  temperature extremes are very harmful to the human body especially to a woman's body.  if you meet any chinese woman i'm gonna say korean and japanese women are the same probably malay basically any country that was influenced by china.  Women drink hot water, especially when they wake up, they drink hot water.  The reason is you want to keep your uterus, you want to keep your womb at around the same constant temperature.  It's really damaging to the body to be experiencing temperature extremes as a woman.  So because your body is so fragile after giving birth to a baby and you want the stem cells to do their full repair, you have to not experience something that's so damaging which is temperature extremes.  that's why so again there's probably a language barrier.  the mother of our country boy didn't explain that.  i don't think the country boy even could explain especially he's a country boy.  he probably doesn't know much science.  stem stuff like i pretend.  i know.  that's why you don't wash the hair.  even if you make sure the temperature is completely right in the shower you have to take off your clothes right.  that's subjecting your body to temperature fluctuations.  so sometimes nowadays in china especially as people get more and more busy what they start doing is they hire these special.  you can call them midwives but they're not really midwives because they're not helping you during the giving births part of it.  they're helping you after the giving birth for that one month.  and these like midwife-esque People, they cook, they take care, they clean the mother and the baby.  So that's another way to sort of curb the postpartum depression.  So the mother can kind of do her thing while this sort of midwife-esque person helps her for a month.  It's a very cool cultural thing that's been adapted into the 21st century. ",

Oh, I don't want to kill these poor cute animals.  I'm not going to eat your food.  That's so disrespectful.  I can explain all the previous stuff through cultural kind of differences, but this part angers me a little.  If I go to someone's house, okay, they didn't know that, let's say, I don't like a certain food and they cook it for me.  I'm not going to be like, I don't like it.  I'm not going to eat any of it.  I'll be like, oh, okay, I'll try some of it.  Maybe the context of this was that She already explained many times to her country boy husband and to the mother that she doesn't like killing animals.  She either doesn't eat meat or she eats minimal meat.  But I think you have to make special exceptions, especially in a more collectivist country like the country she's in, because you're... a visitor.  right and maybe one day god forbid they might give you citizenship but as of now you're still a visitor so you should probably do your best to try to obey the customs and the laws.  i'm not saying if the culture says eat dogs eat dogs but like if the culture eats a sheep don't be like.  oh my goodness you're evil if you kill a sheep and cook it.  for me especially to an older person that cares about you which this mother of the country boy obviously does.

            "text": "I think especially for people in the countryside, the concept of having a pet just as a pet is kind of a little foreign, right?  Everything has its utility, including dogs and cats.  Dogs will guard the house.  Dogs will eat up, you know, whatever.  They'll eat up.  They might protect your kids.  They might babysit your kids, which comes to worsen really bad situations.  You could eat the dog.  Everything has a purpose.  A cat in the countryside, the cat will eat the mice.  The cat will eat other critters.  The cat will eat snakes.  So the dogs and the cats, they run around everywhere.  They run around in the yard.  They run around around the house.  But they don't get on the bed, right, because it's dirty outside.  Even when my grandmother had a cat, my grandmother's from the countryside originally, but she lived in the city for many years.  Her cat would wander outside.  go all around the neighborhood and then come back and the cat was not allowed on the bed.  The cat was a house cat, but it was not a house cat like what you think of American house cats.  The cat was a cat that knew where its home was, but it wandered outside.  There's a functionalist reason why In the countryside, they don't let the cats around the kids, right?  The cats are everywhere, scratching things, getting into fights, eating up dirty stuff.  Cats are omnivores after all.  Cats can eat vegetables.  Cats can eat protein.  They can eat everything.  So cats are not clean, unlike what you think.  Cats look cute and everything, but they're not clean.  So you don't want to get that stuff on your kid.  Maybe a house cat, a cat in the city, where the cat's only at home, at least you control some of the germs.  he or she is exposed to.  But in the countryside, there's way too much dirt.  There's way too much everything.  I assume what our Ukrainian woman's doing is.  she probably does not allow this cat outside either.  So this is truly like a Western house cat.  It's interesting to see clashes because people just see animals differently in different cultures.  And now the thing is, China's getting very, very rich.  So in the city, many people just have animals for the sake of having a pet, right?  They treat the pet just like their sons or daughters.  But I've only started seeing that in the past sort of 20 years.  Before that, if you treated your dog or your cat as well as your kid, You're probably going to get laughed at.  It's like, who does this person think he or she is?  But there's an interesting culture clash.  So that's it, guys.  Kept this short, but I think I provided enough analysis for you guys to digest.  Analyzing culture is very fun.  That's why I do it on this channel.  First ever video on an airplane.  I mean, I've done videos on trains before, I think.  But this is my first video on an airplane.  So, shout out to China Southern.  Maybe you should give me free flights.  I'll do more like this.  All right, guys.  Leave your comments below.  And CCTV4, this is fair use, okay?  Do not try to take this down like you.  try to take down my Belarusian girl video.  Because if you do, I will fight you guys.  All right, again, shout out to China Southern.  China Southern, you should give me free tickets next time.  Bye-bye, guys. ",
