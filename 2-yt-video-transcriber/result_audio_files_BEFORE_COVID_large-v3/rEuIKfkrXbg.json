            "text": "This is the Dollimore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollimore.  As a nation, we have collectively witnessed the steady march of Donald Trump and his regressive policies.  It's been meandering in path, but certainly not an objective.  Other than trying to indiscriminately reverse each and every policy achievement to Barack Obama, Donald Trump has also set a course for himself that involves appealing to the devious whims of a cross-section of our country that is made up of the most prejudiced, hateful, and ignorant of all of us.  A newly politically emboldened cross-section that chants for the persecution of political opponents.  Screams with seething anger attacking the constitutionally protected free press.  A cross-section with little to zero political literacy which delights at Muslim bans.  ripping children from the arms of their mothers at the border, slashing of food stamp benefits for hundreds of thousands of poor kids, rolling back rights and protections and thus endangering millions of Americans in marginalized groups like those in the LGBTQ community, as well as countless, countless others.  For those of you who listen to my podcast, you know that for almost three years I have been optimistic that there would come a time when citizens who voted for Donald Trump would regret their choice, and as the ultimate act of contrition, vocally withdraw their support from him and his party of recalcitrance and division.  that there would come a time when decent people who were initially bamboozled by this hateful huckster-in-chief would see the error of their ways and come back into the fold of Americans who actually love their figurative neighbors and not just the ones who live literally next door.  Well, I think it is reasonable to believe that a case can be made for this to be occurring right now.  And if indeed it is, it will naturally have ramifications with elected officials, some of whom will ultimately have an actual vote as senators and jurors in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump.  Here's why I believe the tide may be turning.  Louisiana and Kentucky.  Both of these states in the past weeks have held statewide elections for governor.  Both of these states rejected the Republican candidate in favor of the Democrat.  And both of these states voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016.  Most recently, last week, Louisiana chose John Bel Edwards over Republican Eddie Rasponi, or as locals nicknamed him, Phony Rasponi.  You see, instead of running a race about Louisiana and the issue specific to Louisianans, Eddie Rasponi decided to wrap his arms around Donald Trump.  hitching his entire gubernatorial race to Trump's broken wagon.  He did the math and decided that Trump was so popular, he would carry himself to the governor's office solely on his coattails.  Both Trump and Rasponi counted on this flawed, flawed calculation.  So Trump took a look, so you gotta give me a big win, please, okay?  Okay?  Awesome. ",

            "text": "Thank you for being here.  Louisiana, we are Trump country.  We love President Trump, and he loves Louisiana.  Well, Phony Rasponi was wrong.  Not just wrong though, not governor either.  You see, Eddie Rasponi and Donald Trump were rejected by Louisiana.  There is clearly a fatigue related to Trump's undeniable penchant for corruption and self-dealing.  And John Bel Edwards was sent back to Baton Rouge by an almost three-point margin.  The other indicator I believe bolsters my theory that there is a sea change occurring in Trump country is what took place a couple of weeks ago in Kentucky, where a defiant and dickish Matt Bevin read from the same playbook as Rasponi.  Bevin tried to nationalize the statewide gubernatorial election, making it about Donald Trump.  Bevin explicitly made an effort to convince the people of Kentucky that a vote for him was a vote against the impeachment of Donald Trump. ",

            "text": "Do you see what I mean about defiant and dickish?  Yikes.  Well, listen, the voters of Kentucky rejected him, and by extension, Donald Trump.  They clearly weren't ready for four more years of Bevin, and by virtue of that rejection, there is clearly a weariness of Donald Trump's failures and constant barrage of scandal-driven headlines.  Now, Bevin lost to Democrat Andy Beshears by a far slimmer margin than John Bel Edwards in Louisiana.  Less than half a percent separated them.  But let's put that in context, a context which I believe only reinforces what I believe about the slow but steady evaporation of support for Donald Trump.  You see, to say that Donald Trump crushed Hillary Clinton in 2016 in Louisiana and Kentucky is a freakish understatement.  Donald Trump wiped the floor with Clinton in Louisiana, sweeping the state by almost 20 points.  That is a landslide.  For many reasons, both legitimate and illegitimate, the voters in the Pelican State chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.  And the results were even more stark and remarkable in Kentucky, where Donald Trump eviscerated Hillary Clinton by damn near 30 points.  30 points.  A 30-point margin of victory is the kind of win that indicates a voter mindset that doesn't reverse itself in a matter of months unless something is very, very wrong.  And we all know quite well that something is indeed very wrong in America right now.  Assuming the House of Representatives does the right thing and votes to forward articles of impeachment against Donald Trump to the Senate for trial, the country needs 20 Republicans to do the right thing.  We need 20 Republicans to put their country ahead of their party and vote to remove Donald Trump through the constitutionally outlined process of impeachment and removal.  And these recent gubernatorial results and these Trump stronghold states give me a glimmer of hope as to what is beginning to happen and to what we can possibly expect.  You see, trust me that Republican senators are paying very close attention to these elections.  They are seeing that Donald Trump doesn't hold the same sway with the voters that he once did.  I mean, if Trump-tied nationalized governor races are being lost in states which were won in 2016 by 20 and 30 points, what does that spell for states with Republican senators which Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 10 points?  Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas all went to Donald Trump by 9.4% margins or smaller.  And again, they all have one, and in most cases, two Republican senators.  And how nervous do you think Republican senators are feeling right now?  who represent states where Clinton won in 2016 and aren't going to flip red under any circumstance while Donald Trump is on the ballot?  States like Maine and Colorado.  There is a path forward for the impeachment and removal of Donald Trump.  Public opinion drives what these elected Republicans believe.  They aren't leaders or noble or statesmen driven by deeply held principles.  They are self-interested and care only about retaining the power they currently hold.  As soon as they see that the public opinion is shifting in a tidal wave against Donald Trump, they will flee like filthy rats off a sinking ship.  And rest assured that public opinion is shifting.  Yesterday, a new poll from ABC Ipsos revealed how Americans are feeling right now about Donald Trump and his possible impeachment after the first full week of public hearings in the House.  An overwhelming 70% of Americans think President Donald Trump's request to a foreign leader to investigate his political rival, which sits at the heart of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, was wrong, a new ABC News Ipsos poll finds.  Overall, 58% of Americans say they are following the hearings very closely or somewhat closely, 21 and 37% respectively.  And 21% say they made up their minds about impeachment after the first week of public hearings.  Among those who said this, 60% think that Trump should be impeached and removed from office.  of those following the house impeachment hearings very closely, 67% think Trump's actions were wrong and he should be impeached and removed from office.  So public opinion is shifting, especially when people are paying attention to the evidence that is being exposed in the course of the public impeachment hearings.  And again, Again, Republican senators are absolutely paying attention to this.  Look, we might not be there yet, and that's okay because the vote for removal of Donald Trump at the conclusion of his impending impeachment trial in the Senate isn't being held today.  And by the time it does take place, public opinion will surely have shifted even further in the direction of calling for his ouster.
