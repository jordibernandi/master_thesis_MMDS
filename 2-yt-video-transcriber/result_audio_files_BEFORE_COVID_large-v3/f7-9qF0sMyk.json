            "text": "The slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we've been waging in Syria.  Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011.  New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war.  Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist.  and all these different smears.  This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia.  completely despicable.  And I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like al-Qaeda in Syria, who've been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.  I'd like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in Syria, finally.  So really what you're saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having US troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time, to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security.  You would continue this policy of the US actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in Syria like al-Qaeda, HTS, al-Nusra, and others because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war.  That's really what you're saying.  As people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty.  They don't know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives.  And I agree with my friend Andrew Yang.  I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.  I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that.  The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have, but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can't forget that.  If impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country.  Unfortunately, this is what we've already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election.  And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016.  This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon.  I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal and rare?  I think she's correct.  We see how the consequences of laws that you're referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we've seen them as their past in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.  I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place.  I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.  It's not fair to ask These three about their health and their fitness to serve as president, but not every other one of us.  I am grateful to have been trained very well by the Army and do my best to stay in shape.  But here's the real question I believe you should be asking is, who is fit to serve as our commander in chief?  This is the most important responsibility that the president has.  What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him inviting the Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds show what an unfit president looks like.  It highlights how critical it is that we have a president and commander-in-chief who is ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security.  bringing the experience that I have, both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommittees related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee, the experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard.  I understand the importance of our national security.  I am prepared to do this job, to fulfill this responsibility as commander in chief on day one.  Thank you.  You know where I come from in Hawaii.  Many of you know we greet each other with aloha.  It's not a word that means hello and goodbye.  It actually means something much more powerful than that.  It means I come to you with respect.  and a recognition that we are all connected.  We are all brothers and sisters.  We are all God's children.  So I've developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially with Republicans like Trey Gowdy, for example.  He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues.  We've developed a friendship that's based on respect, and he's been there for me during some personally challenging times.  The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided.  Donald Trump must be defeated.  But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump.  We need to deliver a win for the American people.  We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected.  This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln.  who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.  When I look out at our country, I don't see deplorables.  I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect, even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly.  I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American, regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender, or political affiliation.  So I want to ask everyone to join me.  Join me in bringing about this government of, by, and for the people that serves all the people of this country.
