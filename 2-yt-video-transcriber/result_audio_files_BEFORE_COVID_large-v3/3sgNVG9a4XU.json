            "text": "Here's a question I want to ask.  I think we need to redefine the word tanky because, frankly, it now means, it literally means anyone who disagrees with someone.  I mean, that's just an insult.  It's like calling someone a retard or stupid.  Like, it just doesn't mean anything anymore.  So here's the way that I see the word tanky.  Now, from the beginning, obviously, it's someone who supported the tanks being sent in against the student revolt in Hungary in the 50s.  Not that they admitted that they were working with the CIA or anything, which they did.  But let's just say that's something that nobody even actually uses the word for anymore.  I would define tanky as someone who mindlessly celebrates... a socialist leader or leaders rather than actual Marxist theory.  Like when you are discussing an issue and they say, oh, Stalin did this, or everything is about celebrating a leader rather than actually carrying out theoretical discussion.  Somebody who's more interested in cheerleading a past leader than they are about, or a current leader for that matter, than discussing the actual theory behind what's going on.  And this can be mostly attributed to people who don't know very much at all, which is why they concentrate so much on celebrating leaders than discussing actual Marxist theory.  Now, that's my opinion of what a tankie is.  That's what I think the definition should be.  And I think that's one that a lot of people could agree with.  That would be fair.  So, you know what?  Let me know what you think.  Why don't you put a comment in the description.  Make a video reply saying what you think a tankie is.  Or what you think a tankie should be.  Because I think it's pretty clear by now that the actual definition... Now... no longer has any meaning as it can be just used for you know just about anything now and is frequently used as just a word to describe someone who disagrees with you the same way.  uh ultra left while ultra left is a real thing.  the term ultra left has now been used to disagree to describe someone who disagrees with a socialist country doing something that is anti-socialist.  it's just a way of dismissing their argument without actually addressing it.  And sometimes tanky can be used the same way, too, when you criticize someone.  Oh, you're a tanky.  I mean, come on.  We know that happens.  We know that happens all the time.  So anyway, let's have this discussion.  Let's discuss what should the word tanky mean?  What should the term actually entail?  Let me know in the comments section or even make a video yourself.
