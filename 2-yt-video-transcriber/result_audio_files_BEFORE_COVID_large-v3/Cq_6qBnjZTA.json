            "text": "We live in a complex world full of complex problems.  How do we prepare the next generation to solve them?  At Brown, we believe it requires a rigorous, innovative approach to education, an approach that is the open curriculum.  Instead of taking a prescribed set of general core requirements, the open curriculum makes students the architects of their own educational experience.  It gives students the freedom to tap into their own interests and shows them how studying different subjects develops different ways of learning, whether they want to explore many interests or delve deeply into the subject they love.  Brown students learn how to learn, how to question, how to solve, skills they'll need for life.  We give students tools, like the shopping period, a time when students can experience as many courses as they want to explore where their interests lie.  Since everyone is simultaneously going through this process, they can bounce ideas off one another and also get plenty of guidance from faculty and peer advisors.  Making these informed choices isn't easy, but through the process, students discover who they are and what feels meaningful to pursue.  This is a learning experience in itself.  By putting students in charge of their own education, our approach fosters a love for learning, collaboration, and continuous discovery.  With this freedom comes immense responsibility.  It's on each individual student to decide what their experience will be like at Brown and to find their purpose.  This makes the open curriculum as flexible as it is rigorous.  And it's been this way for more than 50 years.  Decades ago, engaged students called for a reimagined curriculum.  With faculty, they transformed Brown's philosophy of education in general to be more student-centered.  And a new curriculum was born.  But it's not only a way to think about education.  This approach is also action-oriented.  Each of our students can do research and engage in hands-on learning environments, collaborating with students and faculty in other concentrations.  Students at Brown become well-rounded, multifaceted people who understand different perspectives.  They then take everything they've learned in every area of interest and put it to use in the real world.  They become the kinds of people who tackle and solve the complex problems our world is facing today.  Visit brown.edu to learn more. ",
