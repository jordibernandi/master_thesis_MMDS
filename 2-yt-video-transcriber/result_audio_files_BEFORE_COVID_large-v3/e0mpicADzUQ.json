It's not true to say that none of the opposition took part in the election.  Some of them did and some of them recognised its fairness after all.  But to whinge about elections not being fair and to support as an alternative somebody who assumed a position who decided, couldn't be bothered standing in an election, comes along at the behest of their US puppet masters and says, do you know what?  I'll be president.  Well, Michael D. Higgins, the turnout in the presidential election in Ireland was 43%.  In Venezuela, it was 46%.  Do you think if I come along now and say, do you know what?  Michael D. doesn't have a mandate.  I'll be the president.  Do we want Donald Trump to come in here and support that?  over the heads of the irish people because where are the venezuelan people?  they're out on the streets in their millions saying yankee go home.  they're saying hands off venezuela.  They've seen it before.  They've seen it in Chile.  They've seen it in the interventions in Syria and so on.  And I am really sickened to the pit of my being about this one.  I think this is a... Game changer if this is allowed to go ahead.  I remember when we were elected here first and we came in here and I remember Lucinda Creighton standing there and telling us to support the initiative of our European pals in the bombing of Libya.  It was for democracy.  It was going to make things better for the Libyans.  Look at the state of that country now.  The amount of people who have been killed.  The society is a basket case.  It's in absolute disarray.  We've been to Iraq.  We've seen the aftermath of the slaughter of the intervention in Iraq.  We've been to Syria twice in the last number of years and have seen the outcome of the intervention there.  Will we please stop meddling in the business of other countries?  I noticed Niall didn't say anything about the Italians or the Greeks or... or the people who stood by the elected government of Venezuela and said, back off, they're not going to recognise the imposter Guaido.  Now, there are enormous problems in the Venezuelan economy.  There's enormous problems in our economy, but you know what?  The Venezuelans actually managed to build 2 million social houses last year, so they're doing, obviously, some things right.  But the cause of that problem... is the sanctions imposed by the West.  And we have the report by the recent UN Special Rapporteur, who's the first person to be in Venezuela in 21 years undertaking such a project.  And he is very, very clear about what he saw last year about the situation in Venezuela.  He said the sanctions are illegal.  They could amount to crimes against humanity under international law.  This is the former Secretary General of the UNHRC and an expert in international law.  It's the sanctions that are killing people.  It's the orchestrated sanctions that have put pressure on the economy, that have forced people to emigrate, that have caused a run on medicines and all of the economic problems that are there, as well as interference with the currency problems, orchestrated in order to weaken The leadership, an attempt that they failed to do under Chavez, now moving in under Maduro.  If we were truly neutral, we'd stand in Europe and say, back off, keep out, we should take a leave from the Greeks and the Italians and not slavishly follow the rest of it.  I think it's an absolutely appalling situation. ",

But in December 17 and January 18 there was talks between the government and opposition and the opposition insisted on the elections being held in early summer and the government caved in and agreed to them.  But then the opposition were warned by the Americans that they should boycott the elections, don't stand in them with other plans.  And they didn't, they boycotted the elections.  That's their idea of democracy.  I think we should put things in perspective.  Since Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 declared the US's right to exercise an international police power in Latin America, the US has intervened successfully over 40 times since in the elections in Latin America.  40 times in the elections in a 100 year period?  And we should acknowledge the role that a century of US-backed military coups, corporate plundering and neoliberal sapping of resources has played in the poverty, instability and violence that now drives people in Latin America towards Mexico and the United States border.  For decades, US policies of military intervention and economic neoliberalism have undermined democracy and stability in the region.  It is horrific what they have done to those lands.  In the Caribbean alone, they actually intervened physically 30 times in the first three decades of the 20th century.  They have wreaked havoc on this place.  And it's ghast to think that today, right, you have some serious instability here.  in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.  And because they've experienced a growing militarization and neoliberal policies through various initiatives, mostly sponsored by the US government and the US private sector, they've robbed so much of the land down there for banana plantation by companies owned by the Americans.  They have run millions of people out of their land in this region.  And a lot of them do end up on the Mexican and US border, trying to make a life somewhere else after the lives that they came from have been destroyed.  I mean, do people realize that on the 22nd of January, Mike Pence rang Juan Guaido.  The next day, Guaido appoints himself president of Venezuela.  So the US, who advised the opposition to boycott the election, they now want a coup to get rid of them.  What has that got to do with democracy?  Now, listen, Dwight T. Maduro is a wonderful fella and doing a great job in Venezuela.  No, I don't.  But you know what?  I think I'd leave it to the Venezuelans to get rid of him.  He's clearly only a shadow of the man that Chavez was.  But it should be up to the Venezuelans.  We should stop meddling.  We shouldn't promote other people meddling.  The Americans, who, by the way, for people that talk about democracy, I mean, the amount of countries and leaders and dictators that the Americans are popping up, do you know they actually supply military assistance to 73% of the world's dictators today?  73% of the world's dictators and they're worried about Maduro.  I'll tell you why they're worried about him.  Because they don't like the fact that he doesn't have an open door policy to American capitalism and financial imperialism.  That's why they don't like him. ",

The sanctions were designed to make the people suffer by depriving them of food and medicine and depriving the government of money to run the country.  That's what they were designed for.  And that's been ongoing since 2015.  And if Venezuela is in a difficult place today, they can thank US sanctions for doing so.  Yeah, what do we want?  Are we against everything?  No, we're not.  We're actually in favor of democracy.  And we think that people of Venezuela should decide their destiny, decide their future.  And they should pick their president.

Whatever the Americans decide on a certain morning, whoever they decide to back, well, that's all right, Jack, that's good enough for us.

The recent visit by the UN Special Rapporteur made the point that modern day economic sanctions and blockades are comparable with medieval sieges of towns with the intention of forcing them to surrender.  21st sanctions not to bring a town, this is to bring a sovereign country to its knees.

Difficulties and all.  And there are huge difficulties.  So what's the solution?  And what are we for?  Venezuelan society is incredibly divided.  Actually, you could say the opposition have been called, not exclusively, but in the main, it is in somewhat a revolt of the rich, but not exclusively.  The society is incredibly divided, so there has to be talks, there has to be negotiations, but in order to do that properly, the sanctions themselves have to be called off.
