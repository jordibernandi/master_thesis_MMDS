So you don't have to get cornered by that.  I never saw God creating the whole universe before, so I can't prove that there is a God.  Well, what do they believe in creating the universe then?

The mere fact that you can point the finger at somebody else does not suddenly mean that you yourself have absolved the skeletons in your closet.  Bouncing around and saying, what about you, doesn't solve anything.  Now, let's get to the other issues.  The issue with creationism is that, scientifically speaking, it does not have any predictive models.  There is no predictive capability behind creationism.  Whereas the theory of evolution and the theory of the Big Bang actually do have predictive qualities.  We can use the models presented to us by those theories, and we can accurately predict where certain things should be in the galaxy, or what particular fossils we should find in a geographical strata.  Creationism can't do this.  Let's also ignore for a second that he subtly implied there that evolution and the creation of the universe were somehow congruent. ",

I can't believe that when I shuffle a deck of cards, I drew a particular hand, but nonetheless, I happen to have a hand in my hand.  From that end result, we can then look back at the data available to us to determine whether or not we were justified in getting the end result that we did.  For instance, with the hand analogy, I can look into my deck and see if those five cards are missing.  If they are, then I already know the series of circumstances required to get my hand in the way that it is.  Much like with evolution, if I was trying to figure out why humans have a tailbone that's largely useless, I could then look at our ancestors and see if there were any of them that had tails that slowly atrophied over time.  And what do you know?  It turns out that's exactly what we find.  We have a vestigial tailbone.  Why?  Well, when we look back at the fossil evidence, it turns out that there are early ancestors of us that were quadrupeds, and the tail was very good at balancing them.  But very early on, in evolutionary terms, the tail was actually lost.  And this didn't specifically happen in human lineage.  All great apes have this same issue.  The only reason that we can look back through any of this data and determine this is because, well, unlike creationism, there is actually evidence of it. ",

If you haven't seen it already, I'll link it in the description, but the debate between Sean Carroll and William Lane Craig was one of the few times I can honestly say Billy Craig was smacked down completely.  You see, William Lane Craig tried approaching that debate from the side of a physicist, but William Lane Craig is not a physicist.  He is an apologist.  So during the course of the debate, he constantly had to use physics as an ad hoc rationalization for everything that he believed in, and then when Sean Carroll showed that his usage of physics was wrong, it left William Lane Craig backpedaling.  But onto the statement.  Let's go ahead and ignore whether or not that exact statement was said during that debate, and point out the reasons why this statement actually does have merit.  First of all, if you were to take the Bible as an example, then God didn't have any problem revealing himself to people for thousands of years.  This is something that he, arbitrarily now, decides not to do.  It's strange that the miracles like this stop when we start having the ability to record everything.  The other reason this ends up being important is because divine hiddenness is a huge issue for Christianity.  Whereas other polytheistic religions don't have this same problem, in Christianity, there is a God that is wanting to be sought out, that actively wants to have a relationship with his people.  But he also seems to be the root champion of playing hard to get, with a nice helping of hide-and-seek on top of it.  There's also the problem of any relationship with that god being necessarily a one-way relationship, or a one-sided one.  So even after that relationship has begun, there's no way to verify if that relationship even truly exists outside of the mind of the individual.  And because God has a will, and that will supposedly makes him want to have a relationship with us, it seems paradoxical that he is doing everything in his power to not have that.  As opposed to what we find in physics, where we have to seek things out because the things we're trying to find, like background radiation in space as an example, don't have the same will that a God would in trying to seek us out.  These are inanimate, non-thinking things that we have to discover.  Strangely, God is treated like one of these things, except, again, he has a mind and a will and a want for you to discover him.  Divine hiddenness is a problem, Kim.  You can't just say that that's dumb and walk away from it.  That may satisfy your head-nodding audience, but it won't satisfy me, and it won't satisfy mine.  Also, if you particularly have any rebuttals to this argument, then let me know in the comment section below. ",

Watches are not created.  Watches are manufactured.  They are assembled.  Usually when I use the term create, I mean bringing something out of nothing.  Creation in the way that only a deity would be able to manifest.  A human being cannot create anything.  We can assemble things.  We take pre-existing things like our synapses and our material world and we shape them into something tangible.  Creation ex nihilo is something that a god is supposed to be able to do, but something that normal people and matter cannot do.  So to compare your watch to the rest of the world is a category error.  Because assembly and creation are two separate categories, and you're trying to equivocate the two.  Your argument's not dumb because it's stupid.  Your argument's dumb because it can't stand on both legs, because the two legs are completely different lengths.  You try to favor the leg that says creation, but fall back on the one that says assembly.  But unfortunately, these two legs are not the same.  They don't function together the way that you think they do, and it's why your argument can't stand. ",

Granting a premise, say, God existing, isn't the same thing as accepting it full stop.  I can grant your premise and say that we have an all-good, all-loving God who also happens to be all-knowing and who is also all-powerful.  But then when I have a universe in front of me that seemingly has none of these traits, it is a very ruthless and cruel one based on consumption, I would then ask why God doesn't do anything.  I mean, he must know.  He's all-knowing.  And if he has any desires whatsoever, then they have to come to fruition because he's all-powerful.  So if I grant an all-good God that has the capacity to make an all-good universe and would desire an all-good universe, the evidence of a universe that is not that is evidence against that kind of God.
