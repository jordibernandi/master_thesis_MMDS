The guards would open the door and get the Zyklon all over their hand and die also.  How would that not happen?  Maybe there was a sub-door.  But he had another thing.  I don't want to pretend we're supposed to... He said when the Allied planes came over, they have pictures apparently of the smokestacks, and he said the smokestacks drop a shadow.  The smokestacks that we all know spewed out the sad remains of human souls that once had dreams and once loved.  He says, it's all a bunch of horse shit.  He tells me this big story about how the pictures from the planes on Dachau and stuff don't show enough.  The chimney is not long enough.  It doesn't cast a long shadow enough to have possibly been big enough to service the killing machine of Hitler.  That's what he told me.  I've been saying that for years.  Oh, okay.
