Need 65,000 donations to get on the debate stage.  She is less than 20,000 donations away.  Help her reach that goal.  Click on the link in the comment section.  It's going to be pinned to the top.  We need her valuable stances that I'm going to cover in this video at length because, well, apparently it's necessary because people don't know how to use Google or DuckDuckGo or Bing or their brains, for that matter.  And with that being said... Yeah.  You know, it's very, very, it's very rare in the independent progressive world.  I've had disagreements with other progressive journalists, you know, and we've managed to still keep a professional relationship because we all have the same goals.  There's nothing wrong with that.  We can have disagreements.  I encourage discourse.  I just had a debate with Teddy Fikre the other day about an article he did about David Sirota and Bree Jones.  Brianna Joy Gray.  I always want to say Gray Joy because I have the, you know, I'm so ready for Game of Thrones.  GLT!  Sorry.  But, and we can move on, right?  We can have a professional relationship because I know he's not acting in bad faith.  I know he doesn't have a hidden agenda.  It's just that sometimes we can be steered in the wrong direction one way or the other.  And I'm no different.  I can be wrong as well.  But it's getting to the point where I can honestly say I don't like Anna Kasparian.  I don't like her.  As in, I don't think she is good-intentioned nor genuine.  I question her integrity.  I question her objectivity.  And I even question her critical thinking abilities, honestly.  Because of things like this.  Take a look. ",

On foreign policy issues, she's not a progressive, but- No, that's also not fair.  Look, and you see that?  We have disagreements.  We do have disagreements.  Okay, and so I think-. ",
