I'm trying to do that.  I'm trying to say this with a straight face.  And I know you can't keep a straight face.  But I mean, responding to some pretty nasty calls like gas the Jews and see Kyle do Nazi salutes.  This was judged to have been a hate crime online.  You were taken to court.  You were found guilty of communicating a video which was grossly offensive.  You were fined.  You've appealed and appealed and got nowhere.  But this case became celebrated as a case about freedom of speech, the right to make jokes that other people don't find funny.  You had the likes of Ricky Gervais and David Baddiel, a prominent Jewish comedian, defending you, saying, look, this wasn't a hate crime.  This was something else entirely.
