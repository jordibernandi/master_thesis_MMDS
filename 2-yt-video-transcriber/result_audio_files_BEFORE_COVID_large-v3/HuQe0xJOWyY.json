Because the media pounded it into our heads constantly over and over.  And he was a young 24-year-old white man who didn't want to give up on Detroit.  He wanted to believe in Detroit and see it come back from the ashes and this and that.  And he was naive, and he believed that the inhabitants there could be civilized, and they didn't.  beat him to death.  And the media will not hold up his name.  You won't be remembering his name.  You won't have some weed-wearing witch on your show spouting out his name because white lives don't matter. ",

Oh, yeah, someone called in about it.  This is a 20-year-old guy by the name of Tyler Wingate from Berkeley was brutally beaten to death after seemingly minor car crash on Detroit West Side early morning, early Monday morning.  The crash and beating were caught on surveillance video from a nearby gas station.  Here's that sound bite. ",

Surveillance video from a nearby gas station showing the unidentified driver walking up to Tyler and clearly punching him in the face.  With several witnesses standing by, Tyler falling to the ground.  Much of the video too graphic to show as Tyler is seen at one moment trying to get up.  But the punches continue along with what appear to be kicks.  One witness able to pull the man off of Tyler and the man then even swinging at that witness.  All of them walking away.  as police say Tyler died right there on the ground. ",

No outcry, no protests, no rallies, no.  what do we want, justice, no justice, no peace, nothing.  Look what happened to that young white guy.  Allegedly killed by black guy or black guys.  Isn't that amazing?  Isn't that amazing?  And the people standing around were too afraid to do anything about it because the villains were black.  And black people, you need to know you're really creating your own destruction.  You're not going to get anywhere with this stuff.  And whites, at some point, you need to speak up before you get so angry you come out swinging in the wrong way.  And that's what the government want.  This guy, that's terrible.  It's absolutely terrible.  Detroit police said they have identified a suspect in this attack that occurred just before 2 a.m.  on Monday.  Lawrence James Davis said, 23 is being sought by police.  We have a picture of Lawrence.  See there?  Look at that, black people.  Black people.  No outcry, no nothing.  This is the guy that the police are seeking.  It's amazing, folks. ",
