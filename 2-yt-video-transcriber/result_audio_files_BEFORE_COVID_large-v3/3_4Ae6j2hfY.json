            "text": "Good afternoon and welcome to the Wednesday afternoon conference call with Trusts Unlimited.  This is Jim George speaking.  I'm the non-attorney spokesman and facilitator for Trusts Unlimited.  And I'd like to wish all of you a very happy new year.  Today's January 1st of the year 2020.  And I continue to believe that this is going to be the year for those of us that have been patiently holding these currencies.  Some of us for over a decade.  We still believe that there is a likelihood that there will be a reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar in January of this year.  Two weeks ago, the 18th of December, I said that there may not be a call today.  And frankly, I was not planning on having a call.  But because of the assault on the U.S.  Embassy in Iraq, I got a lot of e-mails and calls.  people very concerned about things falling apart in Iraq, so I thought that I should just go ahead and touch on that subject.  This is not going to be a regular call.  I will not be discussing the Trusts Unlimited program for denarians, and there certainly will be no Q&A, but I just want to touch on a little bit of what's going on in Iraq.  Those of you that may call in for the first time or listen to the replay, I would suggest you go to our call of December 18th because that's the call that has all of the information that you need about trusts unlimited services both pre and post RV.  so very quickly I want to talk about the situation that has developed in Iraq.  of course what's hit the news is the fact that the US Embassy was assaulted.  now the reason that the embassy was assaulted was because the Iranians had attacked sites where there were US contractors and one was killed.  And the United States responded with an appropriate military response and destroyed several of the Revolutionary Guard strongholds.  And of course the Iranians then assaulted the embassy.  Now, I don't think we should be too concerned in terms of the probability that Iran is going to seek serious military responses because when you think about it, what they've done here is pretty pathetic, actually.  They haven't confronted the U.S.  military head-on despite their bellicose language.  What they've done is hit soft targets, areas where U.S.  contractors are, and then, of course, the embassy.  Now, we need to discuss just briefly the history of what's going on here.  The assault on the U.S.  Embassy was led by a gentleman by the name of Hadi al-Amin.  Now, who is Hadi al-Amin?  Hadi al-Amin is a pro-Iranian sympathizer.  He's an Iraqi.  He was also a minister in the cabinet of Nouri al-Malaki, who, of course, was also a corrupt pro-Iranian Prime Minister of Iraq.  Now, what's interesting is, those of us that have had currencies for some length of time, that there was a very good chance for the Iraqi Dinar to reinstitute in early 2012.  But that got scuttled.  What's really interesting about this is that Nouri al-Malaki and Hadi al-Amin, a member of his cabinet, were guests of Barack Obama in the White House in late 2011.  So I personally have no problem whatsoever connecting the dots.  The Obama administration did not want to see the reemergence of Iraq and the reinstitution of their currency.  Why?  Because Barack Obama was elected, in his mind, on large part, because he said that the Iraq war was the wrong war.  And of course the reemergence of Iraq would, would contradict that position.  And second, the re-institution of the Iraqi dinar would result in anywhere from six to 8 million Americans becoming very wealthy individuals, individuals who most likely would not be voting for larger government, higher taxes.  So for these completely personal political reasons, the reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar in 2012 was scuttled.  And now, once again, we're in a position where the reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar can be accomplished, and the same people are trying to stop it.  The Iranians, the corrupt officials, Shia officials in Iraq, who not only want to scuttle this, but want to continue making substantial amounts of money through their skimming, the auctions, and through other nefarious means.  But I still continue to believe that the reinstitution of the dinar can happen in January of this year.  There's a lot happening.  The government of Iraq is moving quickly to resolve a lot of critical political issues.  They have committed to beginning the payments for the hydrocarbon law.  That's the payout of the oil revenues to the citizens.  Payments which cannot be made at the old rate, they need the reinstituted rate.  The new election law is passed.  The Sadrists have also publicly provided the names of three acceptable candidates for the new prime ministership.  Until that occurs, there is a caretaker government in place.  And they've said that the passage of the 2020 budget is their number one issue.  So all of this can be resolved.  Now, the Sadrists have also stated publicly that they oppose and do not want to see a war between the United States and Iraq, largely because they fear that that will be fought in Iraq.  The United States' position is very clear, though.  We've already doubled our military force in Iraq.  100 Marines were at the embassy within an hour of the protests, so there's going to be no Benghazis on Trump's watch.  But the Trump administration has made it clear, and the Iraqi government concedes and agrees that the only solution to resolving these issues is first to expel the Iranians from any further interference in Iraq, And second, by proceeding with the reinstitution of the currency, which will allow Iraq to deal with other nations to acquire what it needs and to no longer be a piggy bank for Iran.  Now, Iraq has been a piggy bank for Iran for over a decade.  But since the United States sanctions, Iraq has really coveted Iran because they need China and Iran together.  order to acquire the hard currency they need to circumvent US sanctions.  so despite the Iranian interference and again for those that have contacted me very upset about what's happened I can only state that in my view what the Iranians have done is utterly pathetic.  they are not once again confronting the US military head-on but they are trying through protests and where they've got infiltration.  They are trying to hit soft targets.  They are trying to pressure corrupt officials in Iraq.  But I don't think at the end of the day it's going to succeed.  And the reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar will mean that the Iranians' influence is officially dead.  And let's hope and pray that that occurs in January.  And again, I still continue to believe that will be the case.  So that's what I wanted to offer today.  And we do plan to have a call certainly next week.  Certainly, if something of a really dramatic nature were to happen between now and then, then I will, of course, try to have an emergency email go out and schedule an emergency conference call.  But failing that, we will be back next Wednesday.  noon Eastern, 9 a.m.  Pacific.  Once again, thanks for listening to the call, and a very happy new year to each and every one of you.  Bye-bye. ",
