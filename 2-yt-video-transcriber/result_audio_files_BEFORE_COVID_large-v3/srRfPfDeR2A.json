Actually, there is serious work on that topic.  So take Robert Gordon's book.  I forgot the exact title, but something like The Rise and Fall of the American Economy, something like that.  Very serious book by a fine economic historian who... partially overlaps with what Pinker says, but it's done seriously.  What he points out is that he says there was a special century, roughly 1870 to 1970, at which point there was very substantial progress made, and it showed up in health statistics, you know, longevity, quality of life, and so on.  Things like invention of indoor plumbing, which probably had a bigger impact on quality of life than all of medicine, you know.  And many other discoveries.  He says prior to 1870, things were, it was kind of flat.  You know, there wasn't much in the way of growth.  But at that period, there was huge growth.  And then starting in 1970, it started to decline.  Well, that's the neoliberal period.  That's why You see mortality increasing in the United States.  You don't walk around the streets and see people starving to death.  But the majority of the population are stagnated.  The real mill wages are lower than they were in the 60s.  Is that progress?
