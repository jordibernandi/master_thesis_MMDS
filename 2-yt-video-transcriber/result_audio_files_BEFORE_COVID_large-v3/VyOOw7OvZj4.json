            "text": "Hi friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor here.  I want to welcome you to our Friday evening Bible question of the week.  And today we're dealing with a question that frequently comes in where people are concerned, how do I know if I have committed the unpardonable sin?  Of course, just the concept that there is a sin for which there is no forgiveness can be troubling if people don't know what that is.  Let me read the verse.  that's the foundation for this.  And you find this in Matthew chapter 12.  I'll start with verse 31.  Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.  Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him.  But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or the age to come.  It's called the unpardonable sin, blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, the sin that cannot be forgiven.  Sometimes when people hear about a sin that cannot be forgiven, in their minds they try to conjure up the very worst sin that they can imagine.  They say, well, maybe it's homicide or infanticide, killing a child or being a serial killer.  What could it be?  Kidnapping.  What is the unpardonable sin?  And there's all kinds of sin that God forgives in the Bible.  that actually shocks us.  how merciful God is.  You find examples in the Bible of people like Nebuchadnezzar, who conquered Jerusalem, burnt the city, burnt the temple, carried the people away captive, killed thousands.  And in the last seven years of his life, he's converted and we expect to see him in heaven.  You have King Manasseh, who was a wicked king.  He killed the prophets, including the prophet Isaiah.  He offered child sacrifice as he made his children pass through the fire.  He reigned for 55 years.  But after he was carried away captive in Assyria, he repented.  He was convicted by the Holy Spirit.  He repented.  It says God heard his prayer.  He forgave him and brought him back to his kingdom.  And I can't think of too many individuals that have done things worse than Manasseh.  So what is the unpardonable sin?  Well, one thing is when you ever read a verse in the Bible, read it in its context.  What made Jesus say what he says here in Matthew?  You find a parallel verse in Mark, by the way.  He had been in a debate earlier in the chapter with the scribes and Pharisees, and they were saying in verse 24 of Matthew 12 that Jesus was casting out the devil by Beelzebub, the ruler of devils.  They were attributing the work of Christ in his spirit to the devil.  Now, very simply, if a person does not recognize and sense the working of the Holy Spirit in their life, What other mechanism does God have for bringing a person to repentance other than His Spirit?  It's the Holy Spirit that brings conviction, and it's the Holy Spirit that brings comfort.  Which leads me to another point.  When I talk about the unpardonable sin, there's two categories I'm thinking of.  One is a group of people who are a little too comfortable.  They're at risk of committing the unpardonable sin.  They need to be frightened awake a little bit.  And then there's the other group that they live in constant fear.  Their conscience is tormented that maybe they've gone too far and God won't forgive them.  They need to be consoled, encouraged, and comforted.  So I'll try to answer both of these extremes in dealing with it.  Some have wondered, is suicide the unpardonable sin?  Because in most cases, when a person commits suicide, they're at a point of they've lost hope.  They've lost faith.  The Bible says without faith, it's impossible to please God.  And one would think that if the last act of your life is self-murder and murders of sin, then how can you be forgiven?  Well, I've got to be careful.  There are a lot of people watching right now.  You know someone that maybe took their own life.  And it would be very discouraging for you to hear that there's no hope for them.  Some people commit suicide because of circumstances we don't understand.  They may have been Christians for years and because of a chemical imbalance or they're overwhelmed with some temporary discouragement and a moment of very bad judgment, they did something desperate.  You know, God knows the heart.  There is the story in the Bible of Samson.  who basically stretched out his arms and took his own life, really as a sacrifice to save God's people from their enemies.  But it was a suicide, technically.  I know a young lady that took some pills to commit suicide.  And then after she took them, she called for help and said, I don't want to die.  Please come and save me.  They sent the ambulance and she eventually became unconscious and died.  They could not save her.  We don't know what happened in her heart from the.  she made the choice to take her life.  She had a period of time she repented of what she had done.  So you can't judge.  But I also want to make it very clear if someone out.  there is thinking of suicide, that's a very dangerous thing.  If you think that you're going to improve your circumstances by suicide, in most cases, it permanently seals a bad situation.  Where there is life, there is hope, the Bible says in Ecclesiastes.  A living dog is better than a dead lion.  And for all the living, there is hope.  Make it through another day and God will help you out.  So what is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit?  Well, the word blasphemy, it comes from the Greek word blasphemeo.  It means to vilify, to speak impiously, to defame the reputation, nature, or work of God.  So when a person is rejecting the work of the Holy Spirit in their life.  Now let me give you an example.  It's kind of like when a person moves next door to the airport and they first find out that they got a house near the airport.  Every time a plane takes off and lands, it just shakes the whole house and it's very disruptive.  But, you know, after those people live there for a while, I've gone to visit people that live at the end of a runway.  And I said, boy, how do you stand it?  And they say, stand what?  I said, the jet's taking off overhead.  They said, oh, we don't even hear it anymore.  It's kind of like The teenager who gets to where they keep hitting the snooze button on the alarm clock.  that's supposed to wake them up and send them off to school.  And pretty soon they can get where they hit the snooze button and the alarm rings again and they don't even hear it.  I won't name them, but we had a kid in our house like that.  That everyone in the house heard the alarm, but they had trained themselves to not hear the alarm.  When the Holy Spirit brings conviction for our sin, we've got to be careful we are not grieving away the Holy Spirit.  Because, you know, the volume can gradually, and it doesn't happen overnight, but gradually over a period of time, if we continue to resist the conviction of the Holy Spirit, we'll find that we're in the church for 20 years and that sin that once convicted us, we still have the sin, but it doesn't bother us anymore.  We've grown comfortable with it.  Sort of like you get a callous on your heart and you don't feel conviction about wrong.  The Bible speaks of those who are saved in Ezekiel 9 as the ones who are sighing and crying for the sins that are done in Israel.  The Bible speaks of those who are saved as they close their eyes from seeing bloodshed and they stop their ears from hearing evil.  They hate sin.  But if you get so used to sin that it doesn't convict or bother you anymore, You can be in danger of grieving away the Holy Spirit.  Now, there's some characters we can look at in the Bible that are examples of committing the unpardonable sin.  You've got Judas, of course, who, you know, even after he could have been saved right up to the point where Jesus washed his feet.  But he hardened his heart.  And even when Christ said, one of you will betray me.  And Judas said, is it I?  And Christ said, thou hast said.  He should have confessed and repented right there.  But he hardened his heart through pride.  And the Bible says he went out.  Satan entered him.  At that point, he had reached the point of no return.  And he grieved away the Holy Spirit.  King Saul, when he finally refused to listen to the priests and the spirit.  And he ended up going to a witch.  Saul grieved away the Holy Spirit.  He fell on his sword.  Judas, of course, hung himself.  Balaam was a prophet of God, but he was so greedy for the gain that even when God spoke through him and said, I'm not going to curse the people I blessed, he kept trying to think of a way to get that money.  And so he concocted a way to trap the people of God in sin.  He grieved away the Holy Spirit and he was killed in a battle.  And, uh, You know, there's probably a number of other cases in the Bible of people that just, they went too far.  All the people who lived in the days of Noah, once the ark door was shut, Bible says life went on for seven more days, but everybody outside the ark had grieved away the Holy Spirit and they were all lost.  Their doom was sealed.  It's like when probation closes in the last days, there'll be a whole group of people in the world who have grieved away the Holy Spirit.  They've gone too far.  There's no redemption for them anymore.  And that's when Jesus declares in Revelation 22, He that is just, let him be just still.  He that is unjust, let him be unjust still.  The filthy remain filthy.  It's such a wonderful thing that God is so long-suffering to us.  That he is so full of mercy.  But we've got to be careful not to take advantage of that so that we grieve away the Holy Spirit.  When helicopter pilots are flying over the ocean to do a rescue, they've got something that they call the PNR, the point of no return.  They know they've only got so much gas to go out, do the rescue and get back.  And they've got a little buzzer, a timer that they set with their fuel gauge.  And as they take off over the ocean to go do their maneuver or perform the rescue, when this light comes on, the PNR light, point of no return, they have to turn around.  If they don't turn around then, they won't get back.  They're going to have to crash into the sea.  And there are some people that reach the point of no return because they just keep pushing away God and pushing away God until they do not hear the voice of the Holy Spirit anymore.  That's when a person has committed the unpardonable sin.  Most people who are calling and asking, Pastor Doug, I'm afraid I've committed the unpardonable sin, they generally have not, because it's the Holy Spirit that's troubling them and making them want to inquire.  So if a person is willing to pray and to seek after God and read spiritual things, you can read about Paul in the Bible.  He was killing Christians.  Paul says in 1 Timothy 1.13, Although I was formerly a blasphemer, he was resisting the Holy Spirit, a persecutor, an insolent man, I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.  In Romans 5, verse 20, it says, Moreover, the law entered that the offense might abound, for where sin abounds, God's grace abounds much more.  And in Isaiah, we're reminded, Come, let us reason together, says the Lord.  Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be white as snow.  Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good of the land.  But if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.  So what's the criteria for being forgiven?  You cannot indefinitely go on in known high-handed sin and find grace in the end.  God wants us to repent of our sins.  Repent means a change of mind, a sorrow for sin, and a willingness to turn away from it.  Isaiah goes on to say, chapter 55, verse 7, Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts.  It's a new way of living.  It's a new way of thinking.  Let him return to the Lord.  He will have mercy on him and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.  The promise is that if we confess our sins, that he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  Of course, part of confession says whoever confesses and forsakes his sin will have mercy.  And so, yeah, Pharaoh, he committed the unpardonable sin.  Even after all the evidence that God was with Moses, he still charged after the children of Israel off into the Red Sea and he was drowned.  And of course, as I mentioned, you have Judas and Balaam and King Saul, but there are people like Manasseh and David who was guilty of murder.  Peter who denied the Lord, the disciples who were arguing among themselves.  Remember in that verse where Jesus talks about the unpardonable sin, here's how he begins.  All manner of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven.  God says he forgives all manner of sin and blasphemy.  So just trust in the Lord.  Come to him.  The Bible promises there in John that whoever comes to me, I will in no wise cast out.  Now, there's a lot more I can say about this.  It's an important subject.  I wrote a book on it because we get questions on it so often.  We'll send you this book if you contact us at Amazing Facts.  It's called Beyond Mercy.  You can go to the Amazing Facts bookstore, find out more about that.  What is the unpardonable sin?  And did I commit it?  Beyond mercy.  We know you'll enjoy this.  God bless, friends.
