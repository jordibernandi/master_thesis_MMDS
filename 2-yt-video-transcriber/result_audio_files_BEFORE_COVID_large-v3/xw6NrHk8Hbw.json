            "text": "Bye.  Bye.  The other day I had a near-life experience.  Someone called to check on me, yeah, I'm serious.  Never thought that I'd be starting all over.  Never thought that I'd choose to be sober.  But here I am, on solid ground No sinkin' sand, it's time to give.  That's the plan, when it's over Then I'll land, for now it's time To fly, and know that every little thing's gonna be alright.  Just hold the light, hold the light.  Got a message and it said, recall to light.  Just hold the light, hold it bright.  Got a message and it read Go live your life.  It's not your time, you cannot stay.  You must go back for one more day Almost like you gotta die Just to be alive.  Now hold the light.  Never thought I'd be starting from scratch.  It's a journey, but there's always a catch.  Try to hold it, but it goes too fast.  I'm stuck in the moment, caught up in the past.  The best of times, the worst of mine.  It'll all pass, watch it go by.  A blink of the eye, my halftime flies.  So don't ask why.  Just know that every little thing's gonna be alright And hold the light.  Hold the light.  Got a message and it said Recalled to life.  Just hold the light Hold it bright Got a message in it read Go live your life.  It's not your time, you cannot stay.  You must go back for one more day.  Almost like you gotta die just to be alive.  We all have gifts.  You cannot open, but you can give.  Oh, love broken.  You are the rock.  You are the light.  You are the ripple in the night that affects mankind.  So please just try.  I'm on the outskirts of Taipei Starting to wonder if I went the right way.  Checked the forecast today, they said it might rain.  Only thing left about me is my right brain.  Funny thing, this morning fell out of bed Saw the whole world from my tent instead And I should probably just get back to work.  A real basic lesson from a complicated search.  Saw the people, some were young, some were old Doing what they should without being told.  Inspiration from such a simple sight.  And if they can do it, then maybe I can hold the light.  Hold the light.  Got a message and it said, recall to life.  Just hold the light.  Hold it bright.  Got a message in it read Go live your life.  It's not your time.  You cannot stay.  You must go back for one more day Almost like you gotta live Just to be alive.  Now hold the light.  Hold the light Yeah, hold the line.  Hold the line.  Yeah, hold the line.  Hold the line.  Got a message and it said Recalled to life.  Just hold the light.  Hold it bright.  Got a message and it read Go live your life.  It's not your time, you cannot stay.  You must go back for one more day Almost like you gotta die Just to be alive.  Now hold the light.  Hold the light Yeah, just hold the light.  Hold it wide And make every single day Your whole life.  Just hold the light. ",
