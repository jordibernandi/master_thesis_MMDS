            "text": "One more time.  The other day I had a near life experience.  Someone called to check on me.  Yeah, I'm serious.  Never thought that I'd be starting all over.  Never thought that I should still be sober.  But here I am.  On solid ground, no sinking sand.  It's time to give.  That's the plan.  When it's over, then I'll land.  For now it's time to fly.  And know that every little thing's gonna be all right.  Just hold the line.  Hold the line.  Got a message and it said, recall to life.  Just hold the light.  Hold it right.  Got a message and it read, go live your life.  It's not your time.  You cannot stay.  You must go back for one more day.  Almost like you gotta die.  Used to be alive, now hold the light.  Never thought I'd be starting from scratch.  It's a journey, but there's always a catch.  Try to hold it, but it goes too fast.  I'm stuck in the moment, caught up in the past.  The best of times, the worst of mine.  It'll all pass, watch it go by.  A blink of the eye, my halftime flies.  Don't ask why.  Just know that every little thing's gonna be all right.  And hold the light.  Hold the light.  Got a message instead.  You're called to fly.  Just hold the light.  Hold it bright.  Got a message in it red.  Go live your life.  It's nighttime, you cannot stay.  You must go back for one more day Almost like you gotta die Just to be alive.  We all have gifts You cannot open But you can give.  Hold on the broken.  You are the rock.  You are the light.  You are the ripple in the night that affects mankind.  So please just try.  I'm on the outskirts of my plane Starting to wonder if I'll pick the right lane.  Checked the forecast today, they said it might rain.  Only thing left about me is my right brain.  Funny thing, this morning fell out of bed Saw the whole world from my tent instead And I should probably just get back to work.  A real basic lesson from a complicated search.  Saw the people, some were young, some were old Doing what they should without being told.  Inspiration from such a simple sight.  And if they can do it, then maybe I can hold the light.  Hold the light.  Got a message in his head.  Recall to the light.  Just hold the light.  Hold it bright.  Got a message in a red.  Go live your life.  It's not your time, you cannot stay.  You must go back for one more day Almost like you gotta live just to be alive.  Now hold the line.  Hold the line.  Yeah, hold the line.  Hold the light.  Yeah.  Hold the light.  Hold the light.  Got a message in his head.  Recall to life.  Just hold the light.  Hold it bright.  Got a message in your head.  Go live your life.  It's not your time.  You cannot stay.  You must go back for one more day.  Almost like you gotta die just to be alive.  Now hold alive.  Hold alive.  Yeah, hold the line.  Hold it wide.  And make every single day your whole life.  Just hold the line. ",
