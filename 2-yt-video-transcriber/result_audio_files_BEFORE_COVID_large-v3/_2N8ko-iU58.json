            "text": "Hi, my name is Aaron and this is my show, Re-education.  And welcome.  I know that you're probably a bunch of new subscribers, so it's important for me to explain to you what this channel is about.  The very first thing that you need to know, and the most important thing, is that I don't want to be here.  I think that YouTube is a horrible, disgusting, depressing, deplorable place that's filled with the worst possible dregs of human existence.  It is a capitalist nightmare.  It's something that disincentivizes meritocracy and incentivizes nothing more than charity or nepotism.  And I think that that is damaging to absolutely every single belief that I hold.  I want it to be burned to the ground, or at very least broken apart, But unfortunately, I have no other choice but to be here because this is the only platform to do this.  I mean, at least in any real way.  I mean, I suppose I could create a podcast.  The only reason why I'm here is to give you a solution.  And I'm not just talking about giving you a bunch of mealy mouth bullshit that is not going to solve any problems.  What I'm talking about is actually giving you real world ways that you can solve capitalist problems.  I have many.  The first one being the most important.  And if you take anything away from this channel, I don't care if you subscribe.  I don't give a shit if you watch even half a second of one video.  What I do care about is you check out the link in the description.  That is the only reason why I'm here.  It will help us, in my estimation, get to a society that can actually work towards benefiting the people.  I want a system that incentivizes health and well-being and disincentivizes pain and suffering.  And that can only be achieved through anarcho-communism.  The other thing that I want to tell you is that I have been on this platform for many years and I have had subscribers come and go.  A lot of the time it's because I say something that's offensive or that they don't agree with.  I am going to do that again.  I always try to give people my unfiltered opinion and if that makes you upset or if it's something that you don't want to hear... Leave now.  When I'm saying things, I'm not saying them for the sake of the audience.  I'm saying them for the sake of the argument.  And that is, I think, what we all should be doing.  I encourage free speech and free discussion in every single one of my videos.  You will never be censored here because censorship is authoritarian and I am anti-authoritarian.  My goal is to present the strongest arguments possible to convince as many people as I can that the way the system is running right now is not working, it is broken, and there is a solution to fix it.  People constantly say that the system that we have is the best thing that we got and that there is nothing else that we can do to make it better.  The last thing I'm going to tell you is this channel promotes anarcho-communism and re-education on that matter.  That means anarcho, the abolishment of all unnecessary hierarchies, and communist, the worker control and ownership of the means of production.  If you want to discuss that, that's why I'm here.  If you want more information about it, please talk to me.  I am always free and available to answer any questions or concerns that you might have.  I hope that covers everything.  This is my show, Re-Education.  My name is Aaron.  Thanks for subscribing. ",
