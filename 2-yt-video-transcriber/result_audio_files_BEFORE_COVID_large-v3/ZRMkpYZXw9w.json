All right, well, you have a good day.  I appreciate the same.  No, thank you.  It means a lot being cooperative like that, because other people come up, they're aggressive when they're filming.  I'm like, look, I don't mind you filming.  The sergeant, hand, completely inbred and half retarded.  You know, I mean, look here.  We have pedestrians that are 10 yards away.  Neighbors, okay?  He's got every right to be there, but I'm just saying, he's not a member of the press.  He's not trying to document this to keep things transparent, accountable.  You know, that's my job.  And the whole purpose is to show you so you're aware that there's pieces of shit like Sergeant Hand who, he's got no business even being a hall monitor.  Sergeant Hand has a gun and a badge and some kind of sick personality where he thinks it's okay to try to handcuff innocent people and force them to do things that he has no lawful authority to even suggest.  And clearly he's getting off on it.  So it doesn't change anything for me to be over here as opposed to over there.  This is much deeper than what he's doing to me in front of my camera.  What is he doing to people when I'm not around and when my camera's not there?  Apparently some kind of YMCA adventure counselor or something.  Just in time for the summer if you need some free time.  Sign your kids up for a YMCA camp.  Now, I'm not suggesting that Brian Hand is committing any kind of crimes against children.  In fact, I took a look at his kids, even pictures of him and his girlfriend, his Facebook stuff, all that.  Far as I can tell, it looks like his girlfriend's probably of age.  But YMCA already has their own problems.  If you look at the search results on the internet, if he's gonna be a tyrant, be violating people's rights, his oath, the First Amendment of the Constitution, The very least he could do is remove that YMCA crap off of his LinkedIn profile because he's making them look bad.  And that's best case scenario.  Police are not held to any standard at all, despite the rumor of being held to a higher standard.  The entire Inglewood Police Department could take note because I'm tired of training these bitches one at a time.  And now the point of me writing out here twice... The whole point is to keep ignorant police officers from killing people that they don't need to kill.  All he did was put a piece of tape up over there.  that is absolutely useless.  It doesn't block the sidewalk or anyone else.  I can approach from either side and still be.  apparently what he thinks is in his business.  That wasn't intentional, though.  They just said on the radio that Daniel Solomon's on scene.  It shouldn't matter.  You have a good morning, officer.  I'll see you later.  You too.  It's 2019.  Explain to me how 19 years later, Sergeant Han is so fucking stupid, not only did he not learn from anyone else's mistakes, but apparently he's never even recognized any of his own.  They just got the suspect.  They just got the suspect.  He was under the house.  But now, look at this crime scene.  How stupid.  Every direction of it is open.  This is where they just took somebody into custody, right?  Good morning.  How are you today?  You know how one of your neighbors had a tent to fumigate their house?  Yeah.  Somebody actually did break into the house last night. ",
