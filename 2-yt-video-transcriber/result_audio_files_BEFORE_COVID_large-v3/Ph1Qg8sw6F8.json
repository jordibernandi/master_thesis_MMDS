            "text": "Okay, so another question about Judaism.  Okay, so one of the things that I've always wondered about is, I think one of the things that distinguishes Christianity from Judaism is that Judaism has an implicit emphasis on the salvation, on the salvific properties of the state.  And I don't think you see that in Christianity to the same degree.  So, I mean, because there's... Can you explain that a little further?  Well, there's the idea of Israel.  That's part of it.  And there's the idea of the Jewish nation as a people, right?  Whereas Christianity has this universalism that's built into it.  This is right.  Right, and so... ",

            "text": "Okay, so I've never been able to have this conversation with anyone because it's an unbelievably dangerous conversation.  But it seems to me that the advantage of Christianity is that it places the fundamental locale for salvation within the individual.  I mean, independently of whether it's... like, pushed off for reasons of mercy onto Christ, which is something else we didn't finish discussing.  One of Jung's points with regards to Christianity and Catholicism was that there was a merciful element to it because the burden that was placed on each person being the locus of redemption, let's say, was so heavy that it was unbearable.  And so that you needed an intermediary structure to, like, lift the load off you from time to time, which is what the Catholics do.  It's like, well, here's all the ways that I've failed.  That's okay.  You're fallible.  You're a fallible human being.  You don't have to be crushed into absolute dust by the fact that you're not everything you should be.  So, all right.  But anyways.  I think that's where Jewish guilt kicks in, if I'm not mistaken.  Well, and it's also, I think, to some degree where Protestant guilt kicks in because the Catholics have that out.  Right.  And you can be cynical about that, right?  Say, well, you sin your whole life and then on your deathbed you're converted.  It's like, well, that's all nonsense because you actually have to repent.  And so if you have a lifetime of sin, there's going to be a bit of hell.  That's right.  That's right.  But you can see the mercy in that Catholic approach because it gives you... like a reset in some sense, right?  You get to be washed.  The fact that you're not everything you could be is a terrible burden.  And if you're carrying that all the time, it can just crush you into nothingness. ",

            "text": "And obviously that's present in its earlier iteration in the sacrificial system in the temple, among Jews, or among the family.  Like I say, three times a day, you say a portion in the Shemot Aseret, in the silent prayer, in which you repent your sins.  And then we have a full day, right?  Yom Kippur is deliberately designed to do that and to try and wipe the slate clean and give you a fresh start.  But as far as the other question that you're asking about- Yeah, the state, the individual.  Right, so to me, it's less about the state per se, because when you're talking about the nation of Israel, Am Yisrael in the- actual biblical parlance, it's not talking about like a bordered state and incorporate salvation within that.  It's about the special responsibility of this group of people to spread light to the world, right?  That you're supposed to be in the, again, Hebrew phrase, I'm losing a lot of Hebrew today, but we're talking Bible, so we're okay.  is that you're supposed to be a mamlechet kohanim v'goi kadosh, meaning that you're supposed to be a nation of priests and a holy nation.  And so that idea was expanded by Christianity to all of humanity corporately.  Basically, this applies equally to all humans.  Now, what's interesting about Judaism is that Judaism actually has almost a two-track approach.  So if you are a Jew, then you have these responsibilities, these 613 mitzvot.  You are not barred from the afterlife or from decency if you're not a Jew.  So Judaism is only half exclusive in the sense that if you're a Jew, you're a Jew, and if you're not a Jew, we try to actually dissuade you from becoming one.  But if you are outside the Jewish nation, you have a share in the afterlife so long as you fulfill seven basic commandments, the commandments of Noah.  So there's a set of seven commandments that were given to Noah.  These are basic, basic things.  Don't steal, don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't eat the flesh of a living animal.  You have to create courts of justice.  These are all very, very basic laws.  And so what that means is that Judaism posits, Yoram Hazoni is a really interesting philosopher from Israel.  He has a new book out called The Case for Nationalism.  It's really interesting.  And basically the case that he makes is that the biblical Jewish view of where values should be embedded at the maximal level is a safer view than the universalist conception.  Because the universalist conception, that you have a set of values that applies equally to everyone across all times and cultures, actually leads to tyranny and cram-downs.  Meaning that his argument is that the threat of the 20th century was not a bunch of nationalisms that were embedding particular values.  It was certain nationalisms that wanted to become universalisms.  It was Germany wanting to be the Reich that ruled the entire world, or the USSR wanting to be a country that was able to apply communism across all times and all places.  So a certain level of particularism in how we apply basic rules, the seven laws of Noah in the biblical case or the Ten Commandments, you can have certain cultural differentiations, and that allows for group cohesion in a way that you can't with the great mass of humanity.

So the Jewish critique of the universalistic principle would be, yes, there are certain fundamental universal principles that we should all hold by, and those we don't.  hold, have to get by Jews and non-Jews alike, but how those are iterated.  They have to be iterated within a specific cultural structure.  Otherwise, what you end up with is people trying to cram down cultural hallmarks of those structures on everybody else.  And totalitarianism springs from the idea that I'm going to take my culture, which is different, not actually better, right?  Like we don't actually say that the 613 commandments are necessary for everyone.  They're not necessary for people who are not Jewish.  And to take that and say, okay, now everyone has to abide by those things would be a form of totalitarianism in a way that it is not.  when you say we have this particular set of values that is iterated to us in a particular way.

Maybe that would include both sides, is that there's a danger to claims of universalism, and that's that large-scale totalitarian utopianism.  And maybe you could criticize the universalism of Christianity as contributing to that from a conceptual perspective.  But maybe you could say the same thing about the concentration on the particular, on the side of the Jewish emphasis on the state, because there are obviously, pathologies of ethno nationalism and localization that also manifest themselves as Another kind of danger.  right it would be the danger of too much exclusion and the danger of not enough Exclusion.  right.  and so the issue is how you get the relationship between the individual and the particular correct.  Yeah Yeah, well, this is one of the things that I think the EU is really struggling with.  is because you know, I'm kind of oddly enough for someone who's a universalist, let's say I'm somewhat sympathetic to the claims of the nationalists in the European Union, because it seems to me that what they're complaining about is that as sovereign individuals, there have been levels of bureaucracy laid out in this huge overarching structure, the EU, ",

            "text": "And localism, by the way, with other human beings.  I mean, the fact is that if you didn't value your own child more than you valued the child of a stranger, this would probably make you a bad person.  We would actually consider you a bad person.  If I had the choice between saving my son and saving a random kid of the same age, and I said, I don't see any difference between these two things, this would make me a bad person.  So the idea of having societal bonds that are local in nature is one of the things that America got right in its original federal structure, is the idea of localism.  Localism is very important, as opposed to one set of rules for everybody, because we do have these variations, and those variations allow us to have the social fabric that's necessary.  This is actually where I mean, to bring it full circle.  back to the online stuff, the online world is a giant savanna.  It is just one huge plane, right?  There's no hierarchy in the online world.  And not only that, there are no pockets in the online world on Twitter.  It's just one huge plane.  That doesn't generate any feeling of community.  What generates a feeling of community is people who you actually have social ties with.  And those social ties are necessary.  Social fabric cannot exist for six billion or seven billion human beings.  Social fabric exists in your community.  Right.  And as large as that community can grow and there are limits to the growth of that community.  And maybe this is what both Christianity and Judaism have in common when it talks about the messianic era is there will be a time when that social fabric can, in fact, encompass everybody.
