            "text": "So, those of you guys who were unaware, Andrew Yang did appear on Jimmy Kimmel last night.  He was on for about 10 minutes, came on after Laura Dern.  I believe, actually, if I remember correctly, Laura Dern's son, or Laura Dern mentioned her son was interested in Andrew Yang.  Hey.  Now, anyway, what I actually want to talk about here is, and there was an article that was very interesting, because the actual thing, I could show clips, I just, NBC doesn't, or ABC doesn't typically like you showing clips.  late night show clips because they protect those.  But the interview with Jimmy Kimmel and Andrew Yang wasn't totally out of character.  It was the typical kind of dismissive, jerky, late night host appearance from Jimmy Kimmel.  However, there was a few things that were said that I think... Got some booze?  There's a... Daily Beast just actually happened to be interviewing him.  I believe it was Matt Wilstein, the senior writer.  He just happened to be backstage at Kimmel that night, and he was going to interview Yang after the Kimmel appearance.  I talk about his major movie with MSNBC in the headline, but we'll go through, and he mentions how 30 minutes before, the Yang gang and Yang roll up to the theater, yada, yada.  They go through.  We talk about all this stuff.  It gets really interesting when it comes down here, so... Since Kimmel seemed to be a bit dubious of Yang from the moment he sat down.  The host cracked jokes about robots coming to take our jobs and wondered why a non-politician believes he can become the 46th president of the United States.  Why go right for president?  Why not start with senator or representative, Kimmel said.  Yang argued automation is happening too fast for him to wait.  Robot trucks may be on our highways in five to ten years.  I thought biding my time trying to climb the ranks.  We just didn't have that kind of time.  Now, in the middle of it, like I said, a lot of people \u2013 and we'll get into kind of the reaction in a minute.  A lot of people thought that Kimmel was a bit rude and dismissive.  He kind of always is.  But he was actually rude and dismissive and kind of \u2013 I don't know if hostile is the word, but it was \u2013. ",

But anyway, he ended the interview by saying, I think you have some very interesting ideas.  I don't think you're going to be president, but who knows?  That was wild.  What they don't mention here is he says, I don't think you're going to be president.  Pause.  Booze from the crowd.  But who knows?  Maybe you will. ",

            "text": "I didn't think Trump was going to be president either and I think Yang actually mentions that.  so that was one thing.  now before we get into a little bit of the reaction a little bit deeper into some of the stuff that they were saying I want to get in really quickly because the interesting thing about having this reporter backstage we actually got Yang's kind of initial reaction to the interview.  so the interviewer goes on and says it wasn't exactly how Yang wanted the interview to end but at least it was over.  I feel great.  now Yang tells me in his dressing room I did my lift for the day.  I've done my lift of the day a national late night TV interview.  Yang seems to be tired and a bit distracted during a conversation as he watches a musical.  He perks up when he sees a supporter wearing a Yang 2020 shirt in the crowd, so that's good.  He notices, guys.  He does notice.  Asked if he thinks Kimmel is a bit dismissive.  in his final comments, Yang tells me, I didn't think much of it.  Right now, statistically, he's correct, though I think he's underestimating our chances.  The candidate, Yang, would go on to cite betting markets like Predict It, which currently places him at an 8% chance of becoming a Democrat nominee, right behind new entrant Michael Bloomberg at 11.  Dang, money's coming in on Bloomberg over Yang.  I didn't even know that.  Yeah, that was rough.  Anyway.  Yang says, that strikes me as the most accurate predictor you could find.  And if you think about sporting outcomes, how often do 5-10% outcomes happen in sports?  All the time.  He is correct.  So Jimmy can be right that I'm unlikely to be president, but it can also be right that I have a far higher chance than almost anyone else.  And far unlikelier things have happened.  Both correct.  And then he goes on to talk more about MSNBC and what MSNBC has been doing and the Yang Gang tweeting stuff.  So, interesting stuff.  he goes on and keeps talking.  When asked, Yang, why didn't you bring more of MSNBC?  So mainly gets into MSNBC after this.  However, I thought this was funny.  Why Yang didn't bring up his war in MSNBC to Kimmel's audience?  He says, I was happy to talk about it if it came up, but it didn't come up and I could see why he wouldn't want to bring it up.  I do wonder a little bit if there's a sense of Jimmy Kimmel's like, A little aside, me and Cardinal are guys, a comedian, and he used to dress up like a reporter and go do spoof interviews as a reporter.  And he noticed when people called him out for being a fake reporter, all the other reporters in the area would defend him because he's like one of them.  I wonder how much it was like with Jimmy Kimmel where he's like, hey, you know what?  MSNBC is one of us, okay?  They're one of the big media.  Well, I was amazed.  You don't come for them.  Now, you notice CNN was like, CNN's all ears.  Hey, come on, CNN.  Tell us why.  MSNBC's awful.  Maybe ABC's a little different.  I'm not going to get into conspiracy. ",

There was a little bit of... I saw some people specifically on Reddit talking about Andrew Yang's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel.  And I saw a lot of people in the comments because when I first watched it, like I said, I was like, ah, it's your typical kind of Jimmy Kimmel dismissive, ah, you're dumb, you're an idiot, what do you know?  kind of interview.  Yeah.  But I was going through some Reddit comments and again, Reddit comments aren't BL and all, but a lot of people were... Pretty happy with it.  You know, I think Jimmy was his usual self.  I don't know what the fuss was about.  Yang did great.  Keep it cool, Yang gang.  Chill out.  Only critique is he didn't mention examples of other jobs being automated the way.  I thought it was great.  Energy was fantastic.  Jimmy asked good, easy questions and he was able to get his policies across.  So I do want to highlight here that it's not like everyone's freaking out because something came across my Twitter feed.  I thought it was interesting.  And that was a message also posted on Reddit.  And it says, do not harass Jimmy Kimmel.  Word just came back.  And this is from before the interview even aired.  People are like, eh, I don't know.

But one thing that's interesting is Andrew replies and says, well, no, because I have a lot of people endorsing me.  Elon Musk, he mentions a few other people.  And Jimmy Kimmel's like, well, is Elon Musk even an American?  Even Andrew didn't push back.  Someone corrected us in our comments on this.  I just want to point out, Elon Musk is an American citizen for 17 years.  2002 he became an American citizen.  So I thought it was funny that neither Kimball nor Yang seemed to know on top of their head at the moment that no... Because I always get in trouble with that too.  where, for example, the only people I just know they're technically from Canada.  So I'll be like, I know they're popular in America, but I assume that maybe they just haven't become a citizen yet because they're still Canadian.  And every single time it's like, trust me, if you're wealthy and live in America, it's crazy how easy it is to become an American citizen when you're really rich.  It really is.  It's almost like... It's almost like, which at the same time, you show up to any country and say, hey, I'm really rich, can I be a citizen?  They always say yes, you'll pay taxes, right?  So, I mean, that's, I can't blame the government for saying, oh, you're going to pay taxes?  Cool, yeah, you can be a citizen.  But it's worth noting that both Yang and, I thought it was funny Yang didn't push back and go, well, actually Elon Musk's been an American citizen since anyone in America knew who he was.  Ah, true.  I mean, I wasn't very old then, but I don't think anyone in 1999 was like, is Elon Musk guy, really?  I mean, I don't know how old Elon even was then. ",

Kimball has a right to his opinion.  And the way we prove him wrong is at the ballot box.  He must resist the urge to become a mob at every slide.

I thought it was just Kimmel doing his kind of style and Andrew Yang.  It was a little staccato, to be honest with you.  I thought it was very like, OK, Jimmy, ask me a question.  I'll give you a short answer.  It took a little while for it to start feeling natural.  I very much liked Andrew Yang's opening where he said, oh, don't call me that.  I thought that Andrew Yang did a great job of not being a boring and passive politician.  So I actually think it was great.  I would give it an eight out of 10.  I would have given it an 8 out of 10.  I don't think it hurt anybody.  I don't think it necessarily helped anybody.  And I think it was great to see Jimmy Kimmel walk back his.  I don't think you'll be president because of the boos that he had in the audience.  And what happened to Jimmy Kimmel I think is very demonstrative of what's going to be happening to more and more people in their ivory towers.  MSNBC thought that they were sitting in an ivory tower.  That they had the blessing of the establishment and they were still the ones that were choosing who wins and who loses.  Until Andrew Yang said, enough, we don't need you.  And all of a sudden they're like, oh, wait a second.  oh wait, but we actually do need you.  We won't get views if you're not on our show.  And his rebellion against MSNBC is a prototype for what more people, whether they're celebrities or politicians or whoever, need to be doing against the media establishment because the media has been spoiled into thinking they're entitled to our attention.  When in reality, in the modern media sphere, Nobody is entitled.  You can always go elsewhere to get your information.  So MSNBC got a swift kick in the pants from Andrew Yang, and it looks like Andrew Yang is going to win that battle.  I think Jimmy Kimmel getting booed by his own audience that is used to being on his turf. ",

Yang's done Instagram Lives and stuff after the fact, but I don't know.  It is kind of interesting to see what his initial takeaways were after the interview.  One, and then two, I did see some kind of a little bit of divided... There were some people that were very upset, but it did seem overwhelmingly like the Yang gang was more like, eh, it's Jimmy Kimmel, it's what he does.  So I just thought it was worth noting.  there were some initial people who were very upset that it happened, but... Overall, it seems to most people have agreed to be a pretty good interview for Jimmy.  A good interview for Yang.  Jimmy was just being Jimmy.  But I thought it was funny to... I thought it was not funny, but it was worth talking about exactly kind of what they were talking about.  Why, if you heard it was a bad interview, why people thought it was bad.  If you heard it wasn't bad, why people didn't think it was bad.  And I didn't think it was funny when Jimmy Kimmel... When Andrew Yang said, I'm not a politician, he said, well, like, if you're someone who juggles, you'd be a juggler, right?  Like, if you're running for president, that'd make you, like, a politician, right?  I thought that was kind of funny. ",
