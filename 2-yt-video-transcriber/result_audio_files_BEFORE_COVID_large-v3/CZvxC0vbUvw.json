And then I'll see that the plant grows better when the light is more intense.  However, am I going to argue that the light is somehow magic and just by touching the plant makes it grow?  because that's what I'm manipulating?  Or do I understand that the light actually affects the plant via some sort of complex mechanism?  And if I do understand that, then maybe we might discover stuff like photosynthesis.  Maybe I can do an investigation where I put my foot on the accelerator of a car.  Right, there's a gas pedal here in America.  And I put my foot down on that, and the car goes faster.  Do I then assume that my foot is somehow, or the pedal, is somehow magically the cause of the car going faster?
