Oats are a grain high in anti-nutrients, inflammatory to the stomach.  If you ferment oats properly, which takes about two weeks, they break down and they're much easier to digest.  I've never seen a vegan do this.  This was something that the traditional Scottish settlements did.  Chia seeds, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds.  A lot of the time, vegans talk about seeds having omega-3 fatty acids, but the body cannot convert the plant form of omega-3 into the animal form EPA and DHA.  We have to obtain it directly from fish.  These seeds are also very high in anti-nutrients.  Out of all the foods there are, seeds are the highest in phytates and oxalates.  They damage the gut lining.  Goji berries, blueberries, maybe just some oxalates, but most importantly, the meal is devoid of animal nutrition.  Where are the vitamins?  Where are the easily available minerals and elements not in the presence of anti-nutrients?  Cinnamon, not too big of a deal.  Peanut butter, very high in insects, craving the bugs as most vegans do.  And then she had half a banana, of course, needs to make it somewhat sweet so she can choke it down. ",

I love to combine it with almonds, because when you eat your fruit with something that has fat in there, it helps you to like balance out your blood sugar.  Because sometimes when you just eat the fruit, it like spikes your blood sugar up, And then when it goes down, you get really hungry again.  Also, a little side note, I'm not a nutritionist.

The almonds, nuts have a high anti-nutrient content.  It's not going to digest efficiently.  It's going to take a while.

It's the... eggplant from the oven with feta and pomegranate seeds and it's something that I think I really like.  it also has some rice on the side so I'm super excited.  I hope Laurence is gonna like it too.  so everything is pre-measured what is great because sometimes I tend to cook way too much.  I feel like I have a whole family, but it's just for me and Lawrence.  So that's great.  And also they have this little paper where they say step by step how you have to make it.  So that makes it much easier.  So I can also make Lawrence do it, for example.  So I'm making little cuts in the eggplant.  But I think it's because you put the oil on there.  And we're going to mix the oil with the rust-ol-hanout and that makes the eggplant go really soft and nice.  Otherwise it gets really dry in the oven.  So I'm going to put some olive oil in here and then mix it with the seasoning that we got, rust-ol-hanout.  And that's what we're going to put over the eggplant.

And then the price is 6.99 per serving, so that's not bad either.  So yeah, I'm gonna let it cook now, wait for the eggplant, and then we're gonna wrap it up.  Okay, Laurens, if you go get the eggplant from the oven, Pretty, huh?  And now it's time for the toppings.  I think we're gonna add first some tahini sauce, then the pomegranate seeds, and not to forget the feta on top of the eggplant.  Then we're gonna put some of the rice on the plate, add some of our pumpkin and sunflower seeds, And then we garnish it with some mint.

The eggplant, brown rice, feta cheese, yogurt tahini, pomegranate mint, ras el hanout as well as more seeds.  So the overarching problem with these meals and this diet is the lack of animal foods, the lack of animal nutrition.  I wouldn't say the foods she's eating are super inflammatory.  In that last meal, tahini might be the worst thing throughout the whole day.  Eggplant nightshades can cause issues for some people.  High amount of seeds means a high amount of phytates and oxalates, but she's not consuming incredibly high amounts of seed oils, nut butters, omega-6 fatty acids.  There's no high presence of tofu or really poisoned vegan foods.  It's just she needs to eat more meat, fish, eggs, and dairy if she wants to get the vitamins that her body actually needs.
