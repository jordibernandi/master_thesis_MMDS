            "text": "During Hitler's reign, he controlled his citizens by requiring them to carry identification papers.  Is America heading down that same path?  I'm Robin Kinderman and you're watching JBS Straight Talk.  The Department of Homeland Security recently gave notice on their website, stating, Beginning October 1, 2020, every air traveler must present a Real ID compliant driver's license, state-issued enhanced driver's license, or other acceptable form of identification, such as a valid passport or U.S.  military ID, to fly within the United States.  Individuals who are unable to verify their identity will not be permitted to enter the Transportation Security Checkpoint and will not be allowed to fly.  What exactly is a Real ID, and can the federal government really enforce such a thing?  The Real ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005, based on the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission that the federal government set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses.  Over a decade later, America is witnessing the full implementation of the Real ID.  This identification card is more than just the average driver's license.  The average driver's license and IDs are issued by state governments, but this REAL ID compliant driver's license is mandated by the federal government Department of Homeland Security and then issued through state governments.  This REAL ID won't contain just the bare essentials to identify you and the class of vehicle you're qualified to operate, but it has the potential to include anything.  Then Congressman Ron Paul warned about this already in 2005.  In this bill, there are no limitations on the information that may be placed on this identification card.  There are minimum standards, but no maximum limitations.  And the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security can add anything it wants.  So if they would like to put on there the fact that you belong to a pro-gun group, it may well appear on your national ID card, because there may be an administration someday that might like to have that information.  If that isn't concerning enough, consider what the ACLU of Maryland foresees happening.  In time, real IDs could be required to vote, collect a Social Security check, access Medicaid, open a bank account, go to an Orioles game, or buy a gun.  The private sector could begin mandating a real ID to perform countless commercial and financial activities, such as renting a DVD or buying car insurance.  Real ID cards would become a necessity, making them de facto national IDs.  Think about that.  What happens when you have to have a federal ID that allows the government to know everything about you?  What this all boils down to is a massive erosion of state sovereignty, an invasion of privacy, and a limitation of our freedoms.  Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that the federal government shall be in charge of issuing any sort of personal identification.  We should be limiting the government, not the people.  This REAL ID Act makes it sound like we need this new form of identification for our safety.  Remember the words of Benjamin Franklin, those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.  In order to keep our government limited, our founders gave us the ability to nullify.  With our Article 6 booklet, you can find out how this can be done and why it's so important.  Purchase your copy today.  Links are in the description below.  Then, contact your state legislatures and urge them to introduce and pass legislation to nullify this Real ID Act.  If enough states stand their ground, this Real ID won't be a reality.  Until next time, take care and God bless.  Thank you. ",
