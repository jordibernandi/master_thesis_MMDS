Recently, my video work from up to over 10 years ago has been taken out of context to paint me as a racist, sexist, special needs hating homophobe, and I was attacked for using the words gay and retarded years ago.  That is disgusting!  You're embarrassing me!  So in this video, I want to be fully transparent about what exactly all the controversy is about and apologize face to face.  He's working on something right now.  I'm distracting him, but what are you working on, man?  It's ridiculous.  I'm actually working on something pretty cool.  It's me, a couple of clones.  I think it's going to be pretty awesome.  It's going to be a nice little short once it gets done.  Clones?  Yeah, clones.  Everybody knows you just cut the screen in half and you've got to... Real fancy trick.  Real clever.  Real clever.  No, I think it is.  It is.  It's a nice trick.  That's like the oldest trick in the book, man.  Yeah, but it's good.  It's solid.  Clones are gay.  What did you just say?  What's going on?  Did you, did you do that?  It's just a clone.  I thought you just said it was no pig wheels.  And you said they were gay.  How did you do this?  How did you do this?  You need to calm down.  Are you doing this?  Did you steal my semen or something?  Did I do what?  Yeah, that sounded totally gay to me.  Put a shirt on.  That is disgusting.  You're embarrassing me.  Hey, what the fuck's going on in here?  Who are you?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, I'm really sorry for saying clones are gay.  Look, it's okay.  I know that you didn't mean to offend anyone, Matt.  It's cool.  Yeah, but it was dumb and inappropriate.  Yeah, but to be fair, sometimes clones really are gay.  I have a dream to engage in sex... Nico, I love you, man, and I just want to apologize for being a racist. ",
