            "text": "And do you guys like traveling?  Yeah, I love traveling too and I was just in Florida Performing stand-up comedy and I have to tell you Florida is stuck in the 80s.  So I had to tell them you know stop smoking indoors Stop blaring Phil Collins And most of all, stop calling me Oriental Woman.  And start calling me Japanese Goddess.  Thank you.  My mother in Japan is also stuck in the 80s.  She told me, Yumi, I want you to remember this.  Behind every great man, there is a great woman.  I want you to find a nice Japanese man, become a great wife, and become a great mother.  I listened to her very carefully and said, screw that.  And I moved to Canada.  and became a stand-up comedian.  So I live in Vancouver now.  I love Vancouver.  Vancouver is a beautiful city, but nothing compared to Winnipeg.  But when I walk streets in Vancouver, lots of creepy white men come and ask me, Konnichiwa.  Do you wanna go for sushi sometime?  I think it's slightly racist.  Like 75% racist.  Well, let me explain.  For example, when I see an attractive, let's say, a Mexican guy, would I go and say, hola?  Do you want me to help you pay for the wall?  I wouldn't say that.  Because it's racist.  So maybe next time when I see a creepy white man comes to me, I would say, hey, you creepy white man.  with awkward social skills, with borderline autism, with halitosis and funky body smell.  Maybe you wanna go to Japan and try to teach English there.  Because that's what 75% of creepy white men do.  Bye. ",
