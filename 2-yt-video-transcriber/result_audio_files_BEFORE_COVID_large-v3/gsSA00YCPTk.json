Dan Harmon created Rick and Morty, but you may or may not know that he also created the Plot Embryo, hallowed be the universal pattern linked in our descriptions and our hearts, the story creation tool that he and all his writers use to craft every episode.  If you're new to me and my channel, you might not know that helping writers tell incredible stories using the Plot Embryo is actually my full-time job.  The plot embryo is a crazy powerful storytelling tool but it can be a little bit tricky to get the hang of in the beginning.  So let's break down an episode of Rick and Morty so that you can see how the plot embryo works in action.  And today we're going to analyse Total Rickall.  And as always, spoiler warning, the entire point of this video is to spoil the whole plot of this episode, so you've been warned. ",

And in the conflict zone, so the unfamiliar, we have the parasite quarantine.  And if we look at the internal quadrants, so this is where the theme of the story is housed, we have the before states, so we have the Smiths.  don't know who real family is.  And then we have the after, the realisation that real family have ugly memories of each other.  So the protagonist of this episode is really the entire family as a whole.  At plot point one, we have the backstory from a previous episode that Rick's carelessness infects the family with parasites.  We drop in on the family in their comfort zone at a family dinner. ",

If not, then how did he insinuate himself into the intro credits of this episode?  How did he appear spontaneously in this episode and create all of these apparently real memories with the family?  The end of this episode, rather than answering questions about Mr.  PBH, actually opens up more of them.  So how does this fit in with the structure of the episode?  There are a few clues throughout the episode, which foreshadow the fact that Mr.  PBH is not just a parasite like the others.  One, he's inserted retroactively into the intro sequence.  Number two, the fake memories that the parasites create can only be negative up until the point where the parasite arrives.  But in this memory, Mr.  PBH is there throughout all of it through the negative part with the family up until cousin Nikki arrives and it becomes positive.  Just pee your pants. ",

How did he end up in the family?  And why, later on, can he directly narrate to the audience, breaking the fourth wall?  Well, here's what Dan Harmon had to say on it in interview.  I'll give you another theory.  How about Mr.  Poopybutthole, just as where there's flies, there's spiders, wherever these parasites start blooming, Mr.  Poopybutthole is a different species who is more benign or more advanced.  He subsists on lives in the way that a hermit crab steals other shells.  Maybe Mr.  Poopybutthole takes advantage of the holes put in your memory and kind of burrows into those pre-existing holes.  So he shows up where these parasites are and he's more of a fourth dimensional phantom species that isn't bound by space and only appears in concentrations of temporal malfunction or misperception and breakdown.  Mr.  Poopybutthole is insinuating himself into the universe regardless of timeline and the same powers that allow him to do that allow him to directly talk with the audience.  So what does all this mean for the structure of the episode?  Does it mean that this episode doesn't have a proper ending or that it doesn't properly fit the plot embryo structure?  Well, no.  Not to me at least.  Mr PBH's storyline is part of its own running subplot rather than part of the main plot of the episode.  Dan has talked about the episodic nature of his work, about how he wants each episode to be fun and satisfying in its own right, even if you haven't seen the rest of the show.  But there are still serialized plot lines which connect between episodes and Mr.  PBH is a great example of that.  So Total Recall tells the complete story of the normal parasites and how the family deals with them, but also starts this new story of Mr.  PBH and his interactions with the family.  And that is how Total Recall's plot embryo works.  Now, of course, I don't have access to the original plot embryo that they used to create this episode, but this is my best interpretation, you might say, kind of reverse engineered from the finished episode.  Let me know in the comments which episode you would like to see broken down next.  Every episode of Rick and Morty really is a testament to the amazing creativity that's possible when telling stories using the plot embryo method.  That's why I personally love the show so much and why I've dedicated years of my life at this point to exploring the depths of the plot embryo and teaching what I've learned to others.  If you find yourself lost and floundering when it comes to trying to shape your own stories, then I created the Story Magic Academy for you.  In it, I share my complete system to generate that first seed of a story idea and turn it all the way into a complete plot embryo.  ready to write.  In it I share all my best secrets and tips for getting the most out of the plot embryo framework and really making the story creation process clear, practical and gratifying.  So here's what to do next.  If you're watching this video pretty soon after I uploaded it then the enrolment for Story Magic Academy is open now.  so follow the link in the description below to join us before enrolment closes really soon.  If you're watching this sometime in the future, the Academy might already be in session, but you can still follow that same link to sign up to be notified the next time enrollment opens.  Okay, that's everything.  Don't forget to rate me five stars as your Uber driver and do the thing that everyone asks you to do at the end of every YouTube video.  And I will leave you with my favorite line from this episode.  Sorry, Jerry.  We're real. ",
