            "text": "Dualism is a philosophy which supports the idea that the world is divided into two realms, the mental and the physical.  The theory has been developed further into what is known as substance dualism, which holds the idea that the mind and the body are separate, they are two distinct entities.  Interesting, why do the dualists hold this view?  Let's look at it.  Firstly, if we think about the mind, we realise it is immaterial, it is non-spatial and indivisible.  It is conscious, it experiences thoughts, feelings, desires and emotions.  Now these are private and non-observable to anyone other than the individual.  whereas the body is a distinct material substance it is physical it is spatially extended.  it occupies space in a material world.  as these two are so different they must be two separate entities.  however Descartes argued that even though the two are separate the mind does in fact affect the body.  I see the mind and body interact through the senses the body perceives and the mind can control the body causing it to move when the individual wants.  So why should anyone adopt the dualist position?  Well it provides a good account for the mind-body relation.  Most people have a sort of intuition where they feel their mind is distinct from their body.  This theory reinforces that common notion.  But most importantly, we can tell that there are differences between the mind and body.  Your thoughts are not physical.  They do not occupy space or weight unlike your body.  So why shouldn't you believe that the two are separate?  Well, if the mind and body are separate, then how can the dualist explain how they interact?  How can something immaterial, which is not spatially located, interact and move and change that which is physical?  Good point.  Well, the dualist may in fact take... ",
