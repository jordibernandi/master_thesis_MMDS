            "text": "What's going on?  Luke from USA Carry here.  I'm back with another defensive gun use breakdown.  Today, this one is out of Wenatchee, Washington, where a shoplifting incident turned into a violent attack against a female clerk.  But then when it spilled outside, the assailant was confronted by an armed citizen who turned the tables.  Before we get started, if you're new to the channel, I do guns and gear reviews, defensive gun use breakdowns, and other concealed carry related content.  If you like that kind of stuff, hit the subscribe button below, and while you're down there, give us a like.  Now let's get to it.  All right, unfortunately there's no audio.  with this security footage, and just a quick warning, it does get a little graphic when the female clerk starts to get attacked.  So this footage picks up where this guy in the sunglasses and suspenders is reportedly trying to buy his alcohol with his ID.  Not sure how that works, but the clerk and him apparently talked for about four minutes.  We're picking up toward the end of that conversation.  So they're talking.  He's pointing at something, maybe the give a penny, take a penny dish.  Pretty sure that's not for people to buy beer with though.  So he starts picking up his things.  He grabs his six pack.  She rips it back.  He gets one and she decides she's gonna call the police.  He throws a piece of plastic at her from the bag.  They're going back and forth.  Looks like she's starting the camera on her phone and that's when it starts getting a little serious.  Throws the beer bottle at her.  So he starts to head outside, but then he decides he's gonna go after her.  That's where things take a turn.  So she's trying to video this in her left hand and call the police with her right hand.  And she's backing up.  I'm not sure if there's an exit or another room that way.  So he grabs her hair, starts dragging her out.  That's pretty scary, because at this point, she's not sure what he plans to do with her.  And when she gets to the end of the counter, she's resisting pretty good.  He's trying to drag her.  She's not letting him drag her out.  Then he knees her in the head and starts punching her.  hits her with one of the beer bottles, starts hitting her again.  And he picks up his other beer bottle.  And this is where the armed citizen drives up.  This is a Washington firefighter.  Now he's got two kids in the truck.  Just keep that in mind.  They're either coming back from or heading out to do a little jet skiing.  But things don't go as planned.  Now it does seem like she had a slight window to get out of there when he was walking to pick up her beer.  It took her a little bit of time to get up, but she needed to move and get out of that store when that window opened.  Unfortunately, he hits her again with the beer bottle and a couple more blows and then she gets out the door.  He picks up his beer.  Some other stuff, I guess he's forgetting his six pack or five pack.  And he heads out the door.  So now we go back to the security footage from the parking lot.  She comes into the frame on the right as he's going after her again.  Hits her two more times.  Looks like the guy in the truck has his windows down, so I'm pretty sure you can hear what's going on.  He starts to back up as if he's not sure what's going on here.  What did he just drive into?  Then he hits the brake and you see the driver's door opens up.  He doesn't have his gun in his hand at this point.  It's in his console, but it looks like he's given some kind of verbal command because the assailant stops while he's throwing a punch at the clerk.  And then the assailant starts walking around the side of his truck.  Remember, he's got two kids in the truck.  One's in the front passenger seat and the other one's in the back.  And he gets very close, way too close to the truck, especially too close to the kid.  That's where this armed citizen draws his gun.  If we zoom in and slow it down, it looks like you can see him draw the gun and then point it at the assailant.  Again, there's a kid in that passenger seat that he's pointing across.  But then he comes flying out the truck, probably telling the assailant to get on the ground while he's pointing his gun at him.  He gets pretty close to him, does a little arm drag takedown, but is still able to keep control of his handgun.  I would have liked to see him holster that gun before he did that.  so he's not waving a gun around, but we'll get to that later because he doesn't actually have a holster on him.  Then he takes his attention off the criminal for a few seconds, so you gotta watch out for that.  Then he spins around, gets his knee on him, he gets some pressure on him.  This guy was acting big and bad when he was beating up a female clerk.  Not so much now that he's got a bigger guy on top of him with a gun pointed at his face.  Then he tries to get away.  Remember how he kneed the clerk in the face?  Well, he's about to get a taste of his own medicine.  Pow, knee right to the face.  Sunglasses go flying, and that flattens him out.  Let's watch that again a few more times.  Now the video we got is sped up from here.  He holds the assailant down for about three minutes until police arrive.  Now let's go back and slow it down to see what happened to that pistol.  It took me a few times watching this to make it out, but you can see that the armed civilian hands the gun to the guy in the black so he can have two hands free to keep the assailant subdued.  That's right about when the police arrive on scene with a rifle.  The guy in a black shirt slowly sets down the gun as the officer is running up.  Looks like the officer's telling him to put the pistol on the ground and pointing.  Good guy looks to be pointing at his gun, maybe saying, I'm not armed, there's my gun.  The assailant must be struggling because then the police officer gets his knee onto him and looks like he responds on his radio and then another unit rolls up.  All right, after watching this video a few times, I came up with nine takeaways from this incident.  Number one, is a six pack of beer worth getting into a confrontation over?  I know some people will say, well, if you let them shoplift once, they're gonna do it again.  But what is the store's policy regarding shoplifting?  If they have a no-contact, no-apprehension policy, then you need to let go of your ego and your pride and let them go.  In the end, is it really worth the risk over a six-pack of beer?  Especially if you're unprepared or untrained to deal with shoplifters, or in this case, shoplifter-turned-assailant.  Because as you just saw, once this turned violent, the clerk was completely unprepared to deal with him.  There's loss prevention agents that deal with shoplifters day in and day out, mostly at bigger box stores, but they're trained for dealing with and apprehending shoplifters.  And sometimes they don't even go after them.  Another thing is they didn't steal your stuff unless you're the owner.  While I'm sure it's frustrating to watch somebody you know just stole something and walk out the front door, again, they didn't steal it from you.  There's a chance that the store has insurance to cover the loss of stolen goods or they can claim it on their taxes as a deduction.  So this makes confronting and trying to stop a shoplifter even less worth it.  Number two, learn some self-defense skills.  Hand-to-hand, grappling.  I'd recommend finding a jiu-jitsu gym near you.  A lot of them will let you try it out for free.  But even taking a self-defense course is a step in the right direction.  The owner of my gym, Vita Jiu-Jitsu, did a weekend class for females just to show them some hand-to-hand skills.  So I sent my wife so maybe she would learn a few things or maybe she would get the bug for jiu-jitsu, which she didn't.  The only thing is, just like everything else, if you don't use it, you lose it.  We often forget what we learned unless we practice it and reinforce what we learned.  And that's why I consistently train jiu-jitsu.  A normal week for me is about four or five days of training during lunch.  I'm sure this isn't the first or the last time you'll hear me talking about jiu-jitsu, so just get used to it.  And you'll also learn some takedown skills like we saw used in this video.  They might not be the most fun thing to do because you're getting slammed on the ground over and over, but we do train them in every class.  And this guy did a good job of taking the assailant to the ground, although he was waving his pistol around, but he did get him to the ground to subdue him.  Number three, we talked about this earlier, but escape when you can.  She had a brief window to where she could get up and get out the front door, but she didn't move and that put her in the position to get attacked again.  So if you see an opening where you can safely remove yourself from the situation, do it, get out of there.  Number four, never let the muzzle cover anything you're not willing to destroy, right?  Well, when he was taking that guy down, he was waving that gun around.  He might've pointed it at his truck where the kids were.  And then at another point, he's pointing at something with his gun.  I don't know what he was pointing at, but you shouldn't be pointing at things with your gun, obviously.  So if you're using one hand to hold a guy down, you need to be able to reholster your gun.  if you need that other hand free, which we'll get to.  Number five, things can happen at any time.  It looked like this was in the middle of the day.  This guy's about to go jet skiing with his kids or coming back from jet skiing.  Pulls up at the gas station and bam, he's right in the middle of a defensive gun use incident.  Luckily, things ended well for him.  He stopped the attack.  No one else got hurt and he didn't have to fire any shots.  Good job.  And that kind of brings me to my next point, number six.  Do you know who exactly you're willing to protect with your firearm?  I was just reading the Varg Freeborn book, Violence of Mind, which I'll link to in the description below.  And he talks about knowing your mission.  Who are you willing to protect with your gun?  Yourself, family, friends?  A lady you don't know that's being attacked in a parking lot while you have two kids in the truck?  Sure, this guy could have driven away, but he didn't.  He decided to put himself into that situation to stop the attack.  But you need to answer that question, what is your mission, before you find yourself in an incident like this?  Are you just going to protect your family and make sure you get home at night?  Or are you willing to protect complete strangers?  Number seven, this one's kind of brief, but one-handed shooting.  Now this whole incident, this guy had one hand on his gun, the other hand taking the guy down or subduing him.  So how often do you practice shooting with one hand?  How often do you practice shooting with your support hand?  If you don't, you should add that to your practice routine at the range and at home when you're dry firing.  You are dry firing at home, right?  All right, we're getting there.  Number eight, holding somebody down at gunpoint until police arrives.  This one can be a little sketchy.  Now, that guy didn't have a weapon on him, so if he did get up and run, I don't think he would have been justified in shooting him because he was fleeing, right?  And then when police arrive, they just see someone holding a guy on the ground pointing a gun at him.  They don't necessarily see a good guy holding a criminal down waiting for police to arrive.  Salvatore, one of our writers at usacarry.com, just wrote an article covering this and some other stuff, which I'll link up here.  So if you can, you want to make sure you or someone else calls the police, gives them a good description of you, the bad guy, and what's going on in this situation, so that when police do show up, they might have a good idea of who the good guy and the bad guy is.  And as always, comply with all the commands.  They might be telling you to drop the gun, get on the ground, put your hands behind your back.  Again, they might not know who the good guy and the bad guy is, so you just need to comply and let them sort it out.  And the last one, number nine.  I'd like to touch on using a quality holster that would allow you to re-holster if needed with one hand.  In this situation, the good guy had to hand his gun off to somebody else to keep the assailant subdued.  In a perfect world, I'd rather just re-holster my own gun instead of handing it to somebody else.  I don't know, even if they're trying to help.  I don't want to be handing my gun over to a complete stranger.  And this also makes me think about holsters that are mounted inside your car.  Now this guy pulled his gun from his console and didn't take his holster with him, so he couldn't re-holster.  But there are some ways to mount guns inside your vehicle and they may seem like you have better access to them, but what happens in a situation like this?  If you have to grab your gun and then you're outside the car, what do you do?  Your holster's still in the car.  So don't consider your car a holster.  Personally, I appendix carry, so if something like this happened and I had to draw my pistol in the car and then get out the car, I still have my holster on me so I can re-holster when I need to.  And no, appendix carry isn't uncomfortable while I'm seated in my truck.  I carry that way all the time.  It took me a while to figure out the right holster to make it work for me, but it was well worth the time and money spent.  I have quick access to my gun and that holster is always going to be on me.  I'm also not doing any unnecessary gun manipulation while I'm getting in and out of the truck, reholstering or anything like that.  That's where I carry.  I get in the truck.  I drive to where I'm going.  I get out.  I'm not messing with holsters.  I'm not messing with guns.  All right.
