            "text": "Let's go for it.  in I have a lot of dreams so it's not the only but it's one of the primary ways that the Holy Spirit speaks to me is in dreams and in visions or visitations.  so it was after he had been elected.  now I could talk before he was elected but that's not the purpose of this because I need to give you a word of encouragement and a call to prayer concerning the Supreme Court of the United States of America.  After there was the first replacement of which was a righteous judge that President Trump then appointed to the court.  Then there was the big battle with Kavanaugh's appointment.  And many were like uncertain or they're going, yes, this is right.  And this thing.  So I went before the Lord asking God, what's your plan?  that night the Lord visited me and I heard the following.  he said President Trump by the way I need to put a qualifier.  we hear in part we know in part and even the best only prophesy in part and that's why we need each other to bring our parts together.  then we see the greater puzzle of the whole.  so I heard from the Lord, President Trump is appointed to put in place three new judges to the Supreme Court.  And he spoke to me about Kavanaugh, that he was critical.  It would be one of the greatest fights in spiritual warfare over an appointment for the Supreme Court that we've ever had in history.  But it would go through.  But there would be a third appointment.  appointee that President Trump is assigned to bring.  He told me it would be a woman.  She will be a modern-day Esther.  She will stand strong for pro-life, and she will help for the future to return the court.  This is the word of what I heard from the Lord, to true constitutional conservatism.  Yes.  Praise God.  That's what we have to have. ",

            "text": "So this would have been, you know, a year and a half to two years ago.  But it went past the, you know, Kavanaugh's appointment.  I saw the warfare around it, but that if we would pray, he would come through.  But then it deals with another appointee.  And so here's what I want you to understand.  Now, I just came from a group of leaders just last week in Washington,  D.C.,  for the helping birth of a prayer movement, bringing the movements together called One Voice Prayer Movement to pray every week for the executive branch of the government.  It's something new that's never happened in the history of this nation.  And so I prophesied at Apostle Maldonado's in Miami.  Yes.  And I prophesied that there is going to be the greatest prayer movement for the U.S.  government that this nation has ever seen, and there will be intercession that will arise for every cabinet position and every branch of government.  Now, I believe that is coming.  I'm speaking to that which is not, and I'm calling it as though it already is.  So then in this with President Trump, So when is this going to happen?  Does that mean that he's going to win this coming election?  I believe it is God's will.  that he'd win the twenty twenty election.  but because we are called to be co-laborers with God there is the providential sovereignty of God.  then there's man's free choice.  so prayer is the voting is the work that is attached to our faith because faith without corresponding actions according to the book of James is dead.  so voting is to our faith for elections and so it's don't stay home.  That's right.  Invest your faith and exercise your faith by a righteous vote.  Vote pro-life.  Yes.  Vote for pro-Israel.  Amen.  Vote for good trade.  Yes.  Vote for righteousness.  Do this.  The Lord showed me that we would in this year as you have seen that this would be called the year of the great divide.  The year of the great exact polar opposites arising and be the year of the great divide.  But he also spoke to me that there is the potential of healing in the midst of the great divide of which then it will be the culture of honor is the only thing that could heal the time of the great divide.  But back to President Trump.  So will he be re-elected?  It is, I believe, the Father's will.  But we must align with the Father's choice, not our choice, with God's choice, and we must align our works with our faith.  Okay, so that's just an issue there.  And so when will this?  third, I know who is supposed to resign, The Holy Spirit spoke to me that if this justice, he's going to give this particular justice time to repent.  I know who it is.  He told me by name.  I'm not going to say by air the name of the person.  I think you can figure it out.  But he told me he was going to give time for this particular justice to repent.  To come to the Lord.  Yes.  And if they don't, they will be removed.  Wow.  And the Lord is going to create a vacancy on the Supreme Court.  Is it going to be in this term or the next one by God?  My belief is that this person is going to hang on, hang on, hang on, and try to hang on into the next administration, hoping that President Trump is not reelected, but God's going to got a Trump card, and there is going to be a woman who is going to be appointed, and she will be an Esther, a modern-day Esther, and she will tip the scales of the U.S.  Supreme Court towards constitutional conservatism in Jesus' name.  Wow, I love it. ",
