            "text": "Now, my parents moved to Canada.  I'm very happy about that.  They moved to Canada, America's hat.  It's so much better, because they couldn't move to America, Canada's jockstrap.  But Canada and America get compared all the time.  You know, and I think they're very different countries.  And all you have to do is look at their leaders, all right?  Canada elected Justin Trudeau.  He's very pretty, you know?  He tries a little bit too hard.  He's like the Anne Hathaway of world leaders.  But he's well-read, he speaks English and French, he's very Canadian.  Now, America... Yeah, America elected Donald Trump.  The Donald Trump of world leaders.  You know, can't read, barely speaks English.  The only thing Canadian about him is that he's the same color as Kraft Dinner.  All right, like, I love Canada, all right?  Clean water, universal health care, women's curling.  Oh, my God.  Women's curlers are so hot.  Is it just me?  They're so hot.  I think it's because I'm a fan of punctuality, so I just get turned on any time a woman yells at me to hurry.  Hurry hard!  I will.  I will.  No, but I love women's curling, and I love Canada.  I love Canada.  But I'm not American about it, you know?  Because Americans are obnoxiously patriotic.  They need you to know that they're American, all right?  But Canadians, like, we're proud to be Canadian, but part of being Canadian is that, especially as a child of an immigrant, we never forget who we are, all right?  I think that is really the difference between our two countries.  And I think here's an example to illustrate the difference, all right?  I was recently in Europe.  I was at the airport.  I was in line to board my flight.  And this woman wearing a shirt made out of a U.S.  flag and a hat that said, America, America, great again, which were both probably made in China, she cuts in front of me in line, right?  But I'm a Canadian, so I don't say anything.  She gets on the plate in front of me.  She's got three bags.  She puts them in the overhead compartment.  There's no room for my stuff, but I'm a Canadian, so I don't say anything.  And then she gets in the seat right in front of me, reclines the seat the whole way, right in my face.  But I'm a Canadian, so I don't say anything.  But because I'm Chinese, I passive-aggressively need her in the back for the entire flight.  I might not be able to make America great again, but as a minority, I can definitely make America uncomfortable.  You guys have been fantastic.  Thank you guys very much. ",
