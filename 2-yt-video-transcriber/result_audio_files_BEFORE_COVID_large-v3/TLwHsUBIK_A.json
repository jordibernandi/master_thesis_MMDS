            "text": "The concept of class and class conflict are both incredibly critical in understanding the nature of capitalism and the role of the modern state.  The casual understanding of class is that it's got something to do with how much money you have.  You've got the rich, the poor, and the middle class.  However, the Marxist understanding of class is a much more precise and useful tool.  And it's this understanding of class that I want to explore in this video.  The first step in understanding what class is, is recognizing we are all fundamentally material beings.  We are not these immortal creatures that exist outside the physical world.  We are material beings with material needs we must satisfy in order to live.  so where the concept of class comes in is when we begin to ask how a given individual must go about satisfying these material needs.  what means of sustenance are available to this individual?  so a farmer's means of sustenance would be farming the land.  Identifying the means of sustenance is another way of identifying how the individual relates to the means of production.  Quick side note, the means of production, put simply, is the stuff that produces stuff.  So when we ask how someone must go about sustaining themselves, it's a question of how they relate to this production line.  And there's no one who is exempt from this production line.  Everyone relates to it somehow.  Alright, so the farmer's relation to the means of production are quite straightforward.  He owns the land, he owns the tools, and he must labor the land to sustain himself.  This would be his class.  A given individual's class is determined by how one relates to the means of production.  Now, on its own, this isn't particularly useful.  Who gives a shit how someone relates to the means of production?  The real usefulness of this concept of class is that it gives us insight into the material interests of a given class.  Let's go back to the farmer for a second.  We understand their relation to the means of production.  They own the tools, they own the land, etc.  Understanding this, the farmer's interests become quite clear.  It's in the farmer's interest for good weather, a plentiful yield, minimal pest interference, hopes his tools won't wear down too quickly, and he hopes he can preserve his yields for as long as possible.  His material interests are straightforward.  Now let's suppose there are five friends and they're all farmers.  They all have the same relation to the means of production.  They all own the land together, they all own the tools together, and to sustain themselves they must labor the land.  So these individuals would be a part of the same class.  And in being a part of the same class, their material interests are the same as well.  They hope for good weather, good yield, minimal wear on tools, etc.  None of their material interests are in opposition, because they have the exact same relation to the means of production.  Okay, so now we're going to add a bit of complexity to this.  Suppose there's a sixth individual, and we'll affectionately call him Fuckface.  So Fuckface owns the tools and he owns the land.  The other five don't own anything.  All they have is their labor.  Fuckface's means of sustenance, i.e.  his relation to the means of production, is getting the other five to work his tools and land so he can eat.  Fuckface occupies a different class than the others, as he has a different relation to the means of production, and thus has different and conflicting material interests.  Fuckface wants to take as much of the yield as possible for himself, leaving just enough grain to sustain the other five, but no more.  The surplus grain he obtains can be used to sustain other individuals who may carry out the force needed to get the other five to work, or support a militia to take over more lands, etc.  His material interests are to take as much of the yield as possible.  Whereas the five farmers, their interest is to keep as much of the yield as possible to reduce their workloads.  The interests of Fuckface and the interests of the farmers are in conflict.  It is not a cooperative relationship, but a combative one, where both classes struggle against one another.  This society I've laid out is a society in conflict, and the only way to keep this society together is through the use of coercive and manipulative forces.  Otherwise, this society would fall apart.  Okay, so far I've been talking about class in this somewhat abstract and hypothetical sense, but let's bring this concept home.  Let's take a look at our society, a capitalist society, and understand the classes that constitute it.  Under capitalism, there are two distinct and primary classes, capitalists and workers.  The relationship capitalists have to the means of production is that they own them privately.  Their means of sustenance is getting others to labor on these productive means to produce goods and services to be sold.  the relationship workers have to the means of production is renting their labor out.  These two classes have distinct and conflicting material interests.  Capitalists want workers to work as hard as possible and pay them as little as possible for their labor, just enough to sustain them and propagate their race.  The interests of the workers, on the other hand, is that they want to be paid as much as possible for the labor they do.  These interests are in direct conflict.  These classes are in direct conflict.  It is not a cooperative relationship, no matter how many times capitalists say otherwise.  It is a combative relationship and a relationship of exploitation.  The workers are the ones who generate the wealth and it's the capitalists who skim the surplus generated and keep it for themselves.  To further the interests of one class is to necessarily hurt the interests of the other.  Any policy that claims to be beneficial for both classes is a lie, plain and simple.  Our capitalist society is a society in conflict.  The only way the society is held together is through the use of coercive and manipulative forces.  This is the primary role of the state, a tool of oppression used to protect the interests of the capitalist class by holding together and maintaining this exploitative system.  In simpler terms, the modern state exists to secure the existence of the capitalist class and to advance their interests.  Without this state, the capitalist mode of production would collapse.  This conflict between the two classes is a conflict that cannot be resolved under capitalism, for this is the nature of capitalism.  There are those who privately own the means of production and there are those who rent themselves out.  For this conflict, a conflict between two diametrically opposed classes to resolve itself requires the ultimate break of either class and with it the passing of capitalism.  The capitalist class cannot exist without the laboring class.  The ruin of the laboring class spells the common ruin of all classes.  The socialist sees the only legitimate way forward is the abolition of the capitalist class.  freeing the means of production from private ownership and moving it into the common domain to be operated by all, democratically.  This radical and revolutionary reconstitution of society not only spells the death of capitalism, but establishes a classless society as well.  A society in which everyone runs and operates the means of production democratically is a society in which everyone's relation to the means of production is equal.  This is what's meant by a classless society.  A classless society doesn't mean a society in which everyone is the same in every single regard and any deviation from the norm will be put down immediately.  It just means a society in which everyone is equal in their relation to the means of production.  That's it.  As everyone relates to the means of production equally, everyone's material interests are congruent.  There is no adversarial economic group with opposing material interests.  All are equal.  As there is no class conflict, the modern state as a tool of oppression is no longer needed.  And thus, with a classless society, anarchists and communists see to ultimately do away with the state as a tool of oppression.  If there's anything you take away from this video, it should be this concept of class conflict.  In a capitalist system where there are two distinct groups with different and oppositional modes of satisfying their material needs, we find a permanent and unyielding conflict of material interests between the classes.  This class conflict makes capitalism an inherently volatile system and necessitates the existence of the state to maintain this affair of exploitation.  Thank you so much for taking the time to watch this video, and I hope you now have a more intimate understanding of class and class conflict.  I also want to thank you all for the incredible response I got on my last video, What is Neoliberalism?  If you haven't seen it, definitely do so.  It was just really heartwarming to see all the comments and even have some of you share it on Twitter.  That was wild.  Also, a big, big thank you to Leonard Balk, my first ever patron.  Honestly, fantastic.  Thank you.  Also, a big thank you to Becquerel.  I had finished recording the audio to this video, but I wanted to take the time to thank you as well.
