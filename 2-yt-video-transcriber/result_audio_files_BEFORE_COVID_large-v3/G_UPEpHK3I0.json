            "text": "Honest question, why is anyone still supporting Jaclyn Hill?  Here's the thing, and I'm gonna try to keep it cute, but we're talking about Jaclyn Hill, so.  Sorry guys, no time for formalities today.  It's tea.  Chasing some clout, jumping right in.  I know some people are gonna be pissed at me for even talking about this, but if that is you, you exercised free will and still clicked on the video, so girl, I don't really know what to tell you.  All right, Jaclyn Hill Cosmetics, or Jaclyn Cosmetics, whatever it's called.  um the makeup line.  that has been a good half decade in the making.  we've been hearing about this product range for so long that i remember being teased back when i was actually still subscribed to Jaclyn Hill.  and girl it has been years since that was the case.  I unsubscribed from Miss Shill, I mean Hill, at least three scandals ago.  Frankly, she has just shown her ass too many times.  Nonetheless, she continues to fail upwards on the rare occasions that I look at the YouTube trending page, which is a lot like looking inside of a dumpster.  Like, you know, when you look in there, it's going to be a bunch of trash, but for some reason you're still kind of curious to be like, well, what kind of trash?  Anyway, once in a blue moon, when I look at the trending page, invariably there's a Jaclyn Hill video on there.  So even YouTube is intent on shoving her and her chicanery down people's throats.  And the fact that she's constantly on there is kind of impressive only because she only uploads content when there's a new Morphe release or she has to do damage control for her most recent Morphe release.  I'm saying she's not the most consistent YouTuber.  Anyway, getting back to her many, many controversies, has there been a single release from this woman that hasn't had a major issue?  which she then either downplayed to make it seem not as bad as it truly was after the fact, or shifted blame to the company or the lab or even the consumer.  The only smooth-ish collab I can think of is her Champagne Pop release with Becca, which to this day I think is a very successful product for Becca, mainly because it combined the colors of two pre-existing shades of their highlighters.  So it wasn't exactly rocket surgery or brain science for that matter.  I think Temptalia even did a comparison swatch of, I want to say, Moonstone and Opal mixed together when Champagne Pop first released and it was legit identical to Champagne Pop.  I remember trying to find that exact blog post where she showed it but I think she must have taken it down at some point for one reason or another, probably brand relations.  But I do remember seeing it with absolute certainty.  So, Jaclyn Hill's one successful collab product was pretty much something that already existed, and then I think she even got caught lying on that in some way or another.  I'm not positive, but I'm almost certain that she lied to exaggerate the scarcity of Champagne Pop when it first came out.  Now, that is neither here nor there, really.  The point is, every single time Jaclyn Hill releases a collab, there is a problem.  And not a minor one, the kind of problem that completely takes over the narrative within the YouTube makeup community, every single time.  At this point, I'm just convinced that she's the queen of trolling collabs.  all of her marketing strategy seems to be outrage marketing because she keeps scamming her audience over and over and over.  i'm not gonna dig into the details of all of her scandals and repeated fraudulence but it's so consistent that i'm honestly just at a point where i don't understand one why people are surprised that there's a major problem with the latest Jaclyn Hill product release.  Or more accurately, two, I legit don't understand why is anyone still buying Jaclyn Hill products at all?  I don't even need to get into the Champagne Pop eye palette the makeup geek palette that never happened and of course the vault fiasco probably her biggest blunder to date.  up until she released these tired ass lipsticks for those of you who are still with me and have had no idea what I'm talking about up to this point Jaclyn Hill released the collection of 20 nudes lipsticks which honestly based on some of these shades.  I'm not entirely convinced that Jaclyn Hill understands what nude means because some of these shades are straight up vampy colors and brights.  Anyway, it took four or five years for this?  Didn't KKW Beauty already do a whole ass collection of wack ass nudes like three years ago?  What is this Cosco Cardassian doing?  Like, I don't understand what Jaclyn Hill is doing.  Then on top of the big reveal of her makeup line being boring and nowhere near worth a four or five year wait, come to find out these lipsticks were most likely waiting on a shelf somewhere in a warehouse for God knows how long, probably somewhere in the vicinity of four years.  Most likely because they had to take a backseat to her constant Morphe collaborations.  So now we're seeing all these reports of people getting lipsticks that have gone off, that have fucking hairs in them, or they've melted, they have weird textures, weird smells, possible mold, all kinds of problems that I've legit never even seen or heard of before with lipsticks.  Yesterday, Raw Beauty Christy uploaded a video where she put her lipsticks from Jaclyn Hill under a microscope and it was appalling.  Her video is straight up.  what put me over the edge to even give my unsolicited, unwanted, nobody asked you ho opinion.  Because really, this is a legitimate public health safety issue.  I will link Raw Beauty Christy's video below along with any others that I can find that properly chronicle Jaclyn Hill's history of lying about literally everything she's put out before this, including things that don't even matter and aren't worth lying about, all I'm saying is she has made it abundantly clear that she does not care about y'all.  She is a charlatan the end.  And she's laughing all the way to the bank time and time again.  You know, there's that old cliche, fool me once, shame on, shame on you.  Fool me twice, Can't get fooled again.  Well, if we're talking about Jaclyn Hill, we're on Fool Me eight or nine or 10 times.  And the only fools are the people still buying shit from her.  Like, what are you doing?  Needless to say, I do not trust Jaclyn Hill.  And frankly, to take that a step even farther, I don't trust anybody with a Morphe code, mainly because of Jaclyn Hill.  And that has high key become my new sign off if you've been watching my most recent videos all the way to the end.  I'm just really sick of all of these YouTubers who, once they hit it big, abandon all integrity, assuming they ever had it in the first place.  It shouldn't be this unspoken thing of not being able to trust anyone who has over a million subscribers, but that is certainly the way things have gone.  Over the past several days, I had seen things on Instagram of people with issues with these lipsticks and stuff, and I didn't really care too much.  I wasn't going to stick my beak in it because I couldn't be bothered.  But when I saw those disgusting lipsticks in Christie's video yesterday, I was pissed.  I'm not afraid.  of Jaclyn's tween-age stans leaving dumbass comments.  Ain't no thing to block and report, baby.  I just feel that it's about time people stop being so permissive with this kind of repeated thievery from some of these big influencers.  It's just not right.  I think it should be possible to be successful on these platforms, YouTube, Instagram, whatever, without lying your way to the top.  As far as I'm concerned, the only good thing Jaclyn Hill ever did was expose Kathleen Lights for saying the N-word because that was information I needed to know.  But beyond that, we should have all stopped allowing ourselves to be hoodwinked, bamboozled, and run amok by that woman years ago.  Maybe if more people had spoken up sooner, perhaps we wouldn't be at a point where she still has enough good faith to sling moldy ass lipsticks to people who keep spending their hard-earned money, or more accurately, their parents' hard-earned money, on her trash.  anyway rant over vis-a-vis miss jaclyn hill.  i will be right back after i put on some lashes.  lashes are on and drying so in the meantime i wanted to give a shout out and thank you to all of you who showed so much love on my last lookbook.  i really appreciate it.  i know my fashion videos are not the most popular but in many ways they are the ones that i enjoy doing the most more than makeup and more than hair for certain.  That was by far the most fun I've had filming a lookbook out of all the ones I've ever done and I'm most happy with how it turned out compared to all the other ones I've done as well.  I was really excited to be able to shoot on that beautiful wall.  I felt like it was Perfect for pride month.  as a matter of fact today is the pride parade here in LA and West Hollywood Which is why I'm getting ready.  Normally, I don't really do too much for pride because well, I got no skin in this game But it's basically like our Mardi Gras here in LA.  So a party is a party.  I In any event, there are more look books on the way and probably sooner.  I know I don't do them that often, mainly because of lack of interest, but I think even still I want to do them more often, probably like seasonally I'm thinking.  And I also want to try out some more evergreen themes of them.  You know, themes of how I like to style certain things, whether it's like five ways to wear blank, how I style and choose things for my body type, which is very obviously a hair.  I say all that to say that the theme of what the hell is this channel exactly is going to continue.  I am painfully aware that my channel is all over the place these past few weeks to a month or so and that trend will continue.  I'm just going to keep doing my thing, keep doing what feels good, what feels right to me.  and you know, those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.  And by the way, jumping back to my lookbook real quick, I'm pretty pissed at y'all for selling out that jumpsuit that I featured in there, by the way, because I was going to buy another color, but y'all bought them all up.  I think because it's a super hot day today, I might not even do coverage.  I straight up think I'm just going to do a little bit of brightener under my eye with my Touche Eclat, and then I'll probably do a little bit of highlight contour blush, but I'm not going to do concealer or foundation.  Just going to be schvitzing it off anyway.  Speaking of schvitzing, I am on the penultimate week of the Stephanie Buttermore Jeff Nippard Women's Specialization Program.  I've got less than two weeks to go.  I did the first of the two upper body workouts today, which I was very grumpy about because I hate upper body, especially when... It's just boring upper body.  That's not meant to be a slight against the program itself.  I just am not inspired by your traditional gym-style upper body workouts.  Three sets of shoulder presses.  Three sets of skull crushers.  Like, that is just... I hate working upper body as it is.  So when I do work upper body, I much more prefer for it to be skill-based, where I'm working on my handstands or... I don't know, just other more dynamic movements rather than just like picking up a dumbbell and putting it down, you know, that kind of thing.  But anyway, the review for the women's specialization program will be coming out soon.  As for what I'm going to do after that She Tried It review, I'm not too sure.  I really am tempted to go back to another Natasha Oceane program because those are my favorites that I've done on.  She Tried It by far.  So I'm debating between doing Move, which is the first one she ever did, which I still have never tried, Cut Reload, because I did Cut last year, some of you guys will remember, and I really want to see how the new one compares.  But she also released a new one just a couple days ago called Build that I also really want to try.  So maybe I'll put a poll here to see which one you guys would be most interested in me doing if I do another Natasha Ocien program on my next.  She Tried It, because... I do also have an Abby Pollock program, which I'm not that keen to do right after this Jeff Knippert, Stephanie Buttermore one, just because I imagine it's going to be very similar in that sort of by the book, gym style kind of programming.  Or I could always try something completely different, you know, not do Natasha, not do Abby, and maybe just try something completely different.  So feel free to leave any programs or trainers who put things out that you might be interested in me reviewing in the comments section.  But ultimately, because it is my money and my time commitment more importantly, It does have to be something that I feel like I will enjoy and that I feel like I will be challenged by.  So I'm open to new things, but I'm learning.  I'm pretty picky about what I'm actually willing to commit to for.  She Tried It because it's my time, my effort, and I don't want to be miserable doing a program that I wasn't all that interested in in the first place.  A lot of you guys have suggested Britney Babe programs to me over the past couple years since I started doing these.  She Tried It reviews.  I'm very well familiar with Britney Babe.  I've never done one of her programs because I think they're a bit too beginner for me.  I am an intermediate slash advanced level exerciser, I would say, just based on my strength and some of the skills that I have.  So if something is going to be too entry level for me, I'm not going to bother.  It's just not going to be challenging enough.  It's not going to help me actually continue on my fitness and getting stronger and things like that.  So while I do support Britney, babe, her programs are not quite for me.  I also follow Masi Arias on Instagram, and I've always been kind of curious about her programs.  Her programs tend to be, I think, in the 30-day range.  So that would actually be really nice because it would be nice to have something shorter so I could kind of get another review out relatively quickly rather than the, in some cases, 12-week programs that I have.  The one I'm on now has been an eight-weeker, which is nice.  But yeah, some of these programs by Natasha... Home was 10 weeks.  Cut was 10 weeks.  But her newest one is 12.  Move is 12.  And I feel like I would probably be able to review the longer ones before necessarily finishing them.  So that's not a huge deal.  I feel like by the halfway point, I've got a pretty good sense of what it's all about.  But it's just something to bear in mind is the actual time commitment of a program in terms of me being able to turn around the review.  I feel a little weird going out without any real complexion products except contour and I'm about to do some highlight and I already have on blush as you guys saw.  But I just don't see much point.  I'm just going to be schvitzing the second I step outside.  Some of you guys will remember me picking this up in my Sephora sale haul.  I've basically been using this nonstop.  I love it.  It's maybe my favorite highlighter that I've ever used.  Obviously, it will be linked below along with everything else that I've been putting on my face.  If this is your first rodeo with one of my get ranty with me's, That's what I do because I don't, I'm usually too busy getting my points across to remember to call out the products I'm using.  So everything is in the description box.  And it would be anyway, even if I were calling it out, but a lot of people don't bother checking.  I need to grab my mascara to put on my bottom lashes and then I'm going to throw on some sort of easy lip, easy to deal with.  Bottom lash mascara is on.  I just want to add a bit of brightness to my inner tear duct.  Really like how this look turned out.  I didn't know what the hell I was going to do.  I just wanted to kind of get rolling because I knew I wanted to talk to you guys while also getting ready.  So I just kind of went on autopilot.  But I quite like how these colors are looking together.  Little blendy blend.  One thing I've learned about doing my makeup is when you think you blended enough, blend a little bit more anyway.  I don't know if I can pull off the no coverage look, but we're going for it today.  Got to line my lips.  Liner and gloss.  That's it.  And with that, she ready.  So here are the requisite awkward slow-mo shots of the final makeup.  And with that, I got to get out of here because A, I'm hungry, and B, I got people to see and things to do.  As you can see, I did change into my beloved captain that you guys will see if you watched my lookbook, my last video.  I'll link it here in case you missed it.  I love this thing.  It's really breathable, and I feel like it'll keep me nice and cool in the sweltering heat that we have today.  That is going to do her.  Happy Pride, everybody.  Have a wonderful week.  Thank you for hanging out with me, and never trust anyone with a Morphe code.  Bye-bye.  That's a nappy-headed hose there.  I'm going to take that down. ",
