            "text": "Ahoy there, all you pro-EU social justice warriors out there.  So it looks like your beloved EU has decided the poor should be bashed into shouldering the cost of Brexit and more.  Firstly, as ever, please kick that YouTube algorithm up the jacksie by giving this video a big fat like.  News is emerging that the EU has plans to ensure that it can weather any shortfall it suffers because of the loss of UK funding post-Brexit by squeezing the poor.  But not only that, the EU wants to use some of the money saved this way to spend on more defence.  In the budget that finishes at the end of 2020, there is an EU fund of 3.8 billion euros for the most deprived people.  But this disappears from the new budget starting in 2021.  So you pro-EU lovies, herald your new EU empire, built on the backs of the poor.  Now I can already predict the reaction from the UK pro-EU lobby, blaming Brexit for the poor across the European Union having to bear the brunt of the EU budget shortfall.  These will be the same people that have been bleating on for years about the so-called ideologically driven austerity by the UK Tory government.  Yet I bet those exact same hypocritical SJWs will quite happily overlook the EU's ideological prioritisation for its own expansionism and militarisation overriding the needs of its own poor, while its bureaucrats, commissioners and MEPs enjoy the highest of lives.  But at the end of the day, how the member states of the EU allow their funding to be spent by the bureaucrats is up to them to decide.  Oh, and where did I find this story?  In the Guardian.  Not the Mail, not the Telegraph or not the Express.  So to the lefty types it's written in tablets of stone and must be true.  According to the Guardian report, the president of the European Food Banks Federation, Jacques van den Schrik, said that these plans posed a risk to both the needy and to the stability of society as a whole.  And on its website, the European Food Banks Federation says that Together in 2018, we provided 781,000 tonnes of food, equivalent to 4.3 million daily meals, to 45,700 charitable organisations for the benefit of 9.3 million deprived people.  But as I said, the empire-building EU Commission would rather spend more money on defence, or would that be military influence, if you get my drift?  Van den Schrik said, I think we must do better for the poorest of the poor.  We cannot accept that we must deliver half or 60% of the food that they receive now.  The explanation is that the overall budget of Europe needs to be tightened up.  Brexit is one of the arguments.  The other is the need for the strengthening of the defence of Europe.  But this will have an impact on health and social cohesion.  It is a false economy to save on the poor.  It is far better to increase their purchase power by giving them food so that the little money they don't spend on food they can spend on the economy.  He also said that there would be an increase in instability and incivility.  If people and their children are hungry, they will make plans and this might not be very nice for society.  We cannot make progress by leaving the poor on the side.  This is not the way to make our society better.  And to all those SJWs out there pointing fingers at the Tories, I hope you'll now get on your bicycles and hop across into the EU and try your bossy techniques on the Eurocrats.  Or are you going to do what you normally do, put a halo over the EU flag, despite what it's done in places like Greece, southern Italy and Catalonia,  etc.,  while lambasting your own people and government for just wanting a self-governing nation?  One silver lining of this budget squeeze though might be that Tony Blair will be refused the EU funding he's been asking for to fund his pet projects.  But EU-based rubber dinghy manufacturers might do well out of it though.  Now, moving on.  It looks like the port of Calais is erecting signs to direct UK-only traffic into a separate lane for special control checks.  So is this an indicator that we're leaving the EU on WTO terms when we leave the Brexit implementation period at the end of 2020?  Does the erection of this new signage in Calais, which directs EU-bound UK traffic carrying food, produce, animals and plants onto a separate lane for sanitary phyto-control checks, indicate that France, or the whole EU come to that, think we're headed for a no-deal Brexit in 12 months' time?  Well, it could.  But there are, maybe, other possibilities too.  Just to clarify, sanitary phyto measures, or more fully, sanitary and phytosanitary, or SPS measures, are there to protect humans, animals and plants from diseases, pests and contaminants.  So the EU may be planning for a no deal by the end of 2020 but they could also be looking to plan for a less than comprehensive free trade agreement or a bare bones agreement with the UK at the end of 2020 that does not cover all aspects of food and plant produce as well as animals and maybe even pets.  But the one thing it does indicate is that the realisation is dawning across the channel that the UK will be leaving the EU behind, deal or no deal, by the end of 2020.  These signs were spotted by former advisor to Nigel Farage, Trixie Sanderson, reports the Express, and she said that the signs had not been up for very long, maybe just for a few days.  So you do have to ask, why now?  Won't these signs just cause confusion over the next year when nothing is meant to change?  Why not wait until nearer the time?  After all, these signs surely won't take that long to put up.  So you could do all the background planning, then erect the signs if and when you need them.  But there is another possibility, one that many might overlook.  The UK is still headed on a legal course to leave the EU without a deal on 31 January 2020, just 33 days away.  Despite all the talk about withdrawal agreement treaties and withdrawal agreement bills, the laws have not yet been passed and the withdrawal agreement is yet to be ratified by both the EU and the UK.  So we could still leave the EU in just over a month's time without a deal.  Now consider that the UK Parliament is about to pass a law that includes making it illegal for our Prime Minister Boris Johnson to extend the Brexit implementation period beyond 31 December 2020.  But further, as I explained in a video when the new withdrawal agreement bill was published, within that law it also includes a clause that effectively prevents the UK government from signing up to anything binding between the EU and UK regarding the process of coming to a trade agreement, apart from the agreement itself.  It makes the implementation period oversight body, the joint committee, a toothless and pointless body with no more power than a talking shop.  As far as I can see, this unilateral UK law converts the Withdrawal Agreement Treaty into a non-extendable agreement where the EU has no ability to force the UK's hand.  Even if the EU Commission demanded that the UK signed up to an extension or some other binding rule, Boris can smile sweetly and say he's not allowed to.  And as I said in that previous video, it uses exactly the same legal technique to tie the government's hands as was used in the Ben's Surrender Act, and remember that was watertight.  But this time, the government and the country are very happy with the situation.  But I still reckon some or other Ramona will try a Gina Miller on.  But that other Remain litigant backer, Jolyon Moorham QC, might be otherwise engaged in arguing a case regarding a certain Volpiz Volpiz.  This UK legal move also neatly ties the hands of the EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.  So all this might make the EU Commission, the EU Council and the EU Parliament all very wary of ratifying the withdrawal agreement under these suddenly changed circumstances.  Now part of the process from the EU side is that the EU Commission, which has been tasked with heading the negotiations up on the EU side, must together with the EU Council give Michel Barnier the parameters within which to negotiate.  They have to instruct him on his mandate.  And this mandate will have to include the EU strategy to deal with the UK closing down the maximum negotiating timescale in such a way.  So could it be that in the new year we will see the EU Commission and or the EU Council try and apply pressure by refusing to ratify the withdrawal agreement until the unilateral UK restrictions were lifted, with guarantees?  But remember, if the EU refuses to ratify the withdrawal agreement, the UK is out on WTO terms at the end of January.  So is that what the early erection of these signs is all about?  Telling us that the EU is prepared to go no deal Brexit on the 31st of January unless we agree to the possibility to extend the implementation period talks beyond the 31st of December next year.  The only other choice the EU has is to meekly accept what the UK Parliament has done and proceed accordingly with their backs to the wall of a hard 31st December 2020 end date.  And if the EU ratifies the withdrawal agreement knowing this to be the case, one supposes they'll have no recourse in law to complain because they will have known exactly what they were signing up to.  I just hope the EU does start complaining and threatening the UK with a hard no-deal WTO Brexit at the end of January, unless we play by their rules.  Because by that time the UK laws will be in place, and with no obstructive Parliament in his way and no route for the courts to interfere, Boris and his Tories will have no choice but to follow it through.  Be interesting to see how the EU does deal with this.  But at the end of the day, take a look at the signs in the express piece and tell me that a no-deal Brexit is not a possibility.  But if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck and lays an egg, then it's probably not a horse.  Anyway, what do you think either about the EU bashing the poor or the possible EU response to the UK banning any extension to the talks?  Please share and comment.  And thank you for watching. ",
