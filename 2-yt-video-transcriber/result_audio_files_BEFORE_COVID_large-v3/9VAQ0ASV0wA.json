            "text": "Hey guys, Bix Weir, RoadDriver.com.  Just got back in the office and voila, Chinese bank runs have started.  This is just one.  Actually, there's been four.  This is a big one.  And watch for a lot more of this.  Watch the European banks over the next two weeks.  Watch the U.S.  banks right after that.  We are not far from the endgame.  Keep an eye on what I was talking about this morning.  Go to this morning's video.  Fed repos, they're going to go to intraday repos.  Instant repos is basically taking all the money in the world, holding it out and say, grab what you need.  Happy Halloween.  Voila.  And that ain't going to fly too far.  The problem right now is not the liquidity, is not the repo market, is that the banks have completely withdrawn from lending to each other because they know everything is screwed up so bad beyond repair.  They would be derelict in their duties if they participated in any market outside of the Fed.  So the Fed's going to have to fund everybody, which is going to be $20 trillion.  They're going to come to Congress for $20 trillion, and it ain't going to happen, in my opinion.  Anyway, Chinese bank on the verge of collapse after sudden bank run.  First it was Beishang Bank and then it was Bank of Jinsu.  Then two months ago, China's Hinfeng Bank with 1.4 quadrillion yuan in assets quietly failed and was just as quietly nationalized.  Today, a fourth prominent Chinese bank was on the verge of collapse under the weight of its bad loans.  Only this time the failure was far less quiet as depositors of the Rural lenders swarm the bank's retail outlets, demanding their money in an angry demonstration of what Beijing is terrified of the most, a bank run.  Local business leaders, political cadres, and banking executives rallied Thursday at the main branch of Hinnan Hushan Rural Commercial Bank just outside the central city of Luoyang, where they stood one by one before a microphone to pledge their backing for the bank as smiling employees brandish wads of cash before television cameras to demonstrate just how much cash, literally, the bank had.  This is insane.  It was China's latest and most desperate attempt to project stability and reassure the public that all is well after rumors spread that the bank's chairman was in trouble and the bank was on the brink of insolvency.  However, as the Wall Street Journal reports, it wasn't enough for 31-year-old Li Xu, who showed up for the third day Thursday to withdraw thousands of yuan from her mother's life savings.  after hearing from fellow villagers in Yishan Bank, which is the largest lender in Yishan County by the number of branches and capital.  She's also a member of the PBOC's deposit insurance system, according to local government.  Now, the deposit insurance system is bullshit.  It's like the FDIC.  The FDIC can handle one bank failure, not a big bank, but a small bank, a tiny bank, but they can't handle a system-wide failure.  It's like you opening up an insurance company and saying, I'll write any insurance policy you want, and you have no backing whatsoever.  Yeah, come on, Bank of America.  Come on, GE Capital.  Come on, all these companies.  I'll insure you.  It's just a piece of paper.  If there's nothing behind it, that's a problem.  Now, the theory is with state-run insurance that it's covered by the bank anyway because they can print money for free.  On one hand, that's true.  On another hand, it's not true because it's the contagion problem.  If they do it, then another insurance company will do it.  Another bank will do it.  Another and another and another and voila, you have infinite printing and nobody gets out of it.  All of a sudden, everybody rushes to the bank and you have bank runs like we have in this one today.  Just like any self-respecting Ponzi scheme, the bank's branch managers tried to persuade her to keep her money with them until March, when her mother's three-year deposits were mature, yielding more than $10,000 in interest.  And then, just like any Ponzi scheme to sweeten the offer, the bank managers also offered her even higher-yielding products, plus supermarket gift cards, just to keep her money there.  by deposit insurance, one female manager told her.  But Ms.  Li refused.  Her confidence in the states lies were crushed.  We really can't afford to lose them.  If you have any money in the bank, it will be gone.  Not in China, in the United States of America, in Australia, in Europe, you name it.  It will be gone at some point.  I do believe it has started.  I think it started September 11th.  And it's growing exponentially.  By mid-November, you're not going to even recognize the landscape.  So it is happening in China.  It's going to spread through Europe.  It's going to spread all over the place.  Because these banks don't trust each other anymore.  We don't know.  They don't tell us just how criminal they are.  But they know their own books.  And their own books are rehypothecated a thousand different times.  It's a complete fraud and it is going to blow within the next few weeks, most likely.  Listen to what Cliff High said on his full interview about timing.  Go to roadtour.com.  Go to the Friday road trip section for the private road members.  And you got a whole bunch of great stuff.  Where's Cliff High?  There it is.  Cliff High interview from Vegas.  This isn't the one I played in Vegas.  I played the highlights in Vegas.  This is the full one that explains how this shit's going to go down.  Awesome interview.  He's so cool and so smart.  And this is what his data said from the report, the Soaring 20s report, which is now coming true, actually.  All the shit he was saying two years ago has been moved forward two years, and now it's bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Hang on tight.  You got to get that report.  Go to Half Past Human.  It's a good one.  Or just listen to this interview.  How to get this interview, hit subscribe today and join the private road at Road to Ruta.  And you'll get a Vary token and a silver Ruta coin shipped to your front door.  Yes, I will stop giving Vary out as soon as it hits $20.  And it could run to $20 in an instant if the SEC comes back with a settlement with Veritasium.  I'd say any settlement.  Truthfully.  And it was supposed to happen before, I think, the second week in November.  So I will not, say, give last licks.  When it flies past $20 per Veritasium token, I'm stopping it.  So if you want a Veritasium token with your renewal or a new subscription, go to Road to Ruta, hit subscribe today, and do it.  Make it happen.  I haven't checked Veritasium today.  Last I looked, it was like $15.  But a month ago, it was at $22.23.  So the moment we're going to hear news, we're going to see some action in Veritasium, so hang on tight.  That's what I got for you right now.  Right now we're kind of in the middle of the road.  Cryptos don't know where to go.  They could slam down to zero with a computer click.  They could slam up to a million dollars of Bitcoin.  McAfee would win his bet.  We don't want to see what he's going to do if he loses, right?  Anyway, this is Bix, just keeping you in the loop.  I'm back in the office, so get ready tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow's Friday, so the Friday road trip for private road members.  I'm going to go over where we stand as far as these secret bailouts, and I've got the tally going.  And, yeah, the scary thing is I did a little one-month projection out to when they're going to have to come to Congress, and we're exactly right on it.  I put it out like three weeks ago.  Crazy stuff.  This is Bix, RoadToRoad.com.  Talk to you later. ",

Just a criminal.  And you'll get yours one day when the people find out they're gonna lock, lock, lock you away.  Hey, Mr.  Banker, I see what you're doing.  You're rigging markets higher.  Derivatives are brewing.  You tell us all it's different.  Gonna go up forever.  And secretly you're short-thinking.  You're so damn clever.
