            "text": "In 1729, Philadelphia passed a law allowing locals to deport homeless people.  This hostility was the general attitude that plagued colonial era vagrants and paupers who were considered to be morally deficient.  The first panhandling ordinances appeared in New York and Philly in the 1820s.  As for the South, slaves were considered to have homes no matter how dilapidated they were.  Meanwhile, whites assumed masterless free blacks were homeless.  which was tantamount to a crime, as they would then wonder if the free blacks were fugitives.  Speaking of runaway slaves, wrote Roberta Ann Johnson in her paper, African Americans and Homelessness, although textbooks that describe the history of American homeless do not include them, the large number of runaway slaves should be considered as an early example of American homelessness.  They lived in forests, mountains, and swamps of the South.  Some found refuge in native communities while others ended up north to face strict vagrancy laws, intensifying the searches for jobs.  The earliest New York City poorhouses in the mid-19th century also housed runaway slaves.  W.E.B.  Du Bois studied the records of places that housed the homeless in Philadelphia in 1837 and found that 14% of them were black and that there were more homeless black women than men.  During the Civil War, runaway slave numbers increased, and some found shelter in the Union army camps, though most didn't.  Millions of homeless freed people existed at the end of the war, and instead of land reform policies that would give former slaveholder territory to black people, a good chunk of the black community were renting from white land owners, or they were homeless migrant workers.  With little economic independence and white violence threatening where they could move, opportunities for home ownership and generational wealth were dashed.  Thousands of these migrant workers headed west to become cowboys, where they were also homeless, sleeping openly in the desert, and if lucky, sleeping in rented rooms.  When first used on American soil in the 1870s, the term homelessness described the people who traveled the country, riding the rails and looking for work.  Tramp was defined as all idle persons not having any visible means of support, wandering about and not giving a good account of themselves.  Homeless tramps were considered to be an emerging symbol of the moral crisis eroding the American home, though businesses that sprang up around freshly built train tracks needed them.  In fact, such tramps have been around since the early 19th century.  It was the Industrial Revolution, and more men, a lot of them immigrants, increasingly moved from rural farms and towns to big cities where the jobs were.  They only increased in number following the Civil War.  From 1873 to 1874, the American population was about 40 million people and roughly 3 million were considered to be tramps.  Sometimes they found work and sometimes they didn't.  These tramps were mostly young white men capable of physical labor and social reformers believed the solution was jobs, not housing.  The focus was on men, as a religious group noted that homelessness was a crisis of men let loose from all habits of domestic life, wandering without aim or home.  But of course, there were homeless women.  In New York, from 1874 to 1875, about 450,000 homeless people lived in police stations during the frigid winter months.  Homelessness was a local and state matter, not a federal one.  In 1892, Congress began investigating homelessness, but not much was done until the Great Depression, when building housing for low-income Americans became a priority.  Back during the first wave of the Great Migration, thousands of black people moved north to overcrowded and overpriced sections of cities like New York and Chicago, where they were constantly on the verge of homelessness.  By the winter of 1932 to 1933, nearly one quarter of Philadelphia's homeless transient were black, as were one-tenth of Chicago's sheltered men, one-fifth of Buffalo's transients, and one-sixth of New York City's public shelter clientele.  And these numbers would have been higher if not for the extensive kin network established among black people who were always taking in friends and family in need, even if it meant overcrowded beds and rooms.  Their homes were often inadequate, and they lived in dilapidated slums.  But the government's primary concern, in addition to these slums being an aesthetic blight for economic opportunities, was the thousands of homeless white people during the Great Depression.  Though there were black residents among their numbers, it was mainly white faces huddled into those hundreds of infamous Hoovervilles we've heard so much about in American history courses.  Many were from the Dust Bowl and fled unlivable conditions to find jobs and housing.  But in the South, about 192,000 black tenant farmers were forced off land due to production restrictions of the New Deal.  And they became migrant workers and day laborers.  Their desperate circumstances meant employers could pay them even less than what they did before the Depression.  For instance, in Georgia, migrant workers were pressured into going to Florida and New Jersey to work for as low as three cents per harvested field bag.  Though the New Deal included provisions for tenant farmers, local governments could dole out benefits as they saw fit, and it's no surprise that the racists usually provided more aid to white families.  As a result, black migrant workers, and sometimes their families, lived under tin or metal sheets or large trees, and such homelessness was thought to be the natural habitat of blacks.  An official from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration explained, It's no wonder that some black people turn to criminal activities such as running moonshine, running brothels, operating numbers games, and other stuff to make ends meet.  After World War II, Congress passed the Housing Act of 1949 to get a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.  By the 50s, cities like St.  Louis were planning for slum clearance and the erection of low-income housing like the Pruitt-Igoe projects, highly isolated buildings that later went neglected.  While such housing was given to minorities, the Federal Housing Authority Mortgage Program was only available for white families who could move into freshly built lily white suburbs with plentiful resources.  These suburbs didn't allow black residents.  Two thirds of the urban slums cleared out by cities were black, and in 41 cities, 60% of the tenants forced out of slums were moved into other slums.  By 1967, urban renewal had destroyed 400,000 homes and only 41,580 new housing units were built, contributing to homelessness.  This is where those extended family kinship networks again came in.  This would continue to be a prominent feature of the black community until the 80s, when friends and family were less likely to house crack addicts who were disproportionately homeless.  The loosening of kinship communities can also be explained by the migration of middle class blacks away from cities, in the process cutting off their homes from family members in need.  During the 70s, the economic crisis and deindustrialization meant a turn from industry jobs to service jobs.  43% of black people were blue collar workers compared to 35.5% of whites, meaning deindustrialization hit the black community especially hard.  In 1974, the Housing Choice Voucher Program, or Section 8, was unveiled.  But it wasn't until three years later that the federal government directly addressed homelessness with the Stuart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.  In addition to making provisions for federal money to be used on shelters and soup kitchens and created an agency on the homeless, the government finally defined homelessness.  It was later amended in 2009 and now defines homelessness as individuals and families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and includes a subset for an individual who is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less and who resided in an emergency shelter or a place not meant for human habitation immediately before entering that institution.  Individuals and families who will imminently lose their primary nighttime residence unaccompanied youth and families with children and youth who are defined as homeless under other federal statutes, who don't otherwise qualify as homeless under this definition, or individuals and families who are fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions that relate to violence against the individual or a family member.  Between 1979 and 1984, 44% of the net new jobs created paid poverty level wages, and over three quarters of the new jobs created during the 1980s were at minimum wage levels.  The modern era of homelessness began in the 1980s thanks to gentrification, unemployment rates, public housing budget cuts in the haze of the 1970s recession, and not enough affordable housing on the private market.  where developers try to outdo each other in catering expensive homes to the wealthy and affluent.  Since the 1980s, rent in metro areas across the country have outpaced wages.  But another issue that led to a more visible homeless population is the deinstitutionalization of mentally ill people.  In the 60s, civil liberty activists pushed for better lives for those who spent lifetimes in shitty psychiatric care centers by providing both new medication and community services.  In 1960, there were 535,000 mental health patients living full-time in state hospitals.  And by 1980, that number was 137,000.  But many governments didn't provide enough funding for programs to help these individuals live normal lives outside of psychiatric care centers.  And along with the decline of cheap housing, this meant more mentally ill people ended up in the streets or in shelters.  There were also cuts to supplemental security income benefits and stricter requirements for the disability eligibility process, further leading more people to the streets.  The typical homeless person of the 1980s was under 40, more likely to have health issues or substance addictions than previous generations, and were more poor.  Due to urban renewal, there were less rooming houses and skid rows for them to turn to.  In a US census report by George Carter III, in 1985, a gap of 4.54 million units existed between the number of low-income units and the number of low-income households, which became a 5.22 million unit gap by 1991.  4 million affordable units were lost from the housing market between 1970 and 1990 when the units were upgraded, converted to condos, or demolished.  This, along with the explosion of crack cocaine, exacerbated the rates of black homelessness, and black people became a bigger share of the total.  During the 90s, sociologists established three types of homelessness when studying the population in New York and Philadelphia.  80% were transient, meaning they had a single brief stay in a shelter.  10% were episodic, meaning they had repeated but brief stays.  10% were chronic.  More than 550,000 Americans are homeless on a typical night, and 1.4 million will spend time in a shelter during a given year.  Roughly 37% of the nation's homeless are black.  Native people also face high rates of homelessness.  Additionally, domestic violence victims, the mentally ill, substance abusers and veterans experience homelessness at higher rates than everyone else.  But also, experts criticize current counting methods and say the numbers of people living in homelessness are higher.  As one former librarian noted, The raging homelessness always impacts tax dollars.  Writing in a 2007 essay titled, What They Didn't Teach Us in Library School, Chip Ward wrote, cities that have tracked chronically homeless people for the police, jail, clinic, paramedic, emergency room, and other hospital services they require, estimate that a typical transient can cost taxpayers between 20,000 and 150,000 a year.  You couldn't design a more expensive, wasteful, or ineffective way to provide healthcare to individuals who live on the street than by having librarians like me dispense it through paramedics and emergency rooms.  The best proposed solution, along with affordable housing, are long-term subsidies that allow people to pay only 30% of their income towards rent on the private market, with the government making up the rest.  Not only would this be the moral and humane thing to do, it would be a hell of a win for public health.  Chip Ward continued in his essay, if an epidemic of deadly flu were to strike, if an easily communicable strain of tuberculosis or some other devastating disease emerges, Paramedics will be overwhelmed by their homeless clients who are at high risk for such illnesses.  People who drink until they pass out tend to aspirate and choke.  And people who sleep outdoors at night breathe cold, damp air.  People who sleep in crowded shelters breathe each other's air.  And if an epidemic strikes, the susceptibility of the homeless will translate into an increased risk of exposure for the rest of us.  And eerily enough, our public libraries could become ground zeros for the spread of killer flu.  It's not just about libraries.  The chronically homeless share bus stops, subways, park benches, handrails, restrooms, drinking fountains, and fast food booths with us, or with others we encounter daily, who also share the air we breathe and the services we touch.  When sick or drunk, they vomit in public restrooms if we are lucky.  Having a population that is at once vulnerable to disease and able to spread microbes widely to others is simply foolish and unnecessary public policy.
