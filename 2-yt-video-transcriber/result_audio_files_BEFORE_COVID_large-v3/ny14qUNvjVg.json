            "text": "My life changed once companies started polluting the streets of my city with the greatest invention since cassette tapes, scooters for rent.  And for me, a scooter isn't just a mode of transportation, it's a way of life.  And some people aren't happy about it.  They say the scooters clutter up the sidewalks and make the city look trashy.  Well, you know what?  I can go faster on this piece of trash than any other trash in this city.  I feel like the king of the world when I'm on a scooter.  And they're completely safe.  The most annoying thing about people riding scooters on sidewalks is the people walking on the sidewalks.  They're slowing me down.  Inconsiderate jerks holding up scooter traffic.  Why don't you people walk on the road where you belong?  Agree to wear a helmet so I can activate this thing?  Yes, of course I'll wear a helmet.  I've got mine right here, right next to all my repelling gear because I'm in the middle of a city.  Scooters are for everybody.  Any middle-aged person with no balance and an athletic ability that makes them seem like a foreign stranger inside their own body can drive their head right into the side of a building or even get where they want to go if they're lucky, which I hope they're not.  It's just more entertaining that way.  It's important to be safe while you ride, so you always want to swerve erratically because it's more fun that way while assuming no one's coming up from behind you.  Always assume people walking in front of you that you're about to pass aren't going to turn.  If they do, they deserve to get hit because they didn't use their blinker.  And it's always best to function outside the box of normal traffic laws and make your own rules.  There's a universal law that says when you don't need a scooter, there will be at least 49 of them within eyesight.  But when you do need a scooter because you got to get somewhere, they all somehow vanish.  Just like ferries when you look at them.  I don't just stand on a scooter like a zombie.  Only dorks do that.  I'm all about being high performance on a scooter.  If you see me launch off a six inch curb, just know I am feeling pretty good about myself.  And yes, I do feel like a daredevil.  Whenever I'm scootering with my wife, we're always racing.  Even though she doesn't know she's racing me, I take the race very seriously.  Who's gonna get to the next crosswalk first?  You better believe it's me.  What I hate more than world hunger is when I'm going out with a friend and we're going to get there by scooter and we find scooters. ",

And then six and a half minutes into our ride, an unexpected chunk of raised sidewalk causes my friend to take a header right into a light pole and he fractures his skull.  He should have just Ubered.  You get a wide variety of experiences, even within the same scooter brand.  One will move you along at an unnerving 20 miles an hour, and then the next scooter functions like an abused red-headed stepchild.  Which I am, so I would know.  When you're done with your scooter, just gently put it at the edge of a sidewalk and take a picture of it to close out your ride.  I typically end up taking a picture of a different scooter after I courteously discard mine.  It's not exactly an airtight system.  The end of the night is when I get the most depressed.  Most scooters have dead batteries from a day full of people using them and then an evening full of drunk people breaking their collarbones on them as they go from one bar to the next.  At the worst of times, I have to revert back to the Stone Age and Uber home.  I always hate myself a little bit when I do.  And the good people at all the scooter companies give you the opportunity to quit your day job and step into a life of luxury by becoming a charger and earning some extra cash.  So yeah, the scooter culture has given my life convenience and purpose.  At least until major lawsuits shut all the scooter companies down and my city bans them. ",
