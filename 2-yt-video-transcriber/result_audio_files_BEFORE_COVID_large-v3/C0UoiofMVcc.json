            "text": "Hey guys, it's Joel Palaciumble here, and today, I'm here for my final video.  What?!  Your final  video?!  Oh my god, we need to sound the alarms!  Red alert!  Oh, Benga.  You know that if I left YouTube, no one would miss me.  But no, this isn't my final video ever.  It's not my final video, period.  This is only my final video of the 2010s.  Oh.  Good.  You're not quitting YouTube.  Hooray.  So, today we're talking about Jack Ruby, the man who killed Lee Harvey Oswald.  And if you don't know who Lee Harvey Oswald was, then get off my channel.  But if you really don't know who Lee Harvey Oswald was, he was the man who killed U.S.  President John F. Kennedy in 1963.  And Jack Ruby was the man who killed Lee Harvey Oswald, who was the man who killed John F. Kennedy.  Alright, begin.  Now, before I begin, I would like to clarify my own stance on Jack Ruby and his decision to kill Lee Harvey Oswald.  I believe that, at least on some part, Jackery was justified in killing John F. Kennedy because he had just murdered someone.  I think that's the big part.  And in doing so, he had sent the entire nation of America into crisis.  So I believe that it was ultimately a good idea to have him killed.  Oh yeah?  Well, I say the Jack Ruby didn't go far enough.  He should have boiled Lee Harvey Oswald the octopus alive.  Jacob Leon Rubenstein was born on March 25th, 1911.  Now, while I say that, it is important to note that his actual birth date isn't known, but it was likely March 25th, and it's definitely 1911.  So he was born to Polish immigrants and raised in a Jewish family, and while little information can be found about his father, it is known that his mother was severely mentally ill, and as such he had a very unstable upbringing, and from 1923 to 1924 he had to live in foster care.  So Jacob Rubenstein dropped out of high school when he was 16 and started working various odd jobs, often which those jobs that he worked weren't under any specific employer.  One example was he once, one of his jobs was taking tickets that weren't sold for events where tickets were already supposedly sold out and selling them.  He was a ticket scalper.  After briefly serving the military in the late 1940s, during which he changed his name from Jacob Rubinstein to Jack Ruby, he left the military and started operating various nightclubs, only a few of which got anywhere close to being successful.  On November 22nd, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald killed John F. Kennedy, who was the president at the time, and Jack Ruby was so enraged by this news that he went to Dallas, Texas, where the assassination took place, and killed Lee Harvey Oswald by shooting him in the stomach, saying that he did it to protect John F. Kennedy's wife, Jacqueline.  He shot him in the stomach?  Yeah.  Oof.  Banga.  Did you just, unironically, say, oof?  Uh, uh, uh, no, no, please don't put me in my cage.  Oh, Banga, don't worry, I'll just slap you until you're bloody.  Anyways, Jack Ruby died of cancer on January 3rd, 1967, ending his life.  So, I hope you enjoyed the video, I hope you learned something, and I hope you have a nice weekend. ",
