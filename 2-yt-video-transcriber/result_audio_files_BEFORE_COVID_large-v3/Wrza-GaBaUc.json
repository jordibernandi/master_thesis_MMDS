There are what I can most charitably call plot holes, the kinds of things I'd never accept in a TV show or movie, let alone a religious text.  I mean, come on, Star Wars fans have had a hard time accepting that the Imperials didn't shoot down the escape pod with R2 and Threepio in it, life forms or no life forms, and Christians want us to accept these gaping plot holes?  We already don't believe.  Why would we start if we can spot some pretty obvious flaws that would make the average moviegoer go, Yeah, right.  But when I ask these to explain them, I have never had a satisfying answer.  It's always, God works in mysterious ways, or worse, just cuz.  And frankly, that ain't good enough.  If you want me to even start considering your religion as more than just legend, poorly written legend, you're gonna have to step up to the plate and patch those rips.  Start near the beginning.  God doesn't want Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, right?  But they go and do it anyway.  Tricked by a snake or not, that bit's not important.  And that lets evil into the world, right?  If they don't know good and evil, right and wrong, how could Adam and Eve have a conscience?  How could they know that disobeying is even wrong?  God said no, but doing it anyway isn't a huge deal to them, right?  Two, why would God even let them get to the tree in the first place?  Wacky idea.  How about a fence?  An electrified fence with spikes and barbed wire at the top.  A fence that goes 100 feet underground, which Adam and Eve would need a bulldozer to make a tunnel.  What about that?  Once they ate from the tree, why did the punishment have to be eternal?  Why inherited?  Was that apple full of moral herpes?  Why couldn't God just give them a slap on the wrist, make them stand in the corner, and then poof away the sin with a finger snap?  I mean, he could, couldn't he?  Quatro, why a sacrifice on the cross?  Was death the only way to get rid of sin?  Again, why not just magic words plus a finger snap to get rid of it?  Yeah, yeah, sacrificed himself for us, loved us that much, yada yada.  That's not my question.  I'm not asking motivation, I'm questioning the method.  F-f-f-five, why are we still told that we're born sinful?  I thought Jesus' death was supposed to get rid of sin.  Is it just that now we can be redeemed and not go to hell?  But if that's true, what about the poor fuckers who died before Jesus committed suicide by proxy?  Roku, why wait so long to have Jesus die to redeem us?  Allegedly, thousands of years go by before God gets this brilliant idea about getting his son murdered to save us all.  Did it really take him that long to figure it out?  Eight, why even have hell?  How much can he love us if that's even a possibility?  Nine, why is faith so damned important?  Couldn't God reveal his existence without any doubt and then tell us to behave ourselves?  Why isn't it our behavior that matters rather than belief without evidence going only on feelings?  Parents and lawmakers don't need to be invisible for us to be good little boys and girls.  So what the hell's God's thinking on this one?  Make it make sense.  10.  Can I have a cookie?  I want a cookie.  Seriously, these are questions that have been asked over and over with not a satisfying answer to be found.  I think you expect too much of us.  I need more than just-cause answers before I can take your religion seriously.  I haven't said it for a while, but one major reason I'm not religious is because the Christian PR department has badly screwed up their advertising campaign.  The Bible could have used a few proofreaders before it was released.  Until next time, fellow space travelers, this is Bionic Dance saying don't run on automatic.  Instead, please think.  I mean, come on.  Star Wars fans have had a... I mean, come on.  Star Wars fans have had a... Fuck me.  If you want me to even start considering your... Considering your... Considering...

If they didn't know good and evil, right and wrong, how could I... Is it just that now we can be redeemed and not... That was supposed to be six.  Fuck, I hit the mic.
