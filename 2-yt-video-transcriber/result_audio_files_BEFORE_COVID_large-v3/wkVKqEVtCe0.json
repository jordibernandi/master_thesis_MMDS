And now more and more people are, Jews are coming to the knowledge of Yeshua, just as it was prophesied, the closer we get to the coming of the Lord.  And you can turn on the TV.  You can see dozens of other Messianic Jewish ministries, Jewish ministries proclaiming the truth.  And this is a good thing.  We're excited about this.  But Zola Levitt Ministries wants to do more.  We want to reach more people.  We want to expand our message.  And changing our name is just one way of doing that. ",

Our Jewish roots is going to enable people to right off the bat understand what our purpose and intent is.  Guys, this isn't changing the message.  It isn't changing what we do.  It isn't changing how we do it.  The same purpose is established 40 years ago is present today.  We're just trying to make it more available to more people.  And we're reaching new people now, right?

When Greece was overtaking the world with Alexander the Great, and he was subjugating nations, he commanded the language of Greek to become the common tongue.  People started speaking it.  Well, the Romans come afterwards.  and the Romans expand their reach further throughout the globe, and they subjugate people, they persecute people, high tax burdens, but they also create a system of roads to reach everywhere across the empire.  All of this created an environment that was ripe for the gospel.  So when Yeshua, He called the Great Commission, He said, go out and preach the gospel to every creature, The world was ready.  The disciples could go north, south, east, and west on these roadways.  The people were hungry.  They were starving from persecution, ready for the gospel.  They could speak to them in Greek.  Everybody understood the common tongue, could know the message, the good news of Yeshua.  And now today, with this advancement in technology, the whole world is connected through your phone.  All around the world, we can hear people's messages, see videos in moments through Twitter, through Facebook, through YouTube.  We know that we can use this technology to reach more people.  We're spreading our nets wider.  as we know the harvest has come, the great end times harvest.  And we are all fellow laborers working as one Messiah for the message to be preached before the end comes. ",

Behold, I will do a new thing.  Now it shall spring forth.  Shall you not know it?  I will even make a road in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people, my chosen.  This people I have formed for myself, they shall declare my praise.  Guys, don't get caught up in the former ways just because they're the former ways.  Remember that the ways had a purpose and the purpose is the message.  We're presenting the same message we always have.  We're presenting it in the new way that the Lord's placed in our hearts.
