I'm here with Dr.  Ross, and Hugh, there are a couple of creatures in the book of Job that I would like to know more about.  That is Leviathan and the behemoth.  Now, these sound like really scary animals with bones like bronze, and they breathe fire, and Are these actual living creatures, or are they something mythological that the writer made up? ",

If you read the description of the behemoth, it's clearly not a carnivore.  It's a vegetarian.  But when you get close to it, it gets territorial.  It's going to do you some damage.  I've been to Africa several times, and I've noticed that the crocodiles like to hang around the hippos.  Because they know that people are not going to be able to see the hippos.  They kind of submerge themselves in muddy water.  So they're hard to see.  But when you come into their territory, they're going to capsize your boat.  And the crocodiles get lunch. ",

Like, say, if the mother hippo dies in birth and then humans raise that baby hippo, the hippo will bond with the humans and they can become the pet.  But it's extraordinarily difficult to tame it.  That's about the only way you're going to do it.  Same thing with a crocodile.  The only way you're going to tame it is to take it the moment it comes out of its egg.  You want to handle it every day and you don't want to miss a day.  That's how difficult it is to tame.  And there's very few of these creatures that have ever been tamed.  But notice how the book Job ends.  It says, notice it takes a higher being to tame these creatures.  Likewise, it takes a higher being to tame us.  Because it says, there's one animal you've never been able to tame.  You've not been able to bring humility to a proud human heart.  Just like it takes a higher being to tame the hippo, it takes a higher being to tame the human being, and some of us are more challenging to tame worms.  Some of us are like the crocodile and the bee of it.  And I think what confuses people is how frequently Job, in those two texts, 40 and 41, uses the word as and like.  So it's highly metaphorical.  And some of what you're reading there is giving you a literal description of these animals.  Other passages are giving you a metaphorical description.  21 times you see the words like and as.  And the metaphor is describing how you're going to feel if you have a close encounter with one of those wild creatures.  That creature might as well be breathing fire and smoke for all the good a stick is going to do in your hand to defend yourself.  It might as well have bones of bronze.  for all the good a rock in your hand is going to do to defend yourself in a close encounter with these creatures.  It's describing how you're going to feel in a close encounter. ",

It's only going to use vocabulary that all generations can comprehend.  So Neanderthals aren't mentioned, protons aren't mentioned, and dinosaurs aren't mentioned, but here's where they fit in the Bible.  Psalm 104, it's a property of all life to die off, but God recreates and renews the face of the earth.  If you look at all of Psalm 104, it's talking about God packing the earth with as much life as possible, as diverse as possible.  If you want dinosaurs, you have to have very large shallow seas.  You need that water to support their bodies.  The only way you can have a creature that massive.  So when the earth had those shallow seas, God created dinosaurs, packed the earth with dinosaurs.  But notice we don't have big shallow seas today.  biggest animal you can have on land is the elephant. ",
