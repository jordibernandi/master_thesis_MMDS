            "text": "Hello, viewer.  You may be asking yourself, Jake, why are you wearing that corn hat?  It's irrelevant, and I refuse to answer the question.  The real reason that we're here is not to discuss my fashion sense or lack thereof, but rather to discuss my charity event that will be running today, Tuesday, July 30th.  until tomorrow at the same time.  24 straight hours of me sitting in front of a camera debasing myself for your entertainment.  But not just your entertainment.  also for charity.  We're going to do a charity for Trans Lifeline.  Trans Lifeline is dedicated to improving the quality of trans lives by responding to the critical needs of the community with direct service, material support, advocacy, and education.  They have the vision to fight the epidemic of trans suicide and improve overall life outcomes of trans people by facilitating justice-oriented collective community aid.  This is a thing the trans community deserves and needs, especially at a time like this when maybe people that are in charge of the government don't look as favorably on certain portions of our country.  But that's not all.  On top of giving maybe a dollar or more to a really, really worthwhile charity, there's also going to be lots of guests, people that you may have heard of.  A certain Hugo.  Have you ever heard of Hugo?  Probably.  But actually many other guests, many streamers, many YouTubers that you'd definitely like.  I'm going to watch some Bigfoot things.  If you're into Bigfoot, there's going to be corn.  That's a thing now, apparently.  I'm probably going to end up dying my hair.  I don't even know what's going to happen.  24 hours is going to go by.  I'm going to be absolutely crazy and I will need you there.  to keep me awake so all you have to do is in the description or in your browser yourself.  if you're feeling froggy go to twitch.tv.  slash actual jake when i wake up tuesday morning.  well let's be fair tuesday afternoon because i'm a sack of shit.  I will start streaming almost immediately for 24 straight hours.  Nothing will stop me.  I will literally be here for 24 hours advocating for Trans Lifeline.  There is a GoFundMe link already available.  That is also in the description, so if you just want to get a head start, go for it.  Every donation is wonderful.  I don't need to be online for you to donate.  But I really genuinely would like your help staying awake for the 24 hours.  I'd like your help sharing this.  Even if it's just this video, I would like you to share it during the stream.  Hopefully you can stop in at least once or twice during the day.  If you want to, some people are saying they're gonna try to stay the whole time with me.  So we'll see what happens.  The guests have no timetable.  They'll show up when they show up.  If you don't want to miss anybody, I suggest having it on at least in the background.  so if you hear somebody is coming on, you can tune in.  Tell your friends, share the video.  When we go live, share the stream, share the charity link.  And by the way, all the donations I get during this, if they come personally to me and don't go to the GoFundMe, all of that also going to the charity at a later date.  Because it takes Twitch like a month to process stuff.  But we will be sending all of that over to Trans Lifeline as well.  So I think that's it.  If you need any more questions answered, tune into the stream and I can answer them live.  I'm usually pretty good about that.  So I hope to see you there.  If you're not there, at least please think about giving a dollar to the charity below.  And I love you guys.  Have a good day.  Thank you. ",
