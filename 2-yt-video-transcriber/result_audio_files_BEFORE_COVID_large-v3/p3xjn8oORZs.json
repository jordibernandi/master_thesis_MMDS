Actually, you probably can't turn him specifically.  He seemed pretty far gone.  But at least according to this admittedly anecdotal article by Raw Story, a few Trump supporters have started to rethink their support after being duped by his tax plan.  A tax plan that he touted during the State of the Union last night. ",

            "text": "Tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts.  Trump was trying to emphasize that with his base, a base that was beginning to fray during the government shutdown.  But that may not be the right move because as people start getting their W-2s back and as tax season rolls around, Trump supporters are beginning to realize that they aren't getting the return on their Trump investment that they anticipated.  Pretty par for the course with him.  Dennis Jordan says, Another Twitter user, Wait till you file your taxes.  Middle class just lost half their return.  Lowest refund I have ever had.  and I am 50 years old.  No wall.  and now this tax reform sucks too.  Starting to doubt Trump.  I voted for him and trusted him too.  And another from Joel Serban.  Thank you for screwing the middle class with your tax reform.  I have never in my life, I'm 49 years old, had to pay into the IRS until this year.  We have a combined income of 150K.  The middle class voted for you.  I will not make the same mistake twice.  And while this is just Twitter evidence, the numbers bear it out.  Trump's tax cuts lost popularity quickly in the summer and continued to dip, ending as less popular than the conservative boogeyman, Obamacare.  An internal poll commissioned by the Republican National Committee found that 61% of all respondents thought the tax cuts benefited large corporations and rich Americans over middle-class families.  just 30% said the reverse.  That 30% probably has a big crossover with Trump's base.  And now, from the anecdotal evidence provided by Raw Story, it seems like even Trump's base doesn't buy that these tax cuts were good for Americans, which is a fact, because as of August 2018, tracking by Americans for Tax Fairness showed that only about 400 out of America's 5.9 million employers have announced any wage increases or one-time bonuses related to the tax cuts.  That's about 0.007%.  So keep touting those tax cuts, Republicans, because for most of the country, their positive effects are non-existent. ",
