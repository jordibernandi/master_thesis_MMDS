            "text": "what is going on?  guys it's sydney here coming to you from prague in the czech republic and i have a story here for you from australia.  now this story is titled total swipe out.  i swiped through so many men on tinder.  i was told there were no matches left and i'm still single.  and i thought to myself you know From what I've seen of women on Tinder, it's really not that hard for them to meet someone.  The girls think that they've got a hard time on Tinder.  Hey, they should try being a dude, right?  Unless you're a crazy good looking dude, in which case you'll have no problem picking up all the girls in the world.  But that's not going to work out too well for the girls because there's like 20 of you and one of him.  So, but that's another story.  Anyway, let's get into it.  A woman claims to have swiped through so many men on Tinder, she was told there were no matches left.  And I'm not talking about she's just swiped through a heap of guys in a very small age range in a very small area.  She's literally swiped through almost everybody on Tinder on the planet.  Well, at least in the country she's swiped in.  Andy Liu, 46, a wellness coach from Australia, even started pin dropping to other places and countries.  I bet you pin dropped in Congo, didn't you, Andy?  In her bid to... Miggy started laughing.  In her bid to find love.  Congo, Naija, and Chad, for those of you who follow my community tab.  Andy has been searching for the one, both on offline and on dating apps for the past six years.  So she's been swiping for six years and hasn't been able to find anyone.  Wow, I wonder who the common denominator is there, Andy.  and signed up to Tinder when it first launched.  She initially had some success telling female, that's F-E-M-A-I-L for the Daily Mail, I ended up having a relationship with one guy I fell madly in love with until he had to go back to Sweden.  Unfortunately, she had to break off, break things off as she knew she could never live there full time.  She continues, the other matches I met, I just met and we became amazing friends.  Sushi friends earned them.  Now, to give you a bit of an idea about what the Swedish dude looks like, you know, the guy that she fell madly in love with.  Well, he's a Chad.  Look at the body on that.  All right.  So I hope that focuses are right there.  Being a health and wellness coach, you can imagine she's not going to settle for anything less than an absolute rig.  Andy's experiences have led her to write a book entitled Hashtag Insta Lovers, which is about digital dating and direct messaging disasters.  Yeah, sounds like she's had a few of those.  During a recent press tour in the US, the... wait for it... Mum of one.  Yeah, that's right.  She's a single mum.  It's all starting to fall together now, isn't it, people?  Decided to revisit apps because there was nobody left in Melbourne that she felt like she wanted to meet or date.  So basically, she didn't feel like she wanted to meet or date any of the people that she came across in Melbourne, even though she would have literally had to swipe through tens of thousands of dudes on Tinder to basically run out of swipes in the game.  She explains... If you reach the end of the app, a message will pop up saying there's no one new in your area, at which point you need to widen your area and age range.  Andy even ended up dating men in their 20s and 30s while in her early 40s because she found men of a similar age to her in Melbourne were already married.  Well, imagine my shock.  She's now given up on Tinder and is currently on Bumble, Hinge and Raya, which is an app for celebrities.  Yeah, Andy, hate to break it to you, sweetheart.  You're not a celebrity.  You never will be.  And even if you are, you'll be a C-grade celebrity at best.  So guys, what do you think of this story?  I want to get your feedback in the comments below.
