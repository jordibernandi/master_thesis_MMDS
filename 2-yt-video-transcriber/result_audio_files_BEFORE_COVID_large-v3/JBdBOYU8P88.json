            "text": "Today we are going to break down Jim Jordan's examination of Maria Bonavich in the context of the Trump impeachment inquiry hearings.  Yes.  VivaFry, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber.  I do these things called vlogs just to lay the context for anyone who may be so fortunate as to be living in a political bubble, which I am going to pop right now.  An impeachment inquiry has been commenced against Donald Trump to determine whether or not the House is going to formally approve articles of impeachment that they would then submit to the Senate for vote.  In the context of this impeachment inquiry, there have been examinations both behind closed doors and public.  Incidentally, I just did a video of Representative Quigley's examination of Kenton Taylor.  I'll link that video right here.  And in the comment section of that video, I noticed a few people asking if I was going to do a similar breakdown of a Republican examination of one of the witnesses.  Bringing this back to the practice of law, Jim Jordan would be one of those lawyers that you hate, but you respect.  He is harsh, he is direct, he's usually to the point, and he's the type of lawyer that would give you a hard time.  You would hate him for it, but you would respect him for it.  Last week, in the context of the public hearings, he was examining Marie Yovonovich.  And just to explain who Maria Ivanovich is and what role she plays in the context of the impeachment inquiry, Maria Ivanovich was the U.S.  ambassador to Ukraine from 2016 to 2019.  In 2019, she was abruptly recalled as U.S.  ambassador, I believe sometime in May, and the explanation she gave is that she was the object of a smear campaign.  because she refused to play ball in what she describes as Giuliani's attempt to strong-arm Ukraine into acceding to Trump's demand to open up a politically motivated investigation into Hunter Biden and Burisma.  So that is the context and object, so to speak, of Yovanovitch's testimony in the context of this impeachment inquiry.  An interesting fact that I learned from the comments section of my previous video of Representative Quigley's examination of Bill Taylor and George Kent is the distinction between Ukraine and the Ukraine as far as terms go.  Now, I was not previously aware of this, which is part of the reason why I love the Internet so much, is the aggregate knowledge of the Internet basically is infinite.  I mean, in a way, the aggregate awfulness of the Internet is equally infinite, but I prefer to focus on the good.  A lot of people in the comments section were pointing out that the term the Ukraine is actually how Russia used to refer to the territory during Soviet times.  Now that Ukraine is an independent nation, it is called Ukraine and not the Ukraine, although the terms are often interchangeably used by people who don't know better.  Thanks to the aggregate knowledge of the internet, I now know better and will hithertofore refer to Ukraine as Ukraine.  It's actually quite fitting since my grandmother's family actually came from Ukraine, but enough about me, let's get into this deposition.  Love him or hate him, Jim Jordan is one of the best and sharpest examiners out there.  So when he has an off day or says something silly, it sticks out a little more.  And I humorously parodied his jab at Adam Schiff with a Jerry Springer moment.  But at least in the practice of law, that type of Quiggling among lawyers really doesn't resonate well with judges, but we'll get there.  Let's start from the beginning. ",

The cardinal rule of a good examination is never asking a question to which you do not know the answer.  With one exception, when either answer the witness gives will be equally damning.  Should ambassadors ever try to influence the host country's election?  And despite not knowing exactly what answer the witness is going to give, Jim Jordan knows that either answer will be damning for the witness.  I mean, if Yovanovitch actually answers yes, ambassadors should try to influence the elections in host countries, I mean, it would be disastrous from the get-go.  Jim Jordan knows with reasonable certainty that she's going to answer no or a qualified no, a no with a but, and he is prepared for that answer.  No. ",

            "text": "I think you said in your opening statement, partisanship of this type is not compatible with the role of a career foreign service officer, is that right?  But that's exactly what happened in 2016.  In August of 2016, the very month you went to Ukraine as our ambassador, the Ukrainian ambassador here in the United States, Ambassador Cholli, wrote an op-ed in The Hill, said this, Trump's comments send wrong message.  So the very month you're over there as our ambassador to Ukraine, Ambassador Cholli writes that op-ed.  And it wasn't just that attack, as Mr.  Castor got into earlier.  It wasn't just that attack on the president.  We had former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, who criticized candidate Trump.  We had Mr.  Ivakov.  I believe earlier you said, Ambassador, that Mr.  Ivakov was the individual who first alerted you to the efforts of Mr.  Giuliani.  Mr.  Ivakov, back during this same time period, in the months just prior to the 2016 election, called  Mr.,  or excuse me, called then-candidate Trump all kinds of names, called him a terrorist.  And of course, we have Mr.  Leshchenko, a member of Parliament, who was a source for Fusion GPS and the now somewhat famous dossier that flowed from Fusion's work.  He said this in the Financial Times, again, in August of 2016, when you first arrive in Ukraine, he said this, the majority of Ukrainians, the majority of Ukrainian politicians are on Hillary Clinton's side.  So you had several high-ranking officials in the government, in the Ukrainian government, and President Poroshenko is president of Ukraine, criticize President Trump, then-candidate Trump, all in the late summer and fall of 2016.  What I want to know, Ambassador, when this was all happening, did you go talk to anyone in the Ukrainian government about this?  Did you go say to... Some of these officials, hey, you guys, you guys need to knock this off.  This perception that we got, as Mr.  Leshchenko said, the majority of Ukrainian politicians on Hillary Clinton's side, that's not good.  Did you have that conversation? ",

            "text": "No.  In previous vlogs, I had noted that these congressional hearings usually involve a lot of grandstanding on both sides.  And we are almost two minutes into Jim Jordan's line of questioning, and I know a ton of people out there are screaming at the screen, this is just a bunch of grandstanding.  And they're not necessarily wrong.  And I also know there's gonna be a ton of people screaming at the computer screen, this is a whataboutism, nobody cares about what happened in 2016, this is about 2019, not about Hillary 2016.  And they're not necessarily wrong.  But there does seem to be a method to Jim Jordan's madness.  He starts off the examination with a question to which there can really only be one acceptable answer.  And the witness gave that appropriate answer.  He then goes on for a minute and a half to two minutes citing examples of ambassadors who were ostensibly interfering in US elections.  What this all has to do with the Trump impeachment inquiry we'll get to in a second.  But he goes through a number of examples of what he frames as foreign ambassadors interfering in US elections.  He states it as a fact and puts it to the witness, who then has to answer that question on the basis of those facts that he has spent one and a half to two minutes inserting into the question.  And he asks Yovanovitch whether or not she talked to anybody about the assumed fact in his question that there was in fact interference with the US elections, and she says no. ",

He asks Jovanovic if she talked to anybody about the apparent Ukrainian interference in US elections.  If she says yes, it confirms the problem.  If she says no as she does it implicitly, it acknowledges the problem.  He has put Jovanovic in an impossible situation with the framing of that question.  What Jovanovic could have done is sort of deny or undermine the basis. ",
