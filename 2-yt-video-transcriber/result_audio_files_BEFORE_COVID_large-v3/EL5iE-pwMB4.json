            "text": "Trump's a con man.  No, he's not.  You know what?  My checks are bigger now.  My checks, I'm a worker.  I am the working class.  I am who he's standing for.  What about the 14,000 lines?  Hold on, I'm talking to him.  Doesn't matter.  What about his tax cuts for the wealthy?  My check.  My check.  He said he's a cool man.  I'm talking to him.  He said he's a cool man.  He's seated to me.  I'm telling you.  You don't want to talk to him because you don't want to answer the question.  I don't want to talk to you.  Because the question scares you.  No, this is how a real democracy works.  The question scares you.  Okay, listen.  What about 14,000 lives?  I don't care, man.  What's 14,000 lives?  I don't care, man.  What about the 55,000 million lives that your party is aborting?  I don't stand on that.  You didn't understand what I said.  You are a liar.  I haven't even addressed that yet.  I did.  Why are you telling me I'm a liar?  I'm not even talking to you.  I didn't.  Sir, you're asking me.  Why Trump is making my life better?  My life is better because my checks every two weeks.  What about his tax cuts for the 1%?  What about Trump's tax cuts for the 1%?  I got tax cuts.  My checks are bigger every two weeks, plus my tax return was still the same that it was under Obama.  So I got that money.  Again.  I'm speaking about the 1%.  What do you think about tax?  If you say Trump is for working class Americans, what about those tax cuts for the 1%?  For the 1%?  The 1% that create the jobs?  I have my job.  Listen to me.  I have my job.  Don't touch my microphone.  Okay, well listen to me.  I have my job because that 1% gave me a job.  They invested money to build a clinic that I now work in.  I work in this clinic and make money for myself.  So yes, I am for them getting breaks because they make more jobs.  for American people like me to work.  Top three wealthiest Americans make more than the bottom 50%.  What do you have to say about that?  You, honestly, when it comes down to it, you have what you work for.  It is up to you to either work or you don't.  The poor people, they're poor because they don't work.  Guess what?  I'm doing okay.  Especially under Trump, I'm doing okay.  And that's all that matters to me.  These poor people need to get a job.  The rich people, they're the ones that give jobs.  They're the ones that can actually build a restaurant to hire servers.  It takes money for that.  That doesn't come from the government.  The government doesn't give us that.  The tax breaks that the rich get that can actually go back to creating jobs, give people like me that are willing to work a job.  The people that aren't willing to work, you know what?  They need to get a job.  Sir, I've traveled around the country and spoken to homeless people who are working two and three jobs.  What do you say to those people?  Get a job?  They have three jobs.  I call bullshit, for one, because the thing is, is that if... I've seen them with my own two eyes.  I've interviewed them.  I work in the most expensive county to live in in the nation, and I make it.  So if I can make it, anybody else can.  The statistics do not vary.  In New Mexico.  I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Santa Fe, New Mexico is an expensive county, and guess what?  I make it, and I'm here.  So as long as you're making it, you don't care about those struggling Americans who are homeless, living on the street, earning under $15 minimum wage?  I care about them, but guess what?  All they have to do is get a better job.  That's what I did, and guess what?  I did it.  I didn't have to get an education.  I didn't have to follow the Democrat little policy of being on a plantation.  I got a job, and I did it myself.  These people have jobs.  They are doing it themselves.  The fact is that the income, the wealth in our country is all locked up in the top 1%.  What's Trump going to do about that?  I think you're just talking in circles, and I don't think you know anything, and I think you need to check the Democrats' record and see what they do for poor people, because what do they do?  What did Obama do for them?  You answer me.  Obama didn't do anything for them.  I am not an Obama fan.  You're not answering the question, though.  Does that mean you're not willing to?  I answered your question.  You asked me what I thought of the 1%.  You just keep going back to the fact that you're okay.  I'm fine with the 1% getting their tax breaks because the 1% gave me the job that I have now.  And guess what?  I flew from Santa Fe to here.  I'm here for a week.  Guess what?  That is my riches.  And you know what?  If somebody else wants to waste their money on whatever they're wasting it on, that's up to them.  But guess what?  They're not going to live off of me.  The evidence does not bear out that people are wasting their money and that's why they're poor.  You're spouting things that are not fact.  You can talk in all the circles you want.  You're playing yourself.  The reason why we spend so much time talking to you is because you make no sense.  And they're going to put this up and show that you make no sense.  And you do?  No, you don't.  Ask me a question.  He doesn't even know what he's talking about.  He can't even ask a question.  Ask me a question.  Ask him a question.  Ask him a question.  What's your evidence that I am fake news?  Fake news.  What's your evidence?  So all media is fake news?  You're all fake news.  Every single media.  Show me one homeless that has three jobs.  I'd be happy to.  You can go to our channel at statuscoup.com and you can see those homeless that have three jobs.  And I'll just see more fake news because, honestly, that's fake news.  You will see real Americans talking about their real problems and working extremely hard just like you work.  And they are not succeeding because that is not the way our country is set up systemically.  Well, maybe they need to learn how to manage their money because I'm not rich.  I don't have a lot of money.  But guess what?  I saved up and I was able to \u2013 I don't have any kids.  I'm on my own.  I'm on my own.  And guess what?  And what?  And what?  Yeah, what?  Yeah, what?  And you want to tell me about pro-choice too, don't you?  No, we weren't even talking pro-choice.  We weren't even talking pro-choice.  Clearly we're not going to get any answers here.
