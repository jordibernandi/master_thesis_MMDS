            "text": "Hello there.  Today is January 4th, 2020 and I am going to court in roughly two hours.  I'm going to be taking a Lyft slash Uber there because quite frankly I don't want him seeing my car or anyone to see my car or license plate number just because I'm paranoid.  and the way US works is if you got my license plate number you can find out where I live and like my parents and all that stuff.  So I'm just on the side of precaution and safety.  But for those of you who don't know, I am going to court.  because Onision filed a protective order against me.  No, I am not being sued.  I am being summoned basically by the court to have a public hearing as Onision makes his case for me quote unquote cyber-stalking him and harassing him.  Which is very very ironic considering the amount of emails that he has sent me Challenging me to debate him challenging me to a boxing match and even at one point in November of 2019 thanking me for not including photos of His kiddos in my videos.  what he wrote on the paperwork specifically is that I am a cyber stalker and that they feel the need to protect themselves because I've been doing this for 10 years.  Now obviously, if you look at the document that I was given, this couldn't be further from the truth.  As I only started making videos about him, in 2011 so already there is a massive discrepancy in your claim against me which also would not mean that you've met your current husband Kai when he was 15 years of age.  you specifically say 10 years.  I've been doing this which I haven't.  my first video was uploaded in 2011 talking about the weird sporadic behavior of filming an ex-girlfriend when she was having a seizure.  Definitely not normal behavior.  Regardless of that, this is what's going to happen today.  My attorney is going to ask for a continuance because I only roughly had about a week and a half to prepare for this.  and regardless of how petty or ridiculous the claims are against me that he is claiming, you took a social commentator who just covers things publicly and you're wasting my time, the court's time, and pretty much everybody's time by doing this.  All I can really think is that this is your attempt to silence me from criticizing anything that you do online.  And I'm here today to tell you that that is not going to happen.  Hello there, so here we are.  Look, we're in Tacoma, Washington right now.  Oh my goodness.  Pierce County District Court.  This is definitely going to be an experience.  This matter is before the court for hearing upon the request of the petitioner that a protective order be issued.  After review of the file and testimony of the party, the petition or order of protection is denied because checkmark petitioner requested dismissal of petition.  So I just got out court.  Okay.  And What I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised that Greg dismissed his own protection order against me, which was surprising and something I did not expect.  But if you look at the original paperwork, he said that I had been stalking him for 10 plus years and that I was cyber-stalking him specifically.  But he dismissed his own case today in court.  And I have to demonstrate something that was quite interesting.  So let me pan this over a little bit like that.  Like this, okay?  Mind you, this is the first time I've ever been in the same room or even vicinity of Onision.  Ever.  Ever, ever, ever, ever.  He took me to court.  Last week, I think it was January 14th, I was served some paperwork.  that said Onision and Kai Jackson, his husband, are filing an anti-harassment order against me, which was shocking because all I do is I just talk about things that they do publicly online.  But one of the most interesting things is how he walked in the courtroom and allowed me to demonstrate because I think an example... Um, is, is... He had this, like, strance like this.  Kind of like... You know?  He walked in and had his paperwork and went like this.  And he was kind of like... Kind of with a slouch.  And he made some, like, really loud sighs.  And his overall demeanor was just like, I have this in the bag.  Best way I can describe it is very, very pompous.  So what was going to happen today is I was going to request a continuance to rebuttal what he originally filed against me.  But he did, in fact, dismiss his own, um... his own uh... petition against me uh... in specifically it referenced in his his dismissal is that he is going to seek other means uh... that he was advised by an attorney to seek other means uh... rather than a protection order which means at least that how it's interpreted to me is that this isn't done yet uh... he is at.  i'd truly believe he is going to attempt to take into civil court again but under different circumstances specifically in regards to slander uh... I 100% believe that.  And when that time comes, I will let people know.  This is not done yet.  But again, I need to stress this point.  Everything I do and everything I say is public, man.  Do you not get that?  Does it not go through your brain that everything I talk about is public on here?  It's public record.  The things that you do, the things that you say, the things that you've been accused of, you've done publicly, you've released publicly.  Everything is public.  It's public record.  So for you to waste the court's time, to waste law enforcement's time, because you know what?  That sheriff deputy had to go to four different houses.  The deputy didn't even find where I lived.  They found where my parents live.  They gave him a note card and they said, like, have your son call us, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But they couldn't even find where I lived to serve me the paperwork that you wanted to file on me.  Okay?  I'm not... criminal.  I have done nothing to you personally other than talk about you publicly and this is like as personal as you can get so down below in the description.  okay first of all let me show you this.  this is the screenshot.  so I did hire an attorney and that attorney was $2,500 and all I'm asking in this video is if you guys could donate $1.  literally this video is gonna get over 50,000 views.  I know that if you could donate $1 to my GoFundMe page so I can pay off my credit card because I used my credit card and I charged a $2,500 flat fee to hire a criminal attorney when all reality is that he had the whole thing dismissed himself.  So I don't even understand why you would go through the effort of filing a protective order against somebody who's never been around you, who's never been at your house.  You dismiss it yourself.  It doesn't really make a lot of sense.  So this is him and me in the courtroom right now.  Uh, you can see me standing next to my attorney.  You can see him in his tennis shoes.  Uh, it looks like, from what it looks like, he was wearing a bulletproof vest.  Which, if you know anything about him, when he was banned from the convention VidCon, uh, he was going to wear a bulletproof vest.  I don't know, it looks like, it really does look like he's wearing a bulletproof vest.  I wouldn't be surprised, uh, if he was, but, like, dude, I'm not threatening, I'm not threatening you, I'm not doing anything to you, I'm not trying to affect you, per se, in any way.  content for people to respond to, and I'm a public figure and you're a public figure, and trust me, if you wanna go down this legal route, I will go down this legal route with you.  And I don't want to do that because it's a waste of time and money.  But if you hate me that much, if I affect you that much by the things that I say and do on YouTube, because you're a public figure, I'm a public figure, and I cover things publicly that you do.  If you have a problem with that and you want to take me to civil court for slander, by all means, I invite you to do that.  Because I will come back ten times harder than you can expect.  I have videos after videos and documents and emails and your emails interactions with me, man.  You know what's more crazy?  Is that I have email from November of this couple months ago.  You thanked me for not using images of your kiddos in my video.  You thanked me.  You sent me an email thanking me.  And now... And now, like, you try to intimidate me?  Look, you can't intimidate me, dude.  I'm not going to stop talking about you when what you do is public.  And the things that you say are public.  Do I need to show you this?  Like, can I just repeat, this is all you need to know about this man.  He said this.  He said that.  I'm not even going to read it out because it makes me too angry.  I will never comprehend how someone can say that.  If you have a problem with me responding to your vitriolic garbage, the things that you say and affect people in such a negative way, and you're going to sue me for slander because of that?  By all means, go ahead.  I have endless amount of time, not so much money, but one thing that has been established. ",
