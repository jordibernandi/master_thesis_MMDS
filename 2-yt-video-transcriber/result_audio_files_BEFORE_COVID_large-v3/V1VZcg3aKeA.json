            "text": "To people who don't know much about guns, the AR-15 is like the Deebo of the gun world.  It's big, it's black, and the media is constantly telling you how scary it is.  Why you tripping, Deebo?  Sure, fucker, knock your ass out.  Oh, man, that's messed up.  Why don't you give him back his chain?  What chain?  Yeah, what chain?  However, they don't ever show or tell you how scary they are to criminals when they're in the hands of responsible gun owners.  Take this video, for instance, where two guys use an AR-15 to stop a home invasion.  Get the fuck out of here!  Here.  There are tons of these cases where responsible gun owners use AR-15s to protect their lives.  So why are people constantly asking gun owners why they need an AR-15 for self-defense?  I think the problem is that most people have been lulled into a state of dependence on the government protecting them.  So they never see themselves as the shooter defending their lives.  They only see themselves as the people being shot.  And when that's the only lens you see the world through, you on a subconscious level truly believe you're not responsible for your own safety.  So the idea that someone like me would have an AR-15 for self-defense is baffling to you because, well... We have police, and anyone who's not a police that has a gun is a threat to them because they never see themselves as the shooter defending their lives.  They only see themselves as the person being shot.  Can an AR-15 be intimidating?  Yes.  Is it way more effective than a handgun?  Yes.  Is it easier to shoot accurately?  Yes, yes, and yes.  It is all of those things, and that's exactly why I need them because I have the right to have the most effective means to protect the one thing I can't get back if I lose it, my life.  You don't get to play politics with my ability to defend my life.  We have over 300 million guns in this country.  You can't get them all.  I don't care how many common sense gun measures you pass.  The only guns you'll get back will be the guns for people who need them the most because they're not criminals.  They're just people trying to live their life and protect it the best way.  they know how.  No one is forcing you to own an AR.  You have every right not to have the same level of protection as I do, but you don't have a right to take my most effective means of protection because you choose to put your life in the hands of a government body who may or may not be there when you need them the most.  As long as there are people willing to take my life, having the most effective tool to guard against those type of people will always be a necessity.  So to answer the question as to why does anyone need an AR-15, I need an AR-15 because protecting my life is worth more than a gun.  that is simply good enough.  The defense of my life and the people that I love deserve the best.
