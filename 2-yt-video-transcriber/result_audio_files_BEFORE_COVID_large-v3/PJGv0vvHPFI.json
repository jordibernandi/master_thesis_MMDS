I'm the non-attorney spokesman and facilitator for Trusts Unlimited, and I'd like to thank all of you for taking the time to listen to this call, those that are on the call this afternoon, perhaps for the first time, and those that will be tuning in on the replay over the next 24 to 48 hours.  I'm going to move quickly through this call.  It's going to be handled a little differently. ",
