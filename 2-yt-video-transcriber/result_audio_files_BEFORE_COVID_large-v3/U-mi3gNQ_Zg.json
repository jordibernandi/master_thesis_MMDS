The question that we've just learned is whether or not they're prepared to impeach two.  Because to be clear, if House Democrats impeach President Trump for a quid pro quo involving military aid, they have to call President Zelensky a liar.  If they impeach him for abusing his power or pressuring or making threats or demands, they have to call President Zelensky a liar to do it.  If they impeach President Trump for blackmail or extortion or making threats or demand, they have to call President Trump a liar to do it.  I yield back. ",
