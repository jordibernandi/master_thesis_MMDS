            "text": "Hello, everybody.  I'm going to have to upload this a little early because my schedule tomorrow has changed.  So I'm going to get right into it.  After two years of investigation into the Russia collusion, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate admit that there's no collusion by the Trump campaign.  Now let's move on, shall we?  How about we investigate the Obama administration for selling automatic weapons to El Chapo's drug cartel to increase violent gun deaths to push a political agenda to pass stricter gun laws to take guns away from law-abiding citizens.  The Fast and the Furious scandal with Obama and Eric Holder and the Obama Justice Department, it's becoming clear why the Justice Department under Obama, that Obama left behind, wanted Trump gone before he was even sworn into office.  Hmm.  Let's think about this some more.  Declaration of a National Emergency on February the 15th, 2019.  Envelopes at the funeral.  Silence from Obama, Hillary, Bush, and others.  It's time for justice, you think?  Well, drug kingpin Joaquin El Chapo Guzman testified that he gave millions of dollars to Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and Hillary Clinton.  No wonder Schiff and Pelosi are scrambling like hungry rats through a garbage can for food to bring more investigations against Trump and obstruct progress in this country.  It's all connected, the envelopes, the military tribunals.  In times of national emergency, people can be detained indefinitely and tried by tribunals.  think about it people.  now let's move on to Ilhan Omar.  Omar asked without letting him reply Elliott Abrams whether he would support crimes against humanity or genocide if you would believe they were serving U.S.  interests as you did in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.  She posed that very rhetorical question after she had made known that she considered the U.S.  attempts to defend democracy in Venezuela a U.S.-backed coup.  the same position of the repressive Maduro government.  so she's siding with the communists.  the Maduro government whose leader refuses to give up power after the people of Venezuela voted him out in a legitimate election which proves she supports dictators and regimes that support the peoples that suppress the people's voice and oppresses those same people.  that's who she supports.  She went on to say, Ilhan Omar, she went on to say that she wanted to find out if a genocide will take place and if Abrams will look the other way because American interests are being upheld.  So Abrams told Ilhan Omar, I don't believe this line of questioning is meant to be real questions, so I will not reply.  So Omar said, She further pressed him for a yes or no answer, and he said no.  Her idiotic response was, I'll take that as a yes.  Can a person be more stupid than this woman?  Well, here's the thing.  Omar's comportment at the hearing was, as well as her obvious belief that the United States is an imperialist and reactionary nation that by its very nature abuses human rights, should alone be reason enough to have her removed before she can do some real damage to the United States.  She's anti-American and does not serve the interest of the American people.  Share this video, please, with as many people as you can.  We have to get these anti-Americans out of our government before it's too late.  And that's the giggling conservative today.  Y'all have a good one. ",
