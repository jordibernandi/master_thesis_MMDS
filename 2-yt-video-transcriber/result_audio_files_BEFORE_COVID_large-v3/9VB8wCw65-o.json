I mean what else could you call it?  you could just call it lesbian.  okay.  so this guy is serious about this.  okay it doesn't matter if you're married to a woman if you're touching your penis or as he also put it if you're looking at yourself in the mirror and become aroused by your own body then you're gay.

Um, and anyone who hears this is probably going to be laughing because people in our audience realize how ridiculous this is.

That does make me gay.  And now I hate gay people.  Because I'm afraid now that I'm going to be attracted to them.

It's not enough for it to be its own sin.  They're so obsessed with homosexuality for it for them to make you scared even more of it.  They were like, it's not just a sin.  It's gay.

She should have told me the truth.  People are getting lesser sentences for that or they're getting off scot-free for it.  And it's all because of the gay panic, right?

You know what I mean?  It just affects people in a different way, in a different reaction.  You know, I mean, an example I give to people is like, you know, for example, Game of Thrones had so many scenes of people being beheaded, tongues being pulled out, child being burned alive, right?  And people were watching it, and all of a sudden when somebody, I don't know if you haven't watched it, so no spoilers, somebody, a favorite character got raped, there was a petition to cancel the show, to boycott the show, right?  Like, so the rape scene was... one step too far.  even though he had a lot of murder and child burning and a whole bunch of other stuff.  that was okay but the rape was the problem.  the rape was the part that.  so I don't.  I think this is why I think for even among all the sins like I know transgender stuff homosexuality I think I don't know why people just react to these things more like you could tell somebody that oh so and so committed genocide or like oh what a bad man like.  oh this guy is gay.  and all this you know the level of disgust for some reason is more.  i don't know.  jackie's saying aroused by one's own body uh what i think he's portraying his own thoughts here because that's just a weird association.  uh subham is saying yeah i don't know does anybody get aroused by their own body?

I sent you an article with the study showing that homophobic people are likely homosexuals themselves.  I can send the link to Alia as well.  Well, I mean, yeah, I'm probably not going to see it.  I get way too many messages.  But again, if there are studies like this, be careful.  just because it's more likely.  that doesn't mean all.  Okay.  So just if somebody is a homophobe, that doesn't mean they're gay just 100% of the time.  Okay.  It doesn't mean, just in case you didn't hear what I said.  The mad gay theist is saying you can't become gay that way.  The only way to become gay is to apply at headquarters.  Oh, really?  We have to apply at our headquarters.

We have built a global community, and now we are tearing down geographic, cultural and language barriers so we can find each other and support each other.  In the last decade, we have built the largest atheist community in the world.  Now we are doing the same in other languages.  With your help, we have started Atheist Republic in Persian and Arabic.  As we grow, we can dedicate more time, staff and resources to start doing the same in Spanish, Portuguese, Malay, Bengali, Urdu, Hindi and other languages.  We are providing community, support, informative content and amplifying the voices of those who need protection, especially in countries where people feel isolated simply for their lack of belief.  We want to be there for them, and we are only getting started.  Help us get there.  Check in the description for ways you can support our projects. ",
