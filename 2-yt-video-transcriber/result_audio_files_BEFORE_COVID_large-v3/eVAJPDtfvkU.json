            "text": "Women are always single.  It doesn't matter what stage of the relationship you're in right now at this very moment.  She's always single and she always has the ability to walk out on that relationship.  It's just up to her when she decides to do it.  But best believe she always has her lineup and her stable of men that she can run to.  Her beta male provider husband can't do anything about this because he's a beta male.  And in fact, it'll just go straight over his head.  He'll have no idea what the hell's even going on.  She's only loyal to herself and her emotions.  and what satisfies her, what pleases her the most.  How can she gain value from another man's attention?  How can she feel validated today?  Which is a lot of the reason why women wear makeup.  Women wear makeup all the time just to stand out from other women and actually kind of like peacock themselves and appear as though they are the prize and they are the catch, when in fact underneath all that makeup, She's not looking too good.  She's really not.  She's only loyal to herself and her emotions.  Women operate out of emotions.  Everything that they do is emotional.  If you think about it, everything that a woman does is based off emotions.  Men are very logical.  We tend to operate out of what makes sense.  What can we do to fix a situation, to fix an issue, to better our environment around us, better our circumstances, make more money?  What can we do in order to achieve that?  We don't operate out of emotions and how we feel day to day, second by second, minute by minute.  She has literally the ability to pick any man she wants to and determine when she feels like getting into a relationship.  When she feels like getting into a relationship could be whenever.  She could literally feel like getting into a relationship one day, get into a relationship that day, and then give it a week later, and she's already cheating, and she's already looking for the next monkey branch to branch onto.  Give it a week, give it a month, it doesn't matter the time period, she's always looking for another man to monkey branch to.  She's always flirting with other guys at work.  Now, if any of you guys have been in the workplace, you already know these women are out here flirting with guys at work, and they're married.  I see it all the time in my job.  I have women approach me, flirt with me.  Managers, I have managers approach me that are married, show me pictures of their beta male provider husband on their phone.  And another thing, these women's husbands are not even their screensaver.  And... What they have instead of their husbands as their screensaver?  Pictures of dogs, cats, anything else.  Newborn babies.  Because the beta male provider doesn't provide shit for them.  He doesn't provide anything for them.  The only thing he does is he provides a roof over her house.  He doesn't get her sexually aroused at all.  He provides a roof over her house, stability, consistency.  Women hate consistency.  Speaking of this woman at my work, so my manager, who's about probably in her mid-30s, I'm 22 myself.  She's always constantly flirting with me, always giving me dirty looks.  and she's my head manager.  She has my phone number and all that, so the communication between us does extend outside of work sometimes, but honestly, I'm not trying to get fired from my position at my work.  So she has a husband, and she actually showed me this guy.  I don't know why, but she felt like showing me.  I'm pretty sure I know why, and I'll get to that in a minute.  But she shows me a picture of her husband, and they took like Christmas pictures, Thanksgiving pictures, like family pictures.  They don't have any children.  This guy is morbidly obese, And when I say morbidly obese, he's probably north of 350 pounds.  Not even joking.  And this woman, you would think she's a slim, thick white girl with blonde hair.  And she looks pretty good for her age.  She would always open up to me after work about her sexual escapades, and basically she settled for this guy.  She really did.  She spends most of her time at work, so she's away from this guy, and the majority of the time that she's at work, she spends flirting with me.  And I really don't feed into her energy at all because quite frankly, I don't really like to mess with married women at all.  But I can just tell from the way that she acts around me that she has probably stepped out on this guy plenty of times.  If she's doing this at work with me, and I just recently, I've been at this job for about a year now.  She's been there since the very opening, which was in like 2015.  So it's been like five years.  It's guaranteed that she cheated on this guy.  If you show like you're a beta male provider and you show emotions and you're very consistent, that drives her pussy up.  Another thing I want to touch on is why women wear makeup.  And you might be thinking, well, women wear makeup to get pretty and dolled up before they go out and they just want to look nice.  Like, shut the hell up.  All right.  Shut the hell up about that.  You know why they wear makeup?  They wear makeup because they're trying to be hypergamous on your ass.  Now, if you haven't taken the red pill, you probably think, oh, she's just trying to look nice when she goes out.  She wants to look presentable.  All this bullshit, right?  She wants to look really good wherever she goes because that's what all women do.  And they wear makeup and eyelash extensions and they get all dolled up, spend an hour to two hours every morning waking up early just to look this way.  Well, that's all bullshit.  You know why?  Because as soon as you get in a relationship with a girl, it might not be in the first month.  Hell, it might not even be in the first year.  But eventually, she's going to stop giving a shit about how she looks around you.  Who the hell wants to buy into that?  I know I don't want to buy into that.  I don't want to buy into a woman that as soon as I set my needs aside and decide to jump into a relationship with, she all of a sudden stops giving a fuck about me and stops caring.  I remember I was in a relationship about two years ago and as soon as I got into a relationship with this woman, we would go on dates before.  Okay, rewind a little bit.  We would go on dates.  prior to me actually officially making it official.  And this woman, this young lady, she would always be dolled up, dressed to the nines, looking real sexy.  She would look real nice, real hot.  And as soon as we got into a relationship, all that shit died out, guys.  And I mean it died out.  I'm talking about she started wearing her hair up, she actually cut her hair really short, stopped wearing makeup, started wearing baggy clothes when we go out.  She just stopped completely giving a fuck.  But one thing that never ever changed, what never changed was she would always, always, always be dressed to the nines as soon as she would get ready in the morning and go out to work.  Why do you think that is?  She was in a relationship with me, who at the time was a beta male provider.  Why do you think that is?  Why?  Because she was looking for a potential, someone else.  She was looking for someone else.  She was being a hypergamous woman who was seeking out another branch to latch on, to monkey branch to.  Because she thought she could do better than me.  And just like she did that with me, she can do that to you.  She can do that with the guys you know.  She can do that with hell, anyone.  Your brother, your cousin.  These women are out here being hypergamous.  They don't give a fuck about your feelings.  They operate out of emotions.  If you want to have a partner, do yourself a favor and buy a dog. ",
