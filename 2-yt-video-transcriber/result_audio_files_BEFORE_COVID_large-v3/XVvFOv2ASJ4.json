            "text": "yeah?  yeah?  yeah I don't know.  He said, nobody responded to him.  So he got the permit.  He got the permit.  So there's no one that can come with a permit and show or have a copy of it?  That's it.  He got it.  But he said that's it.  You guys don't have it at all?  No.  They got it.  I'm saying he got the permit.  He's the one that put it together.  He has it.  Right.  But the problem was, everybody said he wasn't going to show it.  So you say that's it.  Nobody came?  Okay, I'm going to tell you.  What would the permit be for?  You can have a party as long as you're not blocking the street.  Right, so what would the permit be for?  Why is he talking about the permit so much?  A party.  You can have a party.  So you need a permit to gather?  Yeah.  In America, you need a permit to gather.  Is that what you're saying?  That's what I'm saying.  So we don't have a right to gather?  You have a right to gather, but this amount... So why do you talk... I mean, there's a right to gather, but there's a limited amount to gather.  Is that what you're saying?  So according to the United States Constitution... So I'm not going to get into... Yeah, because what you're saying doesn't make sense.  If we have a right to gather... We have the right, constitutional right to gather.  So what's the purpose of that permit?  To allow you to have the party to a certain time.  That's unconstitutional.  Okay, that's not up for you to decide.  It is, it has been decided.  Okay, who's decided that?  What case law?  The United States Constitution, right to assemble.  What case law?  Right to assemble.  Assemble for what?  The right to assemble.  There is no for what.  There's just a right to assemble.  There's a right to assemble.  Period.  Why is there not an assembly?  Because people aren't making money off it.  Who's making money?  They just told me they're making $20 for DJs.  Who told you that?  Okay, but we still got the right to assemble.  That's something they've been doing for a long time.  You have the right to assemble.  That's in the Constitution.  That's your right to assemble.  That's why they keep saying people in the street.  We have no control about people in the street, but they can't break up the party.  They can't break up the assembly.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm a civil rights fighter.  That's what I do.  I make sure they don't come over here and violate our rights.  We have that right, brother.  If we don't stand up and address it, they're going to keep shutting us down.  And we're going to always be second-class citizens.  But we pay them.  And we Americans too, we have that right.  That's right.  That's why when I talk about a permit, they keep talking about a party.  But damn a party, this is an assembly.  We have that right to assemble.  That's why nobody's going to jail.  That's why they can't really enforce.  They tell you what they want you to do.  And they know we're going to comply.  I'm a big Nick, bro.  That's what's up, man.  That's what's up.  So, yeah, don't never just say let them go.  Don't never say let them do their job.  That's not their job, bro.  That's not their job.  This is what I do.  He'll tell you, this is what I do.  That's why I talk to them.  That's why they address me and they try to get out of subject.  Now I don't have IG, but I'm on YouTube.  He'll get to you on YouTube, yeah.  It's all about community, that's all.  We got rights, man.  That's why they ain't really doing nothing for us.  Like, that permit means nothing.  It means nothing.  You don't need a permit to assemble in America.  You don't need a permit.  And then they can't get you for the North because the Supreme Court don't rule that this is free speech.  The music is no different from a church bell.  Church bells rang, don't they?  Right?  So this is no different.  It hasn't been ruled upon.  The Florida Supreme Court says this is free speech.  They know this.  Orders don't trump the Constitution.  It's just a rule.  That's all the ordinance is, bro.  Yeah, so whenever they come, whenever they come, whenever you DJ, and I saw you on the mic, whenever you DJ in the gym, you ask them, don't we have a right to assemble?  You can't control people in the streets.  You can't control people in the streets, bro.  You know what I'm saying?  And they want to say they charging.  They ain't charging nobody to listen to music.  But these are lies they tell people.  To make money.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  You're absolutely right, and that's something else we need to address.  But what I'm addressing right now is that they're talking about permits.  But in America, you don't need a permit to assemble.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah, I'm not saying I'm with them.  I'm not saying I'm with them.  I'm just documenting them.  Right, document them and then address them properly.  That's what I'm doing.  Because that's where I'm going.  In America, in America, the Constitution is right.  And you're absolutely right about that.  And you're absolutely right about that.  Everybody needs to be accountable.  He started the process.  The process for what?  To assemble?  The process isn't an assembly, it's a party.  Who's labeling it a party?  Where's your reasonable or terrible suspicion that you just determined it was a party?  Who labored in a party?  I would refuse to answer that question too.  I wouldn't answer that question either.  But who labored in a party?  Did you?  Who labored in a party?  He did.  He labored in a party.  So no music is playing right now.  This is an assembly, right?  So now it's an assembly.  Right, but you guys are blocking the street.  We're law enforcement.  We're enforcing an issue, sir.  No, but you just said you're law enforcement.  Where's the law you're enforcing?  You guys were assembled on the street, yes?  Was traffic being impeded?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You're the investigator.  You're the investigator, so you investigate that.  I don't know.  That's why we were here.  We were here because the street was being impeded.  Okay.  So why are you still here?  Because you're still talking to us, yes?  Are you still asking us questions?  I'm not asking why you're still here.  Are you asking us questions?  Yeah, but... So we stopped asking questions.  You can go.  Okay, come on.  Okay.  Put the camera down.  Put it down.  Put it down.  Put it down.  Okay, get back.  Get behind somebody.  Right now.  Thank you, sir.  We just need them to go.  Let them go.  But you know what?  But if they also see people standing up to them, some of the tyrant tactics are going away.  Right now who's blocking track?  So in America, we got a right to assemble.  They're leaving.  They're leaving because we have a right to assemble.  And we know this.  But then my dad get high, y'all keep taking people's money.  One shout out to your fellow Sikhs, man.  Shout out to the Sikhs.  I'm in Miami.  He's a member of the Sikhs.  He recognized me.  So make sure you show love to him.  So now they are leaving.  The Constitution prevails.  Big Nick, South Florida Accountability.  Out.  Ah! ",
