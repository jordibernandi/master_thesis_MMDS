            "text": "Breaking news from the Middle East.  Four ships have been damaged off the coast of the UAE.  No one's claimed responsibility, but fingers are pointing towards Iran.  Tensions are getting really high there and it seems the world is on the brink of World War III at any moment.  Now, I want Christians to understand that as a prophecy teacher, we are not really looking for war.  We're looking for Jesus Christ to come back and to end all wars.  But he cannot do that just off the cuff.  He cannot just force people.  The way human nature works is this.  If you live long enough, you see it.  Whether it's people or nations, as long as one side thinks that it can win, it will keep fighting.  It will not stop.  So God loves all the sides.  He loves America, Iran, Saudi Arabia.  He loves everybody.  But people are choosing to fight each other.  Rather than giving their hearts to Jesus and following His will, then it would end all the conflict.  So this is what we're living with right now is the possibility of World War III being set off.  And I would like to give you a timeline as well of what I think.  But First, let's catch up on the background, what's been happening.  This is from Reuters, and it reports, Washington withdrew last year from the 2015 peace pact between Iran and global powers aimed at reining in Tehran's nuclear plants.  Since then, Washington, which means Donald Trump, has ratcheted up sanctions on Tehran, saying it wanted to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.  That would devastate their economy.  So he's taking the strong approach against a tyrant, against an oppressive regime.  And usually actually that works because evil never stops.  They just keep doing evil.  When you appease evil like you appease Adolf Hitler, you just get another World War II.  US President Donald Trump wants to force Tehran to agree on broader arms control accord and has sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Gulf in a show of force.  Trump on Monday said Iran would suffer greatly if it targeted U.S.  interests.  Tehran has called the U.S.  military presence a target rather than a threat and has said that it will not allow its oil exports to be halted.  A fifth of global oil consumption passes through the Strait of Hormuz from Middle East crude producers to major markets in Asia, Europe, North America and beyond.  The narrow waterway separates Iran from the Arabian Peninsula.  So oil prices are rising in response to this.  They've got a G20 summit coming up around June 28 and 29.  So global powers will meet.  I don't believe that there will be a war before then.  But this is the problem, as I said to you.  Most of us, especially we as Christians, want peace.  But there are just some people who are, the Bible calls, bitter foes.  They just don't want peace.  And David prayed this.  He says, Woe is me that I dwell in Meshach, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar.  My soul has dwelt too long with one who hates peace.  There are such people who hate peace.  I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.  So there is a long conflict that's been brewing in the Middle East between the Sunnis and the Shias.  This has been happening long before Western powers got involved, long before America was even discovered.  So no matter how much peace you speak, how much negotiations, go on, they are for war.  This is really, to me, reminding me of Revelation chapter 6.  There's a very specific reference to the oil and wine in the third seal.  So Revelation 6 describes the seven seals of Revelation, the first seven events that kick off, really major end time events.  And you can hear in the third seal, Behold, black horse and its rider had a pair of scales in his hand and I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying a quart of wheat for a denarius a denarius is one day's wage and three quarts of barley for a denarius.  and do not harm the oil and wine.  very interesting do not harm the oil and wine.  if we go back to this article you will see that even though four ships were attacked no oil was spilled but the attack did significant damage to the vessel's structures.  How interesting is that?  So there will be an attack on oil but the Bible says in the end times do not worry about it because God has commanded.  do not harm the oil and the wine.  In Bible interpretation you can always take a spiritual and a literal meaning.  and The spiritual meaning, first of all, the oil represents the anointing, the Holy Spirit, the wine represents the blood of Jesus Christ.  That's the positive spiritual meaning.  And so God could just be saying, do not harm the anointing, the anointed ones, and do not harm the blood of Jesus Christ.  But on the other hand, you could just take this literally.  You could say that God is speaking to the economy that the oil is not going to be affected and the wine is not going to be affected.  Well, the oil seems to be not olive oil, but crude oil.  This is what we're dependent on.  The whole world is dependent on crude oil.  The wine, you can just guess whether that's food or whether it's referring to something else.  Beverage in general.  Let's go to CBS News.  Here's its report.  Saudi Arabia said Monday two of its oil tankers were sabotaged off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in attacks that caused significant damage to vessels.  One of the ships was en route to pick up Saudi oil to take to the United States, a Saudi government minister said.  The announcement by the kingdom's energy minister, Khalid al-Fali, came on the heels of a new warning to sailors in the region from the U.S.  While no blame was cast at Iran or other nations for the alleged attack on the ships, it fueled fears that a miscommunication or small act of antagonism in a politically charged region could quickly escalate into full conflict.  Again, I think that this is really easily a setup for a major war in the Middle East.  there is coming a major war between the Sunnis and the Shias.  I think 2020 is the timeline, but again, most prophecy we've seen, most prophetic signs we see, gives itself a leeway of one or two years.  So for instance, the blood moons of 1949 to 1950 was actually one year after the major fulfillment in 1948 of the state of Israel being reborn.  So you just have to watch that.  People want to peg a prophetic sign and say, well, I've got the timeline and Jesus has to do this or that by this time.  And I think we're pretty close, but God gives himself a leeway of a year or two.  Let's take a look at where these nations are.  We're talking about the UAE.  This is where those ships, four of them were were attacked or sabotaged.  This is Saudi Arabia, the main Sunni nation, the main Sunni Islamic nation in the world.  You got Yemen here that is Shia, Iran is the major Shia nation, and you've got Syria off the map, okay?  Out to beyond Iraq right there.  So there's tension from every direction and Saudi Arabia is really fighting the Shias and the Shias are fighting the Sunnis.  So this is what is happening right now, and if you didn't realize, this is exactly what used to happen in the Bible times.  God's enemies, the people who are fighting against the Jews and Israel, are ending up attacking each other.  It seems really illogical, but yet this is what we find in the Bible.  For instance... When Jonathan defeated the Philistines, we find this verse, 1 Samuel 14, verse 20, Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to battle.  They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with swords.  The English standard says, behold, every Philistine's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.  We have all of these Islamic nations that are pretty much anti-Israel, and yet, rather than fighting Israel at the moment, they're all fighting each other.  And the Bible says that they will be fighting each other until they can come to some sort of one party dominating over the others, creating what I call a United States of Islam.  And then there will be an all-out war against Israel predicted in Ezekiel 38.  Another scripture that talks about this, there are many instances of this, 2 Chronicles 20 verse 23.  You see the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, so they're all in present-day Jordan, utterly to slay and destroy them.  When they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy another.  So this is the kind of miracle that the Bible talks about.  When your enemies come against you, you can believe for the enemies to slay the enemies.  The enemies can be set into mutual confusion and they end up biting each other and slaying each other.  Now this news about Saudi Arabia's ship problems doesn't end.  This very same time, we see something that I think can fulfill more prophetic scriptures.  Saudi Arabia is sending out ships to pick up weapons from Europe but they're having a problem getting them.  so the headline here says French activists successfully block Saudi ship from loading weapons.  a human rights organization called it a victory for mobilize civil society when a Saudi cargo ship left France on Friday without a planned batch of weapons.  France, along with other Western countries, including the US and the UK, has been supplying arms to Saudi Arabia, which is leading the coalition bombing Yemen.  In so doing, say human right campaigners, they risk complicity in committing grave violations of the laws of war.  Leaked classified French military documents published last month showed that French weapons are being widely used in the Coalition's bombing campaign, including in civilian zones.  The conflict has already killed thousands of civilians.  The conclusion is actually they did not, this human rights group called Christians for the Abolition of Torture, they didn't win their legal case, but the ship nonetheless did not dock to pick up the shipment, but instead moved on to Spain.  What we find is they went on to Spain and they had the same problem.  Saudi ship facing arms protests leaves Spanish port.  So vessel believed to be carrying EU manufactured weapons departs Santander amid deep concern from arms control groups.  So they're saying that European manufactured weapons are killing the civilians in Yemen.  So this really reminds me of Revelation chapter 18, the fall of Babylon the Great, because we find here a superpower with great shipping interests having problems with their shipping.  And isn't this the week for Saudi Arabia's ships to have problems on every side?  So it may be just a partial fulfillment.  We often see a prelude to the full fulfillment of prophecy, but at least the picture is becoming clearer and clearer if you're watching for prophecy.  The Bible is so amazingly accurate and predictive.  So, the identity of Babylon has been much disputed.  I'm just going to take only one theory.  There are many theories about this, but the one that I think makes the simplest case is that Babylon is Saudi Arabia.  It's a very rich country, very powerful.  The whole world deals with it, gets money from it.  It influences politics, and in the end, it will fall.  Now, take a look at this.  The Bible says in verse... 11 of chapter 18 in Revelation.  And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her for no one buys their merchandise anymore.  merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, marble, cinnamon, incense, fragrant oil, frankincense, and there it is again, wine and oil, wine and oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and bodies and souls of  men.\".  This is what really, the most wicked trade that is going on, is the slavery of men and the sex trafficking.  And this happens on shipping containers.  So a lot of illegal activities happen there.  But one day, the day is coming, when they will cease, they will mourn, because they can't even pick up their cargo.  They can't even sell.  So this is very interesting what we're seeing right now.  I said I would give you a bit of a timeline.  I made a prediction that the year of war should be the year 2020.  This is in my book, The Divine Code, a prophetic encyclopedia of numbers.  So I'm just checking it out on Amazon.  This is now the third week.  It's still number one new release in Christian prophecy.  Volume 2.  Let's go to Volume 1 because Volume 2 is... contains numbers 26 to 1000, but the one that we want to talk about right now is volume 1.  It contains codes and numbers from number 1 to 25.  So that's not 25 chapters, it's 50 chapters on all sorts of numbers in between as well.  Let me give you a little excerpt from the book.  This is on the number 20 and why I believe that 2020 really signifies war.  I wrote in my book, Chapter 20, 20 is the number of physical manhood and is associated with war.  There are 20 potential opening moves in a chess game, though most of them are not taken because they would quickly lead to the opponent's advantage and your defeat.  20 is the age of military service in ancient Israel.  20 is the minimum age of military service in many modern countries, including Japan and Ukraine.  20 is the number of Philistines killed by Jonathan and his armor bearer.  in one of the most daring military moves in the Bible.  And let's just read that to close.  It's an amazing faith scripture.  1 Samuel 14, verse 6.  Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised.  It may be that the Lord will work for us, for nothing restrains the Lord from saving by many or by few.  That's really amazing.  Great faith statement.  It doesn't matter how many we have saved, on our team, doesn't matter how much money we have in the bank account, the Lord can save and deliver.  Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet and his armor-bearer after him, and they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him.  And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about 20 men, there it is, the number of war, within, as it were, half a furrow's length in an acre of land.  And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among the people.  In the garrison, even the raiders trembled and the earth quaked and it became a very great panic.  Boy, Jonathan had faith.  He said, nothing restrains the Lord from saving by many or by few.  Faith does not look at numbers.  So I talk about that and I explain a little bit about how faith works in chapter 20.  So once again, I just encourage you to go and study these codes.  Because 20 refers to war, I believe that 2020 is the most likely year for an all-out war.  Again, give or take a year.  Give some grace.  God gives us grace.  Give Him some leeway as well.  He's moving things according to plan.  And He's not creating war.  Man is creating war.  War could end any time.  If everybody just accepted Jesus, we would all have peace.  We would all resolve every problem.  Personal and national problems.  Jesus would love to do that.  But it takes a humble heart for us to listen to Him and to yield to His plan.  Sometimes it's fighting for our own way.  satisfies the flesh, but it is not from the Spirit.  So make sure that you're on God's side in these tense times.  Possibly war will break out within a year or even earlier.  And pray for Trump because, man, who would like to have this job that he has?  Very, very difficult with all of the weapons testing in North Korea, his borders in the South not being secure, you know, terrorists trying to come through the southern border.  And now you've got Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are at each other's throats for a long time.  So pray for peace.  Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  Pray for wisdom for our leaders.  Pray for our Australian election.  And it's very, very important for freedom of religion and freedom of speech that we get good people to lead this country.  All right, until next time, God bless and keep looking up. ",
