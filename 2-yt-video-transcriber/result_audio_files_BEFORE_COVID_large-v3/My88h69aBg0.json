            "text": "Hey guys.  It's your old pal Cenable here.  Anyways, have you ever wondered how to become pope?  Not exactly an everyday question.  Money if you're pope.  I know I said I was an antitheist, but if I can make money, and I'm pope, and I'm an ancap, then give me that papal throne!  The first step to being pope is being male and being Catholic.  Wow, that's simple.  Like, maybe too simple.  Well, you're right, Banga.  That is a little too simple, which is why that's not actually all you need to do.  Technically, yes, you can just be male and Catholic and become Pope, though that's never happened in history before.  becoming pope is really a process of climbing the catholic hierarchy and after you have fit into the two categories of male and catholic you have to become a catholic priest right.  so to become a catholic priest you must have a degree in catholic philosophy and have a master in divinity.  Next.  So, next you need to become a bishop.  And bishops are the people who make priests priests.  They ordain them as priests.  So, to become pope, then you have to become a bishop.  And to become bishop, you must wait for one of the bishops of your area to die or retire.  And once they have died or retired, then the Apostolic Annuncio of your country, who you don't necessarily have to become an Apostolic Annuncio to be Pope, but what he does is he interviews candidates to fill in that bishop's place.  And if he likes you, and the Congress of Bishops approves you, and the Pope doesn't veto the Apostolic Annuncio's opinion, then you become a bishop.  Hello, Apostolic Annuncio.  I'm here for my interview because I hope to become a bishop.  What is your favorite color?  Uh, red, I guess.  Wrong answer!  Okay, okay, okay.  Next, become a cardinal.  So, turn into a bird?  Benga, go to the principal's office!  Okay.  Unlike the name implies, and unlike Benga said, the cardinals are not literal cardinal birds, which I think is pretty obvious.  Cardinals are just bishops, but they have extra responsibilities, have an extra title, and have a snazzy red outfit.  But they are most known for being the people that elect other cardinals to be popes.  Now, it is worth noting that it is possible to become pope if you're not a cardinal, though The last time that happened was 600 years ago, with the reign of Pope Urban VI, who reigned from 1318 to 1389.  It was a long time ago, and it's very unlikely that you'll actually accomplish it, so it's best to just become Cardinal.  Now, the only way to become Cardinal is for the Pope himself to anoint you as one.  And now, let's get down to business.  Now, four times a day, six days a week, with one day being reserved for prayer, all the cardinals go to the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, and they vote on who they think should be pope.  And when one cardinal gets two-thirds of the vote, that cardinal becomes pope.  And then there's one last step once you become pope.  You get to pick your own name.  So if you were born Donovan, you are not Pope Donovan.  You can make yourself Pope Martin or Pope Johann or Pope John or Whatever you want, there literally are zero rules.  And now that you're a pope, I hope you enjoy your reign.  And who knows, maybe you'll be like Pope Urban VI. ",
