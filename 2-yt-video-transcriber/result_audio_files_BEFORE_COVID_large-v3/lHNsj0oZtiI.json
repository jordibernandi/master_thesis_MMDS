            "text": "Guys, you're looking at my Alexa Pure water filter, rated number one in the world.  In mine, I have two of the plugs.  It comes with four holes in the bottom, and they each have a rubber plug.  I have two of those out, and I've mounted two of these water filters in mine.  Each filter gives you 5,000 gallons of extremely well-filtered water.  So those two give me 10,000 gallons.  Now, you can get this system with the two filters on it.  in it are that come with it over 197 on our website.  it's an unbelievable deal because it the system started out at 249. with one filter.  the filters are about a hundred dollars a piece but you figure five thousand gallons each at a dollar a gallon.  for a bottle of water or spring water That's five grand.  So in a $200 system, now with both filters, you've got $10,000 worth of water or 10,000 gallons.  Think of it.  Now what we're looking at here is this is before we installed the invention that we patented.  We sell, we build it here in Mississippi.  Send it out to you guys.  You bought thousands.  But this is without it.  This is two filters.  Now the filters installed in the top tank have nothing to do with what you're watching here.  This is outflow rate from the bottom tank.  In other words, the water's already filtered through the two filters.  Now the two filters did double the filter rate or the filter time.  That it takes to come out of the top tank into the bottom tank.  But what happens is it starts losing air.  This is in the design.  They something that may have not been anticipated.  But guys if you've ever if you're familiar with plumbing at all and any house or building you have one pipe that goes up through the roof.  and it's just.  it pulls air in as you flush your toilet or drain your drains or whatever and if you don't have that your shower won't even drain guys much less anything other than that.  and the reason is you have this displacement.  when that water drained from the top tank it filled the bottom tank with water, not much air.  And it can't pull any air through the charcoal filters, right?  So what we did inventing the AquaFlow Max is to solve that problem.  Now what you're looking at in the original video that was taken down by YouTube a couple of days ago, they took about 3000 down I think, but the original video would let it play through.  But what I'm doing is showing again the outflow rate.  And what we've done, I marked it at a half gallon.  And for this demo, you can see right there, it's marked.  Now, it took 10 minutes to get to a little less than a quart.  And that's when I ended the video.  Now, if you've got one of the Alexa Pure systems, do it and time it for yourself.  Put your picture down there.  If you don't have an AquaFlow Max intake or airflow system, you... You understand exactly what I'm talking about.  So 10 minutes, we will mark it again.  I cut all that out of this video.  And so the half gallon is what it takes for my coffee pot.  So that would take about 20 minutes to get that half gallon right.  Here's the Aqua Flow Max.  This is what I noticed was the problem.  It's all custom built.  The bottom fitting that has the washer, guys, is made to fit your Alexa Pure water filter system.  It also fits any system like a Berkey or whatever.  that has a half-inch hole in the bottom.  Just check your hole.  This comes in, the system's sealed.  The top comes off.  It's easily cleaned with a straw brush.  And it's made of... It looks like glass, but it's extremely durable plexiglass.  It won't break.  You won't get any broken glass anywhere in your system.  Also, when you fill up the top tank, it will not... let water into your bottom tank that's not filtered.  Now look at the difference in the outflow rate by simply by pulling one of the rubber stoppers out, guys, in your system, inserting this air intake called the AquaFlow Max here.  It took 10 minutes.  Now this is not sped up at all.  You can look at it.  21 seconds, we are at... what it took 10 minutes to get.  I'm gonna get my half gallon in about 49 seconds.  it would have took 20 minutes.  and guys again you got these.  you know exactly what I'm talking about.  or if you're gonna get one The Add This 1995 attachment.  It's custom made to fit.  There's no modifications made to your system that will hurt your warranty.  The Alexa Pures are stainless steel.  They don't rust.  And I use it for all my water.  My ice, tea, cooking.  My cold water, coffee, everything, guys, it takes out the chloride, the fluorine taste.  99.99% of everything is filtered out of this water.  It's a tremendous system.  But again, at $19.95, you got plus your shipping and handling.  20 times your outflow rate.  That's because we're pulling air in from the top tank.  But you can go to our website at bpreathwatch.com and check this thing out, guys.  $19.95, you can't beat it.  It's unbreakable.  The tip that you see there on the end, on the right, fits into all the slots in the bottom of your Alexa Pure filter.  It was designed that way so that there was no modifications to your stainless steel tank.  Think about it, you slide this in, you put your washer and your nut on there, hand tighten it, you're good to go.  Comes apart at the top so you can clean it with a straw cleaner.  Very easy, very easy to install.  And if you remember, if you look in the tanks, if you guys just getting them, for all you folks that have had them for a couple years, you got the rubber stoppers.  Just pull one out, insert this, and you'll notice a big difference.  Guys, again, we invented it to complement the number one water filter system in the world, and it helps support our channel.  We appreciate it.  It's a heads up.  Be safe. ",
