And I went and I looked at eclipses for the last several millennia.  And I noticed that in 2014 and 2015, there were going to be these four blood moons falling on Passover and Sukkot two years in a row.  And I thought, wow, when is the last time that happened?  And I saw it happen in 1967 when Israel captured Jerusalem.  In 1949 when they became a nation.  The time before that was 1492 when all the Jews were kicked out of Spain.  I noticed there were some around when Messiah died.  And I thought, okay, these are signs.  And so I did some more research and I thought, oh my goodness, these are like A railroad train flashing lights.  A train is coming.  They're warnings.  I never said anything would happen on the day of the eclipse.  Now, a lot of people took my stuff and said all kinds of crazy things.  But I stick and I still believe totally that these are warnings.  Look at the days we've been in for the last several years.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, it is incredible. ",

It fell on the exact day a year before as well.  The year before wasn't on our calendar, but on the biblical calendar, it fell on the 24th day of the month of Shavuot.  What is so significant?  If you remember, it's always in the mouth of two or three witnesses.  So here we have these two blood moons, one at the beginning of Trump's second year, the other one exactly at the end of Trump's second year, same day that he was inaugurated two years later.  What is significant about this blood moon?  Get a load of this.  This is going to knock your socks off.  Fasten your seat belts.  Hold on.  Okay.  In Revelation 6, it talks about the four horsemen.  And the red one is the war.  It takes peace from the earth.  Zechariah 6 is where John got this from.  Zechariah 6 talks about the four horsemen.  Zechariah 1 speaks specifically about the red horse that you hear about riding in the mulberry trees.  Remember that?  In Zechariah 1, it talks about the red horse and the mulberry trees.  It happens on the 24th day of Shavuot.  All right.  Now, Trump, that blood moon was on the 15th day of Shabbat.  Nine months or nine days.  I mean, nine days before was this blood moon.  And it was exactly at the end of his second year.  Now.  Are you ready?  I want you to get this.  The Zechariah 1 vision, where Zechariah sees the red horse riding in the mulberry trees, and the month of Shavuot is all about trees.  Okay, this is why it's significant.  Well, guess what?  Zechariah 1, the vision took place at the end of the 70 years of captivity in the second year of Darius.  Here we are at the end of the 70th year of Israel becoming a nation in the second year of President Trump.  Just like the second year of Darius.  And if you go to Haggai 1, you see Haggai 1 also takes place in the second year of Darius.  And that is when they're saying we need to rebuild the temple.  And they were saying, wow, it's not time to rebuild the temple.  And so I really believe that this next year, and the red horse speaks of war.  So here I also see from biblical perspective, there's a good chance we will see a major war, civil war, different kinds of wars.  That's the focus this next year.  But we also might hear an announcement to let the temple be built. ",
