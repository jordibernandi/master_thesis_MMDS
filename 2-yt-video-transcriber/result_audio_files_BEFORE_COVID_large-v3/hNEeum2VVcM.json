Franklin Graham has requested a day of prayer today, June 2nd, for President Trump.  President Trump, who is having Spiritual attacks, ever since he has announced that he was running for president, has not stopped, has not ceased.  It has been going on every day since he ever even announced that he was running for president.  President Trump has been out there where he didn't have to run for president.  He had a wonderful life in front of him.  He could have retired.  He had plenty of funds and a beautiful, wonderful family to enjoy his remaining years in peace.  But he has been fighting for us, for us, for we, the people, because he knows that the world is under spiritual attack.  And right now, we are definitely in that time where things are coming to a head.  Franklin Graham calling out for global prayer on June 2nd today is being heard by church leaders around the world, spiritual leaders around the world.  And while Seavine News, Seavine Network is not a church, it is not a spiritual entity, but it is filled with patriots who are very much, very much in love with the world and are in love with the Lord and are in love with our nation.  And they want to bring back the Lord into our midst, into our families, into our homes, into our everyday lives.  United States was built as a nation One Nation Under God.  And we want to bring that back.  So Seabine News, we have, even though we're new, we have found through Google Analytics, we have over 500,000 people visiting our website every day.  And it's growing.  And so we want to also contribute to this day of prayer ",

Now, today in Seabine, we have one of our volunteers.  Her name is Lillian Day.  And she has been wonderful in helping us.  She also has her own business.  She has been a volunteer.  And in the past, she has prayed whenever we have had a meeting ahead of time.  And each and every time she has prayed, it's almost brought everyone to tears.  This beautiful woman is so blessed with the Holy Spirit, this intercessor to the Lord.  And so she has... gone ahead and she has done a video that I'm going to play here.  that is going to be for all of us.  If you are not in a place where you can fully become part of this, please go ahead and save this video for a time that you can be in silence and you can pray with us.  For it says in the Bible in Matthew 18, 20, For where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am in the midst of them, says the Lord.  So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen to be able to go and listen to Lillian's prayer. ",

            "text": "Hi, my name is Lillian Day from Scripture IRL, and today we are going to pray for our nation.  June 2nd, 2019, we are called to pray, and this is a call for the body of Christ to come together to unify and to be in agreement about the direction of what our country is going in, and that God is the authority here, and that those in leadership will listen and obey the word of God.  So let's pray.  Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for blessing us with the ability to be a part of the United States of America, for allowing us to have freedom where so many don't, God.  And we come before you now asking for your blessing and protection on our nation, asking, Lord, that you would bless and protect our leadership, including our president, Lord, that you would guide him, direct him, and allow him to hear and see your word.  And allow him to know your voice, Lord God.  I pray, Lord God, that he would make decisions that are honoring and glorifying to you, Lord.  That this nation would get back on track and be a Christian nation, Lord.  That we wouldn't see abortion.  That human trafficking would end.  in the name of Jesus, Lord God.  You are able to do what we can't.  And this world has become... filled with evil.  It is a foundation of evil, Lord.  We have been tricked, deceived, lied to, manipulated, Lord, and I rebuke that all in the name of Jesus.  This is spiritual warfare, God, and we're coming before you asking for freedom, Lord, knowing that you have been working this out, Lord, knowing that Jesus died for our freedom, and yet still we sit here in bondage, bondage because we don't fully understand the warfare that is all around us, the spiritual warfare that is going on, designed to kill, steal, and destroy from us, Lord God, but you came to give us life, Lord, to set us free, God, and we want that full freedom.  We don't want the illusion of freedom.  We want complete freedom in the name of Jesus.  So we're coming before you asking, God, that you would lead this nation back to a nation that is fully sold out for you, God, that you would surrender our hearts, God, and that we would seek truth, Lord.  that we would ignore our emotions that we would ignore the feelings god and start looking for facts.  god that our eyes would be open for your truth.  god all truth lord.  we know the enemy is attacking us all as a nation and of course our president of course the leadership.  of course there is evil influence that is trying to destroy what you want.  unified we are the united states of america and we have never been so divided than we are right now, Lord God.  So I'm asking God that as the body of Christ, we can come together and be unified according to your word and pray for this president, pray for his administration, pray for protection, pray for wisdom, discernment, guidance, Lord.  I pray, God, that you would open up all of our eyes to see your truth, God, and that we would see the warfare around us, Lord, that we would see that there is an attack, God, and that we need to fight back.  We can no longer just sit back and be complacent.  because the enemy is attacking us and he is crafty and he is evil and he's trying to ruin us, this nation and this world, Lord God.  I pray God that you would open up our eyes to your truth in all things.  I pray God that we could focus on you, Lord, and pray for your will to be done in this nation, Lord.  i pray god that the evil powers that are trying to disrupt your plan god that you would rebuke them on the name of jesus that they would have no influence over your plan lord god that they would fall away god and that their plans would be revealed in the name of jesus lord and that their evil disruptive plans lord god that there would be consequences.  god because you are god of justice you are god of love lord god and of mercy for those of us who love you god but you have wrath lord god that will rebuke all of the powers of evil that have come up against us.  lord This is a hard time to be living in, God, when there is so much division, God.  But with you, there is unification, Lord.  Today, we are called to unify and pray, God.  And I pray that this would be the beginning of the renewal of the body of Christ being unified again, Lord.  That we would no longer be divided, but we will come under your biblical command and be one and follow your order and follow your will, God.  Our president, God, is who you put in place, God.  And we pray, God, that your will be done through him.  That your will be done through our administration.  That your will would be done no matter what the feelings, no matter what the plans of the evil one has, Lord God.  That you would reign here, Lord God.  Your authority would be everything, God.  And the authority of the enemy would be diminished.  It would be completely eliminated, Lord God.  This war has gone on for far too long.  And we have been ignorant to the plans of the enemy, God.  So I pray for our eyes to be open, God.  You are good.  Your plans are good.  You will win.  You will have victory.  And the enemy will lose.  And I know he's going to keep trying, God.  So we rebuke him all in the name of Jesus and ask for you to reign in our hearts, in our minds, and in our lives, Lord God.  That we would slow our speech, God, and choose love.  Love that is patient, kind, not envious, boastful, proud, or rude, God.  And that when we represent you, Christ, that we would represent you with the love of the Lord.  and that people would be drawn to you, God, because of the way that we are representing you, God.  I pray that you would forgive us for misrepresenting.  your goodness, Lord.  I pray, God, in the name of Jesus, that you would help us to see, God, that you are good and that we are failing, God, and we need you.  We can't keep doing it on our own.  We desperately need you.  Help us, guide us, direct us, lead us, Lord God, in all things.  We love you.  Thank you for letting us be a part of the United States of America.  Please bless and protect our country, our nation, the leadership, our families, Lord God.  God, we know that you care about all life and that you've given us all life and that there is life that we are fighting for, unity that we are fighting for, purpose that we are fighting for.  Allow us to be unified in the fight because anything divided against itself will fail.  But God, we are united in you, God.  Help us to stay united in you, Lord.  We love you.  We need you.  Guide us, direct us.  Show us the way, God.  We love you and thank you so much.  In the name of Jesus, amen.  Folks, thanks so much for praying with us.  This is an important opportunity for us to be unified as the body of Christ.  Whether you're pro or against Trump, it doesn't matter.  We need to do things according to the Bible.  And I would encourage you, whatever you do, to obey the word of God.  And if you are a believer and you're struggling with praying for the president or praying for this administration, I would encourage you to just go search out what is being done that you can pray for.  Like look up the human trafficking and what has happened since Trump has been in office.  look for things that you can be in agreement on.  don't constantly look for ways to cause division because guess what that's the enemy.  the enemy is trying to divide the body of christ.  we have an opportunity to set all of our feelings all of our emotions aside and focus on the lord focus on what he wants us to do and it is our job to pray for our nation to pray for our leadership to pray for our families and to pray for the body of christ to be strong and to be unified.  We need to be united.  We need to set the example of what it means to be united because division is only from the enemy and we are seriously divided right now.  So thank you for unifying in this prayer.  I pray in the name of Jesus that we can continue to stay unified, continue to seek the truth.  Even when there is disagreement, we can come together and speak and discuss in the love of Jesus and find a way to be united.  There is a need here.  We're blessed to be a part of the United States of America.  We're blessed to have freedom that so many do not have.  Let's not take it for granted anymore.  Let's fight for truth.  Let's fight for God's plan.  Let's see victory here because there will be.  When God's in control, there is victory.  We have to stop trying to take control from God and give it to Him and let Him be the authority of our lives and of this nation.  Thank you so much.  We look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you for praying.  God is good, and he wins every time.  There will be victory in Jesus.  Thank you so much.  Hi, my name is Lillian Day from Scripture. ",
