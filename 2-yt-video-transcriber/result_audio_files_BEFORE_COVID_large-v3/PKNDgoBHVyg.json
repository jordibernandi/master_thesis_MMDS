Black Friday has come and look what we got A truckload of plastic that will never rot.  This cucumber's wrapped in plastic These crew socks and this salad.  This pup doesn't go for plastic And neither should you.  We don't have much time.  We're counting on you To break free from plastic And no single use.  We wish you were more ambitious.  We know that you make commitments But we want some more specifics Of how you'll improve.  So stop using so much plastic Using so much plastic and no single use. ",
