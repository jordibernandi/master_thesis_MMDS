            "text": "Thank you.  Wow.  So they get free gas for their personal vehicles as well?  And you get to shoot people with no repercussions on a paid holiday?  Man, here comes somebody running.  Somebody's late for work.  They started the head count without you.  That's unfortunate.  That's unfortunate.  Be careful.  That's unfortunate.  Step away, sir.  You've got a gun, sir.  Step away.  Step away.  You've got a gun.  Why don't you step away, okay?  Why don't you learn the Constitution?  Why don't you call your supervisor?  Call your supervisor.  Call your supervisor.  Great.  Great.  It's a public lobby, sir.  Bueno.  Daddy told you to get behind the desk.  Oh, no, no.  I already called name control.  All right.  Thanks, bud.  This was the same guy from before.  This is the guy that doesn't know shit.  Yeah.  You should call 9-1-1.  But he doesn't know the Constitution.  You should call 9-1-1.  Great.  Are they all coming?  Are you going to launch Air One as well?  No, that's the helo.  Wow, really?  Is this your first day on the job or your last day?  Actually, it'd be my two years.  Two years?  So you've been a bad cop for a year and six months?  No comment.  I assume you would comment.  Yeah, I would probably plead the fifth on that one as well.  But that's just me because I'm going to hedge my bets that way.  You calling in a drone strike?  Oh my god.  Code 3.  Everybody respond.  Code 3.  Cameras.  Cameras.  Cameras.  Cameras.  Alpha 2, man down, man down.  I told you.  Manny, bring me everyone.  What do you mean?  everyone?  Everyone!  No, yeah, we're good.  We're just reporters.  We're doing content for a story.  Yeah, that's fine.  We're in the lobby, and we've been here before.  No, no, we're allowed to be in the lobby.  Yeah, but this is not the public.  It's a public lobby.  You guys don't need a permit.  No, we don't.  We do have a permit.  It's not the Constitution.  You can be on the street all you want and film all you want.  But I thought this was a public lobby.  It's a public lobby.  This is a public lobby?  This is a public lobby.  We have business.  We're here to film.  Like I said, you don't have anything to do with the attorney room, and you don't have.  Did you need help with something?  Don't touch my camera, sir.  Did you need help with anything?  I don't need help with anything.  Don't touch my camera, please.  What's the purpose of your business?  I'm here to film.  Film what?  I'm filming, I'm shooting content for a story, for a news story, for a publication.  A news story.  Regarding?  A news story.  Regarding what?  News story.  I understand it's news, but what type of news?  I'm not going to divulge any further.  A news story, that's all you need to know.  Did you swear an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States?  That's a yes or a no question, sir.  It's a yes or a no question, sir.  I want you to be nice until it's time.  To not be nice.  Yeah, well, you're all up in my grill, dude.  You're all up in my grill and you're telling me to be a nice guy?  Why are you guys being so mean?  I'm not being so mean.  Why don't you get back to work?  You're here to state, you're here for official business.  Yeah, I'm here doing my constitution protected first amendment.  Why are you being so aggressive, dude?  I'm not being so aggressive.  How many... Am I wearing... There's like five guys with guns here and you're telling me I'm being aggressive?  You're deputy sheriff, sir.  I'm unimpressed.  So, I mean, like... I didn't ask you to be impressed, but you're being aggressive in your manner.  I can see your eyes.  You look upset.  Uh-oh.  Why are you upset?  Oh, my God.  Do you need medical attention?  Do you need medical attention?  Do you need medical attention?  Are you having a mini stroke right now?  Do you?  Are you having a mini stroke right now?  Are you going to help me?  Yeah.  Are you going to help?  Sure.  Okay, so.  In the military.  And then we got Steroid Boy on the phone over there.  Is it the policy of the L.A.  Sheriff's Department?  Hey, where's Lee Baca right now?  Is he in prison?  I don't know.  Where's Tanaka?  I don't know.  Is he in prison?  I don't know.  You tell me.  You're making it perfectly abundant.  You tell me.  So the number one and two in the Sheriff's Department are in prison or on their way to prison.  Right.  You tell me.  Tell me.  You guys know how to have all the answers, right?  Relax, dude.  I'm relaxed.  Relax.  Calm down.  Yeah, you got a gun.  You're stacked off.  He came to me.  What are you talking about?  Well, it's your job to get out of his way.  You're threatening him.  You're the one who's done it.  No, you're threatening.  I'm threatening.  How am I threatening?  Why are you so aggressive?  Why are you such a stupid?  Is that against the law, sir?  That means you're a soft person here.  Why are you being disrespectful?  Is that against the law?  You're out of ideas right now?  You're out of ideas right now?  Are you out of ideas?  So is being aggressive or rude, if that's what you call it, is that against the law?  I already told you my purpose.  At any point, you can get back to work, so... I told you.  That's the only reason that we need to be here.  Okay.  It seems like you want to be here to annoy.  No, that's your job.  You're the guys that have, there's five guys with guns.  We work here, though.  You don't work here.  This is a public lobby.  I understand that.  So that means it's my lobby.  But you have no business here.  Yes, I do.  I'm filming story.  Great.  Is that illegal?  Is that illegal?  What penal code is that?  No, it's not illegal.  Okay, then kick rocks and get back to work.  Don't you have something else better to do with your life?  Oh, wow.  Really?  Why don't you?  How about you with your welfare check?  I'm here with my... Oh, so what does that mean?  You guys are on the county.  You guys are paid by us.  We work, though.  We're working.  Great.  I'm very proud of you.  What's your money source?  I'm very proud of you, sir.  You're here to annoy.  That's all you're here for.  You have nothing else better to do, right?  Is that against the law?  I didn't say it was.  No, you're right.  What penal code?  It's not against the law.  You're right.  Okay.  Well, then get back to work.  You need to go to work.  I'm at work right now, sir.  So you make money off of this?  There's a source of income from what you're doing?  Honestly not.  You didn't answer that.  I'm an activist.  I'm an activist.  What are you an activist for?  Boy, you're not very smart, are you?  I don't know how many... So now you're going to disrespect me.  Again, is that illegal?  So you're being disrespectful.  And you told me to get a job, so it goes both ways, douchebag.  Get out of here.  Get out of here and get back to work.  You're not here for anything.  You have no official business.  Boy, you are... And what penal code is that?  I told you there isn't one.  Okay, well then get back to work.  You keep asking the same questions.  You keep asking the same questions.  We have no business here.  Boy, you are the stupidest man alive.  Thank you.  Is that Lindsey?  What's your badge number?  4496, sir.  Great, thanks.  So what else?  What other questions do you have?  We actually just wanted to... You have no business here.  You're good at annoying people.  Well, it looks like I did a pretty good job so far.  You have no business here.  Okay.  That's your opinion.  You told me I was on the accounting.  You are.  Well, what is your job?  Who do you think pays your salary?  You do.  Okay.  I have a job, so you don't.  Oh, yeah.  So, you're such a douchebag.  Hey, go home and kick your dog, okay?  I mean, we literally could have been done in... You're not here to annoy people for no purpose.  Hey, let me ask you, are you a good cop or a bad cop?  Lindsay, are you a good cop or bad cop?  Seriously.  I know.  Have you ever given sworn testimony against another officer in a court of law?  Okay, that would probably make you a bad cop then.  Skinner, can I get your badge number, please?  Skinner, can I get your badge number, please?  Cat's got your tongue?  And you guys wonder why there's a disconnect between police and society?  Robles, can you tell me your badge number?  714, sir.  Great, and was it that difficult?  And I appreciate your being professional with me and telling me that.  Great, what penal code am I breaking?  How many unarmed civilians have you shot and killed in the line of duty?  Did you get a paid vacation?  How many open IA complaints do you have against you currently?  Yeah, you're doing the math on that one, I know.  I know nothing.  No, I'm just trying to get your name.  It's like 27 syllables.  We all have different ways of approaching.  We all have different ways of... But that's the problem.  If you guys are trained to deal with people, you're trained to de-escalate.  These three, these two mainly... Now, Lindsey was a total douche.  She's just a tough guy.  I want to be.  Well, yeah.  No, you know, my partners have been here for a while.  They have a lot of these plans, you know.  Based on... You told me to get a job, okay, and you're going to tell me to make fun of people?  You want to poor-shame people?  Get the fuck out of here.  You want to annoy people and you want to disrespect people.  That's why you're here.  Great.  And is that against the law?  Is it against the law, Lindsay?  No.  Great.  You've had all the fun you can take?  You already made a different name calling.  So dinner and a movie are out?  Is that what you're saying?  So you're going to stay out here and escalate?  No.  Yeah, you are.  Then shut up.  Don't say anything.  Fit the limit.  Use it.  Thank you.  Glad you know that.  Glad you know one part of the fucking Constitution.  No, I'm good with Robles.  Yeah, Robles is cool.  He's decent.  No, you told us to get out of here.  You don't understand the Constitution.  You're the one that started all of this.  Yeah.  Yeah, you lost your shit and thought we were doing something wrong.  We don't need to take it, you know, the insults, you know.  Oh, oh.  Okay, yeah, but Lindsay tells me to get a job, and I'm on welfare, and I have, you know, so it goes both ways, sir.  I'd like a complaint form against these two officers right here, please.  Yeah, there we go.  I'd like a complaint form, sir.  Welcome to MCJ.  There we go.  Wow, no, is that your welcome?  No.  Is this the welcome?  Why don't you shoot us too while you're at it, okay?  If you really want to give us a welcome.  If anybody comes in the lobby in their disturbance, let me know, okay?  What's your name?  My name is Lieutenant Vince Grant.  Great, thank you.  I'm the watch commander for MCJ.  Thank you for de-escalating.  Can I ask you a question?  Can I have your name?  I don't need to give you my name.  What's your question?  This is a public lobby.  Are we allowed to film inside a public lobby?  Yes, go ahead.  Take your time.  Great.  Thank you.  Enjoy yourself.  Thank you.  Did everybody get an education today?  Yes, sir.  Okay, great.  Okay, great.  You can talk to Lindsay, too.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I agree 100% with that statement.  Okay, come on, guys.  Alright, back to work everybody.  All right, well, there you have it, kids.  So that escalated quickly, and compliments of the L.A.  Sheriff's Department.  Lee Baca and Under Sheriff Tanaka are either in prison or on their way to prison, and fish stinks from the head down.  Hey, where's Lee Baca?  We're looking for Lee Baca.  Is he incarcerated yet, or is he on his way?  No comment?  That was your boss.  That was everybody's boss here.  He's headed to prison.  The watch commander, or lieutenant, whatever his name was, was very professional and understood that photography was allowed. ",
