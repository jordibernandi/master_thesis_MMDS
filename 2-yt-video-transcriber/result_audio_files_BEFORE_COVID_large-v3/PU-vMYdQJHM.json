            "text": "As one of America's most formidable women of letters, Toni Morrison always gets a lot of attention when a novel of hers is published.  Her latest, Beloved, came out in September and is already in its third printing.  It's fast moving to the top of the bestseller list, following the pattern of Morrison's four other novels published over the last 16 years, The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, and Tar Baby.  When Tar Baby was published in 1981, Morrison's stature in the world of fiction earned her a Newsweek cover story.  Beloved is the second Morrison novel to become a Book of the Month Club main selection.  Beloved is the story of a runaway slave, Sethe, who tries to kill her children rather than see them return to slavery.  She succeeds in killing only one, a daughter named Beloved.  The story unfolds around the return of Beloved's angry ghost.  She moves into the house with her mother and sister, Denver.  Here, Morrison reads from a passage that illuminates Denver's view of the murder and Sethe's need to make Beloved's ghost understand it. ",

And seeing her mother diminished shamed and infuriated her.  Yet she knew Sethe's greatest fear was the same one Denver had in the beginning.  That Beloved might leave.  That before Sethe could make her understand what it meant, what it took to drag the teeth of that saw under the little chin, to feel the baby blood pump like oil in her hands to hold her face her head would stay on to squeeze her so she could absorb still the death spasms that shot through that adored body plump and sweet with life.  Beloved might leave, leave before Sethe could make her realize that worse than that, far worse, was what Baby Suggs died of, what Ellen knew, what Stamp saw, and what made Paul D. tremble, that anybody white could take your whole self for anything that came to mind.  Not just work, kill, or maim you, but dirty you.  Dirty you so bad you couldn't like yourself anymore.  Dirty you so bad You forgot who you were and couldn't think it up.  And though she and the others lived through and got over it, she could never let it happen to her own.  The best thing she was was her children.  Whites might dirty her all right, but not her best thing.  Her beautiful, magical best thing.  The part of her that was clean. ",

They frequently couldn't even name them.  So that they were denied humanity in a number of ways, but they were denied that role, which is early.  I mean, it has nothing to do with history.  It's what women do.
