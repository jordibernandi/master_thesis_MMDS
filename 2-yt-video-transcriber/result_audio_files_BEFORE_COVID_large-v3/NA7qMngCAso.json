Because there's nothing controversial about holistic health itself, right?  But... But your father, your grandfather left such a legacy.  First of all, what does it mean for you all to hear so much about him now?  In the post-Nipsey Hussle's death, we hear a lot about him.  People who didn't know about him before know about him now.  What does that mean? ",

And that's something that's very interesting because he's at a different era of what we're used to seeing.  And so you would think, as a community advocate, Nipsey Hussle, that he would have different projects at his age, but he ran across Dr.  Sebi.  and what did that mean for us?  what did that mean for his era?  it meant a lot because it wasn't a new thought it was just not an uncovered thought.  so we we celebrate that just like when we celebrated when lisa lopez was involved.  we celebrated when um quite a few out there have found out who dr savey was.  so this here is a back to center when it comes to knowing who he is, and I appreciate it.  I actually, I never got to meet him, but I love his thoughts.  So we celebrate that right now because it's a very important subject.  Yeah. ",

Then, three hours later, You know, they found the shooter, found the killer, then all the speculations went out the window.  It's just that our society always, when negative things happen or tragedies happen, we quick to jump to an opinion instead of always knowing facts.  So the fact that Nipsey Hussle Didn't die over doing a documentary and it's like it make you think well Why would they want to kill Nipsey over doing the documentary if he wasn't dr.  Sebi or he wasn't killing people?  Yes, he was talking about the message but theory on killing nipsey hussle?  no there's no conspiracy theory.  nipsey hussle died you know in gang violence something that was very tragic to our society and to our into hip-hop period.  yeah yeah it's.

He was a man who knew that he was sick.  and he needed to be healed first.  So in healing himself first, what did it do for us?  It taught us through natural healing that it can be done with the courage that we all possess inside.  So we must look at that and say, this was a man just like us walking down the street, sick and tired of being sick, going to the doctors like everybody else, feeling defeated.  Impotency makes a man feel defeated.  So he walked around defeated.  So with that being said, he had to make a change, and he did because I sit before you.  And so does his grandson.  So what does that mean to us?  We can be fearless.  So who is this man?  He is a man who wanted to be well and balanced, and he shared it with us.  And that takes such courage and love. ",

But we've been prone, and this has been generational, your great-grandmother gave it to your mom, your mom gave it to you.  And then the doctor will tell you it's hereditary.  Well, if my mom had given me bacon, my grandmother ate bacon, we all get diabetes, we all get high blood pressure, we all get high cholesterol from genetically modified foods, which destroys the body.
