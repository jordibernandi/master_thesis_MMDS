            "text": "Oh, she's mad.  She's not a happy girl.  This didn't go very well, and even the Washington Post are reporting on how not well it went for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at Trump's State of the Union address, because the God Emperor absolutely smashed it with a 76% approval rating by a CBS News poll.  At times she remained seated as others stood, at times serious while others applauded.  Yeah, I noticed that a bunch of you didn't applaud, you know, black people and Hispanic people having the lowest unemployment rating ever and things like this.  You guys only applauded yourselves for existing in Congress, which really was easy to see for everyone watching just how unbelievably self-centered you people seem to be.  But just the ones of you in the white, Good thing you left your hoods at home this time.  So her reaction to Trump's speech was somber and prompted a debate on social media about her sullen appearance and the apparent condescension in telling a woman to smile.  That's not what they're saying.  They're saying she looks like she took a defeat there, which is great.  Apparently a Wall Street journalist writer called Peggy Noonan wrote that she had a rare bad night, not looking spirited, warm, and original as usual, but sullen, teenaged, and at a loss.  Good observation, she did look that way.  But she of course clapped back against her critics.  Why should I be spirited and warm for this embarrassment of a State of the Union, she responded.  Tonight was an unsettling night for our country.  The president failed to offer any plan, any vision at all for our future.  We're flying without a pilot and I'm not here to comfort anyone about that fact.  What?  What are you talking about?  Like, he is demonstrating that his plan is working.  That's what he did repeatedly over and over to the point where you guys all start applauding.  He is, in his opinion, making America great again.  And if the reaction to that speech was anything to go by, then over three quarters of people who watched it also agree with him.  You are very definitely in the minority in your opinion of that speech, Ms.  Cortez.  Just to let you know, Trump is going to carry on acting in America's interests.  And you're like, we're flying without a pilot.  No.  Or is this because Trump did a full-on Bolsonaro and put himself firmly against socialism and firmly on the side of capitalism?  Firmly on the side of growing like the Wall Street, there was, I think it was the Washington Post again, did a fact check and Trump had said 5.3 million jobs and they were like, no, wrong, it's only been 4.9 million according to our calculations.  Well, I mean, I wish we could all fail that.  well, I suppose, right?  Like that's such a great success.  Twice as many jobs as expected.  I've watched a load of clips and like read a load of articles from the regular alphabet soup networks.  And even the ones that hate him the most, like MSNBC, they can't say, well, this isn't impressive.  And yet you're sat there going, we're flying without a pilot.  I'm not here to comfort anyone about the fact.  Is your problem that he's not a dictator?  Alexandria?  Is your problem that he isn't Maduro?  Because that seems to be what you're saying with flying without a pilot.  Freedom doesn't need a pilot.  What it needs is a president who's going to act in the interests of his own nation.  And that's what he's doing.  And it's working out.  It seems to be making everything a bit better for everyone in the country.  Especially the minorities that you claim to care so much about, even though you wouldn't applaud.  Like minimum, like lowest number of people who are disabled out of work.  Don't you think it's good that disabled people can work and earn their living and get sort of self-respect in that way?  You know, I mean, I know disabled people, they don't want to be sat around at home, unable to do anything.  They don't want that.  You know, but you didn't clap for that.  You didn't applaud because Trump apparently has no plan.  And Trump having no plan is going great.  And oh, they are so offended.  Noonan's tweet was perceived as the equivalent of telling a woman to smile.  And that's a problem.  Don't tell a woman smile because I don't know, harassment, patriarchy, there's gotta be some fucking reason.  We're not going to smile and clap like seals to make him or you comfortable.  I know you did though, didn't you?  You fucking did.  But he was like, ladies, well done for being in Congress.  Most women ever.  on the 100th anniversary of women being able to vote.  Congratulations.  And you all did clap like seals then, didn't you?  Ladies, don't look serious while a man tries to tell you what you can do with your bodies.  He's not.  He's saying what you can't do with a baby's body when the baby is actually ready to be born.  You absolute psychopaths.  The very fact that you're discussing abortion up to the point of birth and afterwards, that this is even a conversation, is absolutely vile.  And nobody's, nobody is going to let you forget this come the next election in 2020.  You are the party of murdering babies that are about to be born.  That's what you are, just so you know.  And the fact that you're standing by it under the guise, the rubric of, well, it's a woman's right to choose.  No, no, no, no, no.  There is a complication here, and that is the baby's right to life.  And the baby itself is something that would survive out of the womb at this point.  All you have to do is give birth to it.  Sorry, no, way too far, way too far.  And it makes you look like monsters, like butchers.  absolutely vile and you should be ashamed of yourselves.  But anyway, she says, smile like an idiot no matter what.  And the world is your oyster.  Yeah, I agree.  You should probably smile like idiots.  That won't make you look really weird.  A lawyer and activist wrote, notice how women are constantly asked to smile.  No, I fucking don't.  I walk around streets all day.  Like I'll go into town, I'll go and get my stuff.  I'll walk past women and men who are walking past one another and literally fucking.  no one says to the other person they should smile.  No, I just never see it.  But this is apparently to put others at ease, to appease, to smooth out our jagged edges, to blunt our rage, and crucially, always make sure that everyone else is comfortable.  and what does it get us?  Well, apparently it gets you the record number of women in Congress, you ungrateful bitch.  But it didn't matter because everyone else was cheering and Nancy Pelosi was encouraging them up to cheer.  So Cortez cheered anyway and high-fived people and things like this.  So you can act enraged afterwards, but we all saw you in the moment, Miss Cortez. ",

And honestly, never have I ever experienced journalists being so active in fact checking every single fucking word that comes out of his mouth.  to the point where the Washington Post posted, you know, oh, Trump said the pile of burgers was a mile high.  Incorrect!  Like, what?  Jesus!  This is levels of journalism I didn't think possible before.  But what this all means is, Ms.  Cortez is mad.  Really mad.  That night didn't go her way at all.
