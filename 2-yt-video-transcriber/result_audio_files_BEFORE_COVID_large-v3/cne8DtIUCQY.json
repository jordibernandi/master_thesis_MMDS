            "text": "10-26.  Pretty pulling in the Columbia glass tent.  Hello, gentlemen.  My name is Deputy English.  Hey, man, the reason I'm pulling you over is your derogatory sticker on the back of your truck.  What is that?  How is it not derogatory?  It's words.  It's words, okay.  What does those words mean?  It's ass it eats.  I eat ass, okay.  So some 10-year-old little kid sitting in the passenger seat of his mama's vehicle looks over and reads that I eat ass and asks his mom what it means.  How is she going to explain that?  Okay, let me see your driver's license.  and your registration.  Sir, you got an ID on you also?  7-7.  You got anything illegal inside the vehicle, sir?  Any drugs, guns, or knives?  Large amounts of U.S.  currency, dead bodies, or hand grenades?  Alright, hang tight for me.  Mr.  Webb, step out of your vehicle, please.  Do you have any weapons on you?  No, sir.  Step out.  Can I check you for weapons?  Yep.  I don't know.  Is there a problem with the trunk?  What's that?  Is there a problem with anything?  Is there a problem?  Yeah.  I'll explain it to you.  Step back here.  I'm in front of my profile.  Here's your driver's license back.  Here's your buddy's ID back, all right?  Here's your proof of your insurance and your registration, okay?  Listen to me.  What you have on the back of your window, okay, is a misdemeanor in the state of Florida, okay?  I have four kids.  A 14-year-old, a 10-year-old, a 6-year-old, and a 4-month-old.  If my 6-year-old was to look at me and be like, Dad, what does IE ask me, okay?  I'd be furious, all right?  And the way that we handle this situation, okay, I'm not pleased with.  So what I did is I issued you a court date, all right?  So you can go explain it to the Columbia County Court System.  Okay.  All right.  Just sign right here.  All right.  This isn't saying that you're guilty.  It's just saying the fact that I gave you a copy of your notice to appear.  Okay.  You're going to have a court date.  It's going to be on May 23rd at 8 o'clock.  May 23rd, 8 a.m.  May 23rd, we've got a Monday.  All right, sir.  And now this is my copy.  This is your copy.  I'm going to have you take off one of those letters.  You're not doing that.  You're not refreshing my First Amendment right.  You're not doing that.  I'm going to need a copy of your ID, too.  It's all on that ticket right there.  So, all right, hang tight right there for me, then.  Yep.  Hey, so I pull this Mr.  Dylan Webb over because he has a statement on the back of his truck that says, I eat ass.  Okay.  It's a misdemeanor in the state of Florida.  All right.  I issued him a notice to appear.  I asked them to take one of the letters off so that it is no longer derogatory and he is refusing.  Is that not resisting?  All right.  What are you charging him with?  I'm charging him with obscene riding on a vehicle.  Okay.  It says, it says, except as provided in paragraph one, Charlie, a person who knowingly has in his or her possession, custody or control any obscene book, magazine, periodical, pamphlet, newspaper, comic book, story paper, written or printed story or article, writing paper, card picture, drawing, photograph, motion picture, film, film, any sticker, decal, emblem, or other device attached to a motor vehicle containing obscene descriptions, photograph, or depictions, any figure, image, photograph, record, wire, tape, recording, any written character, goes on, goes on, goes on, goes on, or any... or perpetrating to be for an obscene use or purpose without the intent to sell, lend, give away, distribute, transmit, show, transmute, or advertise the same commits a misdemeanor of the second degree.  Okay.  And he's refusing to remove it from... His back glass.  His back glass.  Is it a citable offense, like a traffic citation?  No, it's a... It's a misdemeanor.  Like there's, it's in the, the, um, quick reference guide, but it's not a citation.  Like when you go to issue a citation for it, I won't let you issue a citation.  So I did, um, eight, four, seven, eight, four, seven dot zero one, one sub zero one, one subsection two.  Has he ever been arrested before?  I don't believe so.  Not in Columbia County.  How old is he?  Twenty... Twenty-five?  Twenty-three?  So I'm taking him to jail and totally shit.  Okay.  I'm good with the statute.  It says I eat ass.  It literally says all in capital letters, I eat ass.  Okay.  Is it like covering the entire windshield?  Is it small?  It's about... Five to six-inch letters, bold, capitalized, and white letters on the back window.  It's as big as this third brake light.  All right.  Make sure you take pictures of all of that.  Yeah, I already got the pictures.  Arresting, taking to jail, totally shit.  That way you can get it off the road, you know what I'm saying?  Okay.  And then what do I do for the notice to appear?  Do I just change it to a warrant affidavit and then request?  You still have it there, citation to arrest report.  Use the same number.  Yeah, well, I haven't transmitted it yet, so... What I'm saying, change it to an arrest report, and then you can do from the arrest report back to the office report.  Okay.  And just narrate in there that, you know, you give him the option to receive a court date for the infraction with the understanding that he would remove one of the letters so it was not obscene any further and continue on his way.  He's refused, so charge him with resisting.  Okay.  Charge him with, you know, that statute, and then tow his shit.  Okay.  Will do.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  All right, Mr.  Webb, let me see your hands.  Place your hands behind your back.  For what?  Place your hands behind your back.  For what?  Because you're going to jail, son.  For what?  For what?  Because I gave you the option to take that off your window, okay?  That is a violation of a Florida State statute, and it is a misdemeanor, okay?  What misdemeanor?  And then I asked you to take it off, and you refused.  So step back here.  You haven't got my phone, huh?  No, you're going to step back here.  Have a seat.  Is there anything illegal inside the vehicle?  You're not searching it.  Okay, I am searching it because I'm towing it.  Get inside the vehicle.  Yes, ma'am.  Okay, your son's going to jail.  So he has these obscene words on the back of his truck that says IES.  I wrote him a notice to appear so that he could go explain it to a judge.  I gave him the opportunity to remove one of the letters so that it was no longer obscene.  He refused.  And whenever I asked him to do it, he was resisting.  And so he's getting charged with obscene riding on a vehicle and resisting.  Can I talk to him?  Me?  Talk to him.  Yes, ma'am. ",
