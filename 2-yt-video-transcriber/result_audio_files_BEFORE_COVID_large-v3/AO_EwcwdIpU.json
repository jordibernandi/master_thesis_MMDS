            "text": "Yeah, we lost the leader.  Yeah, we lost the agent for change.  But instead of us sitting around having a pity party about it, which we're going to have our pity party.  But after we have that pity party, we're going to pick ourselves up, we're going to dust ourselves off, and we're going to turn into clones of that brother.  We're going to use this as a catalyst all across the country to re-energize ourselves and think that we can just imitate what this brother did.  You don't have to ask, what can I do?  He gave you the blueprint.  So what I'm here to do is to make sure that y'all understand this is not just a California thing.  This is not just a West Coast thing.  This is not just a East Coast thing.  Matter of fact, this is not even an American thing.  It's a melanin thing.  It's a colored people of the world thing.  It is a global interaction of energies that have been tampered with pain.  And as you all know, the universal law of karma says that for every action, there's an equally strong reaction.  And by virtue of the fact that I'm standing on the West Coast with no fear, because these are my brothers and sisters, even though they want to keep us divided, we're never going to be divided.  Because who was it?  I think it was someone asked the head of the FBI back in the 60s, what was his worst nightmare?  He said black unity.  So guess what?  You just gave us a reason to unify.  And so the reason that I'm here besides paying my sentiments to my brother, because let me tell y'all something real quick.  People like to say that hip-hop did this to him.  No, this was done to hip-hop.  Wow.  Hip-hop is the victim this time, because here was a blueprint and an example to change and build a bridge between the old-school cats like myself that's on the way out, the past baton to an effective brute that could take up the race.  And we just lost one of our best runners.  So I'm going to need all y'all to study that blueprint, step up, because that's what we're about to do.  We've got to build a bridge.  Grandmaster Jay, you can reach me at the official Grandmaster Jay on IG.  That's all I do.  Please follow me.  Keep up with what we're doing.  Great things are coming now that we have a catalyst.  And we have a reason to be united.  I say As-salamu alaykum.  I say praise God if that's your faith.  But at the end of the day, we're all children of the Creator.  Peace and love to you.  Thank you.
