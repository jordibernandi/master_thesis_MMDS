            "text": "Thank you, Councilman Hurst.  Out of everything you listed, the most important thing that I did was raise my daughter, this little girl over here.  And the only reason I was able to have that ambition and that drive to do that is because I was raised by my single father.  He took it upon himself to raise me and my sister.  And he wasn't even my biological father.  And when him and my mother got divorced, he stepped up to the plate and he says, you may not be mine biologically, but you're my son no matter what.  And throughout my life, there has never been a single time he ever referred to me as his stepson.  I was always his boy or his son.  And I've done the same for my daughter.  So I'm honored and humbled by the award.  But the reality is I'm just a simple boy that came from upstate New York.  I ended up here by chance.  So thank you, everybody.  I appreciate this.  My name is Bob Sharland.  Six months ago, I was diagnosed with neurodegenerative brain disease.  Doctors say my brain's out of somebody who's 90s.  I'm gonna die, but I really don't care.  I'm living each day to the fullest to make the biggest impact on the youth of tomorrow.  My childhood?  My mother raised me for a while, and she married my stepfather, Norman. ",

Being the guy that was there watching the door, carding people, throwing people out.  I've had beer bottles hit over my head.  I was jumped a couple of times.

My hands started shaking, my speech started going off, a lot of memory loss.  I couldn't even eat my food without my hands shaking, or I'd spill food.  Got more difficult at work with my hands.  That became an embarrassment.  I wouldn't even, I didn't even go out public anymore.  I just, I went to work and came home.  Four different neurologists.  I sent them everything.  I said, please just review all this stuff.  Tell me something.  And then finally, a neurologist out in Boston.  He says, you know what?  You've got 11 concussions on the left side of your brain.  We believe you have a disease called CTE.  It's what football players and boxers get from multiple concussions.  In 2011, they said my brain was that of somebody in his late 60s.
