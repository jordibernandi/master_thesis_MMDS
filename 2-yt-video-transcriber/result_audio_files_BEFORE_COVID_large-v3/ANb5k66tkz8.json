            "text": "The Friendly Atheist put out a video.  that's 20 arguments against God's existence, reasons you shouldn't believe in God.  And this is part of a series I'm doing with Capturing Christianity.  and What Do You Meme?  Answering those arguments one at a time.  Here's the argument I'm answering in this video.  If God didn't exist, the world would look exactly the same way it does now.  This seems like a pretty powerful argument to some.  I mean, to say, you know, get you to imagine the world the way it is now.  And you just imagine it without God existing.  And you're imagining it the same as it is now.  And then you're shocked to find out that it's the same as it is now.  Except it's only that way because you're imagining it that way.  Would it really be the same if God didn't exist?  This, I think, is again the worst... one of the worst possible fallacies you can have.  It's circular reasoning.  Allow me to explain.  Because the Ahriman assumes, right, if God didn't exist, the world would look the same as it does now.  It assumes that.  That's the statement of truth.  It just would.  It would look the same.  And therefore, God doesn't exist.  Except... It's begging the question, right?  That this hasn't been proven.  That the world would look the same as it is now.  In fact, there's several things that I think would be quite different.  Ah, but how do I prove that?  I mean, really, this argument is just an exercise in, you know, thinking about your assumptions.  If atheism is true, well, then... Yeah, everything will look the same.  But if atheism is false and God did create all things, then literally nothing would exist if God didn't exist.  So you have to assume atheism to get to this argument, which is an argument for atheism.  Or you can assume Christianity to reject this argument.  And so we're getting nowhere fast.  So the only thing I can think to do that might be profitable... is to imagine the world if Christianity didn't exist.  Because that I can do, right?  I can just imagine the world if Christianity didn't exist.  Well, let me give you some examples of how the world would be different if I did imagine it this way.  For one thing, my life would not have been changed.  My life is absolutely changed by Jesus Christ.  Now some think I'm just making things up to share my testimony.  No, my life was really changed by Christ in powerful and radical ways, permanently and completely.  And that would not have happened without Christianity, right?  That simply wouldn't have happened.  Jesus wouldn't have raised from the dead.  Certainly that wouldn't happen.  I can say then Christianity just doesn't exist.  Okay, this is the theory.  Christianity doesn't exist.  Well, now hospitals and universities that were started in the name of Christianity also wouldn't exist.  which is most of the ones you're familiar with.  My marriage certainly wouldn't exist.  The Bible itself wouldn't exist, which means that Western civilization as it is wouldn't exist.  And a lot of the advancements in modern science likely wouldn't exist.  I mean, this would really change things quite a bit.  Those who've stopped atrocities because of their religious faith in Christ wouldn't have stopped those atrocities.  Now you can assume that all this stuff is wrong, but if you actually take away Christianity, it leaves a big gaping hole in the world today.  Christianity is part of the reason why people are so literate nowadays.  We've always been people of the book and of the text.  So if you take away the Bible and you take away Christianity, then where's this motive for teaching literacy?  I mean, it was churches that were teaching literacy to people at the beginning, starting schools and things like this.  This would not have been the same.  The impact of Christianity over time has been pretty positive and pretty good.  Now we're often familiar with some of the atrocities and some of the worst case scenarios we've heard.  But when you back up and you take a global look at it, it's been a very positive impact and a very positive thing.  But all this is just a thought exercise.  And it's kind of irrelevant.  Because in order to make this statement, you have to assume atheism is true to get to atheism.  If you don't assume it, if you find powerful reasons to believe that God is required for morality and God is required for the resurrection of Jesus and God is required for... the existence of the universe and the fine-tuning of the universe and the intelligent design inside biological creatures, this becomes a pointless argument.  Simply an exercise in one hand clapping, in patting yourself on the back.  And so, so far in these 20 arguments for God's existence, I haven't seen one that I find compelling.  And not just because I'm a Christian, but because I'm looking at the arguments and I'm going, this is not compelling.  I think there's something we can learn from this.  I think frequently those who disbelieve in God do so because there's a lot of mockery, misrepresentation, and shallow thinking about God and about Christianity in particular.  I'm asking that you think a little deeper about these things and that you take them very seriously because these 20 arguments against God aren't.  The next video in this series is... It's going to be interesting.  It's about how if an atheist says to God, God kill me and God doesn't kill him, then that's proof that God doesn't exist.  That's going to be the next one of the series.  Make sure to check them all out.  Playlist over here somewhere, somewhere and down in the description as well.  Thanks again to Cam and John from Capturing Christianity.  And what do you mean for partnering with me for this video series?  It's been fun. ",
