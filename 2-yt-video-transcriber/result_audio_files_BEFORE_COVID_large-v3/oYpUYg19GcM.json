I think during Watergate, James Slazinger, the Secretary of Defense, issued an order saying any nuclear order, any military order that comes to the White House, I have to sign off on.  They were worried about the chain of command then.  It's not inconceivable.  Again, he's president, so we're living in an odd world, to say the least.  My sense of the effect he would try to have beyond the White House is there's 34%, 35% of the country that they thought Joe McCarthy was great after he was censured.  That Washington Post poll in 1955, 34% approved of Joe McCarthy even after it was all over.  40% of the country never voted for Franklin Roosevelt.  They couldn't say his name.  They called him that man.  But that's 34, 40 percent.  Right now we're closer to 48, 49.  And I think that the big battle has to be finding people who are actually persuadable and making this case.  We're never going to get some sort of Valhalla of bipartisanship.  We've never had it.  We never will.  But we need a reasonable majority. ",
