            "text": "Dear France, As an American, I want to start by merely stating the obvious truth that there would have been no America without French help and no France without American help.  We remember your shared grief and sympathy after the events of September 11, 2001, so what I'm about to tell you is coming from a friend whose own love of country was made possible by your own love for France.  The Cathedral at Notre Dame is arguably the single most iconic structure in the history of Western civilization.  It's been there through wars and revolutions, through invasions and plagues, and into the crucible of the age of reason that so influenced my nation.  During and immediately after the fire at Notre Dame, we too were stunned with what we assumed was the loss of a structure that was the spindle of Western civilization.  Half a world away, here in California, I felt as though I had somehow personally let down the millions of people who built, paid for, maintained, worshipped in, and visited the cathedral at Notre Dame since ground was broken in 1163.  That's 856 years ago.  So what I'm about to say may shock you, but please hear me out.  This fire has been a tremendous gift to you, the French people, a tremendous gift.  Because while the wood in the ceiling is gone, and with it the iconic spire whose fall into the flames broke the heart of the world, the living essence of the cathedral, the stone, still remains.  The rose windows remain.  The magnificent and graceful flying buttresses which give Notre Dame its magnificent inner openness, they still remain.  Many of the exterior statues that have been removed for the renovation that was underway at the time of the fire, they remain as well.  The altar remains.  Many of the pews remain.  And thanks to the heroic efforts of firemen and priests, virtually all of the priceless relics and works of art remain as well.  So, how can someone call a catastrophe like that a gift?  Well, back when I was learning to fly in gliders in 1991, I was given a much smaller but similar gift.  Having several hours of solo time, I was practicing spot landing accuracy in preparation for my upcoming check ride in order to get my private pilot's license.  I'd put a tablecloth of blue vinyl out where I was intending to touch down.  Looked pretty big on the ground, but as I began my final approach, I simply couldn't find it.  So I was looking down instead of forward.  When I hit the ground hard, hard, hard enough to rattle the fillings in my teeth, and that bounced me up another 15 feet, five meters if you prefer, and with no engine, I wasn't going anywhere but down again.  It was a classic PIO, a pilot-induced oscillation, and at that point, I was simply a passenger slamming into the ground again and again and again.  People came running from everywhere because I had essentially crashed the airplane right on the runway.  I opened the canopy, but I couldn't stand up because my knees were not working.  So I called my flight instructor and told him I'd just crashed the airplane.  He asked if I was hurt.  I told him I was not.  He asked if the glider had suffered structural damage.  No, didn't appear to, no.  He then told me that a good landing is one you can walk away from, and a great landing is one where you get to use the airplane again, which helped me not at all.  But then he said something I will never forget.  Bill, he said gently, because he could hear the shame and embarrassment in my voice.  You have just been given a great gift, and that gift is that you have had the living hell scared out of you, and it didn't cost you anything.  You will never make that mistake again.  And sure enough, over the next thousand hours of flight time, I never had a bad landing again.  My eyes were always down at the end of the runway where they're supposed to be for the following 1,639 times that I've landed an airplane since that day.  It was, in fact, a gift to me, and it's kept me alive in some dicey situations.  The fire of April 15, 2019 is a gift to you, the people of France, and by extension, the rest of all of Western civilization.  It's a gift because that fire was a near-death experience.  We thought Notre Dame and all of the history it represents had completely and forever vanished into the flames, but it turns out.  the heart and soul and bones of the cathedral remain.  Now as I write this, the fire appears to have been a construction accident, and since I firmly believe in the presumption of innocence, that's what I'll continue to believe unless or until new evidence arises.  But what is beyond question is that churches and cathedrals have been vandalized all across France for many years now, but especially since the beginning of 2019.  Catholic churches and cathedrals have had statues smashed, altars thrown to the ground, and crosses made from human excrement smeared on the walls.  Now, since your own government and news agencies, as well as most of those in our own American media, refuse to name the people responsible for these decades of fires, destruction, and desecration, the gang rape and molestation of over a thousand women in Cologne in New Year's Eve of 2015, and all of the rest of the insults, intimidation, and violence that has been visited upon your immaculate landscape and exquisite culture for the past several generations, since no one has the courage to name those perpetrators, I will do it for them.  Listen carefully.  I am specifically excluding the fire at Notre Dame for which, as I write this, there is no evidence of a connection.  Nevertheless, you have, through your generosity and grace, opened the doors of your country to people who not only do not wish to become French, but who in fact believe that France and everything in it belongs to them.  And many, if not most of them, despise you to their core.  These people are radicalized, violent, Muslim extremists.  Now I can speak that truth out loud while you in France can't, because my inborn right to do so cannot be infringed upon by my government.  I'm protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, which is enforced by the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, a document whose survival would not have been possible without the aid of your nation.  So please, I am telling you as a friend that despite what your so-called leaders and so-called journalists say, you are not obligated to perform cultural suicide in order to atone for crimes that you did not commit.  And to have the expectation that guests in your own house will not destroy the furniture, defecate on the carpet, or burn the house down.  Well, that's not racism or fascism.  It is common human decency to expect civilized behavior from those that you have invited to join your civilization.  The remedy to all of this is not violence.  It's not intimidation of innocent people or mob rule of any stripe.  The remedy is to watch and then rewatch the spire of the Cathedral of Notre Dame collapse in flames and feel the shock and the agony of the loss of everything you and all open-hearted and open-minded people hold precious.  The remedy is to vote the liars and conmen who have convinced you that you deserve to suffer these assaults, insults, and humiliations.  Those people need to be voted out into the streets and neighborhoods that they have created but which they refuse to acknowledge, let alone live in.  Above all else, do not allow the politicians that are allowing your country to burn to the ground every single day.  Continue to use your kindness, your decency, and your generosity against you in the pursuit of personal political power, as they try to do with us here in America on a daily basis.  Your courage and your will have been drained and demeaned for half a century now, and they are weakened, but they are not gone.  France is culture.  France is science and music and art.  France is still France for now.  The roof of French culture and identity is burning away, but the foundation of stone remains, and the foundation of courage and will that supported and continues to support the Cathedral of Notre Dame, well, that remains as well.  It's up to you now to summon that courage and that will before it's too late.  before Notre Dame burns again on purpose this time, before the Eiffel Tower is blown into twisted rubble and the flames of the burning Mona Lisa erupt from the windows of the Louvre.
