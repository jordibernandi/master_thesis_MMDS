Now, I go about it in a very different way than many of my competitors.  First, my plan gives everybody access to Medicare.  Everybody.  But if you're happy with the private insurance you've got, my plan would let you stick with it, if you want.  Now, others say it's Medicare for all or nothing.  I approve this message to say the choice should be yours. ",
