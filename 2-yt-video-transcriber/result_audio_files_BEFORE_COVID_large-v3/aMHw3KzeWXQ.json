I don't speak the language.  He is a somewhat infamous Muslim apologist who also has a lot more subscribers than I do.  And I get to use them both in the title and thumbnail of this video.  Look at me.  I'm learning the art of clickbait.  And I know it's working.  Because you're watching this video you fell for it.  Anyhow, I'm not too familiar with neither Alex's nor Muhammad's work.  I Spend too much time watching anime So I don't know a whole lot about exactly what each person believes or the things that they have said in their work.  so forgive me if I misspeak.  on behalf of one of these individuals and Alex may or may not post his own response to the video that I'm responding to now.  As of when I'm recording this, he hasn't, but I'm going to respond to it anyway.  But what am I responding to?  Well, I'm glad I assumed you asked that question.  Both Muhammad and Alex were in a debate, and this debate you can find on Muhammad's channel.  And, in typical Muhammad Hijab fashion, he has taken a snippet of this debate, sort of secluded it from the rest of it, and posted it in its own video.  And I'm going to respond to what is in that particular video.  And now, of course, this is going to be an isolated example of something that Muhammad feels that he really got the atheist good on, and this is... This is pretty much just what he does.  Now, if you were to take this video and have only seen these parts of it... ",

I mean, where on this side does Alex say that there is only one necessary existence, or a necessary being, and where does he say that all things are caused by such a necessary existence?  Nowhere.  In fact, he doesn't even say that there are contingent things.  Furthermore, Muhammad Hijab never explains how or why a necessary existence explains absolutely everything.  Notice as well how he never gives Alex a chance to properly explain what sort of necessary existence he believes in or why he believes in it.  From the limited content of his that I've seen, this seems to be a pretty common tactic from Muhammad.  That is to say something pretty vague and arbitrary that you can both agree on. ",
