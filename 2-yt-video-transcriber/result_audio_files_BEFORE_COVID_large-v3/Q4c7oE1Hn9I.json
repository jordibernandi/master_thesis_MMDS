            "text": "yo hello all right we're here.  what's going on guys?  how are y'all living?  it is a wonderful monday evening.  i'm out here in la.  what's up?  latex red that's a hell of a name.  my kids out here.  well be careful buddy.  what do you got?  what are those?  what are those you got?  leaves excuse me i'm out here.  the kids in the backyard just picking up leaves.  what's up?  t you need chapstick buddy.  all right how y'all living man?  um i just wanted to tell me the rabbit ran away.  yes the rabbits ran away and don't put that in your mouth.  what is that in your mouth?  that That's gum.  What are you doing with gum?  It ain't gum.  Sorry, guys.  They have my page shadowed, man.  I know.  Let everybody know to follow me here.  Let everybody know to follow me here.  I wanted to touch on the Kickstarter campaign.  I wanted to touch on that.  For those who don't know, and I just made a post.  See this right here?  Get some juice.  I wanted to touch on the Kickstarter campaign.  Kickstarter just indiscriminately suspended the campaign today.  We raised $30,000 in one weekend.  The campaign was going great.  For those who don't know, we're having a campaign, crowdfunding campaign for the Foundation of Black American Conference that we're going to have down in Atlanta.  We plan on having it for 2020.  This was going to be, and it is, and I'm not going to talk about it in the past tense.  We're still going to get this thing popping.  We got the momentum of this thing was killing the game.  The goal is $200,000.  We're still going to get that.  We relaunched on Indiegogo.  But they saw the momentum.  We got $30,000 in one weekend.  So they saw the momentum.  They saw... how we're about to get down and make some real moves here.  And them and some of the agent provocateurs went and they probably did some kind of flagging campaign, some of the provocateurs and Kickstarter, which I really don't like working with Kickstarter.  They suspended it.  They used some old I might not say so bullshit to suspend the Kickstarter.  Now, everybody got their money back, by the way.  So everybody got their money back.  But the fact that we are talking about... Our agenda on our own terms and people are acting like this, this shows you.  this is something we need to do.  The minute we start talking about getting on our own agenda.  Now, look, they've been having these little bullshit meetings, the revolt conference and all that boule bullshit.  They've been having that left and right.  Nobody says nothing.  So that just shows you.  that shows you that.  These Boulay folks and these corporate sponsored niggas, their agenda is to get your mind and your conversation away from a black agenda.  They have no problem with black folks meeting as long as white people are funding it and as long as the agenda is going to be anything but black folks shit.  The minute we start talking about doing something on our own terms, Kickstarter came up with some bogus reason to take the campaign down.  You dig?  And, you know, we can say that it's this person, that person, but these little random niggas on the internet, they ain't that damn powerful.  These are provocateurs.  The minute we launched the campaign, notice all of these sleeper cells just came out mad about it.  These aren't random haters.  I told people, don't think that certain niggas out here just hate.  These are agent provocateurs.  These are niggas laying in wait, just waiting on us to make a big move.  And the minute we make a big move, all of a sudden, things start getting flagged.  All of this stuff starts happening.  You understand?  So the campaign has a lot of momentum.  We relaunched on Indiegogo.  I want everybody to go to Indiegogo and re-contribute, re-contribute to it because this is something that we need to do.  They do not want us talking about our own agenda.  And let me tell you, some multiple things happened today.  This is why this is not random haters.  I'm telling you, because the same time News One, which is an off, which they're the minions of the white corporations.  News One and all of these other Negro publications, they came out with an article today.  complaining about that Harriet movie.  This was organized.  This was completely organized sabotage.  This was 100% organized.  Did y'all see that thing I put about News 1?  News 1, and I told people last night this was kind of going to happen.  There's going to be a backlash because of the Harriet movie flopping.  That Harriet movie flopped.  So now... They've sent their Negro minions to attack black people.  So News 1 put out an article today just shitting on black people.  And you know they named me in the article.  They had to throw, they really saved some hate for me.  They blamed me for the Harriet movie flop.  And I knew they were going to pull that bullshit.  It ain't my fault.  that shit flopped.  They were in the article, oh, that fucking Tariq Nasheed.  Why do people listen to him?  So all of this in the same day.  They canceled the campaign.  The white funded media, they're attacking me about this Harriet movie.  So they're like, this nigga is too goddamn influential.  They're like, this nigga is way too influential.  You dig?  These folks don't have time to act like they're not on some white supremacist shit.  Stop throwing dirt on them.  They don't even have time to pretend that they're not on some anti-black white supremacist campaign.  you dig the fact that we are getting on code.  the way we're getting on code it has.  these people shook.  and let me say this and i'm gonna be very.  i'll be very honest.  it's very discouraging sometimes because it's it's hard enough trying to organize an event.  It's hard enough organizing an event, getting your staff together, getting an organization panel together, getting all the speakers lined up, getting all of the technicalities lined up, and then on top of that, you got white supremacists and their goddamn minions working behind the scenes trying to undermine the whole damn project.  You dig?  So... You know, that can be disheartening sometimes.  But I learned something from my brother, Brother Kaba.  And I want to have Brother Kaba at the event.  I'm not going to be discouraged because you know what?  When we were going through the same thing, when we released Hidden Colors, every time we do something on our own, we're always attacked.  Remember, the day after Hidden Colors came out, I got banned from a whole damn country.  There was a big screening that was supposed to be out there.  Brother Kaba was already on his way out there.  And Brother Cabba did an interview talking about me being banned and how they were trying to sabotage the movie and how the odds were against us.  But Brother Cabba, in an interview, he said, you know what?  When all the odds were against us, when the powers that be, when they were attacking us and trying to sabotage the screening, he said, I said to myself, what would Harriet do?  What would Harriet, what our sister Harriet, what our warrior sister Harriet do?  Would she stop and throw in the towel?  Would she be discouraged because these white supremacists are attacking?  And that brother, when he said that, that was very powerful to me.  So he kept on.  He wasn't going to turn around.  He went out there.  We ended up giving him a copy of the Blu-ray.  So he was the one who actually took the Blu-ray out to the UK.  We had to damn smuggle the damn movie in the country.  And we had a screening, and the screening was great out there, even though I was not allowed to go out there.  But that's kind of been my mantra.  What would Harriet do?  What would our ancestors do against these white supremacist saboteurs?  You understand?  I'm going to keep on doing the right thing.  Dude, we hit $30,000.  And one weekend, we just launched the campaign Friday.  It was at $30,000 today.  And they were like, no, let's just pull the plug on this.  They didn't even give a real legitimate reason either.  They didn't even give a legitimate reason as to why Kickstarter took that thing down.  Let me tell you something about Kickstarter.  And I never worked with Kickstarter.  Again, I've had problems with Kickstarter before.  They own some low-key racist shit anyway.  When we were doing the Ism Radio travel show where we were getting just a few dollars for travel expenses to go around the country to highlight black businesses, which we did and it was successful, Kickstarter was acting real funny about that.  Kickstarter was on some funny style shit as far as that.  So anytime we try to get a project going with them that has anything to do with some kind of black empowerment, they always have a damn problem with it.  Kickstarter is full of shit.  Nigga, do you know Kickstarter, and I posted this on my Twitter, they let white people make money on that thing for any project.  They let them put up any type of project on there and make all types of money, no matter how ridiculous the project is.  There is a project on Kickstarter, and I put this on my Instagram, on my Twitter.  Well, white dude raised $55,000 to make some potato salad.  You hurt your eye?  What happened?  All right.  All right.  You're all right.  I had to give him a it's okay hug.  But Kickstarter let this dude... All he did was say, hey, I'm making some potato salad and I need $50,000.  And he raised $55,000 to make potato salad.  I swear to God.  You dig?  They let these people, one dude made some money to film bumblebees in his backyard.  They let this dude make $100,000 to film some damn bumblebees.  Dude.  They let these people do anything to get money on there, no matter how stupid it is.  But the minute we want to do something that's going to be empowered.  Oh, no, just this dude wanted to make some nasty ass potato salad.  But some of these white supremacist minions, they went on a flagging campaign.  And the fact that Kickstarter allowed them to do that, that shows something.  And understand, these provocateurs going on a flagging campaign, these are... Sorry about that, guys.  Sorry, my phone rang.  Sorry about that, guys.  So every look, so let me say this.  So I'll probably go live on YouTube later.  But listen, we got the thing back on Indiegogo.  You can go to Indiegogo, type in Foundation of Black American Convention.  We're still going to keep pushing.  We're not going to let these people deter us because we have a right to talk about our damn agenda without all the interventions of some corporate people who are just going to sit around and make sure we talk about nothing burgers.  You understand?  So we're going to keep this thing going.  Everybody go to Indiegogo.  Type in Foundational Black American.  I know we got people in here trolling.  Don't worry about that.  They stay in here.  They monitor what we're doing all the time.  They monitor what we're doing all the time.  Also... Some of y'all follow me on the Melanoid 300 on Facebook.  The Melanoid 300 page on Facebook.  That's a private group.  So I have to screen you before I let you in there.  We have a lot of good conversations on there.  But again, you can go to Foundation of Black America and our website, FBAC2020.com.  FBAC2020.com.  So everybody donate, man.  I'll talk to y'all later tonight. ",
