            "text": "Hello everybody, welcome to this new video.  My name is Adam.  I look like a mess.  I need to shower.  I'm not binding, but this is me.  Deal with it.  So the thing is, today we're gonna be talking and asking the question of do all trans people that are famous have to be activists and have to speak up for trans rights?  so the thing about it is I have quite like two opinions.  I think it's so nice to have social responsibility.  I think it's so nice to talk about the rights of people that cannot speak for themselves whether they are in dangerous situations or whatever.  just by you speaking up their parents might see it.  you might change a lot of people's perspectives on this and you're gonna help them.  but do I realistically think that everyone has social responsibility?  I do not think so.  Also, it gets a little bit tricky in a sense of like, I don't like the idea that trans people, all of them have to be like politically woke or politically liberal or just all trans people having to belong to one thing.  You know, that is the... kind of thought that I always try to argue with.  I do not agree.  I think trans people come in all shapes and forms.  I always say this.  If you are conservative and you're trans, you are still trans.  You are not less trans.  I don't like the idea of Trans people, like when you say trans people, you imagine them all to be androgynous or you imagine them all to be passive.  These are the two extremes.  I don't agree with neither.  I think we can be anything.  I think it takes a lot to get to this.  quite like open-minded mindset, if that makes sense.  Literally, trans people are just like anyone else.  They just happen to be trans.  That is the idea that I personally adopt, but I feel like being trans became more than being trans with time.  It became more.  It's, I don't know, I feel like it took one specific stereotype.  Again, I don't like that.  I think trans people can be religious and cannot be religious, can be passing, cannot be passing, can be activists, cannot be activists, can be smart, cannot be smart, can be good looking, cannot be good looking.  Exactly.  That is the point.  They are like anyone else.  a lot of trans people kind of want to set us, or trans activists want to set us quite apart from the rest.  We are trans, we are not like everyone else in a lot of senses, but yeah, we do have experiences that are not like others, but we are just going through life like anyone else, and we have our struggles that are not necessarily trans-related.  I get that being trans is very important in our journey.  I mean, who are you talking to?  I flew the world for being trans, technically, and it's a very important part.  It's like if I don't mention me being trans, talking about my past is going to be a little mysterious.  I think there is a new trans movement that agrees with me, which is good.  And there is a trans movement that is the opposite of what I think and that just wants to make us all look like one thing.  I don't agree, that's all.  I don't think anybody can or should be an activist or politically involved if they don't have the intellectual knowledge that comes with it, you know?  Anyway, thank you guys for watching this video, and let me know, do you think all trans people that are famous have to be activists and have to speak up about all of these issues?  I'm curious to know, and I hope I'm not the only one that thinks whatever the hell I'm thinking.  And it's okay.  if you don't agree with me, just let me know.  I'll see you in another video.  Bye!
