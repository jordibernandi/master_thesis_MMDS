I've kind of been in other places the past couple of weeks.  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  I wasn't.  I was right here, sir.  I was three feet off the curb.  You could have went around me, sir.  I wasn't in the roadway.  I was three feet off the curb, sir.  I was three feet off the curb.  I was three feet off the curb.  I can be off the curb if I want.  Thank you, sir.  I'm just letting you know you don't have to tell me non-lawful orders.  I wasn't in the middle of the road, sir.  I'll get these FOIA requests and I'll prove I wasn't.  I never go on tirades.  You're coming at me with an attitude.  Lower your voice.  No, I'm going to do the same exact energy you give me.  You came up and yelled at me.  Go ahead.  This is an emergency entrance and exit.  When you're blocking it, vehicles come in and out.  Okay?  Don't stand here.  That's all I'm asking you.  I was not in the middle of the road, sir.  Okay.  You could have went around me.  You're recording.  Okay, thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  Next time, what?  Next time, we're blocking the roadway.  Sir, I wasn't blocking the roadway, sir, once again.  All right, have a good day.  Yeah, thank you.  Guys, literally, look it, look it.  That's where I was, two feet off the curb.  Two feet off the curb.  Look how big and wide open this is.  Look at this, I was two feet off the curb.  He wants to be a dick.  Can I get a complaint for him, please?  Can I get a complaint for him?  He's training in Oklahoma.  Yeah.  And then he doesn't know after that.  Yes.  I used to have to walk her back to get them.  Now they have them right close by.  I guess they don't have them close by.  More copies?  Thank you.  Just a question.  Do pedestrians have the right of way out front here?  What do you mean?  Do pedestrians have the right of way out here?  Say if we happen to be standing there for two seconds.  No, listen, don't call me Mattson, okay?  Don't call me Mattson.  You call me Thomas.  Yeah, yeah, listen to your captain, exactly.  No, listen to your captain.  See, that's the type of tyrants we need.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  That's what I have to deal with around here.  That crap.  Trying to have altercations.  Punks.  Continue to give me gold. ",
