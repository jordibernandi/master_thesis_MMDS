            "text": "In the beginning, XOXO was just a conference and festival, but over the last seven years, it has become a community of thoughtful, caring, and talented people.  And we are so, so happy that you're here.  You know I feel like the world got smaller.  I recall all of the days I've cried.  Even if heaven doesn't take us, we tried.  Make whatever it is you want to make, even if people think it's stupid.  If you feel it, I mean really feel that shit in your chest, put it out there, and the people will come because they're there.  So we joined a whole bunch of folks like us who push for better representation.  We've emboldened each other to demand more from the industry that we love, all for the sake of telling better, richer stories.  The way that I am here, I'm creating this space.  I'm making it so that other people like me can step in.  They can take up more space.  If I'm putting myself out there and I feel any pride at all in what I've done, does that mean I'm all in it for myself?  That this is only for me just because I'm proud of what I do?  And the answer is no, of course.  This is a life-defining thing that we get to do.  There is an inherent risk in standing up for your friends and colleagues who are being attacked by bad and often dangerous people.  Do it anyway, because the alternative is silence.  Those conversations will be the little bricks that we lay bit by bit to build a better, more empathetic world together.  It's easy to believe that you're on your own here, but it turns out that we're actually not alone.  I'm yours.  I'm yours.  I'm yours.  I'm yours.  I'm yours.  You get to make somebody laugh or you get to make somebody think, but that's all you have to do is just shine a light on humanity because it's still out there.  We're in here right now.  It's going to be great because it already is.  Thank you. ",
