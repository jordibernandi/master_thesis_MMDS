            "text": "Because if you don't have degrees, you won't get the cheese.  So Shaquille O'Neal, who actually owns, I think Shaquille owns about, I think he owns 10% of Papa John's, not Papa John's, sorry, Five Guys, the Five Guys restaurants.  Shaquille O'Neal, the former NBA player, owns 10% of Five Guys, right?  And so he's amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in wealth.  He makes a ton of money.  He probably makes more money now than he did when he was playing basketball.  He told his kids, if you don't get the certifications necessary to manage my money, you're not going to get access to my money because I worked too hard for this.  Ultimately, I think it's okay.  I think it makes sense for you to put those stipulations in for your children.  You can do that through wills and trusts and proper estate planning.  You may have seen some of these high-profile stories recently where you've got celebrities who are dying without a will.  Even Nipsey Hussle, as brilliant as he was, died without a will, so his brother had to go to the judge and ask the judge for permission to manage his estate, right?  So think about this.  Because there's no will in place, you know, his brother has to go ask this stranger for the right to access his family's money.  And so what I would say to you is, That estate planning matters.  Understanding the benefits of trust and all these things matters.  If you understand this stuff really well, what you find is that you can not only control and protect your money now, you can also control and protect your money after you're gone.  and make sure that, you know, that your family corporation is strong and survives long term.  You know, that's where these billion dollar companies come from.  You know, you look at, you know, what is it?  Oh gosh, I think it's General Electric.  Who was it?  Was it Alexander Graham Bell associated with the creation of General Electric?  Or was it some, it was one of those guys, or Thomas Edison.  I think it's Thomas Edison, right?  Thomas Edison's been gone a long time, but GE is still here and is very, very strong, right?  Ford, Henry Ford died a long time ago.  but Ford is still here and it's very, very strong, right?  You can keep going down with.  Sam Walton died a long time ago.  Walmart is stronger than ever.  How does that happen?  How does that happen?  How does Walmart, how's Walmart?  a creation of Sam Walton stronger after his death than it was when he was here.  It's because he has procedures and protocols in place to protect that family fortune.  It's because he put something there that allows his company to function even when he's not there.  He's able to make more money as a dead person than he made when he was alive because of systems.  So one of the things I'll tell you guys as we keep moving forward in this masterclass is that if you're going to teach your children how to make money, teach them how to make money with systems.  Don't teach them just how to make money with labor.  Labor is very, very temporary.  Systems can last forever.  So the people that have big money, that's one thing I've noticed is they make money with systems because systems don't get tired.  Systems can make money while you're asleep.  Systems can make money if you're disabled.  Systems can make money if you're dead.  Systems allow you to make money from the use of other people's labor, other people's time.  As long as you fairly compensate them for their time, they'll be glad to go and help you build your empire.  So if you look at that in two ways, right?  You've got the wealth owners and then you've got the wealth builders and wealth creators that are actually doing the work to build the wealth.  We tend to be on that side of those who are building and creating wealth for other people and that wealth is transferring to people who have built systems that allow them to amass wealth even beyond the grave, okay?  So that's it.  I'm going to go guys.  I hope you guys enjoyed the first day of the masterclass. ",
