            "text": "Salam to the family.  Welcome to another quick impromptu edition of Maccabees TV.  It's your brother Priest Daniala.  Just came to repost a video that I saw trending today throughout the day.  Very interesting.  I wanted to share it with the audience in case some of you brothers and sisters are living under a rock and you didn't see it.  You brothers and sisters see the name of the video.  The name of the video is called The Only People That Don't Know The Real Jews Are Black Is The Fake Woke unconscious community.  I'm going to say that again.  The only people on the planet Earth that do not know that the real Jews of Black are these fake woke conscious Negroes.  Okay?  Now, shout out to GMS Watchmen.  I want to give credit to the brother whose page I saw this on.  I couldn't find the original video.  But I thought it was powerful enough that I think you brothers and sisters would want to see it.  if you didn't see it.  Right.  So shout out to him.  He has the original video.  So this is his video.  I want to give him credit for his video.  The name of the video is called The Controversy of Zion.  Nick Cannon talks Hebrew Israelites with Professor Griff.  So in this video, you have Nick Cannon and Professor Griff.  Nick Cannon has something called Cannon's class where he sits down with different people and interviews them.  And I guess this is one that's going to come out soon, or maybe it came out already.  I couldn't find the original.  But let's listen.  It's a video that's about a minute and 11 seconds, and that's all we need.  Let's go. ",
