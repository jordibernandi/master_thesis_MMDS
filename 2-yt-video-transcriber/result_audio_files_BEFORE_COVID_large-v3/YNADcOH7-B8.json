            "text": "Hello everybody.  This video was originally supposed to come out after Philip DeFranco linked my channel which gave me a bunch of new subs.  I was gonna try to explain why someone would be a socialist nowadays to people who may have never considered socialism as a possibility.  Probably because most people learn in school that the soviet union was bad and from this they take that socialism must be bad.  This script kinda ended up being a political journey video though.  I wanted to explain why I had these beliefs and for that I'd have to explain many personal things.  I decided that the political journey video was too egocentrical and left the word file to rot on my hard drive along with some other scrap projects.  When I posted an image of those doomed projects someone suggested I hold a poll where I let the viewers vote on which ones I should continue.  I did so and a surprisingly high amount of people wanted to see this.  So here we go, this is my political journey.  I've always been interested in politics for as long as I can remember.  I remember back in elementary school when I learned about the political parties and what they stand for.  Neatly every party in Austria has a colour associated with it which I promptly learned.  At the time we had 3 big parties, the left wing workers party which was the red one, the centrist christian conservative party which was black and the right wing anti-immigrant party which was blue.  I grew up going to school with some muslims and immigrants so I am resistant to the right wing scaremongering about those groups and never really liked the right wing in their xenophobic views.  To me those were the parties and I didn't have any preferences beside that.  They seemed like equally good parties to me and they stayed for that for some time.  At 14 I went to business school in which I learned the basics about the free market, supply and demand and such.  I also learned that the free market has upsides and downsides like everything in life.  On the one hand it gives us plenty of models of cars to choose from while promoting inhumane working conditions.  on the other hand.  But that didn't matter to me at the time.  I was in trouble because my grades were too bad to stay in that school.  I wasn't that interested in learning about accounting anyway so I got a job in a factory.  For this you have to know that in Austria there is a system derived from medieval apprenticeship in which people as young as 15 can work in the heavy industry.  I quickly noticed that working sucks and having a money hungry boss who tries to illegally make you work overtime sucks even more.  Of course at this time my politics changed as well since I became close to being 16, which is the age at which you are allowed to vote in Austria.  I read all of the party manifestos and learned what they were about.  I didn't have many issues that were important to me at the time.  I learned that the conservative party wanted to legalize a 12 hour work day which was an immediate no go for me.  I don't know if you've ever worked in a loud hot uncomfortable factory before and honestly I hope you don't have to, but take my word, working 8 hours a day is long enough.  For me this was enough of a reason not to vote for them.  So I had to take a choice between the red and the blue party, which are both considered workers parties.  The right wing party ran on a platform of deregulating the free market and cutting things like unemployment benefits.  From my time in business school I knew that deregulating the market can be very dangerous.  For example, rolling back food regulations may allow for more and cheaper food but it might also lead to someone using unhealthy methods of preservation and preparation of the food.  Of course, I didn't know why they wanted to do this but that along with their xenophobic rhetoric was enough of a reason not to vote for them.  And that's how I voted for the first time.  Not based on what I believed was the best but based on avoiding what I believed was the worst.  I'm sure many of you, especially in America, can relate to that.  And honestly I didn't think that politics was that important either.  It never impacted my life in any way so it wasn't a big deal.  In reality I didn't feel like there was much that could be done.  Then over the internet I became more familiar with critiquing capitalism.  ContraPoints' video series titled what's wrong with capitalism really helped me open my mind towards accepting that capitalism may not be the perfect system.  I imagined it was.  I've never been a great advocate of the free market or something like that but I assumed that it was the only system around.  People trade, people engage in wage labour, that's just how it is.  And I still thought about it like that even when the people on youtube pointed out their flaws.  I was happy to critique capitalism but I didn't think we could replace it because at the time I couldn't imagine the practical way production could be organised differently.  I knew what wage labour was and yes, I think that it was not fair that the boss gets to make way more money for working an easier job for fewer hours a day.  but I didn't have an understanding of how it could be better.  My solution at the time was voting social democrats.  Advocate for a higher minimum wage, increase unemployment benefits and even better give a universal basic income to everyone to allow people to live a good life even if the automatisation made half of the world unemployed.  This seemed like the solution to me.  But then I learned more.  I watched speeches by Dr.  Richard Wolff who is the most prominent Marxist professor in the US right now.  He explained many things I never thought about like that.  He explained how every employer-employee relationship has to be exploitative to work.  If you don't know what I mean watch this video, I made it on the topic some time ago.  And then Dr.  Wolf explained the most important thing to me.  He didn't just continue to name the faults of capitalism like Brad Tutten's do, he named an alternative system.  He laid out how a seemingly small change in the way businesses are run could have great impact on the ways we live and the future of the economy.  What was the change he proposed?  Democracy.  Democracy in the workplace and not just in the state.  What really has an impact on your life isn't what happens in the national parliament way over in the capital.  What really makes a difference is what happens at your workplace.  Think about it.  You spend 8 hours a day at your workplace.  Wouldn't it make sense for you to have some control over what happens there?  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to vote for who your boss is or how the factory is going to be run?  It doesn't seem like that big a deal I'll admit, it sounds pretty easy to implement actually.  But allowing people to vote on policies would reduce the amount of money paid to investors and CEOs.  If automatization would come along it wouldn't put half of the people out of their jobs anymore, it would just halve the amount of time everyone had to work.  I liked this idea.  The only problem I had with it was what it's called.  Because by definition the ownership of the workplace going to the workers is called socialism.  And that word really kept me away from it.  Not because I was scared of socialism or because I confused workplace democracy with stalinism but because others would do it.  Because if I explained that I like socialism I'd be expected to explain how I justified that Stalin killed 200 trillion people.  This kept me with the social democrats for a while.  I thought they were the best bet of politically achieving something.  The only party that demanded workplace democracy at the time was the communist party of Austria, the KPU, which didn't get seats in parliament since Austria's independence from the occupying forces in 1955.  I stuck with the social democrats for some more time until one day I heard of something that happened.  The red black coalition that had ruled the parliament until then was broken up by the chancellor and leader of the black party.  Yes, it's the guy who destroyed two governments and caused snap elections both times.  This was still his first time.  When the coalition broke every party could vote for what they wanted to independently until the next election and all parties could bring in suggestions for laws they wanted to adopt.  The green party brought in a proposal that would legalize gay marriage in Austria.  The social democrats had legalization of gay marriage as a major point in their manifesto.  But they could never do it and stated that the conservatives they worked with didn't allow it.  However, since the coalition just spoke there were enough seats in parliament supporting this proposal.  The green party, the social democrats and the neoliberals all theoretically supported the bill and had enough votes to make it law.  But they didn't.  The social democratic party voted against the thing they had promised they would do.  The green party and the neoliberals had nowhere enough seats to get it through and the will died.  At this point I realised how futile supporting the moderates was.  It was obvious to me that they hadn't supported it because they didn't want to anger the conservative party with whom they hoped to work after the next election.  That was when I realized that the social democratic party had betrayed what they stood for in order to work with those who opposed their goals.  At this point the Austrian social democrats were dead to me.  I also began to see how the conservatives and the far right party had only made laws for the rich while getting voted with cheap scaremongering.  I saw the depressing reality that the party I hoped would do good didn't do that.  I had to look for a new party to vote for.  I decided that the communist party, the one that never gets any votes because its name and its history remind people of stalinism, is the best one there is.  And at the time I began to read more theory.  I read capitalist realism, why marx was right, das kapital and I began to look at the history of socialist thought.  I learned about the Paris Commune and the russian revolution and I noticed that I was getting more and more radical.  My demands for a universal basic income were replaced with demands for workplace democracy and my demands for the rich to pay their taxes was replaced with demands that billionaires return the money they stole from the workers.  I wasn't sure if that was right.  If being radical was good.  After all I was told many times that radicalism is dangerous.  But looking at the world through the Marxist lens made it obvious that many problems we have are due to capitalism.  Child workers, unemployment, homelessness, food waste, plastic waste, climate change, inequality, economic crises and many more are the result of the rules the free market places on individuals.  I can't go back to supporting a social democratic party that ignores the root of those problems.  Yes, increasing the minimum wage reduces inequality but it only reduces the symptoms.  If you want to root out inequality you have to give the responsibility of produced value to the people who produced it.  Yes, banning that companies throw away edible food helps with waste but as long as they support a system in which throwing away food is financially rewarded the problem will never be eradicated.  Carbon taxes are cute but they are no match for the profit incentives of fossil fuel industries.  And now here I am, cursed with the knowledge that every boss I'll ever have will do nothing but steal from me.  I am damned towards knowing that most problems that exist on this planet do so because of the free market and even more damned knowing that most people will never realize this enough to do something about it.  Being a Marxist is hard because I know where the problems come from but I also know that most don't know about them or don't care about them.  So that's it, that's where I am.  I am a Marxist with the dreams of a socialist utopia.  Or at least a world in which we don't waste one third of the food that's produced.  You may have noticed that I didn't mention any anarchist influence in my ideology and I didn't read anarchist theory yet either.  I am not much of an anarchist but my opinions on anarchism are worth a video on its own.  In short, I think we can learn many practical things from questioning and resisting authority from anarchist philosophy.  But true anarchist society seems impossible to reach, at least for now.  As I mentioned I haven't read much theory on it so don't crucify me yet.  Anyways, thanks for watching, be sure to tell me your political journey in the comments, I'd love to read that, I really do.
