Secretary Esper, prior to becoming Army Secretary, you were the top lobbyist for Raytheon, which of course is the nation's third largest defense contractor.  Now, under current ethics rules, you're prohibited from participating in any decisions involving Raytheon for two years after your appointment as Army Secretary.  But because you have already been in government for 20 months, that recusal period is set to expire in November.  which means you will soon be able to participate personally and substantially in matters involving your former employer.  That's a conflict of interest given that Raytheon does billions of dollars worth of business every year with the Defense Department.  So, Secretary Esper, your predecessor, Acting Secretary Shanahan, committed to extend his recusal from all matters involving his former employer, Boeing, for the duration of his government service.  If you're confirmed, will you do the same and commit to extending your recusal from any and all matters involving Raytheon for the duration of your tenure as Secretary of Defense? ",

Now the law prohibits you from participating in matters that would affect Raytheon's ability or willingness to hand you this massive payout.  But there's a catch.  In a recent memo, you detailed an exception to your ethics obligations by writing that you can get a waiver to participate in matters that directly and predictably affect Raytheon's financial interests if it's, quote, so important that it cannot be referred to another official, end quote.
