Pretending like atheists haven't provided solid reasons not to believe in your God is disingenuous at best.  As for being the cool in thing, there are currently 13 countries where you could be given the death penalty for being an atheist.  all of the Muslim-majority countries.  In many other places, like Bangladesh, you can be dragged from your place of business and hacked to pieces for blasphemy.  Not that this barbarity is reserved just for atheists.  You could be killed for campaigning on behalf of the LGBT plus community or for belonging to a minority religious group.  Even in secular countries, atheists are often surrounded by religious people.  They often live in a society where religion is given a privileged status, and where they're told by superstitious preachers like you that we have no reason to live, no reason or way of telling right from wrong, or that the only way to live a happy, meaningful life is to believe in your god and your dogma.  Despite all these personal and societal pressures, despite religiously motivated fear tactics, shaming, and sometimes outright violence, these people don't believe in your god or any other god. ",

You grow up in a society where you're being told there's only one correct way of thinking about something.  When you find someone who doesn't, you find it surprising that they might feel anxious or troubled.  For example, most of us are taught that we will live on after death.  Some people don't believe that, but they have very few support systems that they can turn to that are able to help them through the death of a loved one.  Of course, they're more likely to struggle with their feelings when it comes to death and dying.  You also make it sound as if depression and substance abuse only happen within atheist communities.  You don't think there are people who turn to drinking because they're afraid of hell, or afraid that their family will find out that they don't believe in your deity and will shun them because of it?  You don't think your religion drives people to feel depressed over their sexual orientation or for any deviation in thinking outside of the religious norm?  Stop pretending as though your video is fueled by concern for atheists.  Anyhow, that about wraps up my response to this video.  However, I do have one more thing to run by you.

A couple weeks ago, we were shown messages from the landlord claiming that the place was being shut down and everybody was about to be evicted.  So far, there hasn't been any official eviction notice, which means we have more time than we initially thought, but honestly, we still need to move.  Even discounting how difficult it is for me to record with paper thin walls and other people here, the place just isn't safe.  There are outlets so loose that they melt cords, there are visible gaps where the walls and ceiling connect to each other, and there's a weak board in the bathroom, and that's just naming a few of the things inside.  Outside, we can only use one door at all, and even that porch, the stairs aren't in good condition, but at least they exist.  We even had to rig a light just to be able to see to come and go through the front door at night, because there was nothing here.  We have a fundraiser going on that would cover the initial costs to get a house.  The link to that is going to be in the description as well as a pinned comment.  But even if we don't reach the full goal, just getting a couple thousand would open up far more possibilities than we have right now.  I understand that not everybody can donate.  I mean, I see a lot of these things when I have no ability to help out either.  If you have the ability to donate a little, or even could just spread the word so that maybe others can, it would be greatly appreciated. ",
