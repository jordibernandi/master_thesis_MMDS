The New World Order, or the Committee 300, was set up, and I'm going to read you something out of this excellent, excellent book, Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse, and it is by Dr.  Enid Horowitz and Dr.  Joseph Puglio.  A brilliant book, may I say.  On page 107... Here we've got, under a title, Cecil Rhodes and his New World Order Scholars.  On February the 5th, which it is today, 1891, several wealthy Englishmen, Lord Rothschild included, joined Cecil Rhodes to found the Committee of 300.  The main objective of the group was to promulgate a worldwide British plutocracy.  The committee structured itself After the Society of Jesus, the Jesuit order, later Hitler's SS would do the same.  In Rhodes' own words, here's what the Committee of 300 intended and why.  Accordingly, he speaks out, there is a destiny now possible to us, the highest ever set before a nation to be accepted or refused.  We are still under-generate in race, a race mingled of the best northern blood.  We are not yet dissolute in temper, but still have the firmness to govern and the grace to obey.  We have been taught a religion of pure mercy.  which we must either now betray or learn to defend by fulfilling, and we are rich in an inheritance of honour bequeathed to us through a thousand years of noble history, which it should be our daily thirst to increase with splendid avarice, so that Englishmen, if it be a sin to covet honour, should be the most offended souls ",

Look again at the extra-employment a new country added to our dominion gives.  i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race and otherwise would not be brought into existence.  In Rhodes' first will and testimony, he gave his purpose more specific.  The extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration that the United Kingdom and of colonisation by British subject of all lands wherein means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise, and especially the occupation by British settlers of the entire continent of Africa, the holy land the valley of the euphrates the island of cyprus and candida the whole of south america the islands of the pacific not heretofore possessed by great britain the whole of the Malay archipelago, the seaboard of China and Japan, the ultimate recovery of the United States of America, and an integral part of the British Empire, the consolidation of the whole empire, the inauguration of a system of colonial representation in the imperial parliament, which may tend to weld together the disjointed members of the empire and finally the foundation of so great a power as to hereafter render wars impossible and promote the best interests of humanity ",

Much of what is known about Cecil Rhodes also came from eminent scholar and historian Professor Carol Quigley, President Clinton's teacher and mentor at Georgetown University during the mid-1960s.  during Clinton's acceptance speech before the Democratic Presidential Nominating Convention in July 16, 1992. the life members of the masonic order and de mole for boys the future president of the united states proclaimed.  as a teenager i heard john kennedy's summons to citizenship and then as a student at georgetown i heard that call clarified by a professor named carol quigley.  more recently professor quigley's publication which reviewed by dr stanley monteith a medical physician who has extensively published on the threat to american life posed by rhodes's initiatives which have culminated into what is currently termed the new world order.  Dr.  Monteith pointed out that the Rhodes scholars, as most American presidents, including Clinton, have been since Rhodes died, and left his vast diamond and gold mining fortune to his plutocratic cause, were part of the British imperialistic plot in the Anglo-American establishment.  Quigley, obviously a book, Quigley's revelations proved interesting.  a sense of continuity between the Freemasonry practice of forming secret societies, including the skull and bones, and the grooming of American presidents and foreign policies.  The Rhodes Scholarship, established in the terms of Cecil Rhodes' seventh will, are known to everyone.  What is not so widely known is that Rhodes, in five previous wills, left his fortune to form a secret society.  And what does not seem to be known to anyone is that this secret society was created by Rhodes and his principal trustee, Lord Milner, and continued to exist to this day.  In another work highlighting the evolution of President Clinton's role in Rhodes' scheme to undermine America and place the world again under British control in the New World Order, Rhodes' letter to his close friend W.T.  Stead is revealing, In the autumn of 1890, Rhodes wrote, which was a year before he set up the Committee 300, Please remember the key of my idea discussed with you is a society copied from the Jesuits as to organisation in idea.  which ultimately, in square brackets, leads to the cessation of all wars and one language throughout the world.  The only thing feasible to carry this idea out is a secret, in brackets, society, one gradually absorbing the wealth of the world to be devoted to such an object.  Fancy the charm to young America to share in this scheme to take the government of the whole world. ",

So Cecil Rhodes comes after Victoria.  But these things had great influence on these men.  They went to the large public schools, of which paedophilia was... rampant at the time.  So this gives you an idea of where this whole centre of the British and the killing and the murdering of the children that is going on en masse.
