Because if we don't deal with it, you know, it's judgment time and there is some who God really pick.  that some must survive.  So we are called for the survivors, you know, because it's not a joke.

And then other people will know that it is true and deal with it too.  Because what we are dealing with now is something higher.  I mean, it's not what we are dealing with, the reality of what is going to happen.  It's something higher than man's own personal little vexation and pride self.  This is something where no man can stop because all nations are going to gather and all nations are going to say, yes, you're right.  And some plenty will die, you know.  But there is people who want it and know.  it says freedom won, which is the truth, the right to live.  You know?  Which when you check the right to live, the right to live is to have the right vibe.  The right vibe come from Rasta.  You know?  Because it's just so it come, it not come no other way.  It really come from Rasta, the head.  That mean, this is where all people must really deal with.  Because them, themself, I try find the way.  Every day them get up and look on the TV, them read the newspaper.  Them want to see... The truth.  The truth.  But them can't see the truth.  Because the truth will not be found here.

Now in the last flood, when only Noah and them three sons and couple of wives that saved, multiply all of these people.  So it is happening, man.  Right now you have more people, more rasta, more than when Noah did save in the last flood.  So it really happened.  It might be slow, but it is sure.  Yeah, man.  Isn't that a thing where money to frighten money to frighten?  because I see all certain people man I couldn't say well in the Marasta when I just see them another year after what continents changing become real.  you know in change you can't see my like him get the gift of life to blood clad.  you can't see no man directly get the gift of.
