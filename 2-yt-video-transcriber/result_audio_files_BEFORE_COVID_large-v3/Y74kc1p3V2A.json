            "text": "I want to take a few moments and share with you on YouTube because YouTube is not limited.  Sometimes on Facebook, they don't send an alert that we're on to people and they limit, but YouTube, we seem to reach more people this way.  First of all, I'm working on the messages for the main event, which we now call the International Camp Meeting October 1 through 5, which is one of the greatest meetings that we do all year long here at Cleveland, Tennessee.  And we do want you to go to Perrystone.org and get the information and join us, hopefully in all the services, but in as many as you can attend.  There will be... two to three very powerful, very strong prophetic words that will be coming out that I'll be preaching.  One of those has to do with the meaning of the year in the Hebrew calendar, the new year which is coming up, which is very different.  And I'm extremely excited about it.  It's probably out of the eight years that we've been teaching the meaning of the Hebrew year, that this is a powerful, positive, God's about to do something revelation.  That'll be one night during the camp meeting.  But let me talk about last night, we shared this on Facebook, but last night I had a dream.  Sometimes when you type it out, you can't go into the details.  I was on a high mountain, surrounded by mountains, And I won't name the person I was talking to.  They're a very dear friend.  It's an older couple.  They were standing here and I was talking to them.  And they happen to live on the east coast of the United States.  And again, I'll not name the state.  The reason I don't is because some people will hear it and they'll They'll respond or get fearful or panic immediately.  And then we start getting calls, what should I do?  What should I do?  And I've always told people, you have to hear from God yourself.  You have to know the movements of the Lord.  You have to listen to the Holy Spirit because you can't tell someone what to do based on what you feel or you sense.  And I'm talking about myself.  But So Rob and Tammy were on the right side and there were some other people out there with us.  And all of a sudden I heard a rumbling noise.  and the rumbling noise was coming in front of me from a mountain in front of me.  Now this was a huge mountain.  It didn't have any trees on it.  It just was a rock mountain.  And I'll tell you what I think that can represent in a moment.  And I said, oh my goodness, we have to get out of here.  We have to run to the house.  that's on the hill.  And there was a house way in the distance, but we had to go over some places.  I would say some rolling hills, not mountains to get to the house.  And as I'm turning to run and I'm assuming that the people with me are running, the couple that lives on the coast stood where they were.  And I thought, I don't know why they're not coming with us.  I don't know why they're standing there because whatever this is will affect them.  Well, as I'm running, I'm hearing behind me a chorus of voices and it reminded me of 9-11.  Of course, when I'm taping this today, it is 9-11, but it reminded me of 9-11 where when the people were running down the street, if you'll remember the just different cries, a mix, a mix of different cries.  And out of that voice came this word, it's going to change.  You know, things are going to change.  It's going to change.  And it said it once and a few seconds later said it again, a few seconds later said it.  I said it again, I said it three times.  And I'm wondering why out of this course of people, I'm hearing this word, it's going to change.  In other words, what is about to happen is going to change or maybe hopefully they think that it's going to change and not happen.  So I couldn't get clear.  if someone would say, it's going to change, meaning it's not going to happen.  Or someone saying what is about to happen is going to change things.  And I think it was the latter.  I kept going.  And then after hearing for the third time, the choruses, of course, of people just kind of, ah!  you know, yelling, very loud, by the way, from behind the mountain.  I looked behind me and I saw water literally coming over.  It looked like a wave washing over the mountain and coming down the mountain.  And my impression was, it's going to come into this valley.  It's going to come over this mountain.  It's going to come into this valley.  It's going to come over this one.  And I wasn't quite yet to the house when I saw the water.  Now, immediately I woke up.  I woke up with a horrible headache, by the way, because sometimes when you have dreams that are troubling, you'll get various of your headaches.  So I woke up with a headache, and I just laid there for probably 30 minutes, couldn't go back to sleep, and I began to ponder this.  Now, in Scripture, a mountain can represent a nation.  It can represent empire, but it also can represent a nation.  I don't want to go through all the scriptures of the book of Revelation and the book of Daniel that would indicate that.  Then the voices of people crying could be simply the reaction to what is happening.  The fact that things are going to change means that when this happens, things are going to drastically change.  What would change?  Maybe the landscape, maybe economic situations.  I didn't have that clear, but it just meant it was going to change.  The fact that it said it three times could represent to me three states that this would affect.  And I'm only trying to go by what I'd say, not necessarily what the Holy Spirit showed me, but what I feel in my spirit based on past experiences and also based on scripture.  Because this couple is right on the coast of the United States, it's the East Coast, by the way, it made me wonder about something happening on the East Coast, which with that amount of water would only be one or two things.  It would be a hurricane on the level of what hit in the Bahamas coming to the East Coast of the United States.  It could be that.  However, the old expression you've heard older people say, in my gut, down in my gut, or down in my spirit, or my gut, or down in my belly, an inner feeling.  Because of the amount of water and it was a big wave coming in, it reminded me of a tsunami like the one they had in Japan or Indonesia many, many years ago.  And most of you know, if you have kept up with our ministry for years, I have lost track, literally lost track of the number of times, probably two of them were more like a vision, the rest of them had been dreams, that I see tsunamis coming.  And I've seen probably one, say, one, two, three, four, five, five times the East Coast.  I saw one from the Gulf of Mexico, and I saw probably four or five, or six, and again, I'm just going from the top of my head here.  I had to have to sit down and count.  That came from the West Coast of the United States and the others were more global in substance.  I do believe what I'm about to tell you, the Bible says, and I want to preface this by saying I do not consider myself quote unquote a prophet.  I do believe there are people that have prophetic gifts.  I do believe I have a prophetic gift that the Lord gave me based on what I have seen to happen four to five years later.  God had preached it was going to happen.  and it happened four or five years later.  But that doesn't make a person a prophet, that just makes a person someone with a prophetic gift who listens to the Lord and God in His sovereignty shows them things.  But I do believe, based on what I have seen, that the Lord does nothing till He first reveals it to people on earth to be able to speak it and tell people what's coming.  And this happened all through the scripture.  This is tough to say, but I think people should, and I'm not talking about right now, I'm not talking about immediately, but I'm talking about in the weeks or months ahead, if the Lord tarry years ahead, I think people should consider where you're living.  I think you should consider the areas you're going to retire in.  I do believe that I think you can see this, that there are certain states in the United States that are more prone to crime, more prone to disasters, and I think you have to put that in the equation when you're living in an area.  I think that there are very obviously situations that do happen in coastal areas with hurricanes.  On the flip side, Tennessee has had tornadoes.  We had a tornado here that took out 35 homes at one time.  So you're never going to get away necessarily from natural disasters, but you possibly can go to areas where they are less prone to occur in that area.  And I don't think you should base everything you do on that because you're the light of the world and the salt of the earth, Jesus said.  And we need salt and light in these areas that are very negative areas, even in these wicked areas.  If all the believers pull out of an area that's tough or the people are carnal or unbelievers, then there's nothing there to restrain or no one there to at least be, even if it's a small light in the area.  But I will suggest that you be in prayer.  And listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit and follow the burdens that you feel in your heart and pray about them.  But although this is on YouTube, I did post on my Facebook page that if you have had any dream or vision maybe of, a major water disaster on the coast to post it so people can see that if something's going to happen in the future, the Lord can speak to many people about the same thing.  And it's not just one person saying it.  The only reason I shared this with you is I've had so many times where I heard or saw things in the Spirit that happened later after we talked about it.  It happened exactly in detail that I have learned not to keep it to yourself, but to put it out there.  If nothing else, that people will begin to intercede.  Father, we pray that you'll be merciful to us.  We pray that you'll be merciful to us as a nation.  We pray that you will remember your righteous remnant because there is a good remnant of people that love Jesus out there, love his word and are trying to do the right thing.  And when we pray these things, we ask God to remember those who are following you.  Remember those who are trying to do the good.  When Nehemiah was rebuilding the city of Jerusalem in the book of Nehemiah and he was being resisted by everybody around him in samaria um he said every time he did something good he said lord remember me for this.  lord remember me.  i think he said it five times in there in the book of nehemiah that it records in some form or another.  he was asking god to remember him.  so we pray that over you.  we pray that over your families.  now i thank you for allowing the opportunity of uh sharing with you.  we're going to do a lot more youtube videos.  we just have so much we want to share with you.  And the reason, again, we do it is more people go to that than go to the normal Facebook page.  So please stay in touch with us that way.  And if you can all possibly join us in the main event, we'd love to have you.  And I call the main event the International Camp Meeting.  And you go to Perrystone.org to get the information.  And also in about a week, we will have our brand new book, Now It Can Be Told Out, And we're raising funds through the Voice of Evangelism ministry to help us build the dorms for the camp and the school that we're building in the future.  So a lot going on, but I do thank you for your prayers and support.  And also don't forget the Old Testament commentary.  I have never in 44 years done anything in the form of writing that we're getting more positive comments.  I've not got one negative comment out of thousands of comments.  People are saying, we're blown away.  We're learning stuff we never knew.  People are going to the book of Genesis and staying there for two months, just pouring over the commentary.  Thank you for that.  It was seven years of very hard work, but it's finished now.  And thank you for ordering it.  And we hope it'll be a blessing to you.  Thank you for joining me. ",
