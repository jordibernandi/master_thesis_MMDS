I'm your host, Chris James, aka Big C, and as many of you know, I recently discovered that all of the places I thought I had gone, all of the studios I thought I had been in, were actually manifestations of my brain, and I never left my apartment.  I was so excited to finally get out there in the real world, but as soon as I stepped out of my front door, I was immediately taken into custody as I was actually under house arrest.  I don't really want to get into that, and let's just start the damn episode.  This week, we've got calls to JJ McCartney, a radio show for Instagram influencers, plus band pranks Dominic Izzo and the tailgater calls Hawk Owen Carnell.  First, though, we've been trying to get frequent Matt Connerton guest John Hopwood to talk to us for months now to no avail.  But this week we finally made it happen.  That's right.  We tricked him into talking to us.  Oh, and by the way, I've implemented a new rating system.  Red, orange, green.  Red is for bad hosts.  Orange is for not great hosts.  And green is for good hosts.  That way you know if these people are absolute scumbags and whether or not you should hate them.  And it's a great new system and you're going to love it and check it out along with this call. ",

We can definitely help you out.  What's going on, bro?  Is it a dill pickle?  That's funny.  I like that.  So go ahead.  Tell us.  What kind of a pickle are you in?  Okay, so I need to tell you my wife is.  I need you to just tell my wife that I've been with you for the past hour.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  Yep.  Just one second.  She's doing some chores and stuff.  Although I don't believe that that I'm not above the gender stereotypes and stuff.  She just happens to be doing that, but just hang on.  Hello.  Hi, how you doing?  Hi, I was just wondering, my husband says that he's been spending the last hour hanging out with you.  He absolutely has been.  We've been watching some Red Sox games, even though they stink right now.  I mean, we're kind of climbing them off the roof, you know, of depression there because they suck so bad.  What?  Why are you worried?  I mean, he came home.  Okay, so she's gone now.  How did it go?  I think she believed me.  You do not want to know where I actually was.  Maybe we do.  Are you going to tell us?  I'll tell you what.  It rhymes with poor house. ",
