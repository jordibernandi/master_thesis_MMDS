But I've found that for clarity's sake, it's often more effective to show the whole segment and then respond one part at a time, and that's exactly what I'm going to do here.  So, as you've just seen, Craig opens by saying\u2026.  And since he's presenting a first cause argument, you might be tempted, like I was, to assume that he's making a statement about causation, that he's more eloquently saying, everything has a cause.  However, his very next words call this interpretation into question. ",

            "text": "The reason being is subtle, but crucial, and it comes down to the term come into being.  Being literally means existence.  To be is to exist.  And so to say that something has come into being is to say that something has begun to exist, that it's been created.  Hence, unlike the first sentence, which is at least conceivably an assertion about causation, this second sentence is an assertion about creation.  Now to be clear, I'm not accusing Craig of any tricks here, but rather I'm making a subtle but crucial distinction which relates to the aforementioned distractions.  While our intuition would have us believe that creation and classical causation are indisputably linked, quantum mechanics clearly demonstrates that they're not.  In the classical, macroscopic world, we see one domino cause the fall of another domino , but in the quantum realm, this isn't the case.  For example, studies of quantum superposition, which is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, demonstrates that event A can cause event B, event B can cause event A, and on occasion, both A and B can be completely independent.  What's more, we see atoms both excited and not excited at the same time, which calls into question the law of non-contradiction, and we can even see them in two separate positions at the same time.  Add to this quantum entanglement, quantum fluctuations and other such quantum observations, and our beloved classical causation goes completely and utterly out the window.  As Sean Carroll puts it, And yet, despite the quantum realm violating classical causation, it hasn't been shown to violate the law of conservation of energy.  Every atom is accounted for.  Everything, so far as we know, is created from already existing material.  Hence, we have some things, in fact billions of things, coming into being without a classical cause, and perhaps without even a cause at all.  Thus, creation and causation are not two sides of the same coin, and it's a mistake to treat them as such.  This isn't a distraction, it's a refutation. ",

Craig would have you believe that either the universe has a cause or it just popped into existence for no reason whatsoever.  But there's at least one more option, and that brings me to my second point.  we could reject not only the cause claim of the premise, but also the existence claim.  That is, we could claim that the universe never began to exist, it's always existed, in precisely the same way that Craig claims that his God never began to exist, but we can do so without his additional assumptions.  Again, to be clear, I'm not accusing Craig of chicanery here, but rather making a point. ",

Sure, nobody sincerely believes that macroscopic things can just pop into existence without a cause, and for good reason.  Our empirical observations and, more importantly, our objective verifiable evidence clearly shows that when macroscopic things begin to exist, they do so via causation.  However, and this was Scott's excellent point, the exact same objective verifiable evidence equally shows that all new macroscopic things are comprised of material that already existed.  Hence, Craig and his ilk are cherry-picking to the extreme.  They're confidently asserting that macroscopic things are caused in the classical sense, and yet they're rejecting that all new macroscopic things are merely the rearrangement of already existing material.  They're having their cake and binning it too.  Anyhow, springboarding from this claim, Craig goes on to state the following\u2026. ",

To wrap up, I'd like to pour us all a huge glass of humble juice.  That sounded better on paper.  I want to emphasise that if the discoveries of the 20th century has taught us anything at all, it's how little we know, and it cautions us not to be so sure of ourselves.  There is a reason why Newton's laws were called laws, and yet Einstein's theories called theories.  Compared to our ancestors, we are not so sure of ourselves, and that is a good thing.  That is humility.  Now, theists don't typically like to admit this, because doing so jeopardises their entire worldview, but the vast majority of physicists, who are, after all, the people who most understand these things, admit with full humility that we don't have all the answers, we don't know if the grand universe is eternal or if it had a beginning.  But if you want to hear people confidently claim that we do know the answers, then look no further than the religious, for they start with their conclusion and work backwards.  In this regard, they are the antithesis of science and an affront to honest, humble investigation.  Case in point, be cautious of those who say they know, especially when they're trespassing upon fields in which they have no expertise. ",
