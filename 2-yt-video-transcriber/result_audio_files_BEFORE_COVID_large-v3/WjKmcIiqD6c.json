            "text": "All right, here's another question.  This is a totally different question.  It won't be as much fun.  I wanted to know what you have to say about Seventh-day Adventists.  They make a good vegetable dish.  Because I stayed with some Seventh-day Adventists for a whole week and preached in several churches and ate with them, and they were very nice people.  Very nice people.  I enjoyed it.  My 20-year-old daughter is dating one.  That sounds freaky, doesn't it?  That sounds scary.  And I have tried to research and have found that some say they are a cult.  One man's cult is another's faith.  Sometimes it's hard to define what a cult is.  Is this true?  And if so, what should we, her parents, do?  Sherry is the one who asked this question.  So I'm going to have to talk about the Seventh-day Adventists.  I don't want to have to do that.  I got some good friends that are Seventh-day Adventists, as you say, down south.  And so I don't want to say anything bad about them.  But I do, when the opportunity comes, point out to them the era of their church.  So understand what I'm saying is not against the seven-day Adventist people.  It's Ellen White that messed up and the religion she created for a bunch of Baptists, by the way.  And she's the one that's the false prophet.  She's the one who spent her time better if she'd been home making biscuits and gravy rather than out trying to prophesy.  I intended to say that.  I know that's sexist, but I like the way it sounds.  All right.  Now, Sherry looked up what the Seventh-day Adventists believe, and here's what she sent me.  They teach that to be baptized in their church, one must confess to three things.  Number one, do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and Lord?  I am confident many of the Seventh-day Adventists are saved.  Maybe about as many as the Baptists are saved.  I don't know.  Hard to say.  But I've heard them preach the gospel of Jesus Christ clearly and plainly.  Secondly, they, they teach, do you, they ask, this is what they require when you're baptized.  Do you accept the teachings of the Bible as expressed in the statement of fundamental beliefs of the seventh day Adventist church?  And do you pledge to live your life in harmony with these teachings?  And that's going a little too far.  I don't like anybody asked me to make pledges, especially with something, but an organization or a system or some man-made written up doctrines, not going to do that.  The 28 fundamentals, she says, include Sabbath keeping and belief in the divine inspiration of Ellen White's writings.  Now, by the way, I've read Ellen White's writings.  Not all of them, but I've read her big history book and her Shelter in the Storm and two or three others.  I mean, I said I read them, analyzed them.  So they teach that to be a Seventh-day Adventist, to be baptized, you've got to worker to confidence in the divine inspiration of Ellen White writings And the investigative judgment that supposedly occurred in 1844.  Now, what is that?  A guy named William Miller, a Baptist, had a vision that in Christ was coming back a couple of years later in 1844.  So he began to preach that to a bunch of people, got a big crowd up and they all got ready, sold their belongings, got up on the mountaintop and housetop, wherever, and waited.  The time came the day, nothing happened, no coming.  So they changed it, we got the date off, it was a couple years later and they waited and still didn't happen.  So being the gentleman that he was, William Miller retired from his prophetic school and gave it up, quit.  There'd be a lot of teachers, preachers and television need to do that.  But then one of his followers, Alan White, very smart woman, very brilliant, very capable, picked it up and ran with it.  She had a vision, she had an understanding that actually the second coming did occur in 1844, but it was for investigative judgments, whatever that is.  And no one saw it and no one left the earth.  It was a different interpretation as to what the prophecy was actually about.  And then the final thing, the third, accept the fellowship Uh, of the seven day Adventist church.  Okay.  Then she said the events of 1844 that you're supposed to believe.  Jesus entered into the second compartment of the heavenly sanctuary for the first time in October 22nd, 1844 and began an investigative judgment.  This judgment is the fulfillment of the second phase of Christ atoning work that they place their assurance of salvation in both imputed and imparted righteousness.  So this is why she's concerned that her daughter is dating a Seventh-day Adventist.  Now, let me tell you what else the Seventh-day Adventist is supposed to believe.  Now, if you were to take them what they believed in 1852 and what the average Seventh-day Adventist believed today, there's been an evolution toward truth.  That's certainly true.  There's been, they've dropped many of the things they haven't officially denied them, you know, like Ellen White was wrong, but they don't mention it.  They don't teach it.  They'd be a bit embarrassed about it.  So I think there's been any evangelical movement of the seven Adventists over the last 150 years.  So they teach that Satan is going to reign 1000 years on the earth.  Not Jesus Christ.  John got it all wrong.  When he said Christ was going to reign, it's actually Satan.  And the bottomless pit is actually the earth.  When they're cast in the bottomless pit, they're actually cast down to the earth.  John got that wrong too.  Jesus Christ's death did not cover the moral commandments written on Moses' tablets.  So when Jesus died, he didn't die to pay for our disobedience to the Ten Commandments.  It only covered the ceremonial laws that God gave to Israel.  The white throne judgment began nearly a century ago.  That's an 1844 be longer than a century now.  Uh, and the dead a century ago and the dead small and great now being judged there, it was just being done where nobody could see it.  And then Satan bore my sins, not Jesus Christ is what they originally taught.  because he was the scapegoat, as in the Old Testament.  Jesus Christ was not the scapegoat.  According to them, Satan was.  And then here's the one that they hang to to this day, and that is that the mark of the beast in the book of Revelation is keeping worshiping on Sunday.  That's the mark of the beast.  that anyone who worships on Sunday and not Saturday is stamped in their forehead, their frontal lobe, not really, you know, like a mark, but in their brain is infected with the Sunday keeping.  they got from Constantine.  And so they have the mark of the beast on them when they go to church on Sunday.  That's weird.  But that they cling to and preach to this day.  Now that's not all.  It gets even worse.  The Adventist church considers Ellen White's writings to be inspired commentary on the Bible, not of human origin.  And it is unquestionable.  No Seventh-day Adventist can question anything Ellen White said.  That's like questioning what Jesus said.  You don't do that.  It's written down.  It was inspired, inspired commentary, and you have to believe it and to be baptized in the church.  You have to consent ahead of time that you believe all of her writings to be the inspired words of God to you.  And then they call her writings, the spirit of prophecy, and they claim her predictions were directly revealed to her from God.  She claims that that her predictions were directly revealed to her from God.  Now, in Deuteronomy 18, it says we're to try and test the prophets.  Said if a prophet makes a prediction out of many, many predictions, and one of them does not come true, he should be stoned to death.  Now, I'm thankful we're not under that in.  the Seventh-day Adventists say that part passed away, just not the Ten Commandments.  They're not going to understand why they'd be for it passing away.  So I'm glad we don't live under the Old Testament, that we live under the Testament of Christ, not the old one any longer.  But a prophet that made a false prediction would be stoned to death.  Now, Ellen White's not the only false prophet.  There's a great preacher, a great minister of the Word of God who'll get more rewards in heaven than I will, Dave Wilkerson.  I went up to New York in 1965 to see his work, beautiful work he was doing.  But several years later he wrote a book with 10 prophecies in it.  And I made a note in my mind, which doesn't carry a lot of stuff, but I made a note in my mind of one of them where he said the Catholic Church would begin to persecute anybody who spoke in tongues.  That has not happened.  The Catholic Church has fully adopted tongues and many, many Roman Catholics speak in tongues and it's very popular in the Catholic Church.  So Dave Wilkerson was a false prophet.  Poor fellow had to have been stoned to death if he lived back during that period of time.  It's a shame, but a lot of great preachers, great men of God, get the big head when God used them for other things, and they get to thinking they're prophets, and they start making predictions.  And you see it all the time on TV.  You see somebody doing that, don't give them a dime's worth of attention, much less a dime.  Now, here are seven prophecies that Ellen White made.  So we're going to see if she's a prophet.  Because these are in the past.  They either have or have not been fulfilled.  Number one, she said, and this was way back in the 1850s, old Jerusalem would never be built up.  It was done.  God was through with the Jews.  There would be no reconstruction of Jerusalem.  She missed that one, didn't she?  It was the church of Christ put out a book in 1948 saying that there could be no revival.  And God was through the Jews by approved by the fact that there would never be a rebuilt Jerusalem.  It wasn't even a year.  And Jerusalem is back in the hands of the Jews.  And they were a nation once again in the land where they hadn't been for 2000 years.  Second prophecy she made during, uh, during the, um, um, civil war.  She said England would attack the United States during the Civil War.  Did that happen?  Not in my history book.  Ellen White was a liar.  She's a false prophet.  She said the Civil War was a sign that Jesus was about to return, that he'd return.  In fact, he'd return in a few months.  That's in a book called Early Writings, and it's on page 67 for your perusal.  And then she said that the Adventist living in 1856, she said this clearly would live to see the second coming of Christ.  That some of them would, some of them would be, uh, some, a few of them would die, but a large number of them would live to see this.  There's not a seven day Adventist that was alive in the 1850s.  That's still alive today.  Uh, you can't live that long, not eating meat.  And then the sixth one was Christ would return before slavery was abolished.  Christ would return before and he would liberate the slaves, the southern slaves held down south.  That's what she taught.  And then finally, poor Joseph Smith, he got it wrong on this too.  She saw Enoch in a vision on Jupiter or maybe it was Saturn.  A place that was more lovely than the earth, full of beautiful plants, birds, all kinds of creatures.  A beautiful place.  There's Enoch up there on Saturn.  Well, you know, back then you could risk making a prophecy like that.  Who's ever going to go to Saturn, right?  I mean, like Joseph Smith, he said there was on the backside of the moon, Joseph Smith, the Mormons, there was a race of people.  He even said at the North Pole, there was a nipple there where the environment was perfect and beautiful and people lived up there.  But now, back there in 1840s, when Joseph Smith was predicting, no one could go to the North Pole.  Wasn't too long, they started giving it a try.  Finally made it, but not in his time.  And then, so, the idea we'd ever get to the moon or Saturn and prove them wrong was preposterous at that time.  All right.  I want to say again, I don't have any animosity toward the Seventh-day Adventists, and I don't enjoy doing that, at least not very much, knowing that it makes some Seventh-day Adventists that are good people uncomfortable.  But I do have an exhortation to you.  Leave the Seventh-day Adventist church.  It was founded on corrupt causes.  Now, if you want to, I don't know, just leave it.  It's a corrupted institution.  It doesn't mean you're not a Christian.  I'm not like you.  I don't think because you worship on Saturday, you're out of fellowship with God.  Saturday's a fine day to worship on.  You want to do it?  Great.  No problem at all.  Tuesday's a good day, too.  Or like the Muslims on Friday, that's a good day.  Pick any day you want.  Pick every day.  That's what I do.  All right?  That's all, folks. ",
