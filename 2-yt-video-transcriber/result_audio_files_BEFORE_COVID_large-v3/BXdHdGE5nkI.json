            "text": "Now I get booked into jail.  I do my fingerprints.  They ran my fingerprints like three times to see if.  somehow if the fingerprints match up, it didn't.  So the correctional officers was like, hey, just look at the jail tour and try to make sense of humor out of it.  And I didn't think it was funny because I never got in trouble.  And why am I sitting in jail now?  So I'm gonna have you come right over here, all right?  It'll just take a couple of minutes.  I switched back over.  And just stay on your life.  You're not under arrest.  I just need to make sure that you don't have any forms, okay?  That's why I came over because I heard her on the radio.  Tell me, are you here for somebody?  Yeah.  Where are they?  Get his phone and make sure you call his friend.  I don't want to know his name.  Okay.  Someone stole your identity?  Is that what happened?  Ask me!  I gotta be honest, I believed you until I matched your tattoos and your scars.  Absolutely.  And your date of birth.  I want to believe him, but they know too much.  Everything matched, except the height.  The height said 5'7\".  Right, but it also sent scars on both knees.  And a discolorated scar on the left arm.  We were given a warning for the glasses.  And then it expired.  Is there registration for your bike?  I don't have the paper.  No, it shows it's expired.  I've been doing it for months like that.  It's more than nice to you.  Everything coming out of your mouth seems like one lie after another.  And I'm trying.  He's lying.  He's lying.  I didn't have my sunglasses on.  And the officer, it was two rookie officers, they pulled me over and they gave me a warning for not having my sunglasses on.  And then the sergeant of the two officers came over and she said I had a warrant out for my arrest.  She put me in handcuffs, first of all.  She put me in handcuffs and said, turn around.  You're not arrested, but you're being detained.  And so she came back and she said I had a warrant out for my arrest.  So I showed her more information on telling her that I didn't have a one-up from her so I don't have a record.  She came back and she said that my tattoos match up and I told her that my tattoos can't match up with anybody else because they're my kid's name.  so I know people out there don't have the same tattoos I have.  And she was like, everything else matches but my height.  So that's a red flag right there.  If somebody's 5'7 and I'm 6'2, there's no way I can tell a cop that I'm 5'7 and you can look at me and figure out that I'm over six foot.  That doesn't add up.  And I told her that.  I'm like, that doesn't make sense.  You even said it yourself.  How are you going to say that it's me?  And she said, oh, well, you're lying, you're lying.  I kept debating back and forth with her.  So it was like a pointless conversation because she was adamant that it was me.  So now I get booked into jail.  I do my fingerprints.  They ran my fingerprints like three times to see if somehow, if the fingerprints match up, it didn't.  So the corrections officers was like, hey, just look at the jail tour.  I'm trying to make sense of humor out of it.  And I didn't think it was funny because I never got in trouble.  And why am I sitting in jail now?  And I'm basically getting treated like a criminal when I don't have that kind of lifestyle.  Um, it was, it was, it was the nervous and it was scared because I never been in handcuffs.  Like I don't have no record.  So like I worked hard to make sure I don't get in jail and don't live that lifestyle, that path.  So it was pretty scary.  It was nerve wracking. ",
