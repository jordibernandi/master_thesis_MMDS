And he recently did a video about dating.  Kind of dating.  And for context, there was a New York Post, I believe it was, article that was all about how successful career women are kind of lamenting in their 30s having a hard time finding men who are as successful as they are.  in terms of career, in terms of finances.  And so Tim did a response about that.  And his whole thing was kind of like, yeah, there are actually successful men out there.  Like ladies, it's not that these men don't exist, it's that maybe, and at least it was the case for him, they're not interested in dating you specifically.  And he was very respectful toward career women saying like, if you want to become a CEO as well, like it's your choice, be free to do it.  That's awesome, whatever you want, but just don't expect all men to want to be in a relationship with you if you work all of these long hours.  And he shared some personal anecdotes.  I kind of left that video saying, okay, like completely reasonable.  I wasn't bothered by it at all.  We have a clip of it here that you guys can check out.  Maybe you'll see something offensive that I didn't. ",

So that means a partnership would involve someone who could fill in the gap on the other side.  The problem I'm having as an economically attractive male, I suppose, someone with a job and a career and success, is that I can't find women who want to be in families.  And I mean that.  Look, you're going to find a lot of dudes who are struggling in the economy.  That's bad.  We got to figure out that problem.  But apparently, it's not a problem that women don't want to be in families.  Now, don't get me wrong.  A lot of women want to have it all.  That's what they say.  They say, have it all, right?  That's the joke.  You know, 30 Rock did a great bit about Tina Fey, you know, Liz Lemon wanting to have it all.  Go for it.  I got no problem.  The problem is I'm not looking for, you know, half.

Just a reminder that this is the internet and people will be upset with anything that you say.  So there's this one woman in particular.  We have her tweet.  Robin Panikia?  that's something i think italian.  um she says i don't know who she is but she's verified on twitter.  i don't know what that means but she says in response to a clip of tim's video this is truly the most cringe inducing thing i have ever seen in all my life tim pool talking about how ladies need to realize that economically attractive which by the way was the article's term not tim's term and it's something that people do say in the dating like i. I don't know why.  she made a big deal out about that, realized that economically attractive men like him only want housewives and mothers, not career women.  So she obviously took this very, very personally.  And I just want to say that there are studies to back this up.  This is not something that Tim has just kind of imagined himself and i don't know to me.  there's not really any criticism in this tweet.  it's just kind of like i'm mad about this.  yeah right she's not really refuting him it's just i'm mad right and it's like darn gravity.  yeah you know like.  oh no to say to this.  and i i think it is important to kind of re-emphasize that this whole video that tim does it wasn't just him out of the blue trashing career women.  that's not what happened.  he was responding to an article that specifically was talking about the preferences that career women have Right?  So this is like, obviously we're fine as a society realizing that, okay, if you're a career woman and you have all this money, you may not want to date a man who's like, I guess, less financially stable than you are, which is fine.  You can have your own preferences, but it's only when Tim weighs in with his preferences that... That's what the tweet sounded like, by the way, in my mind when I read it, just screeching.  All right.  So apparently a lot of other people agreed with this.  Robin, though, because in this thread, there are a lot of people weighing in and saying, yes, screw Tim.  Heidi Moore, another checkmark, says, suggested U.S.  employment program.  Tell women that if they don't get jobs, Tim Pool will try to date them.  the unemployment rate among women would plummet.  Again, there's no refutation of what Tim has said here, which is like he's describing his own personal preferences, which I'm sorry, you can't get mad at someone's personal preferences.  And him also saying that statistically, this is what a lot of men do want.  Like you can say it shouldn't be like this, which is a conversation we can have, but just being mad in response to reality, Oh, she's having a hissy fit there, Heidi. ",

He just says he doesn't want someone who works 16 hours a day like him, because then when would they hang out?  And he actually drew on an example of when that happened in a relationship with another woman.  And they just never had time to hang out, which is a real problem.  that happens.  Saying that a man wanting a woman who can dedicate more time to the home life is just them wanting someone who cooks, cleans, and has babies is like saying that wanting a man who's financially stable is just wanting a sugar daddy.

It's really weird how little respect they seem to give to women who, it is still work, work all day, cleaning, cooking, raising kids.  It's very strange to me.  Like, ultimately, what you want in a partner, that is your call.  It's not for anyone else to say that that's not right.  I mean, if they care about you, maybe they might say, hey, just maybe make sure you think about this.  I want what's best for you.  But that's not what these women are doing.  They're not worried about, like, what would be best for Tim in his life.  Clearly, they're just upset that someone doesn't want to date them.  And I think they're so upset because a lot of women who are maybe in their 30s now have great jobs, which is amazing for them, they grew up with the notion that you can have it all.  That you can just, you know, be super successful and that a man will want you just for your success and he doesn't have any desires or aspirations or preferences of his own.  He'll just conform to you. ",

It's like they don't go after economically well-off 30-year-olds.  That's not what they're looking for.  It's just a almost law of social nature.  So \u2013 Yeah, I don't know what they're angry at.

If there are two people who are just super successful in their own careers, but no one's at home to take care of any potential kids, it's just two people being alone with all their money.  I don't know, to me, I completely understand Tim's reasoning.  Like, he has money of his own.  What he lacks is someone who has more of the time to commit to maybe raising kids or helping and stuff like that.  And it's just, yeah, I mean, Tim's made response videos about this, clarifying his own position more, so I don't need to speak for him.  The quartering, Jeremy's made a video about this.  That's right.  I am still confused as to why this is at all controversial.  I'm still waiting.  Maybe eventually someone will explain it to me. ",
