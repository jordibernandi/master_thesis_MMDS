            "text": "Hey everybody out there interested in revealing truth and exposing errors in the time we live in.  We know that over the past decade the ecumenical movement has been progressing at an exponential rate and it would appear that Francis Chan is helping out more and more with this movement, so that's what we'll cover today.  Pulpit and Pen just did an article that I'm going to read here because it's short and to the point.  But first, if you don't know what the ecumenical movement is, it's based on the principle or aim of promoting unity among the world's religions.  While unity is good in many senses, it does not include the unity of saying that all religions worship the same God.  In my video, The Coming One World Religion, I go into much more detail.  And even with my video, Ecumenical Warning, Passion 2020, I got many negative comments from people that are deceived and think it's okay to attend Christian events that have speakers that support this movement.  They say, we don't listen to the speakers, we're just there to worship Jesus.  And while that sounds good, let me ask you this.  Would you go to a Mormon church and say, I'm just there to worship, but don't listen to the speakers?  No, of course not.  And it's no different with an event like the Send or Passion with false teachers speaking.  With that being said, Pulpit and Pen starts off by asking the question, is Francis Chan becoming Roman Catholic?  his recently espoused views on transubstantiation certainly has roman catholics excited it goes on to say.  as reformation charlotte reported it appears that chan is now embracing roman catholic doctrine on a deeper level than most previously would have expected.  Chan, who has once referred to himself as a Calvinist, several years ago rebuked an apologist who spoke at his church against the errors of Roman Catholicism.  Now, Chan appears to be embracing one of the most horrific and idolatrous doctrines of the Roman Catholic Mass, transubstantiation.  It continues saying a Catholic priest is giddy with excitement over Chan's apparent move, and I'm going to include the video in this just a moment.  Again, as Reformation Charlotte reports, in the video you can hear Chan beginning to embrace this and acting as though this is a historical and biblical practice of the Church.  In the video, he blames the error of viewing communion as symbolic on the Protestant Reformation, stating that it wasn't until 500 years ago that someone popularized the thought that it's, meaning communion, just a symbol and nothing more.  So as the days get darker, more are being deceived, and we must be on alert to warn others out there what's going on.  But without further ado, here's the video. ",

You guys, I've been dreaming about this.  I've been praying about this going, man, I would love it if one day in our country, here in the  U.S.,  people understood the body of Christ, that they were just a part of it, and they got excited to gather and partake of the body and blood of Christ.

We're all dreaming to be so united to Jesus Christ that his blood becomes one with ours, our body with his, our souls intermingled, and his divinity entering our very presence.  And that's Holy Communion.  He was real flesh and blood.  And that's what he's going on in this preaching.  I listened to the entire 48 minutes of this gospel message that Francis preached.  I'm going to leave it right here.  Take a listen.  He talks about the fact that worship is this mystical heavenly thing happening that we become part of.  And we're one brick in this mystical body.  And Paul is there.  And he says the Virgin Mary is there.  All this Catholic language.  And so this message.  evangelical preacher is having a conversion.  Right now, I'm convinced of the Catholic Church.  And so everybody, pray now that he has his full conversion because this is a beautiful, epic moment for the church and for the truth of Jesus Christ, the fullness of his truth.  And Francis, if you're listening right now, man, give me a call.  I want to talk about this because this is where my heart lives.  My heart lives in the mystical body of Jesus Christ and recognizing that the church says that the source and summit of our faith, must be the Eucharist.  And this is what we're all dying for.  And this is what the church has been dying for.  This is what martyrs died for for 2,000 years.  The belief that in this host is not bread and wine, but the true presence of Jesus Christ.  So Francis, I'm praying for you.  Everyone watching is praying for you.  And man, give me a call because we want you in the fullness of this church.  Come home. ",
