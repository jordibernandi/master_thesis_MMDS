            "text": "alright here we are with another question.  I am Michael Pearl.  you are at the door.  and is the United States in prophecy?  are the coming invasion of Israel?  you know what a lot of people make a mistake.  we're ethnocentric.  we we live in America with the greatest people in all the world.  SO SURELY THE BIBLE PROPHECY IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT US, RIGHT?  NO.  I MEAN, WE'RE COMING LATELY AT THE END OF A MILLENNIUM.  THE WHOLE FIRST MILLENNIUM WE WEREN'T EVEN HERE.  MOST OF THE NEXT MILLENNIUM WE WEREN'T EVEN HERE.  WE COME AT THE END OF THE SECOND MILLENNIUM AND WE WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF BIBLE PROPHECY?  WE LIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN FROM ISRAEL?  NO.  SEE, ALL THE BIBLE PROPHECIES ARE ABOUT ISRAEL.  THEY'RE NOT ABOUT US.  now where they are about other nations it's because those other nations affect Israel somewhat.  now there is one prophecy that can include the United States and we're gonna look at that now.  I wrote a whole book on the subject the prophecy of Magog and Israel Ezekiel 38 in 39.  I haven't even looked at this book since it was printed.  I was shocked when I want to get a copy today.  it's a good.  it's good book.  i i read it.  see what i can learn.  it's got all kinds of pictures in it that are pretty.  i didn't even know they were in there well laid out.  so in fact i forgot.  i wrote the book but uh I'm gonna get a copy rated your did.  what I did do is I went back to the book over book music.  you'll 38 and 39 today and I've got the whole two chapters not gonna go labor all over written out here and this tells up the coming invasion of Israel.  know why not?  I'm talking about this is prophecies are being fulfilled right now today that gonna lead to this.  things are happening in the Duke news right now over there in the Middle East that you can see now.  I'm not saying that without doubt what's happening is going to lead immediately to these events here.  I'm saying that if these events were going to take place two years from now then conditions are right right now for them to take place.  conditions are now as they would need to be for this prophecy to be fulfilled.  those conditions were not right fifteen years ago thirty years ago a hundred years ago thousand years ago.  the conditions are right today.  something has happened in our day and age that is leading to the fulfillment of his equal thirty eight and thirty nine.  Here's the prophecy.  I've got extreme detail in this little book.  I won't have time to go into that by any means.  So he says, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshach and Tubal.  I prove who thou art.  who those people are it's it's you go back in the Bible.  you take the names of those personalities.  you look at when they were born you look at where they moved to.  you look at the children and you see the family tree.  and we're reading the family tree here.  and we have historically the location of those people where they live and where they travel.  and this Gog and Magog are Japheth these sons of Japheth Shem Ham and Japheth.  they include the Russians as well as many of the other Aryan peoples of Eastern Europe.  So Gog and Magog is not just the nation of Russia, but it is the general white race of people that exist in Europe there.  Say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshach and Tubal.  And that's, they used to say it's Moscow and Tobolsk.  It's not.  It just happens to rhyme with them.  those cities didn't exist at that time.  I will turn the back and put hooks into that jaws this invading force in Israel.  I'll bring the fourth hour with not that army horse and horsemen all of them clothed with sorts of armor even a great company with buckers and shields all them handling swords.  now this seems to be strange.  you can talk about them coming on horseback with swords and shields.  i say that thirty years ago that was not likely.  it is more likely today.  i have uh... pictures of the second world war uh... being fought on horseback.  the polish armies defended against the invading russians with great numbers rushing across the plains on horseback.  my daddy was in the second world war.  he joined the military and was trained on horseback.  now he didn't end up fighting horseback but he was trained in anticipation of horseback back during uh... uh... afghanistan.  uh... the mules price was really high intensity because we're shipping from all for our military to use in afghanistan.  russia is creating of the largest population horses and mules in the world you said.  why is it more more likely to happen today than back then?  because we now have the ability to nullify all electronic equipment.  What happens when EMPs are set off?  You know, even the modern rifles are being set up to work off computers, even the projectiles.  And with the interweaving of communications, when all that stuff goes down, no rockets or airplanes will fly, no tanks, no trucks.  uh... no radios.  uh... give me a sort of gift that give me a shield then.  and uh... horseback down horseback of superior.  get there quicker and uh... get away quicker.  that's what i want to get away from this battle.  and he says uh... i will turn the back with your horses.  nine names four five countries five countries are going to invade israel.  the interesting thing at the time that this was written seven hundred years bc twenty seven hundred years ago at the time this was written there was a hundred different countries that were potential threat to israel and he just happens to name four of these better existed today.  that didn't cease to exist.  and the fifth one is not really a country to people group.  in that people group still exist.  Those countries are forming up right now together under Gog and Magog To fulfill this prophecy.  the first one he names is going to invade Israel with Gog and Magog is Persia.  The English changed the name of Persia to Iran and Iraq and But it was Persia, Persian rugs, Persian carpets, Persian lamps, Persian vases.  And there's discussion of changing it back.  I suspect they will.  So Persia is going to be part of invading force.  Ethiopia, which is also aligned with Russia.  Libya, aligned with Russia.  with them all of them with shield and helmet gomer.  now gomer are the sons of japheth.  they're gauls brits.  it's a white aryan race.  france belgium switzerland southern germany austria and the czech republic along with the united states of america new zealand and australia are all gomer.  So this Gomer is going to be part of the invading force with these others.  He's separating them because some of them are Muslim groups, some of them are African, and then some of them are international.  And then he says the house of Togomar is the next one.  That's Turkey.  now the turkish language is spoken by one hundred and seventy million.  is miss different forms of it but it's turk.  turkistan is spoken by one hundred and seventy million people.  now the countries like uh... kazakhstan turkmenistan use becca stan as a bad john.  they're all have turkish derive languages and descend from the turkish lineage.  And so that group of people are going to be part, and all of them are Muslim, part of the invading force of Israel, as well as Ethiopia, Persia, and Libya.  They're all Muslim.  Be thou prepared and prepare thyself.  No, excuse me.  NORTH QUARTERS AND ALL HIS BANDS AND MANY PEOPLE WITH THEE.  SO THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, LOTS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE MIXED IN WITH THIS INVADING FORCE.  BE THOU PREPARED, PREPARE FOR THYSELF, THOU AND ALL THY COMPANY.  THAT BE ASSEMBLED UNTO THEE, BE THOU A GUARD UNTO THEM.  HERE'S THE PROPHECY.  AFTER MANY DAYS, SPEAKING TO ISRAEL, THOU SHALL BE VISITED.  IN THE LATTER YEARS, TERM USED FOR THE END OF OUR AGE.  Thou shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword.  He's talking about the Jews coming home in 1947 and 48 to the land of Palestine and is gathered out of many people.  many different nations yielded up the Jews to go back there against the mountains of Israel which have been always waste.  they were totally wasted for two thousand years which is brought back out of the nation's the nations United Nations.  that's how Israel came to exist.  United Nations declared a homeland for the Jews Brought out of the nations that they shall dwell safely.  Israel dwell safely all of them.  So that's the prophecy of Israel at that time.  thou shalt ascend and come like a storm.  He's speaking to these foreign countries.  thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land.  Thus saith the Lord Sheba and Dedan that's Saudi Arabia area and the merchants of Tarshish that's Spain with all the young lions, that's the descendants of the Spanish, and of the Sheba and Dedan, shall say unto thee, art thou come to take us forth?  So they're not going to be involved in the invading force.  Spain, the Spanish, the Mexicans, South Americans won't be involved in it.  Nor will Saudi Arabia be involved, or Yemen, that's Dedan, be involved in this invading force.  They will say, Are you come to take a spoil?  Just a question.  Hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey, to take a spoil?  Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord God in that day, When my people of Israel dwell safely, shalt thou not know it?  Thou shalt come out of the north parts, many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, a mighty army.  Thou shalt come up against the people of Israel as a cloud to cover the land.  In the latter days it will happen, he said.  thus saith the Lord it shall come to pass in that time when God shall come against the land of Israel.  saith the Lord God my fury shall come upon my face and he said there'd be a great shaking in the mountains.  verse 20 it describes the tribulation.  a great sword upon the land hailstones fire brimstone coming out of the sky.  tribulation.  thus will a magnify myself and sanctify myself.  I'll be known as the many nations.  therefore son of man prophesied against Gog and say thus saith the Lord behold I'm against the old God the chief prince of Meshach and Tubal.  I will turn the back and leave the six part of the so 5 6 up.  the invading force is going to be killed.  I'm skipping.  a lot of passenger are going to be killed in the mountains north to Jerusalem.  he said I will cause the to come up from the north parts.  I'll bring me up on the mountains.  a visual.  so the northern part of Israel southern Lebanon is where the Russia and the United States and Britain and Switzerland and Germany and Turkey and Ethiopia and Persia and Libya they're all going to be destroyed on the mountains north of Jerusalem.  he described that destruction.  he said I'll send a fire on Magog so back home and among all that dwell carelessly in the aisles.  so those places like the United States Great Britain Australia those that do a carelessly be a fire among them to do a carelessly and they shall know that I am the Lord and that they that dwell in the cities Israel shall go forth.  Now here's interesting.  And set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields, the bucklers, the bows, the arrows, the hand staves, the spears, they shall burn them with fire seven years.  So they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down out of the forest, for they shall burn the weapons of fire, and they shall spoil those that spoil them, and rob those that rob them.  It shall come to pass in that day, I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the  sea.\".  It shall stop the noses of the passengers, and they shall bury Gog and the multitude, and they shall call it the Valley of Hamagog.  Seven months shall the house of Israel be bearing of them, that they may cleanse the land, and all the people of the land shall bury them, and it shall be to them a renown in that day, and I shall be glorified, saith the Lord.  So this is going to be such a thorough destruction, a burning of fire on the mountains north of Jerusalem that it will take everybody in your Israel seven months to cleanse the land he calls it.  but then he said they will sever out men of continual employment and as they pass through the land they'll set a flag up on men's bones and then they'll come back and bury the dead in order to cleanse the land.  and that'll take seven years.  First of all, there's an intense intense cleansing bearing process of everyone taking part for seven months.  Then there's a job description.  a piece in the Jerusalem Post says Wanted hiring right now Men to pass through the land of Israel searching for the polluted bones of the dead Americans and Germans Russians and Frenchmen whose bones lie in our sacred land.  and for seven years men will travel through the land set a flag up so that they can see it and come and dig up what's there and dispose of it now.  that's a prophecy that is a Bible prophecy that will come true.  and I say to you right now if Turkey has gotten together with Syria and gotten together with Persia they're there together in Syria and Russia is in there arming them.  Russia right now selling anti missiles that will take out the Israeli airplanes or American airplanes to Turkey.  and of the things are coming together.  the alignment of the nations are such that if the rapture were to take place tonight.  I can see invasion of Israel taking place right away.  so this is Bible prophecy to cleanse the land a lot more.  HE SAYS THESE PEOPLE, ISRAEL, WILL BE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE GRAVES, GATHERED OUT OF ALL THE NATIONS, COME FROM MANY NATIONS.  I'LL GATHER THEM INTO THEIR OWN LAND.  AND BRING THEM BACK AND REALLY SOME DETAILED PROPHECIES THERE ABOUT ISRAEL.  WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO ALL OF IT.  IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE IN THIS LITTLE BOOK.  THE PROPHECY OF MAGOG AND ISRAEL, EZEKIEL 38 AND 39 OR THE SUBTITLE IS THE UNITED STATES IN PROPHECY.  AND THIS BOOK IS BY MICHAEL PEARL.  YOU CAN GET IT IN.  NO GREATER JOY MINISTRIES.  SO THAT'S THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.  IS THE UNITED STATES IN PROPHECY?  I think so, under Gog and Magog.  All right, that's all. ",
