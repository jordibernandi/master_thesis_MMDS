            "text": "Come over here sister.  Come talk to me sister.  What's your name sister?  You can come closer because you speak a little too low.  Delaina.  What do you know about the Bible?  Do you know anything?  What do you know about it?  Do you know about the people in the Bible who God is dealing with, the color, what Christ looked like?  What do you know?  Then let me teach you.  Give me Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 4.  When you're reading the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, God is only talking to one people.  He's only dealing with one people.  He only loves one people.  If you know God does so much about one people, what do you want to know?  who they are?  He's split the Red Sea for these people.  Give me Jeremiah 17, verse 4.  But there's a problem with those people.  They don't know who they are in 2019.  They call themselves Haitian, Zom, Yardi, Badman, Jamaican, Barbadian, Puerto Rican, Mexican, Peru.  That's what they take these names now.  They don't know how special they are.  Give me Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 4.  The book of Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 4, right?  And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage.  God said you would discontinue.  The so-called Puerto Ricans of Boricua, Italian descent, they would discontinue from their heritage.  They would not know who they are in these last days.  They would not know how special they are to God.  Because society teaches that what?  The Puerto Ricans and Haitians are two different people, right?  You speak Spanish, got curly long hair?  I got nappy, I'm dark skinned, I speak Creole, and I love my plankton, right?  We're two different people.  But according to the Bible, we're the same people.  That's why we pack the prison cells.  That's why we get gunned down the streets.  That's why when Haiti got hit with the hurricane, they didn't come help us.  Just like they didn't come help the Puerto Ricans in the islands.  America actually banned other countries from helping y'all, man.  They can help y'all.  But we're the same people, man.  We're in the same boat.  Jeremiah chapter 15, verse 33.  Jeremiah chapter 50 verse 33.  The Bible said we will go through the same oppressions, man.  We got to wake up and keep God's commandments.  We're special in His eyes.  And we got to be it, man.  If I were to ask you, who are the best people in sports?  What people dominate sports?  Blacks and Hispanics, right?  Baseball, soccer, basketball, football.  What people dominate in music?  It's us, right?  Beauty.  All the women on earth is trying to mimic you.  They want curves like you, lips like you, skin, nose like you, right?  That's why they make butt injections, breast implants, because they're trying to mimic you.  Jeremiah chapter 50 verse 33.  Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the children of Israel, the children of Israel who is the so-called Hispanics of Native Indian descent, read, and the children of Judah, the so-called Negroes of America, Jamaicans, Haitians, read, were oppressed.  Were what?  Were oppressed.  Were what?  Were oppressed.  Americans gunned down their streets, thrown in their prison cells, mistreated, no justice, no peace in America.  God said we would be going through the same thing in America, man.  It's high time for our people to gather together and keep his commandments.  Give me Deuteronomy chapter 28, first one.  I want to see if you can relate to this.  If your people, the Puerto Ricans can relate to this.  What God is about to say right here.  Do you believe in the Bible?  You sure you believe in the Bible?  I'm going to ask you one more time.  Do you believe in the Bible?  Alright, we're going to go through some deep things.  I want to know if you can stomach it.  Because you're a special people.  A lot of our people don't want to believe.  We tell them they're special, they run their curses out and they drive in their car.  I want to see if you can handle that.  If you can understand how well you are in the sight of the heavenly Father.  Read.  Deuteronomy 28, verse 1.  Right.  And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God.  God said, To observe and to do all his commandments.  To observe and to keep his law, statute, and commandments.  There's over 613 laws God gave to us.  We got to keep every single one of them to the best of our ability.  Read.  Which I command thee this day.  Right.  That the Lord thy God will set thee on high.  God will have put the Puerto Rico on high.  Read.  Above all nations.  Is Puerto Rico making Dubai look like the back alley?  Is Puerto Rico making Beverly Hills look like a trash can?  Right.  Let's see.  So that means we're in curses.  So far Haitians and Puerto Ricans and black Americans we're in curses.  Right.  We're in the bottom.  Right?  I know you got a lot of friends from the hood, right?  I got a lot of friends from the hood.  We suffering as a people, right?  Verse 15.  Verse 15.  Right?  But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.  If the soul of God tie in a voice that don't listen, read.  To observe, to do all his commandments.  To do what?  To observe, to do all his commandments.  Can you spell the word all for me, brother?  A-L-L.  All 613 laws, read.  his commandments right.  and his statue right which i command thee this day right that all these questions all these questions especially a good thing.  i'm asking questions christ is a good thing or is it a bad thing?  a person when you lose your house and now you're in the street that's a curse.  is that a beautiful thing?  is what's happening to puerto rico right now?  is that a beautiful thing?  that's the curse.  let's see if your people can relate to this.  current.  where's 47.  Verse 47.  Verse 47, right?  Because thou servest not the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things.  Because the bereaved one, Titus, wasn't happy to keep God's laws.  When he said women supposed to wear their dress with their fringes.  They're not supposed to wear pants according to the Bible.  That's a law.  They weren't happy to do that.  When God said a woman is under her husband, they were not happy to do that.  When God said men were supposed to have their beards, not push up all their heads, the men wasn't happy to do that.  So now we're suffering the repercussions of that.  Therefore, shalt thou serve thine enemies?  Shalt thou serve thine enemies?  Let me ask you a question, sister.  Who came and conquered the soul of God?  The Spaniards, right?  Now, what is this stuff about Hispanics calling themselves?  Latinos, Spaniards, right?  Those are the same people who was chasing those people in caves with dogs, man.  They were doing that to y'all people, man.  They were burning y'all at the stake when y'all didn't want to accept their white Christ.  That's what these people are doing to you.  God sent them to you.  Because why?  Because he can't accept the wickedness in us.  He cannot deal with them.  Therefore, shalt thou serve thine enemy, which the Lord shall send against thee.  In hunger, in hunger.  Let me ask you a question.  Where do you like to buy your food, sister?  Yeah, where do you like to go at?  To buy your food.  Go out, get a little something to eat.  Chick-fil-A?  Host food?  Caribbean food?  Dutch fry?  all these places.  right?  when you look at who own these places what people own these places i'm gonna i'm gonna.  let you digest that real quick sisters.  we're telling our people who they are.  according to the bible.  they speak english right.  yeah we're telling our people who they are according to the bible.  i want to see if you can relate to what god told his people over 2000 years ago if this happened to your forefathers.  Read verse 47 again.  Verse 47.  Because thou servest not the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things.  Because God said we're supposed to be keeping his law and statute of commandments.  We're supposed to be happy if we keep God's law.  Read.  Therefore, shalt thou serve thine enemies, which the Lord shall send against thee.  Right.  In hunger.  In what?  In hunger.  And you said it.  At the top of these corporations are CEOs of Bravo, Walmart, Publix, Whole Foods.  Who owns these places?  Our enemies.  We don't own it.  Puerto Rican man don't sit up there as a CEO.  Right?  It's our enemies.  The same people who hate us.  They own these places.  Really?  And in thirst.  Right?  And in nakedness.  And in nakedness.  Who owns MK?  MK.  Who owns MK?  That's your brother, right?  Who owns MK?  Who owns Echo, Nike, Ralph Lauren, Giuseppe, Ferragamo?  Who owns these places?  Our people drive these things constantly, right?  Who owns them?  The same people who oppressed you in the islands?  The same people who had my people in the fields?  right read and in want of all things and in everything you want when you want to buy a house when you want to buy a car when you want everything student loan you gotta go to the same people that hates that that like belittle you every day we gotta go to.  is that that doesn't that happen to our people?  don't be don't worry about her.  the most is not dealing with like a lot of these a lot of these elders nowadays because they can't stand up for our people.  right.  they're not teaching you who you are going to the bible.  A lot of the grown men out here, they're supposed to be teaching me on the OMR.  They're supposed to be over here.  Right?  But they're not.  Because the most I've raised men is true men in these last days.  Right?  Really?  And he shall put a yoke of iron.  You should do a what?  And he shall put a yoke of iron.  Because they don't teach your people this in school.  The so-called Puerto Rican Indians, they had chains on them too.  Puerto Rico.  They were shipping them off all throughout Europe.  Just like they were shipping off our people too.  They didn't want us to know we're the same people.  We may look different now, but we're the same people.  We're brothers and sisters, really?  And he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, right?  Until he hath destroyed thee.  Why do you think God didn't let them destroy us?  Why do you think it's just the Puerto Ricans here?  This whole Western Hemisphere was filled with Hispanics and Native Americans.  Why do you think you're still here today?  Let's see why.  Give me Isaiah.  Actually, Deuteronomy 4, verse 37.  Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 37.  There's a reason why you're here today in 2019 learning who you are according to the Bible.  This Bible is your history.  What it teaches you in school is his story, his lies, right?  We, Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 37, right?  And because he loved, because he what?  And because he loved thy fathers, your ancient fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  Your ancestors, right?  He chose them all people.  He gave us his own natural man.  He put his love upon us to be the royalty of this earth.  Really?  Therefore, he chose their seed after them.  Because he loved Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that's why he chose you.  That's why you're here today.  That's why all the Boycott Indians and Taino Indians are not wiped out when the Spaniards came to them.  Go back to where you was at in Deuteronomy.  Back to Deuteronomy, chapter 28.  Read that for me.  Verse 49.  The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far.  God said he will send a nation from far to you, right?  In the islands, right?  From the end of the earth.  Right?  As swift as the eagle flying.  Now, why do you think he said eagle?  Cheetos are fast.  Stockings are fast.  Why do you think he said eagle?  Now, let me ask you a question.  What's the national bread of America?  The what?  The national bread of America.  You want to know?  Do you have a dollar on you?  You have a quarter?  You ought to make me go to my pocket and get a dollar from you.  We got to get through this.  The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flying.  What's the bird behind you on the dollar bill?  What's the bird behind you on this dollar bill?  What bird is that?  It's an eagle.  When you look behind of a quarter, it's an eagle.  The national bird of America is the eagle.  The national bird of Rome was the eagle.  God told you he would send his people to you.  Right, Reeb?  A nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand.  That you're not going to understand their tongue because you were speaking dialects of Hebrew.  Your people wasn't speaking Spanish.  You were beat and taught that.  Just like my people was taught Crayon French.  Reeb?  a nation of fierce continents right which shall not regard the person of the old.  they didn't care about.  your abuela she's gonna be.  she'll be working hard.  read nor show favor to the young they're not.  they're not gonna care.  if you're a nino you're gonna be working twice as hard as the abuela me and he shall eat the food of that cattle and he's gonna eat up all your resources everything you have in that island.  The name Puerto Rico means rich, rich point.  It's not rich right now because they took up everything in that land.  Really?  And the fruit of thy land and everything you have, all your resources.  That's why Puerto Rico don't have nothing.  It's supposed to be a rich land.  The most I gave you that land when you came over here was Deuteronomy 33.  Give me verse 68.  Actually Jeremiah 12 verse 9.  Well, you guys, they want to know who they are according to the Bible.  Give me one minute.  Because in America, our people look at each other, we're different.  God says his people is like a speckled bird.  We look all types of ways.  You got some Puerto Ricans whose dark skin with blue eyes, some light skin with afros, not paired, not paired in minds, right?  Right.  Jeremiah 12 verse 9.  Jeremiah chapter 12 verse 9.  Right.  My heritage is unto me as a speckled bird.  What's so special about a speckled bird?  It looks all types of ways.  It got all different types of colors.  Right.  We're the same people.  All people look at each other, oh, that's from Spanish.  And you look at us, oh, that's Moreno.  And then you got to be on your way.  We're the same people, man, that God chose.  Now that you know you're Israel, right?  Can you agree that your people relate to what God was speaking to his people?  You're an Israelite from the tribe of Ephraim.  You're the chosen daughter of the Most High God, man.  And there's laws you have to keep.  You can't continue being... What's your name?  You can't be Sister Delaina no more.  You gotta be Sister Delaina, the princess of the Most High God.  You gotta keep his commandments now.  Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 1.  Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 1.  Because he requires you to keep his laws, statutes, and commandments.  Learn them, do them, and teach them to your children one day.  You understand?  This thing is supposed to keep going and going and going until our salvation comes.  Read.  Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 1.  Right.  And Moses called all Israel and said unto them, Hear, O Israel.  Hear, O Israel.  Right.  Read.  The statutes.  The what?  The statutes.  The statutes.  Read.  And judgments.  The judgments.  Read.  Which I speak in your ears this day.  Right.  That ye may learn them.  You got to learn them.  I'm going to teach you at least three before you leave.  Read.  And keep.  Keep.  Read.  And do them.  And what?  And do them.  The last part is always the hardest part.  And do them.  No lip service.  The Mosaic God is not dealing with lip service.  Now let's give you about three laws.  Deuteronomy 22 verse 5.  The book of Deuteronomy chapter 22 verse 5.  You did say you believe in the Bible, right?  This Bible is a real book.  It's a history book.  You are the daughter of the Mosaic God, right?  And I'm going to keep saying, you have to keep his commandments.  Deuteronomy chapter 22 verse 5.  Deuteronomy chapter 22 verse 5.  Read.  The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man.  What do you think God is telling you right now?  Read it again for my sister.  The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man.  What do you think that means?  Pants.  God doesn't want his daughter to wear pants.  Because that put a masculine spirit on y'all, man.  That's why a lot of these sisters be going caveman on brothers, man.  Having they men checking the house, they scared to come out.  You have to wear a dress.  That's how you're supposed to adorn yourself, right?  Let me give you an example, right?  How do you tell a man back there from a woman back there?  Dress, right?  Sodom teaches this, man.  But we're taught that what?  A man can wear a dress like young thug and a woman can wear pants.  But most of God is not dealing with that.  Give me Leviticus chapter 11, verse 7.  Bring it out.  Leviticus chapter 11, verse 7.  After today, what you going to start wearing?  You're going to try your hardest, matter of fact.  What you going to do?  You understand that we went in this situation because we broke God's commandments.  The only way to come out of it is we keep His commandments.  You got to try your best to wear your dresses.  Believe it or not, a lot of these brothers are probably going to be sweating you when you wear your dress.  Because it look better when our sisters wear dresses.  Read.  The book of Leviticus chapter 11 verse 7.  And the swine.  And the swine.  What's the swine?  What's swine?  Swine.  S-W-I-N-E.  It's the pig.  The pig, the pork, pig, bacon, and pork bone, read.  Though he divide the hoof.  Even though his feet is like this, right, like goats, right, read.  And be cloven-footed.  Right.  Yet he cheweth not the cud.  He doesn't begrudge his food, read.  He is unclean to you.  He is unclean to you.  He is unclean to you, right, read.  Of their flesh.  Of their what?  Of their flesh.  The bacon, the sausage, man, the pepperoni, read.  Shall ye not eat?  You're not supposed to eat it.  Because it's unclean.  Would you drink a cup of dirty muck water?  Why is that?  Because that's dirty.  You're supposed to look at swine just like that, too.  Really?  And their carcass shall ye not touch.  God is so serious about it, he don't want you touching his dead body.  That's how serious the Mosaic is about it.  But you will see how people eat it, right?  They in sin right now.  The wages of sin is death, man.  That's why we went in slavery.  That's why the Spaniards came and killed your people, man.  Because we continue breaking God's commandments.  Give me Numbers chapter 15 verse 30.  Numbers chapter 15, verse 38.  Book of Numbers chapter 15, verse 38.  Because let me ask you something.  Why do you think the so-called Indians were wearing things like this on their clothes?  Do you know anything about the Native Americans, the Boycott Indians, your ancestors in Puerto Rico?  They used to wear things like this on their clothes, right?  Why do you think they wore that?  Because they're Israelites.  This was given to them according to the Bible.  Let me prove it to you.  The book of Numbers chapter 15 verse 38.  Right.  Speak unto the children of Israel.  God said speak to the so-called blacks and Hispanics.  And bid them.  And command them.  That they make them fringes.  That they make them fringes.  The reason why the Native Americans and so-called Hispanics and Native Indians had those on their clothing is because they knew God told them they have to wear them.  Because that was their law.  That was the law they had to keep.  Where are people supposed to wear fringes?  Let's see why.  Read.  In the borders of their garments throughout their generations.  Children's children's children's children.  Read.  And that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue.  A ribbon of blue, read.  And it shall be unto you for a fringe.  Right, a reminder, read.  That you may look upon it.  Now you're supposed to look at these things, right, read.  And remember all the commandments.  So I'm supposed to remember all the commandments of God.  When you look at it, when you want to read the Epoch, right?  Damn, God say I can't eat this.  That's why I'm suffering.  Let me not eat that.  When I look at you, I look at my sister.  I don't see her heartless.  I don't see a little thought in her.  You understand?  That's why God told us we have to do it.  Give me St.  John 1415, and I think I'm going to deal with the other brothers and sisters.  St.  John 1415.  So you learned quite a few things today, sister.  What are you?  Are you Puerto Rican?  Are you Boica?  What are you?  You're children of God.  In Israel, according to the Bible, we're talking about Ephraim.  All right?  St.  John 14, 15.  That's my last verse for you.  The book of St.  John, chapter 14, verse 15.  Right?  If ye love me.  God said if you love me.  You love the most high God?  Are you sure you love him?  Because he's going to actually prove it.  Really?  If ye love me, keep my commandments.  What do you got to do if you love him?  Keep the commandments.  You learned three today.  There's over 610 more that you got to start learning.  I pray you got a flyer and you contact us and reach out to us.  All right, sister? ",
