            "text": "Hi, Drew.  It's Kel here.  Well, what's going on today?  Well, a very nice young man named Noah, who is a YouTube channel called Country Mouse Livin', has sent me some cigars, and I really appreciate that, Noah.  He actually is a pipe smoker and a cigar smoker.  We decided he doesn't like cigars anymore, so we thought, who better to send those cigars to than Uncle Kel?  So, thank you very much Noah.  I'm going to open them on camera.  Now they're in a plastic bag right now because I couldn't open them the day they came in.  So I wrapped them in a plastic bag.  Keeped them as fresh as I could.  And that way they wouldn't get all dried out and grossed out.  And I'm trying to nut with this.  Mr.  Kel, that's me.  Now the title of this video may be, How to Get Free Cigars.  And the way to get free cigars is very simple.  You go back in time, nine years ago, you start a YouTube channel, you make over a thousand videos, you don't do a very good job, like me, and eventually someone will send you free cigars.  Okay, let me read this online here for you guys.  Sorry for the late shipment, I've been incredibly busy.  There are some good cigars in here.  I know how you like Fuentes.  They may need to be rehydrated.  I just haven't had the time to enjoy them, so I thought I'd pass them along.  I am a huge supporter of the channel, and I always enjoy your videos.  Keep up the good work, and thank you for inspiring me to lose weight.  I'm down 35 pounds.  Wow, that is fantastic.  Noah, that is great.  Noah's kind of following some of my videos on weight loss.  He's always lost 35 pounds.  He's done better than I have, that's for sure.  And that is really fantastic.  I'm looking at the back of my camera.  I should be looking at the thing.  By the way, just a little note here for this video.  I'm using my iPhone camera on a new mount that I got for it and on my tripod to make this video.  So if it seems a little strange, that's why it is.  So he's doing really good with the weight loss and I admire that.  I'm trying to.  I'm still working on it every day.  In fact, I just got back from a workout.  It's Monday today.  And I'm really kind of tired, actually.  It was a hell of a workout.  I really... I didn't overdo, but I didn't... I don't know.  It was a workout.  I just... I did three sets on everything, or maybe four on my legs, actually.  Because I do... leg extensions.  and then I do, today's a chest day, a push day.  And I just, I was going to do four pushes on the chest.  I just literally couldn't do it.  I was just, I was just exhausted.  So I ate some protein powder mixed drink before I went to work out.  I read that was a good idea.  Usually I work out while fasting, but I don't think it's good for me to eat when I work out.  The treadmill was hell.  And after the, after the weightlifting.  So anyway, but anyway, Noah, back to Noah.  Thank you very much, Noah.  You know, I'll tell you something else about this.  It's interesting.  I had a horrible last week, last week on YouTube.  YouTube has been playing more games with me again.  I'd put a video up and they would demonetize it immediately.  The moment it went up, it'd be demonetized.  And it was so frustrating to me.  Then I would change the title and I'd ask for review and... Then they would say, okay, it's okay.  Then I'd put the regular title on again.  They demonetized again and back and forth.  They seemed to just demonetize all my videos initially.  And I was able to get a couple of videos up, get a couple of them up that actually weren't demonetized, which was nice.  You probably noticed that if you've been watching my videos.  And lately they haven't been doing as much.  But what really bugged me is the video that they did this with and played games with me back and forth with was the one about... women and mental illness and wondering what their problem was and trying to figure it out.  I liked that video.  I thought it was a good video.  It wasn't a good video, but I liked the topic.  I thought, you know, it's kind of an important topic for me to do.  And they just kept demonetizing it and screwing around.  And, you know, the only thing mad about it was, if that had been a video of a woman saying, don't date abusive or mentally ill men, it had been featured on YouTube.  But I make a video for men saying, don't date mentally ill, abusive women, which is what I was really saying in that video.  And they keep demonetizing because, of course, you've got to respect women.  You can't say anything bad about women.  No, no, no.  So I was very, very, very, very, very depressed.  So depressed about it, as a matter of fact, I was actually having thoughts of just quitting YouTube.  I didn't, I don't get mad at me about this, I wasn't actually going to do it, but it just occurred to me, what am I doing this for?  You know, what am I here for?  You know, if they're going to mess with me every time I turn around and make my life miserable, it's just insulting to me for them to demonetize my videos.  maybe i should just quit.  you know i i i didn't actually think about seriously but i just kept feeling that way like i'm just i'm just wasting my time here.  you know figuring i'd be doing that to my videos.  and then this package arrived and i was like man.  i am appreciated by some folks out there and it just made me feel so good and just the fact that it did arrive i just felt so much better.  um After that, so Noah, you saved my channel a little bit.  I'm not sure what I would have done.  I mean, I was actually that upset about it.  So Noah and people like Noah and my people at Patreon, they've got a few people there.  These people have saved this channel because YouTube has been after me now for a year or two, demonetizing videos, deleting videos, shadow banning videos.  They don't really promote my videos anymore.  I put them in the stream to be seen, it seems like to me.  You know, They don't like some of the things I have to say because they're liberals.  They're rabid SJW liberals and I'm not.  And the Patreon and this kind of thing really has helped me to launch me to say, you know, I'm just going to keep fighting.  You know, so let's take a look here.  I'm just going to pull them out of the box here.  Come up over here like this.  Look at them one at a time.  Oh my.  These are Fuente cigars.  Look at the name here.  I'm not finding anything.  And these are Esquisitos Maduro.  See what it says?  It says Esquisitos Maduro.  You know, I like my Maduro cigars.  I love my Maduro cigars.  They're my favorites.  Look at this here.  Wow, this is amazing.  Arturo Fuente.  Noah, you're doing a great thing for me.  I got to say, thank you very much, sir.  By the way, I'm going to put a link to Noah's channel below.  Noah started out doing pipe videos and maybe some cigar videos.  I'm not sure.  Maybe pipe videos, I think.  And other car videos.  Now he's doing many pipe videos, I think, but other things, too.  He's got a very interesting little channel.  He's an interesting person to watch.  So my advice is to go to his channel.  He did a great thing for Kel.  Do a great thing for him.  Go to his channel and check out channel please.  oh oh this is really cool.  oh this is really cool.  it's like christmas.  it's christmas at kel's house it's christmas in the bunker.  these are little tiny cigars.  now i know i smoke gigantic cigars on my channel all the time but the truth of it is i'm always wishing i had a small little cigar like days like today when it's like 40 degrees outside and i wouldn't be having a cigar.  but i don't want to spend an hour and a half on the cold.  And also, oh, that is just fantastic, Noah.  Thank you so very much.  This kind of thing is a perfect cigar, like if I go out to the Harley dealership, there's a thing this next weekend.  If I go out to the Harley dealership and hang out for a while, it'd be nice to have a smaller cigar to smoke, you know, for a few minutes.  I did that several years ago.  I went to an event somewhere here in town.  I wasn't on my Harley, but, and it was a park, and they were having something going on.  And I had one of those little cigars like this.  Again, someone actually gifted me, actually.  I think it was a Cuban cigar, and I smoked it at the event.  It was just a nice, short, small little smoke.  Look at this whole box of them.  My God.  Noah, thank you so much.  And this is just the beginning.  I appreciate this so awfully much.  It's fantastic.  Let me see here.  Get a smell here.  Ah, I smell the cedar and the maduro and the alturo fuente.  That is so nice.  God, no, I don't know what to say.  I'm going to just put these over here for now on the edge of the bed.  Oh, you sent me some Prince Albert cherry vanilla pipe tobacco.  Cherry vanilla used to be my favorite pipe tobacco.  So thank you very much.  Prince Albert.  And I kind of like cheaper pipe tobacco sometimes.  I don't need that fancy handmade, you know, stuff like that all the time.  So that's very nice too.  Thank you.  Let me get a whiff of this.  It's been open already?  I think it has.  Nice one.  It smells really good.  I'm not getting piped back on my friends.  Put it all over here.  Can I keep it separate?  Oh, my.  No, for heaven's sakes.  I'm seeing something.  Oh, my God.  No, thank you so much.  I'm seeing something that's even cooler in there.  Now, these are Arturo Frente.  Arturo Frente.  I can't read it.  Cubanitos.  Let's open this up.  Where's my knife?  I have a knife here somewhere.  I usually have a knife here.  Oh, I know what I have.  I do have a knife here somewhere.  Come here, you.  My little, my favorite little knives.  I always have this on my desk.  My little Swiss Army knife.  It's a great little knife.  It's got a pair of scissors on one side and it's got a knife and a file on the other.  And I actually use it to file my, I clip my fingernails.  I use this actually to file my fingernails.  It's very handy.  And for stuff like this.  Let's open this one up here.  Again, smaller cigars, and I kind of like that.  I always want to buy the smaller cigars.  Every time I go to buy a load of cigars from somewhere, I always look at the small cigars, but I don't buy them because I keep getting lured by the big, giant cigars.  And I always want some small cigars.  This is kind of like Christmas, but I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I always want them.  Look at this.  There's the bot.  I love these little tins.  And in fact, I've been to my local a lot lately here, buying cigars here all the past few months.  But once every three weeks, I go to the local and I buy some cigars.  And every single time, I look at these little tins like this.  But I'm like, oh, I want a big cigar.  And I buy a big cigar.  I keep getting lured by the big cigar.  Check this out.  That's the interior of that.  I think... I think... Yes, this little AF, Atero Fuente, is like a little sticker.  It's like Christmas.  God, no, thank you so much.  It's like Christmas for Kel.  A little sticker there.  You have to kind of cut it off or whatever.  I don't know if I can get that out without... Instead of cutting it, let me see if I can just peel it off here.  Oh, I could.  I was able to peel it off.  Look at that.  I peeled one off.  Let me see here.  I can't.  I can't.  Cubanitos.  These are Cubanitos.  And again, a nice little small surround.  Oh, these are nice.  Oh, wow.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that, boys and girls.  I hope my camera's working.  I have to read a minute to read a video if I have to.  Look at that.  Look at those little beauties in here.  Those are really nice.  Really, really nice.  There's one here that's backwards.  It has the thing on backwards so you can grab it out.  Let's pull this out and take a look here.  I don't think I'll unwrap it.  Boy, that's a nice little cigar.  That is so nice.  I always want to buy them, but I never do.  But I always want them.  That is nice.  Oh, that is really nice.  And that looks good to be not a Maduro wrapper, but I like non-Maduro wrappers too.  In fact, I buy so much Maduro wrappers, sometimes I find myself kind of craving non-Maduro wrappers.  In fact, I've got those.  I've smoked a couple on camera already.  I've got those Partagas Admirantes, and those are non-Maduro, and I'm really enjoying those.  So I smoke so much Maduros, I end up, you know.  And these two boxes... are the same thing.  I won't open these.  I'll let these stay in plastic so they stay good and fresh.  Gosh, no, thank you so much.  And there's more of them here to come.  Let me see here.  He sent me... Oh, my God.  Noah.  I'm not worthy.  Really, I'm not.  He sent me a humidor as well.  Oh, my gosh.  No, thank you so much.  It's a burrow humidor.  My favorite burrow.  I like burrows.  Burrows are like my favorite.  Oh, no, thank you so much.  There it is inside there.  A little humidor.  Ah!  Ah, it bit my hand.  And it's got a little one of these little humidifier things in it.  I think it sticks on here.  Let's see if I can stick it on here.  There you go.  There you go.  Like you never can get on a human horse, you know what I'm saying?  Well, Noah, thank you so much.  Is that everything?  Oops.  Sorry.  Sorry.  The box hit my computer and had a video on there.  We'll try to make it run.  Thank you so much, Noah.  Thank you very, very, very much.  And you guys, please, please check out his channel.  If I can figure out how to do it, if I can figure out how to do it, I will... I will put one of those things that pops over here.  I don't usually do this in my videos, but I'll put one of these things too that pops over.  You can just click on it and go right to the channel.  Go to Noah's channel and please subscribe.  He's a good young man.  And I really appreciate the support to my channel.  You know, if you don't make YouTube videos, if you don't make YouTube videos, it's hard to understand what a lot of YouTube people go through to do that.  You know, I'm not making a sob story here, but especially with the way YouTube is now where it demonetizes videos and shadow bans people and it deletes videos.  I've got two strikes in my account right now because I dared to say something that was politically incorrect.  It wasn't liberal.  You know, and that's always a threat that they're going to delete my channel and stuff, you know, and it's frustrating and it should be fun.  It should be fun, but it just isn't all the times.  And, and, and, but stuff like this makes it fun.  And, and for me, it's fun talking to you guys on camera, like when I'm smoking a cigar on the back deck.  So those things make up for it.  And right now, the way YouTube is, I kind of need to make up for a few things.  So, well, thank you so much, Noah.  Again, that was very nice.  And please go to his channel and subscribe.  This guy is just starting out.  He's a young man.  starting out on youtube and uh you need some subs right now.  so go there this whole box.  look at this box these little things little babies.  i may go out in the back deck in the cold and smoke when he's right tonight.  matter of fact today it's about uh 5 21 in the afternoon here i might go in the morning.  so anyway thank you very much.  no i appreciate it.  thank you guys for watching and thank you guys for supporting me as well.  thank you for for subscribing And please do, if you haven't, click the little bell.
