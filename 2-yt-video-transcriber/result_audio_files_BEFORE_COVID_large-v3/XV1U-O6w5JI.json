Recently, she unveiled a suite of new legislation that she is calling a just society.  You probably didn't hear about it because she decided to introduce her plan the day after Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry against President Trump, and the same day that the Ukraine transcript was released.  Brilliant.  Now, most congresspeople submit bills and maybe put out a press release and maybe hold a small press conference, but not AOC.  Everything this woman does has to be a media event, even when she goes to a parking lot down at the border.  So the congresswoman announced her plan to the public through a video, a NowThis News exclusive, and it's a mess. ",

As part of AOC's previous initiative, the Green New Deal, Every building would be required to achieve maximum energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort and durability.  Then, once the building is upgraded to meet those new standards, your property will be reassessed and likely go up in value.  And that means your property taxes will go up.  And that means you'll need to raise the rent to help pay for it all.  But in a just society, if you're not allowed to raise the rent high enough, the landlord will have to eat those costs.  Of course, an alternative would be to find new tenants who are willing to pay more in rent and sign a new lease, right?  Nope, you can't do that either, because the bill also limits what a property owner can do with their own property.  For example, a landlord can only evict a tenant if they have either failed to pay rent for two months in a row, if they have caused substantial destruction to the property or violate an explicit lease term.  So you better make sure that that lease agreement is airtight.  Because unless you explicitly say no animal hoarding, you might be stuck with a sh**ty tenant for life.  And the only other way you can force a tenant to leave is if the landlord seeks to occupy the unit or seeks the availability of the unit for occupancy by an immediate relative.  So if you're a landlord, make sure that you have a very large family. ",

So, as a landlord, even if you think the lease agreement is airtight and you have the right to evict a tenant under AOC's law, you're still probably going to have to appear before a judge.  I don't like you paying too much on rent.  You are, and it is extortion.  My rent and the amount that we are paying is absolutely too high and it is criminal.  It is outrageous.

So even if a contractor comes in with a low bid, a contractor with a higher score will get priority, like whether an employer guarantees 12 weeks or more paid family or paternal leave annually.  Of course, the employers that are able to offer perks like that are likely very rich companies, so great job, AOC. ",

Iran, Qatar, North Korea, Somalia, China, Yemen, Syria, Russia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, and so much more.  So why isn't the UN doing anything to make sure that all of these countries are abiding by the terms of the covenant?  It's bogus.  It's a scam.  Exactly.  Big announcement, everyone.
