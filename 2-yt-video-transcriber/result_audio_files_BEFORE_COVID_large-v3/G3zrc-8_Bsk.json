            "text": "Hi, this is Dr.  Pchenik, and let's talk about Jeff Epstein's supposed suicide.  Whether he committed suicide or he's dead or they took him out of jail is really not relevant.  What happened today with Jeff Epstein is a travesty of justice and the law, but also of our intelligence system.  Several weeks ago, on July 15, 16, I saw the story being developed where So Epstein decided that he was going to commit suicide and he had a rope around his neck and had marks on his neck and there was a member in his cell, which was absurd.  Of course, Epstein was in his cell now by himself.  His dynamic is such that he would never commit suicide.  He's too narcissistic, bombastic.  I've treated guys like this.  They don't commit suicide.  What we do is we take them out.  And remember what I said a month ago, several months ago, he works for Mossad and the CIA.  Why?  Because he compromised so many political and economic figures that it was important for all of you to understand this wasn't just an individual.  This is a system that we funded and that we've been an alliance to the Mossad and the Jewish Americans who are leading us.  Jeffrey Epstein.  as I said to you, is an operative.  He's a poor jerk of a low level Jewish guy who never amounted to anything and was grandiose.  The fact of the matter is that he had compromised a lot of people using make-believe money and a fictional background.  What really is true is the following, and most of you did not follow this.  Two days ago, a member of our military was appointed as director of national intelligence.  McGuire, a vice admiral of military intelligence.  Now, why is that important and what does that have to do with Epstein?  Everybody wonders.  The answer is very simple.  Military intelligence, which I've been part of for over four decades, is the only institution that we can rely on that will not be compromised by the Mossad.  In turn, what happened is two days ago, Susan Gordon, who was the deputy of national intelligence behind Clapper and others, was not appointed to become director of national intelligence.  Now, why is that related to Epstein?  Because Susan Gordon is Jewish, and she was close to John Brennan, who's close to the Mossad.  So Trump, in his wisdom, as crazy as people think, was a fox. ",
