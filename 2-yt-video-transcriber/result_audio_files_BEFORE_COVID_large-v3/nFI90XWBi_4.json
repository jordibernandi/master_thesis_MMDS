            "text": "Not at all.  First of all, there's no such thing as mid-tribulation.  Because that's predicated on there being a seven year tribulation.  There's not one scripture in the entire Bible for a seven year tribulation.  Even though everybody teaches it, all the commentaries teach it, not one scripture.  But there are six specific scriptures that teach a three and one half year tribulation.  Daniel 7, 25, the antichrist will make war against the saints for time, times, half a time.  Revelation 13, 5, power was given unto the beast to continue 42 months.  He made war against the saints and overcame them.  Revelation 12, verse 5 and 6, the dragon made war against the woman for 1,260 days.  1,260 days is 3 1\u20442 years.  42 months, 3 1\u20442 years.  Time, times, half a time, 42 months.  Did I say that right?  3 1\u20442 years.  So every single reference to the great tribulation in the Bible is 3 1\u20442 years.  There is a seven-year period called Daniel's 70th week.  Mm-hmm.  But the great tribulation does not start until halfway through.  Jesus taught that explicitly.  He said in Matthew 24, 15, when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation.  Mm-hmm.  Spoken of a Daniel prophet.  Mm-hmm.  which Daniel said happens in the middle of the week, in the middle of that seven year period.  When you see that, then if you're in Judea, flee because then will be great tribulation such as never been before nor ever shall be.  So Jesus taught that the abomination of desolation which happens halfway through the seven year period, that's the trigger for the great tribulation.  So, the Great Tribulation will be the last half.  The first thing that happens is the signing of the peace agreement, which President Trump has already now.  He wants to do it right now. ",

I got to Revelation 20, verse 4 through 6.  I read there where it said, I saw those that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus.  They did not take the mark.  They did not worship these.  These lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.  This is the first resurrection.  that froze me in my tracks.  Wait, are you telling me the people that don't take the mark, when they're resurrected, that's the first one?  What's my resurrection?  I'm teaching it's supposed to happen seven years before this.
