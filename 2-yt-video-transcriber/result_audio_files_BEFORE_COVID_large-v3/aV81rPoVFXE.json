            "text": "Member Nunes, for any remarks you may wish to make.  Thanks, gentlemen.  In a July open hearing of this committee following publication of the Mueller report, the Democrats engaged in a last-ditch effort to convince the American people that President Trump is a Russian agent.  That hearing was the pitiful finale of a three-year-long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media, and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election.  After the spectacular implosion of their Russia hoax on July 24, in which they spent years denouncing any Republican who ever shook hands with a Russian, on July 25, They turned on a dime and now claim the real malfeasance is Republicans' dealings with Ukraine.  In the blink of an eye, we're asked to simply forget about Democrats on this committee, falsely claiming they had more than circumstantial evidence of collusion between President Trump and Russians.  We should forget about them reading fabrications of Trump-Russia collusion from the Steele dossier.  into the congressional record.  We should also forget about them trying to obtain nude pictures of Trump from Russian pranksters who pretended to be Ukrainian officials.  We should forget about them leaking a false story to CNN while he was still testifying to our committee claiming that Donald Trump Jr.  was colluding with WikiLeaks.  and forget about countless other deceptions, large and small, that make them the last people on earth with the credibility to hurl more preposterous accusations at their political opponents.  And yet now, here we are.  We're supposed to take these people at face value when they trot out a new batch of allegations.  But anyone familiar with the Democrats' scorched earth war against President Trump would not be surprised to see all the typical signs that this is a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign.  For example, after vowing publicly that impeachment requires bipartisan support, Democrats are pushing impeachment forward without the backing of a single Republican.  The witnesses deemed suitable for television by the Democrats were put through a closed-door audition process in a cult-like atmosphere in the basement of the Capitol, where Democrats conducted secret depositions, released a flood of misleading and one-sided leaks, and later selectively released transcripts in a highly staged manner.  Violating their own guidelines, Democrats repeatedly redacted from the transcripts the name of Alexandra Chalupa, a contractor for the Democratic National Committee who worked with Ukrainian officials to collect dirt on the Trump campaign, which she provided to the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign.  The Democrats rejected most of the Republicans' witness requests.  resulting in a horrifically one-sided process where the crucial witnesses are denied a platform if their testimony does not support the Democrats' absurd accusations.  Notably, they are trying to impeach the president for inquiring about Hunter Biden's activities.  Yet they refuse our request to hear from Biden himself.  The whistleblower was acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump, and his attorney touted a coup against the president and called for his impeachment just weeks after the election.  At a prior hearing, Democrats on this committee read out a purely fictitious rendition of the president's phone call with President Zelensky.  They clearly found the real conversation to be insufficient for their impeachment narrative.  So they just made up a new one.  And most egregiously, the staff of the Democrats on this committee had direct discussions with the whistleblower before his or her complaint was submitted to the Inspector General.  Republicans can't get a full account of these contacts because Democrats broke their promise to have the whistleblower testify to this committee.  Democrat members hid these contacts from Republicans and then lied about them to the American people on national television.  I've noted before the Democrats have a long habit of accusing Republicans of offenses they themselves are committing.  Let's recall, for years they accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia when they themselves were colluding with Russia by funding and spreading the Steele dossier which relied on Russian sources.  And now they accuse President Trump of malfeasance in Ukraine when they themselves are culpable.  The Democrats cooperated and they defend Hunter Biden's securing of a lavishly paid position with a corrupt Ukrainian company.  All while his father served as vice president.  Despite this hypocrisy, the Democrats are advancing their impeachment sham.  But we should not hold any hearings at all until we get answers to three crucial questions the Democrats are determined to avoid asking.  First, what is the full extent of the Democrats' prior coordination with the whistleblower?  And who else did the whistleblower coordinate this effort with?  Second, what is the full extent of Ukraine's election meddling against the Trump campaign?  And third, why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden?  And what did he do for them?  And did his position affect any US government actions under the Obama administration?  These questions will remain outstanding because Republicans were denied the right to call witnesses that know these answers.  What we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats.  Ambassador Taylor and Mr.  Kent, I'd like to welcome you here.  I'd like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats' star chamber auditions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol.  It seems you agreed, witting or unwittingly, to participate in a drama.  But the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you've been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel.  I'll conclude by noting the immense damage the politicized bureaucracy has done to Americans' faith in government.  Though executive branch employees are charged with implementing the policy set by our president, who is elected and responsible to the American people, elements of the civil service have decided that they, not the president, are really in charge.  Thus, as we'll learn in these hearings, After expressing skepticism of foreign aid and concern about foreign corruption on the campaign trail, President Trump outraged the bureaucracy by acting skeptically about foreign aid and expressing concerns about foreign corruption.  Officials' alarm at the president's actions was typically based on secondhand, thirdhand, and even fourthhand rumors and innuendo.  They believed it was an outrage for the president to fire an ambassador.  even though the president has full authority to retain or remove diplomats for any reason at any time.  Officials show the surprising lack of interest in the indications of Ukrainian election meddling that deeply concern the president at whose pleasure they serve.  Despite all their dissatisfaction with President Trump's Ukraine policy, the president approved the supply of weapons to Ukraine.  unlike the previous administration, which provided blankets as defense against invading Russians.  By undermining the president, who they are supposed to be serving, the elements of the FBI, the Department of Justice, and now the State Department, have lost the confidence of millions of Americans who believe that their vote should count for something.  It will take years, if not decades, to restore faith in these institutions.  This spectacle is doing great damage to our country.  It's nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime.
