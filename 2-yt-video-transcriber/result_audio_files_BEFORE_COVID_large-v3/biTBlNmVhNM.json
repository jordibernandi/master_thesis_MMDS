            "text": "Hello, beautiful people.  I am Oliver Perrin for Semiagog, and tonight we'll be talking about saving the world.  Why are the socialists, commies, and other utopians pushing the Green New Deal?  The answer is simple.  They want to erode and eventually destroy private property rights.  It's all about state control.  It has nothing to do with the environment.  They want power.  To the extent that they move to seize power nationally, they operate nationally.  But this is always only a stepping stone.  After all, the need to save the planet is an archetypal example of a global problem.  And global problems demand global solutions.  And so a global authority will be required.  And because nothing could be more important than saving the planet, that authority will increasingly erode and eventually destroy all private property rights under color of rescuing the planet from imminent destruction.  How could you yourself be allowed to choose how to use your land or how to consume energy, how you travel, what you eat, how much of a given thing you're allowed to do or required to do?  To leave all of that up to you would be to risk total global annihilation in just 12 years.  They'll have to take control, and they'll be happy to explain that it's for your own good, not just for your good, but for the good of the environment.  Is it even possible to imagine a more imprecise, a less definite general object of abject do-goodery?  If you don't believe me, just look to regions where there's private property, and that means the West.  This is where, this alone is where, you'll find insane amounts of money being dumped into creating ever greater hysteria related to the coming ice age, the coming global warming, or the more recent, though safer and utterly meaningless phrase, climate change.  One could just as inanely and just as irremediably proclaim our anxiety in the face of physical change.  In the face of biological change.  Yes, what am I going to do about that?  I continue to change physically.  Something must be done.  Yeah, well, good luck with that.  Let us leave aside the West with its enlightened private property rights.  Let's look to where the state has absolute control.  China's a good example.  Private property there is an illusion.  Private ownership is superficially entertained or aped by the party only in the international corporate borderlands where China has to do business with the outside world.  But because the state already has totalitarian control, there's no fashionable current year movement to cripple the Chinese economy in order to save the environment.  Try going gagging, I'm sorry, jogging in Beijing.  China is a polluted shithole of staggering proportions.  If it was all really about saving the planet, the Chinese would probably be doing something.  They'd have as much to lose as we do if any of this bullshit were true, but they're not doing anything because they've already established complete control like the totalitarian commies they actually are.  We're the ones who have to do something.  We're the ones who have to take action.  And that's because we're the ones who still have private property rights.  That's what all of this is about.  Let's just tell the truth and shame the devil.  The Paris Climate Accord and similar psychological warfare instruments, similar pretexts and provocations like the New Green Deal have never been about the environment.  Rather, they're yet further attempts to mobilize overly credulous morons in mindless service of increasing global socialist control of, well... Everything.  That's what we're dealing with here.  Another rallying cry to drive the faithful out of their Starbucks and their collaborative workspaces, out of their spin classes and climate lobby meetings, out of their ayahuasca huts and hair salons, out into the streets to demand something be done about the imminent global catastrophe that confronts us.  As the old saying goes, There's another sucker born every minute.  Get it?  Got it?  Good.  Semiagog, out.  Bravo! ",
