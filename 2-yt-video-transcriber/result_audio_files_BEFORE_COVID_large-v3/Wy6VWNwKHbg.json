            "text": "Anything.  times zero equals zero.  Simple multiplication.  So 50 Democrats can run.  19 are now running.  But if your message is zero, it's a big zero.  There's no strategy, I see.  You've got Beto O'Rourke and you've got Cory Booker promising that they would nominate a woman to be the VP.  Do they not think the women running are good enough to be president?  Stop the nonsense, everybody, about.  we are for all women.  We are pro-women.  We're for independent thinkers.  You have Elizabeth Warren running for president.  She tried to appropriate somebody else's ethnicity.  She lied about that.  They've got a bunch of, I like to say, I don't see any presidential timber yet, just presidential wood chips.  And, you know, the women are complaining, too.  I see women on TV complaining about the female candidates aren't covered the same.  That's just hogwash.  They just have terrible ideas.  But you can change the A to an O and get oh my instead of Amy there because I don't think that was a very impressive rollout.  Kirsten Gillibrand this weekend in her 50s apparently was the first time she's ever eaten fried chicken and she waited for the cameras to roll.  I mean, this is just silly stuff.  The only difference between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is Bernie Sanders' ideas are terrible for America.  And Donald Trump was a much better candidate, had connected tissue with the people.  I think Biden's timing actually benefits him because the Democrats seem really desperate to find an alternative to Bernie Sanders.  Is Joe Biden not endorsing Obamacare the way Obama's not endorsing Joe Biden?  I wonder.  You brought up Charlottesville.  No, I'm bringing up white supremacy and how.  this president has condemned it again and again, and people are lying about that.  Let's go back to the original question.  And Joe Biden thinks he should raise that again.  We can talk about that in a second.  He brought it up.  He has no vision, and he doesn't want to be held to account for the Obama-Biden legacy.  My question was... Oh, we must be worried about Biden.  Look what Kellyanne said about it today.  So thanks for the free commercial about all the things Joe Biden didn't get done for the eight years he was vice president. ",
