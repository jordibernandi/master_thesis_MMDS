I know I always say that, and I always mean it.  And this week we got calls to  J.J.,  Howie Carr, a Fat Master call, plus a new show called Dick and Skippy in the Morning.  First, though, we've been trying to get on the Dennis Prager show forever.  And guess what, baby?  We did it this week.  Check it out. ",
