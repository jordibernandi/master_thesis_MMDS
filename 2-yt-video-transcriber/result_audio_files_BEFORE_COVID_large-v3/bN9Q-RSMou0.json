            "text": "This photo was taken on February 2, 1989, outside a Dimmock's bookstore in Sydney, Australia.  Members of the Free Speech Committee and the Australian Society of Authors were protesting the decision of two booksellers not to sell copies of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses.  Here's a story from the Sydney Morning Herald on February 23, 1989.  Talk of Sydney ban as copies dry up.  Since Ayatollah Khomeini helped turn Salman Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses into headline news, public demand for the book is at fever pitch.  Ironically, copies of the book in Sydney are very rare.  A plane load of hardcover copies express freighted from England and retailing for $35 is expected to go on sale later next week.  But who will put it on their shelves?  The Dimex chain of bookshops has decided it will not stock the book.  Other retailers are expected to follow suit.  According to one book industry source, the major retailers are talking among themselves and may be considering a blanket ban on the book sale.  And what did the Ayatollah's fatwa and the bookshop's decision do to actual demand for the book?  The Ariel Bookshop in Paddington reports about 10 requests a day for copies.  Since the newspaper stories broke, it claims every third or fourth person asks about it.  It has 200 copies on back order.  In Parramatta, Collins Booksellers says about a million people every day are asking for copies.  Penguin Books, which holds the publishing rights to the book, has already received 2,500 orders from booksellers around Australia for the $35 hardcover edition.  According to Penguin's head office in Melbourne, these should be on the shelves from early next week.  And that was just Sydney, Australia.  Consider what happened elsewhere.  Although British bookseller W.H.  Smith sold a mere 100 copies a week of the book in mid-January 1989, it flew off the shelves following the fatwa.  In America, it sold an unprecedented five times more copies than the number two book, Star, by Danielle Steele, selling more than 750,000 copies of the book by May 1989. b dalton a bookstore chain that decided not to stop the book for security reasons changed its mind when it found the book was selling so fast that even as we tried to stop it it was flying off the shelves.  rushdie earned about two million within the first year of the book's publication and the book is viking's all-time bestseller.  Now, whilst the Salman Rushdie affair is not completely analogous to New Zealand bookshop Whitcull's decision to cease sales of Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life, it does present some striking parallels.  First, the attempt to suppress the book will only lead to more publicity for it.  Not that Peterson needs it.  12 Rules for Life has already sold over 3 million copies as of January this year.  Second, when a robust defense of free speech and freedom of expression is most needed, those you expect to put up such a defense, such as a major bookstore chain, shirk the task.  It's not even clear from Whitcoul's weaselly statement why they made the decision.  They refer to, quote, \"...some extremely disturbing material being circulated prior, during, and after the Christchurch  attacks.\".  Some have speculated it has something to do with this photo Peterson took with a fan on February 19th in New Zealand with the words, I'm a proud Islamophobe on his shirt, along with a list of less than charitable claims about Islam.  And before you start frothing at the mouth in the comments about how everything on that shirt is true, man, That's not the point.  I couldn't care less.  what's on the shirt.  The fact is, Peterson has had his photo taken with thousands of people that turn up to his lectures.  Does he vet every one of their t-shirts before taking photos?  Did he even notice what was on the guy's t-shirt?  Remember, Peterson was put through similar questioning by the CBC because he had his photo taken with some guys sporting a Pepe flag. ",

It's the one thing that has been photographed that the left in particular has been using against me for the last year.  But it was just happenstance more than anything else.  Most of the people who are using this sort of symbol are using it in a deeply satirical way.  Now, the fact that the far right has decided that it's a radical indicator of the validity of their particular view doesn't mean that that's what it is. ",

            "text": "In my opinion, Peterson rebuffed that perfectly.  For those who weren't aware, in 2016, Pepe memes were being used, as Peterson said, for satire more than anything to trigger emotionally compromised leftists.  And it worked a treat, just like the NPC meme has.  I retweeted a few myself, whilst at the same time repudiating the alt-right.  And as Peterson says, just because unsavory types adopt something as their own symbol doesn't mean that that is now what it stands for.  But it is convenient for those that want to discredit Peterson to interpret it that way.  Ironically, 12 Rules for Life does not contain the word Islam and only contains the word Muslim once, but not in a negative context.  Remember, the full title of the book is 12 Rules for Life, an Antidote to Chaos.  As Connor Friedersdorf, a staff writer at The Atlantic, wrote in response to Whitcoul's statement, if this is accurate, it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of both Jordan Peterson and his book.  If a genie gave us a chance to go back in time in an attempt to prevent the New Zealand shooting, but only by giving the shooter one book to read, that might be the best choice.  Put less cryptically, Peterson seems able to reach people who'd otherwise be taken in by the most toxic corners of the internet and channel their frustrations into a constructive program of self-improvement.  That is his big effect on the world, not all the culture war stuff.  And of course, Peterson himself has made this point numerous times. ",

Newshub New Zealand reported yesterday that Whitcalls has Islam Unmasked available for purchase, which claims to expose the lies behind Islamic doctrines and the futility of Islamic practices.  However, when I conducted a search for it today, March 23rd, it returned, sorry, no results found.  Have they now removed this title as well?  And if so, where does it end?  The good news is that the Satanic Verses is still available.  Now, it appears Whitcalls might be having some regrets given the blowback from their decision.  Here's what happens when you do a Google search for Whitcalls' Twitter account.  Oops.  And ditto for their Facebook page.  So who knows why Whitcalls made the decision to stop selling Peterson's book?  Have they gotten carried away like others by the need to show solidarity in the wake of the Christchurch attacks?  Are they reacting to this photo?  Whatever the case, you'd think a bookstore would have a little more historical perspective before banning the sale of books.  I mean, I'm sure they have a history section, or have they banned that too?  Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.  I'll see you next time. ",
