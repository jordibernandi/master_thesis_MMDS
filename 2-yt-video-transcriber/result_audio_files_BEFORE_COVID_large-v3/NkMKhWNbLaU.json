            "text": "Hey, it's Kay.  And this is Skittles, my chief statistician.  Today we're gonna talk about a terrifying group of terrorist super soldiers.  They call them... Antifa.  Antifa.  Ant... Antifa.  Antif... Antifa.  Anyway, they're bad.  And then you go on YouTube, you can watch all these videos.  It is scary.  And we should also urge everyone to consider pressing this idea of declaring Antifa a terrorist organization.  This has been going on for years at this point.  Unrestrained mass violence by the left.  And the government is doing nothing.  Organized Aunt Effa cells have been doing... something.  Hang on, I didn't really do a lot of research for this video.  Maybe I should just, uh... Oh.  Antifa isn't an acronym for some shady organization.  It's just shorthand for antifascist.  And anyone who materially opposes fascism is one.  It's not a centralized group.  There's no membership.  It defines an activity.  A strategy.  Huh.  Maybe I'd better take a look at some reports on terrorism and double-check some of my numbers here.  Oh.  Oh.  According to a database of nine years of domestic terrorism incidents compiled by the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting, which includes all terrorist incidents in the U.S.  that could be reasonably linked to a political ideology between 2008 and 2016, left-wing terrorism is actually pretty minor.  There were 19 left-wing terrorist incidents compared to 63 Islamist incidents and 115 right-wing incidents.  Now, this report includes both successful and foiled terror attacks.  Do you notice anything interesting about that?  Let's put a pin in that for a moment.  Before we get into right-wing and Islamist terrorism, I want to take a look at the crimes of Antifa.  There may only have been 19 incidents, but based on what Ben Sharpedo has told me, they're sure to be horrific.  Curiously, only seven deaths are accounted for as a result of left-wing terrorism in this nine-year period.  However, since there were so few left-wing terrorist incidents, it is much more fair to look at what percent of these incidents resulted in fatalities.  According to the report, left-wing terrorist incidents had the lowest rate of fatalities at around 10-11% of incidents resulting in deaths.  just behind Islamic terror and miles behind right-wing terror.  And keep in mind that the percentage of foiled Islamic terror plots is massive on account of the war on terror primarily focusing on them.  The relatively low police interest in right-wing terror plots, despite there being twice as many right-wing incidents as Islamist incidents, likely contributed to them being nearly three times more likely to result in fatalities.  So let's take a look at these 19 left-wing terrorist incidents to get to the bottom of why so few of them resulted in fatalities.  Only a 10% fatality rate means that in this nine-year period, only two of these incidents resulted in deaths.  12 of the 19 incidents were carried out by environmentalist and or animal liberation groups.  Nearly all of them are tied to the animal liberation front.  These 12 include property damage, vandalism, and unleashing thousands of minks on an unsuspecting countryside.  These are undeniably ideologically driven criminal acts, but it's noteworthy that most of these incidents at no point had human targets.  and nobody was injured or killed in any of them, though some of them did include threats.  There were also several incidents targeting the Republican Party.  A Republican office was firebombed with nobody in it, and several people were caught planning to use Molotovs to cause power outages at a Republican convention.  Again, no human targets, just institutional ones.  That brings us to the two incidents out of the 19 that we can establish had a clear intention to wound or kill human beings.  The first incident took place in Dallas in 2016.  Micah Xavier Johnson, an Afghan war veteran who was reportedly acting on his anger over the unjust murder of black men by the police, set out with the explicit goal to shoot white police officers.  And he did, killing five of them before being killed himself.  He had reportedly liked several black nationalist pages on Facebook, but there are no known ties between Micah and anti-fascist groups.  The second incident was the shooting of two police officers in 2014 carried out by Ismail Abdullah Brinsley, who reportedly made an Instagram post announcing his intention to kill police officers as retribution for the murders of Eric Garner and Mike Brown, which he then acted upon.  Ishmael had ties to a prison gang called the Black Guerrilla Family, who certainly had left-wing origins but are not considered to represent those ideas very much today.  Ishmael also had no known ties to anti-fascism.  These two incidents stand out from the other 17 because they were carried out with the explicit intent to kill, which we've established is not typically the case with left-wing terrorism.  And the 19 left-wing terrorist incidents detailed in this report stand out from right-wing and Islamic terror in that even when they do have human targets, they do not target random civilians.  They are different in character in that their targets are part of either the state or capitalist apparatus.  They attack fur stores, they attack Republican headquarters, they attack police officers.  In 2017, so just outside the range of this report, a left-wing activist attacked Republican Congressman Steve Scalise at a baseball game, also injuring an aide, a police officer, and a Tyson Foods lobbyist, again clearly targeting state or corporate actors.  I highlight the distinct character of left-wing terrorism because of how starkly it contrasts with right-wing and Islamic terrorism.  which consistently pursues either random violence towards civilians or violence targeted specifically at marginalized groups.  And I don't bring this up just to highlight the difference between left-wing terrorism and right-wing and Islamic terrorism.  but also to draw attention to how similar right-wing and Islamic terrorism are to one another, and how they're made distinct from left-wing terrorism by their targets and their methods.  Islamic terrorists throughout the US consistently attack civilians in public spaces, much like right-wing terrorists.  Both Islamic and right-wing terrorists most frequently have human targets and regularly attack marginalized groups.  They attack synagogues.  They attack gay bars.  In the West, right-wing terrorists attack mosques.  In the Middle East, ISIS attacks mosques.  While left-wing terrorists target companies, police, politicians, right-wing and Islamic terrorists are much more likely to target you.  There's a very simple reason that right-wing and Islamic terror have such a similar character and similar targets.  Islamic extremism is a far-right ideology.  Western media has gotten better at acknowledging the presence of right-wing white supremacist violence in recent years, but they still fall into the misstep of drawing a hard line between the white supremacist fascism of the white American right wing and the Wahhabist fascism that has been militarizing the right wing in the Gulf through groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda.  Both of these genocidal far-right ideologies are built around an identitarian supremacy, with the intention of violently imposing a brutally hierarchical social and cultural order at the expense of women and all marginalized groups deemed outside of the in-group that they have placed at the top of said hierarchy.  Take any jihadist and any neo-nazi and they're likely not to get along, but they effectively believe the same things.  Their versions of these ideas are colored somewhat by their cultural background, but whether it's Christian, secular, pagan, or Islamic, whether it's West or East, fascism is fascism.  Islam is no more accountable for ISIS than Christianity is for the KKK, and the efforts to highlight the different cultural backgrounds of these fascists with the intent to obfuscate their similarities must be opposed.  Fortunately, it is notoriously difficult for people who want to put their ethnic or cultural group at the top of the pyramid to cooperate with other groups with the same goal.  However, when we understand radical Islamic terror as driven by far-right politics, we get a much more accurate picture of what percentage of terrorism comes from the left as opposed to the right.  Not one act of terrorism accounted for in this report was perpetrated by Antifa.  Nearly all of them were perpetrated by people who antifascists are actively opposing.  As a result of the destructive character of right-wing terrorism, it has a much higher fatality rate than terrorism from the left, which, again, is the result of a much higher rate of actually aiming to kill people.  Though you'll notice right-wing terrorism has a higher fatality rate than Islamic right-wing terrorism, despite their similar character.  Why is that?  Well, as we touched on earlier, a lot of it comes down to policing.  48%, nearly half, of the Islamic terrorist incidents in this report involved sting operations of some sort, as opposed to 12% for other right-wing incidents and 11% for left-wing.  Greater investment in the prevention of Islamic terrorism resulted in twice as many Islamic terror plots being foiled compared to the number of right-wing plots that were foiled.  And there was an equal percentage of stings for left-wing and right-wing conspirators despite one being significantly deadlier than the other.  To quote Reveal's write-up on the report, Three-quarters of the Islamist incidents in the database were preempted plots, including elaborate sting operations, while 35% of far-right incidents were preempted, a much smaller ratio.  That disparity, counter-terror experts say, is an indication that far fewer investigative resources such as analysts, paid informants, and undercover operatives have been deployed to halt far-right attacks.  There's no short supply of cases in which the FBI does more harm than good as well, such as a sting that targeted 19-year-old Mohammed Osman Mohammed, about which an FBI agent assigned to the case wrote that Mohammed would not make any attempts to conduct a terrorist attack without specific direction from the undercover employees.  The report also notes that evidence was even introduced at trial that FBI operatives had blocked him from traveling to a cannery job in Alaska to keep him involved in the plot that they had designed.  The FBI even paid his rent while they manufactured this terror plot for him.  So I'm not here to endorse US anti-terror operations, but I think it's a safe assumption to make that if they invested as much into preventing white nationalist right-wing terrorism as they did Islamic right-wing terrorism, fewer people would have died overall.  I wonder what possible motivations could be behind their reluctance to do so.  Speaking of systemic racism, let's also take a look at the differences in how terrorists of different political ideologies and ethnicities are charged and sentenced.  First, of all the terrorist incidents that resulted in arrests, 91% of Islamic terror suspects faced federal prosecution, and every single left-wing suspect did as well, compared to only 60% of right-wing terror suspects.  leaving many of those cases in the hands of local and state authorities, which was likely a factor in the staggeringly low rate of terror charges actually being filed against right-wing terror suspects, at only 9%.  Compare that to 60% for left-wing terror suspects and 84% for Islamic terror suspects.  meaning nearly every Islamic terror suspect that was prosecuted faced terrorism charges, while hardly any did among the other right-wing suspects.  This hesitation to charge right-wing terrorists with, well, terrorism also contributed to a disparity in the harshness of sentences they faced.  Even though most Islamists were charged only in connection with plots, they often were sentenced as harshly as or more harshly than right-wing extremists, who mostly succeeded in committing acts of terror.  Among the Islamist cases, 8% got life sentences, 2% got death sentences and the average sentence for the other cases was 21 years in prison.  Among far-right cases, 12% got life sentences, 5% got death sentences and the average sentence for the rest was 8 years.  While there are some gross inconsistencies in the way we police different kinds of far-right terrorism, largely as a result of heavily racialized ideas about who is and is not a terrorist, the fact remains that the vast, vast majority of terrorism is the result of far-right fascist ideology.  And so we find ourselves returning to the claims from Fox News anchors and people like Ben Shapino.  as well as sadly the president himself that anti-fascists are just as bad as the fascists they oppose.  Or to hear some of them tell it even worse.  There are bad people on both sides after all.  The assertion that the people opposing the ideologies responsible for 90% of terrorist attacks in the United States are somehow the problem or the real terrorists.  It doesn't have any bearing in reality that we can find in this report, especially coming from people who have been mentioned as inspirations by white supremacist terrorists.  All over the globe, fascism threatens the safety of all human beings.  especially those in marginalized groups with the least ability to defend themselves.  That's why we need to defend ourselves, and each other.  If you oppose terrorism, if you get that same sick feeling every time there's a bombing or a mass shooting that I do, if you keep checking back for updated body counts even though it only upsets you more, join up with your local antifascists.  From America to the Middle East, they're the ones trying to stop the people responsible for 90% of terrorist acts.  From recruiting and orchestrating more killings, they're the ones trying to protect our communities, not these right-wing mouthpieces who try to deflect the blame every time they're quoted in another mass shooter's manifesto.  Only the people can protect the people.  Well, I'm going to tell you, fascists, you may be surprised.  People in this world are getting organized.  You're bound to lose.  You fascists are bound to lose.  All you fascists are bound to lose.  All you fascists are bound to lose.  Yes.  All you fascists are bound to lose.  You're bound to lose.  You fascists are bound to lose. ",
