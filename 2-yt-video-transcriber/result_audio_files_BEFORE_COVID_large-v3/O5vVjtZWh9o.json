            "text": "Greetings, this is Tyesha and today we are going to install my Holosun Red Dot Sight on my AR rifle.  This is a Sig Sauer M400.  This Red Dot Sight has the mounting brackets, an Allen wrench, the Holosun Red Dot itself with the riser, lens cloth.  and some extra screws.  Batteries are not included.  Details will be in the description.  Starting off, you unscrew the riser from the red dot sight itself and that's done by using the Allen wrench to remove the four screws.  Then the battery compartment is in the base of the red dot sight.  These batteries were so difficult to open.  I don't know why they do that.  That was the hardest part of the installation.  After you open up the waterproof casing, you just drop one of the batteries in there and it's up to, I believe, 50,000 hours of light.  Now before I reattach the riser to the base, I wanted to make sure I did not have a defective item.  So there you see, I have the dot in there.  So this is an operational unit.  Do not be like me and continue reassembly without putting your lens cover back on.  And there I am, I touched it!  Major no-no, make sure you protect your lenses at all times to avoid unnecessary scratches.  So here I am just attaching those little small screws to put the riser back onto the base.  Now, I did not say too much about this item initially, but this is Loctite Thread Locker.  And this is important for that screw to connect the entire unit to the Picatinny rail.  I got this at Lowe's.  There's two different types, the permanent and the removable.  I do intend to remove the screw, so you do not want to buy permanent.  When you go to apply the mount of the riser to the Picatinny rail, that's when you apply the thread locker onto the threads of the screw.  It takes about 10 minutes for it to set and about 24 hours to cure if I'm not mistaking.  But it does lock this in place so that the sight does not move around while the rifle is cycling when you're out shooting.  Because I was wearing makeup and I did not want to get makeup on my rifle, I just went ahead and just lightly, carefully placed my eye to it to make sure that it was on, it was placed right, and it fit perfectly in my shoulder.

            "text": "And I just finished installing my Holosun Red Dot.  on my 6 hour m400.  this was super easy to install.  i would say the most difficult part was cutting the batteries out of the pack.  i don't know why they put those in there like that but yes it was super easy.  i followed the instructions that was provided with the item And yeah, this was super cool.  I really wanted to install this myself because I want to become one with my rifle.  This was super easy, so now what I have to do is just continue adjusting it so that my sighting is corrected.  I'm so excited to get this to the range.  I did leave on my iron sights because let's say, for instance, my red dot just happened to go out.  I still have the iron sights.  I will definitely keep the Allen wrench tool that was provided in my range kit just in case I needed to take this off.  There's only one screw to take it off and you can continue on about your day.  I highly recommend that you pick up this Holosun Red Dot.  It's a great investment.  I know that they have a newer generation that's available.  I'll link that in the description as well as this one.  And yeah, I hope that you have fun at the range.
