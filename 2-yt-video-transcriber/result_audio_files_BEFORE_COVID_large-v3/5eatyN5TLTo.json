            "text": "Okay, so now I'm gonna show you how to make a green smoothie.  It's highly nutritious, so it's gonna help you fight depression and other mental health conditions.  But even more importantly, it alkalizes your bloodstream.  Now, if you wanna find out more about why it's important to have your blood at the right alkalinity, and why people like myself, we never get sick, ever, then you need to watch my video.  I think it's titled, Why I Never Get Sick.  The important thing to remember here is there's no specific ingredients you have to put in.  It's just basically gotta be green if possible, Green is chlorophyll.  It's energy from the sun.  It's what us as human beings thrive on.  Do you like my Lucky the Irish shirt, by the way?  It's green, huh?  So, if you're not sure what foods create acid in your blood, which you don't want, acid equals illness.  You want foods that create acid.  Alkalinity right alkalizing foods.  you need to just google it and get yourself a list off the internet.  Then you can pin it to the fridge and work on that.  So there's no particular order.  There's no portion size.  Just just use your common sense.  enough said.  So I found some celery in the fridge.  It was starting to.  You know turn so Before it gets thrown away in.  it goes Some ginger Good for the blood.  This is the stalk, oh, the stalk of broccoli.  Most people throw it away, which is ridiculous because it tastes more delicious than carrot, but you don't need to waste it anyway.  Found the last bit of a cucumber, highly alkalizing.  Bit of actual broccoli floret.  Now fruit, you see people making smoothies and it's like pineapple and mango.  That is no good for you folks.  Sugar, highly acidic in the bloodstream.  Would you like send your kid to the sugar bowl and tell them to take 30 spoons of that?  You wouldn't, right?  So why would you get them to eat, you know, like a mango or something which has got even more sugar in?  So don't put that in your smoothies.  What you can do is the stuff that has less sugar, like pear, for example, that will give the vegetables a bit of a nicer flavor.  And a bit of apple.  Again, not too much because there's a lot more sugar in this than you think.  But so long as you keep the balance right, it will still be alkalizing.  And the good thing about that is you can chuck in the apple core.  It's not gonna hurt.  Found some red cabbage that we haven't used.  That can go in.  And it's really important, obviously, to have some green leaf, hence the chlorophyll.  You can actually use a majority of a green leaf like kale or broccoli for your whole smoothie.  You know, you don't have to worry so much about these other ingredients.  The top tip is avocado will take away that vegetable-y, that kind of cabbage-y taste.  and it will make it creamier and taste smoother, right?  So chuck that in.  Then some lemon.  Lemon and lime are the only fruits that alkalize your blood.  Now, really, really good shortcut here, and that is super greens.  meal and I'll put as much of this in as I can get in in the container normally.  so sometimes like four or five scoops some water.  Hold your ears.  There we go, one green smoothie. ",
