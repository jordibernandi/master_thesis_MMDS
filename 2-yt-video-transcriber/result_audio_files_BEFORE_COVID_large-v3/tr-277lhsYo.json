            "text": "A while ago, a man named Dean Briggs came to me and said, if you were going to preach to 10,000 people, and you knew what you were preaching would loose the final great harvest, what would you preach on?  Instantly, tears welled up within me because God was touching me at the very core of my being.  And I said, I'd call a global, worldwide, 40-day Jesus fast because before there was ever an original Jesus movement, there was an original Jesus fast.  Before Jesus ever did a miracle, Before he ever preached the gospel, the Spirit of God drove him into the wilderness to fast, to overcome Satan and his temptations for internal victory so he could lose external authority over the demonic realm, the dark realm, to release salvation and deliverance to the world.  The Jesus fast has always produced the Jesus movement.  Out of the fast comes Jesus the evangelist, and the fasting man is the preparation for that great breakthrough.  thousands have just gathered to descend to be commissioned to go forth and preach the gospel.  i felt like it was like a jordan moment where jesus was anointed by the holy spirit to go.  but the first thing he did he was driven by the spirit into the wilderness to fast and pray for 40 days.  we're following the journey of the patterned son jesus christ.  On March 1st through April 9th, I am calling thousands around the world to join me on a 40-day Jesus fast.  I am going to be sharing with you daily devotionals.  I'm going to be giving you prayer targets to go after.  We're going to join together, suffer together.  Many people may not be able to fast March 1st through April 9th, but we're actually calling for seasons of extended fasting.  I want to encourage people to do fasts, very intense fasts, if you're able.  Water fast, juice fast.  It was like Jesus.  He did that and got major breakthrough.  But if you can't do a Daniel fast, We want to make sure that if you're going on a water fast or an intense juice fast, you would connect with a medical doctor and get sound advice and have covering because we want to make sure you're doing well.  But I've seen so many people do these fasts and they come out with breakthroughs.  I want you to believe for divine encounters with your life.  So join me on this fast.  And I believe it will be a historic moment, not just for you, Not just for America, but maybe the whole world. ",
