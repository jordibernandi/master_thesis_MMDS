All the headlines are saying now is things like, Three dead after white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.  Or, Charlottesville white nationalist rally blamed for three deaths, dozens of injuries.  With little mention of the other players in these events, and with little context at all, and misleading phrasing, the media appears to be trying to pin this on white supremacy, its favorite boogeyman.  Hell, even the term white nationalist has become almost as bad as saying nigger or kike, according to the leftists.  But blaming the alt-right, white nationalists, and white supremacists is just blatantly mischaracterizing the whole situation.  Right-wing conservatives decided to hold a rally which they called Unite the Right.  It's worth noting that they didn't call themselves Unite White Nationalists or Unite for White Supremacy.  Sure, they very likely contained some or many nationalists or supremacists, but the rally was established simply for conservatives who wanted to keep the statue. ",
