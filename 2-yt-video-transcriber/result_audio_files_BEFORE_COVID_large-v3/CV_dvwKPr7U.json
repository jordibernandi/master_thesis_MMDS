They're being able to pay, get their kids through college, put food on the table.  Where we disagree the most with the Marxist left.  is that the Marxists come after this and they will say it is inherently exploitation if someone is gaining wealth.  That is wrong.  That is fundamentally wrong.  If you buy a product, not only did someone have to make the product, but they have a job, they have a wage, they're able to provide them for themselves.  But if your product isn't good, people are not going to buy it.  If your product is worthless, people are not going to keep on buying it time and time again.  That is why things get better over time.  Capitalism does three things.  Makes prices go down, quality go up, and more people have more stuff.  That is why the poorest people in America are the richest people in the world. ",

Apparently my parents divorced.  They couldn't give me any money.  I was out on my own since I was 16 years old.  I'm doing pretty well right now.  You want to know what I did?  I didn't turn to the government.  I didn't cry.  I didn't say white man bad or orange man bad.  I got a job and I started working.  And I paid down my student loan. ",
