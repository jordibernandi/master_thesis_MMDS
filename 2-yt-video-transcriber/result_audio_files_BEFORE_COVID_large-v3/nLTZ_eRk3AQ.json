Shocking video shows officers pointing guns and yelling at the family outside the store.  One officer even threatened to shoot the girl's father in the face.  The four-year-old girl's mother, Aisha Harper, is heard saying she's unable to hold her hands up because she's holding a child and that she is pregnant.  On Monday, Aisha Harper and her fianc\u00e9, Drayvon Ames, spoke about what happened. ",

You know, 44 shootings and killings last year, 15 more this year, more than 60. substantiated complaints of brutality and excessive force.  But nothing as shocking as what we saw on this videotape with this family.  That was a complete failure to respect any of their rights.  You know, if you listen to the beginning of the tape, when the officers approach the car with guns drawn, they tell Drayvon to\u2014you know, one says, put your hands up.  The other one says, open the door.  Yeah, that's a perfect combination for an execution.  These officers were intent on violating this family.  Myers, the officer who was sort of the lead thug in this, has a terrible track record.  In fact, at the rally last night, a young man came forward to say that he has videotaped and shared it of Officer Meyer abusing him.  So, you have police with records of abuse that continue to be employed by the department.  Phoenix has the highest number of police on the Brady list than any other city, five times more police violence against people of color in Phoenix than cities of comparable size.  It's the fifth-largest city in America, larger than Philadelphia.  It's systemic and institutional, the violence, the racism.  The police department is 73 percent white, no diversity training, no sensitivity training, no body cameras.  no hope.  We must have something change.  And it takes advocacy and litigation, but intervention.

The mayor, her apology is lacking all substance and has been rejected by not only this family, but the entire community, especially the civil rights community.  She lied to the national media.  She said by August that all precincts in the city would have body cameras.  That's very misleading.  There's a difference between all precincts having a handful of cameras and all patrol officers having a body camera that they're required to use.  Who cares if a precinct has 15 cameras and 60 officers?  There were 10 officers that responded, including a lieutenant.  Not one had a body camera.  even though they came from a precinct that was a test precinct for body cameras in this city.  We have a police union that exercises tremendous control over the city council.  It's easier to fire the police chief or the city manager than it is to fire a rank-and-file officer.  Something is wrong\u2014policies, procedures, employment contracts.  That's what the city needs to look at.  But the mayor and the chief have seen fit to come to our community again and ask us Ask us for answers.  You know, we are\u2014after 44 shootings, 15 more just this year, umpteen rallies, marches, lawsuits, they know what we want.  The mayor represented South Phoenix District 8 for six years before she was elected mayor.  That's the highest concentration of black residents in the city.  She was estranged to us then, but she knows what we're demanding.  So, this is the politics of placation and smoke and mirrors, the finest we're seeing played on poor urban residents anywhere in the country.  And it's a shame, you know.  The police is\u2014the chief, she's a black woman, she said the other day that she gets how people feel.  I would hope so, but that doesn't mean she's doing anything about it.  Sometimes a black chief can be the best window dressing and prevention of bringing in needed reforms.  The proof is in the dead bodies and the broken bodies. ",
