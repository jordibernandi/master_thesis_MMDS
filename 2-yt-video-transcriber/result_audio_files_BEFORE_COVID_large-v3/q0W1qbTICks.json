            "text": "Okay.  So what will Trump's life be like once he leaves office?  Let's say he makes it to 2020.  My very, I think my very, very, very first reading was, is he going to run in 2020?  The answer was no.  And the Republicans are slowly turning away from him.  Like I said in the Bill Weld reading, they're getting behind other people.  Bill Weld being that person right now.  So the suggestion, I did a post on my page.  To navigate my page, for those who were curious, if you go to my channel, see if I can do it while I'm trying to tell you, if you go to my channel and click on my name or click on the Tarot's apprentice at the top, It'll say home, videos, playlist, community, channels, about, and then it has a little hourglass.  Click on the hourglass and you can type in, say for instance, Hope Hicks.  H-O-P-E Hicks.  H-I-C-K-S.  Hope Hicks.  And it should pull up if I ever did a reading on Hope Hicks.  And then it will be at the top.  And so if you ever want to know if I've done a reading on whoever.  Just go to my channel where it says about.  right next to it is the hourglass.  Click on the hourglass or the looking glass, not hourglass looking glass.  And it will search my channel.  I've done readings on a lot of people that get suggested for readings or subjects that have been suggested for readings.  It's just I post so many of them.  I don't even know how many videos I have.  So just go in there and see how many there are.  Because I've done some, I had a request to do Ivana Trump, do the mother.  I've done a couple on her.  So just go on there and see.  So what is this life going to be like?  Son of Wands.  It's the Knight of Wands.  I'm moving into a new field, actually.  So.  This is interesting.  What I get.  You have moving out, moving on from the White House, but the moment he does.  They begin to throw the daggers.  This is that when it all costs and then betrayal and then defeat and dishonor.  Now there is no honor among thieves, but I will call it dishonor anyway.  Notice the people in the background with the holes in their back.  She stabs them all.  And then she licks up the spoils.  So Donald Trump will be for the sake of argument.  Just allow me to use this work.  He will be victimized.  He will be the victim of the betrayal of his party or the party he represents.  He's not a Republican or Democrat.  He's just a Trump.  That's a completely different entity.  So he will suffer some betrayal.  The moment he moves on, the betrayal will come.  So that's how he starts.  Seven of Swords.  This is a sneaky and underhanded card.  Ace of Wands.  So the moment he leaves, there's some sneakiness and betrayal going on.  There's also a new plan of action.  So if... Oh.  I'm going to have to do a whole different reading on this card.  Let's just do a clarifier and see if we can simplify it.  Okay.  That's what I thought, though.  That's why I was wanting to do a reading on it.  okay so i'm not going to but maybe i don't know we'll see.  ace of wands new plan of action.  i thought to myself if he's thrown out and he reaches out for the mcconnells of the world and they say uh mr president we can't help you because you spent four years being a toad and then he turns the turtle face and say well you spend four years being you know and so they go through this whole thing.  and so i'm like okay maybe trump?  this is where i was when i was thinking that maybe trump would just throw everybody's business out there.  and then i get this all those people who stood with them stood behind him and mr president this and mr president that i told you.  he is loyal to no one other than himself.  he will throw every single last one of them.  he can under the bus Dare to stab him in the back, dare to make him play the victim.  He knows how to do that more than anyone.  So they're going to have a inter-party thing on their hand.  There is the inside man under the sneakiness and underhandedness.  So someone will be orchestrating maybe a takedown of Donald Trump from the other side.  That is sneaky.  So this is not overt.  So this is not McConnell coming out, dogging the president.  This is people who work on the Republican side who appear to be on the Democratic side.  Helping the Democrats, you know, get rid of Trump or smear him or whatever they're going to try to do.  But I said this in my Bill Weld video.  They are secretly pushing him out anyway because they're trying to change the image of their party.  They don't want to be the Trumpian party.  They want to go back to the R instead of the T. Or I'm a Trumpian from Maine.  No, I don't want to be a Republican from Maine or whatever.  Patience.  They're waiting.  Waiting for a time to strike.  In fear.  Goddess of Wands.  He fears the fire sign woman.  Right now, this is not necessarily Nancy Pelosi because this is after he leaves office.  Now, she can still do things after he leaves office if she's in office, mind you.  But he does fear a fire sign woman, so this could be a woman judge.  He hopes for preparation and plans.  in his environment is the victory card self-discipline triumph.  he's not going to be completely defenseless so there will be some some things that are going to go his way.  ace of pentacles money is one of them.  he knows some things and keep his mouth shut.  here's a couple dollars and he does have money for his defense because his base still loves him.  Oh, and by the way, polls and statistics are always made up, always made up to the best of their ability.  So don't go so much on.  how does he possibly have a 32% approval rating?  He doesn't.  They poll.  You'd look at the bottom where it says the polling information.  They poll like 100,000 people.  There are 300 million in the entire United States.  They didn't ask all of us.  They only asked 100,000 of us.  There's more than 100,000 people.  I say this in one apartment in New York City.  You did not possibly poll enough people to get the full scope of how America feels.  You just didn't.  You polled 100,000 people.  You basically polled one city.  somewhere in the 50 states and said this is how America feels.  no this is not how America feels.  period there.  he doesn't have a 32% approval rating.  he has a 32% approval rating among the people they asked.  that doesn't mean anything.  he has maybe a 10% approval rating if you polled everyone.  so there was a thing on the radio that said 78% of statistics are made up 50% of the time on the spot or something like that.  I think I just misquoted, but you get what I'm saying.  It's made up to fit the narrative.  That's basically the only reason they bring up.  his low approval rating is to fit the narrative.  Obama's numbers were fake, too.  So they just trying to fit the narrative.  That's all.  Word of warning.  Something new.  Anything new.  Don't get anything new.  Don't get a new hat.  Don't get a new scarf.  Don't get nothing new.  This is probably a new investigation of something, which is why you fear the fire sign woman.  So it's new.  something against you.  After you leave office, could be indictments.  Your word of solace is the king of cups.  I don't know who this is, but it always comes up for you.  There's got to be somebody in your background that helps you.  Because only Water Slime people I got, I think, are Mitch McConnell and Adam Schiff.  So neither one of those people are going to be instrumental in helping you after you leave office.  The Emperor.  This is my Putin card.  But I don't get a Pug energy from it, but there is an authority to that card.  That's your outcome.  They're trying to push you out.  but after you leave office you do find you some help.  believe it or not some very powerful people powerful men i should say that are behind you.  but once the investigations and the charges start dropping i think they will drop by the wayside as well.  this is why keeping calm during his transitions is just the best thing to do because our systems, our checks and our balances are too strong for Putin and Trump to take down in four years.  So rest easy, sleep well.  Donald Trump, even if he makes it, is still on his way out.  He will not be reelected.  Unless they cheat.  But they're just waiting for him to step one foot out that office.  And then Lord have all the mercy on his soul because they're going to indict the hell out of that man. ",
