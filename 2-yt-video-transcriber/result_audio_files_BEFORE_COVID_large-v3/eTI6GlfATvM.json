We addicted to business but don't invest in the children.  How we supposed to ascend it when we was ruled by the villains?  When the truth always hidden, how you supposed to be feeling?  How I'm spitting out wax when I ain't talking Brazilian?  How I got a small fortune and I ain't even make millions?  How a citizen's murder and private prisons make killings.  Country of broken families, pacified by the sentence.  Say if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willing.  Can't explain my dearness, I've been chasing the feeling.  Can't change it to wedges, so I'll always be chilling.  Lost a lot in my giving, to them I say good riddance.  I don't recognize all that's around me.  Jokers to the left of me, righteous clowning Ignorance splits, paraded so proudly Hard to see straight when my vision's so cloudy, cloudy, cloudy.  It's so bizarre.  It's so bizarre.  It's so bizarre.  It's so bizarre So bizarre!  I didn't ask for gifts!  Fuck your politics!  Jokers with the tricks, desecrate the crucifix!  Don't you know the game is rigged?  I've been dreaming since a kid, trying to get it how I live!  Now my outlook is grim, always ask how you is, never ask how you been!  Confessing my sins just to do it again!  Dealt with some friends, had to leave on a whim.  Can't pretend, gotta know if you went to the end.  I was born into this, sworn to abyss.  Word is born, forms in my head Scorn off the shit, too legit To a fish on the fritz, on a fence.  What it is, superstition, gotta hold up my vision.  Can I live?  I had no choice, well I gotta rejoice.  Even things I enjoy, got me kinda annoyed Man, I try to avoid, getting lost in the void.  Maybe I'm paranoid.  I don't recognize All that's around me, jokers to the left of me Righteous clowning, ignorance splits Paraded so proudly, hard to see straight When my vision's so cloudy, cloudy, cloudy So bizarre, so bizarre So bizarre, so bizarre So bizarre, so bizarre.  It's so bizarre.  I can't believe it. ",
