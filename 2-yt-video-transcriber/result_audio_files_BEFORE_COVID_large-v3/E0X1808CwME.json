But I think that's the plan of the white supremacists.  This is my opinion.  That what they're going to do, what they are in the process of doing now, They know that in the future, it's going to be a lot of what you call military conflicts going on everywhere.  I mean, where are you going to need soldiers?  So a lot of what we call the standard white person, the white male, the strong white male, what you call the best of the best.  what the white supremacists call the best of the best of white people, I mean, who are in what we call military situations, the best soldiers among white people, they predict, according to what I think in the system of white supremacy, that they're not going to have enough of them.  to cover all of these little battles going on, because they're just battles.  Battles are part of a war.  So we're already in a war, always have been.  So where there are non-white people and the white supremacists are sending white people off to die, you know, and sometimes in large numbers.  And all of these battles that are going to be coming up everywhere, all the time.  one little battle here one big battle there another small battle going over yonder and then one real close.  i mean that's a big battle again because you just had one three weeks ago.  now it's flaring up again.  you got to rush somebody there.  okay in the system of white supremacy.  so you have a lot of white people running all over the place trying to put out these fires in the system of white supremacy.  so Hey, enough already.  At a certain point, you've got to make a long-range plan, because this is going to be the pattern.  So here is a part of the plan, getting to the answer to the question.  I think we have a lot of very frustrated black females who are frustrated with everything, including black males, sick of them.  Because we are completely dysfunctional, not qualified to be husbands ever in the system of white supremacy or anything of any constructive value.  So they turn to each other, say, okay, I'll pretend that I'm the husband.  You pretend that you're the wife.  And since the white supremacists say that this is a great thing for us, I mean, let's do it.  Let's go all the way.  Let's form huge organizations.  where we just nurture each other.  We can do that because we have the best jobs and all like that, and among black people, the black female in the future is more qualified because we're not filling up the jails as fast as the black males are and all like that.  We kind of stick to business, try to do something that makes sense sometimes, all right?  But we just don't have a male.  I got all these college degrees and whatnot, and I'm looking around for somebody to share all this with me And I'm just sitting around a whole bunch of females just like me, and this is going to be the wave of the future because the white supremacists got it set up that way.  All right?  Black males are filling up the jails, sodomizing each other, and black females out here just trying to raise the babies on their own.  You never see a black female.  She's got seven of them.  Ain't no male nowhere around, okay?  That's going to continue because the white supremacists want it that way.  All right?  They got it set up that way.  So even the black males that want to do something can't.  See, that ain't going to happen.  Yes, sir.  Not under the system of white supremacy.  So the black females are going to be paired off with each other.  All right.  You got a tailor-made situation.  All right.  Girls, gals, come over here, both of you.  Or maybe... You know, in the future, three or four.  Since, you know, y'all not going to be producing no babies, so four of you can marry each other.  All right?  This just might be coming.  I don't know for sure.  But the white supremacists have a diabolical mind.  They're orchestrating all of this.  I mean, not some of it.  They are behind all of this stuff, okay, where black people are concerned.  But we don't know it.  But we will in the future, but it will be too late.  I mean, you know, hopefully not.  Okay.  So you say, okay, all four of you, you all married to each other.  All right.  Okay.  You love laying around in the bed with each other because you ain't got no real man, I mean, to do it with.  So you got all these sex toys and all like that.  So you got that down pat.  All right.  Come over here.  Now, I'm going to make it comfortable for you big time.  I'm going to give you all big bonuses to come into my army.  And you don't have to worry about going on leave and all like that.  I'll save a lot of money.  See, this is another thing, a big money angle here.  Look at all the oceans of money that they will save.  Because, see, soldiers, males and females, when they're separated, they like to get together.  And when they can't, it costs money and it takes time.  They want to go on what they call furloughs.  So you say, hey, you're always on furlough.  We'll make it real easy for you to lay around with each other in the barracks and all like that.  So you always got your mate right with you.  So we'll send you off to these... ",
