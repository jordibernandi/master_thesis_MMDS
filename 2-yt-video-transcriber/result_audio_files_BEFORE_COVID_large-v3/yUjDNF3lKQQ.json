            "text": "Thank you.  With what happened at Faithless Forum, I've decided it right to issue a public apology and condemnation of said acts.  When I made a video response to Stephen Woodford, an attendee and speaker at said event and my subsequent request video, I had no idea what would transpire.  Acts comparable to arson tore through the secular community, bringing pain and anguish to many.  So let me say it clearly.  I condemn what occurred, and I apologise.  Now since we're here talking about fictitious events which never occurred, I'd also like to apologise and condemn any part I played in The Fall of Man, Stealing Fire from the Gods, and the sinking of the lost city of Atlantis.  So yes, we've reached that stage where my critics are trying to silence me as a means to stop me defending not just trans rights, but myself in defending trans rights.  For those who don't know, I published a video on the Faithless Forum following the whole Woodford incident.  I'd seen similar situations in the eight years I'd been part of the secular YouTube community, and had concerns about what could potentially transpire at said event.  So I made two simple requests.  I asked people to keep an ear out for said claims that I fractured the atheist community, and, if they emerge, remind people of the truth of what happened.  And that was it.  Now, a big part of what I did was actually a preventative measure.  People are less likely to start shit if they know the person they're talking about might find out.  It pretty much acted as a reminder for people to watch what they say, and it seemed to have worked.  the topic only came up one time, as far as I'm aware, as a question for Woodford.  Now, according to my sources, he answered said question without even mentioning my name, so all was good.  So why am I making this video?  Well, I was on a livestream with Maddie from Objectively Subjective, talking about the state of the secular community, and I had my Twitter open at some point.  Now, after the show had ended, I opened that tab and saw that someone had included me in one of those suggestion lists.  You know, normal stuff, it's just rather typical.  But what stood out was a particular tweet by Telltale Atheist, which stated, quote, Indeed, join our community.  Although Essence the Tweet tried to start shit at our conference, so I'm not super happy about that.  Wouldn't recommend them.  Either way, lots of us  around.\".  Well, I wasn't about to ignore accusations levied against me, so I took a screenshot of said tweet and asked Telltale to defend their claims.  What followed were accusations about what my fans had apparently done at said event, but it was always kept vague, so I and others kept demanding to know what had happened, precisely.  reports only mention the single question, to which Telltale told us we'd have to wait for the conference video to come out, so clearly there's an active accusation going on.  Now, I'm not so sure about what took place after that, since they suddenly started changing tact.  They started claiming that it wasn't about what had happened, even though their original tweet and their tweet about the video implied differently, I got the feeling that maybe one of the attendees or organisers had told them that they're spouting shit and there's no way to dig themselves out of that.  So I just took it for what it is, an attempt to avoid being caught out on a lie.  So I and others pointed out the very active assertion that I attempted to start shit, to which Telltale responded that they'd done no such thing, only to gloss over the fact that they had when I inevitably reminded them of the original post that had started the whole damn thing.  At which point they offered no apology, they just wanted to turn conversation away from the fact that they'd been caught lying to trying to implement me in what hadn't occurred.  It reminds me a lot of far-right types grabbing any brown person they see on the street and demanding that they condemn 9-11.  It's not a genuine demand for condemnation, they're putting said person in a bad situation.  If they condemn it, that can be twisted to be a sort of apology from the right angle, implementing them in some way in what occurred.  If they don't, well, clearly that's to do with the fact that they agree with what happened.  Either way, they're fucked.  Now following all of this, Telltale switched tact once more and attempted to cosy up to me, asking for a private conversation, which I was not going to entertain, especially with shit like this.  Not only have their attacks and their lies shown them to be acting in bad faith, but they openly admitted to backpedalling, not because they were proven wrong, but because they wanted to shift the focus of the conversation away from said lies.  And that was it for them.  I have no intention of spending labour talking to someone who has demonstrated themselves to be acting in bad faith.  It reeks of fakeness, and I think that's by design.  They don't want a conversation, they want me to see the backpedaling comments because they know a reasonable person would cut off contact after that.  But they can still present that in the same fashion as theists present people refusing to waste time with them.  So again, no matter my response, I take flak for this.  But I feel I've defended myself well enough.  I've seen some people removing their support for Telltale, which is good.  It's good to see actual consequences for their actions.  But it wasn't just Telltale.  I had this lovely figure come and tell me that my defence of myself would now tarnish their opinion of trans people forever.  They went on to say that they've gone beyond simple transphobia, as a result of me defending myself over defending my rights.  as a trans person.  Again, it's more hard choices, and I could just brush this off as simple trolling, but it's not that.  This is manipulation designed to stifle criticism, both by Telltale and this jackass.  You need to know what happens to trans and other minority voices in the secular community.  This acts not only to justify the transphobia they started with, since, no, I don't buy the, I used to support you.  If you claim to have supported me, only to revoke said support when I act in self-defence, that's not actual support.  But it's also designed to disarm me.  Pretty much, they wanted to disable my defence response.  I can't defend myself without them revoking some allyship.  Which, by the way, Prue said allyship to be fucking false to begin with.  But they don't care about that.  All they care about is putting me back in my place.  I first discovered the label trans and the various sub-labels in 2011, at which point I started going through them to figure out which one described the sense of identity I had had since I was a young child.  And I kept that hidden for years, because I was too afraid to come out.  And as part of that, I couldn't defend my peers as much as I wished, and I have to live with that.  But I can tell you one thing.  I'm not going back there, and these attempts to stifle my voice can all get fucked.  I don't like what I'm doing, but it's necessary.  My rights are not up for debate.  Me defending myself over defending my rights is not up for debate.  This is a game for people like Telltale and just Friedel.  It's not for me.  I actually have something to lose from this emotionally draining conflict.  And it is emotionally draining.  I shared Telltale's tweet with a friend of mine, not realising that her child was a massive fan of him.  It feels shitty to know that I'm breaking a lot of heroes, and it got to the point where I actually broke down crying over this fact whilst talking to both Maddy and Godless Cranium.  I had to walk away for a couple of hours to calm down.  This work is not leaving me feeling good.  I don't do it because of positive reinforcement.  But it is necessary.  And I know that some people already see me as foreboding, so perhaps people's perceptions of me aren't exactly changing.  But this isn't something I do out of joy.  It's something I do out of desperation.  out of pure fury of the injustices being wrought.  And I'm damn tired of this culture of apathy.  I'd have once referred to it as the Cult of Apathy, but the word cult has been overused by every bloody tool under the sun so bloody often that the word has lost its bite.  but I'm still sick and tired of it.  This idea that I should either not speak out in protection of trans rights, my fucking rights as a trans person, or in defence of myself over possible occurrences, is just a symptom of that fucking apathy.  So as is hopefully made clear from this video, if they lack any actual reason to discredit you, they will invent something, and I'm questioning as to whether this is simply motivated by a sense of protectiveness surrounding a single conference, or whether it's an opportunistic attack used to try and poison my character in relation to recent discourse.  Nothing is simple anymore, and as Telltale has shown, his word on this can't be taken for shit.  I mean, Telltale was so protective of his conference that he attacked someone with a known history of documenting shitty behaviour and reporting back on it.  The fact that I'm making this video can't be a surprise, and surely someone of basic intelligence would realise that by forcing my hand on this, faithless form now becomes tied to libelous allegations.  Allegations which include comparing my actions in defending my rights as a trans person to the burning of kingdom halls and targeted harassment of women until they close their accounts.  When people search faithless form and future, this video will appear, and none of that can be a surprise to telltale atheists if they're half as smart as they pretend.  So what does that tell us about their motivations here?  But what do you lot think?  Are we coming to a tipping point in the secular community, or am I just being hopeful?  Did anything I say in my Woodford or subsequent Faithless Swarm video amount to starting shit?  Was Telltale fair in comparing my actions to the burning of Kingdom Halls and targeted harassment of women until they closed their accounts?  Did I miss something you lot noticed?
