            "text": "Fingers down my spine.  Girl, you're looking mighty fine.  Oh, won't you rub your fingers down my spine?  hello everyone and welcome to new sex toy review.  today's product is the male painless water bath.  electric penis pump vacuum erection enhancer.  sex toy by z sex.  do you like z sex?  yes you like z sex.  i love z sex.  anyway this is a penis pump that uses water.  Now, the pictures on the website seem to indicate that it creates some kind of whirlpool, but I haven't found that to be the case.  I mean, I can demonstrate.  Like, let me cover this.  So I'll turn it on.  Alright, turn it up all the way.  Alright, so I can put my hand over it.  I can feel it kind of sucking down.  Now, what the water does is it helps close the seal.  So it allows the suction to be more intense or more consistent.  But, like, there's never a whirlpool.  Like, ever.  So the whirlpool was fake news.  I'm very, very disappointed.  I was looking forward to a whirlpool sex toy.  You know, because, look, we've all been in the pool.  And we've seen the intake of the pool filter.  And we're like... I'm gonna fuck that pool intake.  We've all been there.  Let's not pretend.  This is the trust tree.  We're in a place of healing and understanding.  Let's not pretend we did not fuck the pool filter intake when we were sitting in the pool.  Anyway.  No, there's no whirlpool effect.  It's just a penis pump.  There is apparently a separate attachment which you could put a pocket pussy sleeve in this and use it like a fleshlight, but those are so cheap that it's kind of redundant.  You could just get a separate toy for the same price that comes with its own plastic sleeve instead of reusing this one.  So what you're really left with?  you have a a gasket where you put your penis in and it comes with two other gaskets of different widths.  the one that's on it by default is the widest one and there's a medium one and there's a small one.  they basically just have a slit at the bottom and you basically put your penis through there and it goes into the water and then you basically just now in order to get the the suction you have to turn it upside down so that the this is exposed.  so let me do that real quick.  hold on so some show i'm talking about.  let me turn it on all right.  so i'll turn i'll turn it upside down and you can well not really airtight.  the water helps create an airtight seal.  maybe my hand isn't doing the best job.  It's whatever, honestly.  It's whatever.  Honestly, though, like, okay.  So, like, real talk.  I've used penis pumps in the past.  I reviewed one, I don't know, a couple years ago.  They don't work.  They don't work.  Do they stretch your dick out?  Yes, they do stretch your dick out.  But it's very important that they stretch your flaccid dick out.  So let's say you're on the short side or whatever, you want to increase your width, your girth, your length.  These products will stretch your flaccid penis out longer than it normally would.  But the problem is it doesn't extend the length of your erection.  So you have a longer flaccid penis, but you don't have a longer erect penis.  So wait, that doesn't make any sense.  If you stretch out your flaccid penis, wouldn't your erect penis be longer too?  No.  When you get an erection after using one of these toys and stretching out your flaccid penis, all that additional length gets pulled back.  And you basically have this super girthy, like, thing.  It looks like a lion's mane.  Like, imagine the tip of your dick is like the head of a lion.  You can have this huge, girthy, swollen thing.  So, when you get an erection after using a penis pump, your penis pulls back.  And all that additional length becomes additional girth.  Now I have tested this in the past.  You can masturbate with this super thick soda can like penis.  It doesn't hurt.  You can ejaculate.  So if you have girth problems, like if you're super skinny, this could work.  You could stretch out your penis, get an erection, pull it back and increase your girth.  But unless you have a problem, unless, like, if girls are telling you all the time that your dick is too skinny and they can't feel it or something along those lines, this isn't going to give you permanent results.  It does not increase the length of your penis while having an erection.  It only increases the length of your penis when you are flaccid.  Now the water did feel nice.  I used this for about a minute just to see if it hurt.  It doesn't hurt, so when they say it's painless, They're not joking.  The water does help.  It helps it kind of feel more pleasant while it's literally pulling on your dick.  But that's all it is.  Essentially, all penis pumps are are a device that pulls on your dick to increase the length.  This is probably the painless, most pleasant feeling penis pump.  But I don't really recommend this unless you're a very specific group of men who would benefit from a penis pump.  Like if you have a tiny pencil dick and you need that additional girth.  Or, this is another one, let's say you're a male stripper.  And you got to take your clothes off, but you don't need to get an erection.  Like you want your flaccid penis to be as long as possible.  So when you do your little table dance, everyone can see how big your dick is.  A penis pump would be great for you because you're not getting an erection.  And it does increase the length of your flaccid penis.  So male strippers, guys with tiny pencil dicks.  That's about it.  If you're trying to actually increase the length of your penis, this doesn't do anything.  If you're trying to masturbate in some kind of whirlpool sex toy, this doesn't do that.  I'm very disappointed.  I really wanted a whirlpool sex toy, so I'm very disappointed about that.  But yeah, that's it.  For the price, I mean, this is... I mean, it's on sale right now for $65.  It's normally $90.  That is really expensive.  So those are my thoughts on the Z-Sex Painless Water Bath Electric Penis Pump.  Check it out if you're in the market for a penis pump.  I do have a 15% off coupon code in the description.  But anyway, thank you Z-Sex for sponsoring this video.  This is Turd Flinging Monkey.  Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time. ",
