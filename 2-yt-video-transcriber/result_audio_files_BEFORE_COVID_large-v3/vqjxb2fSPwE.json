Why do you think it is that so much of what you say is so very popular with the alt-right?  It isn't.  And you don't have any evidence for that at all.  Any more than the evidence that alt-right people watch this show.  Oh, well, that was all taken apart today by a number of Jewish publications, by the way, showing that, first of all, that was all satirical commentary on the part of the alt-right, directed at taking me down.  for example.  And there was an alt-right article yesterday published saying that I was a Jewish stooge and shill.  So this is absolute nonsense.  And I don't appeal primarily to the alt-right.  There's no evidence for that at all.  It's the proclivity of... I never said primarily, Jordan.  What I'm interested in is why you think that you get the reaction that you do from the alt-right.  Looking at, you know, the Cathy Newman documentary.  What reaction?  Interview.  There's 10 million people watched that and commented on it.  I'm talking about what I saw.  And I'm curious to know what your reaction was to the glee with which the alt-right seized upon.  I don't accept the concept that it was the alt-right that was doing this.  There were 10 million people who commented on that video, and about 95% of them commented negatively on Cathy Newman's behavior.  You think there's 10 million alt-right trolls watching that?  You think the hierarchy of the patriarchal system is a good one?  Well, first of all, I'm not convinced that the theory that what we have is a patriarchal hierarchy is correct to begin with.  I don't think that way because I don't understand precisely what that means.  Does that mean that women had no role in shaping our society?  It's only been the last 10 years that people have... made the presumption that it's self-evident that what we live in is a patriarchy.  What, women haven't contributed?  Is this the point we're making?  Is that women haven't contributed to our society?  They just weren't there until what, 1965?  And all of a sudden they took their place.  All the women before that weren't doing anything at all.  It was all patriarchy.  You don't feel that globally men have the better end of the stick?  No.  No, I don't believe that globally men have the better end of the stick.  I don't understand why people would even begin to conceptualize the world that way.  Better in what way?  Roles of power in businesses, politically, men pretty much rule the world.  No?  Well, what about in warfare?  What about in dangerous jobs?  Who gets killed in war?  Who fights in war?  You have women soldiers in the army nowadays.  It's opening more and more.  Is a woman soldier not as good as a man soldier?  I don't know whether a woman soldier is as good as a man soldier.  I know that in most armed forces women aren't placed in high combat frontline positions.  Who is responsible for this, the demasculization of the society?  Feminist groups have a fair bit to do with it, and the radical left types that insist that what we live in is a patriarchal tyranny.  What is the issue with feminists nowadays?  They think that the idea that our culture is a tyrannical patriarchy is an axiomatic truth.  Well, I think that's complete nonsense.  The insistence that sex, gender identity, and gender expression are social constructions.  The insistence upon that.  The insistence that if there are any differences in outcome, that's a consequence of oppression.  That's what's up with them.  All of that's complete bloody nonsense.  You have the feeling that feminism has gone too far?  Far too far.  But it's the leftist, it's not so much feminism, it's really the ideology that characterizes the radical left.  Feminism is part of that. ",

The biggest differences between men and women in the world in terms of temperament and interest are in Scandinavia.  And they've maximized as a consequence of your egalitarian policies.  What do you mean by that?  It means that the more egalitarian your state... the bigger the personality differences between men and women.  That's like the... How do you measure that?  How do you know that?  Oh, well, psychologists have perfected, at least to some degree, the measure of personality over the last 30 years with very advanced statistical models.

So for me, equality and gender equality is very, very important for me.  Also, when we talk about gender equality, It's important for me to learn my daughter that her mom can lead and show the way and her dad can hug and kiss her and show feelings.  And I think that's something very important for the family.  the hoods where kids grow up, to show feelings, to have these gender equality discussions, to show her a way of opportunities and to strive forward.

It's obviously of great utility to encourage forward striving in young people and people in general.  That's not the issue, in the least.  The issue is the outcome.  But why do you think... Yeah, well, why do you think the outcome, and these countries where the outcome is more equal, why do you think that leads to bigger differences?  Oh, because there's only two reasons that men and women differ.  One is cultural, and the other is biological.  And if you minimize the cultural differences, you maximize the biological differences.  So I know everyone's shocked when they hear this.  This isn't shocking news.  People have known this in the scientific community for at least 25 years.  And it's been replicated in the last month three times in three separate samples, including in Science, which is the world's greatest scientific magazine by a large margin.
