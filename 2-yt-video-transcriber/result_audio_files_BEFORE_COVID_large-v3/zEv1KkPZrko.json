So we have a traffic stop up here.  I guess this is in Peabody.  It's right near the Peabody-Salem line.  Got two cruisers.  You guys, if you don't live around here, might call that Peabody.  Here in Massachusetts, we call it Peabody.  Here on the North Shore, it's a really worn-out plate.  I haven't had too many runs with the puberty police yet.  17 out.  So I realized when I see the screen and it's jumping around, I think that's the screen stabilizer.  So that's why when I see the video, it doesn't jump around like that.  Nope, not Worldstar.  Sounds like they're gonna hoe it.  Right to here?  Why wouldn't they just let him drive it over there?  All right, no problem.  This is going to be all right.  How are you doing?  Good.  I'm stepping off the sidewalk because he has to back off.  So it sounds like they're gonna be stealing this guy's car and by the looks of it, that's exactly what they're doing.  I I'm not quite sure why, they're taking off it's plate back there.  Amen.  That elbow, kid.  That... Thank you.  Hey, your YouTube channel?  Yeah, I do cop watching, civil rights activism.  I don't go out busting their balls, as you see.  I don't yell anything to them.  I just try to make sure they respect our rights.  And if the people don't know their rights, I'll kind of let them know.  You know what I'm saying?  So, yeah, on the back is the Massachusetts state law for police identification.  They have to identify to us when we ask them.  Hey, how you doing?  Can I get your name and badge number real quick?  Donovan 608.  Thank you, sir.  Appreciate it.  Like that?  Just like that, no problem.  Someone will say no, and then I get their car number and everything, go file a complaint on them, because they broke the law.  You guys couldn't have let them drive it around the corner?  Oh man, that stinks.  Alright guys, so he had no insurance.  How close is he going to walk up to me?  it's called the cam back and that's how people get famous on youtube right there.  you know what that's called exercising your first amendment.  that's what that's called.  the difference is i didn't walk up to you like it like an asshole.  the other guy that's using vulgarity and you can get your face rearranged.  oh did you just threaten me on camera?  i You just threatened me on camera?  I just said you could get your face rearranged.  Oh, really?  That's correct.  For exercising my First Amendment?  Calling you an asshole?  I keep talking to you because you're a colonic cavity.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Hey, this gentleman just threatened me.  I got it on camera.  He just said he'd rearrange my face.  So he walked across the street to start trouble with me.  That's what I thought.  Oh, you could get your face rearranged doing that.  I didn't approach him.  Thank you, sir.  No, I appreciate it.  Hey, that's him.  He walked up to me.  You can ask him to move along.  That's me.  I'm not going to.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I know my rights.  I know my laws.  This guy doesn't.  Now they're showing them like God.  With that interaction, probably.  He'll be my thumbnail.  Wait, he doesn't work for Tedesco?  Where does he work?  Across the street.  SS Automotive?  Oh yeah, good.  Don't worry, I get thousands of views.  Don't worry about it.  I'll find out.  I'll find out.  Real American with a desecrated flag on your shirt.  That's great.  I don't pick for the puppets, brother.  I don't pick for the puppets.  Yeah, go ahead.  Think I lie.  That's just your perception of the world, because you must be a liar.  Yeah, sure.  You're not a liar, like you didn't threaten me, right?  Okay.  I got it on film, brother.  I got it on film.  Become the star of the show now.  I never threaten people.  Never.
