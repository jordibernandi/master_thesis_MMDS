            "text": "Thank you.  Hey, it's Tyesha and welcome back to my bathroom.  You're actually in my medicine cabinet right now.  I got this video that was highly requested on my video that has over 200,000 views, my one year of day on when I shaved my head, but I'm now entering into my third year.  Can you believe it?  So one of the most popular questions is what have you used to grow back your hair?  Of course, I wasted so much money buying the latest and greatest, the newest this, the sheepskin oil, scalp oil, this, this, that.  But what I've done lately is I've kept it simple, kept it simple.  So I have about 10 minutes to do my hair.  So I want to show you some things and I'm actually show you how I do my hair.  I went to bed last night purposely not setting my hair so you can see what I use in my hair to kind of style it.  and move on and we'll do this really really quick.  so thank you so much for watching.  let's go ahead and subscribe like share.  check out my other videos.  uh my one year anniversary shaving my hair my two year all that good stuff actually is out in my natural hair journey playlist which should pop up right there.  so let's get into this.  so underneath this bonnet.  now don't laugh at me.  okay there it is.  that's what's under my bonnet.  This is my hair.  It is now 2020.  And yes, you might see right here I don't have any makeup because when I put my hair down, I don't put makeup on my five hair.  Yeah, I got a five hair.  I got five on it.  This is how my hair is when I don't set it.  I have 4C hair to the fifth power and I love it.  So I'm going to just do a simple like bang style with a puff.  I'm going to show you exactly what I use in my hair and this is what I've used to keep it simple and help it grow.  Starting out, I am using this spray bottle.  And in this spray bottle, I have... aloe juice and it's like one part aloe juice.  one part stay soft road and another part water.  and i have it in this spray bottle and this is what i use.  i moisturize my hair on the daily.  okay my hair stays dry especially up here in this season.  right now i'd be in winter.  this will just bring your hair to life.  okay Absolutely love it.  With the gallon of aloe juice, not only do I put it in my hair, but I also drink it.  I buy that gallon and I use one portion for drinking and another portion for my hair, okay?  Because I believe that anything, well, I won't say you should be able to eat everything you put on your body, but kind of, sort of, you should because you're just bypassing your mouth and getting stuff into your bloodstream.  So I try to stay as simple as As possible.  Okay.  Yes, I'm just going to separate this area here and the rest of us will go back in to a Like, you know bang like area.  now the next thing I use on my hair just to make it grow and I keep it simple is Hair grease.  blue magic hair grease.  my mother my grandmother and I know that my great-grandmother used this that Queen bergamot or that red cap that red jar hair grease brought up grease.  keep it simple.  okay keep it simple.  the market is saturated with all types of products.  if you divide this that promises this and if you do this then they put models on the advertisement with hair weave.  you can't you don't know who to trust.  keep it simple okay i'm gonna trip you out with this one.  okay um not only do i use hair grease so Take a breath.  So with my hair grease, sometimes I'll take a portion of my hair grease and I'll make a mixture and I will put some MTG growth.  I don't have the actual bottle because one bottle will last you forever.  But let me warn you, it's meant for horses, but it smells horrible.  absolutely horrible.  it smells like ashtrays and bacon.  okay ashtrays and bacon grease but it grows the shit out your hair.  okay my mom put that in my hair.  funny story.  my mom put that in my hair with some sulfur eight grease when i was a little girl and i went to school and the classroom was real hot.  so my hair was just radiating the smell.  so my teacher was walking around.  what is that smell?  so she's walking up the rolls as we're doing our test.  she stops at me and does a that's you.  why do you smell like that?  and i was so embarrassed.  so i went home and i told my mom my mom had wrote a note the next day.  like that is hair medicine.  uh you need to apologize to my child before i come up there.  so i got an apology the next day.  funny story.  that was the fifth grade.  yes i'll take some of the mtg growth with a portion of hair grease.  mix that up and i will grease my scalp with it also.  uh sometimes what i use is just plain old castor oil.  Yeah, plain old castor oil.  I got this at Walmart.  You can find castor oil at Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Revco.  Isn't that Revco?  My granddaddy used to work there, RIP.  But you would just put that in your scalp and what that does is thicken up your strands.  I know that Jamaican black castor oil is the big fad right now.  But instead of paying a million dollars for Jamaican black casserole, just go buy you some castor oil.  You will find this in the laxatives aisle, okay?  Also, I'm going to Dollar Tree and pick up this softy grease.  Actually, it's not a lot of castor oil in this.  It's petrolatum and castor oil is the second ingredient.  So when I run out of this softy grease too, I use the Indian hip, the castor oil.  And what I do is I'll take a little bit of this and I'll just make my own like scalp grease.  Uh-oh, castor oil, castor oil, grease, sulfur, yeah, some sulfur.  You can use sulfur, too.  That will grow the shit out your hair, okay?  You can also use some, like I said, the MTG growth.  Put a little bit in there.  I will warn you, if you have a significant other, a spouse, someone you go to bed with, Before you use the NTG growth, you may want to give them a warning, okay?  Or you may want to put that in your scalp and go out about your day, okay?  Because when you hit that pillow, and if they like to smell your hair and smell all the juices and berries in your scalp, they ain't going to get it on that night, okay?  And they might be repulsed by you.  Take some of my Blue Magic hair grease, and I just grease my scalp.  My grandmother, she would pin curl her hair every night.  And just take some, massage it in your scalp.  Now this is after I've put some moisture on it.  You know, go ahead and do that.  And I will continue this across my scalp, okay?  All right, now that that is all done, I have greased my entire scalp.  You wanna give yourself a massage for a little bit.  If I didn't have somewhere to go, I will be on my yoga bench, kind of, I do that every day, just kind of invert for a little while to get the blood flowing to my scalp because your scalp needs to eat.  So you wanna supply it with blood.  Next, what I'm going to do is before my timer goes off, I get my Afro pick.  Take my Afro pick, get my hair going to where I want it.  I'm going to pick it out.  My favorite is this hair gel.  I found this at Sally's Beauty Supply.  I first got hooked on it when I was in Georgia.  Love this.  This is Biotin Infusion Styling Gel and I use this all over.  I have been using this Edge Booster.  I hate this stuff.  This stuff does not work.  Yeah, I'll do another video on that.  I don't like that stuff.  It's just heavily scented and social media done.  hyped that gel up, okay?  this gel on.  okay i want to hit that kitchen real quick.  hit them edges okay.  my all-time favorite of mine is murray's black beeswax.  i love this stuff for my edges.  shout out to a channel.  a youtuber turtle loves beauty.  she put me on to this.  so hey turtle love you girl.  um I'll leave a link for her channel there too.  She has some great makeup and stuff on her channel.  I use that on the edges and also to secure the kitchen.  All right.  And while I'm doing this, I want to also mention that I also, damn, I hurt my elbow.  I mentioned.  I also take biotin, okay?  Biotin every day, plenty of water.  I will leave a link for some biotin.  I got that at GNC, okay?  All right, so now that I have, I went ahead and tapped this out a little bit more.  My sister put me onto this 24-hour edge tamer.  Shout out to Shauna, my sister, put me onto this.  And I'm just going to put that on around my hair.  Most YouTubers at this point in time, they would tie down their hair with a scarf and then they'll come back.  But I got time for all that.  I got something to do, somewhere to be, some people to meet.  So we're not going to do all that.  So yeah.  I'm just grateful that I still have edges, got my natural edges and my eyebrows, you know, like if you still have your edges and eyebrows.  Okay, so this here is a puff, puff comb.  Well, what's it called?  Puff ringlet, okay?  I'll leave a link for that in description.  Someone has sent me this in a gift basket.  I think they got it at like a beauty supply store.  So shout out to them, that was really kind.  I forgot who sent it, but I am really thankful.  And instead of using the elastic band that just gives you headaches and your puff just hurts so damn bad all day and pulls on your edges.  so then you won't be part of the Edis and Eyebrows Club, this little ringlet is like a banana clip that you put on.  So, I haven't perfected it yet, but this is how it looks.  And you just open it up, fluff out my puff, And I really like this because, you know, I'm not at ponytail puff stage yet.  I may have to fake it until I make it.  But until then, I got my puff.  Help my son say, Mommy, get some waves.  I got some waves.  Then from there, I am going to just fluff out this part.  Because like I said, you know, I'm kind of self-conscious about my five hair.  I got five on it.  And then just fluff this out.  Because what I love about natural, my natural hair, is that it doesn't have to be perfect.  As long as it's big, it has volume, I love it.  So yes, in this video we talked about some things I've used to grow my hair.  Also before I let you go, I am going to show you just some things that I've picked up.  One thing that I want to tell you, also too, I'm still using, I'm still using my Extreme Growth Yogurt by Ray Solutions.  That video pop up right there.  But also too, what I failed to mention, I have this coconut, this Vatica coconut hair oil.  I use that, I mix it up in like my hair grow, hair grease kit.  Also I have this, I bought this at an Indian shop.  Pretty good, it smells great.  But one thing that people don't tell you they use for hair growth, okay, and I actually use it, I'm not ashamed of it, is monistat, okay, monistat.  The active ingredient in monistat is a seed that's in like Rogaine and stuff.  I don't use this all the time, but I just put a little bit in there, put it in my scalp as well, and yeah, there you go, you get your hair growth.  So yes, if you watch this to the end, you watch this tip.  Okay, you guys go to Walmart, get the seven day, seven day coochie cream and put it in your hair.  And that's how I grow my hair.  Thank you so much for watching.  This is it.  That's all I do.  I keep it simple.  I keep it simple and just feed, feed your body, water, vitamins, and put just simple ingredients in there.  And that's it.  Thank you so much for watching.  Check out my other videos and I will see you on the next video. ",
