Uh, if you like this kind of dumb fuckin' flurf shit, then please stay tuned!  Okay, so this very first part here is coming from an old show.

And I say that it's imaginary force because it's not actually a force necessarily.  Your relative position here on the face of the Earth is a product of the forces acting upon you.  So for one thing, you have Earth's gravity, which acts on you with a very specific force.  Amount of force, 9.8 meters per second squared is the acceleration.  Now, the centrifugal force pushes out by way, way less.  Like, the gravitational force of the Earth far exceeds the centrifugal force that we feel.  So, that's why we stay on the Earth, and that's what this teacher is actually talking about.  But you want to make it out to be like it's some mysterious force out in the universe.  Woooo!  That is pulling us off the Earth, and that's not what happens. ",

Now, due to the crushing pressure of gravity at the center of the Earth, it actually prevents this iron core from becoming a liquid and remains a solid.  Now, in the outer core, what you have is varying layers of different metals.  And these metals are rotating around with the Earth's rotation.  This, in turn, creates an electrical current, which creates our magnetic field.  So, it's not that the core is magnetic.  It's that the core creates an electrical current because of the spinning liquid metal at the center of the Earth that then creates the magnetic field. ",

So we would essentially float off into space or whatever.  That's the actual question that he's asking here, but he wants to make it out to be more magical than it actually is.  I think explaining the centrifugal force to him, or even the centripetal force, would be way too over his head, and he would just consider it to be scientific nonsense programming propaganda. ",

When in actuality, their understanding of the second law of thermodynamics is flawed because they do not factor in the effect of gravity in this situation.  If you actually use the GLOBE model and you factor in gravity, it is easy to see how the Earth can retain an atmosphere because of gravity.  But it's essential for their particular model or their particular presentation to say that it's impossible for the Earth's atmosphere to exist next to a vacuum, even though vacuums don't actually suck.

The other answer to his question is that gravity is what holds us onto the Earth because mass attracts mass.  We are held against the Earth by gravity.  If gravity wasn't here, we would most definitely fly off of the Earth, regardless of whether or not it rotates.  Thank you, heathens, for stopping by and watching me rant against Dean Marvel here.
