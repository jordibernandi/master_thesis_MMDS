And as always happens when Tulsi Gabbard appears on any corporate media network, Vazogian brought up Tulsi's 2017 trip with Dennis Kucinich to Syria, where she ended up meeting with the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.  So let's watch this clip.  Please pay attention to how disingenuous Vizogian is.  Please pay attention to how many times she interrupts Tulsi Gabbard and doesn't let her make the point.  It happens repeatedly.  And just let's listen to this.  And I'll get my thoughts about halfway through. ",

And the thing that makes Tulsi Gabbard different is that she actually has seen the cost of war firsthand.  When corporate media hacks like Vazogian try to attack her and make her look like a traitor, as the corporate media always does to any peace candidate of any party whenever they embrace a peaceful foreign policy, when Vazogian tried to do that with Gabbard, she just exposed herself for the deceptive liar that she is.  Vazogian doesn't know what it's like to serve, as Gabbard has, and she hasn't put her life on the line serving this nation like Tulsi Gabbard has.  So when all of these actual traitors in the corporate media, the traitors to peace and the traitors to humanity, when they try to paint Tulsi Gabbard in that light, they only expose themselves more.  This is what makes Tulsi Gabbard different.  She's not just on the correct side philosophically.  She's not just beautiful and well-spoken.  She's also actually served this nation and has the credentials to speak about issues of war and peace more than any of the disgraceful, disingenuous corporate stooges who try to attack her.  What this clip shows is that Tulsi is really invincible to these smears.  And beyond that, her message has broad appeal.  A peace message is the one thing that liberals, conservatives, progressives, libertarians, socialists, and yes, even centrists can rally behind.  Peace is the one nonpartisan issue.  And that's why the military industrial complex media is now panicking and trying over and over again to smear Tulsi Gabbard any way possible.  Because if she starts connecting with enough Americans, that puts a lot of money at risk for the merchants of death. ",
