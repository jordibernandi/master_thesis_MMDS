            "text": "Hello, this is Tony Haller from realclimatescience.com, setting the record straight about climate.  This video is titled, Precisely as Scientists Predicted.  I saw this tweet this morning from a Colorado public radio reporter.  I leave for two weeks in this.  Colorado State snowpack 539% of normal.  Southwest massive 1093% of normal.  It's been an unbelievable winter in Colorado with some record-breaking snowfall leading to resorts staying open well into June and also producing historic avalanche conditions.  It has been an incredible winter here in Colorado, and it isn't over yet.  It was cold here yesterday.  Now let's look at what the experts predicted.  This article appeared in the Denver Post six months ago.  Climate change clobbers Colorado and the West, unfurling fire, drought, insects, and heat.  As U.S.  government steps out, Colorado scientists and Governor-elect Jared Polis aim to aid adaptation scramble.  They were using the standard climate alarmist tactic of blaming the weather they don't like on President Trump.  And then the article went on.  Shrinking rocky mountain snowpack is forcing farmers out of business, jeopardizing skiing.  These impacts of global warming intensifying across Colorado and the West with costs in billions have happened precisely as scientists have been predicting.  Whatever the weather is, they always say it's precisely as scientists predicted.  Well, there was one dry winter last year, but generally this decade has been really good for skiing in the West.  In fact, California's three best ski seasons were 2011, this year, and two years ago.  They'll be skiing in California well into August.  New Mexico also has record snowpack, as does much of the Rocky Mountains.  The Denver Post is engaged in the usual climate ambulance chasing.  On the other hand, maybe they were right.  Perhaps Governor Polis and Colorado climate scientists fixed the climate, just like President Obama did in 2008.  Now let's look at another prediction.  In June of 1988, NASA's James Hansen appeared before Congress and started the modern global warming scare.  He predicted long hot summers and heat and drought for the Midwest.  Let's see how he did.  Well, the percent of hot days in the Midwest has plummeted since the 19th century.  This graph shows the percent of days over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, 32 C, at all 191 Midwest U.S.  climatology network stations.  The frequency of hot days is down more than 50% since the 19th century, and they peaked in the 1930s.  Same story with 100-degree days.  They used to be much more common in the Midwest part in 1940.  And with 110-degree days, that's even more dramatic.  There haven't been any 110-degree days in the Midwest in the last 60 years, but they used to be relatively common.  That's 43 degrees centigrade.  Dr.  Hansen said the increase in the number of hot days was going to be due to an increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.  But the data shows the exact opposite.  As carbon dioxide has increased from 300 parts per million up to 400 parts per million, the frequency of hot days has plummeted in the Midwest.  And it's the same story for the entire United States.  Over the past century, the frequency of hot days has plummeted.  They peaked in the 1930s, 1950s.  The last really hot weather we had was back in the 1980s.  On this date in 1933, most of the eastern two-thirds of the United States was over 90 degrees, and a huge swath was over 100 degrees, shown in purple.  Minnesota is very cool today, but on this date in 1933, it was 106 degrees.  The same story on June 10, 1911.  The eastern half of the country was extremely hot with a lot of 100 degree weather extending well up into the upper Midwest.  This graph shows the percent of U.S.  historical climatology network stations above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, 32 C, on June 10.  The five hottest June 10s all occurred more than 60 years ago, with the two hottest being 1933 and 1911.  Since about 1955, we just haven't had much hot weather this time of year.  Climate scientists and journalists have no idea what they're talking about and they consistently get all their predictions and their hysteria wrong.  But they have the same primitive mentality which people had in the 16th century when 15,000 witches were burned at the stake for cooking at the weather.  They always have to blame weather they don't like on somebody else.  In the 16th century, they blamed witches for bad weather, but now they blame President Trump, Republicans, and skeptics like myself.  I've been doing this climate blogging for well over ten years, and many times I feel like I'm living in a Monty Python sketch.  We have found the witch, may we burn her? ",
