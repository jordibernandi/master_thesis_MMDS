Hey I'm Fight the Flattery and welcome back to the channel that had a little chat with stupidity earlier today.  On an unrelated note, does anybody know the best way to get blood out of a carpet?  one of the worst things about these moronic mouth breathers is that they just flat out reject all evidence even when they're the ones that end up presenting evidence that goes against their stupid views.  we all know the earth is spinning.  we all know that's why there's night and day.  we all know that flat earthers are the stupidest idiots on the planet and that's why i have to explain the simple shit to them that really shouldn't need explaining.  so here we go.  i'll explain something everyone knows because a few idiots are so ignorant that they need all the help they can get.  We're living on a disk, floating through space, with a tiny sun.  Mind the planet!  Mind the planet!  Mind!  First up before we get started, I recently had a hangout about this very topic on the channel The Incredibly Funny and Smart Geostriver.  It's a few hours long but you get to hear Geo, me and Team Skeptic wreck JISM's newest video.  If I remember there should be a link or something up there and I'll put one in the description.  But for now, let's see what Dave from deep inside the rabbit hole has to say.  Well we're off to a bad start as he instantly makes a fool of himself by putting a factually incorrect statement on the screen and showing Earth as a tennis ball spinning about 200 RPM.  This is going to be rough isn't it?  Say, no, just no.  We don't have beliefs.  We have facts.  We have data that leads us to conclusions.  We have the scientific method, you know, the real one, not the one quantum erasure has spread around.  We have peer review and thousands of years of collected knowledge.  We don't have beliefs.  We don't need to believe in the heliocentric Earth model because we know it's right because we are not idiots.  And is the dramatic music really necessary?  Okay, two things.  One, 1,000 miles per hour technically, but compared to what?  The vacuum of space where there is no friction?  And the other thing is that the speed of sound is relative.  761 miles per hour is the speed of sound in our atmosphere, but the speed of sound in water that's about 20 degrees Celsius, 3,351 miles an hour.  So you can put these numbers on screen and act all incredulous, but without actually giving reference frames to these things, they mean nothing.  yeah and that's what we expect to happen.  the water is like that because it's spinning with us and there's an accelerating downward force of 9.8 meters per second squared on each and every water molecule in that lake.  because gravity is a thing.  and again that tennis ball is spinning way faster than our 0.000694 rpm of the planet.  And now you're using words like Mac.  Like it's a scary word and means something important.  No.  It's just the measure of speed of sound in a particular medium.  So 1,717 miles an hour is Mach 1 in our atmosphere.  Or 3,351 miles an hour is Mach 1 in water.  Do science-y sounding words intimidate you?  Yes, let's put it in perspective.  The Earth is spinning once every 24 hours.  The Earth is orbiting our closest star once every 365 days.  It's not very fast if you use your brain.  Yes, those things were fast in comparison to our atmosphere.  And back in reality, we're all laughing at how simple-minded you are.  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  It does speed up and slow down.  At its fastest, it's moving when it's closest to the sun.  It's going about 30.29 kilometers a second.  At its slowest, it's moving 29.29 kilometers a second.  That's a difference of one kilometers a second.  that happens over a six-month period.  Thank you.  Yes, we do have that, but you describing the Earth as moving at Mach 88 isn't right at all, as it's not possible to be doing Mach 88 in our atmosphere with the thing that's holding the atmosphere on.  You do realize how fucking stupid you are, right?  I mean, what if some of your family saw this?  No, no, just stop it.  You're not using Mach right.  That word doesn't mean what you think it means.  Do we have to?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Well, that's just not true, is it?  The stars do change, just not really in the span of human life.  And no, that's not convenient.  It's just a fact.  No, but I wouldn't if I were you.  I tried to warn you, now everyone's laughing at you.  Aww.  Well, there's a blue carpet here because I'm in my front room.  Yeah?  yes yes no no dave dave just no no dave just just no no.  So that's the model you're going with, is it Dave?  The one where light just arbitrarily stops at like halfway across and where the sun and moon are always 180 degrees from each other?  Come on, man.  So I'll tell you what, I'm going to give you five things that are positive evidence for the fact that our Earth does indeed spin.  But first, I need to say thank you to some people.  I want to say a massive thank you to all my patrons.  Your support allows me time to focus on my channel and do what's important, bringing you great content and fighting the flat earth.  I want to say an extra massive thank you to my $200 patrons, Christopher Kane and Jeffrey Sloan.  If you'd like to join and become part of the FTFE team, go to patreon.com forward slash FTFE.  And thank you.  The stars are a big problem for flat earth.  In the northern hemisphere, each night, we see the stars rotate anti-clockwise around a single point in the sky, the north star, Polaris, showing that the axis of rotation of our planet is in alignment with that star.  But that's not the biggest problem for the flat earth.  The biggest problem is that as we cross the equator and head into the southern hemisphere, we find out that Polaris has disappeared beyond the horizon.  And now we have a new center of rotation, a second circumpolar star where the stars appear to rotate clockwise around it.  The only explanation possible is that we live on a sphere that is spinning, you know, or magic.  The Coriolis force is a thing whether you accept it or not.  It's a thing and there are many ways of proving it, including but not limited to mass flow meters that literally use the Coriolis force to measure the mass flow and density of fluids, trade winds in the northern hemisphere being created by the deflection of pressure systems due to the Coriolis effect, and even the fact that army manuals have charts for adjusting for the spin of the earth.  The Etvos effect.  In the early 1900s, a German team from the Institute of Geodesy in Potsdam carried out gravity measurements on moving ships in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.  While studying their results, the Hungarian nobleman and physicist Baron Ronald von Etvos noticed that the readings were lower when the boat moved eastwards and higher when it moved westwards.  He identified this as primarily a consequence of the rotation of the Earth.  In 1908, new measurements were made in the Black Sea on two ships, one moving eastward and one moving westward, and the results substantiated Etfos' claim.  Pendulums.  In 1851, Jean-Bernard Leon Foucault showed that the plane of oscillation of a pendulum like gyroscope tends to stay constant regardless of the motion of the pivot, and that this could be used to demonstrate the rotation of Earth.  He suspended a pendulum free to swing in two dimensions from the dome of the Pantheon in Paris.  The length of the chord was 67 meters.  Once the pendulum was set in motion, the plane of the swing was observed to process or rotate 360 degrees clockwise in about 32 hours.  This was the first demonstration of the Earth's rotation that didn't depend on celestial observations.  And my number one evidence for the rotation of the earth is the precision gyroscope.  But I thought it best we let Bob Nadell explain this one. ",

            "text": "Recently, we've carried out an experiment to test the rotation to the earth.  If the earth is spinning at one rotation every 24 hours, that means that every hour it has to turn 15 degrees.  And if the gyroscope is mounted anywhere on earth, it's going to drift.  In today's 21st century navigation systems, they're using what's called a ring laser gyroscope.  It is extremely precise.  If we could simply get one of these ring laser gyroscopes, we would be able to prove once and for all that there is no rotation to the earth.  One of the people in the community actually purchased one for $20,000.  But what we found is, is when we turned on that gyroscope, we found that we were picking up a drift.  a 15 degree per hour drift.  Now, obviously we were taken aback by that.  Wow, that's kind of a problem, right? ",
