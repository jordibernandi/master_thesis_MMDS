            "text": "Hello.  Did someone say they were infertile?  they call infertility the silent disease.  but i want to talk about it because i have good news.  my wife and i were infertile for ten years ten years of failure and disappointment and bitterness and jealousy and confusion and anger and desperation and concealment and questioning our marriage and doubting god and putting on a happy face the silent disease.  that's not the good news.  these guys tried to help.  nope my wife and i were left like that woman in the bible who had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse.  and that's not the good news either.  but that woman touched on something didn't she?  well after ten years of praying i touched on something too and that's the good news.  I received an idea.  Dunk your balls in dimethyl sulfoxide.  Dunk them well.  Really saturate your balls with dimethyl sulfoxide.  Well, that made sense to me, so I did it.  If I were a woman, I would probably have received the idea to paint dimethyl sulfoxide on my pelvis, over top of my ovaries and uterus.  Right around there, I imagine.  I don't know.  I'm not a girl.  Skipping ahead, this is me and my wife and our two daughters.  Yes, they got their mother's looks.  Now, as far as I know, and I have had a physician friend help me to search the medical literature, and as far as we know, this idea and method is original with me.  So it's up to me to get it out, and that's why I wrote this book, A Little Life in You Yet.  How I Beat Ten Years of Infertility for $20.  And it is available now on Amazon, in paperback, and in Kindle.  For a moment, I thought about selling this idea, or selling the treatment, patenting it, and milking it.  But that didn't seem very Christian, because, as the book says, freely ye have received, freely give.  So I'm shouting it out, Paint your balls with dimethyl sulfoxide.  Or... Paint your pelvis and ovaries with dimethyl sulfoxide.  So there you go.  Now you don't even have to buy my dumb book.  But if you have more questions... Why did this crazy idea make sense to you?  how do you think it works?  liquid or gel?  how exactly did you apply it?  how soon did you see results?  how safe is dimethyl sulfoxide?  is this even legal?  buy my book.  it'll tell you all that and more.  if you still have questions email me.  i will help you if i can listen if you're infertile If these guys can't seem to help you, buddy or honey, you're just where I was.  I can't promise that my technique will help you.  All I can tell you is it worked for my wife and me with perfect effectiveness.  So I don't give advice.  But let's just say I didn't write this book to advise myself.  And if you're not infertile, you know a couple that is.  Buy my book, read it for yourself, and give it to that couple.  Be a blessing to them.  Maybe they'll name a child after you.  It's happened to me.  And if you're a doctor or researcher, please contact me.  Support groups, family or health channels, podcasts.  Anyone who can help me spread this message.  Help me, please.  help me get this good news out there.  patrons and donors.  thank you you make my videos possible and thanks to you we're going to get some babies born who need to get born now.  you all know I'm not a one-note Johnny.  I have plenty more stories and ideas to share with you and plenty more of the fine programming that you have come to expect from Hengist mountebank presents.  But I will keep coming back to this one because, damn it, we've got to get some babies on the way.  And please, send me those pregnancy and birth announcements, and we'll share them here, and we'll celebrate together.  All right, everyone, buy my book, read it, enjoy it.  If you have skin cancer, or acne, or a mutilated nose, or a junkyard dog hanging off your man parts, or what have you, there's something in there for everyone.  So get my book, get yourself a jar of dimethyl sulfoxide, get some soft music on the old stereo, and get at her. ",
