            "text": "This is a life-size Noah's Ark, and it is huge.  One and a half times the length of a football field, half the width of a football field, from ground level to the roof is seven stories high, to the biggest timber frame structure in the world.  Just about everyone around the earth has heard of Noah and the ark and the flood.  The fact that the Bible has this account, a man and his family built this great big wooden ship and all the land-dwelling air-breathing animals were represented on this ship and the whole world was flooded.  That account itself just fascinates children and adults alike.  And so we decided to build a life-size Noah's Ark based upon the dimensions in the Bible.  In 2010 Answers in Genesis began designing the Ark as a true timber frame structure and we also met with Amish carpenters who were willing to come and build the wooden structure for us.  In May of 2014, we actually kicked off the building of the ark with a hammer and peg ceremony.  In July 2015, the Amish carpenters began putting up the wooden structure.  The ark was completed over the next 13 months, and so we were able to open the ark on July 7, 2016.  As people go inside, they will identify with Noah and his family.  We just didn't build props inside the ark.  I mean, take the cages.  We built the real things.  But we built them as functioning cages so that people could see how we could feed the animals, how they could be watered, how waste could be taken away.  We wanted people to see that this really did occur.  On the third deck, we have Noah's living quarters.  And as people walk in there, they'll see Noah and his wife, and you'll see their possessions.  You'll realize we're just like them.  We're giving people a real different view that many would have about Noah and his family. ",
