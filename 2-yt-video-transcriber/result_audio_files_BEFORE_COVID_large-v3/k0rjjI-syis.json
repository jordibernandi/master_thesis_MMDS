            "text": "Last week I read this article on Forbes because I saw someone share it on Twitter.  I don't just read Forbes ordinarily, okay?  I'm not a monster.  Anyway, the article's headline announces, DC Films Still Doesn't Know What to Do with Superman.  It talks about how, despite recent successes such as Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and just recently Joker, the studio in charge of adapting DC Comics characters to the big screen can't seem to figure out what to do with the granddaddy of all superheroes.  This is not a new problem.  You know what, let me rephrase that, because what I'm getting ready to tell you is that it's not actually a problem at all.  People thinking this is a problem is not a new problem.  better.  It seems like every twenty years or so someone will wonder what the key is to telling a Superman story that will capture the imagination of the public the same way as, say, Batman or Spider-Man or those elevated B-listers in the Avengers.  It's a recurring problem that each new generation must deal with, like racism or tax reform or how to get fast food restaurants to stop trying to kill us with sugar and meat.  The Forbes article and the earlier piece in Variety, to which it often refers, states the question the same way.  I've seen it phrased since I was a teenager \u2013 how can we make Superman relevant to modern audiences?  One obvious answer is to read modern Superman comic books.  Talk to writers and artists who have made Superman stories in the last few years and see how they handled it.  The last twenty years have seen the publication of some of the best Superman stories ever written.  Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's All-Star Superman, Jeff Loeb and Tim Sale's Superman for All Seasons, Joe Kelly, Doug Manke, and Leigh Barmejo's.  What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way.  And those are just the popular ones!  I'm sure you could find a lot more inspiration if you went back and looked through the other Superman stories published in the modern era, which you could totally do if you were a stumped DC Films executive, because DC Films is a subsidiary of Warner  Bros.,  which also owns DC Comics.  You can read all the Superman comics you want!  Another suggestion might be to ask the producers of the current TV shows based on DC Comics what their secret is, because they seem to be doing just fine.  The shows that make up what's called the Arrowverse that have been airing on the CW for the last eight years or so \u2013 Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow being the main ones alongside Batwoman, which just started this year, and Stargirl, which is set to debut next year, have been doing the exact thing.  the post-Man of Steel crop of DC movies have largely failed to do \u2013 telling fun, emotionally resonant superhero stories, stories that have something to say but that are also entertaining as hell.  And wouldn't you know it, the Arrowverse has a Superman!  An awesome Superman, played by Tyler Hoechlin.  He's one of my favorite Supermans ever!  And hey, he and the Arrowverse's version of Lois Lane, played by Elizabeth Tulloch, are getting their own show!  So maybe watch that!  Because it sure seems like not everyone is at a loss for how to tell Superman stories.  By the way, before I go any further, I just want to acknowledge that there are people out there who also think that how to adapt Superman for modern audiences isn't a real problem, but for a very different reason.  Those folks think DC films shouldn't have any trouble adapting Superman because they've already done a good job with the DC Extended Universe version of Superman, the one we've seen in Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Dawn of Justice.  and Justice League, and if any of those people are seeing me right now, I just want to tell you that I respect your right to your opinion and you're watching the wrong channel.  Man of Steel was a pile of garbage.  Batman v Superman was an even bigger pile of garbage.  I didn't see Justice League, as an explanation for which I refer you to my previous statements, r.e.  the films preceding it being piles of garbage, but the consensus seemed to be that Justice League was a\u2026 slightly smaller, noticeably less noxious pile of garbage, but a pile of garbage nonetheless.  Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of the DCEU in general, nor of its take on Superman in particular.  Wonder Woman was good, not great.  I haven't seen Aquaman.  Shazam was awesome.  But when the DCEU Superman showed up at the end, my first thought was, oh, thank God Shazam is there to protect the children in that cafeteria.  Because DCEU Superman is the worst!  Because he's Zack Snyder's Superman!  And Zack Snyder is the worst person you could ever hire to make movies about Superman!  No wonder these clueless assholes have no idea what to do with this character!  The Variety article reports that Michael B. Jordan has pitched a Superman concept to the studio, which is exciting on the face of it!  Michael B. Jordan could be a terrific Superman!  It also mentions that there have been discussions with J.J.  Abrams, which could go either way.  I'm not a J.J.  hater.  I liked his Star Wars movie.  I liked his Star Trek reboot.  I think the lens flares are kind of pretty.  But once upon a time he wrote a screenplay for a Superman movie, and it got leaked online, and I read it, and it was terrible.  So, if it winds up going to  J.J.,  I hope he's got some new ideas.  Here's the bottom line, as I see it.  When you ask the question, how do we make Superman relevant to modern audiences, you're overthinking it.  There are certain fundamental characteristics of the Superman character that have been present in almost every iteration \u2013 I said almost, you fucking wrecking ball \u2013 that, treated properly, make Superman timeless and universal.  Some folks on Twitter have proposed solid starting points for a modern, relevant Superman film.  Here's one from Vex Werewolf.  Immigrant.  Fights for people even though they sometimes reject him.  Loyal to ideas and not to nations.  His most prolific enemy is a megalomaniacal billionaire who becomes the president.  Here's another suggestion from First Comic Couple, illustrated by a beautiful page from the story Glasses by Jeff Loveness and Tom Grumet, published earlier this year in DC's anthology Mysteries of Love in Space.  Show us a kind, humane, socially conscious Superman, who does the right thing not only when he's wearing the blue suit and red cape, but when he's Clark Kent as well.  Others have suggested playing up Superman as a champion of the people, citing some of the earliest stories published in the comics, which depicted Superman taking on slumlords and other villains who exploit workers and the poor, or the famous storyline from the Superman radio show, which saw Supes take on the Ku Klux Klan.  which was also the inspiration for a comic book story published this year, Superman Smashes the Klan, by Gene Luen Yang and Guri Hiroo.  Superman fighting white supremacists!  Sure seems relevant to modern audiences, given, you know, everything.  I think those are all great ideas.  I have a few suggestions of my own.  Make Lois a strong character in her own right, not just a foil-slash-love interest for Supes.  Don't treat the supporting cast, especially Perry White and Jimmy Olsen, as afterthoughts.  Don't shoot a single frame of film depicting Krypton, because Krypton is backstory, and it was only in Richard Donner's movie as an excuse to put Marlon Brando in the movie, and it's boring and pointless and only there to explain why Superman has superpowers.  Krypton blew up.  It's gone.  Tell me about Metropolis instead.  And don't make a two and a half hour movie that starts with thirty minutes on Krypton!  I don't care about Krypton!  But regardless of what your angle on Superman is, what matters the most for him is the same thing that matters the most when it comes to any other character.  What's the story?  Stop trying to make Superman relevant or make Superman cool.  Overcompensation driven by embarrassment of the source material is one of the things that resulted in the DCEU getting off to such a grim, depressing start.  We're gonna do Superman, but he's gonna be gritty and conflicted, which I guess means he's ambivalent about using his powers to help people, and he has to break a villain's neck with his bare hands before he realizes killing is bad.  You know, a superhero!  Stop overthinking it, stop pretending that he's not a comic book character, and stop acting like.  this is some kind of impossible-to-solve puzzle.  Hell, Marvel figured it out with the MCU version of Captain America years ago!  That's basically Superman.  He's honest, he's earnest, he believes in truth and justice, he embodies the stated ideals of America even if he's the only person on the planet actually trying to practice them, he's a well-rounded character with depth and complexity who has had to make difficult choices and live with the consequences, and most importantly, for you avaricious pigs who run studios, his movies made all the money!  So, you want to make Superman relevant to modern audiences?  It's easy.  Find a talented filmmaker, not the guy who loves Ayn Rand and whose best-known work outside of the DCEU is a cinematic ode to fascism, with a take on the character, and let them tell a good Superman story.  Because if you make a movie about Superman that people think is good, and lots of people buy tickets to see that movie, and it makes a lot of money, a magical thing will happen.  all the hapless dipshits who are now scratching their heads over what to do with Superman will suddenly realize, as they lovingly run their eyes across the box office returns, that Superman has been made relevant again.  To paraphrase one of the cinema's great philosophers, ain't it peculiar how success seems to do that very thing? ",
