            "text": "Why do Christians affirm the Bible as inerrant?  That is, if you're not familiar with the word inerrant, it means without error.  So why do Christians affirm that the Bible is without error?  The reasons they do that is the Bible itself, the speakers in the Bible, the authors of the Bible, present these writings as uniquely authoritative and true.  Jesus, referring to the Old Testament scriptures in John 10, says the scripture cannot be broken.  In Numbers 23, speaking about God's word, it says, God is not a man that he should lie, nor a son of man that he should change his mind.  Does he speak and then not act?  Does he promise and not fulfill?  saying that God's word cannot be broken.  It's interesting when we look in the book of Hebrews.  in chapter three and four, it quotes from Psalm 95 several times.  And one time it says David says this, another time it says the Holy Spirit says this.  So really the doctrine of inerrancy is recognizing that the words of scripture as God's words, right?  Words written by humans, recited by humans, but the exact words that God wanted written.  So in all things that they affirm and in all things that they deny, they are completely truthful because they are God's words.  This doctrine of the authority of Scripture, the inerrancy of Scripture, that Scripture does not have error, was held by the Christian church without fail, without compromise, from the time of the New Testament until the 1600s.  So it was only with the Enlightenment that you begin to have people who would call themselves Christian who would have skepticism towards the complete truthfulness of the Bible.  Sometimes college students, when they begin studying the Bible for the first time or in an academic setting, they've never really thought about some of these things before and they have a simplistic view of inerrancy.  So they'll have a professor who tries to attack their faith and says, oh, you know, we don't believe that the earth is the center of the universe.  You say, well, we don't attack the weatherman when he talks about the sun rising and the sun setting and say, this guy's an idiot.  He thinks the earth is the center of the universe.  So we recognize that the Bible uses phenomenological language, right?  It uses language to describe phenomena as we experience them.  Psalm 19 talking about the sun rising and setting without... asserting, it's not intending to teach us that the earth is the center of the solar system or something like that.  There are other things too.  There was an early English translation of the Bible that the printer accidentally reversed two letters in John chapter eight.  When Jesus spoke to the woman caught in adultery, he didn't say, go and sin no more.  In this translation, he said, go and sin on more.  Clearly, that is not a reliable translation.  That is an error.  It's not an error in the scripture.  It's an error in the translation of the scripture, right?  Because any thinking person has to ultimately say, well, printing errors do happen.  Translational nuances sometimes are less than best.  That's why there are revisions in translation.  Oh, people misunderstood this.  Let's use a different word, you know.  It's a recognition that ultimately, God inspired the Hebrew, and a few portions of Aramaic, Hebrew Old Testament, and the Greek words and phrases and language of the New Testament.  And the wonderful news for us is that we have excellent translations of these, many excellent translations in English.  And so the authority, the inerrancy of the Hebrew and Greek text is conveyed through accurate translations.  Those English translations can be affirmed as fully authoritative, fully accurate.  I think even inerrant, we're not playing linguistic games to say this text is inerrant insofar as it accurately conveys the wording of the underlying Greek and Hebrew text, which it does 99%.  You know, they say, well, there's this rewording here, it's slightly off this.  It's very minor questions.  Now, the other option, I guess, for a Christian is to say, well, I'm uncomfortable even saying that English translations can ever be wrong.  Well, then I guess you're going to have to affirm one English translation as re-inspired by God and fully authoritative and, you know, stop looking at the Greek and Hebrew text because this is the timeless, inerrant English text.  And I think most people, when they step back and think about it, they say that that's not really, that doesn't really hold up to scrutiny.  Again, we want to have a robust and reliable view of inerrancy, not a simplistic and foolish view.  So someone might read the Gospel of Mark beside the Gospel of Luke and say, well, here it says there are two people who saw this, and here, one, was it one or two?  Well, again, the authors of Scripture sometimes give partial reporting of an episode.  Sometimes they summarize it.  Sometimes they will paraphrase people's words.  But always in such a way as to convey those things truthfully in a non-deceptive and non-distorting way.  I find that people who are very skeptical and attacking of the Bible don't apply that same kind of attacking skepticism to other things in life.  And if they did, they would not be able to live or function.  Just an example of this.  A while back, my wife, the battery died on her car.  her van.  And so I had to drive there in my car.  It was at Walgreens.  And I waited with the van while the AAA guy came and replaced the battery.  And over the course of the next day or two, I had several times I had to talk about that with different people.  And I talked about it.  I said, well, why didn't I come to something?  Oh, I'm sorry.  My car, the battery died.  Another time, my wife, I had to wait at the Walgreens forever with my wife's car.  Another time I'm talking about my wife's van.  Well, someone with a very skeptical and sort of a literalistic demands for consistency that are not congruent with just normal speaking and truth telling would say, well, you're a huge liar.  First off, does your wife have a van or does she have a car?  Secondly, is it your car or is it her car?  Is it her van or is it your van?  And you say, well, within normal English usage, to refer to a minivan as a car is acceptable, it's a vehicle.  Secondly, we're married, it's my van, it's her van, it's my car, it's her car.  And so there's this kind of recognition that in just normal communication about anything, we give partial reporting in such a way that if anyone lines things up in a rigid algebraic formulation and shows these, you know, surface level discrepancies, you know, it can seem kind of unsettling to someone until they recognize.  this is a foolish, unfounded, and untenable way of looking at documents.  The Old and New Testament are reliable.  They're truthful.  inerrant in everything they assert and in everything they deny.  It's not to say that as someone reads them, questions don't arise.  Well, what does this mean?  Or how does this fit with this?  These are questions that can and should be explored by Christians because God is not trying to deceive us.  He's a reliable, loving, heavenly Father.  And there are all kinds of resources that are available to explore these questions.  A good study Bible like the ESV Study Bible published by Crossway has extensive footnotes explaining, oh, okay, I see, you know, this city, I see how they're identifying it as composed of the city.  It's not saying this happened at that time, right?  There are good and reliable explanations for these apparent discrepancies and questions that Christians have when they read the Bible.  There's also a classic text, it's somewhat dated now, but the Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties by Gleason Archer is a helpful resource, and there are other resources like that that are available.  If you read the early Christian writings, commentaries written on books even from the four and five hundreds, you'll find that these Christians, like Theodore of Mopsuetia, it's unthinkable to him that the words of the Apostle John could be in any way an error.  It's unthinkable because it's the word of God.  But he's not simplistic and foolish about it.  He'll say, well, it's interesting here, the date of the Passover, and we look at this compared to the Synoptic Gospels.  Why do we have this difference?  Christians didn't, if you read throughout Christian history, they didn't say, well, don't think about that.  They said, yeah, there are explanations for this.  Let's talk about it.  If we look back at that, it gives us a good model for being people who our heart and our trust is in the word of God, but when we notice something that raises a question, we're not afraid to think about it.  We're not afraid to look at resources.  We're not afraid to pray about it.  We're not afraid to ask a trusted pastor or scholar or friend about those questions.  knowing that God is not hiding things from us, he's not trying to deceive us, his word is reliable, and he will give us the answers we need at the right time.
