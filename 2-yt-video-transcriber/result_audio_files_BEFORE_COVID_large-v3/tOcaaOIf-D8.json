Pastor Kenan, welcome back to Real Life.  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.  Yeah, it's so good to have you back.  So tell me about breakthrough, first of all.  What is spiritual breakthrough?  And why do I need it?  I mean, you know, what's it look like? ",

            "text": "You know, I like to define breakthrough as the breaking forth of God's power, His purpose, and His presence.  in a person's life.  A beautiful example is in Genesis 38, there's a woman named Tamar who is really, for lack of better words, she's really messed up.  She's going through rejection, she's been defrauded, she's been mistreated.  And there's a verse in Genesis 38 where it says, and when the time of her delivery had come, the Bible says that The first baby came out, but he put out his hand and the midwife tied a red thread around his arm.  And then the second baby broke out and he was born first.  He should have been the last, but he was born first.  And the scripture says that the midwife looked at him and said, how did you break through?  And she called the baby Phares or Paras in Hebrew.  It means to burst forth or to break out.  And so it was really a prophetic symbolism of breakthrough that in her darkest hour, the time of her biggest distress, God manifested an unusual way.  And so when we talk about breakthrough, we're talking about a suddenly from God.  We're talking about when God shifts the outcome of a situation or circumstances and he does it supernaturally. ",

You know, I'm reminded of something.  When you look at the lineage, that it talks about the lineage, you know, in the gospel account, it says there's a verse where it says, and Judah begot Phares.  And that simple verse is a key because Judah means praise and Phares means breakthrough.  And one of the keys of breakthrough is praise.  You know, when you're going through a difficult situation and you're going through something that you can't handle on your own, but you begin to extend yourself beyond the limitation.  by inviting God in, by worshiping, by praising him, you open up a supernatural door for a miracle to take place in your life.

            "text": "One of the things that I think we really forget is the power of faith.  You know, the scripture says we fight the good fight of faith.  Faith is the confidence in what you can't see in the natural.  The Bible says it's the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of what you can't see.  And so faith is a spiritual currency in the kingdom of God.  It's how we receive the things in the invisible realm.  I mean, if you think about the children of Israel, one day they're slaves, the next day they're free.  And it happened suddenly.  And I believe somebody is watching and there's a suddenly.  that's about to happen to you.  You might be bound, you might be depressed, you might be broken, but you're about to be set free by the power of God.  And I believe that faith is such a, pervasive key when it comes to breakthrough.  You have to learn how to press.  I'm reminded of the woman with the issue of blood who said within herself, and I believe that's another key.  We have to say things within ourselves.  We can't wait for it to be said to us.  You know, you have to have a conversation with yourself when you're going to church.  You have to say, you know what, today is going to be different.  When you go home, you say, you know what?  My marriage is going to change tonight.  When you go to your children, my child's going to turn around tonight.  It has to be an internal conversation that you're so convinced that God's word is going to come to pass that nothing can stop you. ",

You see, when we look at all these different situations and I talk about in the book, I give an example of the gut level cry and Bartimaeus and how he made a decision that Jesus was passing by, the Messiah was coming by, but he had to make a decision.  that today's gonna be different.  I may have been here for years, I may have been blind for my whole life, but today something's gonna change.  And nobody can convince me otherwise.  Or we can use the example of the Syrophoenician woman who was so desperate for a miracle that she withstood insult from Jesus himself, who said, I can't give this to dogs.  And she said, yeah, even the dogs, eat the crumbs from their master's table.  And Jesus was so moved by her faith and her expectancy that he was forced to release a miracle in her life.  And I believe that that's what we have to be in this season. ",

I could, I could deal with it, but it's hard to even fit in my concept of Jesus, you know, but, um, You mentioned a couple of several examples biblically there of where someone just, and I'll use your term, they stormed the gates.  Can you explain storming the gates?  Because we know the gates of hell will not prevail against us.  What's that mean in our practical day-to-day life? ",

            "text": "It's one of the most misinterpreted scriptures in the Bible.  Matthew 16, when Jesus is telling Peter about who he is based off of this revelation that he's the Messiah, He tells Peter, you're a stone, you're a rock.  And upon this rock, which is a different word, I'll build my church.  And that's the rock of revelation.  And he says, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.  Well, you know, gates don't move.  They're stationary.  They didn't have rolling gates 2000 years ago, like we do.  They didn't have electronic gates that could move and all this stuff.  So really the imagery is not us resisting the enemy.  The imagery that Jesus is painting for us is us barging into the enemy's territory and taking from him what belongs to us.  And Jesus gives this example in another place when he talks about binding the strong man.  And so the church was never called to be passive.  There's nothing in the kingdom of God that happens through osmosis, through twiddling your thumbs and saying one day it's gonna happen and by and by when the morning comes.  but you have to be aggressive.  We are not some spiritual passive community.  We are anointed, we are empowered.  We have the whole kingdom of heaven standing behind us when we operate according to God's word.  And I believe that's what we need to be, especially in our nation right now.  You know, there's some promises that God's made to this country, and they're not going to fall in our lap.  We have to fight for them.  We have to go into the enemy's camp and take what he's stolen from us, our children, our morality, our justice, our truth, our unity.  We have to fight for these things.

            "text": "You know, it's interesting because I think for many people, there are invisible forces that they're not aware of.  Hosea 4, 6 says, my people perish for lack of knowledge.  Ephesians 6, 12 says that, Excuse me, that Satan is the ruler of the darkness.  And one of the words there, skotos, it means ignorance, which means that Satan has legal jurisdiction to operate in your ignorance.  And when the ignorance is exposed, his power is broken.  You can't fight a battle that you can't see.  And I believe that what we need to do is we need to ask God to open our spiritual eyes so that we can see the hindrances that are hindering what God wants to do.  I'm reminded of Daniel in Daniel chapter 7 where the Bible says that he caught wind of the fact that there was something that was supposed to be happening in Israel.  that wasn't happening.  God promised it, but they weren't seeing it.  So he literally went before the courts of heaven.  The scripture says that when he went before God, it says that the courts were seated and the books were open.  And by the 11th chapter, something happened.  So sometimes we have to go in intercession and address these invisible hindrances that may be affecting what God wants to do in our lives. ",

It was like vroom, right like Joseph.  It went from the prison to leading the nation, just like that.  He didn't work his way up the corporate ladder, did he?  Exactly, exactly.  Well, I've got some, they're telling me I gotta end this segment, so we'll wait till the next segment because I've got some questions about signs and wonders and miracles in our life that I think are so key.
