            "text": "We've learned that China's chief negotiator literally laughed in the face of Donald Trump in the oval office during recent trade talks that are going on, which of course, as I'll show you momentarily, Donald Trump is claiming we're just so extraordinarily successful.  But let me sort of set it up for you and then we'll get into the new details.  Um, Donald Trump campaigned on knowing all about trade policy and he's going to fix trade policy and it's going to be great for them for the little guy in four middle america and he's going to and that trade imbalance with china and everything's going to be great and everybody's is going to be winning bigly.  Uh, Donald Trump instated some tariffs.  It turns out that they actually caused the opposite rather than reducing the trade deficit.  The trade deficit has increased to a record levels.  Donald Trump now is claiming on Twitter that maybe he's not going to need more new tariffs which were scheduled to be enacted on March 1st because things are just going so well.  in his conversations with China.  He tweeted over the weekend, quote, I am pleased to report that the U S has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues, including intellectual property protection, technology transfer agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues.  As a result of these very productive talks, I will be delaying the U.S.  increase in tariffs, now scheduled for March 1.  Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a summit for President Xi and myself at Mar-a-Lago, of course.  to conclude an agreement, a very good weekend for the U?  S and China.  So the first question is, did things actually go well or is Trump realizing that the tariffs he's already enacted are disastrous for the United States and he's trying to find a way out of enacting further tariffs?  The answer to that question is probably yes, but let's put that issue aside just for a second and talk about what took place in the oval office.  It turns out that Trump exposed in these talks, including a briefly filmed a piece of it that he doesn't understand even the most minor elements of how trade works and was literally laughed at by a Chinese negotiator who was in the room in the oval office.  I'll set the stage for you.  Um, either before or after at some point in the process of these trade discussions, they let cameras into the oval office.  Um, there's trade officials there.  The Chinese vice premier Liu Hay is in there.  The topic is trade agreements, but Donald Trump gets into this really weird back and forth with, um, Robert Lighthizer who's the white house's top negotiator and they start arguing about MOUs and MOU is a memorandum of understanding.  And they start arguing over whether an MOU is a real agreement or merely some kind of like pre agreement agreement, but you still need the actual agreement later.  You'll be able to tell from this video I'm going to play for you that Donald Trump clearly thinks that the MOU is just a sort of, well, we'll sort of agree to do some stuff maybe in principle, but Trump doesn't really believe an MOU is worth anything.  The reality is that MOUs are contracts.  Trump doesn't like the name more than likely.  I'm guessing this is because Donald Trump has had MOUs signed for real estate deals and he ended up getting screwed.  So he thinks that it's the same thing in politics that an MOU between two countries isn't worth anything, but it actually, it is a contract.  So what I'm going to play for you here is video of Donald Trump arguing about this with his own top negotiator, Robert Lighthizer and Trump in the midst of arguing with him.  It's just amazing.  He's, he's negotiating with the Chinese, but he's arguing with his own negotiator over the semantic difference between an MOU and a deal and an agreement and a contract.  You have to sort of listen carefully, but when Lighthizer explains to Trump that he's wrong, that MOUs are contracts, you hear a laugh in the background and everybody in the room has said that that was the China, Chinese vice premier Liu Hey, who can't believe what's going on.

Can you imagine coming to the, to the oval office all the way from China to try to avert more tariffs, which are just mutually damaging to the, to the U S and to China.  And Donald Trump is having a semantic disagreement with his top negotiator in front of cameras, but not one that is even particularly relevant.  He just doesn't agree with the name of what these agreements are.  His top negotiator says this, this is not just like a general term sheet.  These are agreements, these are contracts, these are binding period.  And even after this, Trump just continues for another minute harping on this semantic disagreement. ",

I don't care if you do it or not.  To me, it doesn't mean very much.  But if you do a memorandum, how long will it take to put that into a final binding contract?

It was explained to him multiple times in this video that the MOU is a binding contract.  Uh, and he insists that it's not.  He keeps saying either we're going to do a deal or we're not.  I don't care about MOUs, but his chief negotiator, you can see how the propagandizing of all of this stuff works and how Trump ends up thinking that he's right and that he's smarter.  Because Trump is holding up in an embarrassing way, the entire substantive discussion about what will the agreement say?  Are we tariffing or not?  Right?  Those are the relevant questions.  Trump is holding up the entire thing.  over his understanding of what's the difference between an MOU and whatever else his chief negotiator clearly just to placate Trump, not because Trump's right, because he sees that it's becoming a huge distraction, says, Hey, you know what?  We're not going to call it an MOU.  We're literally going to have the exact same document, but we're going to change the title to a trade agreement.  This doesn't substantively change anything.  It merely placates Trump, but then Trump actually thinks he made a good point.  We knew this was happening behind the scenes.  Pat, we would learn about how behind the scenes staffers are endlessly frustrated with how Trump just doesn't understand stuff and they have to dumb things down or appear to acquiesce when in reality we're talking about semantics and a 70 something year old man who just doesn't get it.  We just saw what normally happens behind the scenes, which is increasingly frustrated.  adults in the room go, this guy doesn't get it.  You want us to call it an agreement instead of an MOU?  They're just crossing out the name and naming it something else, but it's the exact same thing. ",

This is one of those things where Trump will go to a rally and he'll have written into his speech how he came in.  and forced a deal rather than just an MOU.  If we didn't have video.  that minute and a half becomes at a rally.  Trump saying, listen, they came in, the Chinese came in and my negotiators came in and if it weren't for me, they would have come out of this thing with just an MOU and it wouldn't have gone anywhere.  But I went in there and I negotiated because I'm a good negotiator.  and I said, we're not doing an MOU, we're doing an agreement and we're getting it done and it's going to be mind binding.  And then his MAGA hat wearing crowd all starts cheering.  We now have the video of this and we saw it was a really dumb semantic disagreement which led to people who understand stuff realizing this guy's a moron.  If he wants us to change the name of the document, we'll change the name.  That would be a minute and a half to two minutes at a speech of Donald Trump claiming some kind of big art of the deal negotiation victory.  The only other thing I want to say about this, understand now that in the same way that the adults in the room are conceding here and saying, we'll call it whatever the hell this guy wants because we've just got to move on and talk about the substance.  This probably leads to a lot of people acquiescing to Trump's stupid demands because he just doesn't get what is even being discussed.  And in order to move things along, my guess is this type of thing where everybody says, oh my God, just call it whatever the hell he wants so we can move on.  It's probably happening all the time and in some cases it's probably more actionably significant, materially significant than this particular example.  This reminds me, this allows me to preview.  by the way, we are planning an upcoming segment on an issue in the United States.  Um, which is an issue of culture.  It's an issue of politics.  It's an issue of economics and class and a lot of different things.  The growing intellectual divide in the United States of America.  This is a real thing.  This video, uh, is a great opportunity for me to mention that that's something that we're working on and we'll have that coming up for you at some point very, very soon.  Let's take a break.  Make sure to give us a like on Facebook at facebook.com.  slash David Pakman show.  Plenty more to discuss. ",
