            "text": "What's up guys Patrick back with the clown news network.  And, um, today I wanted to cover this article that I saw recently.  And, uh, it is that Americans are having less sex, uh, in 2018, 2019.  And it's a little bit strange to me because most people know that America has basically no morals anymore.  And, uh, even if you talk to foreigners who moved to America, who are say not from south of the border, but from other countries, they will often, um, basically say how casually Americans have sex.  And, um, so it's a little bit of a surprise when an article like this comes out that actually documents the truth and the facts behind it.  So more Americans, okay, reported having less sex in 2018 than any year since 1989.  And so it's being called a sex drought.  And so they did a survey and they're finding an alarming trend.  And that is the number of people reporting no sex in the last year is up to 23%.  So almost one out of four people are failing to get it on adequately.  Um, So it's kind of strange considering they have all those apps, you know, like, uh, that allow you to hook up with complete strangers and, um, you know, there's Craigslist and all these, like, uh, these websites where you can randomly meet some, uh, strange person for sexual relations.  But to me, it doesn't surprise me one bit because I know that the official story is often not what the reality reflects.  So that brings me to this article, which is the one I really wanted to cover today.  And that is the fact that the biggest jewelry chain in the world is giving up on America's dying shopping malls.  Okay.  Yeah.  So they act like it's the mall's fault.  Okay.  It's not the mall's fault.  It's the fact that consumers have no money to spend on things that are not, um, you know, beans, milk and toilet paper.  And so.  this is why malls are shutting down.  This is why, uh, the biggest, you know, jeweler in the world is closing a bunch of stores.  Okay.  So signet jewelers, which is the parent company, um, announced that it plans to close 150 stores over the next year.  All right.  And it's not just 150 stores because actually what they're going to be doing, um, is closing a total.  Let me see if I have the number here somewhere.  Anyway, it's more than 150 stores is what I'm getting at.  Okay.  Yeah.  Here, here's the number I'm looking for.  They already closed 262 stores, 232 of them in North America.  And so now they're going to close another 150.  And let me ask you a question.  Why would a jewelry store be shutting down?  around the same time that americans are having less sex?  you think the two are unrelated.  of course they're not.  well here's the answer.  okay consumers have less money to spend and more americans live at home with their parents than at any time uh in history for the last 75 years.  so Parents in the U.S.  cannot get rid of their kids.  The share of young adults in their late 20s living with their parents is the highest it's been in 75 years.  According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, 33% of people in their late 20s live with their parents or grandparents in 2016.  Now I have no doubt in my mind that's only gotten worse in the last couple of years because the economy, the real economy, has been slumping in America and around the world.  But another reason why this is significant is because you got to think, when do people spend money on jewelry when they have extra money to burn, right?  When do people spend money on jewelry when they want to get married?  So as less people get married, as less people have sex, as less people have money to spend on diamonds and rings and stuff like this, what you're seeing is a new poverty class.  Okay.  And they can, and they can shift the blame, deflect the blame on dying shopping malls, but notice, okay.  They didn't say the sales are shifting to online sales because people are not going online to amazon.com to buy a wedding ring or an engagement ring.  That's not happening.  Um, and I seriously doubt it will ever happen.  Okay.  When people want to go make a large purchase, uh, like a gold ring, um, or diamonds, they want to be able to take it out of the display case and look at it, you know, and, and put it on and see how it looks on them.  Because if you're going to spend, you know, 2000, 5,000, $10,000 on a worthless rock to put on your finger.  Okay.  You're probably going to, you're, you're going to want to know that it's real and you're going to want to be a hundred percent satisfied with how it looks.  Um, so as these jewelry stores close, as Americans report having less sex than ever, as more Americans live at home, okay, and are depressed and aren't having sex.  All right.  And here we have another stat.  54% of unemployed Americans didn't have a steady romantic partner compared with only 32% among the employed.  So over half of unemployed Americans, you know, they're not dating, they're not in a relationship.  And why would they be?  I mean, when you're focused on surviving and paying your basic bills, Um, how attractive do you feel?  How attractive does the other sex, the opposite sex find you?  All right.  I mean, this is just a fact of life.  Uh, in the great depression, the great depression was, was, uh, a huge cause for the breakup of families.  And when men couldn't find work and then they started hitching rides on the railroads, just going around town to town, looking for work, um, their marriages failed.  So lots of divorces happened.  Lots of marriage breakups happened in the great depression.  And so this does not surprise me considering what we're heading into.  The real economic news out there is completely different than what the mainstream media, the 1%, and all of their cohorts and their lackeys and their minions are telling you about.  Okay, we're getting an upshot in jobless claims being filed.  We're getting a freeze on hiring with small businesses.  Basically we have, we have reached peak Trump.  We have reached peak exuberance.  And now the only thing that's going to get that stock market to keep going up at this point is president Trump initiating quantitative easing again, which he has publicly called for recently.  Dropping interest rates further from that nominal 2.25 to 2.5% down to zero or going into negative territory.  which basically leaves them no room to fight the next recession according to the way central banks do their thing and their boom and bust cycle.  But we are on the precipice of a period of massive economic recession and depression in America and around the world because this is not just affecting America.  Actually, America right now is the best house on a bad street.  And so These are just some news snippets I wanted to share with people today to show, look, if the economy was so great, if everything was going just so wonderfully for everyone out there, then people would be going out.  They'd be buying engagement rings.  They'd be buying houses.  They'd be getting married.  They'd be having so much sex that they wouldn't even have time to post what they ate today for lunch on Facebook.  But that is not what's happening, is it?  So anyway, I hope you enjoy this video and that you got something out of it.  Um, please comment below if you have something to add to this or any newsworthy information on the economy or society.  And, uh, I will see you on the next video.  All right, y'all take care. ",
