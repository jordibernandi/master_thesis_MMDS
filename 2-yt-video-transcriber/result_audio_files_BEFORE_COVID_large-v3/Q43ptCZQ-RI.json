            "text": "Bible Answers with Dr.  Al Garza.  Alright, welcome back to Bible Answers.  Today we're going to be discussing a passage of scripture that's used by a number of Reformers and Calvinists regarding God's decree upon the elect.  And we're going to be discussing Acts 13, verse 48.  Now, I'm going to be quoting from a Reformer, a Calvinistic Reformer, who is very well respected and known in Reform theology.  So I'm going to read from one of his books on this very passage.  We're going to discuss it.  as far as seeing, does it really say what he's saying in regards to the pluperfect in the Greek of the passage in chapter 13, verse 48.  So we're going to look at the Greek grammar.  I'm going to be quoting a Greek grammarian on this, and we're going to look at how this individual also interprets or looks at the passage himself and see, does it fit?  Now, I want to say something real brief here.  And I've said this numerous times in my other videos.  The idea, the Calvinistic reform teaching of God having, electing certain individuals to eternal life and others he does not, is foreign, one, to the Hebrew scriptures, the Old Testament, completely foreign, that concept.  It is also completely foreign in the first century Jew culture.  or Judaizing mindset of first century Jews, rabbinic Jews, pharisaical Jews, it's foreign even to them.  And Paul being a Pharisee and a student under Gamaliel, the grandson of Hillel, it would have been foreign to him as well.  There is a type of language that God has chosen and elected a people, a nation, as recorded in the Hebrew scriptures, which we find all over the place, but never in the sense of individuality.  So even in outside non-biblical sources, these same concepts and ideas are not taught in the way Calvinistic reformers teach it.  They're also foreign even to those texts.  In the short booklet that I wrote, Calvinism Challenge, which you can find on Amazon, I deal with a number of these things.  From the Hebrew scriptures, I quote a scholarship in non-biblical areas of Christianity.  how the Jews understood these ideas of sin and choosing good versus evil and doing right and wrong and choice and all that.  And also moving into the New Testament as well.  But it is completely foreign.  So the passage we're going to look at here is in Acts 13.  Now the context, I'm going to briefly give you the context.  We have to have the context all the way up to this point because it's important if we're going to discuss specific verses.  is that what leads up to this?  and then what is the conclusion.  So here is, we look at Acts 13.  You can start even at verses 14 and look at all the way down the context, but I'm going to give you a brief context overview here.  Paul, of course, they arrive.  It's Paul, I believe it's, it says, So they arrive at Pisidian Antioch, and this is Paul, and on the Sabbath day, they went in the synagogue and sat down.  And after reading of the Torah and the prophets, the synagogue official sent them, saying, Brethren, if we have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.  And then Paul stood up and motioned with his hand, and he said, and he goes on with men of Israel, and he starts going through the Hebrew scriptures, talking from Abraham down.  Excuse me, going all the way down to Abraham, talking, going through Psalms, going through the Torah and the Prophets and Psalms, basically, all the way to the very end of showing how Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah, the one foretold in the Scriptures.  It says, as Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.  Now, when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the grace of God.  It says, the next Sabbath, nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of the Lord.  Now, the whole city came, which would include Gentiles and probably the Jews and the Hellenists and the proselytes, those who converted into Judaism to practice it like a Jew.  And then it says, but when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul.  and were blaspheming.  But Paul spoke out boldly and said, It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first, speaking of the Jews, since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life.  Behold, we are turning to the  nations.\".  For so the Lord has commanded us.  Now he's going to quote Isaiah here.  I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.  Now here he's quoting Isaiah 49, 6.  And then he says, and then Luke writes, when the nations or the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced.  They began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord.  And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.  Now, the controversy is on that last part.  And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believe.  Now, the idea we're going to look at is, what is the interpretation of a Reformed Calvinist?  How does it look at in the Greek and the grammar?  And then, is there any other way to look at this other than Reformer?  So, one Reformer, one Calvinistic Reformer, wrote a book, and he quotes this.  And, of course, he starts using all different translations, which I'll look at.  Some say, who were appointed to eternal life, who had been destined to eternal life.  Other translations said, who had been appointed, who were appointed to eternal life, who had been appointed to eternal life, believed.  So these are different versions of, you know, the way it reads.  The word that's used in the Greek, of course, is not in debate of how it's used in the Pluperfect.  Now, I'll read what a Pluperfect is in a minute, but I want to read first what this individual says about the Pluperfect, and then we're going to look at from the grammar what it means.  And then kind of see, does it fit?  And is there a different way we can look at this?  So here's how this reformer says, Luke uses the imperfect form of I mean, together with a perfect passive participle.  The result is that the phrase must be translated as a perfect.  Now, that phrase is, of course, we're pointed to eternal life.  You know, life, believe those who were the perfect sense.  The pluperfect sense speaks of a completed action in the past, but unlike the perfect tense, it says the pluperfect does not contain the idea of a continuation of the past action into the present time.  So this is important because this is where they're going to get the idea that God has elected some of those Gentiles to eternal life and not the others.  And this is going to be their answer for this.  So again, he says, the pluperfect does not contain the idea of a continuation of the past action into the present time.  Therefore, the meaning of appointed refers to a past action.  And then he says, some were appointed to eternal life as part of the eternal decree of God and others were not.  Now, he does mention briefly the other view that I'm going to share with you.  that fits a lot better in this context than the one he's trying to say here.  So his idea is that some were appointed to eternal life as part of the eternal decree of God and others were not.  based on the pluperfect, which again does not contain the idea of a continuation of the past action into the present time.  So he's dealing with the pluperfect as a continuous action that doesn't mention that into the present.  It's not a continuous thing, because what we're going to look at is how Paul quotes Isaiah, that salvation has come to the nations, and he's trying to refute the idea that that pluperfect could reflect back to that time frame, and then be effective to that time that Luke is writing when Paul is speaking it.  So he's saying that there's no way it can be a continuation.  Now, here's a Greek grammar book.  This is, of course, Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics by Daniel Wallace, which is used as a textbook of Greek grammar in numerous colleges and universities.  And this is what he says defining the pluperfect.  He says... The pluperfect, speaking of existing results in the past, at this tense occurs only in the indicative move.  Thus it may be said that the pluperfect combines the aspects of an aorist for the event and an imperfect for the result.  To put this another way, the force of the pluperfect tense is that it describes an event that, completed in the past, has results that exist in the past as well in relation to the time of speaking.  The pluperfect makes no comment about the results existing up to the time of speaking.  Often, however, it can be ascertained from the context whether or not the results do indeed exist up to the time of speaking.  This is on page 583.  The Plutberg does speak of an event that has taken place in the past, and we're not talking about a continuation, as this reformer says, but a result that reflects the past and at the time of the person speaking it.  So there can be a line drawn, not in the sense of continuation, but that the fact that it happened at this point in time, Which I'm arguing where Isaiah spoke it.  And then it's happening again at the time when Paul is speaking, quoting Isaiah to the Gentiles there, to the nations, saying, salvation has come to the nations here.  And then some, the Gentiles who heard and believed, some of them were appointed based on the prophecy of Isaiah.  And it's happening again.  The result, the action is happening once again there in Acts 30, 48.  Nowhere in this text of Isaiah does it mention what the Reformers are saying.  This is an individual, you know, individuals being pointed out from eternal past, a decree of God, of eternity past.  These are already elected and pre-chosen of God.  That's an interpretation into the text.  And the Pluperfect can go neither, either, or on that way of giving the specifics of the result.  As he says, the Pluperfect makes no comment about the results existing up until the time of speaking.  But he does say this, the force of the Pluperfect tense is that it describes an event that, completed in the past, has results that existed in the past as well in relation to the time of speaking.  So it can, exactly what Paul says, what happened at the time of Isaiah when he spoke it.  at that time, there were results.  And the blue brick is pointing to that as it also happening when Paul is saying it and quoting the blue brick that it's even happening at this moment.  So there can be a line drawn and a line drawn can indicate the results of an action from that point to that point, the results of both timeframes.  It doesn't have to be a continuation, which is true, but the results are the same.  What the results were at the time of Isaiah, Paul is saying it's happening again, the results are happening now.  And the pluperfect is reflective of what happened at the time of Isaiah.  So it's not a decree of eternal past, as this reformer wants to say.  It's a result of action that happened through Isaiah, when God spoke to Isaiah at that time, in Isaiah 46, regarding the nations and salvation and being a light, to Paul quoting and saying, and today it is happening again.  So it's not a continuation moving line, but the results are happening again.  And the context, as the grammar says, dictates whether or not we can ascertain that, and we can, based on verse 47.  So this is not speaking of a eternal decree, as there's just no way that can be.  That's an interpretation.  And to me, it can be, it's deeply flawed because it's trying to fit a theology that's been very foreign to the text, foreign to the Jews, and foreign in every way, as we know in scripture.  So this, again, answers that question.  The Pluperfect is not talking about God's decree from eternity past.  That's an interpretation.  But it's describing an event that has happened in the past and is also happening again at the time that Paul is speaking.  Not a continuation, but the results are the same.  And Paul is reflecting back to Isaiah, an action that happened in the past, completed in the past, at the time of Isaiah speaking it.  And it's happening again at the time when he's speaking here.  So those Gentiles, like in Isaiah's time, were appointed or appointed.  you know, taken into eternal life, because why?  They heard, they rejoiced, and they believed.  Therefore, as Isaiah prophesied, they were appointed to eternal life, those who did hear, rejoice, and believe.  So that is also another interpretation that's ignored, and I don't know why, but the context is clear based on the verse prior and the context as a whole.  So, you know, this reformer can argue one side, but it can easily be dismissed.  Again, he's concluding based off of his position that this is a decree of God from time past eternity, and ignoring Isaiah, who Paul's quoting as a completed action at that point, and also as a result of the existing action of the speaker who just spoke it, according to Daniel Wallace.  which we can get from the context.  So I hope this helps.  I hope this helps answer Acts 13, 48.  It is not a reformed Calvinistic verse and position, very foreign to the text of the Hebrew scriptures and the first century Jewish mindset.  So I hope this helps.
