            "text": "Now you go over to silver and what you see is that going back to 1969, there's only been two times in history that this happened.  Hi, this is Mike Maloney with an update on the precious metals markets, especially silver.  My last video was what's up with silver?  and there is definitely something up.  You're going to want to stick around for some of this because I really find this stuff interesting, and I've really cherished this pullback that we've been through for the past five years.  I call it a mid-cycle correction because it has allowed me to accumulate a lot more ounces of precious metals, especially silver, especially when the gold-silver ratio is at levels like this, where silver is so incredibly undervalued compared to gold.  but here you see gold's performance over the past couple of years and over the past couple of months.  it's been rising and the rise over the last week or two has been a decent rise but it isn't huge.  Now you take a look at silver and what you see here is that silver's big move has all been in just a little bit over a week here.  It's had a spectacular move lately And it's up in an area of resistance.  So that's what's going on with the price.  And because gold was moving first, the gold-silver ratio would have been rising because silver wasn't going anywhere.  So that means silver was becoming more and more undervalued with gold.  then when silver took off like a rocket that gold silver ratio would have fallen back a little.  and that's exactly what happened here.  this is the gold silver ratio and as you know up in the eighties here i've just been buying only silver at this point No gold.  I want to buy gold.  when I read bad things about the global economy and when I think about what's coming, because the longer they keep on patching things up and trying to stimulate the global economy with all these Keynesian moves, Keynesian economics, where they manipulate what used to be a free market, there's always consequences to that.  Except the consequences don't all have to play out right away.  They can sort of store up, you know, like piling stuff up in the closet and nobody opens that door.  One day when somebody opens that door, it's all going to fall out on top of them because they've stacked all of these manipulations up so high.  Now, when it comes to the, this is the weekly transparent gold holdings.  So this is the repositories.  So this is like the commodities exchange, the metals exchange in London.  These are those vaults plus mutual funds and ETFs, which is also stored in the same vaults.  Basically, it's just categorized.  differently, but it's not in, it's not been taken of delivery, taken delivery of and stored by a private investor.  So this is the stuff that these repositories all publish on a monthly basis.  And what you see with gold, I pointed this out in the last video, is this correlation of when the price is rising, the accumulated number of ounces is rising.  When the price falls, the accumulated number, people sell off and there's fewer ounces in these repositories, in these investment classes.  And it's a very high degree of correlation.  And you've seen quite a bit of accumulation in gold recently.  But when you go to silver, wow, it's a very different story up until just the past couple of weeks.  The price on silver falls, the number of ounces rises.  This is what professional traders do.  The price rises, the number of ounces falls.  They're taking profits.  The price falls, the number of ounces rises.  But then in just the past several weeks, the price rises and the number of ounces rises.  And I pointed out that there's this huge accumulation.  Well, in the last video, there wasn't this bar yet.  And this bar is something big.  Some sort of indicator.  I mean, you remember old movies with a picture of some giant computer that takes up a whole wall and it had a whole bunch of flashing lights on it.  Well, this is a whole bunch of lights flashing red.  There is something going on.  I don't know what it is.  You know, last week I was sort of reporting on an article that Alistair McLeod did about one big whale coming in, and he thought that that whale was China.  Ted Butler has since disputed Alistair McLeod's article.  Now, I love and have great respect for both of these guys.  I really like them.  I like the work they do.  And they're both working on our behalf.  So my hat is off to them.  Now, one of them is going to be right on this.  And basically, I don't care who it is.  They're both great guys.  They're both doing good work.  Whoever is right, it doesn't matter because the effect is going to be a very positive effect.  Now, I still, as long as things are going good in the general economy and the stock markets are going up, I would still like to see a further pullback in gold and silver because, like I said, this pullback has allowed me, over the last five years, I've accumulated a lot more ounces.  I mean a lot more.  And I've been cherishing this because I know that one day it's going to explode higher and I will see vast increases in my personal wealth.  I dread what's going to happen to some of the mainstream investors and the average guy on the street because I don't think the economy is going to look pretty.  I wish they would learn about this stuff and try to protect themselves.  But let's go out a bit further.  Here's 20 years of the gold price and the number of ounces accumulated in repositories.  And what you see again is this high correlation price rises, accumulation rises, price falls, accumulation falls, price rises, accumulation, you know, price rise, accumulation rise, price falls, accumulation falls.  And like I said, these are almost mirror images of each other, these two lines.  This is what small investors do, and small investors usually suffer losses.  You can see the accumulation in these bars, and you can see the sell-offs in these bars, where they're divesting themselves of the metals.  What's interesting is gold, the accumulation like in the past month and the month before, there's a whole lot of other times in the past where the accumulation of the past month has been greatly exceeded in gold.  And then even the accumulation the month before, quite a number of times in the past where the accumulation has exceeded what has been going on lately.  But when we go over to silver, that again is a different story.  Silver, the accumulation that has just happened this month, has not happened in the last 20 years except for once.  And that was because silver was making this big charge up toward 50 bucks.  I mean, silver was on fire back then.  going from like $18 to $26.  This is a two-week time period, this enormous leap.  That's the reason for this huge accumulation.  Now, Let's go back even further.  Here's gold going back to 1969.  And what you see is, I mean, dozens and dozens of times that gold has exceeded last month.  And then I believe I counted like 14 times or something like that, that it exceeded its highs of the month before, as far as the amount of ounces being accumulated.  now you go over to silver and what you see is that going back to 1969 there's only been two times in history that this happened.  that uh silver has that as many ounces have been accumulated.  and then you look at this long-term trend and you see just there's no correlation here whatsoever.  and then the price drops and in this drop the public would have been selling off But somebody was accumulating all of the ounces that the public was selling off.  And you see a tiny bit of correlation right in here where the price is falling and the number of ounces is falling.  And there's obviously correlation here where the price is rising and the number of ounces is rising.  But then that correlation stops again, and the public would have been selling off during this time period, and some entity is picking up the slack, and now that entity is still buying when the public is buying.  Now, one of the things I want to point out to you is there's these big accumulations and this big divestment going on right here.  here, and there's a little blip in the price right here.  There wasn't much going on with the price here, but there's this little blip in the price here.  That is called the Buffett blip.  This is when Warren Buffett accumulated, he purchased, 129.7 million ounces of silver.  And if you notice, this on the repositories here, it's only like 100 million ounces or so here.  There's almost 200 million ounces here.  And then Warren Buffett, when the price rose, he stood for delivery, meaning that instead of settling his commodities exchange contracts, the futures, In cash, he was asking for the actual physical silver, 129 million ounces of them.  And what you see here is that the number of ounces on the exchanges starts to fall.  Now, this is before SLV.  So this is mostly the COMEX and so on.  This is falling, and it's falling dramatically by over 100 million ounces.  I mean, let's take a look here.  Let me see.  So there's the amount of ounces that it fell.  And I've got to try and line that up.  And we'll line this up.  So it fell from here to here.  And that is greater.  That's about 129 million.  million ounces that was taken off of the exchanges and put into private custody when Warren Buffett was asking for his physical silver.  One person.  And what was interesting is this didn't appear in the Berkshire Hathaway statements and reports until this was going to be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  And so they put it in their reports that they had asked for this.  And they had offered, you know, if you just do an internet search on Buffett silver or Warren Buffett silver, and if you want to put in blip in there and there's articles that you can read about this, it's rather fascinating, but he actually did manipulate the silver market back then, much more so than the Hunt brothers and the evidence.  You know, what happened, this is zooming in on the price from 1997 through the end of 1998.  And this is the effect that Warren Buffett had on the price.  He took it from the mid $4 range up to over $7.  One person taking a tiny fraction that had been included with their petty cash.  It was that little of a fraction of the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Now, I'm going to move on and show you something that I find, it's just a question I have.  Why is this happening?  Now, when you look at the gold holdings, so you saw these lines of the monthly transparent silver holdings that Nick Laird of goldchartsrus.com Go to his website.  You might want to subscribe.  He's a great guy, and all he does is just collect enormous amounts of data, and then he updates all of these charts every week or every month, some of them every day.  So he's the one where all of this information comes from, and it's great information.  But this line of the accumulation, this is a whole bunch of different reports that he's compiling.  And here they all are.  These are all the different vaults and exchanges that are reported.  that total that one line.  And what you see here, is this huge area.  here is GLD, the exchange traded fund for gold.  And this blue area is the commodities exchange.  And the distance here is the amount of ounces on GLD at any given time.  And what you see is that the distance today has shrunk greatly from back when gold was rising in 2010, 2011.  And retail investors didn't start divesting themselves of it until 2013.  They started dumping ounces, and this area here shrank quite a bit.  And you also see that the amount on the commodities exchange, the COMEX, has also shrunk during that time period.  Now when you look at silver, something is up with silver, just like last week's video, what's up with silver?  Something is definitely up with silver.  You take a look at this one, and what you see is that SLV, if you look at the distance from here to here, it's less than the distance from here to here.  so it's shrunk a little bit.  the retail investors or you know there might be some.  it should have shrunk more than this because it fell more than gold did but it didn't.  so there's probably some entity accumulating there.  but when you look on the comex the commodities exchange Look at that increase.  That's where all of this, you know, the manipulation of that single line of the number of ounces in transparent silver holdings on those other charts, that's the cumulative amount of all of these lines together, all of these different entities.  And, you know, Nick Laird just does this spectacular job of putting all this stuff together.  It's worth everybody trying to figure all this out, but something has changed.  Silver is definitely undervalued and there's some big entity or entities that realize this, that have been trading and they have taken advantage advantage of the public's trading habits.  And they've been picking up the slack.  when the public loses interest, they've been buying when nobody else wants to buy.  when it's the unloved category, when it's something that the retail investor wants to dump, there's somebody out there that's the buyer.  And now they're buying even while the retail investors are buying.  So I think we're in for something spectacular.  I really wish and hope that there would be a little bit further respite.  I would like to accumulate even more silver before something hits the fan.  But one of the things that I do want to say is, is that for years and years, you know, I'd speak on stage or there would be a question and answer and somebody would go, when do you think this is going to happen?  When is gold going to explode?  When is silver going to explode?  When are the markets going to crash?  And I could never really answer that.  I don't know.  I just know that there's an inevitability to all of these things.  But answering exactly when the markets are going to tank and gold and silver are going to explode, I don't think there's anybody on the planet that's quite that smart or that intuitive.  But the thing is, back in 2009, my business partner pointed out to me, Mike, they're not asking you when the markets are going to crash.  What they're really asking you is, well, when is the last minute that I can come in and buy my gold and silver?  I want to stay invested in the regular investments, in the stock markets, and in bonds, and in this and that, and my real estate.  but I don't want to invest in gold right now, so can you tell me exactly when I'm supposed to invest in gold and  silver?\".  Well, the answer is now, because if you wait, it becomes too late.  In the crash of 08, the global financial crisis, the spot price of gold and silver went way down, and you could buy gold and silver cheap during that crash for a couple of months.  It went down until October, and then it turned around, and the markets kept on crashing until the following March.  uh and so and gold and silver did take off like rockets after that but the price of physical sword while the spot price of futures was falling.  so if you wanted to buy paper gold and silver yes you could buy it cheap.  but there was a. i had a friend that went into a dealer in chicago And he had very little silver left.  Everybody was running out of it during that period of time.  Gold and silver, none of the retail stores had it available.  And when silver was below $9, he was selling 100-ounce bars at a price that was $18 per ounce.  And on eBay, the price of Silver Eagles soared.  It didn't go down.  So you don't want to wait for those periods of high volatility where suddenly everybody wants it.  even if the paper price is crashing.  You want to have it when nobody else loves it.  You want to own it when nobody else wants it.  That's when you want to have it.  So that's my take this week on gold and silver, and I think there really is something up with silver.
