            "text": "Right or wrong, mental health is becoming a big issue in 2019.  We've got young people who are calling themselves the generation of anxiety.  We've got suicides galore.  We've got people who are broken, who are hurting, who have anxiety, depression.  It's becoming a big problem.  Let's be honest.  Just be honest with me.  And even in Christian circles, even Christians today are struggling with mental health issues.  And some Christians say, well, they shouldn't.  They shouldn't struggle with them.  They just need to have the joy of the Lord.  But I'll tell you, that can be very unhelpful at times.  I myself looking at you right now is a man who struggled with mental health issues, with thoughts of self-loathing, with thoughts where I would just hate myself, real self-hatred.  You know, I could be at a Christian meeting, a committee meeting, and we'd be talking about different youth issues.  We'd be talking about implementing youth strategies, how to grow a branch.  I'd be surrounded with pastors, with evangelists, with youth evangelists.  And then I'd go for a bathroom break.  I'd walk to the toilet and I'm left on my own for a few seconds in a toilet.  And these thoughts just come flooding into me, just come washing into me.  You're nothing, Joe.  You're a piece of rubbish, Joe.  Oh, I hate you.  I hate myself.  I hate myself.  in my head you know i can still.  i could walk you down this street right now and show you a place where i would have really deeply suicidal thoughts where i would walk to a library every single day and i'd see different objects different things graphic thoughts of how i could hurt myself how i could damage myself because there was so much pain there was so much hatred for myself in my heart and I don't know about you.  maybe this is something completely foreign to you.  maybe you've never ever had these feelings before but I'm telling you these feelings are difficult.  these feelings hurt.  like David said in Psalm 31 I am like a broken vessel like a smashed piece of pottery.  that's what you feel like useless good for nothing.  Now before I tell you how the Lord healed my mind from this broken record, from these repetitive thoughts, let me take you to Scripture.  You've got a Bible there, turn to Psalm 139.  In verse 13 it says, \"'For you formed my inner parts, you knitted me together in my mother's womb.  I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully  made.'\".  Now, I know that there's a lot of people who watch this channel and you've got different gifts.  You've got different careers.  Some of you are artists.  You're great painters.  Some of you are carpenters.  You could build a table with wood and nails and make it look beautiful.  Some of you are engineers.  Some of you are mechanics.  Some of you are web designers.  Some of you are influencers.  Some of you are authors.  You've all got gifts, haven't you?  Now I want you to imagine that you've been working on a project for nine months.  You've grafted, you've grinded, you've been working so hard on this beautiful project.  And then when the project was finished, nine months in, or years in after you've worked on this project, suddenly, Someone starts to call the project, someone starts to trash talk, starts to rip into it, to call it names, to say, oh, it's disgusting, it's rubbish, it's a waste of space.  How would you feel towards that person?  You'd be pretty upset, you'd be pretty hurt.  You might even be a little bit angry that this person is bad-mouthing your project.  Even worse, if someone started to damage your project, how would you feel about that?  you'd feel pretty upset, wouldn't you?  And likewise, friends, did you know this?  The God of the universe knitted you together in a womb for nine months.  And you know, I'm making this video at quite an interesting time.  My wife is 41 weeks pregnant.  She's now resting upstairs in her bed now.  And any day, our baby is going to come.  Any day we're going to have a little child walking on planet Earth who God, for nine months, has been knitting together in the womb, has been making its spleen, has been making its bones, its spine, its eyes, its eyelids.  All of it, God is working it together perfectly.  And if anyone calls that child ugly, if anyone hurts that child, God is going to be upset.  God is going to be angry.  So friends, let me tell this about you yourself.  No man, no woman, no person on planet Earth can say that you are useless, that you're stupid, that you're a waste of space.  Because God made you.  God made you and he thinks the world of you.  So no one has the right to tell you that you are ugly.  No one has the right to tell you that you are unintelligent, that you're stupid, that you're pathetic, that you're a waste of space.  No man can do that.  No woman can do that.  And let me tell you this, friends.  You yourself cannot do that.  You yourself cannot self-love because God loves you.  He delights in you, the word of God tells us.  And so friends, when you yourself are showing self-hatred, when you are getting angry at yourself, you have no right to do that because God delights in you and God has made you.  And I believe someone needs to hear that today.  Someone needs to remember that there is a God who loves them deeply.  Let me tell you this friends, no one on planet Earth has the right to say that no one loves me.  Did you know that friends?  No one can say there's no one on planet Earth, there's no one who loves me.  Why?  Because the God of the universe loves you deeply.  Just look at the cross, friends.  Look at Jesus Christ, the great lengths he went to, where he was spat on, where he had a crown of thorns on his skull, where he took the spiritual suffering for your sin on the cross.  No one can say, no one loves me, because God loves you deeply.  And he went to great lengths to show you that great love, that God demonstrates his own love to us, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.  So friends, stop it.  Stop it right now.  Stop calling yourself names.  Stop hating yourself and start remembering that God really loves you.  Now, let me just say a word of caution here, because I think this, people could misinterpret what I'm saying.  You know, there's a lot of preaching, shall we call it preaching, that is all about me, me, myself, and I, the health and wealth, the prosperity gospel, where people say, you know, I'm amazing, I fill myself up with all these different things.  That's not what I'm trying to say.  We shouldn't go away from this video and say, yes, I love myself, I'm amazing, I've done this, this, and this.  We don't love ourselves because of our accomplishments.  We love, we love the fact that God loves us.  That's why we're here today.  That's why I've made this video, that I want you to rejoice today, to get rid of these self-loathing thoughts and trade them for the thought that, wow, the God of the universe loves me.  I am fearfully and wonderfully made.  There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ.  So I need to stop condemning myself.  I need to stop letting Satan, the accuser of the brethren, put these thoughts into my mind and I need to start rejoicing in the God who delights in me.  And that should make me rejoice that there's a God who loves me, who made me, who sent his son Jesus Christ to bleed and die on a cross for me.  I did say to you, I did say that I'd tell you how I beat these self-loathing thoughts.  Or rather I should say God beat them.  In June this year, I got quite a nasty health scare and I had to be sent off for an urgent scan.  You know what it's like when you've had one of these things where something comes into your life and you think, wow, this is serious, this is going to change everything.  And I honestly thought I was going to die.  and i remember that that night to try and take my mind off things me and my wife we went to the cinemas and as i was in the cinema i just kept seeing men and women with with gray hair not even that old you know like late 50s 60s and i was looking at those people and i was thinking wow isn't it a gift for god to give a man or woman 60 years on earth?  Isn't that amazing for God to give you life?  And suddenly I didn't self-love my life.  Suddenly I didn't hate my life anymore.  Suddenly I thought, this is a gift that my heart is beating now.  This breath that I'm breathing right now is a gift from God.  And every single bit of life that you were given is precious.  So friends, that was enough for me, for me to realise that.  Look at someone with grey hair and think, yeah, that's a gift.  Life is a gift.  Let's rejoice because the Bible says, he who has the Son has life.  So let's enjoy the lives that God's given us, that we might look forward to the greater life, the eternal life, with the Son of God, the one who rose from the dead and who loves us very, very deeply.  God bless you all.  If you are new to the channel, please do consider subscribing.  We'd love to have your fellowship here at Off The Curb Ministries.  Thank you for watching. ",
