            "text": "The time has come for us to talk about the sitcom Married With Children.  Though it was primarily concerned with the mating habits of heterosexuals, or lack thereof, the show touched on LGBT life now and then with surprising sensitivity.  And even more surprisingly, it went so far as to air an episode featuring two married gay men, just two months before a real-life lawsuit kicked off the modern marriage equality movement.  All aboard and welcome to Matt Baume's Culture Cruise, where we take a deep dive on LGBT themes and the entertainment we love.  This month we're heading to Chicago for, believe it or not, Married with Children.  Which you might not expect to be particularly gay, but it has some startling links to queer culture, marriage equality, and characters that at times display more accepting attitudes than some of the characters on The Golden Girls.  Culture Cruise is made possible by everyone who pledges their support on Patreon.  Folks like Samantha Owens, thanks Samantha, head over to Patreon.com slash Matt Baume or click the link in the description to join the folks who make the show possible.  Married with Children aired for ten years, from the late 80s to the late 90s, and was basically about a nuclear family totally unable to function in modern society.  Al, the dad, is a slob who thinks he deserves everyone's respect despite doing nothing to earn it.  His wife Peg is lazy, their kids are gross, and every episode is basically a reminder of what John Waters warned us about in the movie Female Trouble.  I'm worried that you'll work in an office, have children, celebrate wedding anniversaries.  The world of heterosexual is a sick and boring life.  In the 1990 episode The Dance Show, Peg is feeling neglected, and she wants to go out.  Let's go to the movies.  I know one we'd both enjoy.  It's Shirley MacLaine, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, and Sally Struthers in Woody Allen's Oh My Head.  I know that movie's made up for the show, but I can't stop thinking about how great it would be if it was real.  Anyway, Al's disinterested in Peg, so she goes out dancing with her friend Marcy.  Played, by the way, by Amanda Bierce, an actress who later came out publicly as a lesbian.  They head to a dance club.  that is truly bizarre.  Everyone's dressed like they're at a PTA meeting, the music is like something out of the 40s, and the neon sign on the wall says Ten Cents a Dance?  What is this place?  A few months ago, I talked about how the show Kate and Ally imagined that a gay dance looked something like this.  So I really have no idea what going out even was for adults in the 1980s.  Anyway, Peg starts dancing with a pleasant man named Andy.  If he looks familiar, that's because he's played by Sam McMurray, who's been approximately eight billion different guest characters on various sitcoms over many decades.  And not to go on too much of a tangent, but three years before this episode aired, he was in a short film entitled Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall, which imagined that businessmen close deals while dancing romantically with each other.  That short actually won an Oscar, which was presented by Pee Wee Herman, and he was attacked during the ceremony by the evil robot from RoboCop and flew to safety in the rafters of the theater, which isn't in any way relevant to this episode.  I just want you to know about it so you'll have weird dreams tonight.  Anyway, back to the show.  Al is unconcerned that Peg has been dancing with another man.  His only worry is that he can't feed himself and is starting to get hungry.  But then there's a knock at the door.  I just think you ought to know that your wife has been seeing my husband.  Hey, it's Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson.  He plays Pete, the husband of Andy, the man Peg's been dancing with.  What's interesting here is that while marriage equality wasn't legally recognized anywhere in the world at this point, the show repeatedly uses the term husband to describe the couple.  You're a husband? ",

            "text": "In 1991, there was no definitive legal status for same-sex relationships.  A handful of towns offered limited recognition, but if you traveled outside of city limits, that legal recognition would likely evaporate.  Many same-sex couples used terms like husband and wife even without the legal status, which often just confused heterosexuals.  So it's surprisingly progressive that the show Married with Children didn't bat an eye.  Al doesn't care that this guy is gay, which is nothing short of amazing given the time.  In the 1980s, homophobia was TV's hackiest punchline, and Married with Children thrived on hacky jokes.  In fact, here's how the show handled a gay character on an episode a year earlier.  OK, two things.  First, you don't call us queens.  We call ourselves queens, because we're amazing.  And second, this guy's look is absolute perfection.  He's doing Peach Bowser cosplay and nailing the look.  So yes, queen, obviously.  Anyway, it's noteworthy that Al isn't thrown by the use of the term husband, since the world was still about a decade away from any country having full marriage equality.  In fact, the year this episode aired, 1990, marked an important milestone in the fight for the freedom to marry.  For literally years, queer activists have been arguing about whether they should even pursue marriage equality at all.  A lot of activists thought that marriage would harm queer people.  Just look at how the institution is portrayed on this show.  Patriarchal, unsatisfying, anachronistic, mired in the past.  Many community leaders thought that queer people could do better than marriage.  But the HIV epidemic exposed a crucial lack of legal protection for LGBTQ relationships.  When partners died, often they had no legal connection to each other, which left them vulnerable to predatory family or laws that penalized them for being unwed.  So over time, it became clear that it was crucial to be radically critical of the institution of marriage while also recognizing the need for legal equality.  That strategy started to take shape in 1989, when courts in New York and California issued rulings that same-sex couples could be recognized as families.  Then in December of 1990, just two months after this episode aired, three couples applied for marriage licenses in Hawaii.  And by the way, you can read their amazing personal accounts of how all that happened in my book, Defining Marriage, now available on Amazon.  The Hawaii couples established the foundation for all the legal work that happened over the ensuing quarter century.  that led up to the Supreme Court's ruling in 2015 legalizing marriage equality nationwide.  The entire legal strategy that eventually won started here.  Well, not here on Married with Children, but at this particular moment in time.  And this wasn't the only episode of TV grappling with the issue.  A year earlier, in 1989, the Golden Girls revealed that Blanche's brother was gay.  And two years later, in 1991, her brother decided to get married, an idea that was met with some confusion.  In the span of just two years, the Golden Girls went from showing gays coming out to gays wanting their relationships recognized.  Other shows did the same thing, and even went further.  Also in 1991, the sitcom Rock aired TV's first same-sex commitment ceremony.  By the way, I've been searching for that episode everywhere, and I can't find it.  It must exist, so if you have a copy, please get in touch.  So here we have Al, an icon of heterosexuality, and he totally doesn't care that Pete's gay.  In fact, he kind of likes it.  He treats Pete nicely, and he's sort of into him. ",
