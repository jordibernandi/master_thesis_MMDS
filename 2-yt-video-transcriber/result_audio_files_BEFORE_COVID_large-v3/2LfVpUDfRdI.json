            "text": "Good morning, good morning, Big Square.  RoadToRooter.com.  We are basically at a point now where there are no plans to fix the system.  Later today, I'm going to be posting a debate I had with Bitcoin Ben at the Litecoin Summit.  at the RoadToRooter party, where we debate, is there going to be a crash or a smooth transition?  This is not going to be smooth.  Problem with the smooth transition is you don't fix any problem at all.  And the same problems will be there.  There's no way to get rid of the derivative bubble.  You can't turn it into cryptos, tokens.  It just isn't being done.  First of all, it's not being done.  The derivative bubble is growing exponentially.  while crypto market is growing like this.  So obviously, obviously, I hope everybody could see that.  There's no way that the cryptos will take out the old system in any smooth manner.  The cryptos are for the future after the crash.  The crash will be an ending of the old system.  It may be in a day, it may be in a week, but it's not gonna slowly go down, bounce around the bottom and then restart.  It doesn't solve the problem.  What's going to happen is the computer trading models are going to start fighting each other and lock up.  The Dow will shut down.  All stock markets, bond market will shut down.  Comics, LBMA, all crypto markets will shut down.  And it would be a moment.  It would be a moment in time.  I don't know that day.  That's the day that they pull the plug on this entire system.  Cliff is calling 2020 year zero because that's the data is coming back from the inner workings of the government where Cliff has the spiders running.  It's coming back.  They're calling 2020 year zero, probably year zero for the new financial system.  I do believe that we hit the all-time high in the Dow on Tuesday, the close on Tuesday, over 28,000.  28,090 was the number.  It will go to zero.  It's not going to go to 100,000, 200,000.  We're not going to see that type of hyperinflation because it doesn't fix the problem.  And right now, there's no plans to fix it.  There's no plans at all.  So... How do you survive this?  You have assets in your own possession.  Obviously, silver in your own possession.  Silver's just hovering around.  Remember, they can click a mouse and rig the silver price.  Look what JP Morgan did to the silver price over the last 10 years.  And there is no dispute anymore that this was going on.  There are, what, six people who have been indicted from JP Morgan for doing just this.  Now, this is the silver market, the global silver market.  How easy is it to rig a market when you control the derivative price with computers and derivatives?  It's easy.  They drove the price from $20 to $50 when they put Bill Daley in as Obama's chief of staff.  And then they drove the price down and they control the price every day.  Not once in a while, every single day.  And that will end.  It probably won't end on the comics with the comics saying, oh, silver's gone to $1,000 today.  No, the comics would shut down instantly.  Every dollar that silver goes up, the bad guys, a small handful of banks that control the price, lose a billion dollars because they have a billion ounce short position.  So no, it's not going to go to $1,000 on the comics.  The comics will shut down.  It might not happen today.  It might say, okay, we're going to pause trading.  And then, okay, we're going to halt trading.  We're going to, They can do all kinds of bullshit.  It's their game.  They play by their rules.  You need to get silver off.  Any exchanges, no ETFs, no mining shares.  My God.  Please, I hope by now you don't have any mining shares.  All of that will be nationalized in an instant.  And you don't even own them.  They're rehypothecated.  The shares you think you own, 10 people own the exact same shares.  I've been talking about that a long time.  And then cryptos, again, rigged.  Christian Carl told us it's rigged.  They rig it every day, every trade and every day.  It's so easy.  The crypto market is tiny.  A click of a mouse, you can rig it higher, rig it lower.  The latest excuse is this.  Bitcoin mining capitulation is here at last.  Will prices react?  Dreaded run from a Bitcoin miner.  capitulation arrived at the same time as spotted by Charles Edwards, a cryptocurrency analyst.  The hash ribbons, an indicator tracking the health of Bitcoin's network hash rate, has finally seen a bearish crossover or inversion after days and weeks of anticipation.  This could have a strong effect on the cryptocurrency market for, if history rhymes, potentially depressing the price for the next few weeks, maybe even months.  So the frick what?  They can blame anything they want.  They can click a mouse and drive it and then say, hey, the reason the cryptos went down is because Trump and China are not going to agree on a deal.  They can say anything they want.  It's all bullshit.  They rig it with a click of a mouse.  They can rig it higher.  They can rig it lower.  The exchanges are ridiculous.  The volumes are ridiculous.  Let's see how much Litecoin traded in the last 24 hours.  Oh, look at that.  $3 billion worth of Litecoin traded in the last 24 hours.  And there's only $3.2 billion worth of Litecoin that's ever been mined in the history of Litecoin.  Total and complete bullshit.  All these numbers are ridiculous.  They are a fraud.  What is the price, true fair market value of Bitcoin and Litecoin?  Nobody knows.  Nobody knows.  They aren't freely traded.  They're traded with derivatives and computers and rigging.  Massive manipulation of the crypto markets, just like all other markets.  Why do we even play in it?  Because we know that when the old system crashes and stops functioning, we're going to need a new form of money.  That's where Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and many others will jump in and say, hey, instead of bailing out these banks, why not try a new alternative that is not in any way associated with the banking system?  That's the plan.  And do the banks know what's going to happen?  In a bizarre admission, the EZB warns its policies threaten financial stability.  Could lead to a crash.  The number one rule in central banking is to not cause panic.  To play the fraud.  Alan Greenspan talked through his ass the whole time.  Lie, cheat, steal.  It's all a confidence game.  That's all it is.  The entire system is built on confidence.  So what does this tell me?  That the ECB warns that its policies are threatening financial stability?  It means they want to crash the system.  Like I said, there is no plan to fix the system, only a plan to crash the system.  What day will it happen?  I think soon.  Where should you be situated?  You need to get out of everything.  Stop looking at the price of Bitcoin.  Stop looking at the price of silver.  The future is not going to be in the price in US dollars.  The future is going to be in how many ounces do you own?  How many ounces of silver do you own?  How many Litecoin do you have on your wallet?  Or in storage, shall we say.  That's the future, not, oh, my investment went down.  I'm going to make a whole bunch of money by selling my Bitcoin now and buying back when it hits $4,500.  Well, the problem is you're not going to be able to buy it back.  When the system shuts down, the system shuts down.  It's like the music stopping in musical chairs.  All of a sudden, it's whatever you're holding is what you got, and there ain't no crying about it.  There's no crying in baseball.  Because there's nothing you can do about it.  All these institutions that are holding the money, all the Coinbase and Gemini and Kraken and every other ridiculous exchange will be shut down.  Get it in your own possession.  It has to be in your own possession now.  Now is the most important time.  I'll be doing an update on the repos today for private road members.  So yes, oh, by the way, because Veritasium dropped back down below 20 bucks, I'm still giving away VARI.  So you haven't missed the date to get your VARI token.  Go to the subscribe today and you can get that along with the coolest silver coin ever.  And when this system shuts down, you want these assets in your possession, in your possession.  Number one is probably going to be silver because the big money doesn't understand cryptos yet.  They do understand gold and silver.  They do understand that JP Morgan was rigging the silver.  The lawsuits will be flying.  The price will be flying.  Silver will be the first to run in a freely traded market because there's 150 years of price suppression.  150 years of price suppression.  That does not end easily.  That's why Ruda right here is jumping up and down on the silver brick road.  Ruda knows what's about to happen to the prices.  I think first stop, probably $50.  Next stop, when it starts trading again, probably $100.  But then again, where are we going to see that price?  I don't know.  Because it won't be on the comics.  Silver goes up to $100.  That means the bankers lost $80 billion.  A handful of them.  Less than eight.  JP Morgan, HSBC, Deutsche Bank.  They might be gone anyway.  And Jamie Dimon is going to make a perp walk this year is my estimation.  Because everything's coming to a head in the silver investigations of JP Morgan rigging the silver market in December.  Hang on to your hats, my friend.  Join the road to Ruta and stay abreast of the information.  I will be posting the Bitcoin bin, Big Square debate later today for the whole world to watch.  And I want everybody to comment in the comment section as to who won the debate.  I threw it at the end.  I said, I'll bin you in because you got all sentimental on me.  He turned my little sentimental key.  But you guys raise your hand and comment on who you think won the debate.  It's BigSquareRoadRuta.com.  Talk to you later. ",
