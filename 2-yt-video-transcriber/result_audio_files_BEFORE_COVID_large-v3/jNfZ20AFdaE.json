            "text": "hey guys we just got some new data out in terms of the morning console releasing their quarterly approval disapproval numbers of all 100 u.s senators.  now to make this a little bit more interesting what i'm going to do is fill out a hypothetical 2020 senate map based on these incumbent senators who are in races that are currently rated as either toss-up leans or likely and if their approval numbers are higher than their disapproval we're going to be giving them the win in their re-election bid.  but if their disapproval numbers are higher then we're going to give it to the challenging party just to show you what that hypothetical senate map might look like.  so we have 14 individuals who fall under this category and then outside of that you have new mexico kansas and the special election in georgia but they don't have incumbents that are up for re-election in 2020. those are going to be open races so we're just going to leave them rated how they are.  But the other 14 seats, we're gonna go through and see where the senators are currently at.  And then obviously when I make my final Senate predictions, I'm gonna be using a lot more criteria other than simply the approval, disapproval numbers of these incumbent senators.  But it is an important piece of information to take a look at.  So we're gonna start out west, the state of Arizona, and it's Martha McSally.  She's at 37% approval, 40% who are disapproving of her.  So she's underwater by three percentage points.  I actually think that she has a tougher potential matchup here.  In 2020, going against the astronaut Mark Kelly, who's fundraised very well and has relatively strong name recognition.  In contrast to her 2018 race that she had in Arizona against Kyrsten Sinema, she fell in that one statewide, but then was appointed to the Senate seat, and now she's going to have to win it in 2020.  Not going to be easy for her, especially with her approval numbers underwater.  So that one going to the Democrats.  Moving over to Colorado.  The Republicans also have the incumbency advantage here with Cory Gardner.  He's at 37% approve, 40% who disapprove.  And he's also likely to have a very tough race here in 2020.  He's underwater by a few percentage points.  And whether he goes against the progressive Romanoff or the centrist Taken Looper, each of those individuals would present a challenge to Gardner in a statewide race in Colorado.  And since he's underwater, we're going to be giving that one as a lean over to the Democrats.  Now we're going to move up to the state of Montana.  Steve Daines, 47% approved compared to 31% who disapproved.  So pretty decent numbers there, 16 percentage points above water.  I actually think that the Democrats could have posed a significant challenge to the Republicans in this instance.  If Steve Bullock would have decided to run, of course, Bullock decided that he was going to try to go for the presidency and that didn't really get off the ground.  But then he declared after he stepped down from running for the presidency.  that he would not be running in this Senate race, so that kind of opened things up a bit more to make it a bit easier for the Republicans to win this one.  It looks like Wilmot Collins might be the challenger on the Democratic side, and he's just not as well-known in Montana, but we'll see how that race plays out.  But obviously in this instance with Dane significantly above water with his approval, we're going to be giving him that one.  Now we'll go down and take a look at Texas with John Cornyn.  44% approve compared to just 25% who disapprove, but he also has a relatively large number of people who don't have an opinion of him, which means he has relatively low name recognition, which isn't ideal for an incumbent, but still nonetheless 19 percentage points above water with his approval.  is a positive sign for Cornyn, and he doesn't have to go against Beto O'Rourke, who was the challenger to Ted Cruz in 2018, who made things very competitive.  It's going to be a situation where Cornyn goes against a Democrat who isn't as well-known as O'Rourke, which perhaps makes things a bit more manageable for him, and going to be giving that one over to the Republicans, obviously, in this instance with Cornyn above water.  Now we'll move up to the state of Iowa there in the Midwest, and that's going to be Joni Ernst.  Ernst has seen her numbers consistently take steps back over the past year or so from the morning consult, where now she's only at 37% who approve compared to 42% who disapprove.  We'll see who her challenger ends up being, but also just the fact that the Democratic Party as a whole is spending a ton of time in the states with these rallies and town halls and things with all these presidential candidates.  is probably going to be a net benefit to the party in Iowa for elections in 2020, not just on the presidential level, but in some of these other areas.  And with Joni Ernst, five percentage points underwater, we're going to be giving that one as a lean over to the challenging party, the Democrats.  Now we'll move up to Minnesota.  And this one's going to be Tina Smith.  She's at 42% approved, 29% who disapprove.  And she actually just won the special election in the 2018 midterms.  Now, she's not going to be able to ride the coattails of Amy Klobuchar, who performed very well in her reelection bid in the state of Minnesota in 2018.  So perhaps a little bit more challenging for Tina Smith this time around, but she is above water with those approval numbers.  And Minnesota in general is a lean to likely Democratic state in those statewide elections.  So now we'll move over and take a look at another Midwestern state.  This one being Michigan, and that is Gary Peters, who is the incumbent at 37% approve, 29% disapprove.  So a net positive eight percentage points.  But what's really troublesome for Peters is 34% don't have an opinion of him, which means He has very low name recognition statewide, which reduces his incumbency advantage.  And he's likely to be going against John James, who ran on the Republican side in 2018.  So able to build off a little bit more name recognition in that instance.  And actually, James performed a little bit better against Debbie Stabenow in 2018 than I thought he was going to.  He was in that one lost by about six to seven percentage points, which was a better performance than what we saw in the governor's race by quite a bit in Michigan.  in 2018.  So likely to be a relatively competitive race, but going to be giving this one to Gary Peters.  It is also worth noting that Gary Peters won his Senate race in 2014 for the Democrats, and that was a really poor year for Democratic voter turnout.  So that's something that he can put a feather in his cap on and show you that he has strength, even in a year where the Democrats had relative weakness, he was able to win statewide there.  So now we'll move it down and take a look at Kentucky.  And of course, everyone knows who the Kentucky senator is.  That is the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and pretty devastating numbers for him at 37% approved compared to 50% who disapprove.  Kind of like what we saw in the governor's race with the incumbent Republican Bevin.  who had very poor approval numbers, and he went on to lose his race as a result.  Now McConnell has won Senate races in Kentucky in the past with not great approval numbers.  We'll see how that affects him in this one, but since he's significantly underwater, we're just going to give this one as a slight lean over to the Democrats.  And again, obviously there's a lot more factors that are built into it than just approval-disapproval numbers, but that's just simply the criteria that we're going to be going on in this video.  So now we'll take a look at some of these southeastern states.  going over to Mississippi, Cindy Hyde-Smith, who won the special election race in the midterms, and she's quite a bit above water, 47% approved, 31% who disapproved, so giving that one over to the Republicans.  And then Alabama, that is a race that Doug Jones won in a special election against Roy Moore.  He's likely to go against a tougher challenger this time around.  I don't think Roy Moore is going to win the primary on the Republican side, but it's actually kind of surprising to me that a Democratic senator from Alabama, which is one of the most partisan, leaning Republican states out of all 50, actually has a Democratic senator who's above water with his approval, 41% approved, 35% who disapproved.  So in this instance, we'll be giving that one as a lean over to the Democrats.  And then with Georgia, that is going to be David Perdue.  Really strong numbers from him, 49% approved compared to 26% who disapproved.  So we're going to be giving that one over to the Republicans.  Now, if Stacey Abrams would have challenged him for this one, I think that the Democrats could possibly challenge Perdue.  Maybe Abrams decides to run for the special election, which actually would probably be a little bit more gettable than having to run against an incumbent.  We'll see how all that plays out.  Now we're going up to North Carolina, and that is Tom Tillis.  And Tillis' number's not great because he's underwater with 34% approved, 37% who disapproved, but he's also not all that well-known with 29% of people who haven't formed an opinion of him, which means his incumbency advantage isn't as strong.  But given who the Democrats have in their primary, not individuals who are all that well-known, so we'll see how that shakes out.  I don't think they're necessarily the strongest Democratic challenger in those particular instances.  We'll see what the polling has to say once we get through primary season.  But since Tillis is underwater here, we're going to be giving that one over to the Democrats.  And just a couple more seats here.  So we're going to go over to New Hampshire next.  And New Hampshire is here with Jan Shaheen.  And her numbers are looking pretty strong here.  52% approved, 37% who disapproved.  She's very well known in the state with only 11%.  who don't have an opinion of her.  Also, New Hampshire tends to lean over to the Democrats in these instances with these statewide races on the federal level.  So giving that one over to the Democrats.  And just one more state here, Maine.  And it's actually pretty devastating for the incumbent who... is going to be Susan Collins in that instance.  42% approved, but 52% who disapproved.  That is the highest number of all 100 US senators in terms of disapproval numbers.  And Collins has seen her numbers significantly backdrop over the past year or ever since the whole Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court scenario.  So Collins, she's going to be in a fight for her life if she even ends up winning the Republican primary where she's going to be challenged.  But she probably is going to go on and win that one, obviously, with a lot of name recognition there in the state.  And then whoever her Democratic challenger ends up being is going to be a tough one for Collins with her numbers net negative 10 in terms of the disapproval.  in her state of Maine.  So we'll give that one over to the Democrats as well.  So that gives us 53 seats for the Democrats and 47 for the Republicans.  And this is getting close to what would almost be a best case scenario for the Democrats, but it's definitely a positive sign for their party that so many of these incumbent Republican senators are underwater with their approval numbers, with their home constituents, which leaves the door open for the Democratic Party to challenge these Republicans particular Senate seats in a successful manner.  We'll see how all that plays out over the next year.  So I appreciate you guys stopping by consider subscribing to the YouTube channel and I hope to see you guys back here for future videos. ",
