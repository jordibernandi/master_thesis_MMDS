            "text": "So check this out.  I have seven coins here that I'm going to discuss today.  All totaling over $250,000 sold at auction.  Now the one big theme in this whole video is these coins are not lookers.  As a matter of fact, these coins have probably been spent at the gas station.  Walmart, Target, you know why?  at one point you probably threw some in some change jar somewhere or piggy bank or perhaps you lent out one of these coins to a stranger that needed a little bit of extra change so that way they can purchase something.  Just think about it for a second.  Now what we have here is what I like to call the lucky seven.  Seven undeniably ordinary looking circulated Lincoln pennies that at one point or another were subjected to just regular spending.  People held them in their pocket.  Someone actually had a coin that probably is worth $20,000 at one time in their pocket.  all right as they were going about their day and these coins right here make no mistake about it.  look they don't look new okay they they've seen.  they've seen some battles out there in uh in everyday commerce.  so the first one that you see here obviously this one is a circulation fine.  this one would came right straight out of pocket change.  it's a 1969 s Double die offers, okay, we know this as the king of modern double die coins.  This one sold back November 2nd, 2014 through Great Collections as a PCGS AU55 Brown example for $19,800.  $20,000 sitting in your pocket.  $20,000 sitting in that $100 pocketbook.  Or maybe this is a coin that was sitting on the ground somewhere or in someone's cash register.  $20,000.  It's life-changing money.  But everybody knows what this coin is.  It's iconic.  But I have six other coins out here that maybe aren't as iconic that have passed through many hands.  And we're going to take a look at every single one of them, okay?  And then the second coin right here is another iconic coin.  Believe me, they're not all going to be like this, but make no mistake about it.  The 1992 Lincoln Cent with a close AM in America on the reverse, which was, by the way, intended for a proof die.  Graded PCGS Mint State 62 Red Brown.  Obviously, this one has seen some sort of action out there in regular everyday transactions.  And this one sold on Great Collections, like the previous example.  December 3rd, 2017.  Okay, see, these are relatively recent examples within the last five to ten years.  This one brought home $8,000.  six hundred thirty eight dollars and eighty eight cents ladies and gentlemen and is it you know more life-changing money here in northern california?  that's four months of rent.  it's kind of sickening isn't it?  other parts of the country it could be maybe a full year hard to say but this is a lot of money.  again.  another coin that obviously was sitting in a bankroll or perhaps is sitting in your change jar as we speak.  now the coins that are on this lineup get more and more obscure.  you know there are certain pieces that we've never heard about.  as a matter of fact you ought to check out the number seven coin.  this.  this thing will blow your mind.  you know these are coins that don't traditionally exist.  if we don't know about them the number three coin on the list.  this one's fun.  this is a fun find right here And it's subtle.  It is oh so subtle.  It's a 1966 Lincoln scent.  Look how brown this thing is.  This thing has passed through many hands over a course of its lifetime until someone finally discovered it and saved it from sure destruction and circulation.  PCGS Mint State 62 Brown, another great collection coin.  Now what's so special about this one?  Oh, it's just a simple double die reverse.  It's an FS801.  Looking at the coin and especially on the back of the coin, you can't really tell what that double die looks like.  I had to go into my cherry pickers guide, which by the way, folks, is for sale down below in the description box through an Amazon link.  A little bit of a plug in there.  PCGS Mint State 62 Brown, sold on Great Collections back in April 30th, 2017.  Probably one of the weakest looking double dyes I've ever seen in a cherry pickers guide.  This one brought home $3,300.  All right, just the three coins right there.  We have amassed $30,000 in coins that have come out of pocket change.  All right, and so can you.  But I wanted to make you guys aware that stuff like this exists.  Now up next is a coin that probably doesn't look so much as circulated as it does something that's been beat up and damaged.  You know, this thing looks like some sort of garage experiment.  So it's a 2007D Lincoln cent.  Some of you may not know this, but this coin is a copper coated zinc planchet.  Planchet meaning blank.  It was struck on that.  When you take away the copper coating on there, it kind of looks like the coin that you see here.  Kind of that steely gray color.  That's what the zinc core is on these things.  They're very undesirable.  they're ugly and they're not worth more than the face value of the coin.  so it looks like someone drilled a hole right down the middle of this thing.  but however this one hides a little something that a lot not a lot of people know about.  it sticks to a magnet out of all things therefore excluding it as being a zinc coin.  So what we have here is a coin that is a natural born error of sorts.  This one was struck on just an errant steel washer.  This one graded PCGS Mint State 64.  This one sold August 26, 2012.  Also through Great Collections.  one brought home six thousand three hundred twenty five dollars.  okay all i'm saying is if you find a coin like this wait till you get wait till you get home take a magnet off your fridge and see if it sticks because if it sticks congratulations.  you just earned yourself five six thousand dollars.  all right.  so we can't do this kind of video without talking about the next coin a coin that will live in infamy as being The ultimate error coin in U.S.  coinage history.  It's the 1943 Lincoln Cent, which by the way, this was intended to be a steel composition coin.  It's supposed to stick to a magnet.  But this one right here clearly looks like it's been around a block.  There was a coin much like this that sold just recently.  It was actually the discovery coin that was actually handed back in change in a school cafeteria, discovered by a young kid who was probably 14, 15 years old, set it aside, and it was sold after he passed away many, many decades ago, or later.  This one right here is a 43S, so it's a San Francisco.  This one was inadvertently struck on a bronze planchet.  A bronze planchet being that it's not steel, but the bronze planchet coins existed in 42, 44, and any other date around 1943.  This one graded PCGS VF35.  This thing has been through many thousands of hands over the course of its lifetime.  This one sold on Heritage Auctions February 4th, 2010.  And get this, sold for $207,000.  Woo!  Good stuff, good stuff.  I don't know if I'll ever find something like this in my lifetime, but I do know about it and I'm actively looking for it when I'm going through my change.  But that's the top end coin, but we have two other ones, okay?  There's another coin right here, the sixth coin on the list of the lucky seven.  It's a 1983 Lincoln penny.  As you guys know, the U.S.  Mint stopped producing pennies on bronze planchet coins, blanks.  In 1983, the new composition was a copper-coated zinc.  Lighter in weight, cheaper, more self-destructive.  However, this 1983 discovered right here was indeed struck on one of those leftover bronze planchets from 1982.  This one, of course, you have to weigh.  It has to weigh above 3 grams for it to have any shot at it being the actual transitional error.  This one graded AnnexAU58 Details.  It's got some roller damage, which indicates that this coin at one point was a roll ender.  From a bankroll.  How crazy is that?  It's just sitting there staring at you in your face.  And what we have here is a $4,000 coin.  That's how much this one sold September 9th, 2018.  It hasn't even been a year yet from Great Collections.  $4,050.  You guys see the big picture?  It doesn't have to be a brand new coin for it to be valuable.  You just need to know what you're looking at.  It's all an education.  Coin collecting is a little overwhelming to new folks that don't know a lot about it.  We know we like to spend money and make money, but actually taking a close look at your money is a completely different horse of a different color.  So the final coin is going to strike you guys as kind of odd, if not a little bit cool, radical, awesome, stupendous, phenomenal.  Believe it or not, this is a 1961D Lincoln Memorial scent.  Would you guys believe that this was struck on an already produced 1960D small date scent?  If you look close enough at the photos, you'll be able to see the second date in there.  It's actually in Lincoln's jacket.  This thing is off the chain.  I've never seen one quite like this.  But obviously it's circulated.  It's passed through many hands.  This rare oddity that you see here has passed through many hundreds if not thousands of fingertips.  So this one graded out PCGS AU58.  It sold through Heritage Auctions.  May 11, 2007.  So it's been a little while, but I'm happy to say there's been a few other examples that have sold since that point.  about four thousand six hundred dollars i would venture to guess this is a ten thousand dollar coin today.  because uh this thing sold for too little money before the coin market was heading up.  so someone knew what they had and someone got a bargain a steal of a deal.  but it'd be different if we all found these okay.  these are seven absolute lucky coins that were saved the everyday turbulence of being thrown around a cash register or a change machine or like the instance in that 1983 bronze scent it was subjected to damage from a roller machine at the bank or the armored car company and it's all out there for the taking 253 000 total Between seven coins, all discovered in circulation.  And guess what?  There's more to be found, ladies and gentlemen.  I wanted to inspire you to look for these.  You know, you don't have to actively go out and buy the rolls, but at least know what you're looking at.  Every single one of these seven coins are different in some way.  Okay, I didn't talk about seven 1969S double dies, although it could have been very easy to do such.  But these coins right here, these are coins that dreams are made of.  These can make a difference in our lives.  Money does not run our lives, but sometimes it helps to have a passageway, so to speak, to make our lives a little bit easier.
