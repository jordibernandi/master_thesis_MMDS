And Bill, I know it's painful for you to do so because we just did an episode yesterday about the transcript that's been released, that President Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky.  Today, though, Bill, I want to take a completely different focus, which you unwittingly segued nicely to at the end of the previous episode.  So if you need to, ladies and gentlemen, stop the tape right here on your Betamax and go and look at yesterday's show first and then watch this one, although they can be watched completely out of order with no impact whatsoever.  So here's the issue, Bill. ",

Now, I don't want to dwell on that so much, although we can talk a little bit about it.  But the real issue is, Bill, with an impeachment inquiry going on and then possibly the filing of articles of impeachment and then possibly a trial in the Senate over these articles of impeachment, how does...

We don't feel that this man is a man of unimpeachable moral character or of extremely sophisticated manners and grooming.  We understand what Donald Trump is.  We understand what his flaws are.  But Donald Trump is the first politician in the modern age to understand that the enemy of this country is not Russia.  It's not China.  The enemy of this country is an elite group of individuals who think they get to decide what the American people can hear and not hear.  It's people in the news media.  It's people in the Democratic Party.  And if it weren't for the Internet, we would be having President Clinton's second term now or first term, Hillary's first term of endless terms of endless terms.  This is what Donald Trump is for.  This is what he's built for.  It's what he's constructed for.  And we found him.  in a rusty old dump someplace in the back of a garbage heap mounted called The Apprentice.  And we found this guy, he found us really mutually.  And we realized that this guy who had an understanding of television and an understanding of media, had understanding especially of Democrats having done New York deals, in real estate an understanding of how low people can go to get what they want.  and this man rose up and the american people rose to meet him and elected him to stop this this ongoing just endless determination on the part of the left to not only tell people what to do but when they get up on their hind legs and don't do what they tell them what to do like like donald trump.  let's say then to make sure that they not only punish the american people for the next four years but maintain an absolute incessant flow of constant disinformation, trying to undermine the credibility of the man elected as president by the American people.

Donald Trump was elected by unlikely voters.  And that is the fundamental issue.

But it's about, quote, the integrity of our democracy, respect for the rule of law, and defending our Constitution.

But I got to tell you, if after two years of Mueller and these serious accusations of collusion come up, blank, then it's gonna be a lot harder to convince the average American that this isn't a witch hunt.  And let me add one thing that's very important to this.  I suspect that Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi are gonna deeply regret throwing this boomerang because I suspect that what is going to emerge as with the Mueller report is not only Donald Trump is not guilty, But that the people who were involved in making him look guilty are in fact guilty of serious felony crimes and belong in jail.

And furthermore, I am going to absolutely determine to lead a charge into looking into the investigation.  I want to find out what happened after this thing settles and Donald Trump is not impeached from office because that is the outcome that's going to happen.  I don't think there's a Republican out there, and God knows I think these are largely very spineless people.  But on this one, there is so little evidence.  that this, even if it did happen, that it's an impeachable offense, that I think even Republicans, politicians, are gonna stick with the president on this one.  It's not like Watergate where you had the president guilty On tape.  And it's not like a Clinton gate either, where you had the president on tape lying on camera.  They have no evidence and it's not and he's not guilty.  So there you go.  I would stand by him.  And the more I stood by him, the better it would go.  And I get final piece of advice to Nancy Pelosi here.  You know, if you're going to old, old, old adage in power politics.  But if you're going to try and if you're going to try and shoot the king, you better kill him.  You know, you'd better kill them.  They're taking pot shots over their shoulder.  And somebody who I like and admire very much once told me a story about a guy who pushed a gun up against another guy's chest and said, I feel it's only fair to warn you, sir, that at this range, I seldom miss.  And if you're going to take down the president of the United States, you better have a gun with six rounds in it and you better have it pressed up against his eyeball.  Because if you fire that weapon and you miss and they're going to miss, then you are going to regret that decision in a very big way. ",
