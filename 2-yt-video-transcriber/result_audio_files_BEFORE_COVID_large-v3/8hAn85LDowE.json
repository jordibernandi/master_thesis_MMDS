Her and three other teachers was pictured holding a noose.  And as you can see on this picture, they're laughing about it.  They're having a great time with a symbol of terrorism.  that was enacted on us as a everyday thing just because the Ku Klux Klan wanted to do so.  And that is still happening to black people today.  It is happening so much so that anytime a black man is hung, the police is in on it and saying, Oh, it's a suicide.  We all know black people don't commit suicide that way.  and sure that we won't be tying no nooses.  We don't even know how to do that.  That's things from their history.  And yet we don't get the FBI involved.  We don't do our own things to end that practice.  But let's go ahead and roll this clip. ",

            "text": "Now, let's talk about what it is.  The majority of the teachers in this country are Caucasian female.  That's done by design.  It's not that African American women or men don't want to teach.  No, it's not that.  all is done by design to keep a control.  We need teachers from our community teaching our children because when they teach our children at the age of 10, especially if you are a black boy, they view you as adult like in nature.  And that comes from the American psychological association back in 2014. law enforcement, look at black children at the age of 10, especially the black boy as adult like in nature.  But when it comes to the white one, Oh, he's still a kid.  They'll call a 25 year old a kid.  But our children, he's a man.  This is what they say.  Cause they don't view our kids the same way because it's a lot of inherent racial bias that's in them to do so.  And I told you guys, the majority of people who are racist are not in the Ku Klux Klan.  They're not in the alt right.  They're not a neo Nazi.  They're not any kind of white nationalists.  They're not.  They're working every day at the school.  They're working at Walmart.  When you go into different restaurants, they're there.  You go into the hospitals, they're there.  They're everywhere in America.  Just letting you know this.  It's a very, very sick mentality.  Now, you heard the way the parents respond to this.  In this school, there's hardly no teachers that have any kind of color to them.  Now you heard the one parent say, Hey, she wanted her child to be with the black teacher.  Why would she say that?  Not to say the black teacher is smarter, but the fact is at least with the black teacher, I don't have to worry about racism with the black teacher.  That's why.  Why are you getting offended for?  You don't like black people.  Like I don't understand that then this school is made up.  a third of the school is black and a third of the school is Hispanic.  So you got people at the school, that's making up probably the majority of the people there.  And yet you have this attitude and you think in playing with news is fun and so-called liberal California.  Let me tell you about California.  California has a lot of racism there.  Don't you sit up there and think, oh, it's a blue state.  You don't have any problems.  You would think that.  But no, it's a lot of strong, cold racism.  But let me tell you something.  You see, I've heard some people say, oh, the South, let me tell you, Malcolm X said this, and I go with Malcolm X say more than anybody else.  He said anything south of Canada is the South, meaning the whole United States is the South.  And that's the truth.  Because why is it you say this happening in Alabama or whatever?  And I say don't, but you don't supposed to expect that to happen in a California.  It's happened in New York to the state to have the strong liberal policies.  But I told people in a day, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative is all white supremacy.  And you just got one that treats you maybe a little different and one's more harsh.  That's it.  How is it that we as black parents send us kids to school for this?  And let me tell you something else is bad.  That principal was being considered to take over as superintendent and this how she feels.  I want to know the disciplinary record for black children at that school.  I'd like to know that, especially the black boys.  Because when you feel that way, I don't like to see the grades of those black children.  I like it because they're not gonna treat you right.  Especially you holding the news and it's funny to you.  I mean, it's sick.  It's very sick.  And I've told you guys many times before, you sit up here and talk about the racist Caucasian man, but you don't ever speak about the woman.  The woman is the first teacher of the child, not the man.  That's who's nurturing that racism in the children early.  But nobody talks about that.  These women are participating in racism, white supremacy.  They backed a man up with that too politically and whatever else they back them up on. ",

            "text": "But unfortunately in our community, we got some people that do anything to hurt us, male or female, because they don't code with white supremacy.  They understand that's the greatest system ever for them.  Why do they want to give that up?  My thing is the obsession with the hatred obsessed.  Like I can live my life just trying to think of new ways or not even new ways.  They don't have no new tricks.  There's always trying to hate on this one group of people.  Like that's stupid.  That's so that's dumb.  My thing is, that's why I say this high like you, they say they have you taking pictures with a noose.  Eventually somebody going to leak it.  Somebody's going to pass something out to the internet and, Your high like you didn't figure that out.  I'm just saying, I mean it's like, it's amazing how they say it's so smart, but yet they do the exact same things.  Get caught up the exact same ways.  Hundreds and hundreds of times to get caught up.  My thing is this as black parents, When are we going to take responsibility for our children?  Because they going to do what they do.  I'm not trying to change them.  I've accepted long ago.  That's just how they are when it comes into relation with us.  It's some sort of bias there and they got to figure it out on their own.  I'm not trying to figure that out for them.  I'm talking about what we do, right?  We have to pay attention to this and say, what is our options with school?  Now, I could discuss many options.  One option could be homeschool.  Another option could be a private school that's ran by us.  Another option could be a charter school that's ran by us.  So let me go through the fourth option, which is fourth option.  I don't like the most, but I'm gonna address this fourth option because somebody had said something to me.  So I was talking about a video I'd done on my other channel, Advice Media Network channel, and it was basically an assistant principal telling a black girl to turn off her N-word music, right?  in a school in Denton, Texas.  I covered that.  Go check that out.  And I put that on Twitter and he say, well, Phil, you know, I work a full time job.  My wife worked a full time job and we barely making it.  It'd be hard for us to send our children to a private school.  I don't know the financial situation.  I don't know what it's comprised of, but let me talk about a Ford option for those kinds of people.  Then if, is that way for you, then you're going to have to get extremely politically motivated locally.  Meaning y'all have to start running for the school board.  Y'all have to start running for the city council.  We're getting positions in that city, showing up at all those school board meetings, being at those schools constantly.  Let these, these teachers know and these administrators know this is who I am.  I want to find out what's going on in this school all the time and then bring it to the board to keep your foot on the neck constantly.  You have to push, why is it?  we don't have black teachers hired in these schools?  And you have to constantly bring it up to the school board and put they foot to the fire.  And say, oh, was y'all discriminatory?  Y'all don't wanna hire black people?  Like, what's the problem?  Why is it we don't have enough black teachers?  We got a third of children black and we don't have black teachers?  You have a third of children Hispanic, you don't have Hispanic teachers?  Like, what's going on here?  Why is the majority of teachers are white women?  And it's a problem.  Obviously we see it so bad that we have open racists holding nooses, posting them in the walls.  It is a problem.  And you would have to keep your foot on their neck to make them do what's right.  And me personally, I don't see enough people willing to do that to keep your foot on the neck.  People running for the school board and having the whole community come out and vote for that person.  Everybody hands on deck.  Everybody having their voter registration card.  Because what good are you if you cannot even participate in the process and you can?  That's what I'm saying.  You could do something in the public schools, but it's gonna take a mass movement in your cities to do so.  That's how I was going to take.  So, but for me, that's going to be like an uphill battle for you.  Why kids are still dealing with these issues.  My thing is pull your kids out of the process.  That's what you have to do.  That's the best way.  Put your kids in a, when I say private is because we doing it the way we want to do it when it's private or if it's homeschooled.  I know many black people are doing homeschool.  Many black people are sending their kids to private.  And like I say, these private institutions I'm talking about, I'm not talking about taking your kids from public school and go put in some white owned, white ran private school.  No, I'm talking about a private school that's ran by black folks.  I'm talking about a private school that has a high academic record.  that's ran by us.  That's what I'm talking about.  you know, sometime some people move their whole life for their kids education.  Sometime we may have to do that.  I'd rather move somewhere and have my child be in a school that she's happy, comfortable.  I don't have to worry about dealing with teachers holding nooses and sitting there staying in that city.  I'll do anything I can for my children.  That's why I try to work so hard for them.  So one day when the good Lord read it for me, even when I'm not here, they still be taken care of.  But for me, I just can't subject my children to people like that.  I can't.  I can't have good conscience because what if my child was going to that school?  I'll be extremely upset.  But at the same time, I say, okay, what I'm going to do about it?  I'm not going to send my child back there.  What I'm going to do?  No, it's not right.  So I'll just lay it out the options.  There's all solutions.  Which one are you going to take?  That's on you.  But the fact is we got to step up as black parents.  We got to step it up.  We can't allow our kids to be subjected to this.  We need to create schools on top of that as well.  We have to create them and we can't create them.  We don't need their money to do so.  All we gotta do is pool our resources together in our cities and create viable schools for our children.  Every child I know to go to a good black school, they're happy.  They're learning.  They don't have race soldiers beating them up and pepper spraying them or teachers being racist toward them.  So getting them suspended, they don't have those issues and problems.  Our children should not be subjected to that.  Now we get subjected to it.  We grown as one thing, but our precious children know that.  Our precious children shouldn't be coming home and asking you why they call me a monkey.  They should, they should have never had that conversation with you.  Oh, one, one story I'd done.  a little child come home and ask them mom about, you know, they, they call me a slave.  Our children need to be subjected to that mess.  Let our children be innocent and pure long as they can.  who has to deal with that evil.  It's on us to do so.  We have to take responsibility as black parents.  to take care of our children.  These people are not going to take care of our children.  You already know that.  Leave me a comment.  Let me know what you think about this particular story, but we got to step it up as parents and protect our children because this system will not protect our children whatsoever. ",
