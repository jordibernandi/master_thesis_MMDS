            "text": "So, there's a New York Times article that's been widely shared.  that's about Bernie Sanders and how the superdelegates may potentially feel if he's doing really well as we come up to the convention.  So the Times' article was by Jonathan Martin, and he published an in-depth look into how the party's leadership is coping with the seemingly unstoppable surge of Senator Bernie Sanders.  So it included an interesting quote, and this is what I was talking about earlier, about how do we read this?  Is this good reporting, bad reporting?  Is this taken out of context?  Because it is a little ambiguous.  So here's the key quote from the Times article.  It says \u2013 it's a quote from Debbie Stabenow where she says, if we have a role, so be it, but I'd much prefer it be decided in the first round, just from a unity standpoint, said Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.  So she's talking about the second round when superdelegates vote.  And so from the actual article, this is not the quote from Stabenow, but it's what gives context to what she said.  He says \u2013 Where's this thing?  Should no bargain be struck by the time of the first roll call vote at the 2020 convention in Milwaukee, such as a unity ticket between a pair of leading delegate winners, the nomination battle would move to a second ballot.  And under the new rules crafted under the 2016 race, That is when the party insiders and elected officials known as superdelegates would be able to cast a binding vote.  The specter of superdelegates deciding the nomination, particularly if Mr.  Sanders is a finalist, is highly unappetizing to party officials.  Then this quote starts.  If we have a role, so be it, but I'd prefer it would be decided in the first round just from a unity standpoint, says Debbie Stamina.  So that makes perfect sense.  Obviously, if you're a superdelegate or higher up in the party, boy, you want this to go smoothly.  you want this to go smoothly but the question here that i have is the article heavily implies that this is in the context of talking about bernie sanders and his surge.  so was this quote from debbie stabenow in response to a question about bernie's surging?  because if so that is damning.  because then what she would be saying is you know if bernie's someone who's getting close to plurality right?  if he's someone who's going to be a finalist We got to make sure he isn't right.  We got to make sure we like and and then her lamenting of like, oh, man, we have to because we can't have Bernie.  We just can't do that.  But boy, it's going to look terrible because everyone's going to have to see us do that.  Oh, that's really unpleasant.  Boy, we can't have Bernie.  So that's one way of reading it.  And to be honest, I think that's probably the accurate way of reading it.  But it's ambiguous because we don't know the framing of the question.  The framing of the article seems to suggest that it was about Bernie's getting higher in the polls, but it could have just been, how do you feel in general about the fact that you could have to do a superdelegate thing, which I would read that as a possible thing.  It would look bad if we have to do this if we don't have this unity.  But in comparison to the last several dozen or whatever Democratic Party primaries, superdelegates always used to vote.  It's not like there was some major aversion to this before.  So the only way I could see someone like Debbie Stabenow being really, oh, man, this doesn't feel good because I have to do the superdelegate vote, is if she's doing it because she is being instructed to or because the Democratic elite have decided we've got to kneecap Bernie.

So now there's going to be a whole new way.  this nominee is going to be selected.  And we will be covering the DNC convention in Milwaukee when it finally happens.  So, of course, for Chicago-based media, we're going to be there.  And it's going to be very curious to see how this all plays out in regards to who the nominees will be, potentially Senator Bernie Sanders, because he went all the way to the last one, possibly making it to this one as well, it's going to be very curious to see who's going to vote and how it's going to play out because now more than ever you're seeing people getting involved.  Like look at Bernie Sanders' New York event where there was like what, 30,000 people there at max?  i mean there's going to be a lot of voters there's a lot of engagement there's a lot of people talking about this election cycle and it's with no doubt like the main three leading contenders are senator bernie sanders senator elizabeth warren and former vice president joe biden.  people are going to want to know who's going to be the nominee to take on trump and the process that's going to be done and if there's any kind of shady dealings there's going to be a backlash.

            "text": "Yeah, well, this again, this is another key structure argument that if you're the Democratic Party insiders, you have a lot of power.  You have a lot of power, even more than Republicans do in this kind of process.  If you're the media, you have you're.  obviously you're run by your parent corporations, whoever they might be, whether it's if you're CNN, if you're CNN and it's Time Warner, whether you're NBC and it's Comcast, everything.  Everyone is trying to make money, and we have a lot of multinational corporations that have gotten strong enough to almost be like little moons running around planets in terms of their size and scope.  And, you know, we have Apple worth, what, over a trillion dollars.  I mean, this is\u2014they have their own gravity, so to speak, and they are utilizing it.  And Sanders is a threat to, well, every single one of them.  Biden's a friend to every single one of them.  Warren is\u2014 openly trying to compromise between every single one of them.  But Sanders is a real threat.  So if you are a multi-billion dollar business, if you're a Democratic Party insider, and Sanders wants to democratize the process, that's not good for you.  If you are a multi-billion dollar multinational corporation, Sanders isn't good for you.  But if you're a regular person, Sanders is.  So, and that's the other thing, we've talked about like with polls, like the way that polls are conducted and how they expect and how they balance it, who they contact and how they use landlines and how it only really, polls are really only asked of a small percentage of the population anyway.  So, and then they extrapolate with math.  that's based on previous assumptions, and the point we've always been making is that the rules of elections are, in this era, not correct or not accurate to how they've been mapped out previously.  We saw in the 2018 election how many establishment candidates underperformed their polling.  Many progressive candidates exceeded their polling by a lot.  Underperformed by what?  One to three percent.  Overperformed by what?  3% to 8%.  I remember, what was his name?  Richard Ojeda.  He took a plus 65 Trump district and Trump had to come out like two or three times to help.

            "text": "Yeah, he turned it into six.  Was it a single digit?  It got to the point where they stole his VA, his veteran's doctor, Dr.  Medicine, then published it and was like, oh, he's crazy.  Don't throw for him.  And that's where he lost a lot of support because they did that right at the end.  And that was Republicans doing that.  But my point is that in a new era with the Internet and the complete bypass of most mainstream press, I mean, even look at mainstream television, the ratings that they get, they were losing money.  Because no one was watching them until Trump got elected.  And then, of course, to quote Les Nunes of CBS, Trump may be bad for the American people, but he sure is good for CBS because Trump has single-handedly saved the ratings of all these news stations that were on their way out anyway.  in that \u2013 We've not made it a secret to you guys that we hope to replace the local national TV broadcast.  I mean, television is a dying industry.  It takes so much to do.  It's so made up.  Everyone that's speaking to you is a multimillionaire.  Demetrio Mano makes $30,000 a day, which, of course, her entire salary could fund a third of PBS.  And they're all reading from a script.  The point I'm trying to construct is that a lot of stuff that most people hear, and again, even broadcast news, is only heard by several tens of millions of people at a given time.  It's not even close to the majority anymore.  Most people get their information online.  So to get to my original point, a lot of the stuff that is used as metrics to determine who is going to win is isn't relevant or isn't even close to as relevant and definitely isn't accurate in the way it used to be.  So when you read stuff like that, I really take it as they see that too.  I don't think that there's any way, shape, or form that the people at the DNC are stupid.  They may act it.  They're just protecting their own key structures.  That's fine.  But that does worry me because if the DNC decides that that's the route they want to go, well, congratulations.  You've just reelected Trump. ",

My fear is that.  there's going to be a lot of you know shady deals happening and you know let's face it with our corrupt system anybody can buy into an election.  anybody can really dictate how a certain things going to play out and the dnc compared to the rnc.  the dnc has superdelegates the rnc With the amount of criticism towards it, and mind you, there's a lot of criticism towards the RNC.  The RNC does not have superdelegates.  Now, they're just as corrupt as the DNC.  It's a two-party system.  It's not more.  Much more.  Yeah, much more.  Absolutely.  It's a two-party system.  It's a two-party event, but we're not involved in it.  We're not invited into it.  And with the DNC, with the superdelegates, I'm kind of getting a concern of \u2013 some kind of backroom deal happening.

Democrats don't do that in quite the same way.  And a couple of other things I wanted to throw in on this story.  I think it's important to note that this is written.  It's from a New York Times article.  So there's some possibility that it's written from the perspective of obviously none of us want Bernie.  Right.  And we're coming at this from a. obviously progressives do better in elections and we are more left leaning in our ideologies.  And so we like Bernie.
