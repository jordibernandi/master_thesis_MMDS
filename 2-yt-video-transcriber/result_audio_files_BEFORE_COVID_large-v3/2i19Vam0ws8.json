But some days you just wonder, what's it all about?  Am I even good at this?  I see all these perfect Pinterest moms and they're making these whole wheat, gluten-free, chocolate chips, smiley face pancakes for breakfast and packing these healthy, organic lunches in those cute little bento boxes.  And then there's the after school activities.  Did I start the kids at the right age?  Are they in enough to find what they're passionate about?  Are they in too much?  Don't even get me started on the kids' birthday parties.  I mean who can keep up?  I just want to block it all out and focus on what God says about raising kids.  But then you have the pediatrician advice and all of the mommy blogs and what my mom says and what his mom says and my head's flooded with hundreds of voices telling me different ways to do things and none of them are the same and it's enough to make you lose your mind.

Chances are I probably won't be a criminal or a deadbeat because we eat peanut butter and jelly most days for lunch with Wendy's chicken nuggets every now and then for dinner. ",
