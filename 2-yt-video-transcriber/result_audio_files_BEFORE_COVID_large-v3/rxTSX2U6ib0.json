            "text": "Good afternoon everyone.  So I want to start this video first of all saying that we should be able to, you know, have different views and things like that and respect one another.  Just because I disagree with someone or I don't accept certain lifestyles or viewpoints.  You know based off my religious beliefs that doesn't mean that I hate you.  I do not hate anyone.  So I might get in trouble for posting this you might.  you guys might not see me for a while After this video gets out of there, you know gets out there.  I've been banned and stuff like that many times before but I I was sitting here and I said, Lord, I got to say it again.  Many days I don't feel like posting.  I don't feel I'm going to be 100% transparent with you guys.  I look at what's going on in the world.  I look at some of the comments sometimes and this is what I really think to myself and I pray about it.  You could judge me if you want by saying, man, people are stupid.  I think and I say, man, most people don't know what they're talking about.  Like people are literally like common sense isn't common anymore.  All right.  But since everybody's logged in, I'm going to talk about this real quick and it's not going to be politically correct.  I've been posting stuff for five years.  All right.  And it's what God showed me.  I don't claim to be a prophet.  You'll never hear me call myself a prophet, apostle, none of that.  I just call myself Brother Marcus.  But I know what the Lord showed me, all right?  When President Obama was president, I was talking about this stuff.  And it wasn't popular to talk about it because, you know, he's, you know, he's the first black president.  People didn't like it.  And what I'm starting to realize is God does things a certain way that you have to walk by the spirit.  You have to or you're not going to get it.  So one of the visions that God gave me clear as day.  All right.  And I'm going to say it, and secular people might get a hold of this video if a lot of people share it and they're going to say that I'm crazy.  Look, that's fine.  I know who I am in Christ.  One of the visions God gave me, and you might have heard me say it before, I saw in America a golden statue that was erected, just like with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  And when the Lord showed me the side of it, inscribed on the side of it was LGBTQ, all right?  And the Lord was showing me that there, just like with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, there was gonna be a sound that goes out to bow down, all right?  Christians in America are so comfortable.  You know, one of the sayings that God gave me, casual Christians will be casualties.  The Bible says in the last days, people will give over to doctrines of devils and seducing spirits.  I post every day.  Some days what you guys don't see on the other side of this phone is I'm crying tears and I'm frustrated with the people of God.  Number one, I'm frustrated because everybody says they're a prophet.  Everybody has a prophecy.  We don't serve a politically correct God, but everything that comes out of your mouth and you claim to be a prophet of God has nothing to do with what's going on in the world.  You're prophesying to people about money, cars, promotions.  Where do you see that in the Bible?  The prophets of God were sent to the children of Israel to correct.  to rebuke, to warn them about not being like other nations.  They weren't prophesying about wives and husbands, and I'm not saying that God can't give you a word of knowledge, but where do you see that in the Bible?  You mean to tell me that all of these people in the church, everywhere you look, I'm a prophet, I'm a prophet, but all of the stuff that you've got to say that you're saying that God is telling you he's not showing you this?  People can say whatever they want to say about me.  But one thing you can't say is anything that I've said that God has shown me it's come true.  I said Trump was going to win.  I said, you know, so many different things.  You can look at the track record and I get frustrated because, oh, I'm a prophet.  But but nobody's nobody wants to talk about these things.  So here we go.  What triggered this, I just saw the news story where in California, they're banning some kind of state-funded flights to South Carolina because of South Carolina's LGBTQ rights.  viewpoint chick-fil-a they they closed one down i think it was in san francisco because of their lgbtq views.  then they did another one in buffalo all right and so you already seen i've talked about a million times.  remember when i kept talking about the christian baker And they were trying to get him to put that little homosexual message on the cake and went all the way up to the Supreme Court before President Trump was president.  And I kept saying, you better watch out who the Supreme Court justice are.  Hillary Clinton was telling you exactly what she was going to do.  And God showed me that this season right here and you don't have to like it.  But this season right here is a season for Christians to get their act together.  This season that we're in right here is a time for Christians to wake up and look at what's going on in the world.  Pay attention to what the LGBTQ community is doing.  I'm not saying that I hate anybody.  I can get along with anybody.  I'm telling you right now, if you are gay, I love you.  All right.  You can come hang out with me.  I will embrace you.  I won't treat you no type of way just because I won't bow down to that kind of lifestyle.  And I stick to my belief that God made a man for a woman.  And it is pretty obvious that a penis goes inside of a vagina and the way that you reproduce.  And if you didn't have men and women coming together, there wouldn't be no gay people because a man and a woman, the way that God made it to be fruitful and multiply.  That's what makes the earth, you know, go.  Because if everybody was gay, the world would cease to exist.  Right.  But see, I don't say that in a hateful way.  I don't say that in a mean way.  That is what I believe.  That's what I stand on.  And I'm not going to bow down.  But what happens is, is what the enemy is doing.  It's a little thing here and a little thing there.  Right.  You saw what happened with the Christian bankers.  Some of you probably still don't even know what I'm talking about.  The homosexual couple took him up to sue him, right?  And people like, oh okay, well that doesn't really affect me.  Then you saw the other two females who had the t-shirt business.  Same thing, they went to court.  And I'm not exactly sure about the numbers, but they were pretty much told by the court, we're gonna fine you every single day until you print the homosexual t-shirts, right?  And the fine that they were going to fine them would put them out of business.  That's exactly like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  You're going to bow down or we're going to destroy your business.  Chick-fil-A, you're going to bow down or you can't have a shop here.  taking dominion, taking territory.  We're gonna put this curriculum in your schools and you don't have a choice.  We're gonna teach your kids about gender fluidity, all right?  We're gonna not make it optional.  It's gonna be in every single school.  We're gonna indoctrinate your children at a young age.  And oh, you don't think it's a big deal because, well, it's part of the world.  They gotta be aware of it.  But now their mentality, right?  When they're 16, 17, 18, they see the world different, right?  Right.  And they vote differently.  It's the enemy is strategic.  He's not a dummy.  And the whole time Christians are just in there.  Oh, you know, this isn't a big deal because you think that persecution in America is going to come like they're going to start chopping heads off and stuff.  That's not how it's going to happen.  OK, America's too politically correct for all that.  It might happen way off, but it's not going to happen anytime soon.  I'm telling you right now, this is not a hate thing against the LGBTQ, but the fact is they're bringing it to us.  It just hasn't got down to where you are yet.  In California, they're talking about, you know, if you don't use the right pronouns, say you go into TGI Fridays and there's a man who identifies as a woman and you call that man sir and they get offended.  They're talking about fining people.  I in Texas, they were passing laws.  Say there's a trans transsexual person, transgender cross dress or whatever you want to call it.  And they come to your church looking for a job.  They can sue you for discrimination.  That's the laws that they're trying to pass.  And let's talk about this.  The Methodist Methodist Church.  They say oh this whole LGBTQ thing is okay.  They were pushing for it in Chicago.  Churches are accepting it.  churches are bowing down.  See you you don't want to hear this because you just want to hear a prophecy that God is going to bless you.  But the reality is it's gonna come to a point where you they're gonna step to you and you're gonna have to stand there.  You're gonna have to bow.  But in America, we're comfortable And I've been talking about it so many days, I just want to quit Facebook.  Because I'm like, man, these people are not listening.  They think I'm just crazy.  They think I'm just running my mouth.  I'm telling you, pay attention to what the LGBTQ is.  And I'm not saying be mean to nobody.  I'm not saying attack anybody.  But you're going to have to stand for what you believe.  And it might cost you some things.  The exact way the Lord gave me the vision.  Golden statue being erected.  On the side it was inscribed LGBTQ.  And the Lord said there's going to be a sound to bow down.  And we see it all across America.  And you know how it's gonna affect politics?  You know why I talk about politics?  You know why every real man of God in the Bible talked about politics?  Because politics kings were the ones who passed legislation and laws that was persecuting Christians in the Bible.  They're leaders, the ones with power.  So if you're not walking in the spirit Right.  You don't look at the chess pieces moving.  You look at the colors of the chess pieces and you get distracted.  Right.  And so what happens is some of you are going to vote the very people in that are going to pass legislation that makes life hard for your children that you are trying to raise as Christians.  That you are trying to raise as children of God.  that you are trying to raise to walk in truth, but you can't see it because the enemy is strategic, the enemy comes as an angel of light, the enemy comes looking like justice, the enemy comes trying to demonize Christianity and trying to look like he's the right thing, he's the good thing.  Man, if you could really get how deep that is with what I'm saying.  And God allows it, so we have to walk by the Spirit.  It's so easy to, oh, I don't like President Trump.  I told you the prophecy God gave me about that.  Last trumpet.  You can get mad about it.  You don't have to receive it.  But this is a call for America to repent under President Trump's presidency.  And it's nothing to do with President Trump.  I'm not saying that he's a Christian.  I'm telling you what the Lord showed me about this period of time.  But the Lord also showed me that America's not going to do it.  America's gonna get the King Saul that it wants.  I believe, all right, I said Trump was gonna win, he won.  I believe in the prophecy he's going to win again.  And when he wins again, first of all, one of the things that I said before Trump won, what did I say?  They're gonna use this to demonize Christianity.  I said that before he won.  Have you not seen how, oh, it's evangelical Christians.  They're the ones who got Trump in.  Trump is such a terrible president.  It's the Christian's fault.  I have that conversation even with my own friends.  It's not even just evangelicals because they ask about it, right?  And most Christians felt like, well, maybe that was the better choice for the Christian perspective.  So Christianity, man, it's deep.  It's deep.  And it's like, I could sit here and try to explain everything to you for a whole hour.  I think that some people still won't receive it because they're just stuck in their own ways.  There's a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end of that way is destruction.  And like, let me say this, it's nothing to be scared about.  It's nothing to be afraid about, right?  Because God is in control.  So what I was saying was the Lord showed me Trump's going to win again, right?  I believe in that prophecy.  What is it from 2006?  But all that's going to do is make these people even more mad, make these people even more desperate.  People with no, think about this.  There's people with no conscience of God.  They say all the politically correct, right things.  But look at this stuff.  Thank you, Jesus.  The abortion.  In New York, they pass full term abortions.  Right after what?  I told you about them wanting to put the Ark of Bell up in New York.  You know what the Ark of Bell is?  Look it up.  I'm not going to get into it all over again, but they used to sacrifice babies to bail.  Marcus, what are you saying?  It's about territory.  The enemies gaining territory in the schools, gaining territory in California, gaining territory in the courtrooms, gaining territory in the politics.  And you think, oh, it's not a big deal.  It's not going to affect me.  That legislation is going to come down and affect you and your children pretty soon.  So you're gonna have to take a stand.  You're gonna have to say, look, man, I stand for God.  This is what I believe.  It might be at your job.  You might be a teacher at a school.  I go to this college over here and they're so liberal.  They teach evolution like it's a fact.  In my classroom the other day, the professor got up there and said, in my psychology class, she said, if I got up here and told you That God spoke to me and now I'm here to save all of you guys.  What would you think?  And everybody's just like, oh, you're crazy.  Just mocking God in the classroom.  And I stood up and I said something and those it was like those people wanted to hit me.  It made them so mad.  I've gotten into so many arguments with my professors in there.  They teach this.  I'll give you an example.  She says schizophrenia, right?  She says it's because there's a chemical imbalance, right?  A lot of these diseases, there's a chemical imbalance in the body and that's what causes the disorder.  So then, you know, she forgot all about that and she went to start talking about another subject and she said the reason why a man who is a woman, a man who feels like he's a woman might feel that way, and this is exactly what she said, is because there's some chemical imbalance there.  So the way that she was trying to explain it is it's not just like, oh, something's wrong in his mind.  It's the chemicals.  So this is what I asked her.  I said, if you tell me that schizophrenia is a result of a chemical imbalance and a disorder in the body, why don't we consider this a disorder as well?  Because you're saying it's a result of he's a man, but there's a chemical imbalance there.  And the way that my class looked at me and the way that my teacher looked at me, she couldn't even give me an answer.  She said, it's not the same thing.  I said, why?  I said, if schizophrenia is the result of a chemical imbalance and you're telling me a man who feels like he's a woman, it's because the chemicals in him are different.  Why do we not look at that as a disorder?  And some of those people looked at me like they wanted to hit me in there, but she couldn't give me an answer.  And I was going to shut my mouth, but something was compelling me to take a stand.  And some of you are going to have to do that.  I know what the Lord showed me.  I know that some people think that I'm arrogant.  But when when the Lord gives you a revelation and he gives you a word and you stand on it and you believe it and you don't bow down to what people think, they're going to think that you're arrogant.  So I'm letting you know right now.  The Chick-fil-A thing with the LGBTQ community, it's not about them versus Chick-fil-A.  It's about territory.  I'll end the video with this.  I said this when it was happening under Obama.  Obama gave the homosexual community, what was it?  Domestic partnerships, right?  That's what they called it.  They could file a joint tax return.  They could do pretty much everything that a married couple could do, except it wasn't called marriage.  They kept coming for God's definition.  This is what it's all about.  In the beginning, everything that God created, he said it was good.  I made a man a man.  I made a woman a woman.  All this is about is taking your little tiny fist and defying God.  You made me a man.  I want to be a woman.  You said marriage is between a man and a woman.  No, we're going to pervert that.  And that is why America is in trouble.  And President Trump, the last trumpet, the chance for America to repent and get right before they get the King Saul that they're asking for.  I'm telling you, that's what it's all about.  No, we want to take what you call marriage and pervert it.  Look what has happened since that door opened.  You've got little boys dressed in drag queen stuff in bars with adults getting money thrown at them, getting brought on Good Morning America and getting praised.  Look at how far it's gone.  And if you say something, you're the problem.  If you say something, you're the issue.  Man, I can't even talk about this any longer, but go look at all the stuff that's going on.  I got a daddy-daughter dance.  I got to go change and get ready to go.  I don't want to miss it.  And Chicago traffic is terrible.  But go look at what's going on.  It's Christianity in America.  We've been so comfortable.  We've kind of taken it for granted.  You got Christians in Asia having churches and caves.  You got Christians overseas getting killed, getting their hands chopped off, getting stoned.  We're comfortable over here.  So comfortable that we just think no persecution is ever going to come our way.  Not here in America.  This isn't to demonize the LGBTQ community.  I want to say this in the video because your sin is no different than my sin.  You know, whatever it is, pride, fornication, adultery, lying, all sin.  Jesus died for all sin.  So I don't think that I'm better than anybody else.  But the fact is the enemy is going to use what he's going to use to do whatever he's trying to do.  Be not ignorant of Satan's devices.  Pay attention to politics.  Pay attention to what's going on with the LGBTQ.  Just pay attention.  I love you guys.  I got to go. ",
