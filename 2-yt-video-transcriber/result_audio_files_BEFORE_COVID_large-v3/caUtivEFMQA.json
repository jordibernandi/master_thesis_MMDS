            "text": "Good afternoon and welcome to the Wednesday afternoon conference call with Trusts Unlimited.  This is Jim George speaking.  I'm the non-attorney spokesman and facilitator for Trusts Unlimited.  I'd like to thank all of you for taking the time to listen to this call, particularly those of you that will be listening to the replay over the next 24 to 48 hours.  For reasons which I'm sure you will understand, the call is going to be a little different today.  based, of course, on what's occurring on the ground in Iraq over the last basically five days.  So I had a couple of options that I've been going back and forth with.  Should we have a normal call?  Should I just get into a detailed discussion of what's going on in Iraq?  Or should I just provide a brief overview?  I've decided to dispense with a normal call and just have a brief overview of what's occurred.  I've been on conference calls yesterday, right into the wee hours of the morning.  I have conference calls going on all day.  Um, and there's one going on right now that frankly I need to be on.  Uh, I have some contacts in Iraq.  As a matter of fact, I was literally on the phone with an American citizen in the U S embassy in real time at the time of the assault on that embassy.  So I'm going to rely on the individuals that I've been relying on for years.  So let's go ahead and talk a little bit about what all this means for us.  There are two essential questions as far as I'm concerned.  One, are we going to be at war with, uh, uh, Iran, either a direct military conflagration or, uh, these little proxy skirmishes?  And number two, what effect does this have on the re-institution of the Iraqi dinar?  First, I do not believe that there will be a war with Iran.  I think Iran understands that for them to involve themselves in a direct military confrontation with the United States would be a very bad decision and it would end rather quickly and rather ugly for Iran.  And their response last night is an example of that.  What they basically did in response to the death of their top terrorists globally, is basically a fireworks display.  So for internal political consumption, they had to say that they responded, but they also know that a response that actually harmed an American citizen or American interests, there would be a tenfold response.  So I really think that what's happened here, although it sounds counterintuitive, might be a good thing in that the Iranians, if they had any question about the resolve of the President of the United States, that's been taken care of.  Now, how is that going to affect the reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar?  I know that's a mercenary question, but I'm a holder of a substantial amount of dinar, and frankly, I'm as concerned about that as you are.  Again, even though it sounds... counterintuitive, I think that what's happened has actually been a stabilizing effect in Iraq.  Now, what is the situation in Iraq?  Well, we know the U.S.  forces are going to remain.  We know that the troop strength has been increased substantially.  We know that that faux parliament vote for all foreign troops to be removed did not involve a quorum.  It was basically the corrupt Shia that had to save face in some way for their Iranian counterparts.  The death of Soleimani and al-Muhandis, in my view, is a stabilizing issue, and it sent a clear signal not only to Iran, but also to Iraq.  Now, Soleimani has been the figurehead, the person leading all of the terrorist activities outside of Iraq, outside of Iran, excuse me, for their proxies for decades.  He's gone.  He's irreplaceable.  But the second death is just as important, although it's not discussed that much, al-Muhandis.  He was Soleimani's number two man, but he was the number one man in Iraq.  And he's the individual that's been intimidating the sympathetic Shia politicians, particularly Mahdi, the sitting Prime Minister of Iraq.  So Iraq has been put on notice.  The international community has basically told Iraq that they must sever ties with Iran and they must get their house in order.  The UN has threatened to push Iraq back into Chapter 7.  The IMF has told Iraq that they will remain in Article 14 and not move to Article 8,  i.e.,  the reinstitution of their currency globally until they sever their ties with Iran and get their affairs in order.  And the United States has not only beefed up its military presence in Iraq and other surrounding nations, but they also said that there will be sanctions against Iraq as well as increased sanctions against Iran.  So for all of these reasons, my conclusion is that the reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar may be postponed, but will not be suspended as the result of what's happened between Iran and the United States on Iraqi soil.  Now, could the Iraqi dinar still reinstitute in January?  Yes.  But if it does not reinstitute in January, the Iraqi government, the parliament, can still issue the 2020 budget at the old 1180 rate as long as they don't make payments, and they can postpone payments for as long as a quarter.  As long as they don't make payments at the 1180 rate, it would be a simple task to recalibrate the budget at the reinstituted rate.  So my only conclusion from all of this is that while it's very disheartening and disturbing what's happened, I cannot conclude anything other than the provocations by Iran are precisely because they see Iraq moving in the direction of resolving their internal issues.  The reinstitution of their currency means they no longer need the assistance of Iran, but now they can contract with other nations to get the things done that they need done.  And so the Iraqi government needs to make a decision.  They're being forced to decide between Iran and basically the rest of the world.  So obviously it's not good news what's happened there.  But the silver lining in that black cloud, once again, is that the Iranians have been put on notice, and the Iraqi officials that are sympathetic to Iran have been put on notice through the UN, through the IMF, through the United States, and particularly the  U.S.,  military, which has made it absolutely clear that the Iranians and therefore the sympathetic Iraqis to Iran are not going to win in this effort to postpone and defer Iraq's full reemergence as a sovereign nation with a global currency.  That's where we stand right now.  For those that would be listening into the replay, would strongly suggest that you go to our recorded call of December 18th because in that call you will see that I specifically mentioned Soleimani and his activities.  I specifically mentioned the the Iraqi officials that are not only corrupt but are sympathetic to Iran and what the lesson they've now learned is that their sectarianism can no longer take precedence over over the national statehood of Iraq.  And that call also includes all of the information about the program we've put in place to assist you.  So those of you that have not as yet gotten your affairs in order or may not understand what that involves, I strongly suggest you go back and listen to the recorded call of December 18th.  In conclusion, I just want to say this.  I think that at the end of the day, Iran has been put on notice.  I think Iran, although they sound bellicose, has gotten the message.  I think that the corrupt Iraqi officials have gotten the notice that the United States is not going to be pushed around by Iran or by any of the nonsense that's going on.  And if the CBI is true to its word, they are moving forward with the project to delete the zeroes.  the release of the lower denoms and coinage that are currently being held by the eight regional banks, and finally the reinstitution of their currency.  So I want to thank all of you for taking the time to listen to this call.  We will be back next week.  Certainly because of what's happening here on a day-to-day basis, we may require an emergency conference call before next Wednesday.  If that's the case, we will get out an emergency email.  So if you're on our email list, you'll be made aware of that call.  But failing that, we will be back next Wednesday, noon Eastern, 9 a.m.  Pacific.  So thanks again for listening to the call.  And be of good cheer because I do not think that what's occurred in the last, say, five days is going to affect long-term the reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar.  So goodbye and have a great week, everyone.  Bye-bye. ",
