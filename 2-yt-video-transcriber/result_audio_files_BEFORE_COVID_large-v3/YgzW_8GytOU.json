            "text": "Hey, this is the Giggling Conservative, and it's time for the Giggling Report.  Hey everybody, hadn't talked about the envelopes in a while.  What's up with the envelopes part two?  You know, where are these people?  They hadn't really... slammed Trump since 2018.  You know, during the midterm elections, Obama was out on the campaign trail campaigning for Democrats that were running for Congress and Senate.  Of course, the senators that Obama campaigned for lost.  The ones that Trump campaigned for won.  But, I mean, you know, Bush has slammed Trump.  Obama's slammed Trump.  Michelle has.  Hillary has.  Bill has.  What's up?  They're keeping their mouth off of him.  Another thing to consider too, you know, a lot of people get impatient and say, oh, giggling conservative, you're full of crap.  Nothing's going to happen.  They've been saying that the, you know, the envelopes are indictments and nothing's happening, nobody's getting prosecuted, you know, people's telling me that, but the thing about it is, is you've got leftover judges and leftover Department of Justice from the Obama era.  Right now, Trump has appointed, excuse me, mispronounced there, Trump has appointed 95 federal judges, and by the end of the year, he will have appointed 145 federal judges, conservative judges.  I predict before 2019 is out that he will nominate somebody to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg because she is in seriously bad health.  So I think she'll be replaced soon.  So I mean you have to get rid of the Obama judges and you have to get rid of the Obama Justice Department before any of this stuff can take place.  But on Instagram, on Twitter, I mean, you know, the Bushes, the Obamas, the Clintons, they're not really posting current photos.  It's either photoshopped or it's old photographs of them like years and years ago.  So has, which I believe this to be true.  Is the government running their accounts and posting stuff to keep it secret from the public that they have been arrested or detained in some sort of way?  There's been no public appearances that I know of and I've searched all over.  I mean there's been a few of Obama apparently appearing in public and George W Bush apparently delivered some pizzas during the shutdown to Secret Service working without a paycheck.  But other than that there is silence from these people that got envelopes at the funeral.  They're not bashing Trump.  Why is that?  I believe that William Barr at first I was very skeptical because he was a George H.W.  Bush appointee and I was thinking why on earth would Trump appoint this man?  but you know the news out there is that George W. Bush has flipped on the deep state.  so it's very possible that Barr and Bush got their heads together and they're helping Trump.  it's very possible.  I don't know that to be a fact, but it's hard for me to believe that Trump would appoint somebody that would damage him.  So, I mean, the Barr thing sort of threw me for a loop, but I believe that the prosecutions and the tribunals are going to happen.  And that's the giggling conservative for today. ",
