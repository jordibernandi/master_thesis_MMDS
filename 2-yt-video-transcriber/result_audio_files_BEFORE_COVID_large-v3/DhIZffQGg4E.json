Now, I agree that the scholars agreeing on something has a lot of weight behind it, but the fact that they are using their religious bias in order to see these historical facts and use this historical evidence to support these facts, I feel like you really have to investigate it for yourself.  Listen to their actual evidence and then make a decision as to whether or not that evidence is tainted by a religious lens, or if it actually makes some kind of sense.  For this scholarly consensus on Jesus definitely dying on the cross, you have a lot of assumptions that go into it.  For one thing, you assume that Christ was definitely crucified, or this Messiah character, Jesus.  However you want to designate this person, you have to first assume that he was actually nailed to the cross.  So that's assumption number one, which you don't have evidence for.  Assumption number two is that the Gospels, the narratives about Jesus and what he went through, are indeed independent sources.  And he's going to get into sources a little bit later, but you have... have to rely on the idea that they were not influenced by any other kind of Christian thought, that they are direct eyewitness accounts of what happened.  And that's simply not the case.  If you just look at the timeline for these Gospels, you have Mark being written in 70 AD, and then you have Matthew being written about 80 or 90, and then you have Luke being written even farther down in the timeline than that, like 90 AD.  AD.  And then you've got John that was most likely written in the second century, but could have been written as early as the late 90s of the first century.  So you don't have independent accounts of this.  You have Mark, which Mark pulled his information from Paul and the scriptures.  He painstakingly makes this obvious in his writing.  So you don't actually have evidence that Jesus was crucified or this Messiah was crucified.  You just have one book that says it happened, and that book isn't even independent. ",

But that doesn't mean that it actually happened.  That just means that this creed for this new religion called Christianity was made up by Jewish Christians.  And so, considering the fact that Paul specifically says that he only gets his information from scriptures and that all of the information surrounding Jesus is given by Scripture, I would say that this creed that was going around was only going around based on what was said in the Old Testament.  And there are legitimately Old Testament verses that can be mapped to those particular things.  And to say that, oh, all these people saw these things, Paul doesn't actually say that they saw a physical Jesus.  He emphasizes that they saw the risen Jesus, that he supposedly lived, died, and then was buried, not entombed, but buried.  So they only see the risen Jesus.  This is a hallucination.

It only mattered that they saw him risen after the fact that he died, you don't actually have anything that solidifies it.  Like you have people having hallucinations.  You have people saying that they have these visions about Jesus and Jesus is giving them information.  Paul himself says that he only gets his information from this hallucinatory Jesus or Messiah rather, and the scriptures.  So basically what I can summarize from this, that it's more probable that they had a hallucinatory.  things like either they, they fully believed in this thing and so they hallucinated Jesus, or maybe they just ate some shrooms and they read the scriptures too much.

There's nothing that solidifies this resurrection of Jesus in history.  Now, there are historians that talk about the beliefs of Christians, but that doesn't actually mean that the shit happened.  That just means that these Christians believe these things.  That's it.  Like, for instance, Tacitus, which he's not going to bring up, all he says is that there were Christians in Rome in 64 AD.  And then you've got people like Pliny the Younger.  He was just interrogating Christians, so he got his information from Christians, and Pliny could have actually informed Tacitus about it because they were pen pals.  And then, of course, there's the Josephus thing, which is highly contested, and I'm going to be discussing all of these things.  Josephus doesn't prove that Jesus was actually crucified and rose again.  Tacitus doesn't.  Pliny the Younger doesn't.  All of these people don't.

Based on the historical data, my verdict is that Jesus not only claimed to be the Son of God, he backed up that claim by returning from the dead. ",

            "text": "Which you have legitimately no evidence for, Lee.  You want to assert these things as facts, that's fine, but you don't actually have evidence to back up that claim.  And I would implore anybody that's watching this video that definitely believes in the resurrection of Jesus to look at these sources that he's talking about.  And when you look at these sources, you have to consider the timeline of when they were written, how they were written, and what sources could have influenced them.  Because you can't say that Matthew, Luke, and John, and the rest of the Bible is not influenced by other Christian writings or thought because of when they had to have been written.  Mark had to have been written no earlier than 70 AD.  That makes Mark the first gospel.  And then Matthew and Luke directly copy from Mark.  So those definitely aren't independent sources.  But Lee Strobel here seems to think that they are all independent sources and they all corroborate this.  But that's a lot like saying that the rest of the Harry Potter series corroborates what's in the other books of the Harry Potter series.  Unless JK Rowling decides to take to Twitter and proclaim everybody's bisexual something or another.  I don't know.  What was it?  Dumbledore and Grindelwald or whatnot?  apparently fucked?  I don't know.  Anyways.  But I just implore you to actually look at the evidence.  I have a lot of videos on this channel that you can look at the evidence with me and you can make up your own minds about it.  I just present the raw information about it. ",

I get that it's part of the whole dying and rising God motif in the first century and earlier.  I get that.  But if God is so powerful, why couldn't he just blink that shit out of existence?  Why did he need to have somebody suffer?  Oh, that's right, because in the Old Testament, you have these blood sacrifices to cover up for sin.  And so in the New Testament, you have to have another blood sacrifice, but you gotta use human blood because human blood is way more powerful than, like, shitty fucking sheep or ox blood.  So that's why they had to have a human sacrifice.  It was the one final sacrifice because, of course, human blood's more powerful than that sheep blood.  See, when you lay it out like that, it just sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? ",

Like I said before, I implore you to look at the actual evidence and make up your minds for yourselves.  Don't just accept what the religious scholars like to tell you about it.  how?  it's inconceivable to even question whether or not he resurrected from the dead or that he lived in general.  Keep in mind that the same evidence that Lee is proposing here also proves that he actually existed in history.  So you have to wonder, if you can use the same evidence to prove that a Jew was nailed to a cross and rose three days later proclaiming that he was God.  If the same evidence can be used to prove that as it is to prove his existence, should you really be using that evidence to say that Jesus actually existed?
