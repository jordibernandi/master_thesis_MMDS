            "text": "Hi folks, I'm Steve Hindy with Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  Over the years, Shark has made a lot of videos outing police corruption.  Not all police are corrupt, but those who are, and the nasty characters who control them, tend to take exception to people who don't roll over for their misconduct.  Today's video shows an instance wherein corrupt police are willing to set me up for serious injury or worse.  This is a police report from the Colleton County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina.  The date of the report is February 10, 2018.  The reason for the report and our being in Colleton County was a live pigeon shoot.  We used camera-equipped drones to document gun-toting psychopaths and children committing gross cruelty to animals.  In retaliation, the club used thugs, including off duty police, to illegally shoot our drones.  We've added links to videos exposing this event in the description section of this video.  Since I was the complaining party, the police report includes basic information about me, most of which is accurate.  But there are three details that are false.  One detail is that they got my eye color wrong, which doesn't matter much.  The second was a little more important, as it claimed I am loud when I'm not.  The third, however, could be life-altering or even life-ending.  This states, known to carry firearms.  This is an absolutely false statement for which there is no supporting evidence whatsoever.  Imagine for a minute that you're a cop and you're being called to an incident.  You have information in your system about one of the people.  It says he is loud, so maybe he is erratic.  And most important, that person is known to carry firearms.  The whole point of having that information is to put an officer on notice about a possible threat.  That the person you encounter may not be loud in front of you might be considered immaterial.  The report says what it says, and you would figure it says it for a reason.  And according to the report, the person is known to carry firearms.  In this situation, a nervous or scared cop might panic just because the individual reaches into a pocket or a glove compartment, falsely claiming that someone is known to carry firearms could get someone shot.  I have repeatedly written to Colleton County Sheriff Andrew Strickland requesting that this misinformation be corrected, and I want to know who entered that misinformation.  Sheriff Strickland has failed to respond to multiple efforts to resolve this.  Sheriff Strickland and his predecessor, George Malone, were by all appearances under the thumb of Jerry Varn, the owner of the Broxton Bridge Plantation, the canned hunt club that holds live pigeon shoots.  Varn employs both current and former police officers to provide security for his pigeon shoots, and they don't hesitate to break the law by, for instance, illegally shooting our drones.  Varn's lead security person, Joseph Patsirakis, then a police officer for Williston, South Carolina, even bragged about illegally shooting one of our drones on Facebook.  A total of three drones were hit in 2018 by the Broxton thugs.  We gave Sheriff Andrew Strickland extensive evidence regarding those thugs, even including their recorded walkie-talkie communications.

            "text": "We know who they are.  Strickland should have gone after the thugs, but he didn't.  Sheriff Strickland chose to give the pigeon chutes a pass.  The misdeeds of Sheriff Strickland and Sheriff Malone before him are a blot against the integrity of many, if not most, of the officers in the Colleton County Sheriff's Office who are dedicated professionals.  I've actually been pretty impressed with most of the deputies I've met in Colleton County.  If only the Sheriff could rise to their level.  While we will not be silent about the corruption of some in the Sheriff's Office, we do not mean to impugn those who honestly strive to do the job, and we sincerely regret any unintended collateral damage to their integrity.  Please join us in asking Sheriff Andrew Strickland why he is allowing his database to be corrupted with dangerous misinformation and demand that he correct the file and identify the person who corrupted it.  We've included the Sheriff's email address and Facebook link in the description section of this video.  I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness. ",
