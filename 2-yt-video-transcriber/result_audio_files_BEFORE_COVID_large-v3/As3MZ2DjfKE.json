It seems that humanitarian aid has emerged to serve as a key political battleground in the Venezuelan crisis.  President Nicolas Maduro has blocked aid, accusing the U.S.  of using the issue to stir trouble in his country.  He has shot the Brazil border and saying that he may do the same to the Colombia border, if need be.  Now, in Define, self-proclaimed President Juan Guaido insists that he will personally collect food and medicine gathered at the border on Saturday.  Maduro and Russia regard the U.S.  aid as a move aimed at toppling the Caracas government.  What's the U.S.  seeking by pushing for the aid?  Is it really concerned about a dire economic situation in Venezuela? ",

The Venezuelan president says he is happy to accept aid shipments overseen by the UN, but he has slammed the aid Guaido seeks to bring in as a precursor to a U.S.  military intervention in the oil-rich country and also a strategy to overthrow his government.  Guaido, who sparked a deep crisis last month by declaring himself the interim leader, has vowed to move aid from the US and other nations inside Venezuela in defiance of the Maduro government.  Maduro has accused the opposition of seeking to stage a coup with the support of the US, which he said is seeking to govern Venezuela from Washington.  The accusation by Maduro is reminiscent of the 2002 coup against late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, which only lasted 48 hours.  At that time then US President George W. Bush endorsed the coup leader.  President Donald Trump also recognized Guaido as the Latin American nation's interim president and didn't exclude the possibility of using military force against Maduro. ",

Guaido didn't even run in the election.  Who is he?  He was trained in Washington.  He was trained in Washington.  We have to look at this historically and in a global sense.  The United States has to stop the sanctions, stop the war, has to get out of Venezuela and Latin America and quit meddling in everybody else's internal affairs.  The question is not Maduro.  The question is not Venezuela.  The question is the United States and what it's doing.  $5.9 trillion has been spent by the U.S.  military just on the books, not including all the secret funds, since 9-11, 2001.  So there's a huge amount of resources that are being put into the U.S.  military, and they are going to use it.  Why is Elliott Abrams going there on a military... Why is he going there at all?  but he's going there on a military helicopter to oversee this confrontation.  This has nothing to do with the poor and working people of Venezuela who have gotten 2.5 million houses, whose children are going to school, who are receiving food and medicine and are willing to accept assistance from around the world, but are not willing to accept it on U.S.  tanks and military helicopters.
