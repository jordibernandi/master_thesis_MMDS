Did you get your security license in a Cracker Jacks box?  I'm on public sidewalk.  Are you just used to people listening to you?  Because you're crazy, lady.  People just listen to what you say.  I'm not yelling.  You're telling me I can't be here.  Yeah, I think you're crazy.  Hmm?  Okay, well they can stay at home if they feel uncomfortable.  Okay, thanks.  What's your name?  Yeah, go do your job.  So, in America, you can't stand on a sidewalk and aim a camera at a building.  This isn't even a bank that holds money.  This is a branch, a corporate branch of a bank where they just do paperwork.  That makes people feel uncomfortable.  When are we going to stop thinking Bruce Willis movies are real life and start following the law and understanding the law?  Oh, see, okay.  I can't take pictures, but she's going to take my picture.  That's what she's going to do here.  She's hiding behind her car, trying to take my picture.  That's weird.  That's really weird.  I thought pictures weren't allowed.  I thought pictures weren't allowed here.  Oh, you can.  What makes you able to do it and I can't?  Okay, am I on your property?  Oh, I can't take... Yes, but a minute ago you said I couldn't take pictures.  Before that you said I can't be around here taking pictures.  Okay.  Okay, so you were wrong about your first statement.  Okay.  So she's talking about, I think she said La Habra PD, but Brea PD is the closest PD.  La Habra PD is like two cities over.  So who knows?  what she's talking about.  Maybe it's this guy right here.  And this car.  Maybe it's these guys right here.  Brea Police.  Well, there's Brea Police.  42622.  That's cool.  Sorry? ",
