            "text": "in our very first episode we covered parvayim which we equated to oh fear now we'll show you that scripture just real quick.  but we want to get to this and this is going to be a short video so we're not going to do a big introduction.  but we have now found proof that the Dead Sea Scrolls shed some light on this and they reveal that this Parvain is actually a place.  It is a name specifically for the Garden of Eden.  We'll show you.  Check this out.  As we showed in the first video, 1 Chronicles 29 mentions the gold used to overlay the walls of the temple as the gold of Ophir.  And in 2 Chronicles 3, it then says... that the gold was gold from Parvaim, which we looked up means Orient or East, but it's equated here to Ophir because it's also used to overlay the house with gold, its walls specifically.  So Ophir is Parvaim.  Parvaim is Orient.  But is there more to this?  Recently, we have found in the Dead Sea Scrolls something that really sheds light on this.  So see what you think.  Now this is Genesis Apocryphon.  It's a fragment.  we don't have the full copy at least not as of yet.  now it's always funny how scholars name some of these things.  this sounds confusing because you say wait a minute.  is that genesis?  no this is not the book of genesis.  they call it genesis because it's written in the same era as the book of genesis.  but it is not genesis.  in fact it has other names aka tales of the patriarchs much more appropriate hello scholars how about not confusing people?  and then also called the apocalypse of lamech because it's an apocalypse account so of the coming apocalypse which at this time was the flood.  so this is before the flood.  noah is born.  I'll set this up just a little bit.  This is in column two.  We actually sourced this so you can find this, the complete Dead Sea Scrolls by Giza Verms, Penguin Classics, page 481, 482, column two.  So it's all right there.  And this is one of the best translations out there of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  So we'd encourage everyone to go and download that.  You can download that for free online or you can buy the book on Amazon and other places.  Noah's born.  But Lamech is concerned because Noah is a very milky white.  And by the way, this same account appears in the book of Enoch.  It's the same one.  But this is not Enoch.  This is a different account.  And this is a fragment.  And again, it is not Genesis.  It's a different writing.  And you don't see the story in Genesis.  This fruit was planted by you.  Now that's talking about Noah.  Noah is the fruit of Lamech, his father.  He is man is what he's saying.  there's dot dot dot.  dot dot means this is a fragment.  so it means that word is either missing or cannot really be deciphered which is fine.  it won't affect this and you'll see where we're heading with this.  it's a very sensible use you'll see.  so this fruit was planted by you and by no stranger or watcher or son of heaven.  What's that mean?  Angel.  So this is not the child of angels.  This is not a Nephilim, not a giant.  This is man.  Noah is a man.  That's what he's saying here.  But notice Lamech's response.  And his father says to him, why is your countenance thus changed and dismayed?  And why is your spirit thus distressed?  I speak to you truthfully.  So Lamech's seeking more confirmation here.  Then I, Lamech, ran to Methuselah, my father, and I told him all these things.  And I asked him to go to Enoch.  Enoch?  Wait a minute.  If you've seen Solomon's Gold Series, Part 12, where is Enoch?  Now, this is telling right here.  Enoch, his father, for he would surely learn all things from him, for he was beloved and he shared the lot of the angels who taught him all things.  And when Methuselah heard my words, he went to Enoch, his father, to learn all things truthfully from him.  His will, Yahuwah's will, I would imagine.  Now this is where it gets interesting.  Because it's now going to identify where Enoch is.  And we already know where Enoch is.  I'll cover that next too.  He went at once to Parwain.  Now, That's the same word as parvain or parvain.  Same place, same thing.  It is Ophir.  It is Eastern or Orient.  And guess what else?  It's where Enoch lived.  Now this was after, because this is the days of Noah.  Enoch was long gone before Noah was born.  He was not, for God took him, right?  And he was taken into, conducted into the Garden of Eden.  We'll show you the passage.  So the Garden of Eden, Parwain, Parvain, is the same place as Parvain Ophir.  Hmm.  We'll bring this home in a second.  And he found him there.  Who?  Enoch.  And he said to Enoch, his father, O my father, O my lord, to whom I and I say to you, lest you be angry with me because I come here.  So Methuselah even knew that Enoch might be angry that he would come to where Enoch was.  Why?  Because no man was to enter where Enoch was.  Why?  Well, let's show you.  So again, we have the account in Genesis, which says all the days of Enoch were 365 years, which means he would be gone before Noah was born.  And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God, Yahuwah, took him.  Now, it doesn't say that he took him into heaven.  So where did he take him?  Well, the book of Jubilees clarifies this.  Jubilees 4, 23 and 24.  And he, Enoch, was taken from amongst the children of men.  He was not, for God took him.  And we, the angels, that's who's speaking here, who's writing here.  We conducted him into the garden of Eden.  There you go.  He writes down the condemnation and judgment of the world and for the wickedness of the children of men.  and on account of it, God, Yahuwah, brought the waters of the flood upon all the land of Eden for there he was set as a sign that he should testify against all the children of men that he should recount all the deeds of the generations until the day of condemnation.  Now, this is before the flood, so where is Enoch?  This is after Enoch was taken.  He is in the Garden of Eden.  Wait a minute, no.  Didn't?  we just read in Genesis Apocryphon, he's in Parvayim.  Hmm.  parvain is the garden of eden.  this is another reference just like sephar also means the tree of life in hebrew which is where in the garden of eden.  now that is where jocton ophir sheba and their brothers went to according to genesis 10 and to the Mount of the East, which is the holy mountain of Yahuwah God, found where?  In the Garden of Eden.  So now we have a triple reference that also says the gold that Solomon got was from Parvaiim, no, Ophir, no, the Garden of Eden.  All three are equated right here in this one word.  this is incredible and we continue to run into one reference after the other after the other.  that just keeps tying this in such a perfect ribbon.  there is no way that anyone can disprove this but we welcome anyone to try because the process that you will go through to actually view These videos in Solomon's Gold series will be such a process of learning, just as it was for us and has been for all of us.  And we pray that you do.  If you're skeptical and you're watching this video, please, we dare you, watch and do so skeptically.  And go ahead.  You try.  Try to prove these videos wrong.  I'm not talking about a little side note here or there.  I'm talking about the conclusions.  Because in over two years now, no one has, and we do not believe anyone will.

But the ones we're heading into are a bit larger.  The next conference will be August 3rd in Montenlupa.  at the Montenlupa Sports Complex.
