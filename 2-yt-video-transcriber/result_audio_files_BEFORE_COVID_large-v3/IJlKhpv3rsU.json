I told you I'm not leaving.  The Attleboro Dog Park.  That's inappropriate for the dog park.  No, it's not.  Dogs humping each other and she's calling the cops.  Because my dog humped her dog.  I've seen every single dog hump another dog here.  And she tells me to leave and now she's calling the cops.  Like, are you serious?  Yo, I can't wait.  Yo, this is crazy.  You heard of Barbecue Becky?  Because this is the newest one.  Right here.  Let me get her plate.  Let's see.  So everybody know who this woman is.  We can look this woman up.  3ZN996.  Honestly.  Honestly.  You're not trying to help me.  No, you're not trying to help me.  I know the rules.  I'm obeying the rules.  What are you talking about?  I'm right here.  You can't allow your dog aggressively on top of another dog.  The dogs hump each other every day.  And I took him off.  I took him off.  I know it's my opinion.  But you don't call the cops over it.  That's all I'm saying.  You just don't call the cops. ",
