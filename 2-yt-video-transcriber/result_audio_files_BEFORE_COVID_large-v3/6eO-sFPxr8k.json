            "text": "Well, thank you for joining me today.  We haven't done a YouTube in just, you know, a little while, maybe a week or so.  Wanted to do this for YouTube and also wanted to probably post this on our Facebook page.  But, you know, I have in my hand our Old Testament commentary, which is the King James Bible with a 500,000-word commentary.  And it's really interesting because I've worked on this.  We turned it to a printer, and this was actually a three-year process of laying out and printing with the New Testament and Old Testament together.  But here's my point.  I started going back over this and actually had forgotten a lot of the commentary that was in here.  And I went to Daniel and then I started realizing the book of Daniel is like a Bible school.  And I want to give you a nugget from the book of Daniel in Daniel chapter three.  Let's go back in Daniel chapter two.  The king has a dream of an image, and this image has a head of gold, chest and arms of silver, hips of brass, legs of iron, and feet and toes of iron and clay.  Daniel interprets it and tells the king that this represents the empires of what we would call the empires of Bible prophecy, which is Babylon, Medea, Persia, Greece, let's see, Babylon, Medea, Persia, Greece, and then Rome, and of course, the last 18 kings that are going to be aligned with the antichrist.  What is interesting is in chapter three, the king makes an image of gold whose height is three square cubits and breadth six cubits in the plains of Dura.  So here's what it appears has happened.  And I never heard this taught till we started researching this from the book of Daniel.  Now the king has taken his dream has made an entire image of solid gold.  Whatever it looked like in the dream.  It looked like a man that he tells everybody to bow and then he says if you don't bow you're going to be thrown into a fiery furnace.  Now here's what gets interesting.  The furnace.  and again you have to go through a lot of research and there's a lot of notes on this here.  The furnace was the furnace used to make this image of and melt the metal for the image that the king had made that everybody was worshiping.  So the three Hebrew boys, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, are thrown into a furnace that was used to make an idol.  But watch this.  No idol protected them.  The fourth man in the fire, who we read was likened unto the Son of God, is in the fire with them, protecting them.  And so this is interesting, and it also says it was heated seven times hotter.  What's interesting, Babylon was in the country of what we call today Iraq, and there was a lot of substances related to oil there.  In fact, you can find it in the Dead Sea.  There's a tar substance that comes up from the Dead Sea that they used to collect a couple thousand years ago and sell that burnt.  It burnt just like an oil lamp would burn or a fire would burn with wood.  This was a substance that burned and they sold it and people could use it to build fires with.  So there was enough substance there to heat this furnace hotter.  And there's so much in the book of Daniel.  There's a lot that we deal with on mene, mene, tekel, yufarsin, which is the four letters that Daniel interpreted.  The gold candlestick in chapter five at Belshazzar's party was actually the Jewish menorah, and God wrote on the finger of his hand behind it.  The menorah was taken into Babylonian captivity.  How the Persians defeated the Babylonians in one night.  That's a story of history.  Josephus comments on the enemy's response to Daniel's deliverance.  I do a lot of quoting of Josephus here.  A lot of people, Josephus is that thing.  They don't have time to sit down for the next two years and read Josephus.  And I've read it most of my life.  The four beasts.  The Truth of the Little Horn of Prophecy, Daniel 7 and 8.  The Identity of the Son of Man that is mentioned.  The Fourth Beast and the Ten Horns.  And there is a big section at the end of this.  We always have an in-depth.  The Metallic Image and the Dream.  And we break that down for you.  And this goes, this is a big, well, this if you take the New Testament together.  So anyway, I just wanted to give you a nugget.  I was getting ready for a word for OCI.  And had the prophetic on my mind and got to thinking about something that was in Daniel, and I thought, I think people would find that very interesting.  So very quickly, I don't know how many we have left of the Old Testament Study Bible.  We only did 39,000 copies.  When the New Testament, we did 75,000.  So we cut it in half because it was very expensive to do.  So if you have not got your copy yet, and I'm telling you something, it's gonna get cold, the winter's coming, you're gonna wanna stay inside instead of watching all the news and your favorite TV programs, open up, crack this book, open it up, and the thing I like about it, I wanna show you this, and I get a lot of comments on this, is it's very readable.  Our notes are an extra point bigger than most study Bibles.  In fact, some study Bibles, this size is two points bigger, And I can actually take my glasses off.  The Ark of the Covenant had been neglected under Saul, now David, one of the sacred object representatives.  So I can read it.  And that's what a lot of people ask me.  The older people say, well, can I read it?  Yes, you can.  And we designed, that's why it was so thick.  We had to make the point bigger.  If we reduced it, we could have gotten down to that size there.  So go to voiceofevangelism.org.  or pariszone.org and get this.  And also we want to keep you informed that we have some meetings coming up at the end of the year.  And folks, for those of you in the surrounding states of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, now we're coming at the end of May and we're already opened up our registration.  Now don't register unless you know you're planning on coming, but we need you guys from Nebraska and Iowa.  I'm sorry, yeah, Iowa, Nebraska, North South Dakota, edge of Minnesota, edge of Wyoming, plan on joining us for a whole Friday, Saturday, all day Saturday, three services on Saturday at the Convention Center there in Sioux Falls.  We've booked out two big rooms to have space for you to come and there's no fee to attend.  There's no cost to attend.  The hotel that the folks are staying at is located right at the Convention Center and it's just a, you know, you just walk from that one hotel to the Convention Center and there's other hotels right near there as well, many hotels.  But all that information is available on our website.  So we hope that many of you in the West will join me because we've never come to this area in 44 years of being in ministry.  Isn't it about time?  Thank you for joining me.  God bless you. ",
