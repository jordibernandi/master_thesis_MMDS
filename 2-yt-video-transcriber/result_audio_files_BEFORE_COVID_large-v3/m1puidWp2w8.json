Listeners to Grace To You from really all over the world are going to be gathering together, and the theme is going to be the sufficiency of Scripture.  This touches the very core of my being, and it touches the very core of the divine purpose of God in revealing Himself.  Let me tell you what I mean.  The most important thing in the world is divine truth.  Did you get that?  The most important thing in the world is divine truth.  The divine revelation, the word that comes from God, it alone saves from eternal hell and judgment.  It alone sanctifies, and that is moves the believer from patterns of sin to patterns of righteousness.  It alone enriches life at every level in every relationship.  It alone instructs us in how to interpret the world.  It gives us a worldview that is divine so that we deal with everything in the world from the standpoint of reality and not fantasy or whimsy or our own intuition.  The Word of God is everything.  I cannot know God apart from His revelation and His Word.  I cannot know Christ apart from that.  I cannot know myself apart from that.  I cannot understand the universe, its creation, and its uncreation apart from what the Word of God says.  I cannot understand social life in the world.  I can't understand history in the world.  apart from the divine perspective.  So everything that gives me truth and understanding as I live in the world, both in terms of just the natural course of life, sinful people and the consequences therein, as well as the great glories of salvation are all dependent upon my understanding of the Word of God and my confidence that it is God's living Word.  So that's what I've lived for my entire life.  The most important thing in the world is the truth of God, divine revelation, therefore it's the most important thing to me.  My whole passion in life is to make the truth of the Word of God known.  because it is alive and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, because it is the source of life and sanctification and blessing and all that God gives to those who believe its truths.  So, you might want to join us very soon for the conference.  The theme again, Sufficiency of Scripture, Truth Matters Conference.  You can log in to Grace To You and participate in the live stream broadcast of the messages that are going to be going out in that conference.  Take advantage of that. ",
