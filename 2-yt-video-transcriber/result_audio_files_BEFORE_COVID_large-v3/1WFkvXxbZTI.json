            "text": "I think Keanu Reeves is awesome.  I think he's a great person.  He's, like, got a history of donating to children's hospitals.  He's been in some really great movies.  I think John Wick is awesome.  Some people said Replicas was really bad.  I didn't think it was really bad.  I enjoyed watching it, especially because Keanu was in it.  And because Keanu's such a good dude, I will basically go see any movie he's in.  Like I made the joke on Twitter, there could be a one hour long scene of him eating Pringles in a library where people complain about it.  And I just watch that and be like, I like this guy.  He's a good dude.  And so it's awesome to see him in new video games.  But here's the thing.  There's a viral meme going around.  Daily Mail writes it up.  He's too pure for this world.  Fans praise Keanu Reeves and brand him a gift from God after noticing that he rarely touches the women he takes photographs with.  You may have noticed a meme.  In this meme, it says, so you're telling me I can dodge lawsuits?  No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you when the time comes, you won't have to.  And you can see Keanu Reeves pulling off the hand hover.  No, confident, famous, wealthy Keanu Reeves hand hovering.  If you're not familiar with the hand hover, it's normally attributed to guys with less confidence who are scared to touch women for whatever reason.  I do not see Keanu Reeves as that man.  In which case, the meme tells you everything.  Is Keanu Reeves really trying to dodge lawsuits?  Maybe.  I don't necessarily think it's about lawsuits.  It's about negative press and people getting angry.  This shows us the sad state of the Me Too era.  Now, there are many people who are saying, no, no, no, he's just a gentleman.  I disagree.  And I have evidence to suggest this is because of outrage culture and the MeToo movement.  Not particularly, not specifically.  It's maybe not even that big of a deal.  It may not be that Keanu is sitting there thinking like, oh man, Me Too is going to get me.  But I think these things are in the back of everyone's minds.  So here's what we're going to do.  I am going to show you what makes me believe this is specifically about anger, outrage, lawsuits, etc.  Well, check out this story.  And I'm going to show you the evidence in just one second.

So in this story from the Daily Mail, they highlight a bunch of people who shared these photos where there's arrows pointing to him hand hovering and they're calling him a gentleman and they're claiming that it's not because of Me Too.  Some people are saying this.  But I want to highlight specifically what people were claiming in terms of the lawsuit.  So they say that while some people say it's a gift from God, other fans of the actor have stated that they believe he purposely doesn't place his hands on the people he takes photos with in order to avoid accusations of inappropriate behavior.  One Facebook user said he's being smart because he knows he'll be targeted by sexist and feminist people.  Aziz Ansari, career derailed briefly over a bad date.  Remember that?  Remember Chris Hardwick, falsely accused and suspended from his show pending an investigation.  What do you think happens then?  If some woman, he's got his arms on them, and they later claim that he was touching them inappropriately, they're going to point to the photo and say, there it is, Keanu touching the women.  Now you will never be able to make that claim.  They can say, oh, after that photo, he touched me.  I don't believe it.  In every single photo, he doesn't touch any women.  But there's still the possibility that some people believe Keanu is just lacking confidence.  And while that's possible, I'm going to show you something that says to me, absolutely not.  Remember this?  BuzzFeed News.  It's a photo of Neil deGrasse Tyson.  He grabbed a woman's arm to look at her tattoo of the solar system, I believe.  And she got mad at him later.  Here she is smiling.  He's got his arm around her.  He takes her arm and looks at it.  Was she not upset that he put his arm around her?  This was apparently there were four women who accused Neil deGrasse Tyson of inappropriate behavior.  All and I don't want to talk about the others, but I will point to this specifically and say, what do you think happens when a celebrity sees this high profile target, lots of money, and you don't know where the line is and no one else cares?  I'm not saying Neil deGrasse Tyson's a good dude.  I think he's kind of a weirdo and he tweets really dumb things sometimes.  Take a look at this photo.  That's what she complained about.  Let's read this.  As they chatted, Tyson grabbed her arm to get a better look at a large tattoo of the solar system that extended up her arm, shoulder and chest.  Tyson repeatedly told her that he was looking for Pluto, which involved him reaching into my dress and sort of looking down it.  It was an invasion of my space, inappropriate and sexual, she said.  At the time, she noted, Tyson wasn't the megastar that he is now, but he was a big deal among scientists and she was a postdoctoral fellow.  I think the power imbalance was a reason why I didn't wrench my arm away from him and tell him to stop touching me.  You're not going to do that to someone who is powerful in the field.  Really.  Or maybe it's that she didn't really care until all of a sudden everyone got angry.  I'm not going to sit here and say, listen, Hold on.  Let me back up.  I will say this.  If someone is grabbing your arm and you're upset, say, please don't touch my arm and we're done.  But you mean to tell me that this happened and she didn't care until way later.  All of a sudden now he is a megastar and it is an issue.  So think about someone like Keanu Reeves, who is a megastar and everything's going great for him.  There was a period.  where Keanu, it was not that long ago, he said that people just weren't casting him in big roles anymore.  And this was around the time the first John Wick came out.  And a lot of people didn't think the movie was going to be all that great.  Keanu was in replicas.  People really didn't like it.  I thought it was fine.  You know, it's a weird movie, but sure, it was fun to watch.  But people, Keanu Reeves was kind of in like a lull in his career.  John Wick came out and everyone loved it.  I love John Wick, the first one.  The second one's okay.  I think the third one's a little better than the second one.  I don't know.  The first one's really, really good.  And now with Cyberpunk 2077.  2077 coming out, new video game.  And with Keanu Reeves presenting at E3, a viral meme going crazy where he says, you're breathtaking.  And then someone, you know, he says, this game's gonna be breathtaking.  Someone yells, you're breathtaking.  He has it back.  He's smiling.  Everyone's having a good time.  Keanu Reeves is the wholesome celebrity everyone loves right now.  Everything is going great.  Bill and Ted 3, I'm hearing rumors about.  I'm excited for that.  In a new, highly anticipated video game, think about where he probably is in his mind saying, everything's back on top.  There was a lull.  My movies are smash hits.  People love me.  The hell if I'm about to touch a woman and get Neil deGrasse Tyson, all because he was looking at her tattoo.  Is it possible Neil deGrasse Tyson crossed the line?  Sure, sure.  I don't know exactly what happened in this photo, but it doesn't seem she didn't complain about this.  Take a look at this.  He put his arm around her for a photo.  She smiles.  He then looks at her arm.  Is he doing anything really wrong right there with the way he's holding his arm, her arm?  I really don't see it.  And if she wasn't happy, she could have just been like, hey, excuse me, like you're a little too much.  But that's it.  That's seriously it.  She's mad that Neil deGrasse Tyson touched her arm, and that was enough for her to come out as an accuser against him of impropriety.  And that's damaging.  Now, it's not like it ended his career.  But again, think about the mindset of Keanu Reeves.  Now, of course, look, I'm not trying to act like he's ever in a really bad period or anything like that, like depressed or something.  No.  But he did say, I could be wrong about this, but I read a quote or something where he said that people weren't casting him anymore.  People made fun of him for a while.  And I didn't really enjoy, I didn't really get it.  After he played Klaatu in The Day the Earth Stood Still, people were making fun of him because they were saying he had no range.  And I was like, dude, he was specifically cast to be a stoic alien.  Like, come on.  And they'd be like, yeah, what about that movie?  He's been in dramas and romantic stuff.  And he's been in comedies.  He was in Bill and Ted.  He's Ted Theodore Logan.  He was a quirky, crazy guy.  Like, I don't think that's fair.  But think about all that bad press and people making fun of him saying he can't act.  All of a sudden, he's not getting the roles he wants anymore.  John Wick smash hit on top of the world.  Never gonna get me too.  But there's more evidence here.  Check it out.  They say, following the comment about sexists and feminists, they say, they'll come up with the stupidest question like, oh, wow, why is he holding her hips?  More than anything else, these pictures make me sad.  The fact that he has to do this to protect himself shows the state of the morality and reason in society.  The images were also shared on Twitter by a user who said, Keanu ain't taking no chances.  He's smart.  I take my pictures like that also.  Now, me too.  I take pictures with people.  I am not putting my arm around.  You can put your arm around me.  I will not touch you.  I will not do it.  I'll keep my arms in my pockets to my hips and I'll lean in like he's doing right there.  I am not going to have this same nonsense happen to me.  And it's sad, isn't it?  Because we used to pat each other on the back.  We used to, you know, grab someone's shoulder, take a photo, put your hand on someone's shoulder, put your arm around their waist.  You can't do it anymore.  It is the sad state of the Me Too era.  For all the good that's come out, calling out the worst of the worst, the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction and And now you can't even be in a photo with somebody.  But here's what I want to highlight.  Check this out.  Someone said, I don't think embracing someone asking to take a picture with you is disrespectful in theory, but choosing to still respect their personal space is smart because it is thoughtful.  In response, one woman said, that's how I'm reading it, too.  Respecting their personal space.  I don't think he's reacting to the Me Too movement.  That's just how he is.  Plus, he's a Virgo, so he could be slightly germaphobic, lol.  Another said, I've seen a couple people comment.  It's sad.  It has to be like this.  What's actually sad is the obsession we have with touching women at any given moment.  He's just being respectful of others' bodies.  What a concept.  And there is the feminist outrage.  Not the worst of the worst, but you can see it right there.  Touching women's bodies.  Excuse me.  They're touching him.  People put their arms on each other.  It's called a hug.  We hug people.  When I see people I haven't seen in a while, I give them a hug.  When it's a dude, if it's like a good friend of mine, we get a hug in there.  I hug people.  It is not sexual.  It is a friendly neighborly thing to do.  But man, how screwed up are we that we can't even do this anymore?  I know somebody who's kind of not like a good friend.  I will grab the hand like this and we'll come in for a hug like that.  Because I think humans can make contact in non-sexual ways.  We can love each other.  We can connect without it being about invading someone's space.  But now, because of the pendulum swing of the Me Too era, it's just, don't touch me, man.  Don't touch me, because if you touch me, you might accuse me of making you touch me.  I don't even know.  So I'll say this.  It's possible.  Keanu Reeves is just doing a handover because he's not that confident.  I really doubt it.  He's friends with some of these people, okay?  He's friends with Winona Ryder.  I don't think he has anything to worry about with her, but hey, man.  Here's the thing.  If some random woman comes forward and says Keanu groped me, he's going to be like, look at the photos of me and my friends.  And they're going to be like, yeah, he doesn't even put his hands on his friends.  No one's going to believe you.  And that gives him a good defense.  So again, let me end with one final thought.  I don't think Keanu Reeves, I'm not going to make an assumption he's ever been in a period where his life was over or ruined or anything.  But I think he's doing really, really well right now.  And it's very important for him to maintain this position.  And I, you know what?  I agree.  The other thing I'll say is he doesn't have to put his arm behind them at all.  He doesn't, you know, like there's one photo where he's leaning, but he's behind some woman and he's just leaning in.  He could do that if he really wanted to.  And he, and he has, but it says to me here that he wants to still, you know, he's confident enough to come and put the arm around, but he's like not touching you.  It's also slim.  I don't think it's actually the reason, but maybe he wants to make sure everyone sees that he doesn't do this.  Anyway, I won't ramble too much on this.  My final thought on the matter is if you want to ask me why I think this is more about Me Too and lawsuits, look no further than Neil deGrasse Tyson in this photograph.  He was looking at a woman's tattoo and she got mad way later on.  So think about that.  Maybe it's not necessarily a lawsuit, but someone might freak out.  He could put his arm around her and try to shriek out.  I ain't playing that game.  Or better yet, what if he does something like this?  And then 10 years later, they're like, remember, Keanu did this.  And here's a photo to prove it.  They could change their story.  They could forget.  They could go nuts.  Don't play the game.  I won't.  And it makes me sad, but I'll leave it there.  Stick around.  I got more segments coming up later.  Next video, youtube.com.  slash Tim cast.  And I will see you there. ",
