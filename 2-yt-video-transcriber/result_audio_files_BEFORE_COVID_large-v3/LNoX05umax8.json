I'm out here with SGB News First.  It's the Lancaster Sheriff's Department.  And, um... I've already done this station about three times.  So SGV is going to do it now.  This is his first time doing the Lancaster Sheriff's Department, so I don't know what's going on here.  They got a lot of people getting released right now.  A lot of cops are coming out, so I don't know if these are the new trainees or what.  Well, I'm going to walk up here.  I'm mainly going to be doing backup work for him right now, so... Because, I mean, all the sheriffs appear, they already pretty much know who I am already.  Sorry about that, guys.  Sorry it's so wobbly right now.  Yeah, these are all the new ones.  That's good, we catch them now before they get out here in the street and start violating people's rights for photography or for whatever else.  Couple of them look back, they had little sour places.  These are the new recruits, guys.  And this is what they look like.  They look like they're getting smaller and smaller.  But this is them before they get all the way brainwashed with the Sheriff's Department.  Your new recruiter. ",
