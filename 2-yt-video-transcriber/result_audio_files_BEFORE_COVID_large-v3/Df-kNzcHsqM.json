            "text": "What makes you rise when you dress better, and I mean this sincerely, because I always relied upon my looks to get women my whole life.  I'm tall.  I go like this.  I can walk in somewhere.  Obviously, it worked.  But as soon as I started dressing better, women noticed those details.  They're like, oh my god, I really like your shoes.  I really love, oh, that shirt fits great.  I like your whole outfit.  Like, wow.  I would start getting open.  I got way more open to women when they would approach me, more than they already did.  I was like, wow, that really works.  That really, really works.  Dress better.  Dress better.  Be interesting.  Again, that goes back to feeling.  And then inner world, your mental origin point.  One of the things.  to read Casanova's biography, he screwed up so many people's lives so many times, he never gave a shit.  It's like he'd go with his situation.  So half the time, he'd try to get the girl that he seduced married to somebody else.  He's like, I know I just slept with you for five weeks and I got bored with you, but let's find you a husband so I can go screw another 18-year-old in St.  Petersburg, because that's what I feel like doing.  Mental origin point, the outcome independence.  You have to not care how a situation goes.  Game is not something I dive into, typically, since we're on the subject.  When you are in a scenario with any kind of woman and she thinks that you want something from her and she gets the feeling, then she starts running it.  When women know that they're disposable to you and that you're simply enjoying the process of being with them, that's when they'll love you.  That's how that goes.  Again, that's the difference between alpha and beta.  And alpha has an abundance mindset towards women.  A beta is always in a place of supplication.  He takes what he can get.  If you can reverse... And that's mental.  That's not physical.  Too many guys have to get on the subject.  You're tall, motherfucker.  Shut the fuck up.  It's not about being tall.  It's not about how much money you make.  You could be dirt poor, living in a fucking van.  You could be out of prison.  You can literally be out of jail and be sleeping at your mom's house, and women will want to sleep with you if you have that mindset of abundance.  If you lead yourself in, like I said, you present yourself in that way, or you are that way, I should say.  The question I always pose to people, is she with you, or are you with her?  She should be with you, not the other one.  Life is a confidence game.  Confidence is confidence.  It goes back to believing in yourself.  If you're going to be these qualities, you have to live them out, and you have to internalize them.  And then on the subject of humor, which this could probably be a whole talk into itself, being humorous, it's observancy.  It means that you pay attention to things and that you understand people.  People that are, let's say, autistic, whether they're human beings or they lack understanding of human behavior, they're typically not funny.  And if they are, it's purely by accident.  When you can be humorous on purpose or you can crack jokes on purpose and you show a lack of seriousness, you don't take yourself too seriously, you make fun of her, you make fun of yourself, you make fun of the situation, whatever the case may be.  What is it?  It's perception.  It's perception.  It's understanding of human nature.  That's why comedians, despite oftentimes being gross guys, they have groupies too.  Why?  Because they make, again, feeling.  And they make them laugh.  And also it shows somebody, wow, he made me see things and feel things and see the humor in things I didn't see before.  Women on a certain level, they're like children.  They don't want life to be too serious.  So if you can take a scenario and create humor in it, again, that's compelling.  That's attractive.  So last slide, then we'll go into questions. ",
