            "text": "Hey Manktoes, this is Vention.  Finally got rid of that scooter.  Well, big things happening lately.  As you guys are aware, I have frigging cancer.  And I didn't really want to bring you up to date until I knew more about the situation.  So I thought I would throw that out there.  But the one constant advantage of being a MGTO in a situation like this is that I don't have anybody really moaning or nobody who's like financially dependent upon parasiting off of me.  So I don't have anybody who's like, terribly full of anxiety and like in terror for her own well-being.  um because i have cancer right.  um i have family who are concerned and friends who are concerned and i gotta say everybody at work.  um all of my fellow mechanics and my foreman and my lead mechanics.  uh they are they have just all been awesome you know they're doing they're One of them, they're saying that if I am like obliterated by the chemo or something and I can't work something like hard, like an in-frame or something, that they'll find me a job that I can do, you know, which is... which was really cool.  I mean, in some situations I'm often put in working with mechanics who are not familiar with like engine work or electrical or troubleshooting of various things that, but they would still have all their energy and I might be in a situation where I don't have mine.  So it's kind of nice.  And plus I've got seven weeks vacation so far, well built up, so I should be okay.  So, yeah, the profound advantage of one of the advantages of the MGTO lifestyle is that in a situation like this.  Hey, Dan, how are you doing?  Don't say my name.  Pretty good.  Hello, no name.  Thank you.  In the past, he has gone, hey, how's it going?  Blah.  I said, oh, she's delete.  Okay.  I'm going to pause you for a second.  Oops.  Okay.  Well, oh, we were, my dad and I were just discussing his, um, his options as far as renting a place.  And, uh, he was looking at a nice place for about $1,100 a month, a nice house in a, in sort of a smallish town here in Western Washington and about $1,100 a month.  So that, uh, and he takes home with his retirement, he takes a 2,800 home.  So, uh, It would take a chunk out of his earnings, but it would be hard for him to find as good a deal as he's got here because I don't charge him any rent.  All we do is just split utilities.  But in any case, yeah, back to the cancer thing.  So we've got... I had a... I went ahead and got the first, I got the colonoscopy and it was a big ugly tumor.  Maybe I'll splice it in if you guys don't, probably don't want to see that.  And then after that I was referred to a CT scan, which is sort of a mediocre res scan, which can show a few things like it showed the problem or a couple of things in my liver as well as in my colon.  So, um, and right about then, no.  And then, uh, after that I was referred to a surgical doctor who, uh, who basically, uh, was talking about, you know, the possibility of getting it surgically removed.  But then I was scheduled for a PET scan which is where they inject radioactive sugar into your blood and then you basically sit there for an hour while the tissues absorb it and as you guys are aware how, uh, how thirsty, um, cancer cells are for sugar.  And then what they do is they throw you into the, something that looks like a big MRI.  And then they, uh, they do a scan and that way they can image the radioactive areas.  So, uh, So then after the PET scan, actually the same day I went to the surgical doctor, but it wasn't available yet.  But then I just went to the oncologist and I saw the pictures of the PET scan.  And sure enough, I've got whatever it is has spread to the liver because I've got a hotspot there.  which is way more radioactive than the rest of the liver, and it is clearly about maybe the size of a marble.  So then on top of that, I have, of course, the one in the colon, which is the worst, you know, it's like rating 12, and the one in the liver is rated six, I think, as far as hotness goes.  So anyway, then... And now that was today.  So and then of course she's going to want to schedule me for chemotherapy.  And then after the but first actually I have to be scheduled for a biopsy of the liver where they jam a big needle into your back.  and poke the tumor a little bit and prod it you know.  and then and then basically they get a piece of it and then they say yep it's cancer but it almost certainly is the way it's glowing.  so then after that they will probably schedule chemo where they have to put a big fitting into your chest And then it has a tube that goes into a vein.  Because if they try to do that through your arm, it'll wreck your vein.  Because it's some such hideously toxic shit.  So that's all fun.  And then after the chemo, they were talking about surgery to remove the tumor.  The one in the rectum, right?  So what I am going to do... It is what I have been doing.  The same day that the PET scan became available and I had the PET scan done, I went ahead and got the dog medication and I doubled down on the intermittent fasting and all kinds of supplements.  Man, I've got a box, a cardboard box.  It's about a foot and a half long by about 10 inches wide.  That's full of all kinds of supplements.  Vitamin D, amygdalin, novadilin, basically.  That's that... uh, um, that stuff that's made out of apricot pits.  Um, then you've got, um, black seed oil and I've got the CBD oil and I've got, uh, mega strength vitamin C that, um, is, uh, oil absorbs through oil.  It absorbs better than the regular type.  And I've got, uh, geez, I've got so much stuff.  I'll probably have to make a list.  Um, and add it.  But anyway, I'm going to double down on what I can do.  I'm going to basically do another three or four day fast, probably starting tomorrow.  But I have to take all of those supplements, including that dog worming medication that's supposed to be really good against cancer.  And then, but it'll wreck my, I mean, it'll, I got really nauseated last time I tried to take that stuff on an empty stomach.  So I'll have to take a little something, maybe a couple of eggs in a cup or something.  to buffer it.  So that'll effectively make a five-day fast.  It's almost sort of a combo between an intermittent fast and a real serious fast.  So in any case, that is the plan.  And I'm gonna go hardcore into all of the alternatives while the conventional medical system is dithering around.  And then once that, Then hopefully the, uh, I'll have those tumors shrank or knocked down a bit before they, uh, start their chemo.  And then when, if I'm convinced that these tumors are gone and get another scan, uh, then I will put a stop to the chemo probably early in spite of the howls of protest from the medical establishment.  So, uh, that's the plan.  Um, I've only had five or six days on the dog medication and about maybe three weeks of hardcore intermittent fasting, maybe less.  So I haven't really had a chance to make the alternatives work as I would hope, but I don't know if I want to wait.  I might go with the chemo.  In fact, I probably will.  Yeah, that's what we're up to up here at the Vention House.  It's lovely news.  But, as I was saying, if you don't have a woman and her children, not necessarily yours, to support, and you don't have all of that extra stress of her moaning and wringing her hands and So I'm really concerned for you invention, meaning I'm really concerned for my income and my wellbeing and status, you know?  Um, so, um, yeah, they might feel a little something.  It's hard to tell, but probably not much as, as we all know, women, women don't really love men.  Uh, the same way, you know, we, uh, blue.  when we're blue pill guys, we can, love them like unconditionally.  It just doesn't work that way.  They are just not set up for it.  And it's better not to expect that of them because you're gonna be disappointed.  But now I have like massive surplus income, massive savings, paid off house, vehicles paid off.  I can live comfortably on like, I live comfortably on, way less than probably less than 1400 a month considering i have to pay 300 a month for property tax on this place.  um so yeah it's a huge amount of that is one stressor the money thing.  there's a lot of guys who do who are undergoing what i'm going through.  Um, and plus they are have to deal with.  and plus they are, um, overloaded as far as their time and their, their requirements for, um, constantly courting their wife to keep her from, from monkey branching to some other guy.  Um, and he has to hold all of that down and.  On top of that, then he gets cancer too.  Shit, I'd be ready to freaking eat a bullet in a situation like that.  So, yeah, things are not great at the Vincent house, but so far so good.  We shall see how it goes.  Wish I could give you better news, but it's not.  It could be a lot worse.  So don't get married.
