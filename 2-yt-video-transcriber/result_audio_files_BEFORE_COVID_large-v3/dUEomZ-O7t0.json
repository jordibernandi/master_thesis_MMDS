            "text": "Any woman who has been raped has suffered a horrific violence and injustice.  She needs help, healing, and the support of her community.  The rapist should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.  And in many cases, our laws must be improved to more fully protect women and girls from their attackers.  This is a very personal topic for me because my own mother was a victim of rape.  And she chose life.  My life.  When someone says that children conceived in rape should be aborted, they're talking about me.  My mother saw that my life was not worth any less than anyone else's simply because of the way that I was conceived and that I shouldn't be put to death for the crimes of my father.  Abortion does nothing to give the woman the healing that she needs and deserves.  Abortion doesn't erase the rape or undo the violence that the woman has suffered.  Instead, abortion subjects this woman, and now her child, to yet another act of violence that also cannot be erased or undone.  As many rape survivors have poignantly testified, abortion is actually an obstacle to healing after rape.  Abortion adds trauma to trauma, and it creates yet another innocent victim.  It's never fair to punish an innocent child with what amounts to the death penalty because her father committed a heinous crime.  Under our current laws, we do not even give rapists the death penalty.  So to put the child to death is to give rapists more rights than we give innocent pre-born children.  Listen to the testimony of Jennifer Christie, who was brutally raped on a business trip.  She became pregnant, but she rejected abortion for her son. ",

No woman is ever going to forget what happened to her.  I've been told so many times that if you just had an abortion, you won't always have this reminder hanging over your head.  This reminder.  Is my son a reminder?  He absolutely is.  My son is a reminder every day that as women, we can rise above our circumstances.  My son is a reminder that love is always stronger than hate and that who we are as human beings is not determined by how we were conceived. ",
