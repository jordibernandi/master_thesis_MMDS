            "text": "Hi, my name is Aaron and this is my show, Re-Education, and today we're going to talk about other YouTubers.  How cool is that?  Now, at the end of this video, I'm going to give a shout-out to a few YouTubers that I can think of, but I'm not going to bury the lead here because I think it's important that I actually tell you guys the thing that everybody has been asking me about since... Basically, I've started this channel and the two questions that I get constantly are, what is my opinion on Vosh and what is my opinion on ContraPoints?  Well, I'm going to start off with Vosh because I have spoken to Vosh directly before and I've also enjoyed many of his videos and I have to say that Vosh is a YouTuber.  that is doing basically what I'm doing, but the flip side of it.  He's kind of like the anti-matter to my matter.  Now, what do I mean by that?  Okay, if you're familiar with my How to Revolution series, please check it out.  if you haven't checked it out.  you'll know that I come up with a few different forms of argumentation tactics.  And one of the tactics that I talk about is debate.  And debate is one of those things that is very interesting in that it does draw people to your side.  It can.  But for the most part, debate is something that you use to embolden your base.  When you're having a debate with somebody, it doesn't necessarily matter if your opinions are right or wrong.  If your facts are right or wrong, what is the most important is showing strength, showing that you are strong.  And Vosh has that in fucking spades.  The best part about it, though, is that not only does he project strength like a leftist Trump, but, you know, smarter and far more attractive, he also has this ability to actually be a fucking genius while doing it.  And I'm talking about in a live debate, while he's talking to somebody one-on-one in real time, he's coming up with, incredibly brilliant arguments and tactics and things that I would never even think about and tying it all together with jokes with a fucking sense of humor that is dark and witty and makes everybody laugh their fucking asses off.  the first time I heard him say that somebody had a smooth brain I nearly fell off my fucking chair and It's just constant like that.  He comes up with some of the most brilliant things that you could possibly say.  And as much as I do hold to the idea that debates don't often change people's minds, I do think that he is fundamentally doing something that is needed, nay, necessary, nay, undeniably important.  in the leftist community is showing that we can actually tear apart fucking arguments in a way that isn't punching down and isn't alienating anybody and actually attacking the real problem.  Capitalism, fascism, bad arguments in general, stupid fucking no-minds that come in with bad opinions and bad ideas.  Now, I personally deal with those things in a completely different way.  Now, yes, debate might not change everyone's mind, but it has changed my mind in the past on several things.  I mean, that was what got me to be an atheist in the first place, was watching people with bad arguments getting their asses fucking handed to them by an intellectual heavyweight.  Now, I could do a debate, and if somebody out there wants me to do a debate, I would, I guess, be willing to do something like that, but for me, that's not what I like to do.  I like to have a conversation with people, and I've said this in the past.  I've literally just made a video about it just a few minutes ago.  However, that ends up coming out.  I'm not entirely sure.  but the video was specifically talking about different forms of argumentation and how to remove the red pill.  And Vosh blows up red pill arguments like they're fucking pimples.  So yeah, the way that Vosh handles reactionaries and people with bad opinions is completely the reverse of the way I handle them.  And actually, I think when it comes to professional reactionaries, people who are actually relying on being a reactionary for their wealth, as a career, Vosh's form of argumentation is fucking spot on.  You need to knock these motherfuckers down because you can't use my tactic to argue with a professional reactionary.  You just can't.  I would never in a million years be able to convince Sargon of Akkad or fucking Richard Spencer Punchboy here of changing their minds on anything because they are solely reliant on that fucking reactionary ideal as their form of income.  I can't touch that shit worth a fuck.  But Vosh can.  And he can do it in a way that is fucking hilarious.  Now, when talking about strength, I don't want to forget the one person who I find to be probably the most strong.  And that is Natalie Wynn ContraPoints.  Natalie is a fucking beacon when it comes to strength on the left.  She is what made me want to do YouTube in this capacity in the fucking first place.  I wasn't even going to bother with this stupid fucking medium if I didn't have to, if it wasn't for Natalie and her amazing ability to change people's minds.  When I started watching her videos, I didn't think that trans people were real.  I didn't think that it was an actual thing, I thought that it was just play acting.  I didn't get it, and now I do.  because of her videos.  And that says a lot because not only has it changed my opinion on various issues, I have actually used her videos to change the minds of actual fascists in real life.  Yeah, I did it with her videos.  I was actually able to make somebody who identifies as alt-right change their mind on if traps are gay or not, by letting them watch literally just one video from Natalie.  And it completely made them look at things from a different perspective.  And that is because not only her giving an incredibly detailed and well-thought-out argument, but because she did it while showing strength.  Strength can never be underestimated.  The same arguments have been made hundreds of times by hundreds of people in hundreds of different ways, and they didn't set.  And yet when Natalie does it, they do.  So great job, Natalie.  Holy fuck are you ever strong.  Excellent work and keep breaking those fucking little red pills in half.  Now, of course, I am going to give an honorable mention to Bo from the fifth column because he is basically my inspiration.  Every fucking day.  When I feel like I'm not entirely sure how I want to do a video, I watch one of his videos and then I kind of just try to copy what he does because it's fucking brilliant.  He has a way of talking to people that is direct and to the point and... in a way that is almost poetic, because he tends to use a form of argumentation tactics that is both relatable to people on the right, but also incredibly helpful to people on the left as far as language works, as far as our little insular languages work.  Bo can, as he's stated in the past, speak several different languages and I think that that is incredibly important for us on the left to be able to speak the language of the people on the right so we can actually communicate with them and maybe get them to look at things a bit differently, in a different way.  So without further ado, I want to give signal boosts to all of my good friends who are out there every single day putting in the work and trying to put out content to inform and entertain all of you lovely comrades.  Now, this is not a definitive list, and I'm going to link in the comment section below a pinned comment.  Yeah, that has a list of all of these YouTubers and any more that you can come up with, please leave it as a comment to or a response comment to that comment so we can actually have a good resource for people to just drop in, take a look, and subscribe to these channels.  Christopher Zabo, excellent, excellent YouTuber.  They do an incredible job.  Please check them out.  Leftist Tech Support is a community member in my Discord chat.  Please check out my Discord chat and also check out Leftist Tech Support.  They are fucking incredible and they have a great way of looking at things.  that is different from the way that I look at things because... I believe they're coming at it from a SOC dem or a dem SOC position.  I think that they're actually coming at it from an old school dem SOC position, which is really interesting to see how they come to different conclusions than what I do being an anarchist.  Visionary Oaks.  Visionary Oaks and I have gotten into arguments online that may or may not have been because I was at fault or maybe they were at fault or maybe we were both at fault because we were relying on different definitions for certain words and our inability to know what our definitions were in the first place ended up creating a great big argument.  That's fun.  And one of these days I'm going to do a video with Visionary Oaks and hopefully we can come to some decent conclusions on some other things.  Radical reviewer.  Radical reviewer is fucking dope.  Okay, he is a dog, a communist dog that reviews books.  I assume that it's actually a person with a dog as an avatar, but the way that they set up the show, it seems as though the dog is the one that's reviewing the books.  So I'm not going to destroy anybody's sense of illusion.  I'm not going to destroy that.  But yeah, radical reviewer.  does book reviews and they're fucking incredible.  And we've done a few collaborations in the past.  I hope that they want to do more in the future and please check them out.  Amelia Jane.  Listen, I'm sorry that I left you until now, but Amelia Jane is literally fucking incredible.  If you get a chance, check them out because their arguments are some of the best that I've seen on YouTube in years.  I'm jealous 90% of the time, every time they put out an argument, every time they put out a video.  I look at it, I watch it, and can't stop clapping every time because they just make every fucking point so perfectly.  So please check them out, Amelia Jane.  And finally, my boy, my good friend, one of the mods in my Discord chat, Ron.  Ron, you are fucking incredible, and your videos, especially the ones that have been coming out lately, they're called Ron's Quick Points.  Holy shit.  Every one that I have seen, I have been monumentally impressed by.  Ron is an incredibly cool, incredibly tough motherfucker that you do not want to mess with.  There's a reason why I have him as a mod in my Discord chat, and there is a reason why he calls himself the Attack Dog.  He is one tough motherfucker and you definitely want to subscribe to this guy because he's awesome.  Okay, so that is my signal boosts and my opinions on various different YouTubers.  I hope that you enjoyed watching this video.  Thank you very much for doing so.  My name is Aaron.  This is my show, Re-Education.  And yeah, thanks for watching. ",
