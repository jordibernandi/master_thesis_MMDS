            "text": "The state of Virginia is an absolute powder keg right now, and if something's gonna pop off, it's gonna be there.  What do I mean?  The government's turning on its people, that's what I mean.  Stick by, watch the next episode of Guns and Gadgets to get the info.

A lot of work goes into it here to keep you updated, so consider giving that subscribe to help this channel grow.  On to what's going on in Virginia.  It is coming From every angle.  We already know about the Second Amendment sanctuary cities and counties.  That movement has just blossomed.  It's taking off like crazy.  And it's just a statement to Governor Northam and these new incoming freshman legislators who are all going to be Democrats.  Just telling them that, you know, don't tread on me.  Stay off of our rights.  You do your stupid little job, but you're not taking our rights away.  And you've had all kinds of stuff happen in the last week.  It's been crazy.  But this is the latest.  The Democrats are coming out and showing their true colors.  A Virginia Democrat who's a state rep, his name is Jerry Connolly, had this to say regarding police departments or sheriff's departments that refuse to enforce the new unconstitutional tyrannical gun control laws that will come in January.  He said, Quote, I would hope they either resign in good conscience because they cannot uphold the law which they are sworn to uphold, or they're prosecuted for failure to fulfill their oath.  You know, the same oath that these clowns are breaking day in and day out, and they want to rip up the Constitution in January.  They forget about their oath, which says to uphold and defend the Constitution, right?  But it's okay for them.  But he continues.  He says, the law is the law.  If that becomes the law, you don't have a choice.  Not if you're a sworn officer of the law.  Well, Representative, you're about to... You're about to be educated in January.  Also, the governor came out and said there will be consequences if police departments and sheriff's departments don't enforce the new laws come January, and it won't stop there.  Democrat Virginia Rep.  Donald McEachin, or McEachin, don't know, don't care, because he sounds like an ass, he said this in regards to Second Amendment sanctuary counties and cities.  They certainly risk funding.  Because if the sheriff's department is not going to enforce the law, they're going to lose money.  The county's attorney's offices are not going to have the money to prosecute because their prosecutions are going to go down.  Actually, no, there's plenty of crime because laws are supposed to focus on criminals.  not law-abiding citizens, there's plenty of crime going around that they can still keep up exactly what they're doing now.  In fact, they should start arresting some of you criminals.  Now, this same Bobo McEachern had another bright idea, and that was sending in the National Guard to enforce gun control and to take guns.  Now he said this, I'll quote it.  Ultimately, I'm not the governor, but the governor may have to nationalize the National Guard to enforce the law.  That's his call because I don't know how serious these counties are and how severe the violations of law will be, but that's obviously an option he has.  and the violations of law would be the violations you all are going to be doing in January on the Constitution.  Yeah, those ones.  Now, if you are a member of the National Guard in Virginia or you know somebody who is a member of the National Guard in Virginia, please do me a favor.  I'll have a right there floating around and in the description.  I did a video a couple weeks ago called Oathbreakers versus Oathkeepers and it was addressing law enforcement with red flag laws.  Please send them that video because the National Guard If this is going to happen, they need to pass that woman in the mirror test and decide what side they're on.  Are you on the side of the country and the Constitution as your oath demands?  Or are you siding with the tyrants?  And if you do that, then you are one of them as well.  Now I'll add that this is the same governor, Governor Northam, who dressed in blackface and said, oh no, that was a joke.  He vetoed two bills that the Republicans had put through to stop sanctuary cities and sanctuary counties for illegal immigrants, illegal aliens.  He put a stop to that.  See, that's okay.  You can be illegal and drain America But you can't be a sanctuary for the law-abiding and the Constitution, because that's terrible.  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't have to tell you that if Virginia follows through with their threats and their demands, and they force unconstitutional gun control and try to send in the National Guard and pull funding by those who are protecting the rights of their citizens in their counties, There's gonna be a whole new experience for them.  If it's gonna start, the next revolution starts in Virginia.  Please pass this along.  I hope and pray that all of my brothers and sisters in Virginia get to see this.  I know, I know that you all are prepared to do what's necessary.  If I can be of help somehow getting the word out for you, whether it's the Virginia Civil Defense League, or any other group, please let me know.  I'll also tell you that there's a link in the description to virginiaconservatives.net where they have a petition going to recall Governor Northam, okay?  He's violating the Constitution.  He's telling you what he's going to do to those who want to protect and serve and enforce and uphold the Constitution like their oaths say.  So he needs to be removed.  Thank you for your time.
