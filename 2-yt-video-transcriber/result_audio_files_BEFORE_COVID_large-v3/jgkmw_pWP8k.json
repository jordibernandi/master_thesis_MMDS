            "text": "We're missing it educationally because we've never sat down and discussed the historical relationship between us and the educational system in this country.  Remember the educational system was designed on a public policy that has gone in a complete circle, 360 degrees.  First of all, we were denied education.  Then we moved from a denied educational basis to a desegregated education prior to the Civil War.  Then we moved after the Civil War into segregated education.  Then by the 1950s, we went back to desegregated education, and now we're back into a state of denial of education.  Then I'm going to talk about quota, I mean, dismantling the school system, going to voucher systems, going to some kind of private school system.  What that means, Darrell, is that black folk fail to understand that schools are not change agents.  They're only doing what the environment wants them to do.  Schools in this country, starting in the 1860s, were designed to create a manual labor force for whites, society period.  Black folk became obsolete in the mid-1960s.  They no longer need us as a labor class.  So, therefore, the schools are dysfunctional because they no longer need black folk.  If we really want to make our schools functional, we have to come up with a national public policy about what we want our schools to do for us. ",

Suppose right now we want to, let's say if we had a national public policy on black folk, just as whites have always had a national public policy on us.  They've had a policy on us, but we never had one for ourselves.  What is it we want to do as black folk?  Suppose right now we want to go to the moon.  Then once we decide where we want to go in a public policy, then it becomes incumbent upon all those educators and all those school systems to say, now what must our school systems do in terms of instilling in our kids the attitudes, the skills, the competencies to be able to get us to the moon?
