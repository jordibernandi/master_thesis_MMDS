What's your name and badge number?  Are you videotaping license plates?  That's what my call is.  I'm going to call you right now.  Okay?  If you come out here and you even tell me I can't record something from a public easement, I'm going to hold you liable under Chapter 21, Title 42, United States Code, Section 1983 and 1985 for conspiracy.  You're dismissed.  Oh, I'm dismissed?  You're dismissed.  Really?  Okay.  Okay.  I'm pretty sure.  I just asked a question.  No, no more questions.  I don't answer questions.  No more questions.  Okay.  All I'm asking is... I want an attorney present.  Okay.  I want an attorney present for any questions that you have.  All I'm asking is just don't cause a disturbance for the people, okay?  I don't care what you're asking.  You're dismissed.  I'm going to go talk to him again.  Let me see what's going on here.  Have a good day.  This is going to be fun.  This is going to be fun.  Stand with her, please.  Sir, you work here?  Yes, sir.  Who's Paul Summer?  He is, up front.  Nice to see him, yeah.  Hey, Paul, how are you?  How do you party, sir?  Just... There's really nothing that we can do either.  she's on a sidewalk public public property.  Nothing really we can do.  She honestly doesn't want to hear anything that we have to say.  Of course not.  Not really doing anything wrong.  She's allowed to do whatever she wants.  Freedom of speech, obviously.  Right.  I'm going to ask him again to tone it down a little bit.  Try not to... I'm not even worried about that.  Just move it down.  She's got a video.  I just don't want her videoing my customers coming in and out.  That's all.  We don't care.  She's done it before.  Has she?  Oh, yeah.  You want to know the funny part?  She's never bought a car from us.  Yeah, I get it.  I don't even know.  What's it do with the sign?  I'm not understanding.  Is this something about elderly views?  We sold her parents a Ford Focus like three years ago.  Her parents didn't want to make the payments anymore.  Yeah.  And I don't even think she's a she.  I think she's a he.  So... I think so, too.  Um... And so she comes by whenever she's bored out in Satsuma, because that's where they're from.  She drives all the way over from Satsuma and just protests.  So we don't mind.  But we just don't want to video her.  Because they came to us.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have called.  Because you go out there and talk to her.  She doesn't want to talk to you.  She just videos you and throws the video camera at you.  Yeah, I know.  Trust me, I know.  It's pretty much what I just dealt with.  Technically, she's not doing anything wrong.  You know that.  I told her to tone it down.  If not, just move down.  Yeah, I'll see what I can do.  All right.  Uh, so am I. So, pretty much, uh, apparently this person's parents bought a car from them, like, three years ago.  Um, she couldn't make the payments.  They did something with the car, and this guy's just upset.  He's upset.  They're upset, or?  He's upset.  Yeah.  They keep calling it.  She's, I don't really know.  Oh.  Whatever.  Um, I didn't do anything wrong.  I, I, I didn't, I wasn't creating a speech, bro.  He's on public property.  I didn't do anything wrong.  Did he give you a name?  No, but he needs to provide his identification.  This is going to be fun.  Alright, so here's where we're at.  I don't care what you have to say.  You don't care what I have to say.  Okay, I do need you to provide me information.  I'm not going to give you ID.  You actually have to.  What crime do you suspect me of?  There is no crime.  Okay, so in Florida, if there is no crime, then I do not have to identify myself.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm not going to ID.  I totally, 100,000% refuse.  I have not committed a crime.  You cannot articulate a crime.  You just said it in front of 27 people that I didn't commit a crime.  If I have not committed a crime, then I do not need to ID.  Bye-bye.  I am not going to identify myself.  Get it through your head.  Okay.  Under Florida State statute, you do have to identify yourself.  I am not going to identify myself for the last time.  I refuse to say it.  Well, you need to provide one.  Well, I'm not going to.  I don't have ID on me anyway, so.  It is a crime.  If you refuse to provide your identification that I've requested of you, it is a crime.  Okay.  Then you'll be held liable under 42 U.S.C.  Section 1983.  You're going to arrest me right now.  Go ahead.  Do it.  I dare you.  I am not going to give you my ID.  Ma'am, why are you getting upset right now?  I am not going to give you my ID.  You have zero chance of you getting my ID.  Can I ask why you're raising your voice?  You're coming at me.  You have three deep right now, which is an intimidation against my rights.  It is an intimidation against my rights.  42 USC section 1983 for violation of first and 14th article five under the 14th amendment civil rights.  You guys want to play games.  I'm telling you right now, I can process this.  You're going to lose your qualified immunity.  I don't want to talk to you.  Get the hell away from me.  We're here because somebody called.  I don't care why you're here.  It does not matter.  It does not matter.  I'm here for an investigation.  I don't care what you're here for.  It does matter.  Well, I'm not going to give you ID.  Okay, you're going to listen to me now.  No, I'm not going to listen to you right now.  I don't give a rat's ass what you have to say.  So you can say whatever you want, but you're on.  You're fine to be here and do what you're.  I know I'm fine to be here and do what I'm doing and I'm not going to ID to you.  And I don't really care what you have to say.  I'm going to talk over you because what you have to say is really unimportant to me.  So I'm going to continue to talk over you.  What you're saying is a waste of time.  I can't even understand you.  So just piss off and get lost.  I don't really care what you have to say.  Get lost.  I don't care what you have to say.  Get lost. ",
