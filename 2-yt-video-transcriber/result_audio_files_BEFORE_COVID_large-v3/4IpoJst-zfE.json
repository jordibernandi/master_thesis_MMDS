            "text": "Ow.  Hello, everyone, and welcome to The Vortex, where lies and falsehoods are trapped and exposed.  I'm Michael Voris.  If you keep your ears open and look for the comparisons, they are extremely clear.  There is a war being waged in the two capitals of the world, Washington,  D.C.,  and Rome, in other words, the United States and the Catholic Church.  In each capital, the war is being waged by essentially the same forces on each side, the little people and the elites who live in the swamp.  And while we're highlighting the comparisons, a major one is the behind-the-scenes funding for each war, George Soros.  While George is certainly not the only sinister agent bankrolling the rise and dominance of the left, his billions and how he allocates them has catapulted him into the role of poster boy.  And to be certain, Soros' efforts are not merely symbolic or ceremonial.  He is a driving force of all things leftist in the worlds of both church and state.  Enormous sums of his wind their way through all sorts of institutions and nonprofits set up specifically established to rip control of Western civilization away from more traditional understandings and lead it to the broad sunlit uplands of socialism.  And when we speak of Western Civilization, we're speaking in broad terms, meaning the established principles and customs governing the West, which were introduced and advanced by the Catholic Church.  So when Soros or his buddies strike at the Church or the United States or both, they are taking aim squarely at Western Civilization.  Sometimes they even get a double bang for their buck, like when they helped fund the Center for American Progress, the organization headed up by John Podesta, Hillary's campaign director, in 2016.  Recall the WikiLeaks dump, which revealed that a chief aim of the cap was to destabilize the Catholic Church and get Catholics to vote for Obama in 2008 and 12, as well as Hillary in 2016.  You can easily call that a twofer, subvert the church, and get your socialist friends elected to the White House, all with just one donation.  Pretty slick.  Until it all came out, as we said in the 2016 WikiLeaks dump, emails back and forth between Podesta and other swamp types openly discussing how to destabilize the church were all exposed.  The similarities between the swamp in DC and the one in Rome are a bit breathtaking to behold.  The swamp monsters in each town have almost total control of all established media outlets.  They each promote a type of socialism which relies on people being completely uninformed and uneducated.  In the D.C.  swamp, this was done by seizing control of the education system and turning out unthinking zombies.  In Rome, in the Rome swamp, this was done by seizing control of religious education, primary schools, high schools, CCD, and Catholic colleges, and turning out uninformed zombies.  Each swamp relies heavily on painting their agendas in the most friendly terms.  In Rome, mercy for all.  In  D.C.,  Medicare for all.  In Rome, forgiveness of all spiritual debt, whether you ask for it or not.  In  D.C.,  forgiveness of all college debt, whether you ask for it or not.  In both swamps, there exists a deep state that has been busy for decades undermining the identity and self-understanding of the respective capital.  Each swamp is absolutely dedicated to complete and total destruction of their enemies, those who oppose their cultural or religious poison.  Each swamp produces big, meaningless spectacles to try and pull the wool over people's eyes.  In DC, first it was Comey-Comey, then Russia-Russia, and now it's Impeachment-Palooza.  In Rome, first it was the Synods on the Family, then the Sex Summit, now the Amazonian Synod.  In each capital, the spectacles are charades meant to arrive at a predetermined outcome, but pretending they are just listening and dialoguing and gathering all the facts.  Each capital's swamps can't resist the urge to blather on about climate change and immigrants, the death penalty, gun control, reading as they are from the same Soros paid-for script.  America is a threat to the goals of the left because it still stands for everything that America is identified with.  And while huge strides have been made by Marxists in America, a recent poll revealed that close to 90% of Americans still believe in America as the country is traditionally understood.  The church is a threat to the goals of the left because the left supports evil disguised as good, and too many in the church refuse to let that evil go unchecked. ",
