            "text": "In the book of Romans, the apostle Paul taught us something about the kingdom of God.  And he said in verse 17 of chapter 14, he said, the kingdom of God is not meat or drink, but it's righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.  The kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy.  Righteousness is God's answer to the sin problem.  Peace is God's answer to the torment problem.  And joy is his answer to the sickness problem.  And laughter, laughter is good medicine.  And so the kingdom represents a triune healing for the whole person.  Spirit, soul, and body.  In fact, the word evil in the Lord's Prayer to deliver us from evil, of course evil refers to sin, but it comes from a word that means pain.  And that word comes from a word that means poor.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And so we have.  sin, sickness, and poverty were all dealt with with a redemptive brushstroke of Jesus, the shedding of his blood.  Never again were those three areas to ever have authority over a believer's life again.  Thank you.  In Ephesians chapter two, it says that Jesus bore on his body the dividing wall.  So think about this with me.  Jew and Gentile, there's never been a group of people more diverse or separate than those two.  There's the haves and the have-nots.  And Jesus took and bore on his flesh the dividing wall between these two groups.  That means he has destroyed the power of division.  I don't care if it's a family division, if it's a division in a business, if it's a racial division, if it's a division that's political, doesn't matter what it is, Jesus bore the brunt of the power of division to the cross and it was dismembered.  Which means when we pray in communion, we have the authority to declare an end to division in any situation that we know of.  Because He took care of it.  In the same way that He settled the issue of sin, so He settled the issue of division.  So it says that He bore our sickness and our pain to the cross.  The Father poured out His wrath upon His Son.  Why would He do that?  Because his son became sin.  Jesus became sin so we could become righteous.  So he took, if you can imagine, sickness, disease, pain, poverty, evil, all the junk.  He wore it on his own flesh.  The father poured out his wrath.  and killed his own son.  Jesus became a curse so that you and I wouldn't have to bear the curse.  You'll hear people say, well, this sickness, whatever it might be, is just a curse.  It is, but Jesus became a curse so we wouldn't have to bear the curse.  He actually became sin and took the wrath of the Father in our place so that we would be qualified for forgiveness, qualified for deliverance, qualified for unity, qualified for healing, qualified for blessing and increase.  The redemptive work of Jesus is to heal the whole person. ",
