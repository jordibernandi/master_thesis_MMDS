But I was talking to an event organizer who has set up a number of events for Dawkins, and he shared with me privately, Bill, it has nothing to do with you personally.  It's that Dawkins will not get into a debate or dialogue with a philosopher.  because he knows he's out of his field, he's out of his depth.  And so he assiduously avoids ever getting into a dialogue with a philosopher. ",

Daniel Cain, again a British philosopher, wrote a public editorial denouncing Dawkins for his excuses, the phony excuses he was offering, rather than participating in this.  So when I spoke in Oxford University at the Sheldonian Theatre, it was billed as a debate with Richard Dawkins.  And in the weeks preceding the debate, the Christian organizers rented banners that were on the sides of the buses, driving all around Oxford, saying, there probably is no Dawkins.  Now, quit worrying and enjoy October 25th at the Sheltonian Theater.  And we had a chair for Dawkins right up to the last minute, waiting for him to show up.  And of course, he didn't.  So we had great fun. ",
