And if Hezbollah warriors were coming into Metula.  Because they were planning to attack Metula.  Back home I have two children and a dog, actually a puppy.  And just to think what could happen if some, what could happen to my family, to my house, to my home.  This is something that make you think more than once about how is to live over here.  Yes, it's a beautiful place.  And thanks to the army, to Israel army, it's safe here.  Our neighbors not behave like us.  They don't acting like us and they don't thinking like us.  They're thinking how to kill us and how to take over our land and our houses and homes.  And this is something that... You have to keep remembering all the time and never forget.  We have to keep going.  We have to keep going.  And we will build this orchard again.  And I invite you to come back in another five years.  And we will go together to pick a new apple from the new orchard over there.  And I really, really hope that in five years from now, we will make a different story about a different life and a more comfortable life like you have back home in the U.S ",
