            "text": "Think about it, Blaise Pascal asks.  If there is no God, whether you believe in him or not, you stand to lose merely finite pleasures.  You know, ten minutes of grovelling here and there, getting up early on a Sunday, and once in a while nodding along to a quite frankly terrifying sermon.  In this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed!  But if there is a God, and you believe in him, you stand to gain infinite pleasure and avoid infinite suffering .  Given this, Pascal argues, you ought to wager that God exists.  That, my fellow apes, is Pascal's Wager, and this is the first in a series titled Objections to Pascal's Wager.  Now you might be thinking, Steve, bro, you've already covered this argument.  You're beating a dead horse.  Why not make a series on logical fallacies, for example?  In reply, I say, yes, you're right, and in time I will make that series.  But before doing so, I'm going to revisit my roots, but this time rip them entirely from the ground.  I want to remaster, expand, and energise my older videos, and in the process make the series that my younger self so craved.  At least, that's the plan.  Hence, over the next few months, I'm going to dedicate a series to each of the major arguments for theism, in which I'll delve deeply into the objections and defences given.  With that, I'm Stephen Woodford.  Thank you for joining me.  And this is All on God. ",
