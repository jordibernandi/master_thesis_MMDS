            "text": "Speaking to a farmer from Ohio, his name is Christopher Gibbs, and he is a soybean farmer from Ohio.  Now, if you know anything about the soybean market, you know that the largest purchaser of soybeans on the global market is China.  They have a real thing for soy products, like tofu.  He says he voted for Trump, Mr.  Gibbs did, in 2016, but he spoke to CNN yesterday morning, and in the interview he said he is no longer, quote, on the Trump train, end quote.  See, Trump is really hurting farmers across America.  Now, I have made light of that.  And I'll continue to do so because I think anybody who voted for Trump is a fucking idiot.  I realize that rural voters and farmers especially tend towards the Republican Party.  Okay.  Trump is not a Republican.  Trump is a fucking fascist who has no interest.  He has nobody's interest at heart except his own and his fucked up family.  That's it.  And I doubt if he really is concerned that much about his family.  So the people who, the farmers who tend to vote Republican anyway, no matter what, which again, I think is just fucking insane when you have a liberal Democrat who has to come and bail you out.  I'm talking about Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp.  When you have people who have to put on fucking concerts to save your ass, to save your farm from the policies of the people you elected.  What the fuck is wrong with you, farmers?  These pigs don't have your interest at heart.  So Trump is devastating farmers across the country and the Republican Party is letting him do it.  Anyway, the CNN piece explains American farmers have been unable to sell their products on the world market because of Trump's fucking insanity.  And now are facing increased bankruptcies as a result.  I almost want to feel sorry for him.  But there's something in me that just won't.  That says, you dumb motherfuckers.  You voted for Trump.  You gave him the rope to wrap around your neck and hang you.  And you didn't know what he was?  And I do?  I'm not a farmer.  I sit in this fucking studio and do this podcast.  But I knew.  And you didn't?  Bullshit.  You voted for Trump.  I don't know why.  But now, you farmers will get this.  As ye sow, so shall ye reap.  Eh?  Gibbs, the farmer in Ohio, also took issue with Trump referring to farmers as great patriot farmers.  That's what Trump called them on Tuesday.  His way of defending his rotten, fucked up, failed policies.  Oh, our great.  That sounds like something goddamn Khrushchev would have said or Stalin when he was finished killing farmers.  Our great patriot for the fatherland or no Russia, the motherland.  Farmer Gibbs said, to me that's just a design to make me continue to be quiet, and I'm not going to be quiet.  Being a patriot is this, I've got to protect my family, end quote.  Yeah, okay, why would this farmer think he had to be quiet?  I think we understand why.  Peer pressure, maybe?  I don't know.  Senator Tom Cotton, that tall, skinny, beanpole fucker from Arkansas?  also invoked patriotism to defend these Trump tariffs.  See what these sons of bitches do?  If you voice opposition, if your farm is going under, if you're about to have to file bankruptcy, if you can't sell your crops and you make a fucking sound, you're not being patriotic.  And that's what Farmer Gibbs means when he says, I'm not going to be quiet.  Tom Cotton claimed that farmers suffering from the trade wars were, quote, this is Tom Cotton who's not a farmer, that farmers were, quote, willing to bear some of the sacrifices in the short term, end quote, and those sacrifices are minimal, according to Cotton, compared to, quote, the sacrifices soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines make around the world, end quote.  This motherfucker invokes the U.S.  military to compare to 50-, 60-, 70-year-old farmers busting their fucking asses, trying to make a living, and then you have this shit like Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a senator.  Comparing these hardworking farmers, and they are hardworking, did they fuck up voting for Trump?  In my opinion, yes.  But for some weaselly, skinny little fuck like Tom Cotton to say to the farmers, suck it up, boys.  Comparing them to soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen?  You miserable son of a bitch, you.  Cotton.  So the interviewer from CNN asked Farmer Gibbs about Cotton's remarks.  She said, you're speaking out against a trade war.  Is that unpatriotic, Christopher?  Farmer Gibbs replied, no, it's certainly not unpatriotic at all.  I'm certainly not going to have my patriotism questioned.  And I'm not sure why the president's even bringing this up.  For me, to be a patriot, the best thing I can do is take care of my family, to take care of my farm, and to make sure I stay viable.  Coming out of the ether, Farmer Gibbs, are you?  Your patriotism is questioned?  because you're raising a little bit of shit because you're about to lose your farm, your business, your family, your livelihood, and maybe, God forbid this should happen, you might be like one of the farmers back in the 80s when this happened again and hang yourself in the barn.  Don't let that happen, Farmer Gibbs.  It ain't worth it.  But this is what this fucking Trump does.  This is exactly what Hitler did.  Trump is Hitler.  Hitler is Trump.  If you complain, you're not being patriotic.  If you're a woman and you want to control your own body, you're not being a Christian.  You dirty fuckers.  You Christian conservative animals.  Jesus Christ.  Farmer Gibbs also pointed out that when they're able to freely sell their products on the global market, farmers buy American products like steel in the form of tractors and harvesters and combines and all kinds of shit.  Trump has claimed his trade war is defending the American steel industry, but it's actually had harmful effects for farmers and a wide variety of American businesses.  And it's going to continue, because Trump's ego is in it now.  Trump has a chance to stand belly to belly with the leader of the biggest country on Earth, Xi Jinping, or whatever the fuck his name is, I don't care.  And Trump gets to stand on the world stage as if he had power, which all of a sudden he does.  Farmer Gibbs said this also in the interview with CNN, quote, Why the farming community has to take one in the shorts just so the president can have a talking point and be tough on China is just a little bit beyond me, end quote.  Well, it's beyond you, Farmer Gibbs, because you haven't been paying attention.  And if you're a farmer in America in the year 2019 on planet Earth and you're not paying attention, you are doomed.  You have global warming working against you.  You have floods, you have tornadoes, you have droughts, all of which have increased exponentially in the past 20, 25 years.  And you also have a political system now that is determined to grind you down.  Farmer Gibbs, you don't understand.  And I know you're not listening.  I'm just pretending you are.  You don't seem to understand that.  Donald Trump doesn't give a fuck if you live or die.  And all the independent farmers like you, he don't have anything to do with you.  He wants the big agrarian combine, the big hedge fund operated feedlots and farms that load up with glyphosate, all kinds of poisons and shit where it's run out of some fucking office in midtown Manhattan.  Farmer Gibbs, you better wake up and smell the fertilizer because Trump wants you dead.  Figuratively and literally.  He wants you the fuck out of the way.  He wants to make sure you're going to be silent.  And then CNN has this.  The trade war has hurt American industry, particularly farmers, which is why many have been speaking out against the wrong-headed policy.  Farmers, it's not a wrongheaded policy.  It was a wrongheaded move on your part.  When you voted for a lying, pussy-grabbing, cheating, bankrupting, filthy son of a bitch who made it clear he couldn't speak normal American English, he had no grasp of any fucking issue, he spent his whole fucking campaign shouting, lock her up and build the wall, and you voted for him.  You voted for this fucker.  So now, when what Trump is hits you in the fucking shorts, as you put it, Farmer Gibbs, you're going to act surprised?  But I thought that, you know, farmers and small businesses were the salt of the earth.  I mean, Woody Guthrie and John Mellencamp and all these populist singers over the years talking about the Okies and the farmers and struggling to make it on the land.  Like you, Farmer Gibbs.  And Willie Nelson built a second career helping people, farmers.  And you're going to blame it on Trump's policies?  Trump's policies?  There are no policies.  You're dealing with Trump.  Trump doesn't have a fucking policy about anything.  He has toxic, malignant narcissism out of which he operates the presidency of the United States.  So no, it's not a wrong-headed policy, Farmer Gibbs.  It was your wrong-headed decision to vote for this cocksucker.  And what, you're going to do it again?  Trump thinks you are.  What, 16 months?  You're going to do it again, Farmer Gibbs?  He'll tell you that you're going to have a beautiful soybean crop.  Oh, it's going to be gorgeous.  And you're going to make more money.  You're going to be throwing money away.  You're going to make so much of it.  Oh, and don't forget the tax cuts.  You're going to go for it again, Farmer Gibbs?  A lot of Americans are going to go for it again.  And when Trump and his fellow travelers start arguing about patriotism as a way to shut people up, it's a clear indication that they can't defend their so-called policies on the merits.  Tom Cotton, that skinny beanpole fucker telling farmers to suck it up and think about the sacrifices made by Marines, why does Tom Cotton say that?  Arkansas, one of the poorest fucking states in the Union, Because cotton can't defend anything that Trump or this filthy Republican Party has done.  Except one thing.  Protecting fetuses.  So Farmer Gibbs, the next time you're worried about Trump's policies, as you put it, keep in mind that While you may go bankrupt and your family may dissolve in a pool of unpaid bills and anxiety and fear, the folks in Alabama, the women in Alabama, won't be able to kill their unborn children.  Maybe that will help pay your notes at the bank.  You think?  I do feel sorry for Farmer Gibbs and people like him.  I really do.  It's hard for me, though, to think of people who are adults, they vote, Farmers have to pay attention to not just the weather, which is one of the main things they pay attention to, or the futures market, which is another main thing they pay, the commodities future market, but also the politicians.  They're going to be making public policy that affects them directly.  I'm not affected directly by a farming policy or a trade policy because I don't shop at Walmart.  I don't shop at all, period, unless maybe once in a while I need a new pair of fucking blue jeans.  But farmers, supposedly, because of the work they do and the life they live, they have to know, is the person I'm voting for going to protect me as a farmer?  And farmers need protection now.  We're in a global market, regardless of what Trump says.  Is the person I vote for, the county level, the state level, the federal level, the presidency, are these people going to protect me as a farmer so I can get about my business?  Are they going to keep markets open so I can sell my product?  Are they going to work with the National Weather Service to help me understand what kind of weather is coming?  Are they going to do this or that or this or that?  I don't give a fuck about fetuses.  What I care about are the policies of the person I'm going to vote for.  Now, that's what I always thought farmers did.  I grew up in northwest Ohio.  With the exception of Toledo, where I grew up, it's all farming country.  Soybeans, corn, truck farming.  So yeah, I feel sad for Farmer Gibbs.  Even though Farmer Gibbs, along with every other farm family in America who voted for Trump, you brought this on yourself.  Hi, Truthseekers.
