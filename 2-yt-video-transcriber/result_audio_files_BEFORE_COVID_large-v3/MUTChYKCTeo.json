I mean, literally, why is it that we have to spend so much time Calling out the media for stuff that's \u2013 I mean you're literally calling Tulsi Gabbard over and over again a traitor for no goddamn reason.  because what?  Hillary Clinton said it?  Hillary Clinton, the person who went from being the president's wife to being a senator.  very corrupt, everything we've talked about, to failing to run and losing against a game show host.  That's the person that we want to take extra serious.  The person that we don't want to take serious is the person who has the highest level of security clearance, is on all the boards in Congress, has served the country for 16 years as a soldier, who has been in Congress for so long, who... put her entire everything in jeopardy by going against Hillary Clinton, which I think is the real crime here, that this isn't discussed.  And I really do wish Tulsi would bring it up more, that the real crime that Tulsi Gabbard has committed is thinking independently and speaking out and acting according to her own moral system.  Now, I may not agree with everything Tulsi does, but overall, she's doing a fine job at what she's doing.  And people need to lay off her.  I mean, come on.  This is what she's getting.  This is a Congresswoman who is currently in the armed forces and it's just like, When Hillary Clinton was running in 2016, the biggest weakness that they found with Hillary Clinton was poll testing, of course, her Russian connections or the perceived Russian connections, depending on how you want to look at them.  So what did she do?  She hit Trump with Russia connections, and we're still feeling the results of that to this day.  So to Joy Behar out there, come on.  You're supposed to be one of the lucid ones on The View.  I'm usually yelling at Meghan McCain.  Not you.  Get your shit together.  Anyway, this is Daniel with Hard Lens Media.
