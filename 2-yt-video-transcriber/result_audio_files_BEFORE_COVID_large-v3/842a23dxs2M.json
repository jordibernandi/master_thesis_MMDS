            "text": "Hey, minifash, it's the 5th of June, 2019.  I may not get this up tonight, I'm gonna try, because it has to do a lot with what's going on tomorrow, on the 6th.  You have this Jerusalem March for Pride going on tomorrow, okay?  The same time that you have the D-Day.  in France with Trump and all the dignitaries, all the bigwigs, all the so on and so forth.  They're going to be there, right?  So at first when I saw this article, it was earlier today, and I read it, it was really coming across my spirit as something wicked.  this way comes.  This is the same theme that we've been hearing loud and clear.  is this equal rights and liberty and equality.  It's just an insane time to be alive.  they're trying to achieve, are the same things that everybody else wants.  We all want liberty and equal rights and all these things, and they're not the only ones being persecuted, that's for sure.  But nonetheless, it's all driven by this pride.  This is all we see everywhere.  Pride, pride, pride.  Trump is the pride of America.  Israel, the pride of Israel.  And these people, the pride of whatever they're proud of.  But I'm telling you straight up that pride is not a good thing.  So I started taking these notes and a lot of things started just kind of like pouring out of this.  So they're having this on tomorrow and it's their 18th birthday.  pride parade which you know.  we know how to place the eighteen together which is also a nine a number of judgment the six six six.  okay they're looking for liberty but they don't specify.  you want legitimate liberty.  no you want licentious liberty.  That's what the world wants, okay?  Now, this is just kind of jumbled up here, so hopefully, you know, these notes help you.  They help me, I can tell you that, because this stuff just comes in, and I try the best I can to put it together to share with you what I'm being shown here.  But they begin this pride march at Liberty Bell Park.  Liberty Bell Park in Jerusalem.  And again, the licentious liberty of Baal.  Bell.  Bell.  Liberty of the flesh.  Do what thou wilt will lead you to death.  Legitimate liberty.  leads to life.  You can read about that in James 1.  You can read about it in many places, but this is just the way it is.  So I wound up, oh, look at this, the parade route.  Wait till you see this, okay?  They have these ramps. ",
