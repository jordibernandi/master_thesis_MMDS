He lost a lot of people that he actually loved and cared about.  But the darkest element I always felt from the first time I watched Forrest Gump was the relationship he had with Jenny.  And how Forrest was always there for her.  but how in the end he actually got the worst of Jenny.  He didn't actually get the best of Jenny when they were both young adults and both at the prime of their life.  And for me that is the saddest element in Forrest Gump.  Yes I know I've made videos about this before but this is a modern one because the first ones were bad for some reason.  And here is a clip I used last year using Family Guy making the same point. ",

            "text": "And how sad is that truly, that he's there in the end, by himself, taking care of the child.  After through most of his young life, and even elements of his adult life, he had been there for her.  And in the end, yes, he got a child.  Some would say he got the best out of her, but did he really?  That I've always seen as the darkest element in Forrest Gump, and I wonder how many men have actually had that same experience in their life.  Not exactly the same experience as Forrest Gump, but the experience of knowing a woman so much through their lives, and... have been there so much for her.  but in the end she went off and chased so many other things that didn't actually end up better for her.  and then in the end they came back to that man and how that man basically got what was left of her.  it's not in a sense of saying anything bad.  it's a sense of think of how a man would see it In that aspect as well.  And think of how some men would feel.  And think of how men would see it as well.  Some men would see it and feel like they have been... In some ways taken for a fool.  Because they had wanted her when she was in her prime.  But she did not want them.  But then it's the actual... let's say, gall, the cheek of it, to then come back.  And yes, many men, obviously, the desperation and the need and the want, and for many men, the fear of being single, of course, they will take upon a woman that has come back to them many, many years later.  But it's the sad case of how for many men they see it as an insult.  And for the few men that do see it as an insult, it's the fact of feeling that they were not seen as being good enough at that time.  They were not good enough then, but why are they good enough now?  The sort of thing.  And more than likely a lot of these men would have advanced themselves in their lives, had actually built a life for themselves.  So they would feel that, of course you're not interested in me, you are interested in what I have.  The fact I have built up myself so much when before you saw me as not being anything great.  You saw me as maybe being a nerd or boring or lame or not fun and edgy enough or not having enough swag.  Whatever the numerous things a woman would say to a man like the Forrest Gump situation.  how in some sense you'd see that she'd pity him and not actually not saying that she did not love him to some aspect but it was more a sense of for most of the time she saw him as a sort of a brother or a sort of friend, a male friend.  And in the end she sort of pitied him, though she gave herself to him in some sort of pitying sort of way.  So it is this I've always seen as the sad and dark element of Forrest Gump, and also a truth that I believe many men go through every single day, but always remember and never forget.  It is very easy for a desperate man to take the pity that is being given to him and shown to him.  But many times those situations can lead you into a place you wish you had never gone.  Because to respect yourself you would ask the question, why was I not good enough then and why am I now?  It's a sense of observing, to be focused and to remember.  the world is yours.  have a nice day hello.  so I'm currently recording some more videos or editing some more videos but there are some next to my head right here for you to watch in the meantime.
