            "text": "Our man has come here to speak with you, and you must listen to what you must do.  If you hit Earth by more degrees, then human life will be history.  Your dirty oil must stay in the ground, and a common's foot and not sky-bound.  You are polluters of this fair earth, like babies strangled at their birth.  We are going to some major oil companies offices around central London and delivering a speech, a declaration of how we think they should change their ways immediately.  You know I've dealt with a lot of men, so I'm giving it to you between the eyes.  Your dirty oil will kill us all.  Kill us all!  Kill us all!  We have 5,000 legalists, so it's all about outreach.  We want to tell Londoners that in our midst there are these, some of them slightly shady companies, we don't really know they're there, they're in posh looking buildings.  We want Londoners to know that we are in a climate and ecological emergency.  Leave the oil in the ground in Mother Nature's embrace or else come out and show your face.  Come on, it says your name, Repsol.  We have come here today to deliver our message to all the employees and directors of BP.  2020 must be the year in which we turn around the curve of rising emissions.  The year in which they must peak and then sharply decline until we reach zero carbon.  The time is now!  We are the generation that will succeed or fail to solve runaway climate and ecological breakdown.  cease to explore for the fossil fuels that will surely heat the planet to uninhabitable levels and join us in turning the ship around.  and may I say stop getting in our artistic spaces that you're getting into our cultural spaces and that's why we are going to go on to the Royal Opera House tonight.  we will now deliver The book, ironically named, This is Not a Drill, get it?  To BP.  Extinction Rebellion!  Extinction Rebellion!  Extinction Rebellion!  Extinction Rebellion!  Do you see?  Do you see?  Do you see your addiction to this filthy crud?  It isn't clever, it's bloody rude So short-sighted, greedy and mean To take down a planet or living things.  It will end common, she knows that's true But it will also be the end of you.  The man won't let you, she will resist.  For the planet, she'll make you desist. ",
