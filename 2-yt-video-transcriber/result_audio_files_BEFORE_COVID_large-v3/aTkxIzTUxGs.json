            "text": "This video is sponsored by Skillshare.  A few years ago, I realized that I needed to make some changes in my life.  Without getting too specific, I wasn't taking good care of myself mentally or physically, and I had a lot of really counterproductive and often destructive habits.  Now, I'm usually good at recognizing problems in my life and developing solutions to them, but I often need to seek advice or do some research.  And at that time, I needed to find a way to do that.  that was free.  So around about that time, I became interested in self-help and personal development content.  I'd check out books from the library, I'd watch YouTube videos, anything to get some pointers on how to improve myself.  A lot of people describe the entire self-help industry as a huge scam.  This idea that these so-called life coaches and motivational speakers offer misleading or incomplete information that doesn't actually help anyone.  And supposedly people pay their hard-earned money for these books and seminars while getting nothing of value in return.  You might argue that if self-help content worked, then the self-help industry itself would eventually have no purpose.  Now I'm still working on a lot of things, but I've definitely improved myself in many important ways over the years.  I can't definitively say that the content I consumed is part of the reason why, but I will say that many of the ideas that were shared to this day seem to me like good advice.  Also, a lot of it was bullshit.  So, like most things, it's complicated.  Hi, I'm T1J.  Follow me.  Hey guys, I finally got one of those fancy join buttons on my YouTube channel.  It's another great way to support me and my content, if you so desire.  That's all, just wanted to let you know that.  So, to a lot of people, self-help has become kind of a cliche and trite phrase, so you'll often see more modern terms like self-improvement or personal development.  Whatever it's called, it's a very broad genre, perhaps too broad to even be considered its own genre.  But you might know what I mean in general.  Books, videos, streams, talks, seminars, all that include purported advice on topics like finance, relationships, or health and well-being.  The common thread throughout all these topics is this notion that conventional wisdom has failed us, and by making some simple changes in your mindset and behavior, at least simple enough to fit into a single book, you can quickly transform your life.  Now, for better or for worse, I'm the type of guy that likes to see results.  It's really hard for me to learn a skill, work on a project, or develop a habit if I don't see at least incremental progress along the way.  A great example of this is, I actually own several guitars because I decided a long time ago that I was going to learn how to play, but come to find out, That shit's hard, and you kind of have to struggle through a lot of frustration and failure before you come anything close to being able to sound like you know what you're doing.  Or at least that was my experience.  So I tried on and off for years and years to get better, but just could never keep up with it.  So if anyone wants to hear me alternate between the A minor and E minor chords, I know how to do that pretty good, but that's about it.  Isn't that right, Sir Applesauce? ",
