This is the first time in ages I've seen a video that has a hole in it and a vacuum cleaner and it's suitable for kids.  So here we have in place something called the Bernoulli Principle which essentially says that a fast moving gas in this case, a fast moving fluid will create a lower pressure.  It's how planes fly and how F1 cars stick themselves to the ground.  I'm not sure how it disproves gravity though.  Yeah, and I'm still not sure how blowing wood upwards disproves gravity.  I said blowing wood.  Right, and now we finally get to it.  And it's something that John Watson could have researched in no time at all.  But essentially here, the faster moving air above that piece of wood causes a lower pressure than the air pushing up below.  So therefore, it sticks upwards and it doesn't fall.  It's not gravity disproven.  It's the Bernoulli Principle. ",
