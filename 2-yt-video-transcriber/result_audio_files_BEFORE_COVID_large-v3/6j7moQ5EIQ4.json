I hope all you did.  My daughter Caroline, who's a freshman here, was home for Christmas, so I had to switch from watching Narcos on Netflix to Hallmark movies, and that was a big change for me.  And Becky's, she always, I always let her choose the shows because she never chooses chick flicks.  She always chooses something that I enjoy with a lot of shooting and all that kind of thing.  But Caroline was home and Caroline's got a different opinion.  But we, one document, oh wait, Becky's, since then though, we've had a lot of interesting things happen Becky might want to talk about.

So when there's a room available in the hospital, she'll go in and they'll induce her.  So we'd love to have your prayers, and hopefully we'll have our second granddaughter born this afternoon.  Which, okay, I'm gonna go off script here.  So I can't believe I'm doing this, talking pause.  So we have two granddaughters right now.  Not one, we have two.  One hasn't been born yet.

It's just not American, and it's not Christian, and it's just something that we need to fight every step of the way.  If they get away with that, the next thing it'll be.  Killing a six-month-old baby because they find out it has some mental deficiency or killing an old person because there's too much trouble to look after.  So we can't go down that slippery slope.  So please fight that whenever you hear it.  Thank you, Becky.  Also, over Christmas, I watched a documentary about the 1980s.  It was on some Discovery Channel or something.  I don't know what it was.  History Channel.  And I couldn't believe all the political things that were going on that I didn't even know about.  And I started thinking, well, what was I doing in the 1980s?  And the answer is I was doing what you're doing right now.  I was going to college.  I was dating girls until I found the right one.  I was\u2014I was\u2014 You know, I was doing the same thing you guys did Wednesday night with that service that went so late.  I was studying the Gospels, the red letters, the words of Jesus Christ, and focused mainly on that.  And just, you should really do that, because it'll surprise you what Jesus said.  It's not what you've probably been told He said.  And it's something you have to read in context, and it's something you have to\u2014 When you read it, look at who he was speaking to, who his audience was, and he was not saying giving commands for everybody every time he spoke.  He was talking to certain groups, and the apostles were different than just the general population, and they had a different mission.  But just do that while you're in college.  And then I went to law school.  I was worried about what I was going to do when I got out.  I was thinking about, like I already said, who my spouse was going to be.  And so I now understand why you guys aren't so interested in politics.  When I was your age, I couldn't, I mean, I didn't have any control about, I mean, I felt like the old guys with ties and the older people with gray hair controlled everything anyway, that there was nothing I could do.  But then I started working, and I started looking at my paycheck.  and how much came out every week that I had earned.  And then I started listening to Rush Limbaugh on the radio about 1992, and I started to realize that my future depended on me taking an interest in what was happening in the country.  And I slowly you know, move towards that way of thinking.  And so, I guess what I'm saying is I get it.  I understand where you guys are.  And we, for that reason, when the leaders of CPAC came to see us this past fall and asked Liberty if Liberty would be their satellite location for the big, huge event, CPAC, conservative, what?  ...conservative political action conference.  Since 1974, the American Conservative Union and Young Americans for Freedom have had this annual convention.  Ronald Reagan gave the first keynote address, and it began to coalesce from there into the largest gathering of conservative activists and public officials.  Last year, I believe they had Colorado Christian University and Pepperdine as their satellite locations.  But they started looking at Liberty and saying, there's no place like Liberty.  And we really want to have it there.  There's so many colleges within two or three hours of here where conservative students can come to Liberty instead of... going to Washington, D.C.  and having to fight the traffic and the expense of hotel rooms and whatever the problems are with being in a big city.  And so Scott Lamb went to work on putting together a simulcast event.  It'll be seen in Washington at the same time.  it's seen here.  And Scott started putting together just a stellar line of guests.  One of them is actor Gary Sinise.  He was Lieutenant Dan Forrest Gump.  I don't know if you guys ever saw him.  He's going to talk about his book.  He's signing book plates to go into 2,500 copies that will be available that day.  But he's bringing with him his friend from the Reagan Library to explain who he is. ",

So John's in charge of the Ronald Reagan Library, and he also has the Ronald Reagan Institute in DC.  And he really wants to tell you guys about that, because he wants to pull some Liberty University students into the Ronald Reagan atmosphere.  So if you're kind of a fan of Ronald Reagan, I know you might not have been alive when he was president, but if you're a fan of Ronald Reagan, John's going to be here that day to tell you more about that.
