Some of it is on straws.  Some of it, dang, is on cheeseburgers, right?  There are a lot of different pieces to this.  And I get that people are trying to find the part that they can work on.  And what can they do?  And I'm in favor of that.  And I'm going to help.  And I'm going to support.  But understand, this is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we're all talking about.  That's what they want us to talk about.  This is your problem.  They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your light bulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers.  When 70% of the pollution of the carbon that we're throwing into the air comes from three industries and we can set our targets and say by 2028 2030 and 2035 no more think about that right there.  now the other 30 we still got to work on.  oh no we don't stop at 70 but the point is that's where we need to focus.  and why don't we focus there?  it's corruption.
