Your car may have been awesome when you first got it, but once the transmission went to shit, it's over, baby.  This went viral about a day or so ago.  I didn't know what the fuck it was, but I knew it was funny.  It's also quite odd.  It was literally pictures of grown men or videos of grown men crying while watching the Star Wars trailer.  The new one.  where J.J.  Abrams pretty much rips off a classic 1950s film.  I didn't even really see the film, but it's that famous plane scene where the guy sees a plane and he just starts fucking running.  It never made sense to me.  Then I guess, you know, it was filmed back in the day.  You know, they technically couldn't have a really great stunt pilot and stuntman try and stage getting hit by a plane's wheels.  It was too dangerous.  And it didn't have CGI.  But anyway, I don't even know what the fuck he's crying about.  If you want to cry, you need to be crying that the damn movie series is dead.  Like, you want to shed a tear.  Shed a tear for Star Wars as a whole.  It's over.  It's over.  Ackbar now. ",

I don't know how they're going to make it work, but they will because let's face it, Abrams couldn't come up with a new idea.  How does J.J.  Abrams get up in the day?  How does he brush his teeth?  Does he wait for his wife to get up and brush her teeth and then he copies what she does?  Like, really?  Let it go, Gundam.

It's literally like picking up a basketball and you're already Jordan.  So anyway, by that account, if Rey's this amazing, how come she hasn't made her own lightsaber yet?  Since she's so fucking one with the goddamn force.  And she needs no training with anything.  You know why she's using Luke's first lightsaber and Anakin's first lightsaber?  Because they want to hook you on fucking nostalgia.  Even Luke Skywalker made his own lightsaber for Return of the Goddamn Jedi.  Jesus.  And his was cooler than his father's.  I have a headache.

They had to come up with something.  so it wasn't a complete ripoff of that 1940s film, for God's sakes.  More epic?  What was epic about those last two Jedi films?  Or Star Wars films?  What was epic?  I can barely, like, I have to really focus to remember stuff about those films.  And when I do remember things, I just remember everything I hated because there's nothing I loved.  I mean, for God's sakes, Leia thrown into the vacuum of space, doesn't freeze, doesn't die, and somehow she also naturally knows how to use the Force, though never received training, then Mary Poppins her way back on the ship because that's the only way you can honestly God explain it.  I mean, even the way she flew in was very Mary Poppins-esque.  And then she remains conscious without oxygen, mind you, long enough for them to let her back in the ship and then close the door.  Then she passes out.  Oh, my fucking head, dude.  Everybody else died, though, that was inside of that thing.  Because a force apparently gives you oxygen in space.  The fucking comments.  They're goddamn vicious.  Me, my wife, and her boyfriend all watched the trailer too, and I cried all the way.  Jeez, cut this guy some slack.  So... As this guy started blowing up on the internet for pretty much crying over probably what is one of the most soulless, corporate-driven, nostalgia-fueled pieces of shit that will come out in the next year or so, a chick on Twitter, who obviously looks attractive, said, Star Wars and superhero movie obsession.  culture has revealed a whole new population of undateable men might be worse than men that wear cargo shorts.  Probably undateable by her standards, but Eric Butz, actually appears to have a girlfriend.  And they seem to be very much happy and in love.  Surprisingly.  So there's proof that there's someone for everyone.  Even good old Eric Butts.  He did do one more reaction trailer for the new Star Wars Fallen Order.  Can I get through this?  No, I can't do this.  I can't sit and watch this guy watch Star Wars.  I can't.  Like, the excitement for this shit that this guy has.  Like, you look at games now.  Like, even though the new Star Wars game that's coming out by Respawn looks promising in the sense of it won't have all the usual bullshit in it.  It's still just a Star Wars game in the modern era.  You know it's going to follow certain tropes.  It probably won't be that interesting.  I mean, I don't get my hopes up for anything anymore.  I've been disappointed far too many times to get my hopes up.  I'm too old.  You know, I'm old enough to know the world doesn't always turn out the way you'd like.  The girl you put all your energy and effort in will probably one day leave you for some piece of shit.  You can work hard every day to try and achieve your goals and you won't get nowhere near as someone else who puts in not even a one-tenth of the effort you do.  It's just life.  And some of us are meant to suffer in a world full of bullshit.  And everybody else can sit back and pretend it's fine, but not me, man.  The government's out to fuck you.  For God's sakes, Activision doesn't pay taxes.  They have tax havens, and people are acting shocked.  Activision has a tax haven and a basement?  For me, I'm like, what a surprise.  Everybody's like, what?  It's like, how are you surprised?  Amazon didn't pay taxes at all last year, and they made $11 billion.  Let's get me out of here.  I'm going to die. ",
