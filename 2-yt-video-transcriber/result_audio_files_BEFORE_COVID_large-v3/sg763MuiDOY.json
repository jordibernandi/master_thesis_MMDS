            "text": "Hey folks.  So I'm sitting here in a restaurant in New York City, and I thought there's no better place than to tell a joke that explains the nature of Trotskyism.  The joke goes like this.  So, there's a very fancy restaurant.  There's a man in the restaurant who's very well-dressed.  He's clearly very happy, having a great time.  There's a woman in the restaurant.  She walks over to him and says, I don't know you, sir, but you seem like an interesting guy.  Why are you celebrating here in this fancy restaurant in New York City?  The guy says, well, he says, I'm a writer, and I've just had a book published, and I am just so excited about my new book, which has been published.  She says, oh, is it fiction or nonfiction?  He says, oh, it's nonfiction.  It's a nonfiction book, and it's about Marxism and socialism.  The woman says, wow.  She says, you're a Marxist?  Are you like China?  Are you like Venezuela?  Are you like Cuba or like North Korea?  And the man looks at her and says, no, no, no, no.  I'm a Trotskyist.  I am so much more revolutionary than China, so much more revolutionary than Cuba, so much more revolutionary than Venezuela, North Korea, any of those countries.  I am far more radical.  than any of those countries you just listed.  See, I'm a Trotskyist.  I believe in permanent revolution.  My ideas are so radical.  And this new book I have just published, it lays out a view of Marxism that is so exciting and so radical.  That's why I'm celebrating it being published, because I am just thrilled.  And the woman says, wow, okay.  She says, I mean, are you worried that, I mean, I'm almost surprised that a book that radical, you know, has been published here in the United States, that a book like that would get published.  And he says, oh, you wouldn't believe it.  He said, my book is so radical that the CIA has agreed to publish it. ",
