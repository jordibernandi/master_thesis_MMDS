            "text": "What's going on America?  This is Kevin from Kevin's Corner.  Have you ever seen somebody who?  They should just keep their mouth quiet.  You know, nobody's paying attention to them, but for whatever reason, they want to be known and they know that they got some dirt on them.  You know, if you are a pack of gazelles and you see one gazelle over there drinking water, he's not paying attention.  The lion's about to go get him.  That's not the time for you to make noise so that the lion will say, well, you know, I was going to eat this gazelle, but now you just brought my attention straight to you.  And you about to bring this on yourself.  You could have just tiptoed right on out and kept your mouth quiet.  But you want to make noise, right?  That's the same thing happening with Ilhan Omar.  So now I watch the Tucker show tonight.  Tucker just did a piece on the whole thing about Ilhan Omar being fraudulent and gaming the immigration system to get into America and also marrying her brother as well and then playing around with some taxes.  Now they've been digging in this.  up in Minnesota where she's from.  I think it's Minnesota.  They've been digging in this, but it's a local thing.  It was contained.  It was quiet.  Everybody runs up to her, ask her a question.  She keeps walking like she don't know that they're, but then when they want her to get up and spew garbage about Trump or people on the right, they give her a platform.  She's, you know, she's just vocal.  She's like a parrot, you know, just can't stop talking.  Democrats, the Republicans are racist.  I mean, just a whole bunch of stuff.  She's just talking constantly.  then when you stick a mic in her face and ask her something about her family that's personal.  you can't ask me those questions but you want to go digging in trump's taxes you want to go digging in his business affairs all of that stuff.  but then when somebody asks you about your family in the background mom's the word just keep walking put your head down and say that's none of your business.  so now what she has done is created an enemy.  now what do i mean?  the president regardless of how you feel, is going to get attention.  Whatever he says, it's going to bring the media to that particular statement.  whether it comes from the right, whether it comes from the left, whatever statement he makes, the liberal media is gonna dive into it, so is the conservative media.  But the difference is, the liberal media concerning him bringing up this topic when he was about to get on Marine One, they are activists in trying to cover it up.  They're not interested.  Isn't it amazing how they're supposed to be journalists and wanna get to the truth?  But then all Ilhan Omar has to do is just say, well, if you're looking into this, it's not because you want to know and you're a good journalist.  It's because you're racist, sexist, misogynist and anti-Muslim.  And, you know, I guess that just settles it.  Everybody says, well, I guess we can't go any further.  You know, so.  What's happening is the left, after Trump's made that comment, the left, well, you know what, I can't believe he would even bring this up.  She's already denied it.  Oh, okay, so any good journalist would say, okay, well, let's keep digging.  Trump denied Russia collusion or conspiracy, but nobody just said, well, if that settles it, then let's just get on out of here, wrap it up, get the cameras out of here.  No, no.  They said, no, we're going to go and get to the truth.  They went deep sea diving.  They was like Jack Cousteau.  You know, this is Jack Cousteau.  I am trying to find the wily and elusive Russia collusion.  That's what they were doing.  They were down there trying to find some garbage and get to the bottom of it.  They were even in trash cans, in dumpsters.  CNN was in the dumpster, which where they belong, that's where they really belong.  But now all of a sudden, Trump makes this claim, which has some validity to it, which has some real substance and some crumbs to follow the evidence, unlike the Russia collusion thing.  But nobody, nobody on the left wants to investigate this.  Yeah.  So what she has done now is brought herself into the limelight because she couldn't keep her mouth shut.  She could have got to Congress laid low, you know, kind of.  fill fill out everything like.  couldn't you see how these things work?  keep my mouth quiet.  but no you jump in there and want to be a full-blown activist disruptor and bring all this necessary unnecessary attention to yourself.  she could have just been quiet.  now somebody's gonna go deep deep diving in her business.  that's what's gonna happen and i guarantee you what they come up with.  it's not gonna be a good situation.  a lot of seaweed under there.  so She has created an enemy.  Trump throws it out there.  Now it has national attention on it.  Then Tucker picks up the story.  And now people who maybe weren't even looking at that, they were just looking at her as a big mouth, anti-American, non-patriotic, over activist politician.  Now people are saying, well, you know what?  I want to get to the bottom of this.  Because you brought unnecessary attention on yourself.  I was going after Nancy Pelosi.  You know, everybody was going after AOC, but then Ilhan Omar was like, but what about me?  Now, right before the lion eats them, he stops and says.  Now, see, I wasn't even thinking about you.  But you just created a problem for yourself.  You made an unnecessary enemy.  Now I got to eat you.  See, so that's what's about to happen to her.  I got a feeling once that all unravels, she's going to have a lot of answers, questions to answer.  And I'm wondering how she's going to answer them.  Oh, I know.  Racism, sexism, misogyny, anti-Muslim.  It's the only reason you found this stuff.  And it's true.  It's true.  But nonetheless, let's see if I can get you with this.  Racism.  sexism, misogyny, hit you with the Jedi mind trick, get you off my back, anyway, God bless you, yeah, unnecessary enemy, man, it's the worst enemy to make, the president, because you know he ain't gonna let it go, when he gets on it, he's gonna be like a dog on the bone, get it off me, nah, nah, he's gonna stay right there on the bone, anyway, check me out.  every Wednesday night, 7 30 live in Kevin's Corner on youtube and also on my radio blog talk show.  don't forget to hit like share subscribe and notification button and find me on the twitter.  check out extreme tease my sponsor.  the link is in the bottom of this video.  uh if you click on it up until sunday you'll get free shipping and if you type my name in the promo code kevin you'll get something 20 off of it.  if you want to donate to kevin and kevin's corner feel free.  click on uh the link below and Do what you do.  I appreciate it.  And also, I put a question out there about me switching to Patreon or having a backup channel.  If you didn't see my last video, I'm toying around with going to Patreon.  I don't know much about it, but one of my subscribers suggested it because they want me to deal with some more controversial topics that I know.  YouTube is not going to let that happen.  So before I jump ship, not saying that I won't make videos on YouTube, but I also don't want to be held captive to YouTube one day.  You know, I make a controversial video and then let's get him out of here, snatch some stuff.  So let me know if that's something you would be interested in supporting before I pack up and.  move over there.  uh so you can leave your comments in the bottom.  all right god bless see you next time in kevin's corner.  and if i was ilhan omar i might be looking to try to get some asylum in some other country right now because right now everybody going yeah they're sniffing around.  god bless see you next time kevin's corner.
