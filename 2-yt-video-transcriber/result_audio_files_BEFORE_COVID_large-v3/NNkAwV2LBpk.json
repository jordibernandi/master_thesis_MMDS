            "text": "On August 1, 2019, an Oklahoma Court of Appeal dismissed Daniel Holtzclaw's appeal from conviction.  Daniel was a police officer in Oklahoma City who was framed by his own department.  Investigators fabricated a victim profile, then sought out accusers by using his own police records of people that Daniel had run free record checks.  than employing the media to help those accusers identify him as their alleged attacker the forensic expert who testified turned out to be the mother-in-law of one of the lead investigators.  this was never disclosed to defence.  Elaine Taylor misrepresented DNA evidence at trial and failed to conduct a proper set of forensic tests.  after her son-in-law handled evidence without gloves on and put both Daniel's belt and pants into the same paper bag for forensic testing.  Daniel was convicted of half the charges and sentenced to 263 years in prison, a verdict which has been best described as splitting the baby by a jury who couldn't agree on guilt or innocence.  During his trial, a protest mob took photos of the jury members, could be heard by the jury chanting, racist cop, racist jury, while testimony was being given, and in one incident were caught approaching a person they thought was on the jury in order to intimidate them.  In a decision riddled with vitriol from judges who were supposed to be neutral, the appeal court begins with the completely inane statement, quote, in his defense, Appellant basically asked jurors to accept as true all the information that victims gave about the stops.  that was amply supported by police records and documents, but to determine that the same victims were lying about the details of the sexual assaults.  Basically, huh?  The entire point is that the investigators reverse-engineered their case by starting with the records of who they knew he had stopped.  They only approached women.  they had profiled themselves, out of all the people Daniel could be proven to have stopped during his shift.  Of course he's not denying that he stopped them.  The judges make it sound like he was forced to admit it, as if saying, people of the jury, I've never seen this woman before in my life, is the normal defense tactic of an innocent person.  In reality, most accusations take place between people who agree that they met, but dispute what happened.  This shocking stupidity from allegedly learned judges takes place before they even start addressing Daniel's grounds of appeal.  That one sentence that I quoted is the best the courts could do to summarize Daniel's entire defense.  Never mind the part about how none of his accusers could actually pick him out of a photo lineup or even describe him accurately until the police gave the media his name and photograph.  One described him as a short black man, while Daniel is a 6'2 bodybuilder, half-Japanese man who appears mostly Caucasian.  Let's put it this way.  He's fairly easy to remember.  But no, the learned appeal court judges didn't think stuff like that was worthy of mention.  In case you're dubious about bias, Judge Lewis added his own special note, writing, quote, This case involves a sexual predator who happened to be employed, most unfortunately, as an Oklahoma City police  officer.\".  Lewis goes on to declare that Daniel had 13 separate victims, completely ignoring that he was not convicted of crimes against all the complainants.  This is a serious error that completely exposes the judge as biased.  In Lewis's mind, he finds Daniel guilty of things for which he was acquitted.  Given that Lewis declares all 13 women to be victims, when he says, quote, Moreover, appellant was acquitted on half the charges, showing the jury was not influenced unfairly by the trial of multiple counts, end quote, well, he's undone his own argument.  Lewis himself thinks Daniel was guilty of all charges, so as a result, he thinks the jury unbiased.  Of course, compared to Judge Lewis, the jury was significantly less biased, but that doesn't mean that the trial was fair.  Daniel and his family were prepared for this decision because it's well known that Oklahoma Court of Appeals is a cesspool.  The reality is that appeals are not about facts.  They're about words, and the system is designed to uphold convictions.  This particular court made this very clear by refusing amicus briefs from the top DNA experts in the USA and two lawyers who sought to bring new case law to their attention regarding the circus atmosphere created by the protesters and the media, which obviously did affect the jury.  They also allowed secret hearings to take place in which Daniel Holzclaw's own lawyers were not permitted to attend.  Daniel's appeal never had a chance, and beyond that, they took two years to deliver their predetermined decision, and now Daniel will have to continue waiting in prison to file the next step in his quest for exoneration.  One of the things that strikes me about the growing number of cases of wrongful convictions that are successfully overturned is how many years these innocent people spend in prison because the system is so slow.  You would think the government would do something about that.  The average case of wrongful conviction takes about 15 years to correct.  That is 15 years an innocent person spends incarcerated before the facts come to light.  What they want is for people to give up.  And that's the one thing that Daniel and Daniel's family and friends won't do, no matter how long it takes.  I'm Diana Davison, an advocate for the falsely accused and wrongfully convicted.
