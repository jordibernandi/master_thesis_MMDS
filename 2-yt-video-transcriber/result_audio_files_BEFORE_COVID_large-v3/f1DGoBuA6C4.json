            "text": "To be a great man, to be a self-creator, a self-master, what I referred to in my last book as a noble beast, you need to stop thinking about recreation and start thinking about recreation.  You know, a great man's recreational preferences are the least interesting thing about him.  What kind of wine did Caesar drink?  Nobody cares.  You know, it's trivia.  A tiny, forgettable detail set against the grand story of his life.  The master creates.  He is known by his works, not his pastimes, not his likes.  His life is not suffering.  The noble beast is glad to be alive.  He's glad to be able to exert his strength and his will and intellect.  He is pleased.  To be able to continue to create again and again.  The noble beast doesn't want to relax.  He just wants to keep becoming.  To keep making himself anew.  And I started thinking about this, you know, talking to a young guy who has mentoring.

When a man forces himself to work, He works to realize a vision.  But during the process, more visions reveal themselves to him.  So he finds himself not working toward an end of work, but toward the next beginning, to get to what's next.  I can't wait to get to the projects, get done with this conference, and get to this party I have to host in a couple weeks, and then I get to plan the next thing that I'm working on in my life.  And that's what I'm really excited about.  So don't struggle to get to the end so that you can relax.  That's for slaves.  Struggle to get to the next struggle.  Because as a self-creator, your great work... ",
