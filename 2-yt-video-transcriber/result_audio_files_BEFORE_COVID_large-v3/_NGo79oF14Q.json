            "text": "Hey everyone, I'm Diana Davison, advocate for the falsely accused and wrongfully convicted.  Now, it's been a long time since I've uploaded my last video and part of the reason for that is that I was busy moving to Toronto.  I'm setting up a satellite for the Lighthouse Project.  That's my non-profit in which I advocate for and attend court with the falsely accused.  And a lot of the so-called belly of the beast is going on in Toronto.  I'm now here full time and but also still traveling to other places.  I'm helping people all across Canada and in the United States and I answer calls from other countries as well.  So if you're interested in that, I'll put a link to Lit House Project below.  And I'm going to be back on YouTube again every week starting now.  So I'm glad to be back.  One of the things that I've been doing recently aside from writing for the Post Millennial and I'll put a link to that below as well because for any of you who are wondering what I'm doing in between videos so you can keep track of my projects and the things that I'm saying on the Post Millennial.  One of the things I'm doing is watching the Supreme Court of Canada.  I am located in Canada and thus very interested and more capable of taking action to try to address some of the changes that are taking place in our courtrooms in Canada.  So there are three cases that have been pending in front of the Supreme Court.  I've been watching these.  One of them was just released two days ago and the media has reported on it, but there's a lot of nuance to this case.  that is not being addressed on the immediate responses.  And I think it's very important, especially because the individual involved is going back to retrial now on this case, But there are three cases before the Supreme Court in Canada.  R v. Barton decision just released this last week on Friday, and another one called Goldfinch, and another one R v. RV.  The names are all anonymous to protect the complainant.  But the Barton decision was just released.  Now, this was actually not precisely a sexual assault case.  This was a case of alleged murder, first degree murder he was charged with, and manslaughter as an included offense.  So the Supreme Court has sent this case, Arvers v. Barton, they sent Bradley Barton back to retrial on the manslaughter charge only.  And one of the interesting factors with this case in terms of sexual assault trials is that the alleged manslaughter was the result of what would have been a sexual assault.  So he was accused of, the theory from the prosecutors was that he used some sort of a weapon during a sexual encounter with his victim.  Her name's Cindy Gledow.  And she was an indigenous woman who was also a prostitute.  So this is an aspect of the case which I think is really important to address that I have not seen the mainstream media talking about thus far, but I think should play into the upcoming retrial of Mr.  Barton.  So Cindy Gladow was, um, acting as a prostitute.  She was, that was her career, whether she had chosen it or not.  There's no nothing in the media alleging that she was forced into prostitution.  And it was part of his defense that he had previously purchased services from Ms.  Gledow the night before she unfortunately passed away.  And that on the night of the incident, she accepted the same amount of money for the same act that took place the night prior.  Now this act, and this is where we get into some of these unsavory aspects, was that Mr.  Bradley engaged in the act of fisting, although it wasn't a full-fledged fisting event.  It was an attempt at such to a point where he alleges, unfortunately, Ms.  Gledow is not here to give her version of the events anymore, but that he was, you know, thought that she was enjoying what they were doing and the previous night he'd attempted this fisting, although not completed it, and then had a sexual act with her and then said, hey, I'll give you, and it's really kind of disgraceful, 60 bucks for the same thing.  And so he did the same thing, although he admits a little more vigorously.  But before they had the sexual encounter, he noticed she was bleeding and he's like, oh, gross.  And he went and cleaned himself up, told her to have a shower, fell asleep and woke up in the morning.  She was dead in the bathtub.  So that's the facts of the case, um, that are somewhat agreed upon.  And then the crown had this theory that he had used some sort of an implement on her because bizarrely there was a, an 11 inch or centimeter.  I don't know if it's like there was a big gash in her uterus.  And so they figured he must've used some sort of a weapon to do that, like a knife or something, but they never found any implement.  And he says it never happened.  He only did the same thing.  Now, okay, so here's where I think in the retrial, and for my American audience, yes, I always have to say this.  In Canada, Mr.  Burton was acquitted of all crimes, including the manslaughter charge, and then his acquittal was appealed successfully.  They went to the Supreme Court.  Supreme Court partially agreed with the appeal courts.  They sent it back to retrial on manslaughter only, but they upheld the the murder charge acquittal.  so in Canada yes you can actually be acquitted and then retry it again.  and this is one of the big problems with these decisions coming out.  because one of the issues in this and the other two cases that are coming up in the Supreme Court Goldfinch and RV the Crown the prosecutor because it's you know Regina in Canada.  so the prosecutor has elicited or has led evidence of previous sexual activity.  Sometimes they'll say, oh, well, she was a virgin if it suits them, or they'll say they're married with children, which implies they've had sex before if it suits them.  And these are all obviously inferences of past sexual activity.  But if the defense wants to bring it up, even in terms of in gold French, whether or not they had an ongoing casual sexual relationship, Apparently, if they get acquitted, that was all passe, never been allowed.  So then what they're dealing with in Supreme Court is, can the prosecutor adduce evidence that would otherwise be barred if the defense was to bring it into trial?  And it's kind of like, can you have your cake and eat it too?  And one of the problems I see with the current decision in the Bradley case is that they have said, this case which was murder so it wasn't on the surface something where they would have thought you had to engage with these special rules of evidence for sexual assault cases that the the judge should have known because they started talking about past sexual activity.  he should have stopped the proceedings and said we need to have an application whether it was the prosecutor who was introducing that evidence or whether it was the defense.  so But it's not one of the named offenses in which his charge wasn't one of the ones that was listed under these so-called rape shield laws.  So it's not precisely an error of the judge.  It's sort of like a, hey, new rule, right?  If the thing you're charged with includes an element of sexual conduct, then the judge is supposed to flag this.  But he didn't precisely.  And I think we need to have a public body who can defend judges who are disparaged in these decisions.  Because this is a new thing that's being talked about.  In fact, it only came up in appeal.  It didn't come up in the trial itself.  And that's part of the issue.  Can errors, including the prosecutors not identifying and trying to flag errors at the time, can the accused then be made to suffer a retrial?  because after acquittal, through no fault of their own they decided that they want to create or expand the laws?  and it's just not right.  because you know Barton I think is getting legal aid now his lawyers are either working pro bono or they're covered because he's incarcerated or I don't actually know if he is right now or not because he was acquitted.  but anyways should the accused person suffer the financial consequences of errors of the court that were through no fault of that person's own.  And I think in cases where somebody is acquitted, that any further legal expense incurred upon them by any, you know, experimentation in our courts should not be at the expense of the accused person.  They've already defended themselves successfully once.  if you want to retry them and we're going to make room for that, as we've done in Canada for decades, then it has to be at the expense of the crown of the prosecutors, because that is one of the few deterrents.  And I would say that in Canada, I've noticed Alberta as a province is the most egregious for overturning acquittals and there's no deterrent for them doing that.  And in fact, not only is there no deterrent, they are successfully employing the media in order to not only help them get the appeal courts, and I do think the judges are influenced by this because they've specifically addressed public pressure in some of their verdicts, but that these prosecutors are employing the media to not only get the acquittals overturned, but to make sure they'll get a conviction on the retrial.  And that is not okay.  There has to be something to make them pay and to deter them from frivolously appealing these things.  And I will say also that I've seen, especially in Alberta, that they are more willing to overturn acquittals by overriding the judge's assessment of credibility and less willing to do so.  They use a different standard when they're upholding a conviction.  So all these things, they all need to be looked at.  And that's one of the things that I'm doing.  And unfortunately, in the past, we our media has been, we had court reporters who understand the courts, and they actually verify what they're saying about court decisions before they inform the public that there's some injustice or something before they weigh in with their opinions.  But now the media is under a lot of pressure competing with the internet and bloggers, people like me, although, you know, I'm just apparently, you know, I just write op-eds for Post Millennial, but I'm now also getting published.  But many of the people who are raising the hysteria about our court decisions are not informed on the law.  And there's no public body defending the judges against this.  Judges in Canada cannot speak out publicly about their decisions to defend themselves.  There's a really interesting history behind that.  So if they can't do that, and they're going to be disparaged in some cases, like Judge Robin Camp removed from the bench because of public hysteria, even though what they said was taken out of context, misrepresented, that they can be attacked publicly and nobody's defending them.  So I think that we need to actually have a public body, a representative, a spokesperson for members of the judiciary to protect the public faith in the judiciary, to make sure.  And I'm not saying that they shouldn't be criticized because It's very, we have open courts so that judges can be criticized and held to account for what they're doing and so that we can see, the public can see justice being done.  But at the same time, we need to make sure that the public is being properly informed of what happened.  And that can't happen when the people reporting on it don't understand legal language.  They can't actually interpret what was said and explain it properly to the public.  So the public shouldn't be getting outraged over verdicts unless they are properly being told what happened in court and why.  And there, as we know, there's always two sides to a story, but it's just too easy, especially now with social media and Twitter, for journalists to go publish something that's really inflammatory and then go and rally up a big protest mob, which, you know, turn into vigilante mobs, throwing eggs at courthouses and doing all kinds of public mischief at the behest of journalists.  And for some reason, this isn't considered to be a misuse of your voice.  And, you know, I'm not a big... I don't support the use of hate speech and things like that.  But I do think that the protection of journalism is a protection... to keep the public informed and misinforming the public is not something to be protected.  It needs to be addressed and it needs to be addressed properly.  So I am going to go through this decision in the Barton case.  And one of the things I want to leave you with, because this video is getting quite long.  One of the things I want to leave you with is this idea about.  there's a competing narrative and both are very strong voices.  The competing narrative about whether or not prostitutes like Ms.  Gladue can consent to sex.  There's a feminist narrative that's sort of, I guess you would say, based in Catherine MacKinnon's way of thinking that women can never consent to sex at all, and especially if they're prostitutes.  She was very anti-prostitution.  So there's this idea that Ms.  Gladow could not have consented to any sexual activity, especially something that's potentially dangerous like fisting.  And then there's another narrative, and I'll put a link to an article below from a sex worker talking about how prostitutes are actually in a position to educate people, like they know more about consent than anybody else.  And I think that it's not a good policy to assume that people who engage in sex work, women, especially women who engage in sex work, because there's men who do as well, but for some reason we're overly focused just on the women as we are in any other claims that women are always victims, Sex workers actively negotiate consent.  And this is the argument made in this article that I'm going to link to, that sex workers know more about consent than the average person.  They have to exercise their consent on a regular basis.  And so the Supreme Court, I think, in this decision has taken a perspective that as not just a sex worker, but compiling on intersectional issues of Ms.  Gladow being an aboriginal, person, indigenous person, they keep changing language when we're supposed to say that, um, you know, and, and there was a, uh, an abuse of language in terms of her not being referred to by her name, but by her race in, in this trial.  And that's unfortunate.  haven't read the transcripts and I'm going to wager that the prosecutor probably referred to her as an indigenous woman more often than by her name as well because that was to their advantage.  that's part of their strategy and and I think that's an important issue too I mean there's so much I get into because I haven't been doing videos for so long and there's a lot of stuff I haven't said yet but this is a fascinating case that I is going to go back to retrial.  And I think going into retrial, the advantage, of course, and one of the reasons why this should never happen, is that the prosecutors can now adjust their theory.  And this is one of the arguments made in front of the Supreme Court, is that, in fact, the prosecutors were changing their theory of how Ms.  Gledow came to her death on appeal, which is one of the few circumstances in Canada where it's deemed to be a double jeopardy situation.  You can't try Mr.  Barton saying he killed her with a knife and then say, oh no, our new theory now that he got acquitted is that he killed her another way.  And that's going to happen in this retrial.  Absolutely going to happen and it shouldn't be allowed.  Even if you accept that a retrial after acquittal can be allowed, changing your theory should not be allowed.  but his defense is going to have to address some of the things.  I've done a video in the past saying judges need to watch more porn.  And one of the issues here in terms of intent and whether or not this was a dangerous act they can consent to, they have to take into account the fact that there is a lot of porn more extreme than the act of fisting out there.  And so people engage in these activities not thinking that it's a dangerous thing and the person receiving it has to communicate in some way.  And, you know, and of course, one of the disadvantages for Ms.  Gladow in this trial is that she's not present to give her side of the story.  And I have a lot of sympathy for that.  And it's a very difficult situation.  But I'm going to probably, you know, because I'm ending the video now, I'm going to have to do another video on this.  But there are two other cases coming up in the Supreme Court that I want to report on.  And the basic update is that I'm now in Toronto.  where I'm working with a bunch of lawyers, criminal lawyers, civil defamation court issues, because everyone who's falsely accused wants to sue someone at some point.  So I can tell you that I'm learning a lot more about that.  It's a very difficult decision to make.  And I'm just really happy to be back on camera again and say hi to everybody.  Thanks for being so patient with me.  And please donate to the Lighthouse to support the work that I'm doing. ",
