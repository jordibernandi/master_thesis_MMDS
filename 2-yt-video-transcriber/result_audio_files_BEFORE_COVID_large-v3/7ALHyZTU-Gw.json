            "text": "Well, it has finally happened and I'm very happy to come on this brief YouTube video to announce to those of you who have kept up with our ministry over the years that the Old Testament and commentary is now in our warehouse and ready for distribution and ready for you to get your copy if you would like one.  Let me just share with you about this.  Most of you know if you keep up with our ministry that I spent about seven years doing a commentary on the entire Bible.  And the Old Testament was the longest actually.  It took about four years just with the Old Testament.  And there's only two articles here that I let other people write.  Everything else is a personal commentary from tens of thousands of notes.  From over, at that time, it would have been probably around 170,000 hours of Bible study.  And when I say Bible study, that doesn't just mean reading the Bible.  That's reading books.  That's reading scholarly articles.  That's reading magazine articles.  So we glean from just many years of research.  But I've got to tell you about this.  This is the chestnut edition that's made available to anyone who would purchase it.  And look how thick this is.  This is very heavy.  Tammy and Robbie go with me on the road and she said, you know, the other day, Perry, after one of the big meetings, my wrist was hurting.  And she said, I kept saying to myself, what did I do?  And she remembered she was handed these Bibles and you can feel it right in here, you know, when you pick it up.  Anyway, it's two color.  It is the same interior color as our New Testament.  It's the teal green and black.  And I have had, in fact, Tammy's mother is 80 years of age, and her background is Southern Baptist, and she has one of these.  And she told Tammy the other day, she said, reading the book of Genesis, just reading through it and reading the notes, I learned more than I learned in all the years of sitting in church in Sunday school.  And that's what we wanted to design this for.  And so, and I'm going to just look here.  Look at Genesis.  The table of the nations.  How the future is encoded in the past.  That is wild.  That's a sermon message just all by itself.  Now again, it has nugget boxes.  I'm reading the nugget boxes.  How the flood affected early human lifespan.  We get all the years from Shem all the way down to Abraham.  The ten generations of the ten most important men.  The amazing 1948 years or 1,948 years.  I mean, this is a lot.  A picture of a progression into bondage.  Now, this is the nugget boxes.  The commentary is at the bottom.  Every page.  Look, commentary, commentary, commentary, commentary, commentary.  Why was and is circumcision so important?  When God changed the name of Abram to Abraham, he changed the name of Sarai to Sarai by adding the letter He, which is found in the sacred name of God twice.  Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.  Long story there.  You'd have to get all the details there.  The parallels between Abraham and Isaac's story and Christ's death on the cross.  The barren matriarchs.  Now, in just the back of Genesis, I've got to tell you about this because these are like reading books.  There's something at the end of every Old Testament book called in-depth.  Now, the in-depth, what it does, it goes in-depth.  Now, this is page after page after page of a fascinating subject.  This, okay, well, this is just one half page here.  The gap theory in the creation of hell from Genesis 1.  1 through 2.  That's at the end of the book of Genesis.  Then watch this.  Jerusalem and the parallels to the Garden of Eden.  I show you why Jerusalem has a link to the ancient Garden of Eden.  Look at the pages.  Look at what you're getting here.  Look.  This is a book.  This is a book.  The Hill of the Skull.  Seven times Christ shed his blood.  The mystery of... Now, here's the... This is the one part of this Bible that even a scholar, who's a Greek scholar, who's a friend of mine, he has a PhD, was a teacher at the university.  He said, Perry, you might want to leave that out because there is a controversy over fallen angels taking on themselves the form of flesh and creating the giants.  Well, the Bible says that.  But we go into all of the quotes.  Look at this.  This is just on the mystery of giants and the origin of evil spirits from the book of Genesis.  Look at this.  Look at this.  A lesson from observant Jews on how to treat God's word.  How to treat the scripture.  How they copy the scripture.  How do you care for the scripture.  Okay.  This is the book of Genesis.  King James translation with the commentary.  It goes through the entire Bible.  The two silver trumpets of Exodus.  I'm flipping through here.  The temple according to the Jewish historian Josephus.  I quote him.  You don't have to go grab the whole book.  I quote Josephus through the whole Old Testament.  The sacred compartments in the house of God.  2 Chronicles in depth.  Dancing with broken bones from Psalms.  Psalms 51a.  Look at there.  It's a whole commentary on one verse.  So I want to tell you something.  It's printed in America, not in China or India.  It's got beautiful stitching, hand-stitched here.  Great chestnut imitation leather cover.  You've got to remember, you're getting 35 solid years of research of 170,000 hours of study in one book.  Now, it should be a lot more than what we're asking for, and I'm being very serious with you.  In fact, when I announced what we were selling it for, people could not believe it.  But we're selling this entire book to help our ministry.  We have seven big outreaches, and we've got to raise funds to do some stuff.  $150 for the entire Bible.  But because postage is so heavy with this, I mean, it cost us $37,000 just for the shipping.  But to send it out, it's so heavy that we have to include a $10 postage charge.  So it's a total of $160.  But you can call our office.  And let me say this.  This is not available in any bookstore.  This is not available on Amazon.  You can only... Get this Bible through the ministry.  Now, the partner's edition.  for you, the partners, you have a genuine leather edition, which is it costs more because the leather cover was very expensive.  So partners, most of you know that.  But if you want to get this, you have to contact our office.  Now, what we'll do, it'll be on the website and we'll give you a number on the screen that you can call it Voice of Evangelism.  And again, it's $150 plus $10 postage or $160.  And it comes in this beautiful box.  And by the way, the box wasn't free.  This is not an expensive box, but it costs money.  And your Bible will come shipped like this.  You put it in a box to make sure nothing gets bent.  And there you have it.  So it's now available.  And I've been telling you about this for 10 years.  Now, the other thing I have to make you aware of is that the Partners Bible, we only did 7,500 copies and we only have a little under 5,000 left.  and we've just started advertising to Partners.  This Bible.  The New Testament, we did 75,000 copies, but this cost so much to do and to ship, I had to reduce the numbers drastically.  So there's only 38,000 of these left as of right now.  Now, by the time, you know, two or three weeks from now, it's going to be a lot less.  But we're going to advertise it on Manifest, put it in the magazine.  And just 39,000, trust me, they could go before the year is out.  And I don't have any intention of going back to a publisher and printing another 25 or 30,000 of these.  So you need to get one while you can.  All right?  And so I want to let you know that the Bible is now available and ready.  And I hope.  that many of you will take the opportunity to invest in yourself and in your spiritual walk and in your wisdom and knowledge and understanding of the Word of God.  We did the work for you.  Now all you have to do is get a copy and then just enjoy studying the Bible.  Thank you.  God bless you. ",
