            "text": "It's our character that will guide us through the choppy waters that we find ourselves in right now.  Over the past few weeks, several media articles have taken issue with our TurboTax business.  They've questioned our decisions, drawn long conclusions about our intent, and challenged the integrity of our company and the very essence of what we stand for.  In one case, an elected official read these articles and called for an investigation into the practices of Intuit, H&R Block, and others in the industry.  More specifically, practices related to search.  I want you to know that I take these challenges personally, and I know you do too.  And I want you to hear our story directly from me.  I'm going to explain our search practices in detail and address the broader accusations about deceptive business practices, so please bear with me.  We are and will always be a values-driven company.  And chief among those values is integrity without compromise.  We are always assessing our decisions and actions through this lens.  And the bar is high.  That will never change.  If we ever do something that crosses the line or even appears to cross the line, we will look into find a better way.  Now, with that said, let me get into the important context about the environment in which these accusations are being made.  At the center of it all is a single publication that has written 22 stories challenging our company over the last five years.  Each of these articles have been written and published in the context of a specific wider political agenda.  That agenda is to create a centralized government system of pre-filled tax returns.  They claim it is better to have the tax collector centralized.  all aspects of the taxation process from collecting accurate data about taxpayers, to filling out the original return, to determining if a person deserves a refund, to auditing the return, to enforcing compliance.  In their efforts to advance this agenda, this primary tactic is to challenge and discredit the leader in the tax prep industry, and that would be us.  I'm proud of our leadership position.  This amazing franchise has a positive impact on millions of lives across North America.  In the US, millions of Americans wake up every day searching to build a prosperous life.  But the reality is that they struggle to make ends meet and can't even think about setting money aside for the future.  The tax time is a moment in time when they can start to change that trajectory of their financial life.  Often, it's the time when they receive the biggest check of the year.  But some lack confidence in their ability to file their own taxes accurately and get the largest refund that they deserve.  That's why we created TurboTax.  Each year, we help taxpayers put approximately $68 billion in tax refunds back into their pockets.  And importantly, our customers make the choice to pay us for those benefits that we deliver, like audit defense, just to name one.  At the same time, we offer solutions that are free of charge through both our TurboTax free product and the free product we offer through the IRS free file program.  Over the past five years, tens of millions of consumers filed their taxes for free using one of our free offerings.  That is more than every tax prep company combined.  Let me say that one more time.  tens of millions of consumers filed their taxes for free using one of our free offerings.  That is more than every other tax prep company combined.  It's these services, along with the IRS Free File Program in general, that are at the heart of the current media scrutiny.  So let me talk about each for a moment.  Overall, the IRS Free File Program has delivered more than 55 million free file tax returns and e-filing, and has saved taxpayers more than a billion and a half dollars.  The name of the Intuit product that we offer as part of this program is called the TurboTax Free File Program.  By design, the name closely mirrors the name of the IRS Free File Program.  It's a great product with features and functionality that's on par with our own commercial product.  Last year, 1.2 million returns were filed using the free file product, which was 43% of all the filings returned under the program, more than all other 11 companies that participate in the program.  At the same time, TurboTax offers its own free product.  We named that product TurboTax Free Edition.  As I said a moment ago, tens of millions of taxpayers have used this product over the last five years to file their taxes for no cost.  This product has additional benefits like expert assistance that are not allowed in the product we offer through the IRS free file program.  The eligibility for these two Intuit products is very different.  The difference is, along with the fact that the names of our two products are similar, is at the heart of the untrue allegations about our search practices.  So let me unpack the search practices.  For this past year, we created a holistic marketing approach, including widely used search techniques to differentiate between our own free products and the one we offer through the Free File program.  Knowledge is power, and we wanted to equip taxpayers with the information they need to make an informed choice and more easily find the product they were looking for.  As you know, we advertise a lot.  We've all seen them, free, free, free.  Because we advertise so much, our experience and our common sense tells us that the majority of people doing internet searches for the words TurboTax free tax preparation are looking for TurboTax free product, not the one we offer through the IRS free file program.  That said, we didn't want to assume.  We wanted to make the distinction between our free products crystal clear by educating customers.  To do that, we implemented a multi-faceted marketing campaign for the product we offer through the IRS Free File Program.  One important portion of the campaign was search, and that included spending money on paid search and syndicating large amounts of content we created.  like product differences, eligibility, requirements, and FAQs.  We did this so that the right content would be more easily found by eligible consumers.  And that approach worked, with our IRS educational content showing up at the top of the search results.  To avoid confusion between the IRS Free File Program and our own free product, We also decided to have the landing page for the IRS product we offer not rank in search results.  That way, information about product differences and FAQs would be more easily found to help taxpayers make the right decision for them.  Having pages not rank is standard internet practice, and it's especially helpful in this instance where our primary goal is to get people the right product through educational content.  If that's confusing, You're not alone.  For some, this decision has been misinterpreted to signal that we were trying to hide the product we offer in the IRS program.  That is inaccurate, and it's counter to our commitment to the success of the IRS free file program.  Our choice around search was intended to be the best interest of taxpayers so they were more fully informed about their options and could choose what they felt was best for them.  But given the misinterpretation of our well-intended actions, we decided to remove the limitations we put in place.  We're also evaluating other options we could take to further clarify the product choices that our consumers have so they can select what is best for them and their tax filing circumstances.  Now, more recently, people are connecting dots that don't exist and are making accusations about our commitment to the idea of free offerings altogether.  They say free isn't really free.  Those people are wrong.  What they are saying is not true, not even close.  Millions of taxpayers filed for free this year using one of our free products.  To be clear, they didn't pay us anything.  Will they pay us for services at some point in the future?  Maybe.  Our hope is that over the lifetime of a customer, as their life experiences change and become more complex, they will choose one of our paid products and enjoy the additional benefits those products offer.  That is not something we should apologize for.  That's growing with our customers and solving their most important problems, no matter their life situation.  Team, At the end of the day, we have built a vibrant tax business by delivering benefits taxpayers want and products they love, empowering them to manage their financial lives.  That absolutely includes the free options I've been describing, as well as all the amazing value added innovations and benefits we introduce that raise the bar for our commercial TurboTax product.  Now, is there something we can learn from this?  Absolutely.  If a decision we make can't be easily explained or understood in the court of public opinion, we should choose a different path.  This is an important lesson in life.  So intent can match perception.  I love who we are.  I love what we stand for.  And I'm extremely proud of what we have built together, how we've built it and how we conduct ourselves.  Our value of integrity without compromise will always guide our decisions.  And if we make a mistake, we'll learn and improve.  But we will also correct the record when we are unfairly treated for something we did not do like we are now.  My commitment is to continue to be transparent with you.  Now let's stay focused on our customers and power prosperity around the world.  You are doing incredible work.  Keep up the great job.  We stand together and we stand tall.  Thank you for all that you do every day. ",
