            "text": "Is this working?  Why is my room lighting always freaking weird, man?  hi YouTube family.  how are you happy 2019?  I know I lag.  it's been two months ish.  it's been nine weeks but welcome welcome welcome to 2019.  I know I haven't updated videos in a minute.  I've kind of had really a lot of technical difficulties.  both of my laptops just don't want me to make this so I. It's been tricky.  They've both been giving me some serious issues.  And right now I'm trying to get re-healthy?  Is that the word?  I don't know.  I've been sick.  I've been sick for like, I don't know, two weeks now?  I want to say.  So a couple of really exciting stuff that has happened recently.  So just a little quick at life update.  In January I went on an amazing trip with my girlfriend Kelly Hill to Florida.  I didn't make any YouTube videos from there because I was instastoring like crazy.  So if you want to catch up with that funny, amazing, crazy, insane trip, head over to my Instagram and it's in my highlight under Florida.  So you should see it there.  really fun and funny and stuff.  and we did really cool stuff.  I mean we hung out with penguins we ziplined I don't even know.  we just did a bunch of wildly crazy stuff and we did a little road trip so that was really fun and then I got sick.  so I had to cancel another press trip that I had at the end of January and February.  I spent An insane amount of time, I'll say that.  That's like understating it.  In February, I spent most of the month trying to finish my Lightroom presets so you guys can edit your photos like I edit my photos.  I was super excited about this project.  I was nervous to release it.  I worked my life off, my soul off.  Had a million breakdowns and cried a thousand times with frustration trying to figure out little technical stuff.  that took, some of them took days.  like over eleven hours a day times like five days to just figure out like really small intimate details.  but so I'm gonna make another video talking more about my presets.  but I do want to say that definitely check them out.  I worked really hard on them.  I wanted to make them perfect.  I've initially been working on them for half a year.  Yeah, I've been working them for half a year, but I was like, okay, I've got to finish this.  This was one of my 2019 goals.  So I finished them.  I released them.  If you want to check them out, go to VanillaSkyDreamingShop.com.  I have six collections, and they're all inspired by my favorite countries and cities and destinations of the world.  You guys know I love to go to the Caribbean, and Tulum is like my life.  I want to move there.  There's a whole collection, the Caribbean Paradise collection.  Vanilla Sky Sunsets is a collection featuring a bunch of really cool sunsets edits that I do.  Clearly, I'm the sunset queen.  I mean, let's just be real.  My blog is named Vanilla Sky for sunsets, for my love for sunsets.  There's also the Desert Storm collection, which is inspired by Coachella and Palm Springs and Joshua Tree.  Loves of my life.  I've been trying to go out there, but it keeps snowing, so hopefully I can make a trip out there pretty soon.  And then we also have the Icelandic Fire and Ice Collection, which is inspired by my favorite country in the world, Iceland.  And also the Maldives Pastel Collection, which is inspired by my love for the Maldives.  My gosh, one of the best trips of my entire life.  Oh my god, I love it.  And I'm missing one more.  I believe it's the Mystic Falls Darkness Collection, which is... such a love of mine because I was playing around with colors for a while and maybe I was going through a dark phase.  I mean, I don't even know what it was.  Yeah, I kind of want to say that I was, but I was also fascinated.  I always love to play with colors and editing stuff and I... Really fell in love with these dark tones.  I kind of created this collection.  It was around Halloween time, but also November and fall time where I would take like day and kind of make it look like daylight savings or night.  Like I would take sunsets and make them look like early sunrises of, I don't know, I call them vampire vibes.  It's inspired by a lot of different things.  Very mystical, cool, but you can also use them in like cool cities.  It makes, I don't know, it just... I love that collection and then you have the one that has everything.  I can literally talk about them forever because I'm just so passionate about editing photos.  Editing photos is like literally one, I think like the love of my career.  Taking pictures and editing pictures, I have so much love for it.  I just love creating art.  Like it's really inspiring to me just like the whole process of taking a photo.  More.  so, I mean, it's just, it's the whole thing.  It's kind of like visualizing a location, researching the location, visualizing it, creating, like, you know, an image and a story that you want to tell behind that, and then going out there hoping that your vision comes to life, like, visually in your mind with the perfect dress and the hair and, like, the lighting and everything, and then taking that raw photo and editing it and just taking the photo to life.  There's a whole, really, science and, like... I don't know, there's a whole science about this, definitely.  Um, but I just, I love creating art through photography, and then my second love would be, like, editing videos and creating videos, um, for you guys.  So, yes!  Wow, I'm talking so much and so fast, especially for a sick girl, so hold on one sec.  So, I also want to gift you guys, um, with a little gift from me, so if you're watching this video, um, head on over... to my preset website and put in the discount code YOUTUBE15 and it will generate a 15% off all of your sale, whatever.  You choose to buy whatever preset from the big one or the small ones.  Go try it on me.  On the house.  Super exciting.  And I'm so grateful to say thank you to all of you guys for watching my videos.  It really means the world to me.  I just noticed like a week or so ago that I hit a million views altogether with all my videos.  That's amazing.  Huge milestone.  So grateful.  Also super excited.  My blog turns five tomorrow.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Dot com.  Crazy.  Also, I'm almost at 100,000 followers on Instagram.  Super grateful.  I feel like there's one more thing that I'm missing, but I'm just full of gratitude.  So I really just want to take the moment to say thank you.  Thank you for following me, for listening to me, for commenting and liking and sending questions and just, I don't know, being fascinated with my life and my stories and what I have to put out there.  It really means a lot to me.  I want to create a video about that.  I feel like a lot of stages early in my career, there was a lot of times where I had a lot of self-doubt.  Like, is anybody even listening?  Does anybody really care?  Yeah, I think it's just as an artist, it just kind of happens a lot.  You know, there's like highs and then there's lows where you're like doubting yourself.  And, you know, one minute you're like flying on shooting stars.  Next minute you're like, wait, why is no one commenting?  Why is no one watching fast enough?  And you start to doubt yourself and you doubt if you're actually like making a difference into people's lives.  And the last half a year, more than ever, I've kind of struggled with like, I guess, Trying to figure out if, I don't know how to explain it really.  I guess, I know that I have a really important message to share with the world.  And I was struggling with trying to understand if people really cared for what I have to say.  Yeah, so I've had a lot of struggles with it in the last half a year.  a lot of self-doubt, a lot of questioning, a lot of comparing myself to other people, and I've really leaned off of it and I feel like, I'm like, I'm still, it's a work in progress, but I feel like I'm a lot happier now that I've just kind of taken the stuff back from trying to compare myself to other people and asking why does this person have this many views or this many likes?  or, it's frustrating, it's annoying, and yet, I feel like you just, just create art, just create art, and good things will happen.  I'm currently planning my next great adventure.  Every month if you talk to me there's a different city I want to go to, different country, continent, city.  Different things inspire me all the time and I think that's really important to always be growing.  finding new inspirations, like I love that about myself.  So yeah, impulsive or too much for the average person, me just, I don't know.  I'm just, I'm always getting inspired.  I don't want to say until it's booked.  So for now I'm kind of playing with a few different locations.  So we'll see how that goes. ",
