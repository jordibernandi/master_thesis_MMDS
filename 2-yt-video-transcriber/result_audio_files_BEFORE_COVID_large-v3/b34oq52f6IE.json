            "text": "Howdy folks, Kel here.  Well, I've got the El Redondo Flor de Lanza Pyramid Cigar, which I cut the end off previously in another video.  And I feel like it could be a little bit better draw than it is, and so I'm going to demonstrate the perfect draw cigar tool here.  This is a wonderful little item.  About 30 to 40 bucks, depending where you buy it.  I would just go to the website.  It's perfectdraw.com.  I'll put a link below in the description below.  No, I'm not affiliated.  They didn't give me this for free or anything like that.  I wish they had.  But this guy is an inventor.  Actually, he's a dentist, I think.  He was already doing quite well, but he likes cigars.  He decided to make a tool to fix the draws on cigars.  It's very simple.  It has little barbs on the end here.  I don't know if you can see that or not.  And what you do is... You put it at the end of the cigar, and once you've cut it and decided you maybe need a little bit of loosening, and you screw it in like a screw, and then you pull out like that.  And in this kind of a pyramid cigar, very often, the tightness is in this section right here.  And you want to make it going straight, otherwise you can kind of go around off the side of your cigar, and that is not good for the cigar.  Not good for smoking.  You'll ruin your cigar.  And I did that with one cigar, because I was going way deep in.  Kind of a bit of a clut sometimes.  So you twist it in, you pull it out, and you see that tobacco coming out of there.  And I try to do it in a couple different spots.  Off to the side, the middle, the other side.  As long as you can feel it in there.  I just kind of felt like I was coming across some tight spots right there.  Again, I'm going on the other side now.  We want to kind of do a spoke wheel type thing where you go to the middle and then around a little bit.  I find it's a good idea.  See all that stuff that came out at that time, right?  See that?  And I tend to go overboard probably a little bit.  And I would generally do this on my desk in my room because I don't want tobacco all over me, which it is now.  But I thought I'd just demonstrate this to the camera.  A few pokes, a few draws, and it's much better.  And also, I generally take the cigar.  This is my ashtray, and I would just kind of thump it on something, gently.  Just get a little piece of tobacco, I don't know if you can see this, but a bunch of tobacco just came off the end, because you don't want to be smoking that.  See this?  It doesn't matter.  But that's all there is to it.  It takes a minute or so, and it changes the cigar from a cigar which might be okay, or even a cigar that has a bad draw into a cigar with a really good draw.  So, I highly recommend this tool.  So that is a perfect draw.  It actually took the cigar from being not a bad draw to a perfect draw.  And I'll end up now and I'll smoke it.  Thanks for watching.
