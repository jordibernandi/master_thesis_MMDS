            "text": "Hello friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor here.  It's been a little while since we've done a Prophecy News update, but some things happened this week that we think should really capture the attention of most people, especially Protestants.  I don't know if you're aware of what the Pope did on Thursday, September 12, but he had a special video where he is now setting up a date to establish a global pact with the leaders of the world to re-educate the young people of the world.  This was also presented by the Vatican in written form, as well as the Pope himself reading it on a video.  And the date is May 14, 2020, and he's calling for the leaders of the world to come.  Well, let's just play this video.  You'll have it here on your screen. ",

            "text": "Oh, got to stop it already.  First thing he does when he presents this video is he references his encyclical that was Leiado Se from 2015.  And this was the Pope's encyclical on the environment.  And in this, please don't miss, he starts this whole video by referencing his famous encyclical on the environment, which says on paragraph 237, on Sunday, our participation in the Eucharist has a special importance.  Sunday, like the Jewish Sabbath, is meant to be a day which heals our relationships with God, with ourselves, with others, and with the world.  Now, of course, this whole encyclical on the environment is talking about what we can do to save the world, the environment, and help prevent or reverse global warming.  And he actually is implying that by keeping the Sabbath and even says going to church on Sunday, we'd let the environment rest.  I'll read on here.  It says the Sunday is the day of the resurrection, the first day of the new creation, whose first fruits are the Lord's risen humanity.  and the pledge of the final transfiguration of all created reality.  It also proclaims man's eternal rest, the law of weekly rest for bad work on the seventh day.  He agrees it's the seventh day.  And so that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and the son of your maidservant and the stranger might be refreshed.  Rest opens our eyes to the larger picture and gives us renewed sensitivity to the rights of others.  So he's basically saying that, you know, by resting and resting people, animals, the environment, it's going to help contribute towards this saving of the environment.  So don't miss the point that he begins his comments by referencing his encyclical dealing with the environment. ",

And a compact, of course, is a firm contract, promise, treaty, or an agreement.  So he's calling on everybody to come together.  I wonder who's going to write that out.  I say facetiously, it'll probably be produced by the Vatican.  And have everyone agreed that we need to re-educate the world on what we need to do to save the environment.  So he says we're going to promote this global event that is going to create a new universal solidarity.  Now that solidarity means a new unity, and that's been his mantra through his papacy, and a new humanism.  He talks about, you wonder, what does a new humanism mean?  which will be held on May 14, So he's giving the date.  It's going to happen on the 14th of May, 2020.  He's inviting everyone to Rome.  It's still not clear if it's actually going to be in the Vatican.  The Vatican may not be big enough to house the gathering.  I think they're waiting to see how many and which world leaders will respond to this invitation to agree to a new education.  So he's saying we're living in a time of great fragmentation, of great division.  We need to get mature people.  So he's saying those that come, they're the mature ones.  that are going to agree.  this is the only way we're going to really save the world.  Come together. ",

And the Pope earlier this year in February made an unprecedented trip, first time any Pope, has been to Saudi Arabia.  Keep in mind, Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Muhammad and the stronghold of Islam.  I've been there several times.  It's got the biggest mosque in the world.  I've been there and we did some taping there.  It is an amazing thing.  When we were there meeting with Christians, it was extremely controlled.  You couldn't meet right in the city.  They put the Christians in this like compound enclaves outside of the city.  And to let the Pope come in just really shocked me that they would do that, because there may even be more expatriate people from outside of Abu Dhabi that work in Abu Dhabi, and many of them Filipinos or Catholic.  And there's about a million Catholics in this Islamic country.  and tens of thousands of them came out when the Pope went and he went with the Grand Imam and they embraced each other and he embraced the King and was warmly welcomed.  They rolled out the red carpet.  And you're wondering, what's going on here?  Now I've said before in other videos, don't miss the point that you've got the King of the North and the King of the South, two of the principal religions in the world, are christianity 2.2 billion people.  and then you've got islam with 1.7 billion people.  and he said it's so important for us to first establish that we've got a joint document between these two religions and world powers so there can be peace and harmony.  so that's the reason i think he's mentioning that that document is talking about respecting the freedoms of different religions.  Another reason Saudi Arabia might be very relevant.  now in the scheme of prophecy is two days ago, it appears Iran has bombed these oil fields in Saudi Arabia.  that has the potential to really accelerate the tensions in the Middle East right now.  That's why the Pope, I think, is mentioning this. ",

Man was originally designed to be a steward of God's garden in Eden.  And so it all sounds beautiful, but I think you need to read between the lines knowing what's going on in Bible prophecy.  This is a very profound and stunning new advancement in the ongoing agenda of the Pope to move towards bringing together the religions of the world and the political leaders of the world, and it's being done for the children, for the environment.

A part of what he's saying there is we need to spread the wealth around, which always applies to the masses of the world, which would love to hear that.  But right there again, he encompassed the politics, the nations of the world, the economy of the world.  Everything needs to be addressed in this global pact.  So now he's saying it's not just that.  we're going to train the children.  He said this is going to be a program that we will train willing individuals to train the children.  So how could you reject an invitation from the Pope?  He's inviting the leaders to come.  He says, I want to meet you in Rome so that we can promote this educational alliance, a global educational alliance of the world.  Now he's saying, not only am I sending a personal invitation to the public leaders of the world, I want you to join me in urging them to participate in this.  So he's actually going right to the grassroots people and saying, you tell your world leaders, the political leaders, the business leaders, the economic leaders, he even says sports personalities, anyone that has influence, there to be encouraged by the people to come to this meeting where they will sign a global pact.  Makes you wonder.  I mean, maybe it's harmless, but it makes the, believe it or not, the hair stand up on my neck.  So we're going to educate future generations and we will not back down.  That's what he just said.  I think it's interesting.  He said, we'll get together and we'll try and find solutions.  You can almost be sure that when they arrive, there'll be something already written.  Typically, it's a law of life, but the one who sets the date for a meeting, who sets the agenda for the meeting, who says the place for the meeting is leading the meeting.  And so there's no question about who is in charge here of this meeting.  Calls an alliance.  Thank you.  He gives out his blessing.  He says, I'm looking forward.  I expect to see you there.  And this is a very direct appeal to the people and to the leaders of the world to come May 14, 2020 to Rome.  It may be in some larger assembly area or even in the Vatican where he's going to say, we need a global pact to bring the world together.  to educate our young people to help save the environment and tangible things we can do.  And he starts out by referencing his encyclical on the environment where he specifically mentions the Sabbath, among other things.  Well, friends, I couldn't let this pass without saying something about it.  Something else that was in the article that was issued by the Vatican on this.  It says, we're inviting international organizations.  And you can look these things up at the Vatican websites for yourself.  We're inviting international organizations.  And note this, the great ones of the earth.  Boy, that jumped out at me because it sounds exactly like Revelation 18, where it says, the merchants of Babylon, the great ones of the earth.  That's what it says in the Bible.  By which all the nations of the earth were deceived with Satan's sorcery.  Maybe I'm the only one that thinks that this is something to keep our eyes on.  it will be very interesting to see how many Protestant leaders and educators and from where respond to this invitation saying, sign me up, I'm coming, Pope.  I'd like to find out more about this global pact.  And we need to be praying as that day approaches.  You know, the Bible tells us that the wheel of prophecy may turn slowly, but it turns surely and truly.  And I think we've just seen another cog in the wheel, another tick of the hand, another ding in the bell.  of God's prophecy clock.  So we'd encourage you to look at our video called The Bride, The Beast, and Babylon.  It helps you understand why issues like this are important, very important at the website here.  There'll be a link, I think, where you can look and see how you can get more information about that.  Also encourage you to have your friends like this video, pass it on.  Every time they like it, it makes it easier for other people to find it.  Be praying and stay tuned until we have our next prophecy news update. ",
