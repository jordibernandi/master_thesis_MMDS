            "text": "so i've refrained from posting anything about the american psychological association's guidelines for psychological practice with men and boys because i'm not a psychologist and who cares?  what i think what i have been doing is reading and listening to what a lot of psychologists have been saying about it.  now if you haven't been following this last month the american psychological association declared that traditional masculinity marked by stoicism competitiveness dominance and aggression is on the whole harmful.  men socialized in this way say the apa are less likely to engage in healthy behaviors.  now in the subsequent weeks and after much criticism the apas felt the need to clarify their statement that it's only extreme stereotypical behaviors and not being a traditional male that may result in negative outcomes but that modification hasn't done much to allay the concerns of professional psychologists and other academics.  On Monday, Colette published the response of 12 scholars to the APA's guidance, and Jordan Peterson penned a piece in the Canadian National Post last Friday.  Now, don't worry, I'm not going to read them to you verbatim.  You can do that in your own time.  I just wanted to pick out a few key points that I thought were interesting.  In his article, Jordan Peterson claims that the guidelines indicate the takeover of the APA by ideologues, and he takes issue with some of the key concepts in the document.  Peterson argues that there is no consensus among psychologists about the definition, let alone the existence of, for example, masculinity ideology.  There's also no agreement that gender exists solely in the form of roles that are learned or as opposed to innate and there is absolutely no indication in the guidelines that these concepts or their definitions constitute the axioms of a primarily political viewpoint.  instead they are presented as if they were foundational scientifically credible and beyond question.  Probably the most damning indictment of the guidelines documented by Peterson is the idea that it is the socialization of boys and men by men that is producing both a decrement in the personal mental health of males and females and a threat to the social fabric.  Peterson says not only is this claim factually wrong, but that it's wrong in a manner that is directly antithetical to the truth.  Peterson poses the question, what kind of families produce violent young men?  Fatherless families.  The pernicious effect of fatherlessness is exceptionally well documented.  No serious researchers question it.  Even the generally damnable sociologists admit it, and he cites an example.  Fatherless boys are overrepresented as alcoholics, addicts, gang members, prisoners, rapists, and murderers.  If it is fatherless boys who are violent, how can it be that masculine socialization produces both harm to mental health and society?  The data should indicate precisely the opposite.  And according to the Pew Research Organization, in the US in 2017, a quarter of all children live with a single parent.  One in five live with a single mother.  Almost half, 47% of black children live with a single mother, as opposed to 13% for whites and just 7% for Asians.  And of course, that correlates with perpetration rates of violent crime.  Now, moving on to the Quillette article, many of the same criticisms Peterson brought up are repeated again, that the guidelines lack conceptual integrity and are infused with socio-political ideology.  Professor of psychology Chris Ferguson says that the APA has a poor track record of biased and scientifically misleading policy statements, including practice guidelines.  He says in many cases, statements are developed by scholars reviewing their own work and declaring it beyond debate, a clear conflict of interest.  At present, the APA's policy statements often read like marketing tools rather than objective reviews.  Clinical psychologist Sean Smith writes, If the APA were truly concerned about males, they would strive to help those who are suffering by building on the time-tested virtues of masculinity.  Instead, they frame the patriarchy, that nebulous betenoir of radical feminism, as the root of all suffering.  seeing the world through that tainted lens.  their response to men and boys can only be that of the radical feminists tear men down denigrate noble traits advance feminist ideology at all costs.  people generally seek psychologists in moments of vulnerability.  it is plain vicious to seize on that vulnerability for the sake of advancing an ideology.  ironically the apa's mercenary approach to the culture war a war in which they have no business taking sides exemplifies the destructive and ruthless qualities they wrongly attribute to honorable men everywhere.  by the way sean smith has a youtube channel with some interesting videos such as should you date a feminist spoiler alert?  of course you shouldn't.  i'll put a link to his channel in the comments below.  dr deborah so says.  she has several concerns with the guidelines.  for starters the belief that masculinity is an ideology socially constructed and learned during socialization as opposed to biological and the result of hormonal influence.  secondly the guidelines portray abusive behavior as a natural extension of being male typical as opposed to being due to anti-sociality and negative views about women.  if we were to follow this suggested line of thinking masculinity should be something that can be corrected and unlearned.  as someone who has worked clinically with incarcerated male sexual offenders and violent offenders i can tell you that therapeutic interventions informed by intersectional feminism and its ideas about power and privilege will have zero effect when working with these populations.  but it's not all bad news.  christina hoffsommers notes that buried beneath the gender studies rhetoric there are some sensible suggestions for example for boys and adolescents shorter sessions informal settings outside the office e g playground instrumental activities using humor and self-disclosure may provide more congruent environments than traditional psychotherapy.  at least that's some recognition that boys socialize in a different way and that making them behave like girls is probably not the best idea.  somers also notes in the guidelines psychologists are encouraged to advocate for public policy that supports and enhances teenage boys career prospects.  clearly the feminists must have missed that part or they'd be up in arms about it.  i'm sure she also notes that the authors stress the importance of fathers but i think it's the last paragraph that makes the most interesting point about these guidelines.  So why did they bury their message in distracting passages about Eurocentric masculine ideals of restrictive emotionality?  Here's my best guess.  In our current male-averse environment, the only way to help men and boys is to pay homage to the gender dogmas, then quietly insert some sound and critical advice and hope no one notices, even the authors themselves.  If that's true, what a sad indictment of the APA.  Now, before I go, I just wanted to let you know that Subscribestar sent me an email yesterday telling me that my billing capabilities have been restored, which is good news.  And for those of you that have subscribed, I will be getting the February version of the Deep Dive out to you sometime this weekend.  However, given what has happened with Patreon and Maker Support before that, I don't have a whole lot of faith in these platforms being around for the long haul.  So I'm going to build those features into my new website, which will be online hopefully late this month, early next month.  And speaking of the new website, one feature I was toying with was an audio-only version of my videos that you can download and listen to at your leisure.  So if you have five seconds to spare, please click in the top right corner of your screen now to answer a poll question on whether you're interested in an audio-only version of my videos.  And of course, while you're there, don't forget to like, share, and subscribe.  And better still, click on that bell icon so you receive notifications straight to your inbox whenever I upload a new video.  and until then I'll see you next time. ",
