There's not much I can do about that.  He's playing Fortnite right now.  But the video that we're responding to today is a video from Jaronism.  Not just any video from Jaronism.  It's a video from Jaronism.  where he shows a snippet of a podcast that he was on, where he presents his own video.  So this is a video of Jaren.  on a podcast of Jaren.  on a video from Jaren.  Yeah, I know.  That's crazy.  It's a bit of a backwards way of doing it.  And I know that I could have traced back and went to the original video that Jaren made, but I decided to respond to this video specifically for a number of reasons.  Not the least of which being that this is the first one I came across and I couldn't be bothered, but also because he seems to actually do a decent job of recapping the original video, even though he just takes a 45 minute video and put it into like 30 minutes.  So, I mean, not much of a point there.  But I also just kind of wanted to show you guys what it was like, what it's like to actually watch and go through these Flat Earth videos.  Because I'll often try to find the best Flat Earth videos where they present their point clearly, they get to the point, something that's actually bearable to sit through, and I try to cut to the most relevant parts where they explain their points the clearest and in the most concise way.  But it isn't always like that.  Sometimes it's just a video of a podcast of a video.  So this is that. ",

But the thing is, flat earthers, or geocentrists, because apparently they're the same thing now, they're not looked down upon because they're questioning these things, because they're researching and looking into these things.  In fact, I admire that you're researching and trying to understand even simple things like the shape of the Earth.  Genuine skepticism I'm okay with, but skepticism isn't the same thing as denial.  Now, I don't know Charonism's specific ideas in regards to the Flat Earth, but when Flat Earthers in general do things like deny the existence of gravity and insist that buoyancy can replace it, they really show that they don't know what they're talking about, because they obviously don't understand that gravity causes buoyancy in the first place, and that buoyancy only pushes things up.  So, buoyancy cannot replace gravity, and saying stuff like that are what make people think that flat earthers are ridiculous.

I'm not actually going to answer that question, but I just want you to think about how to recognize someone who acts or maybe even feels like he knows more than he really does. ",

And we thought that the whole solar system was moving through this luminiferous aether.  right that means that from the ground relative to us it would seem like this luminiferous aether was travelling past us and this is a phenomenon that we called aether wind.  then experiments such as ary's failure attempted to detect this aether wind And they didn't.  The results were negative.  At first, this seemed to indicate that the Earth wasn't moving through this aether, and hence the stationary Earth idea.
