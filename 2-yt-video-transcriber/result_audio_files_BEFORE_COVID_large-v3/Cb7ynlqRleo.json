            "text": "All esteem to the Most High Elohim.  This is your brother El.  Once again, we're out here enjoying the beautiful nature of the Most High, relaxing and just soaking up the spirit of the Most High and clearing our minds.  Wanted to come to speak about a very powerful topic today that as the people of the Most High, the earth is ours.  Let's go through this history for a moment.  We know that whenever our forefathers, the original man and woman that the scripture calls Adam and Eve were in the garden of the earth, that garden was their real estate.  It was their property.  It was their ownership given to them by the Most High.  Now, there was a gentrifier, if we could use the term gentrifier, because... In all our communities all over the world right now, we have gentrifiers, people that are coming in to claim land that is not theirs.  The same thing happened in the Garden of Eden to the original man and woman, where there was a gentrifier that came in to that property and that land, and that inheritance was stripped from them due to deception, due to fraudulence.  And that's the same thing that has happened to our people through deception, treachery, fraudulence.  This earth that is our paradise that was given to us by the most high, just like the garden was given to Adam and Eve, just like the earth was given to Adam and Eve, it has been usurped.  Now, let's fast forward.  After that garden and that earth was usurped by that gentrifier and that enemy, a man came, the Messiah came, and through his power, through his strength, he legally took back ownership of the earth.  Now, let's fast forward from the Messiah all the way to us today.  We've been spread throughout all four corners of the earth.  What did the Most High tell Joshua in Joshua chapter 1?  He said, wherever the sole of your foot shall tread, it shall be yours.  Now, our people, the children of Israel, our feet have tread all across the four corners of the earth.  We have been dispersed to all four corners of the earth.  Our feet have treaded to all four corners of the earth.  And the Most High told Joshua that wherever your feet tread, it shall be yours.  Now, think about what the Messiah also told us.  What did he say?  When this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to all four corners of the earth, then the end shall come.  So what we have here is we have our people being dispersed to all four corners of the earth and our feet have treaded all four corners of the earth.  And the most high gave us a promise through Joshua that wherever our foot treaded, it will be ours.  Now let's take it over to the book of second Ezra's chapter six verses 56 through 59.  What does the prophet Ezra say?  Whenever he's speaking to the most top, he says that the earth is ours as an inheritance.  And these usurpers are living on this inheritance as if it is theirs.  Now remember the scripture, the meek shall inherit the earth.  Remember, we're talking about inheritance.  We're talking about legal claim to something that is ours from the beginning.  And remember what I said.  In the beginning, it was a gentrifier, an usurper that went into the garden to illegally, by fraudulence and deception, claim rights to that land.  That land was taken back by the Messiah through his blood.  Now, what does the Messiah tell us in Revelation chapter two and chapter three?  He lets us know that he will give power to those who overcome and they shall rule the earth with a rod of iron as he rules with a rod of iron.  So in the scripture, the right of the inheritance goes to the firstborn.  The most high, the earth belongs to him.  He gave that inheritance to his son and his son as the rightful inheritor has given it to his people.  that has been spread to all four corners of the earth.  The earth is ours through inheritance.  Because what does the scripture say?  Israel is my firstborn.  As the firstborn, we the people of the most high through the Messiah have rights to the earth.  The meek shall inherit the earth.  The Messiah, who has rightful control over the earth, whenever he dominated, whenever he resurrected, has given that power to the righteous who overcome.  So what that means, brothers and sisters, in a nutshell, the earth is ours.  The earth is ours.  All this that you see right now belongs to the people of the Most High.  All of it.  And this is how we need to start thinking that the earth is ours.  And when we have that type of mentality, it will make us defend our crown.  It will make us defend what we own.  Because whenever the Messiah returns, he's coming back for that deed, that property deed, that property deed of the earth to give it to its rightful owners.  and the rightful owners of this earth are the people of the most high.  We lost it in the garden, we got it back through the Messiah, and the same gentrifiers that went in in the garden to usurp land through fraudulence and deceit, they're gonna be removed.  No more to gentrify our earth like they gentrify all our communities from Harlem to Jerusalem to California, all the streets of California, Los Angeles.  It's going to be reverse gentrification whenever the people of the most high get that inheritance back. ",
