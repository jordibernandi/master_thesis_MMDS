            "text": "You've done videos with several known YouTubers in the skeptic community, including Lloyd Evans, Rationality Rules, Rachel Oates.  And you were even invited on the very popular Christian radio show, Unbelievable Show, which I subscribe to myself.  That often has a theist and an atheist in the studio.  And you were pitted against Christian apologist Frank Turek, someone I've debunked myself on my own channel.  But you were face to face with him.  You were sitting right next to him because we could see the video as well.  So what was that like for you? ",

            "text": "It was interesting.  I mean, I knew that I was sat next to a man who said that if God told him to murder his children, he'd do it.  He said that in front of a college audience.  And it kind of didn't escape me that that's the kind of person I was sat next to.  But at the same time, he was a perfectly nice man.  I mean, he was very friendly, very eager to shake your hand and and ask you about how you're doing, he emails me every now and again.  I've had emails from him asking me about what I'm up to, how the education is going, and things like this.  And he seems like a perfectly nice man, and he is, I would imagine.  It's one of these examples of how a perfectly perfectly agreeable human being, manages to hold incredibly corrupt views.  It's an interesting thing to see in person.  But actually debating him was an interesting experience because here's a man who's had a lot of experience in it.  I mean, he does it as a job.  He goes to college campuses.  He's debated many, many people.  He's debated David Silverman.  He debated Christopher Hitchens.  And here I was had across the table from him.  Immediately, it was bogged down with definitional issues, like trying to determine what we really mean by atheists, what we really mean by God or morality.  And these didn't necessarily hold too much relevance to the conversation that we were trying to have. ",

            "text": "Yeah, in a way.  I found it very difficult to get past the definition of atheism when we weren't even really talking about that.  We were talking about morality, and he was trying to kind of press me on it, and he was saying, well, if you're going to say that atheism is a lack of belief in God, then this book is an atheist.  And I'm thinking, well, this holds no relevance to the conversation.  And it's like, if you define a vegan as someone who doesn't eat meat, then... this book is also a vegan.  It's pointless.  It's a fatuous thing to be doing.  Finally kind of got through and the main, the only part of the debate that I think was really worth sort of going for, the thing that made me feel, yes, it was probably worth my time having this discussion was at the point when Turek does what he often does, which is accuse somebody of circular reasoning, because they use the reason that they have to justify the fact that, or no, it's that we know that evolution is a fact because of reason.  that we got through evolution.  I mean, evolution gave us our reason, and we're now using our reason to uncover the fact that evolution occurred.  And he said this is circular reasoning.  And I said, well, hold on.  You think that God exists, for instance.  Why do you think that God exists?  Through reason.  And where did you get your reason from?  From God.  If you're using a reason that you got from God to reason that God exists, then you're also being circular.  Now, I don't think that's circular reasoning.  I mean, that's not what circular reasoning is.  But if you're going to say that that's what I'm doing, then you're doing it too.  And then the conversation kind of moved on.  But that moment of clashing made me realize that... He's accusing people of making logical fallacies, which aren't actually logical fallacies, but that even if they were, he'd be committing them too.  So it was a good opportunity to be able to kind of think of that while I was sat next to him.  And the fact that I was able to think of that and say it to him, I'm certainly glad for.  But it made it a fun experience overall.  I'm glad to have done it.  Thank you. ",
