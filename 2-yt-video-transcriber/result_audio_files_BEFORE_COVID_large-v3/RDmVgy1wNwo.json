            "text": "The European Union begged the UK to help them with Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt comes out again to stop the whole process, and Barry Gardiner considers running for Labour leadership.  Yes, it's truly exciting times to be living in.  We're going to talk about a lot in this video.  Obviously, Barry Gardner is considering running for Labour leadership, which is hilarious.  But let's talk about Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission.  Now, as you remember, since 2016, the European Union have had the upper hand with the whole Brexit process on every level, because firstly, Theresa May decided to give the full control of the whole process of negotiations to civil servants and also she decided to accidentally sabotage her own conservative majority in parliament so the government lost control of the whole agenda.  the European Union did whatever they wanted to do but this isn't the first time because over the last few decades we've had so many weak and feeble prime ministers from Brown to Blair and everybody else who've been giving away so much to Brussels.  Not anymore.  Things are changing.  Earlier this week Ursula von der Leyen and the EU Commission officials came to London to speak to the Prime Minister and the UK government because they're very concerned that this hard deadline that Boris Johnson has created is not enough.  so the uk will be leaving the eu at the end of this month and then obviously both sides have this one year transition period actually less than a year until the end of december to come up with a free trade agreement.  otherwise goodbye.  and so she's very concerned because it's not enough time for the eu because we know what they want to do.  they don't want to actually negotiate a free trade deal they want us to make.  they want to make sure that we are politically aligned to everything that they have.  and boris johnson has already said no and uh so that didn't really go well for her that meeting.  so what she decided to do?  ursula von der leyen?  run on tv and at a press conference and she created new red lines which are absolutely ridiculous.  firstly free movement.

            "text": "Yeah, that didn't really go well for Ursula von der Leyen because Boris Johnson immediately confirmed that the UK will be completely free.  No free movement, no ECJ, no single market and no customs union.  So what they decided to do instead was that the next move has been over the last week or so is to basically target the Falkland Islands.  yeah the falklands seriously as if we didn't have no problems with the argentines over there.  so the eu are going after the falklands because of the fisheries.  and uh yeah now at the moment the eu fishermen travel thousands of miles to the waters near the falkland islands to catch a particular species of squid known as loliko.  but now these eu fishermen fear that brexit could jeopardize this multi-million pound industry and harm thousands of jobs across the European Union.  Now, they're freaking out because Boris Johnson has clarified once again that the UK will take back control of our waters wherever it is.  Yeah, that's the other thing they've been trying to do since 2016.  They've been trying to find loopholes in the negotiations to make sure that they have full access to UK waters even after Brexit.  And now, obviously, we're going to have a situation where depending on what sort of trade deal we sign it has to be mutually beneficial.  you can't just have the EU fishermen going around and we don't because we've had this problem with the French near actually where we are rather than the Falkland Islands but we'll see how it goes.  and so far UK government have been strong about this and this is why Guy Verhofstadt is freaking out.  So one of our favorite European Union officials in the European Parliament is now going around because he's been trying over the last week or so.  He tried to use the European Parliament to block Brexit again.  He didn't realize that's not going to work because so obviously the European Parliament have to at the end approve the Brexit deal.  And he didn't realize this because If you don't approve it, then the UK will leave without a deal at the end of January.  It's not a situation where if you block the deal, then the UK will automatically ask for an extension.  The UK so far have been asking for an extension because the Parliament has been full of Remainers and they've been asking for extension.  this time it's different.  so Guy Verhofstadt that failed.  so what he's trying to do now is to create new red lines when it comes to the EU citizens rights.  now the UK government have already said that we are giving maintaining the rights for EU citizens who are already here but what Guy Verhofstadt wants is to give extra rights which includes family members and everybody to basically come here as well.  yeah good luck with that.

And I want to do an appeal to the Prime Minister of Britain, to Boris Johnson, to be generous in his victory.  and to give to all the European citizens and the British citizens alike living in the continent on the continent the full rights as they have today automatically to all of them.  no ifs and no buts as he always says to do.

            "text": "Now my problem with that part of the speech was he basically again called Brexit and Brexiteers stupid.  Now, again, they never learn.  There's something about these European liberals.  There's absolutely nothing liberal about them.  They have no respect for sovereignty or democracy.  They don't understand that nations have to be independent and self-governed.  But this is exactly why they are turning former Remainers into hard Brexiteers.  Now, a number of actual Remain voters, but also regions and areas.  Now, you remember Gibraltar, who basically a lot of people were primarily pro-Remain in 2016 because they were afraid of the whole situation with the borders and with Spain.  Yeah, things are changing again.  Now, for the first time, we've had the principal vice minister of Gibraltar, Joseph Garcia, saying that a no-deal Brexit will be better than a bad agreement.  Basically, Joseph Garcia said that the head minister has already made it clear that an exit without an agreement is better than a bad agreement and Gibraltar must be prepared to leave the negotiating table if it has to.  Yes, well done.  You've turned Gibraltar into a hard Brexit area.  But again, going back to the whole fishing question, because the EU diplomats are concerned that the UK will hold them over a barrel when it comes to fishing.  They've said that there are areas where... the EU has more leverage like market market access and others like fisheries where the UK has more leverage.  so that would mean that they would put us over the barrel and fish and we do the same with them on trade.  I mean good luck with that.  the EU pretend that they have the upper hand when it comes to market access and trade and we have the obviously upper hand when it comes to fisheries.  but actually in reality we'll be fine because we are going to be signing free trade deals with America, South Korea, and various other countries, Norway.  And we'll be fine.  As a country, we'll be fine, even when it comes to trade.  But I don't know how long they can actually survive without having access to our waters.  So it depends how that goes.  We'll be covering all this in the next few weeks and few months.  Now, Barry Gardner.  The Labour leadership election is actually interesting because the whole thing was supposed to be an all-female race because they are obsessed with making sure that the next leader is female.  And then Keir Starmer came out and they were like, oh, okay, fine, a token white male, fine.  And then Clive Lewis came out.  They're like, oh, okay, another one.  And then last night, Barry Gardner, who is, well, at least until last night, he was in the Middle East for some reason, even though Parliament is in session.  Basically, there was this PR stunt when someone leaked, I think Len McCluskey leaked that Barry Gardner is now considering running for leadership.  Barry Gardner initially declined to answer.  And then he said, yeah, I'm actually considering it now.  We knew that was a move.  And we'll see how that ends.  But for people who don't know who Barry Gardner is, just watch this. ",

I mean, surely the Prime Minister told us that that just wasn't going to be the case?  Surely he told the DUP that that wasn't going to be the case?  You mean Prime Minister Johnson may have been lying to us?  Oh no!  Yep, this man could be the next Labour leader.  Well, it's unlikely, but the Labour Party are going through this weird phase after losing the election.  It just looks like they don't want to win.  It's like they want to lose on purpose.  I think they've turned into one of these people who goes through a breakup, they get heartbroken once, and then they say, I'm done with relationships, and then at the same time, they go on dates.  Seriously, it's just too embarrassing to watch.  Get yourself together because they have this new pledge thing where whoever becomes the next leader, they have one or two years to then review and then have another leadership election.  Have some conviction.  It is too embarrassing to watch.  But we'll have to cover it on this channel because it does affect the country in case somehow they win the next election.  So we'll see how it goes.  As you know, we have our Brexit victory rally next Wednesday.  I think we have about 10 tickets left so probably by the time you guys watch this it will be sold out.  but if you want to check out the link in the description we have obviously a number of guests talk radio's Mike Graham the co-founder of the Vote Leave campaign Douglas Carswell and Tory MPs Steve Baker and Nigel Evans plus some surprise guests.  the party will be in London.  we're going to do more of them in the North and the Midlands so don't worry if you can't make it to London But I think we have about 10, 15 tickets left.  So if you want to book now, do it as soon as possible.  And make sure that you subscribe to the channel and click on the bell next to it so you get notified when we release a new video.  I'm Maya Tusi and I'll see you guys tomorrow with a new video. ",
