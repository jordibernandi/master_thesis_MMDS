            "text": "Those who are determined to make believe in the fable that God created every kind of animal on the same day often point to the Cambrian explosion as if that were scientific proof that every animal of Hyla appeared all at once, suddenly and separately, with no evident evolutionary ancestry.  Such believers want to imagine, or at least give you the impression, that all the mammals and birds and reptiles that we see today appeared at the same time as dinosaurs and trilobites and everything else some 6,000 years ago.  And they insist that all the world's best educated expert specialists in geology and paleontology have somehow unanimously misunderstood every type of sedimentation and stratification as well as every method of radiometric dating.  As if everything we can confirm that we actually do know to be true about the geologic column is only an illusion created by a global flood.  A flood that we know couldn't have happened and that we can conclusively show definitely did not happen.  This is something we know for certain.  I have a playlist of videos showing how several different avenues of science have independently disproved the global flood myth of Noah's Ark, so we're not talking about that today, nor the many ways that we can prove that the Earth really is billions of years old.  Instead, we're only talking about what the Cambrian explosion really is, as opposed to what religious extremist science denialists want to pretend that it is.  The first thing that the Cambrian explosion really isn't is an explosion, having occurred in four series, or ten stages, over a geologic period of more than 50 million years, beginning roughly 541 million years ago.  Before radiometric dating told us just how long ago that was, the Cambrian period was given that name in the 1830s by pioneer geologist Adam Sedgwick, who named it after the Welsh country that was then known as Cambria.  The Cambrian Period was the first of a half-dozen geologic periods that make up the Paleozoic Era, which was followed by the Mesozoic Era of the dinosaurs and then the Cenozoic Era of mammals in which we live.  Collectively, all these eras make up the Phanerozoic Eon, being that part of Earth's history in which there was an abundance of complex multicellular organisms.  Geologic history prior to that is known as the Proterozoic Era, which is much more commonly or simply referred to as the Pre-Cambrian, being the time of Proterozoans, before the influx and radiation or diversification of macroscopic life forms.  Understand that for more than 80% of the history of life on Earth, there were only single-celled microbes, some of which cranking out oxygen as a waste product and turning our skies blue.  The influx of oxygen also had an effect on the evolution at the beginning of the Cambrian as well.  And once these organisms were multicellular, there was an unprecedented variety of incidental designs that appeared very quickly, as nature seemed to blindly experiment with every configuration that might work.  And some of those were failed experiments, which is why so many of the things that we know from that time have no living descendants now.  Every geologic period is recognized as containing fossils that are unique to that strata, being multiple collections of species that are found only there and never in any other layer, regardless where in the world they're found.  Thus there are some fossils of Cambrian crustaceans that we recognize as similar to what still exists today, but most animals from back then were already extinct before the next period began, and they're so alien to us now that it's difficult to determine what they even are, or rather, were.  Now, As jungles become deserts or plains become forests, our constantly changing environment means that erosion will be differential.  Some of the layers of the geologic column will be more severely eroded in some regions, being worn thin or wiped away before the ever dynamic environment changes again to allow sedimentation to resume in that area.  There are only a few places where the entire geologic column can be found intact and in one location.  Most of the time the layers will be missing in different places at different levels, but the order that they're in remains constant all over the world.  And that's how we know that the geologic column is real and significant evidence for the evolution of life.  By the 1960s, some people began to refer to the Cambrian period as an explosion in reference to a relatively sudden proliferation of different animal phyla erupting from what had historically been seen as a virtual void, because until that time, no fossils had yet been found before or below Cambrian strata.  In the time of Sedgwick and Darwin, that was a mystery, and it remained a mystery until recent decades, even within my lifetime.  Now, why is that?  First of all, fossilization is rare.  Most of the animals that have ever lived did not end up as fossils.  That only happens under specific circumstances, and good preservation requires even more particular conditions.  So there are hundreds of species representing tens of thousands of individuals each, at the very least, that we might only know about from a fraction of a single fragmented skeleton.  If you find only one unique individual bone, that must mean that there's a skeleton attached to it, right?  And if we have a skeleton at all, there should be more than one because it's more likely than there being just one of anything.  Another reason this is rare is because larger animals fossilize easier than smaller ones.  And we know that the earliest animals were quite small indeed, even microscopic.  I've found microfossils in a microscope just from a handful of dirt that I picked up myself, but they were all of organisms that had shells or bones, which again did not evidently exist prior to the Cambrian period.  The vast majority of fossils are of shells or exoskeletons, and bones appeared in the fossil record later on.  It is possible to find fossils of soft bodies, but the conditions required for that are very particular, and it is even less likely that we'd find something like that that is not already covered in concrete or destroyed by previous people with no understanding of what they had in their hands.  I've seen troughs of thousands of unidentified fossils, fragments too small to tell what they are.  Who knows how many fascinating species have already been discovered but never recognized.  And what we know about evolution tells us that we shouldn't expect to find much of anything prior to the evolution of bones or shells, and that whatever we do find will be trace fossils like tracks or burrows that filled in with later sediments, which we do have, by the way.  Or there's those other situations, those very rare instances where even soft parts of microbes would still be identifiable.  And just because they're rare doesn't mean they don't exist.  And I'm not making excuses for things we haven't yet detected, because we have in fact already found exactly what we expected to find before, meaning below Cambrian strata.  Because of a combination of vastly improved understanding and continuously advancing technology, as well as the discovery of a number of treasure troves of unique fossilization events in remote locations around the world, we've learned more about paleontology just in the last couple of decades than we had in the last couple centuries prior.  In fact, the earliest microfossils found so far are bacteria from 3.8 billion years ago, and fossil protists that date back to just over a billion years old.  So biologists estimate that it took a couple billion years just to get from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and then another billion years or so after that to get to multicellular life.  And what we know about phylogenetic taxonomy, primarily from comparative genomic orthologs, indicates that during the latter billion years, the first eukaryotes in our lineage prompted a symbiotic relationship with mitochondrial bacteria that advanced through the taxonomic ranks of unicorns, apisticons, holozoans, filozoans, and apoicozoans, continuing through what we would now refer to as stem cells before becoming multicellular metazoans.  And that's just to qualify as animals.  Then, as multicellular organisms, they picked up the pace profoundly, continuing on to eventually become bilaterally symmetrical triploblastic deuterostomes.  And we have fossils confirming that all of this happened before the Cambrian period had even begun.  It turns out that the Cambrian was preceded by the Ediacaran period, previously known as the Vendian.  Therein, paleontologists have finally found some of the evolutionary ancestors of the few Cambrian fauna that represent almost everything we still have alive today.  And of course, the most primitive animals are the earliest to arrive, with sponges dating back to 580 million years, perhaps older.  Then, more recently, we see precursors of modern mollusks and soft-bodied forerunners of armored chelocerids like trilobites and scorpions.  So it's not true that every phyla emerged in the Cambrian, because bryozoans like we have today didn't appear until after that period.  Trilobozoans and proarticulates were both Ediacaran phyla that not only appeared before the Cambrian, they were already extinct before the Cambrian too, a fact which serves as evidence against an intelligent designer, or at least against an infallible or omniscient one.  Importantly, we know that there were no primates or familiar fauna like horses or elephants 100 million years ago.  There were no mammals at all 200 million years ago, nor birds either.  And there were no dinosaurs 300 million years ago, and no terrestrial vertebrates of any kind 400 million years ago.  500 million years ago, there weren't even vertebrates with actual bones yet.  The earliest and most primitive fish evidently didn't exist until at least 10 million years into the Cambrian.  So it seems that our lineage living through that time somehow never noticed that so-called explosion.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
