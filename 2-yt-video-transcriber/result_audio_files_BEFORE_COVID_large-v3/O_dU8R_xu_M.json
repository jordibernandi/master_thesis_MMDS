So, on the issue of race, I couldn't agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly.  I\u2014there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a coworker, who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination.  Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she\u2014because we were black.  And I will say also that in this campaign, we have also heard\u2014and I'm going to now direct this at Vice President Biden\u2014I do not believe you are a racist.  And I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.  But I also believe\u2014and it's personal, and I was actually very\u2014it was hurtful.  to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.  And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.  And there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools.  And she was bused to school every day.  And that little girl was me.  So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats.  We have to take it seriously.  We have to act swiftly.  As Attorney General of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on.  Senator Harris, thank you. ",
