This particular blacklist is showing which news sites aren't going to show up underneath the search bar when people are searching on their Android phones.  And what they're doing is that they're saying, okay, well, you know, News Busters, the Gateway Pundits, National Enquirer, Media Matters, Info Wars, they're not going to appear on their search results.  And they're telling people that, oh, they don't have any blacklist.  This is all done.  They don't have any political ideology.  They don't have any political bias.  But it's really clear that they do.  And if Google wants to have political bias and they want to say that they've got political bias, you know, that is their right as a company.  But for them to go under oath and say that these blacklists don't exist while employees like me are able to just search through the internal search engine of the company and see that they do is hypocritical at the least.  And it's perjury at the worst. ",

Okay, and so I had every incentive in the world to stay at the company and just collect the paycheck.  And I know that that's the decision most other people would make, which is to just to collect the paycheck.  But I could never live with myself knowing that if Google was able to implement the plans that they were planning, that I, at the moment of choice, backed out because I was selfish.  And I didn't want to have that on my conscious.  And I felt guilty.  And people are like, well, you're brave.  It's like the feeling that I participated in what they were doing was actually worse.  I feel that when I'm coming and explaining what Google was doing, this is an act of atonement to make my conscious clear.  And if I didn't do this, then I'd have to live with myself for the rest of my life.  and people aren't gonna understand what I'm talking about until they see the documents because it's really that bad.  You know, they can stop like one or two of us, but they can't stop all of us coming out and explaining to the American public that this is what's happening, that Google is not who they say they are.  I've been living with this like burden for three years since 2016 when they started changing everything.  And, you know, and to have that burden lifted off of my soul is... I've never felt happier or more at peace with myself than I have right now. ",

They've long given up their investigative mandates.  And they're not, you know, the legitimate news is coming from the ground up.  And they're at this point just picking it, you know.  But the real news is made by outlets like Project Veritas that does real investigative journalism and has, you know, ethics and morality and wants to see America thrive.  I don't think a lot of these other news organizations actually want to see America thrive.  I think they want to see it fall.  And so I knew that I could trust you.  And honestly, the reason why Project Veritas has so much credibility is because of you, James, because you have the moral fortitude to stand behind this.
