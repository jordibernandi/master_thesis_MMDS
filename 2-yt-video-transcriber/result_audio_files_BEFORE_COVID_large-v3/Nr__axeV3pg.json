            "text": "This is Terry Suit of Suits Entertainment Vids.  I wanted to talk about the allegations against Afrika Bambaataa.  Now if you look at the history of rap music, the history of hip-hop, Afrika Bambaataa is one of the pioneers of hip-hop.  He's one of the founding fathers of And for a lot of you younger folks who may not realize is that rap music started during the mid-1970s, and it started with DJs like T.J.  Kirk, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash.  These are the three founding fathers of hip hop.  Now, there's three men who have accused Afrika Bambaataa of sexual assault.  They say that Afrika Bambaataa sexually assaulted them when they were kids.  Hussain Campbell, Ron Savage, and another man also accused them.  Now, he's been kicked out of the Zulu Nation.  Afrika Bambaataa started this Zulu Nation during the 1980s.  This is an organization that he started And the Zulu Nation has kicked him out of the organization because even members in the organization say they've seen Afrika Bambaataa molesting young black boys.  So I don't know if this is true or not.  He denies all the allegations.  But why would three men, three grown men, come out and say that they've been molested?  I think the allegations are true.  And when you look at some of Hussein Campbell's videos, you can tell he's struggling living with this, knowing that he got molested by African Bambada.  Now, I've never been molested before in my life.  But if you ever speak to somebody who's been molested, it lives with them for the rest of their lives.  Hussein Campbell said he was molested when he was 12 years old by Afrika Bebada.  And you can tell when he talks about this, it hurts him.  It hurts him to talk about it.  And he's still psychologically trying to deal with this as a grown man.  So when I see a lot of these ignorant people on social media making fun of Hussein Campbell, I just think these people are ignorant.  If you've never been molested before, you don't know what this feels like.  You don't know how much of a psychological damaging influence this does on young boys, on kids in general.  I believe Hussein Campbell is telling the truth.  I believe Ron Savage is telling the truth.  I saw an interview with Ron Savage where he was talking about how when he was a kid, he was molested by Afrika Bambaataa And he was in tears.  He was crying during the whole interview.  I believe this man, he led a secret lifestyle.  To the public, he was a pioneer.  He was a founding father of hip-hop.  But in private, he was a predator.  In private, he was a sexual predator that abused young boys.  And these young boys are all grown up and they're still living with this damage that he did to them.  So I think a lot of people need to wake up and realize that this is not a joke.  This is not a game.  Any person that molested his children deserves to be, he deserves to go to prison.  But because of the statute of limitations in New York, they're not going to charge him with anything.  There's like a 10-year statute of limitations in New York.  So if somebody sexually assaulted someone more than 10 years ago, there can't be charges brought against him.  But they still can sue him.  They can still sue Afrika Bambaataa.  So hopefully that happens.  But I believe these young men are telling the truth.  I believe Afrika Bambaataa led a secret lifestyle.  And I think this is why the Zulu Nation kicked him out of the Zulu Nation.  Now, over the last five years, there's been a lot of famous black men that have been accused of sexually assaulting people.  We had Bill Cosby, we had R. Kelly, and now we have Afrika Bambaataa.  Now, usually when somebody gets accused of something, I will say the person should be innocent until proven guilty.  But in this particular case, you have people within the Zulu nation who are accusing Afrika Bambaataa of molesting boys.  And because of the statute of limitations, he can't be charged with anything.  So these charges, I mean, these allegations are never going to go to trial.  This is why I believe he's guilty.  He may not be charged with anything.  He may never go to prison.  But this man clearly has a track record of messing with young boys.  But even after all he's been accused of, I still don't think it takes away what he's done as a musician.  There's a lot of great musicians in the history of music that have been accused of doing heinous things.  It still doesn't take away what they accomplished.
