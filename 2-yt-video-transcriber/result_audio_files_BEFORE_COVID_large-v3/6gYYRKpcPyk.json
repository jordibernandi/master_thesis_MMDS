            "text": "Because I'm a glutton for punishment, I am going to revisit the article, The Dangerous Rise of Men Who Won't Date Woke Women by Vicky Spratt over at Refinery29.  You see, I've often done these videos talking about sexual marketplaces and human mating and dating and things like that.  There was a series of articles about how women who are in their early 30s and had jobs were struggling to find men who made as much money as they did.  And to wrap that up, it's basically because men tend to date younger.  Men also want to feel like providers too, but men tend to date younger.  So if you're going to ask a guy who's 30 years old, who's now got a job, you know, he's making money.  He's got a car.  He's going to try and date on Tinder.  It's going to skew younger.  And these younger women are going to be like, Hey, this guy's got a car.  We can go do stuff.  All right, let's get out of here.  Refinery29.  This brings me to this article.  It's a blog about why these women are so scared that men won't date.  woke women.  And it's actually, I got to say, this article is a bit confusing because it's overly verbose and kind of misses key points.  I'm not trying to be mean to Yash AF on Twitter.  I'm not, Jacob Falkovich.  It's a good article, but I'm reading through it like it's.  It kind of gets to the point where they're about to explain the idea and then it skips over.  But let me just break it down for you.  First, let me say, I get a bunch of flack from feminists whenever I make videos about this stuff, because apparently they don't want to hear it.  But it's very, very simple why women are scared, why it's dangerous that men won't date woke women.  It's because woke women who can't find men are who do want men, will have to change their politics to become more attractive.  And there we go.  So what's actually truly fascinating about this, we can go through the whole thing, and I'll come back and we'll read some of this.  is when he gets to the issue of Emma Sulkowicz.  Now, this to me was absolutely fascinating.  And I did not know this.  It happened in October.  So let me scroll down.  You can see how long this is.  You may remember Emma Sulkowicz.  She's Mattress Girl.  If you're not familiar with the story, she hooked up with a dude, accused him of, you know, assault.  He ended up winning because it wasn't assault.  She then went and carried around her mattress throughout the school.  She was featured on magazines.  Lo and behold, what is going on with Emma Sulkowicz today?  Well, apparently she's red pilled, I guess.  Check this article out.  from the cut.  Did Emma Sulkowicz get red pilled?  At the very least, she's found a new social set.  Lo and behold, in the article, they talk about how she's reading Jordan Peterson.  It says this.  The affair put Sulkowicz in an interesting position.  On one hand, an inspiration for women survivors of assault and a symbol of believe all women.  On the other hand, a reputation that is likely quite intimidating to potential sexual partners, even of the most progressive sort.  And so five years after she picked up the mattress, Sulkowicz is, quote, attending house parties and happy hours with conservative and libertarian intellectuals, reading Jordan Peterson and articles from the National Review.  She talks about the importance of understanding a variety of political attitudes, of listening with an open mind.  What triggered this change in attitude?  In Emma's own words, quote, the story starts with me being on Tinder.  He was very bland, very blonde, law school, cut jawline, trapezoidal body figure, tweed suit kind of vibe.  But something inside of me made me swipe right.  I don't know.  He says, art, humor, altruism, ideology, everything we do is guided by our psychology and our psychology evolved by sexual selection.  And so everything we do is driven by the desire for reproduction, apart from actually publishing psychology papers.  Ha ha ha, I think he's making a joke.  It's often not the immediate cause of our actions, but it's always in the back of our brains and in the chains of cause and effect guiding us.  Something inside us, as Ms.  Sulkowicz says, and what our brains sense that our behavior, such as an adherence to a political ideology, is costing us the mating domain, it's cause for internal conflict.  And that brings me back to the original article, the one that was mocked by so many people, the dangerous rise of men who won't date woke women.  According to this article, Vicky Spratt, who, let me actually pull this up and read what he says.  Let me see this.  Does he mention where she's single?  Let me search for single and see if we can pull this up.  They say, Ms.  Spratt, the author of the article about men who won't date woke, is 31 and single and, quote, grateful to be financially independent and living in a time where it's acknowledged that you're better off on your own for a while than trapped in an unhappy relationship.  So that is the third option, going your own way while writing articles about the men who keep out of your mating market.  He says, So I'll stop there.  I'll make the point.  Here's what I see.  When you realize Emma Sulkowicz has basically flipped, she saw a hot and sexy man on Tinder and she swiped right.  Lo and behold, that man was, well, I don't know if he was, but she eventually found herself attracted to these men who happened to be conservative or libertarian.  Unfortunately, the ideas she espoused were a net negative in mating.  So if humans are mostly driven about sexual desire, then whether you look attractive or are mentally attractive, you must be the most attractive possible.  In the end, we see a story about a woman who was as woke as they come, at least as the media propped her up, who's now reading, you know, watching Jordan Peterson lectures and hanging out with conservatives and libertarians.  I did not know that.  And they even ask if she's been red pilled.  Well, I'll tell you what.  If men won't date woke, then the first thing we get, sour grapes.  You know the story of sour grapes?  What is it, the old parable about the fox or whatever?  And he sees the grapes up all high and he's like, ooh, juicy grapes.  And he jumps and jumps, can't get them.  And then he goes, you know what?  Those grapes were sour anyway.  And he walks away.  Well, this article, I would imagine, was written because she felt that anger.  Why won't these men date me?  So angry.  She says a story about a celebrity who says, I'm not dating those woke women.  She got mad.  So she calls it dangerous.  Literal sour grapes.  There is a danger to the woke ideology that men won't date them.  Now, she doesn't really bring it up.  The real danger is that women who want boyfriends, who want mates, when they confront the idea that most guys in the moderate or in the conservative side will not date them, their only option is to abandon that ideology.  But here's the reality.  Many of them won't actively say, my only choice is to abandon the ideology.  Many of them will just naturally drift away from it when they realize they are being ostracized.  In the inverse, what do we see?  You ever wonder why it's so many male feminists end up being abusers?  They are drifting towards that ideology because they're hoping to get laid.  But what happens when that ideology clashes with what the feminists actually want?  They become abusive because they did it for one reason, to get laid.  And when those women wouldn't do it because they're feminists, the men who just wanted it, these male feminists, they go all out.  They go nuts.  They become violent.  That's why there are so many of them.  The other side is to just change.  And you end up seeing the infamous mattress girl become red pilled.  This blew my mind.  I swear I didn't even know this happened.  I would have loved to have done a video about this when it did happen.  But October 28th, 2019, this symbol of wokeness, the cover of what Time magazine or whatever, carrying the mattress, believe all women, now is red pilled.  That's crazy.  So here's what we end up seeing.  Curious.  I wonder if there are men who say they won't date conservative.  You don't really see it.  I mean, I haven't heard that, right?  Is there any guy who's going around talking about how they wouldn't hook up with a conservative chick?  I really doubt it.  Men don't seem to be all that picky for the most part.  So think about it this way.  With women, they're particularly picky.  With men, they're like, I'll take what I can get, except when it comes to wokeness.  That's what we're starting to see.  I think it's fair to say there are certain guys that'll go for anything.  But when it comes to the abrasiveness of the woke ideology, it's really off-putting.  But more importantly, these women have an ideology that is so far at odds, or I should probably say, makes you feel so bad, you don't want to be involved with it.  You could probably say something similar to, you know, diehard religious folk.  The issue is the wokeness is becoming profound and very prominent in media.  So in the end, you end up with a bunch of women who express their views, talk about it overtly in these articles, and it creates a very, I guess, an awareness of this kind of fringe belief.  But I'll come back to this one point, and I'll try to keep it short, I suppose.  When I see this article about the dangerous rise of men who won't date woke women, what I really think, my assumption, is that the only reason you'd call it dangerous is if you felt something visceral inside of you.  You understood the experience of meeting a man who found out, like maybe you swiped right on that attractive tweed jacket blonde guy with a cut jawline.  And you met him, said a bunch of dumb woke things, and he was like, I'm not interested.  And all of a sudden you felt bad.  the first reaction won't be to abandon your ideology.  It will say, yeah, well, you're dangerous anyway.  You're far right.  But eventually, you'll realize your selection opportunities have dwindled.  And many of these women, whether they realize it or not, will eventually start drifting away from the ideology because it's detrimental to social life.  Humans being social creatures don't want to be around this stuff.  But you know what?  I could probably do a much longer video on this at another point.  These videos are usually short, so I'll wrap it up there.  Bring on the outrage.  I don't care.  You can comment, say whatever you want.  I will see you all tomorrow at 10 a.m Thanks for hanging out.  Podcast at 6.30.  I will see you all next time. ",
