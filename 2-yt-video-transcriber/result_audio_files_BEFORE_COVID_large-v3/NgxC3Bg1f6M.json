And the swine, though he divide the hoof and be cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud, he is unclean to you.  Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch.  They are unclean to you.  World Master.  World Master.  For behold, the Lord will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire.  For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many.  They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh and the abomination and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.  Yes, it is.  So you're the one behind all this. ",
