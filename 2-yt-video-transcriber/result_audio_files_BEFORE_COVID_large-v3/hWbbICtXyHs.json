            "text": "Do you know Nikki Cox?  Yeah.  She's still with Jay?  She's with Jay Moore.  Yeah, yeah.  But when she was on my TV show, she was with Bobcat Goldthwait.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I'm not a skilled interviewer.  Let's talk basic.  I'm not a skilled... What do you think is wrong-er?  Wrong.  More wrong.  What do you think is more wrong?  Having sex with a child, a human being, or an adult pig?  Like, you've got to do one.  That's the options.  You've got to do one, yeah.  You're on a deserted island.  But do you actually think that they would like a man's sperm?  A human... A human being's sperm?  A woman's?  Well, who?  A woman.  A woman would like a man's... Well, yeah, she's been biologically programmed for millennia.  In her mouth?  But in your mouth, like, isn't that stuff, like, living?  Isn't that, like, aren't those animals, little tiny tadpoles or something?  I didn't know it was going to have to get this deep.  All right, then.  Are you doing this to be a funny thing, or do you really have to kind of feel?  No, I feel that I have an oral fixation.  You know about that.  I don't have that, by the way.  I don't like sucking cock.  You don't like sucking cock?  I don't like sucking cock.  I mean, I have done it.  Yeah, I wouldn't like it.  You know why I wouldn't like it?  Why?  Aren't those animals inside the cum?  The sperm you mean?  Yeah.  So to me, it's a bunch of animals and stuff.  But you remind me of a guy that's good at fucking.  I love it.  Fucking and sucking.  Let's say you had an exact twin.  Now, Mary Willard, your wife... Oh, here we go.  There could be a lot of... Wouldn't you go like, how do you not find him attractive?  Do you know what I mean?  That's true.  He looks exactly like me.  Yeah.  And he's much better at sucking and fucking.  No, no.  No, no.  I only smoke a pot four times a week.  You're just saying it casually.  They're like, you smoke more than that.  Like, relax.  What are you afraid?  I'm not admitting I'm like you.  Four times a week seems like a lot to me.  I smoke... Does it really?  A little, yeah.  Well, it's all relative.  It's all relative.  As long as it's not hurting anybody.  As long as it's not hurting anybody, but what about the audience, the stand-up audience?  Aren't they the real victims?  What's your dream view?  The show, the view?  Yeah.  The guests?  What four or five ladies would you want in there?  Ooh, that's a great question.  Susan Yagler.  That's your wife.  You didn't even recognize her name.  It's your betrothed.  My betrothed.  I was, I had moved up from San Diego.  Uh-huh.  I was like, come, move up.  And then I had no place to live.  Uh-huh.  So I slept in my truck for like three nights.  And I slept at the parking lot at the comedy store.  And I had no money and I was broke.  Both?  Yeah.  you hungry?  I go, yeah.  Like a baby bird.  So you said, yeah.  Yeah, I go, yeah, and he took me to... Am I hungry?  I'm broke and I have no money.  What do you think?  I'm hungry.  I'm hungry, plus I want some food.  Do you feel you have white privilege?  I'm not allowed to answer those questions.  Being an old white guy with extra money.  Your great special that's on Netflix now, everybody should watch, is called... straight white male.  sixty young people won't like old people.  when i was a kid i got involved with al jolson when they brought i don't know who he was.  no no not back in the nineteen twenties.  i was just a kid when the jazz singer came out charlie fox.  he wrote uh the theme music to uh happy days the love boat.  yeah he wrote just about everything.  he must make a heck of a lot of money i want.  i'm going to ask him something how much do you make say to that what i say?  what would norman lear say to that?  who's that?  and now the whole set went quiet in the year.  people went.  santa just said And all these kids froze, and then they had a Disney guy, he said, fuk, fuk, it's a Swedish word, means take a break.  We're supposed to take a break.  So he thought when you said take a break, Then I would go, speaking of taking a break, David Letterman.  Apparently, he's going to do this show.  Really?  Oh, my gosh.  That would be amazing.  And every actual talk show host will kill himself.  I love Mary Tyler Moore.  And I know you were on her TV program.  And then when she was your guest, there was this incredible chemistry.  And was there ever anything romantic with her?  I mean, she must have been.  She must have been very desirable to you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, it was good.  But what is the question?  I mean, was... The question is, did you have, you know, did you ever lay down on top of her, I guess?  No, not that.  Now, wait a minute.  You bring up a good point, Norm.  The first one of the day.  Now, you have a show for 33 years.  You know, every day, you know, you do that every day.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, so the show ends.  And then that night, what do you think?  You think about tomorrow's show?  Uh... No.  It's funny because, as you must know, the human neuromuscular skeletal system is easily programmed.  And after two or three... I'm sure I knew that.  As soon as you said that first word.  Now, you're sort of a technical master of jokes.  I love jokes, and I love to disassemble and assemble them, yes.  Right, and now also with sitcoms, you're able to solve that haiku also.  After a while, we figured out what worked on our show, yes.  And have you ever considered publishing a book that tells all that how-to book?  No, but I have considered... some way to pass along what I have accumulated.  I don't really know how to do it.  Do you have any ideas?  Perhaps you could executive produce a show with Sebastian Mankow as the star.  I could do that.  Yeah.  And, uh, and, uh... Well, what fun is that, though?  Where's the fun part for me?  Oh, no, there's no fun for you.  There's no fun for me.  No, that's true.  But what's the fun for you in giving a homeless guy a spray and a handful of quarters and watching him dodge in and out of traffic?  I am firmly on the side of womanhood now, but I am not a woman, nor will I ever be.  Three sentences later, I use the woman's restroom because I am a woman.  I change my gender.  I'm a versatility female because I am a woman.  So there's a little confusion there, right?  Not for me.  What's wrong with that?  So there's no bars like.  the same way as there were gay bars when gays were... I couldn't go there?  Well, of course not.  Can't you see that?  I forgot.  Yeah, you and me hanging out at the trans bar.  I just don't, you know, I don't think it's going to work.  Nowadays we can't.  Oh, yeah, well, that's true.  Yeah, that's true.  Wait, I haven't come out yet.  I always get anxious when I'm on a plane and I see a much bigger celebrity than me.  And I think if this goes down, I'm going to be like small print almost every flight.  All right.  We'll be back in a second.  Unfortunately, the radio station launched the day after Princess Diana died.  So it was quite, it wasn't quite the sort of fanfare and celebration.  Bit like when Farah Fawcett died and then he was usurped.  But the Queen murdered her.  Yes, she did.  Yes, that's well known in England, yeah.  I'd like to apologize to the Queen.  England's not doing well financially.  Right.  Can't you get a, you call them your mates?  Mm-hmm.  They're friends.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody else in the world.  They call them mates.  Sure.  Get a couple of dozen of your mates and go down to that Buckingham Palace and kill the old bag.  To what end?  It's money.  Are you an old sea captain?  What is this shtick that you... Because I'm pretty sure I've watched some of these other editions of the show, and I'm pleased to see that I've broken from the rule of only having white blokes on the show, which seems to be... You only have white men and Roseanne.  Because it's supposed to be a comedy.  Right, right, right.  It's supposed to be.  It's allegedly.  I still, you know, feel that... I still feel in my heart, you know, and I can only go by my heart, you know what I mean?  I'm not a person that goes by my brain.  I just go by my heart.  That Bill Hader is ultimately unknowable.  Yes, that's true.  What do you think?  I don't know.  Okay. ",
