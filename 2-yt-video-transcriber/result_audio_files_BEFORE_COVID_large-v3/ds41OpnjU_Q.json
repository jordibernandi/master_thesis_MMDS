And he knew that both of those would be catastrophic occurrences, but at least more profoundly that the death of the idea of a universe ordered by something that's akin to the living and conscious and aware and intelligent.  So it's rough to replace that with pure random meaninglessness.  And of course, that's the pathway to nihilism.
