Other than that I can form words without a mouth.  Oh, and speaking of my beautiful, mouthless, masked face, I'm bringing filmed videos back soon.  I know I said in my update video that I might film one or two a month and I wasn't going to make any promises, but I've been thinking hard, I've been getting excited, and I've made some decisions about how I want to use my space after we move.  And I've decided I want to go back to filming my videos from now on.  My Patreon earnings are still way below the goal for filmed videos that they used to be over, but whatever.  I wanna do it, I like the expressiveness that it brings to my videos, and thanks to finally having a dedicated workspace soon, it's gonna become feasible to film again, not too long from now.  Now, I'm making this video in November, I don't know when I'm gonna publish it.  Uh, the videos I make in December also will not be filmed, because we're gonna be busy with the move, but hopefully in January, maybe mid-January, we'll finally be settled enough, the studio will be set up, and I can start filming.  If you've been missing the filmed videos hoping they'll come back, I hope you'll consider pledging like two bucks on Patreon or Subscribestar, just to help bring the value of that extra time investment back up to the level where it used to be at, or at least closer.  Those two bucks will get you the earliest possible access to every single video.  Now, even though we're not even close to that Patreon goal, I'm still gonna film no matter what.  Even after I dropped below that goal last year, I filmed for months afterwards, and the only time I stopped was when it became no longer feasible to film in the condo.  That's not gonna be the case anymore in the house.  I'll actually have the space and the peace and everything to do it.  So I'm using the opportunity to make my videos the way I actually want them to be, the way I wish they could have been all along, that just stopped making any sense at a certain point.  But while that personal satisfaction is nice, and I'm sure I'll feel good about it, it would be kinda cool to get more than just good feels for the pretty major amount of extra work.  I think a lot of people out there really like the filmed videos, at least better than the cartoon Avatar.  I think it gives my work more personality, so it'd be kinda super cool if you'd think about it.  Anyway, Theophilus.  Sorry for the tangent, so the second C is that God made the creation.  Let's start a list.  Hallelujah.  Right, yeah, I understand that that's the claim, but the C in 10 C's I don't believe stands for claim, does it?  It stands for caproof. ",

I mean, it's probably a somewhat compelling, if really slimy, way to guilt someone who's just stopped believing.  But as someone who never believed, man is it ever funny.  I'm gonna tell you why you think what you think, and then you proceed to ramble on about shit that's literally never applied to me at all.  The total inability of some Christians to put themselves in someone else's shoes, to accurately pinpoint any of my beliefs or reasons or motivations really does not help their conversion attempts very much.  In fact, in my case, their insistence on telling people what they think like they're some kind of psychics, instead of just asking what I think and then talking about it, has always been more than a little bit counterproductive.  How am I supposed to believe you out of everyone have the great secret to life the universe and everything when you pretend to know what's in my head and get everything wrong? ",
