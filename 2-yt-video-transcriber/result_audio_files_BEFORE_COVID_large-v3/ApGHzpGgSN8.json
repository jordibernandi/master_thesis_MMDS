And he likes Bernie Sanders, and he decided that he was going to take his considerable editing skills, and he was going to make the most awesome Bernie Sanders ad you've ever seen in your life.  Now, this ad is great not just because it shows how Bernie's been fighting for regular people, I mean, his whole career.  This ad is also great because it really, really, really exposes corporate media bias against him.  It uses juxtaposition beautifully.  So you can see what Bernie's actually doing and what he's actually fighting for versus what a lot of overpaid hacks are telling you about him.  So without further ado, let's take a look and then we'll discuss. ",

If you don't mind, just do me a favor, click through to that video, hit the like button, drop in on the original video, give it a like, and share it as much as possible.  Now, I tweeted this out.  Somebody tweeted it at me.  I wish I could remember who it was because I'd like to give them credit.  But somebody tweeted this at me.  I saw it, watched it, immediately shared it, was floored by how good the ad is.  And then Sean King, who follows me, saw the ad as well.  And then he... Took the ad, I saw him like and maybe retweet, but it could have been just like my tweet on it.  And then what he did is he uploaded it to Twitter itself.  And he credited, you know, Orf at ZeroRF who created the video.  And he said, wow, what a great ad.  And so he uploaded it to Twitter.  I had just shared the YouTube link, okay, but he uploaded it to Twitter.  You ready for this?  How many views did it get?  And this is as of yesterday.  It could have gone up way more by now.  But as of yesterday, it had 5 million views.  On Twitter alone.  On Twitter alone.  Now, when I saw his video on YouTube, it had about 8,000 views.  And then I kept going back and checking it.  Last time I checked, which was early yesterday, it'll be higher than that now.  Last time I checked early yesterday, it was about 135,000 views on YouTube.  His original video.  So listen, this is spreading like wildfire.  Why is it spreading like wildfire?  Because it's powerful, and it's poignant, and it's correct, and it's true.  And he's incredibly talented, and he did a wonderful job making this ad.  When I watch that, I think, we can win this thing.  We can definitely win this thing.  There's a reason why this show has grown so much over the years.  And it's not necessarily because I'm so good at my job.  It's because they're so bad at their job.  They mean in corporate media.  I mean, they're really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad.  Really bad.  Really bad.  And you'll notice something.  And this feeds into something I've been saying for a long time.  I always said, you know, my main arguments that I like to make are policy-based arguments.  And what you saw there is what?  All those hosts who were going after Bernie?  It was always personality arguments.  Characteristic arguments.  You know, I don't like him.  He seems pushy and shouty.  He's unlikable.  He's disheveled.  Who cares?  Who cares what you think of him personally?  Who cares about that?  I mean, you could find people who, I mean, frickin' Ellen DeGeneres was just at a baseball game with George W. Bush.  Now, I'm sure she'd say, oh, he's very likable.  He's actually not disheveled at all and not pushy and shouty at all.  Yeah, but he also happens to be a war criminal.  He also happens to be one of the worst presidents in U.S.  history.  So I don't care about your character analysis.  Why should I care what you random person on TV, who I know nothing about, why should I care what you have to say about this guy, when really the thing that I'm voting for a politician based on is their proposed policies, their record, and their strategy moving forward in order to try to get said policies implemented.  Why should I care about your, you know, I don't think you should lead anybody, he's disheveled, he's pushy, he's unlikable.  By the way, some of the people who are commenting there, like Jennifer Rubin, she's a Republican.  I mean, you never see this work in the reverse direction.  They never invite me on to concern troll the Republican Party and say, you know, I don't know, I think you guys are going too far in this direction.  Why?  Because it's viewed on its face as absurd because I'm not a Republican.  So why would I be in a position like, oh, let me tell you the direction you guys should go in.  Why would anybody listen to me?  I mean, that's ridiculous.  Why would you ask the opposition to criticize you and then you adopt the ideas of your opposition?  No.  I mean, that's like Jennifer Rubin.  You want to criticize somebody, go criticize the Republicans.  Like, that's your party.  We're supposed to take seriously these concern trolls of like, I don't know about this Bernie Sanders fella.  Well, that's wonderful.  How about you hop on the bus and go to Shut the Fuck Upsville because I'm not dealing with it because you're not even in our party.  How about Bernie Sanders should listen much more, as he does, by the way, to the Democratic base.  and to independents and to all these groups that have historically been on the sidelines and been marginalized.  You know, we can build a winning coalition, man.  We need a multiracial, multibackground coalition of working class people.  And we can win this thing.  And I'm sorry, but there's one candidate that's willing to fight this hard and who's right on this many issues.  And his name's Bernie Sanders.  Now, don't get me wrong.  If you're not, if you simply don't believe in a social democratic or democratic socialist vision, okay, if you're in the minority of americans because most americans actually do agree with this agenda whether they know it or not but if you're in that small group that doesn't you know support this ideology it's fine to not support him that's fine.  go right ahead.  but if people were voting based off their best interests it's not even a question like these.  things are empirically judged.  you can look at polling data which shows that his agenda that he's fighting for is massively popular.  most of the things he's pushing for are over 60 percent favorability rating Never mind over 50, which would be strong enough.  Most of the things are over 60% favorability rating.  And this guy has been dealing with, you want to talk about fake news.  Okay, Trump can whine all he wants, but you know what he does?  He only trots that out when it's any story that's against him.  Even if that story is true, he'll scream fake news because he's a self-serving moron.  But with Bernie Sanders, this is the real fake news.  It's against Bernie Sanders.  The real fake news is glossing over his wildly popular agenda and his wildly successful record in order to act like.  he's not a serious person when you see the hard work he's been doing.  One of the moments that pissed me off the most there is when one of them was like, he's done nothing over the past few years.  Are you kidding me?  He's been building this grassroots behemoth and doing rallies all over the place and marching with working people, with unions, going to Canada to get cheaper insulin with people who need it.  Did you know in the U.S.  a vial of insulin could go for $360?  And it's like, I forget the exact number, but it's like a fraction of that in Canada.  A fraction of that.  And it only costs like a couple dollars to make.  But, you know, we're getting screwed over in this country because big pharma is screwing us.  Who do you really trust to take on the pharmaceutical companies?  How about the person who's been fighting them his entire career?  Who do you trust to take on the for-profit health insurance companies?  How about the person who's been fighting them and fighting for Medicare for all all these years?  Who do you trust to take on Wall Street?  Who do you trust to take on the military industrial complex?  Who do you trust to take on all of the people who are screwing you?  I mean, the answer is straightforward and very simple.  So, it's Bernie Sanders all day long.  So, again, what a wonderful ad.  Matt, that was incredible.  Already 5 million views on Twitter, over 100,000 on YouTube.  This video as well is going to add, I don't know, maybe 100,000 more or so.  Spread this thing as far as possible, man.  I saw there was one tweet that made my day about this.  Somebody said, I was for another candidate, and then I watched this video.  Now I'm voting for Bernie 2020.  Because what they recognized is, oh, he has not, by any stretch of the imagination, gotten fair coverage.  And when you look at what he's actually been doing, what he's actually been fighting for, what his record is, what his proposed policies are, nobody comes close. ",
