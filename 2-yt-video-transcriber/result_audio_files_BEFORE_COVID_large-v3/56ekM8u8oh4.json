And so you're welcome to read it there if you want the fuller version.  But I mean, basically, there were some things that occurred.  The main thing I think that changed my head was reading about how the Bible was produced, right?  So when I started looking up, I realized at a point that I was talking to a friend of mine in college, and he was also a theist, but he was not a Christian.  And he brought up to me some things about the production of the Bible.  that just sounded a little weird.  And then I started hearing about apocryphal texts from some of my other friends.  And I finally just thought, none of this sounds like what I was taught in the Josh McDowell apologetics course.  And I also started thinking it seemed really weird to me.  I don't know how familiar you are with Church of Christ, but it's kind of like just rite of baptism.  And so they are like super Bible-believing, right?  Like they promote the church as like literal biblical church.  And I thought it's a little strange now that people are asking me about it that I don't know anything about the history of the Bible.  Right.  Like I know the Bible content stories, but I don't know anything about how this book came to exist.  And that seemed real weird to me because I was going to a church that said this book is the word of God.  And I was like, shouldn't we be having lots of lessons on all about the Bible?  Like learning everything about the Bible?  Like how it came to be?  Who collected the letters?  How did they pick what went in and what didn't go in?  And I realized I didn't know anything about that.  And I thought it was real strange because it seemed like something the church person should know.  And because that hit me as really odd, I was like, I need to go see what's the story here.  Because in all my years of going to church, I'd never had a class on that topic.  And so I went and I started looking up how the Bible got put together.  And the more I read, the more I was like, oh, my.  Right?  Like this is not what I expected at all.  And by the time I got to the end of that story, I was just like, okay, so this is just a book.  Yeah.  And it sort of wrecked the Bible for me as far as being the Word of God.  I shook that pretty much after what I read.  And then when I went to my pastor and I said, hey, just letting you know, I read some stuff and you might want to know about it because this is way different than what we're preaching and we've never really studied it.  So I don't know if you even know about it, but here's some stuff and I've got. ",
