            "text": "Some of you may remember, all the way back in 2004, one of Tony Blair's former aides, one Robert Winder, as having referred to the British Isles and the people therein as, quote, having always been a mongrel nation.  It was this ship of Theseus-style reasoning which became one of the most significant pretexts for explaining away the biblical levels of immigration into the country.  We are all immigrants, he said.  It simply depends how far back you go.  In other words, since there was nothing new about immigration, there was nothing out of the ordinary about what was happening.  Thus, not only should it not be a source of concern, but it ought to be a phenomenon welcomed.  Naturally, scant logic was brought forth to explain the shared lineage between the stock of A.E.  Hausman and Saudi Arabian exile Omar Bakri Mohammed.  Although these writings have long since been forgotten, they really were some of the most significant justifications for coaxing an uneasy public into nervous acquiescence, and even now, this expression mongrel nation captures so perfectly the 21st century phenomenon of what in this video I will refer to as replacism.  That is, the phenomenon of, in the words of the German poet Bertolt Brecht, dissolving a people and re-electing another.  Contrary to left-wing opinion, the rising curiosity in the philosophy of replacism does not come from the dregs of the internet, but entered the mainstream consciousness when it was codified as official policy, as released by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, Replacement Migration.  What are the alarm bells here?  It is the presupposition that there is such a thing as one human nature for all time.  And herein lies the great new totalitarianism.  The new dawn of a new man, engineered by the socialist master builder.  A common misconception about the character of totalitarianism is that it strives for despotic rule over man.  In truth, its aim is more specific.  What it ideally seeks is a system wherein men become superfluous, that is, non-essential, or, to borrow Newspeak from Orwell, overmuch.  What we know of history tells us this kind of power can only be achieved in a world of conditioned reflexes.  What would a world of conditioned reflexes look like?  The human specimen reduced to the most elementary action.  The NPC is not dissimilar to what Arendt calls a marionette, men who all react with perfect reliability even when going to their own death, and which do nothing but react.  The marionette is a model citizen for a system based on replacism.  Because, whilst to be uprooted means to have no place in the world, to be superfluous means not to belong to the world at all.  We might think of it as a kind of human inflation.  This step typically begins with the neutralising demotion from men into masses.  A demotion camouflaged in the lofty status of citizen of the world.  As Shelley once said in his socialist days, man, not men.  And I've started to wonder whether this is in fact the reason that social justice is so enamoured with the trans scene.  Because here, any question of fixed or binding human essence is subverted.  It's one of the rare areas of civic life that permits staple categorisation to be frustrated.  Really, what language could be more compelling to an internationalist despot than the language of fluidity?  Language of the indistinct, indiscernible, and therefore interchangeable?  After all, is trans not a prefix for transition, transformation, transfer?  It is not for the well-being of a suffering identity that the progressive lobby bleeds for.  but in the trauma of existential incoherence.  In this they spy to usurp and exploit both the spiritual and physical neutering of man.  And he becomes, or so they imagine, that longed-for blank slate.  If the lady in a burqa is just as English as fish and chips, then it matters not whether the English lady in a barber jacket and Wellington boots disappears, since one being just as English as the other means England has never looked more English.  It is for this seamless transition between populations that radical immigrationists now advocate as an abstract form of some kind of radical reparations, a bizarre attempt at self-equalizing, a sycophantic endeavor to atone for historic wrongs by means of a comprehensive repeopling, to quote an article from last year's German HuffPo.  Attention Germans, fall in for comprehensive repeopling.  Why the German people should be abolished.  A little more genetic and cultural seed scattering here, and a little more self-abolition through reproduction fatigue there, would be the quote, most beautiful side of the perishing of a people.  We are either all foreigners, or no one is.  The Great Diversification Project is just that, a project.  The Soviets once tried something similar.  The experiment once went by the sarcastic name Homo Sovieticus, later turned into a satire by Alexander Zinoviev.  In a genre he classed as novel denunciation report tirade, which walks us through an attempt at social engineering so duplicitous, corrupt, inefficient, and simply maddening.  The failure?  Collectivisation through forced assimilation.  As Solzhenitsyn explains, the system that succeeds in destroying its victim has succeeded long before he mounts the scaffold.  The triumph of the Bolsheviks demanded that the tortured victim allow himself to be led to the noose without protesting, that he renounce and abandon himself to the point of ceasing to affirm his identity.  An excellent illustration of this predilection can be found in Rammstein's new video for the song Deutschland, a temporal snapshot of just one generation of German life, flung from militant blood and soil to militant self-colonization by the African Maghreb.  How is a soil fertile enough for such radical replacism created?  Those who aspire to total domination must liquidate all spontaneity, such as the mere existence of individuality will always engender.  They will track it down in its most private forms, regardless of how unpolitical and harmless these may seem.  Thus, through the process of demographic submersion, the Englishman becomes superfluous.  When anyone in the world, residing anywhere in the world, can be a bona fide Englishman, the communist goal of internationalism will have been realised.  This is why recent comments by John Cleese on the absence of Englishness in London was received so sorely.  Why should his comments be controversial when a stated aim of progressives for over a decade now has been to diversify our capital?  It seems his only observation is that London had finally achieved its stated goal.  Why are progressives not celebrating?  Because the true aim of diversification is neither to enrich nor cultivate, but to validate that longed-for falsehood that man, as David Hume once said, is a movable bundle of aggregates, a movable feast, for such is the heady narcotic to which all disciplinarians are attracted and see in themselves architects of the world.  Multiculturalism is the homo sovieticus of our time, the arrogant and dangerous supposition that man can author fellow man, and that the laws of nature will suspend in his wake, as though tolerance and diversity were legitimate contenders for millennia-old tribal wrath.  And, as innocuous as his comment was, what John Cleese demonstrated in his observation was the wisdom inherent in all the best idioms, that you can lead the horse to the fountain, but you cannot make it drink the water.  Despite all their years of hard work, all the propaganda, blackwashing, seduction and exhortation of history, there still remains only one eternal image of the Englishman.  The London of Dickens's Oliver Twist.  James Boswell and Pudding Lane.  Settle in large numbers as they have, and will no doubt continue, burka-sporting Saudis and their associate concubines will never be anything more than occupants in a city built by gentlemen.  A city they could not build, so had to steal.  That's why, when you move in, London becomes Londonistan.  There is no seamless transition, and even when the capital is 100% colonized, as it shall one day surely be so, you'll remain a cheap copy of a designer original.  And the seamless transition the communists hope for will not be immortalized with statues of grandeur in bronze relief paneling, but in the recent sign in Kensington reminding the new inhabitants not to defecate in the street.  A moveable feast indeed. ",
