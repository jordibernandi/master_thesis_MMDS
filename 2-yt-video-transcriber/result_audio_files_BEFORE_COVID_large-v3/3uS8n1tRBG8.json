You guys do that up here, really?  You don't remember that?  Really?  Over cameras, man?  It's a camera, it's not a gun, dude.  You guys sell cameras.  Fuck you expect us not to use them?  Family planning.  Customer assistance requested to toys.  Yep.  Don't you guys sell cameras here, man?  You know everything I got in my hand, man, I bought from here.  That's fucked up.  Can't even use this shit that I bought from here.  I'm never shopping this bullshit place again.  Alright guys, we decided to stick around for a little bit since they want to make contact and trip on public photographers.  So we actually walked inside too.  It's coming up.  Oh yeah, he's watching.  I'm watching you, watching me.  They're coming.  They're walking slow.  Have a good night.  What happened?  They have cameras on us all day, every day.  They check every receipt, like everybody are thieves here.  You do not have to show receipts.  You do not have to show receipts at the store.  This isn't Costco.  Hey, people don't sign contracts at this store.  They don't have to show you shit.  No receipt.  Possession is 19th of the law, stupid.  Sorry for having to close the door on you guys.  look who it is the crybaby assistant manager.  notice he's not saying nothing now.  did you cool down?  yet they know him and that manager knows cameras in use.  Hey, did they check you for your receipt?  You think that's normal?  So at Costco, you have to sign a form to show your receipt.  You have to show your receipt at Costco.  At Walmart, they automatically assume that you're a thief, that I'm a thief, and that you're a thief.  Only at Walmart, it's like a stereo.  No, no, no.  Yeah, no.  How do you feel?  How do you feel?  Alright guys, I'm going to go ahead and end that video there.  Thank you for watching, for all the love and support.  I appreciate you guys, and much love right back to you.

You know, let me know what you think about that guy.  But today I am going to return back to that Walmart and make an official complaint against that dude and get his name and everything.  So, yeah, once again, thank you guys for watching.  You know, stay encouraged, stay strong, and I'll see you soon.  A.B.  Watchman, and I'm signing out. ",
