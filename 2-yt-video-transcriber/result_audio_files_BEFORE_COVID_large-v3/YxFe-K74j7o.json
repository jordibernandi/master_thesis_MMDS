Look at this right here, a guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong, there's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.  You are incredibly shameful.  How are you doing, Alex?  You're just a, look at you, you are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.  You're going to go on the history books at the Criminal News Network.  This is one of the main, this is one of the main people right here.  who thinks you have no memory, who sits there and lobbies, show him, that sits there and lobbies people to take other news off, claiming they're fake.  and CNN is the fakest WMD, Gulf Arab State dictatorship.  So I would really like to know, you know, what is your relationship with Twitter as an employee of CNN?  Because you were so giddy and happy when you got Alex Jones.  And I would love to know, as a journalist, do you think it's appropriate to be celebrating the deplatforming and censorship of one of the most prominent conservatives in America?  You know, as an employee of CNN, you work, you lobby, you essentially lobby Twitter to have Alex Jones banned.  How is that not a violation of journalistic ethics?  Who is this guy?  I don't know.  I chased him down last night, too.  You don't know who he is?  No, I mean, there's a lot of people I don't know.  This is my producer.  You don't know who the guy on the microphone is?  No.  You really don't?  That's strange.  He's not with me.  Are you going to answer the question?  Why do you celebrate the good platforming of conservatives?  Why do you celebrate the good platforming of conservatives?  Why not, Oliver?  the dishonest and immoral manufacturers, luxury engines that are manufactured in Japan today.  I'm going to move to my home state of Tennessee.  You were so happy.  What is your relationship with Twitter as an employee at CLC?  Are you in favor of Twitter censoring conservatives?  Intended consequence of a, you think former NAFTA, Canada, Mexico, you don't think Jobs, Cummings now.  Isn't that kind of hypocritical?  You take pictures of people and you post about people.  The real target that we have with the USMCA... You can't even answer your question.  You can't even answer your question.  What is that all about?  Why can't you answer your question?  I'm choosing not to answer your question.  Why not?  Why not?  You have such a good mouth on CNN.  You can't answer your question.  I'm sorry.  I have to.  I don't know, but you're getting looming right now.  I'm going to ask you to buy it.  as a journalist for CNN, right?  Why, as a journalist for CNN, are you working to de-platform conservative media?  I'm sorry.  You don't have Media Pass, so you have to be angry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you please have to.  Why are you facilitating harassment campaigns and de-platforming campaigns against conservative media?  It is cool.  He's a member of the fake news media who works for CNN.  I would love to know.  I'm not answering your question, so... Okay, you.  All right.  As you can see, all of our doors, Darcy doesn't want to answer my questions.  You can stream live on Fox Nation as well.  If you don't have a conversation, you're missing out.  Okay.  It's Netflix.  It's Netflix.  It's Netflix.  It's Netflix.  It's Netflix.  It's Netflix.
