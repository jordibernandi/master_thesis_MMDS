            "text": "Shallow on call a lawyer.  how about you know shy by some cock with gosh the bonds into the apostles and elders?  citations to all my fellow laborers doing this work in truth and sincerity risking their lives and their freedom to do so.  to the hopeful elect to the confusion of face that adjoin them to our ranks the few aqua that are listening and learning.  to you I say shallow on.  you know double honors into the apostles and the elders.  this is your brother Malcolm from the branch of the great millstone here in Chicago coming at you with another lesson in truth and awareness.  this is a video about the corruption of the patty rollers who are nothing more than the slave patrol.  they're not here to serve and protect the people.  they're here to serve and protect the interests of the oligarchs which control America.  Part of their job is not to serve and protect the people, but to protect those interests and to oppress the Israelites.  Every president that's gone into office has implemented some form of oppression, starting with the war on drugs, going all the way back to Nixon, you know, and even before Nixon, you had the Jim Crow laws, you had the redlining, you know, you had the, when the slaves were so-called free, they were never free, the slaves were emancipated, and when you look that word up, that means to turn over ownership from one.  So all they did was they took the slaves away from the private owners and turned them over to the government.  And that's why they implemented the Jim Crow laws and all these different laws that kept them under oppression.  Because there were no patty rollers with this badge on that woman's chest.  And the Edomite woman is not innocent in this.  She's just as guilty as the man.  She's helped implement.  Matter of fact, she was the reason why a lot of the oppression for Jake.  False allegations of rape.  He looked at me.  He touched me.  A lot of things like that.  got men like this sitting on the ground uh hung beaten uh castrated and burned alive before mass crowds of people and they even took pictures with them.  you know you can just google that on the internet and you'll find thousands and thousands of images because it happened thousands and thousands of times.  and it's funny too how no racial no no facial recognition is being used to track down these people who are still alive but yet They'll track down, you know, some 90-year-old Nazi person for, you know, alleged crimes against the Jewish during World War II.  But no justice for Jacob, for the real Israelites.  So let's grab a scripture.  First scripture is... Zechariah 11 and five, it says whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and sell them and say, bless be the Lord for I am rich and their shepherds pity them not.  So we have no no shepherds to go out and pity us, but they slay us on film.  I mean, how many videos does it has to be of people complying?  or unarmed, being beaten, shot, tased, harassed by police.  And the police get no repercussions at all.  They get a paid vacation, or they get desk duty for a couple of months.  So now you get to sit behind a desk, drink coffee, eat donuts, and collect a paycheck while someone has lost their loved one at your wicked hands.  So without any further ado, let's witness the downfall of Esau Edom.  All right?  Because, you know, let me grab a scripture.  Which semi-applies to what you're seeing right here, because Jake is being emboldened and standing up against Esau.  And Esau is not used to this.  All right?  And that's going to show you the times when, because in times past, this guy who's videotaping them would have been hung, beaten, And so would the guy sitting on the ground.  Their bodies probably would have been strung up together in some black and white picture with these two posing with their bodies and the rest of the crowd of the people.  But this is a wisdom of Solomon.  five and one.  It says, and then show the righteous man standing great boldness before the face of such has afflicted him and made no account of his labors. ",

            "text": "Wow.  You don't understand the power of what you just witnessed.  He ran that man away.  Shut him down.  And he's the slave patrol.  He's the patty roller with the badge and the gun, man.  All right.  He basically ran that Edomite back to his car.  This is it, man.  All right.  Like the scripture says, you know, the devil is going to come down with great wrath because he had.  he know he have but a short time.  This never would have happened 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago.  All right.  Never.  Okay?  And these Edomites are so guilty of this sort of thing.  Let's click to another video.  We won't watch it, but we'll click to it just to read the title.  All right?  And it was on the Young Turks.  And the name of the video is, let me bring it up so you can get into the frame.  And it's Media Call Editing Police Brutality Video.  That's the top one on the top there.  Alright, police unarmed man in Mesa, Arizona.  Third one, CNN police beat down, caught on camera.  This is a regular thing with Jake being mistreated, man.  Alright, let me click down.  Warning, graphic content, woman claims police brutality.  The one there underneath it.  Texas police officer arrested in connection with shootings of black teen.  OK, you just had was it?  70 police officers arrested across a couple of states for putting a racial, you know, posts on their on their Facebook and that sort of thing, not hiding their faces.  They're emboldened because Esau Edom hates Jacob, man.  All right, and this is not just a so-called black man that this is happening to.  This happens to so-called Latinos, man, to the Northern Kingdom all the time.  I live predominantly around the Northern Kingdom, and all I see when I'm moving, traveling about is the youth, so-called Mexicans and Puerto Rican men, bent over the hood of cars with their pockets getting ran, just like that guy said.  The guy said, you're running him, all right?  getting their pockets ran through.  Tell them to spread your butt cheeks and lift your sack.  That's a joke, Dave Chappelle.  But basically that sort of treatment, man.  Just being mistreated.  And one thing I know for sure, that the people that do the most drugs or just as many, if not more, because they have the income to do it, are Edomites.  And when I'm up in their neighborhood during the day, Working, servicing clients, traveling about.  One thing you don't see is Edomites.  Even though I see them smoking and doing drugs all the time, you don't see Edomites in Lincoln Park, in Andersonville, in Bucktown.  And there's a lot of drugs done in those areas.  You better believe it.  Right?  In Wicca Park.  You don't see them bent over the hood of their cars getting their pockets ran.  You don't see that happening.  They don't enforce these laws in Edomite neighborhoods.  They only do that in Jake neighborhoods to fill up these prisons with all these false accusations and twisted laws to imprison and oppress Jake with much oppression.  A couple more scriptures.  This is 2nd Ezra's 11 and 32, but this head put the whole earth in fear and bear rule in it over all those that dwelt upon the earth with much oppression.  That's why the earth is raising up against these Edomites, man.  All right, because they do the same thing on another level to the other nations, to all the other brown nations with the presence of the military in their nations playing the same role as the patty rollers here in America.  And it, let me start that again.  But this head put the whole earth in fear and bear rule over it, all those that dwelt upon the earth with much oppression.  And it had the governance of the world more than all the wings that had been.  All right?  And this was talking about the Roman Empire, which America is an extension of the Roman Empire.  All right, the Roman was referred, the Roman Empire was referred to, their army was referred to as the Red Dragon.  And the scriptures talk about their dragon that was wounded but yet did live.  All right, Rome went down at the hands of Jacob.  That's why they hate Jacob so.  But then it was reborn through the Renaissance, you know.  That's why they don't like to bring up the history of the Negroes being the ruling class people over these Edomites, all during the Dark Ages and the earlier part of the medieval times.  no doing the time to shakespeare and all that sort of thing right he saw came into power after that doing a renaissance period every game power and whitewashed history.  you know israel.  you know the fate that you could come with the computer information age and all that evidence that you buried did.  you just simply didn't put it in in your books with all those books in an information still exist.  she thought it was not a fine as well to the internet To show you to be the liars that you are?  Last scripture, 2nd Ezra 11 and 40.  I'm going to read through 42.  And the fourth came and overcame all the beasts that were past and had power over the world with great fearfulness and over the whole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression.  And so long time dwelt upon the earth with deceit.  Everything about America and Esau, Edom and his rule is deceit.  His laws are full of deceit.  Everything is full of deceit.  He lies.  His history, what he teaches in school, his science, his Medicaid, everything about him is deceit.  For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.  For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, and thou hast loved liars and destroyed the dwellers of them.  that brought forth fruit.  Because most of the important inventions in America were created by the slaves, but yet they got no credit for it.  The so-called white man controlled, you know, and I hate that word, but Esau Edom controlled all the patents in the history and put his name everywhere.  Just look up Latimer.  How he sued Thomas Edison for stealing his invention of the light bulb, of the filament of the light bulb.  All right?  And the court records of him winning in court are out there.  But yet Edison still gets the credit.  That's still what gets taught to the children in the schools.  Lies and deceit.  All right?  For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, thou hast loved liars and destroyed the dwellers of them that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of such.  that did thee no harm.  And Jake does, but you know what?  Jake's starting to lash out now because it's that time, all right?  And Esau is going to pay with the sword destruction for all the wickedness they have done.  So with that, I'm going to give all praises, glory, and honor unto Yehawah by Shem Ha'Shai.  Baha Hashem, Rekhar Pardash, double honors unto the apostles and the elders, salutations to all my fellow laborers that are doing this work in truth and sincerity, putting their lives on the line, day in and day out, weekly doing this work.  Wa'abababa, Kwam Yasharallah. ",
