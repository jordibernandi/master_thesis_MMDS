            "text": "My dear children, I can sleep tonight Because I keep thinking about you when you're older.  You're too young now to understand everything that's happened.  But I know that someday you'll have so many questions.  And I hope that what I write will give you answers.  Everything is so different now.  Fading memories of things now gone.  The world is now just a dim reflection of the past.  Everyone we knew has been swept away.  There's only us few left to reveal everything.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I sometimes think about the war before, and I remember how evil everyone had become.  Your grandfather was the only one that still loved and obeyed the Creator, and he taught us to do the same.  Thank you.  Aside from your grandfather, the entire world had gone crazy.  And things just continued to get worse and worse.  Thank you.  I love you.  God told Noah that he was going to judge the world, but would spare us.  So many years were spent building that ship.  When we went inside, and got sealed or shut.  We know our lives would never be the same.  Thank you.  Our time on the ship felt like an eternity.  So many days of wondering what it looked like outside.  I don't think anything was quite as scary as walking off that ship for the first time.  We didn't know what to expect.  There we were standing in what felt like a foreign land in every direction.  but we were so thankful to be alive.  Our lives had been spared, but there was still a heavy sadness over all that had been lost.  We felt relief and joy, but also heartache and grief.  We now see new life all around us, beautiful reminders that there is a purpose in all that we have been through.  He has given us hope.  my beautiful little children.  I write these things so you never forget the past, so you embrace the future and remember the love we have been shown.  Look to the rainbow for the comfort of the promise.  With all my love, your mother.  Thank you.  Thank you.  hey Hey.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
