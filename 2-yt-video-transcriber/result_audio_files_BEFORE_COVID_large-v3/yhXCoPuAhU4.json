            "text": "I was trolling Google the other day and I found a whole bunch of Jehovah's Witness memes.  Some of them are pretty funny, some are based on complete misunderstandings.  So I figured we'd take a look, have a good laugh, and fix some misconceptions.  Okay, let's get into it.  Jehovah's Witness Challenge, expert level.  That's pretty funny.  So the question is, would Jehovah's Witnesses even bother?  Would they try to knock on a door?  that's so out of the way you have to take a boat to get there?  And the answer is, yes.  Now, I haven't been in it for over a decade, so I'm sure they do things a little bit differently than they used to when I was in it.  But when I was knocking on doors, everything was on paper.  They didn't use computers for basically anything at the time.  They printed out territory maps, which covered the entirety of our circuit, and you'd check the maps out at the literature counter.  They were small cards that showed which streets you had to hit, so you'd go to the area and hit every house on every street on the map.  They were laminated, so if a householder wanted you to put them on the do not call list, they'd mark it down on the territory map with a date.  If you don't want them to visit, the easy solution is just to tell them to put you on that list.  Every 10 years or so, they'd erase the map and start again, in case you moved or something.  People were supposed to check out the oldest maps first, so they'd get a good cycle going of hitting every house.  Typically, for my congregation of around 115 people, it took them about four years to cycle through all the maps in the circuit.  Then they'd start all over again.  For smaller congregations in bigger districts, it might take them 10 years to get to each house.  Okay, let's take a look at the next one.  Jehovah's Witnesses don't celebrate Halloween.  I guess they don't appreciate random people coming up to their doors.  That's pretty good.  It's entirely too true.  Halloween was one of the worst holidays for me because I was supposed to sit in the house with the lights off so people knew not to come to it.  So I was just kind of sitting in the dark.  And I couldn't watch TV because it was nothing but Halloween themed stuff.  I ended up just kind of sitting there in the dark silence.  It sucked.  But, on a happier note, Halloween is one of my favorite holidays now.  The entire neighborhood gets together and goes around collecting candy.  It's usually pretty cold, and sometimes it snows, which is right up my alley.  I collected candy too, for years.  Though it's kind of strange to see a father and daughter both collecting candy instead of just letting the kid collect it, and I got called on it a few times.  People refused to give me candy because I was in my mid-twenties.  so I started telling people I was collecting for Kylie's little sister, who, of course, is only her half-sister, and was running around with her parents collecting for herself.  Either way, it's an experience I didn't get when I was a kid, so I'm doing it now, and the detractors can suck it.  Next meme.  Your hand almost touched mine when I took the mic to answer.  I've informed the elders recording.  I love you.  This one is a little too close to home too.  You're already very repressed to begin with.  So everything you see, I mean everything, lampshades, couches, everything.  The thought of touching somebody's hand drives you insane.  It's super unhealthy.  And a lot of Jehovah's Witnesses get married entirely too young because, you know, there's no s*** before marriage.  So they have to make a lifelong commitment to fulfill a basic bodily function.  Everybody in my family except my brother, but including me, got married at 18.  Come to find out, that's not a great idea.  Lucky for me, the person I married isn't a bad person, so they aren't out for blood.  Separating was actually pretty straightforward.  We all agreed on what we wanted to do and went our separate ways.  Simple as that.  But come to find out, if she wanted, she could really ruin me.  Don't even get me started on divorce laws in West Virginia.  It's absurd.  We separated about eight years ago.  Two years after that, about six years ago, she got a boyfriend and had a kid with him.  We still weren't divorced, just separated.  Turns out, in West Virginia, and in most other states, since we were married when she got pregnant, it means I have to pay child support for the kid.  even though she lives with both of her biological parents.  It went all the way to the West Virginia Supreme Court, and they ruled against somebody who discovered the kid wasn't his.  And the mother can optionally choose to also get child support from both her husband or ex-husband and the biological father at the same time.  It feels like they missed the point of child support.  Anyways, like I was saying, getting married is like handing a knife to the other person and handing one to the government and facing the other direction.  To me, it seems outrageously foolish for somebody to get married at 18 years old.  Or at all, honestly, considering how badly they could ruin you if things go sideways.  But that's Jehovah's Witness life for you.  You aren't allowed to get divorced anyway, so what's it matter?  No matter how incompatible you are with your spouse, you have to stick it out to the bitter end.  Okay, next meme.  I don't know anything about Jehovah's Witnesses.  Oh good, then maybe you'll be interested.  This is another good one.  Honestly, Google is the bane of Jehovah's Witnesses religion.  Since they can just go back inside and Google whatever questions they might have, Jehovah's Witnesses conversion rate has dropped through the floor.  In 2018, Jehovah's Witnesses had to spend about 7,000 hours knocking on doors to bring a single person from knocking on their door to baptism.  There are some variables unaccounted for in that.  Like how many of those people were born into the religion.  How many of those hours are spent letter writing or preaching on social media instead of door knocking.  But for the most part, that's the figure.  And I remember getting about 20 hours of door knocking per month, give or take.  say four hours per day on Saturday and maybe two hours per day every other Sunday.  That's a pretty good amount of time devoted to it.  Going by that number, it should take them about 30 years of preaching on a regular schedule to bring in a single convert.  That's being super extra generous too.  So Jehovah's Witnesses have really started pushing their website.  It's on their Kingdom Halls, it's on their earrings, it's on their bumper stickers, it's in their tracts, in their books, in their Bible, and everywhere.  One might say they're almost treating it like an idol.  They have such a problem with people wearing cross necklaces.  But look at this.  They've got the damn things on their tie clips because they want people to go there instead of going straight to Google or YouTube to learn about them.  Hopefully what I do is reversing some of the strategy.  Okay, next meme.  How Jehovah's Witnesses view the Governing Body.  It shows a picture of the Last Supper with the Apostles there with Jesus.  How ex-Jehovah's Witnesses view the Governing Body.  A picture of dough from the Heaven's Gate cult.  How non-Jehovah's Witnesses view the Governing Body.  A big question mark.  Most people know almost nothing about them.  And how they really are.  A picture of them standing around laughing, saying, we told them they could live forever and they believed us.  This is pretty good, and it brings up a good question.  Does the Governing Body know what they're doing?  Are they in on the scam, or are they true believers themselves?  It's genuinely hard to know.  You can only guess.  But I was a member of the group for my entire childhood, and I've been following the group as an activist for years.  Knowing what I know about them, I'd probably say the same thing that Ray Franz, an ex-Governing Body member who turned apostate, said about them.  There might be one or two who know what they're doing, who are in on the scam, but the vast majority of the people at the top believe it.  It's honestly hard to know if they're true believers or not, and every time some really crazy information comes out about them, like the fact that they knew that something really sinister was going on, and they not only turned a blind eye, but they enabled it, it makes me think to myself, how could they possibly not realize they're all running a big scam and taking advantage of people?  How can they justify doing and saying the things they do and also completely believe their own propaganda?  It's mind-boggling.  But like I said, I think the vast majority of them are true believers.  Most of the people at the top were born and raised in the religion.  Not just the governing body members, but the helpers and the people who work on their cult compound too.  Occasionally you'll have one or two who converted later in life.  Like one of the governing body members, Tony Morris, obsessed with tight pants and drinks a little too much.  He was in the Vietnam War.  He converted after getting out of the military.  I mean, this dude had a full life before joining the religion.  He knows what the outside world is like.  It's just really hard to believe that he doesn't know what he's doing, considering the plans he's overseen within the religion.  Okay, next meme.  That moment when you know exactly who the local needs is about.  This one's a little more obscure, but let me explain.  In my congregation, we had our meetings on Sunday and Wednesday night, and our book study on Monday night.  The book study was an hour long, and we'd go to somebody's house.  Depending on the size of the congregation, there would be four or five book study groups.  The idea behind it is that you were supposed to get close to these people.  So when the end came, and it was a survival type of situation, if you couldn't reach the Kingdom Hall, you'd all meet up with that group of people.  They were kind of like sleeper cells.  Surprisingly, they did away with the book study groups after I left.  Anyways, on Wednesday nights, they'd give a local needs talk, basically targeting some specific thing that seemed to be a problem in the congregation.  Like, if somebody watched R-rated movies, or if they drank a little too much and too often.  or if they were getting a little too involved in politics or something like that, the elders in the congregation would basically write up a local needs talk about that subject to send a message.  So if the elders talk to you about your drinking habits, and the following week they give a big long talk about how we shouldn't be drinking too much alcohol, you know exactly who it's about.  And typically, everybody else in the congregation probably knows too.  If they didn't before, they will after the talk.  Because Jehovah's Witnesses are the absolute worst about gossiping.  What else is there to do but talk shit about people around you?  It's like their favorite pastime.  Which is probably why you see a lot of toxicity and drama in the ex-Jehovah's Witness community.  Anytime I see an ex-Jehovah's Witness starting something with somebody, I know exactly which Jehovah's Witness they were in the congregation.  Okay, next meme.  Oh yeah, that's pretty common.  Jehovah's Witnesses have always tried to be on the cutting edge of technology.  Like, even when they started out as a religion, they were using sound cards with big megaphones on top to spread the message.  And they'd go from door to door with a portable phonograph machine, playing a pre-recorded message from the leadership.  Much like how they try to cram Caleb and Sophia videos down people's throats now.  Over the years, they've always tried to look out for the disabled, which is actually pretty respectable.  So they accepted time counted writing letters and mailing them to people in the phone book, or cold calling people.  which are a couple of key ways in which disabled people can donate their time for free to the organization.  And they finally started accepting time spent preaching to people on social media.  Actually, a while back, I was talking to some people through a tweet thread on Twitter when some random dude shows up and starts defending Jehovah's Witnesses out of the blue.  We weren't even talking about Jehovah's Witnesses.  Starts posting articles to JW.org and everything.  I was like, do you know who I am?  Why are you here trying to push this stuff on us?  They apparently did not know who I was, so I told them.  They immediately blocked me and continued to tweet defenses of the religion at people in my thread.  Honestly, it might seem like a small thing, but it's really very painful.  When I see a Jehovah's Witness on a street corner, it's a clear reminder of the fact that there's an entire subset of the population that wishes I'd have a heart attack.  It's a reminder of what my own mother thinks of me.  And that's honestly what they want.  That's why they do it.  They want me to feel that way.  So it seems like it would be easy to blow them off and move on.  But the constant reminder sucks.  Okay, next meme.  It's a picture of Dr.  Phil.  It says, If I go somewhere and my wife and family aren't welcome, then I'm not welcome.  Somebody tells me that I'm to shun my wife and children, they can kiss my ass.  Hear, hear.  Well said, Dr.  Phil.  Honestly, Dr.  Phil has his problems.  But this is a shining moment for him.  He had some Jehovah's Witnesses on his show once, and they were in a shunning type of situation.  Where one of them wouldn't talk to the other, or something like that.  And he tore them apart for it.  That's where that line came from.  Mad respect for that one.  I don't care who you are.  If my family isn't welcome somewhere, neither am I. I am an extension of them.  We come as a package deal.  My friend David is disfellowshipped, and so is his wife.  His dad is an active Jehovah's Witness, and a while back, his dad told him he'd be willing to go out to eat with David and the kids, but he doesn't want David's wife to come, specifically because she's disfellowshipped.  No other reason.  David declined.  It's wrong to tear people apart like that.  Bottom line.  Okay, next one.  It says, 144,000?  The next time a Jehovah's Witness knocks on your door, nicely remind them that Jehovah's Witnesses interpret Revelation 14, 1-5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144,000. and that they have 7.7 million members.  and then ask them, why are they still knocking on people's doors?  Heaven is full.  To be fair, none of the Christian sects are good at math.  There's actually a lot wrong with this one, so let me take it one step at a time.  First of all, being Christian has nothing to do with how good at math you are or are not.  Second, that's right, they think only 144,000 people are going to heaven.  But contrary to other Christian groups, their ultimate goal isn't to get to heaven.  Most other Christians think that's where they go when they die.  Jehovah's Witnesses think they sit in the ground until Armageddon is over, at which point they'll be resurrected into perfect bodies and live in a Garden of Eden 2.0.  The 144,000 people going to heaven are supposed to serve as kings and priests in heaven alongside Jesus as joint heirs to the throne.  Which is kind of strange.  Joint heirs to the throne?  Is God gonna die?  Why does he need an heir to his throne?  Can't he just keep it for eternity?  why is he passing on the torch anyways?  being one of the people who goes to heaven isn't something you work to attain.  it isn't like after you knock on enough doors you earn the right to go to heaven.  it's just something you know you feel.  it's true.  for a while they thought that once there were a hundred forty four thousand anointed people the end would come.  So they were basically embracing anybody who claimed to be anointed, or one of those 144,000.  But then they realized that the end isn't coming, so they changed it up and they're a lot more strict about who gets in now.  They're like, are you sure?  I mean, you could be wrong about this.  Anyways, that's why that meme doesn't make any sense.  And there's nothing worse than a meme that's nonsensical or inaccurate in the information it spreads.  One more thing.  I notice it says here there are 7.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses.  Right now, there are actually 8.5 million.  I think there were 7.7 million a few years ago when I started YouTube in the first place.  Kind of an interesting way of gauging when the meme was created.  Anyways, that's all I've got for you.  If you like what I do, and you want to make sure I can continue to do it, you can support me in a few ways.  First, you can support me on Patreon.  That's probably the best way.  But if you want to get something back for your support, you can check out my Teespring.  I'm trying to make a shirt design for every cult I've covered.  I haven't gotten every one, but I'm working on it.  So check it out and see if your cult is up there.  Second, you can support me by checking out my game shop.  I sell controller, cartridge, and game box stands for every system from the original Nintendo and Sega Game Gear to the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.  So give that a look too.  And finally, if you want to support me in some way other than monetarily, you can check out my other YouTube channels.  I have a retro game channel where I answer questions like, why does Shy Guy have a mask?  And why are CRT TVs the best way to play retro games?  I also have the podcast, where I talk about stuff I don't feel I can say on a monetized channel.  And finally, I have my main channel, where I talk about cults.  I wish I didn't have to worry about dancing around subjects carefully in the first place, but I chose to do this as a full-time job, so unfortunately, I rely on YouTube's AdSense and on the support of patrons to continue doing the work I do.  Anyways, check me out in all those places if you haven't already.  Thanks for listening, guys.  Thank you. ",
