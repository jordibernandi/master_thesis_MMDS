            "text": "I'm going to talk about what happens when you do speak up and what's happened to people who've spoken up.  The first firestorm, really, of a voice being suppressed, Michael Bailey wrote a book called The Man Who Would Be Queen back in 2003.  The subtitle was The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism.  Transgender used to be called transsexualism.  And Bailey described the work of Ray Blanchard, who worked in the 1980s, who described two distinctly different types of transsexuals.  One was homosexual men, and that's what most people think of when we think of transgender, is that these are gay men.  They traditionally have been just dissatisfied with societal sexual stereotypes and expectations for men, and believing instead that they must really be women.  And in the past, they had support for that.  But Bailey noted that Blanchard also said that there are, heterosexual men called autogynephilic.  That was Blanchard's term.  It was coined in 1989.  And it means men who are erotically obsessed with the image of themselves as women.  They are not women trapped in a man's body.  They have sexual arousal at the idea of themselves as women.  and they now probably are the majority of transgender-identified males.  They are really more men trapped in men's bodies, and Anne Lawrence, who is himself a trans-identified man, wrote a book about that called Men Trapped in Men's Bodies, where he interviewed over 300 of these guys.  So the book would have gone, it probably would have been gone nowhere.  It was nominated for a Lambda Literary Foundation Award, which it didn't get.  It only sold a few thousand copies and probably would have gone nowhere were it not for the firestorm that erupted.  Transgender activists said that the book was misleading, that it was false, and what they did made it into a book written in 2015 by Alice Drager, who's a science historian called Galileo's Middle Finger.  This was a book about scientific controversies and threats to a free press and free academic inquiry.  And in Bailey's case, Drager writes that a small group tried to bury a politically challenging scientific theory by killing the messenger.  So the firestorm that erupted wasn't really directed at Bailey's ideas, it was directed at Bailey.  Draeger did essentially investigative reporting.  She interviewed every single individual involved, every person that Bailey had interviewed in his book.  She dug up original documents and she corroborated or debunked every claim.  The transgender activists who assailed Bailey accused him of abusing the rights of subjects, having sex with a subject, making up data.  They accused him, he received threats and harassments via emails relentlessly.  Pictures of his kids were posted online with sexualized captions.  He was accused of sodomizing his own daughter.  His academic colleagues were contacted and were told that Bailey was an alcoholic and they should encourage him to move.  They accused him of practicing without a license and that he had no ethics oversight in his research.  Draeger, who did a terrific job, identified an individual who set up really an enormous website hosted by a large state university for the purpose of taking down Bailey.  And she said that she figured out that what really had been done, that it wasn't his ideas, that it was essentially set up in an effort to shut him up about autogynephilia, one of the hallmarks of which is denying that you have it.  Ultimately Bailey was pressured and pressured and pressured into stepping down from his department chairmanship at Northwestern University.  It gets better.  Kenneth Zucker, this isn't his paper, but Kenneth Zucker in 2015 was head and had been head for decades of a clinic in Toronto called the Child, Youth, and Family Gender Identity Clinic, or GIC, which was under the umbrella of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health, or CAM.  He was a researcher.  He developed the DSM-5 criteria for gender dysphoria.  He helped write standards of care guidelines for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.  He believed in helping kids feel comfortable in their own bodies.  He believed that that gender is malleable at young ages, and that gender dysphoria is likely to resolve with time.  His approach is called watchful waiting, where you just kind of support the kids, watch them, help them through what are very, very difficult years, and discover, and this is one of the things where there is good research on, discover that most of them just desist and decide not to transgender if left alone.  However, because of this watchful waiting, his clinic had actually been closed in 2014.  The CAM said the wait list was too long.  They laid off the only other full-time staff member, a psychologist, on the day she came back from maternity leave, and they continued.  activists continued to pressure the center to review Zucker's approach, which they did.  And the review, which Zucker read, included a factual error, which was not changed before the review was posted online.  There were interviews of only a few activists and clinicians who said that the clinic practiced conversion therapy.  There were photos taken of patients and patients printed, posted without patient consent.  Former patients were interviewed who said they'd been traumatized by the clinic and there was a false allegation by a former patient that Zucker had mocked his body.  Zucker was essentially fired on the spot and his clinic was closed down.  Over 500 of Zucker's colleagues signed a petition in his defense.  In the fall of 2018, he finally received an apology for Cam for erroneously representing his behavior in words.  The apology admitted that the report made false allegations and errors, yes, errors were made about Zucker, but the clinic stayed closed.  We move on to 2017, and James Caspian at Bath Spa University in UK decided to do a master's degree.  So he proposed a research project.  He'd spoken with a surgeon who was getting more and more patients wanting their transients and surgeries reversed.  Those people who would like to go back are called detransitioners.  And Bath Spa, the university initially said, hey, that's great, let's do that.  We accept your proposal.  But then Caspian discovered that a lot of people who detransitioned did not necessarily have surgery.  or wanted to detransition for other reasons.  So he wanted to include all detransitioners.  He was interested in the phenomenon as a whole.  The university said, no, you can't do that because attacks on social media may not be confined to the researcher, but may involve the university, and it might cause offense.  He ultimately, yeah.  He ultimately went to court earlier this year, but unfortunately, the case was brought too late, so the court said, you know, we can't hear it, but they did acknowledge that there was an issue of academic freedom of expression.  That, I don't know, you can hardly read it, but Lisa Littman, the end of last summer, published a paper originally titled Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Young Adults, a Study of Parental Reports.  within days of publication, trans activist pressured Brown University that the study was misleading because it said that there was a phenomenon, which she called rapid onset gender dysphoria, of kids spending tremendous amounts of times with each other online and in real life, but primarily online.  I mean, these kids spend hours and hours and hours a day reading about other kids being trans and about how to trans.  And I encourage you, if you haven't done it, to go on.  I hate to say this, Tumblr, and other sites, and read what kids are saying to each other.  The trans activists said, no, this isn't true.  It's misleading.  There are methodological errors.  And within days, the university removed the press release about the paper from their website.  And with continued pressure, the journal re-reviewed the paper, which is a really extraordinary thing to do.  Not only did they re-review it, I mean, they got, you know, just senior editors, statisticians, academic editors, and what they found, lo and behold, that the results were identical.  But they did rename the paper, Parent Reports of Adolescents and Young Adults Perceived to Show Signs of a Rapid Onset of Gender Dysphoria.  The Littman says that things were reframed, including the new title, but reframed mostly to emphasize that reports from parents have limitations, which was acknowledged in the original paper, and that rapid onset gender dysphoria is not a clinical diagnosis, which was not claimed in the original paper, but rather a described phenomenon.  So, that's Lisa Littman with her redone paper.  Moving on.  You have to wonder then, after this has been going on, why the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2016 allowed the Human Rights Commission to take the lead in writing their guidelines for supporting and caring for transgender children.  The lead author is a 25-year-old woman, a trans-identified female, who is not a physician, who essentially wrote and directed these set of guidelines.  There were 12 authors.  There were only five physicians.  Out of 66,000 pediatrician members of the American Association of Pediatrics, the input was really from less than 30 people.  And the contributors on this original 2016 set of guidelines included one physician who was the director of a transgender health clinic at which 100% of the patients, the kids who came in, were considered appropriate for transition, 100%.  There was another physician who was director of another gender clinic who says that self-identification as homosexual can be a normal first step for trans people.  However, it was significantly revised in October of 2018.  Now, this was written by physicians, but it was published to provide guidance for parents and clinicians through a gender-affirming approach.  Watchful waiting was deemed unsupportive.  And it stated that the mental health issues that kids have because there are a tremendous number of associated comorbidities aside from autism, other psychiatric disorders, depression, a whole host of things.  The revision stated that mental health issues are really from stigma and negative experiences rather than being intrinsic to the child.  And the The conflation or the confusion between sexual orientation and gender identity is kind of exploited in conversion therapy bans.  There are now conversion therapy bans in effect in 15 states.  They were passed from August of 2013 to January of 2019.  Until recently, it just meant using psychological techniques to try and change someone's sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual, although there is no reliable evidence that this is effective.  Current conversion therapy bands are applicable to both sexual orientation and gender identity.  So what do you do, especially when there's a director of a gender identity clinic saying, well, homosexual is just a step on the way to trans.  There are consistent reliable findings that gender non-conforming kids, you know, boys who prefer traditionally feminine activities and girls who prefer climbing trees and playing with trucks, will often go on to become generally healthy gay and lesbian people as adults.  And that will happen significantly more than them going on to be straight, although that does happen.  So most kids who insist they are the opposite sex, if left alone, no longer have this belief or desire after puberty and with watchful waiting.  I would think that ultimately we would want kids to be comfortable with themselves and their bodies and that this is a priori a better outcome than lifelong hormones with irreversible effects, irreversible surgeries, sterility, and struggling to believe the impossible, that they are the opposite sex, which can never happen.  And there is not a lot of data.  There really are not a whole lot of studies.  What studies there are, this is really a very good, you can find it online.  You can Google it.  This gentleman is a layman who gets it.  The best studies show the worst outcomes.  Given the sometimes heated debate around transgenderism in general and trans and kids in particular, and the toxicities of the drugs used and drastic body alterations of the surgeries, along with the irreversibility of both, I mean, one would expect that there'd be an explosion in research or a demand for research about what is gender dysphoria really.  I know there's a definition, but again, if you go to these online places, there are kids directing other kids, well, you have to say this.  Here's what you say.  This is how you get the medications.  This is how you get them to give you the stuff.  And when they talk about their experiences, it's not the definition of gender dysphoria at all.  For many girls, it's great dissatisfaction with how they're treated as girls being treated, being sexualized at very young ages by boys grabbing them and calling them really awful things.  For the boys, some may be young future gay men.  Some of them may be young autogynephilic males who will grow up to be autogynephilic men since the onset is at puberty.  So, one would expect an explosion in research about what gender dysphoria really is, about the efficacy of transitioning to relieve gender dysphoria.  It doesn't work.  Whether the risks of the medical and surgical interventions outweigh any benefits.  What are the long-term treatment effects?  There's a concept called burden of treatment that, you know, when you're deciding, do I want to get treated for this, that, or the other, where there's a very low risk that the treatment will work, will I accept the burdens that this treatment lays on me.  And you would expect research about the adverse effects.  And you would also expect that patients, parents, and physicians would want high-quality, objective research to answer really important questions about what's being treated, if it's effective for the underlying condition, and the risks, and does it work in the long term.  Lay people get all that.  In studies of... There we go.  The problem with most studies is that they are, on trans kids, is that they're cross-sectional.  They're just a one-shot study, which can tell you about incidents of certain phenomenon, but doesn't tell you about long-term effects, changes, or consequences.  There are often controls that are lacking.  There are no control subjects.  And that if you do have a control subject, you really need control subjects that are the actual same sex as the kid, the trans kid, and also of the sex that the kid thinks he is transing into.  There are confounding factors.  The major confounding factor in kids, as we saw, is homosexuality, since if most of these kids were left alone, that's what would happen to them.  So don't you want to know what percentage of kids would really go on to be same-sex attracted?  Is there any difference between why kids want to trans if they're boys or girls, if they're lesbians or if they're straight girls or if they're bisexual, if they're boys who are autogynephilic, if they're boys who are homosexual, or if there are maybe a few boys who will turn out to be.  in neither of those categories.  I would want to know about those things.  Maybe those kids, probably those kids need to be treated differently.  There are also, in most of the studies, very, very high rates of loss to follow-up and very short study periods.  Longer studies of patients who are followed up consistently show increasingly negative outcomes.  after a one to two year honeymoon period where people report, hey, everything is great.  Starting at about five years and for five to ten years, the rates of suicide start to go up dramatically.  And this is supposedly after being well integrated into society as the supposed new sex.  The loss to follow-up isn't because those people are doing well.  In studies of other medical and surgical conditions, patients lost to follow-up after treatment are generally found to have a fairly, not insignificant at least, proportion of people who are doing poorly rather than well when you do track them down.  So ultimately, as doctors, we really do want people to feel better.  I mean, we do.  You come in, and we want you to feel better.  And we practice.  We hope we practice with an evidence-based practice based on what studies are really telling us.  We hope it's based on high-quality research.  And when you work with kids, you want to be an advocate for kids.  because, I mean, Is there anyone in this room who doesn't remember some really dumb decision they made when they were 11 years old?  I mean, yeah, and even more so when you're, I think somebody said, you know, still believing in the tooth fairy.  So you want to really advocate for kids.  And the best science for public policy and clinical decisions, without cherry picking, you can't say, well, I like this science and I don't like this science.  because it does or doesn't support my preconceived beliefs.  So you want the best science.  Physicians, you saw what happened to a lot of prominent researchers who wrote books, how they were harassed.  You can go online and see what happens to many women in particular who speak out, who get death and rape threats.  Physicians themselves, you know, you fear loss of employment.  Patient satisfaction surveys, believe it or not, are not so much measures of quality of care, but do measure how patients are satisfied about what they feel the diagnosis they were given is and what the treatment was.  And I don't know if you know, but those are sometimes tied to continued employment.  If you get too many not-so-good ones, and too many can sometimes even be two or three, Sometimes employment is terminated or advances in pay are terminated.  So there's a fear.  Doctors don't want to get harassed.  Doctors may not so much fear getting sued, but hospitals do.  There's a case in the news right now of a hospital that's refusing to perform a hysterectomy on a trans-identified female who is still an adolescent, I believe, and the hospital looks to be possibly getting sued.  Doctors are also overwhelmed keeping up with a new body of very flawed literature.  Trans patients are, it's tough to deal with them.  They require large amounts of usually uncompensated time.  The discussions are very difficult to have.  There is often conflict within families because it is so difficult and parents are sort of at a loss of what to do.  And it is easier in many cases to acquiesce to providing medical and surgical solutions to social and psychological issues.  Thank you. ",
