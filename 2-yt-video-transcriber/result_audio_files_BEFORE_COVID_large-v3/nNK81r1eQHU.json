            "text": "2020, the year of the rat.  Curse of illness, famine, and death.  But what if these yin and yang cycles were set in stone and there is nothing, absolutely nothing that we can do about it?  The 2020 Kung Flu panic is upon us in the year of the rat.  47 million people on lockdown, a quarantine in China larger than the population of California.  But should this surprise anyone, if we were to study the cycles of the earth, life and death, would it not be clear that the cycles are as constant as winter, spring, summer, and fall?  Let's dive into the history of the rat.  1804, the Haiti Massacre, ethnic cleaning of all white people.  1816, the year of no summer and sickness raged on.  1828 was the year that the Democratic Party was unleashed on the people, an illness that still plagues the land today.  1840, Napoleon was poisoned to death.  The year of the rat curse continues.  1852, Devil's Island penal colony was specifically created to kill people.  1864, the Civil War raged on, the most deadly plague in American history.  1876, the Indian Wars rained down death and destruction.  The year of the rat, 1888, America suffered through the Great Blizzard, and across the pond, Jack the Ripper was never caught.  In 1900, ushered in the San Francisco Plague.  And in 1912, the year of the rat, the Titanic sinks, and the rest is history.  1924, the Russian Lenin dies, opening the door for Joseph Stalin to murder millions and millions of humans.  In 1936, the Great West China Famine raged on.  King George dies.  The Great Depression is raging on in America.  And Stalin, his great purge, officially begins in the Soviet Union.  1948.  The Arab-Israeli wars, which have implications of death to this very day.  1960, the birth control pill was introduced, snuffing out how many lives.  1972, probably one of the deadliest years in history for plane crashes.  1984 gave us the Ethiopian flu.  And the year of the rat curse continues in 1996 as a major earthquake rocks West China.  In 2008, the housing crisis rocked America to its very core.  And finally, last but not least, we have 2020.  The Kung Flu virus escapes the laboratory and spreads like wildfire across the land. ",
