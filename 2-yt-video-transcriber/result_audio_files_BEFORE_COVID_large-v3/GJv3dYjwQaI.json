And that question is, will your great-great-granddaughter be able to survive in a world without a second eyelid and her own tech claw?  Hi, everybody.  I'm Bill Whittle here with Steve Green and Scott Ott, and this is your grim warning of a future that is coming and is unavoidable and what you can do to prepare for it.  We turn to the sun, that beacon of integrity.  I'm sorry, I beg your pardon, the Daily Star.  They all get mixed up for me.  And we learn the story of Mindy.  It's a computer rendering of what the people of 2100 will look like.  And folks, it ain't pretty.  Looking at this 3D rendering of the humans of the future, we see some of the following features.  Hunched backs and arched back and neck.  We see thick skull and smaller brain.  Second eyelids to protect against accidental exposure to daylight.  And of course, the tech claw.  I've seen people like this in shopping malls all the time.  Now, Steve, let's start with you.  The reason I'm picking this story is so I can tell my very favorite story of all time, which I've never had a chance to tell before.  That's simply this.  I was 19 years old.  We were walking into Jack Horkheimer's office at the Miami Planetarium.  And in front of me was a short, stout guy who nobody particularly liked.  He was kind of a Kind of an ass little guy.  In front of him was a regular guy who was a technician.  And then I came in third and I was six foot one and probably 140 pounds.  And as we walked into the room, I turned to Jack and I said, you know, this looks like one of those charts of the evolution of man.  But I'm not joking.  If you look at this person, as serious as I can be now, you see the hunch and everybody knows the drawing we're talking about.  There's Gibbons and Chimps and then Neanderthal.  And finally, there stands Homo sapiens.  And then now it starts to go down a little bit.  It's starting to digress, which makes me want to conserve things.  And how about you? ",

And there's this brilliant scene where they've kept him locked up in his own sensory deprivation tank for like a week until his brain turns to porridge.  Alan Arkin, in this brilliant bit of physical comedy, gets out of the sensory deprivation tank in his wetsuit.  As he crawls out of the tank and starts to walk, he goes through the stages of man in the chart.  It's an absolute brilliant bit.  I guess now, if you play that in reverse, you'll see exactly what we're talking about.  I don't know what to do about this.  I really don't.  You know what I would rather do?  You're going to talk about the bad stuff.  Let me talk about the empowering part, the good stuff, and then we'll all go back to being cranky old bastards after that.  The Navy's new Virginia-class attack subs, just the stealthiest, deadliest boats ever put underwater, have this high-tech electronic mass.  So instead of having the huge old-fashioned periscope that goes up that says, You know, you can see for miles and miles away on radar or whatever.  It just has this little slender fiber optic rod that is invisible to radar and hardly does anything.  But the Navy didn't know what they were going to do to control this thing.  And they were coming up with ideas for like multi-million dollar controllers to make this thing work.  And what they settled on was an off-the-shelf Xbox controller.  And the best part is you don't even have to train the sailors to use it.  You give them an Xbox controller and... They're up there scouting around this jillion-dollar fiber optic cable.  So in a sense, the good side is this technology empowers us to do things that we could never do before.  And I suppose now that I've done the bright and sunny side, you're going to have to tell us at what cost, huh? ",

But the reason I say that there are these conflicting trends is the ubiquitous presence of video in the hands of young people these days has actually led them to be able to see and become interested in things that they never otherwise would have done.  Many of these things are what we would categorize as extreme sports.  Things involving snowboarding and mountain climbing and those crazy bicycling guys who are riding along the top of a four inch wide cliff.  at the top of a mountain.  I was just looking at a story about a guy who just climbed El Capitan with no ropes and just completely barehanded up there.  One of my sons, who's very active in online stuff and using his phone for video and games and stuff like that, also goes to this place several times a week where he pretends to climb mountains.  It's one of these artificial climbing wall kind of things.  And I think it used to be back in the day when a new snowboarding or skiing trick was developed, there would be one guy who owned that trick for a while, you know, because nobody really could do it.  Now, as soon as that trick goes online, there's like a thousand guys who are waiting to see what the next latest trick is and they're out there emulating it.  And so oddly enough, It depends on how you use it.  This technology is, I think, actually fostered more and more aggressive outdoor activity that involves physical activity than otherwise might have happened.  That said, there are a lot of people who are perfectly content to let other people in the world exert themselves and they will just sit there and stare.  Perhaps the only thing is, the difference is that when we were watching TV in my house as a kid, we were sitting upright on a tufted, tight-backed velvet sofa.  And we had to have good posture because my grandmother would not tolerate us slouching over at the table.  But what were we doing?  We were watching the Brady Bunch.  We were watching... some, some, you know, entertainment on TV.  Entertainment has changed.  Now it's in the palm of your hand.  Someday they will be mounting it on helmets in front of your face or perhaps even glasses.  I have an idea.  Why don't we project it onto the inside of a glass?  We should get with Google about that.  I don't think that there's as big as a scare involved.  I don't think that this vision is going to come to fruitation as one of my friends, uh, engaged in malapropism years ago.  Um, I do think it's a risk personally, and I think you need to look at your own life and go, hey, am I really sucking up hour upon hour just scrolling through social media or just staring at my phone?  And if so, isn't there like a world out there? ",

Just the last time I saw it was just a few days ago.  A family goes into a Five Guys hamburger place.  The mom and the the daughter and the son are all on their devices.  They're all working on different things and they're not doing astronomy and they're not looking at the latest pictures from Pluto and they're not even learning space port tricks.  They're playing Candy Crush kind of games where they're moving little flashy things around.  No screens at the table.  They walk down and they get it from the thing.  Now look, I know how this sounds.  I mean, I know how it sounds and I also know that if I'd had one of these as a kid, I'd never leave the house.  But you have to leave the house.  And so the question I have is a serious, serious question now.  Either this will continue or it won't.  I think that's a fairly reasonable assumption on my part.  And what I mean by that is this.  Either the world will continue to become more and more digital where the skill set that this young generation has, and they are astonishingly fast on these machines and processing multiple sources of information, either the world where that ability becomes essential.  and also How am I trying to put this?  If that world becomes fact, then the support system for people who are hunched over all the time and who never go outdoors has to also be in place.  Somebody has to be out there getting the food and the resources and running the electric power plants and so on.  So if that world is there, then that's problematic.  If most of the people in the country are sitting hunched over computers or cell phones or whatever, What is the quality of human life in that regard?  And much more compelling to me, and I think more likely too, is that it won't last.  And then what do you do?  What do you do with your tech claw if it turns out that now you have to pull apples off of trees?  This is dangerous ground.  And when you're talking about a device that is so addictive and so compelling, that parents are sitting next to kids who are literally, honestly, truthfully, 90 degrees away from the vertical, you have to start asking yourself, at what point does this miracle become more than a miracle and become an addiction and become something that is very, very dangerous, both physically and mentally, I suspect.  Anyway, Mindy, you need to sit up.  You need to put the phone down.  You need to open both those eyelids, and then you need to go for a walk.  For Steve Green and Scott Ott, I'm Bill Whittle.
