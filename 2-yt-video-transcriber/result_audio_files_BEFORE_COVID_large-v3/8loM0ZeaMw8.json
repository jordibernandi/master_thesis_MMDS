            "text": "A man complains of a bad night's sleep and the feeling of being jolted awake shortly after drifting off.  He uses an odd term to describe this.  I was displaced, he says.  Hmm.  When asked what he associates to this word displaced, he begins talking about his job.  He builds skyscrapers for a living.  And as part of this, he has to factor in the movement of a building at high altitudes due to wind.  In his field, he says, this movement is referred to by the technical term displacement.  He talks a bit more, this time about his early life, and in particular his family's migration as a result of a war in a foreign country.  He talks about the childhood experience of moving to another continent to begin a new life.  He talks about the recent migrant crisis, the experience of refugees.  Do you realize you're talking about displacement?  I ask.  In 1957, Lacan gave an interview to the French magazine L'Express.  When we speak of repression, Lacan said, we imagine a pressure like a vague, mysterious mass exerting all its weight against the door that we refuse to open.  But, he said, repression is inseparable from the return of the repressed.  Something continues to function, something continues to speak in the place where it was repressed.  People tend to think that Lacan is hard, hard to read, hard to understand, deliberately obscure, willfully but skillfully evasive.  Yet this interview, and in particular these comments about repression, show that's not always the case.  So let's look a little more at what Lacan had to say.  What is repression?  There's really three questions here, because in psychoanalysis, the problem of repression is really three problems.  One, if something is repressed, where is it repressed to?  This is the problem of locality, what Freud called the topographical problem.  Two, why is it necessary to repress something in the first place?  This is a problem with psychodynamics, what Freud called the dynamic problem.  And three, if something is repressed, how does it stay repressed?  What investment is necessary to push it down, pull it down, or keep it down?  And in what quantities?  This Freud called the economic problem.  Repression is a term that gets bandied around a lot in psychological circles, but sometimes we don't know what we're talking about.  The term was used way before Freud, but when he picked it up, he was very careful with it.  Freud started off by comparing it to political repression, like state censorship, but then he realized things are a bit more complicated.  If he wanted his theory of repression to make any sense, he had to answer these three questions.  Lacan's interviewer in 1957 was a woman called Madeleine Chapsal, still alive at the time of this video.  She'd read a bit of Freud and mused, If Freud has said something new, it was that in psychic life we're all ill because we conceal, we hide a part of oneself, we repress.  This is where Lacan jumped in to disagree.  Repression isn't the forcing up of something unpleasant that was buried in the depths, he said, nor is it the pushing down of something we refuse to acknowledge.  It's the coming into place of a substitute.  Something continues to speak in the place where it was repressed.  Freud's idea was that repression leads to the creation of a substitutive formation.  One thought or idea is substituted for another.  In the example we started with, we can see the word displacement as a substitute that emerges in place of thoughts around migration.  We don't yet know why, but we don't have to.  For now, what matters is noticing this operation at work.  And the way we notice it is by being attentive to the exact words that someone uses to describe their own experience.  It might seem odd to us to describe being jolted awake as being displaced, when there are many other, we might think, better ways to describe it.  But we have to respect the fact that this word is what occurred to the man rather than any other.  What's interesting to the psychoanalytic here is the fact that a word like displacement has more than one meaning for the man in our example.  Now, this doesn't mean that repression is some dark, mysterious or malevolent force.  It's a very innocuous operation that hides in plain sight.  For it's said that substitutes are not the product of repression itself.  They're the product of the return of the repressed.  In other words, it's not that we repress too much, but that what is inevitably repressed will inevitably come back.  And when it does, it will take the form of a substitute that is particularly well-suited for that purpose, precisely because it appears so innocuous.  Repression is such a subtle operation because it works on speech, language, words, words like displacement, rather than on instincts, drives, impulses, or emotions.  In the interview, Lacombe makes this point very nicely.  When the subject represses, this does not mean that he refuses to gain consciousness as something like an instinct, like, for example, a sexual instinct, he says.  Instead, he represses the speech where it has the role of a signifier.  In simple terms, a signifier can be a word or a part of a word, but one which is unhinged from any particular meaning, any fixed representational referent, and which thereby refers only to other signifiers in that structure rather than to a particular meaning or signification.  Displacement is a good example.  It can refer to the movement of a building, the migration of refugees, or, in our example, the reason you didn't sleep well one night.  You see, Lacan says, it's not a vague, dubious thing which is repressed.  It's not a sort of need or tendency that could have been articulated and then can't be articulated because it's repressed.  It's a discourse that's already articulated, already formulated in a language.  It's all there.  What we're left with as a result of oppression is a telltale sign that substitution has taken place.  For example, in the use of an odd phrase like, I was displaced, to describe being jolted awake.  Lacan thinks that this is what, as psychoanalysts, we should listen for.  Substitutes might also take the form of symptoms.  They may be quieter or louder.  For example, in obsession, repression works very discreetly, via a substitute by displacement, often onto something very small or indifferent, as Freud says.  In other cases, that substitute might be written on the body, as it were.  They don't always have to be as dramatic as the kind of hysterical convulsions and paralysis that Freud had witnessed in Charcot's clinic in the late 19th century.  Often, the harbinger of the beginning of the end of a romantic relationship comes when one of the partners contracts a sudden cold or develops a mysterious food intolerance that passes just after the breakup.  These substitute symptoms arise because they serve to keep the two people apart, standing in for what cannot yet be said, speaking where spoken words are missing.  As Freud put it, symptoms like these have joined in the conversation.  Lacan goes on.  In psychoanalysis, repression is not the repression of a thing.  It's a repression of a truth.  What happens then, he asks, when we want to repress a truth?  The whole history of tyranny is there to give us the answer.  It's expressed elsewhere, in another register, in a ciphered, clandestine language.  The repressed truth will persist, just transposed to another language.  In psychoanalysis, the surface is not the superficial.  What's repressed is, in a sense, right there on the surface.  We just have to be able to see how the substitute is formed.  In our example, the man was well aware of what displacement meant in his job, and well aware of what it meant in relation to being the son of a refugee family.  He just didn't connect the two.  He didn't realise that in talking about displacement, he was talking about displacements.  We see repression at work when we don't make these connections.  Often the emotion gets split off from the idea.  The thought gets separated from the feeling.  We might be angry towards our boss, but really we're angry at a partner or parent.  So the boss here is just the substitute.  Feelings will always make themselves felt.  It's the link between ideas rather than the anger itself that gets repressed.  There's really no such thing as a repressed emotion, as Freud says.  The repressed finds expression elsewhere, though.  Just like under repressive regimes, this might be through codes and conventions, a private meaning or inflection that's intended to be understood a certain way.  If I write a message in black ink, it's false.  In blue ink, it's true.  The content is not repressed, but how will the censor know what to redact if they lack the key?  It's not the message itself that's hidden or encrypted, but the key to understanding it.  In the same way, the message remains at the surface, available for everyone to read, but in the form of a substitute.  This is why Lacan says that the repressed and the return of the repressed should be treated as the same thing.  It is, as Lacan says, expressed elsewhere in a ciphered, clandestine language.  But who is the censor here?  Not a government agency, not state censorship.  We ourselves?  Many psychological theories fall into this trap.  It's called the homunculus problem, the tendency to explain human actions in a way that implies a little man or woman inside our head telling us what to do, censoring us, critiquing us, motivating us, or whatever.  If we take ourselves or part of ourselves as censors, That is, if we believe we repress a truth about ourselves, well, good news.  We just have to liberate ourselves from this repression, and then we'll be able to speak freely, think clearly, have more fulfilling sex, be less self-limiting, and get back in touch with reality.  No, says Lacan again.  And this is where things get interesting in psychoanalysis.  As we've described it here, repression seems to imply that there's something outside ourselves, that we are spoken as much as we speak.  Lacan thought that if we're not aware that the words we use mean more than we mean in using them, the word displacement in our example, and if this tells us something about the nature of repression and the unconscious, then we can no longer be sure who it is that's speaking.  It speaks, Lacan says.  Truth has not fallen into the abyss.  When Lacan says that it's being turned into unconscious here, he is emphasizing the unconscious as radically other to our consciousness.  Importantly, this doesn't mean that we're limited or constrained in what we can say.  We can still talk about everything we want to talk about, but we're not the master of our own words when we do.  What we say may convey a meaning which is intimate to us, which speaks about us and us personally, but of which we're totally unaware.  In this sense, the repressed doesn't come from deep down inside us.  It comes from outside us.  It's a kind of external intimacy or extimacy, as Lacan would later call it.  This decentering of ourselves is why Lacan thinks it's better to ask, from where does it speak, rather than who is speaking.  He gets this from Freud.  Lacan's lifelong claim is that he's just bringing out of Freud's text the implication that was inherent to it.  Since Freud, the center of man is not where we thought it was, one has to go on from there.  Do you know Freud's formula, there where it was, I must be?  Lacan asks his interviewer.  Freud isn't talking about the id and the ego, Lacan suggests, because if he were, he would have said the id and the ego.  Lacan reads Freud the way Freud reads dreams, symptoms, and slips, literally.  So Freud is talking about the it which speaks.  If you're psychologically minded, you'll probably be wondering what kind of psychology this implies for human beings.  If you're philosophically minded, you'll have already noticed this has big implications for how we think of subjectivity and ontology.  This is what Freud really discovered.  Not the caricatured idea that repression means we don't want to acknowledge something about ourselves, and so we push it down into the depths of our psyche.  neither that we're the victims of societal repression that we just have to overcome in order to live more fulfilling lives.  Freud's discovery was much more radical.  It shows us the difficulty of thinking in terms of inside and outside, surface and depth, repressed and the return of the repressed when we think of human psychology.
