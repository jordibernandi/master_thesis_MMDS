            "text": "Now, because Smollett is facing a minimum of one year in jail, his attorneys have adopted victimhood as a defense.  You see, Smollett is the victim of a police spectacle.  And of course, it was all because he has an untreated drug problem.  So don't send him to jail.  This man needs rehabilitation in one of those luxury rehab centers.  Oh, and they're no longer mulling that recast.  Smollett's character has been cut from Empire.  Anyway, as threatened in last week's video, I wanted to concentrate on the numerous celebrities, politicians, and journalists that jumped on this story without a shred of skepticism.  But first, why do they do it?  Well, in the case of politicians, virtue signaling has become political currency, and left-leaning politicians have a particular type of virtue signaling they like to engage in.  For example, they promote themselves as anti-racist, as though this is a brave stance to take rather than the default position that the vast majority of the population already agree with.  So when an alleged racial incident occurs, they are drawn like moths to a flame.  They rush in, posture, and collect their share of virtue tokens.  Also in the mix is a healthy dose of Trump derangement syndrome.  So eager are Trump's political opponents to find evidence of the hate-filled society of Trump's America, they'll believe anything that confirms their pre-existing biases.  And remember, this happened just a week and a half after the Covington Boys High incident.  And that's why for journalists, this type of piling on without any evidence is inexcusable, completely neglecting one of the most important aspects of their job.  And as for celebrities, well, that's just the type of behavior we've come to expect from unhinged emotional infants.  Kevin Fallon is a journalist for the Daily Beast.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking.  Anyway, he virtue-tweeted the following.  People in MAGA hats recognized and then beat and poured bleach on Jussie Smollett, calling him that faggot from Empire.  Anyone who thinks supporting you-know-who is in tantamount to providing artillery for weaponized bigotry needs to take a hard look in the mirror.  Well, I suggest we all pitch in and crowdfund a desperately needed full-length mirror for Kevin Fallon.  Then there's Joshua Rivera, who wrote in an article dated January 29th, the racist homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far right America's endgame.  Now, thankfully, I made a screenshot of that more than a week ago, because today, if you click that same link, here's what you get.  The racist homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is America's endgame.  Interesting.  At least they have admitted some culpability for the error in this editor's note.  In the original version of this piece, published January 29, before allegations that actor Jussie Smollett had perpetrated a hoax, GQ made two errors in editorial judgment.  Well, three, actually.  You employed Joshua Rivera.  We failed to clearly present the post as an opinion piece, and we regret applying unfounded political motivations to then breaking news, With the original headline, the racist homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far right America's endgame.  We have altered the headline, but have otherwise left the original post unaltered.  But why then change the headline?  The piece still contains all of its original political bias.  Here's a taste.  The cautious wording is one last wound inflicted on Smollett's battered body.  A careful hedging of bets that don't need hedging.  A crime scene involving a corpse is not discussed as a possible death.  But the stodgy apparatus of law enforcement isn't particularly interested in acknowledging social ills.  And neither is the news media when it goose steps around the truth of the matter with shallow euphemisms like racially charged used to describe open, proud bigotry.  And I'm sure goose steps is a deep euphemism according to Joshua Rivera.  I mean, how do these people still have jobs with this level of incompetence and bias?  And then we have this cavalcade of stupidity.  And this is America in 2019. ",
