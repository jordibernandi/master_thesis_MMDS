            "text": "Hello, everyone.  In today's video, we're going to be talking about abortion, particularly about how the attitude of abortion supporters has become a lot bolder and a lot more extreme since it was first legalized in the US in 1973.  For quite some time, abortion as a whole seemed to have been, quote unquote, justified by insisting that it's necessary in situations such as when a woman is a victim of rape or of incest, and also arguing that since it's a woman's body, it should therefore be a woman's choice.  Now, regarding the first argument, rape and incest are actually the lowest on the list of why women choose to get abortions, but with that said, even if they weren't the lowest on the list, choosing to abort a baby that was produced out of rape or incest, it's it's still ending the life of an innocent baby.  In a study that was released by the Guttmacher Institute, which is the most recent statistics that seem to be available on this subject, women were asked to provide reasons why they chose to have an abortion.  And the top three reasons were 74% felt that having a baby would dramatically change my life which includes interrupting education, interfering with job and career, and or concern over other children or dependents.  73% felt that they can't afford a baby now due to various reasons such as being unmarried, being a student, inability to afford childcare, or basic needs of life, etc.  And 48% don't want to be a single mother or were having relationship problems.  And the bottom two reasons, the lowest reasons on the entire list, were firstly, 0.5% became pregnant as a result of incest, and 1% said that they were a victim of rape.  Regarding the second argument, it's a woman's body, therefore it should be a woman's choice, the very premise is fallacious.  It's not a woman's body, it's a completely separate human body growing inside her own, developing its own arms, legs, hands, feet, eyes, organs, and so on.  Some argue that since the baby needs to live off the mother while in the womb, then abortion must be justified.  But this really doesn't make any sense because even after you've given birth to a baby, they still need many years of care from their parents before they can survive on their own.  So if you stand by this argument, then it would have to mean you would be okay with aborting babies up until the point that they can actually take care of themselves.  Nowadays, while there are some women who still do use the arguments, it's a woman's body, therefore it should be a woman's choice.  What if a baby has been conceived out of rape or of incest?  There are many women who have completely moved past these arguments altogether, perhaps because of how normalized abortion has become, and they have taken their stances to a much more extreme level.  In an article entitled, Abortion is Morally Good, The author justifies abortion with such quotes as, nothing I've lived through will convince an Alabama Republican to change his mind.  To them, nothing I've done in my 31 years on the earth, none of my accomplishments, none of my happiness elevates my worth above that of an embryo.  There are stories bleaker and more violent than mine, and they won't persuade Alabama Republicans either.  There is only one just and moral response to the anti-abortion movement, and that is to strike down its arguments in their entirety.  A fetus is a possibility, not a person.  While abortion can be the tragic end to a wanted pregnancy, it's never murder.  The opposite position is extreme and a threat to the health and safety of women.  There is no compromise.  not on the personhood of women.  You can't find middle ground.  Firstly, nobody is saying that a baby's life is inherently worth more than its mother's.  That a mother is useless and can just be tossed to the curb.  Both lives are valuable.  But what this woman is saying is that a baby's life is inherently worth less than its mother's.  In fact, she doesn't even refer to it as a baby, she refers to it as an embryo or a fetus.  She also claims that abortion isn't murder, which is the statement that I find most telling about this article.  Many abortion supporters, not all of them, but many of them have convinced themselves that abortion isn't murder in order to justify their support of it.  They're dehumanizing the babies, calling them just a possibility as opposed to an actual living human being and instead shifting all of the focus onto the mother.  The very last thing they want to be dwelling upon is the fact that unless the mother aborts her child or has a miscarriage, then one day that baby's going to be born, it's going to have its own life, its own dreams, its own accomplishments, perhaps even its own family.  Something else that I find particularly unjust regarding the abortion debate is that men who wish to provide for and to help raise the children rarely ever get a say.  Women alone get to decide whether the baby lives or dies.  Take a look at this video that I stumbled across of a man outside an abortion clinic begging his partner not to abort their child.  Please help her to listen.  Help her to listen.  No, don't do it.  Abby, don't kill our baby!  Abby!  Oh my gosh.  You would think that most people would have at least an inkling of compassion for this man's grief, even if they're people who support a woman's right to have an abortion.  But I mean, some of the replies under this tweet, they're just unbelievably heartless.  If he wants a baby, he can find a willing partner to gestate one.  He does not get to force this woman to give birth because he wants a baby.  Oh my lord.  Assuming this is real, how did he know when she had her appointment?  Was he stalking her?  Does he not give a shit about what she's going through?  Does he think he can control her with his drama?  Did he wear a condom?  She is definitely better off without him.  Sounds like he's too much of a crybaby to be a good father anyway.  Too bad, so sad, she's not his effing herb garden.  To be perfectly honest though, the callousness of these tweets, it really comes as no surprise given that the attitude surrounding abortion is becoming more and more accepted, even even celebratory over time.  There was the Shout Your Abortion social media campaign where people share their abortion experiences online without, quote, sadness, shame, or regret for the purpose of, quote, destigmatization, normalization, and putting an end to shame.  There was also the infamous Twitter thread where a pro-life woman wrote, look at this little baby, just nine weeks old, those tiny little hands, those tiny little fingers, that tiny smile, that precious life, hashtag pro-life.  Few times in my entire existence have I ever seen such disregard for human life as many of the replies to this tweet.  Apparently there's also a new trend that fetishizes abortion wherein couples find some kind of sexual high in purposefully getting pregnant and then aborting their unborn babies.  Summit News recently uncovered couples discussing the disturbing sexual fetish on Reddit.  The comments came from a post where one user explained that their female friend, quote, has a really powerful fetish for breeding.  She is with a male partner currently who is just like her, into breeding and they have been practicing their fetish for quite a few abortions, the commenter wrote, noting that their friend never uses birth control.  Apparently the friend is not the only one destroying unborn babies for her perverted sexual kink.  Another person commenting on the post said he and his girlfriend have the same fetish.  according to the report.  Quote, my girlfriend enjoys her pregnancies and she enjoys the abortion, the person responded.  Her preferred date to abort is between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation.  I enjoy making her pregnant and I enjoy the time of her pregnancy.  She has no menstrual period and she is sexually very active.  And most recently I came across a photo on Instagram of a tattoo artist who tattooed this on another girl and she called it one of her favorite tattoos that she'd ever done.  With this ever increasing shameless attitude, It really comes as no surprise that abortion advocates keep pushing the boundaries, now even going so far as to advocate for infanticide.  On the 46th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the New York State Senate passed the Reproductive Health Act, and it was signed into law by Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo.  The law, which is likely the most expansive abortion bill in the country, allows late-term abortion until the baby's due date, if it meets certain requirements.  Not only is this kind of legal protection of late-term abortion an affront to the humanity of the unborn and the dignity of society, but New York celebrated it publicly as if it had just won the Super Bowl.  When the bill passed, video shows the assembly chamber erupting into cheers with politicians and audience members applauding the bill as if it were a victorious symbol of strength.  Two of the most heinous parts of the bill describe the new parameters of abortion.  If, quote, the patient is within 24 weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, and second, and this is the worst qualifier, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health.  The wording of that second phrase is so comprehensive, even in legal lingo, protecting the patient's health could mean almost anything.  To be clear, this is not the passage of abortion rights, but the permission to commit infanticide and call it by another name.  An eight pound baby can survive outside the womb with very little medical aid.  Late term abortion procedures are goalish and graphic.  The Lazier Institute reports that, quote, abortions performed after 20 weeks gestation when not done by induction of labor, which leads to fetal death due to prematurity, are most commonly performed by dilation and evacuation procedures.  These particularly gruesome surgical techniques involve crushing, dismemberment, and removal of a fetal body from a woman's uterus.  Mere weeks before or even after, the fetus reaches a developmental age of potential viability outside the mother.  And if all of that wasn't enough, there have been a number of scandals recently involving the abortion industry.  First, there was the Stem Express CEO who admitted to selling beating baby hearts, intact baby heads, in the delayed hearing.  And then a few weeks ago, there were more than 2,200 medically preserved fetal remains discovered at the home of a former abortion doctor who had passed away.  My question right now is, where is all the mainstream media coverage of these absolute horrors?  There should be wall-to-wall media coverage, but we've hardly heard a peep.  Instead, all day long we're told that we're monsters for not wanting children and their parents to illegally cross the border into the US.  Why is it that the left cares so much for the children of strangers, but yet when it comes to their own children, they're perfectly fine with murdering them?  If we as a society continue on this course, we're going to continue crossing more and more extreme and unforgivable lines.  Late term abortion will be legalized in every state, and who knows, maybe even after the children are born.  Considering we're now a society that allows for child drag queens, child transgenders, drag queen story time for children at libraries, and so on, I wouldn't be surprised.  There's a quote that says, a society that can't protect its own children has no future.  Well, we as a society are much worse than that because we can in fact protect our own children, we're just deliberately choosing not to.  Personally, considering the current climate, I don't think banning abortion would do much good.  Women would continue to have abortions illegally and the ban likely wouldn't be permanent because there's too many people both average and those in positions of power who are in favor of it.  What would have to change to see abortion stamped out is our morality.  We would need a return to God.  If we change on the inside, then that change will manifest physically and reflect in the actions that we do.  Instead of wanting to kill our children, as was done in the 47.5 million abortions that have occurred since 1973 and 2015, we will instead want to keep them, value them, protect them, and love them.  If you happen to be pro-life, on the fence, or even an abortion supporter, please do consider checking out the work of Lila Rose or Abby Johnson, who once worked at Planned Parenthood as a clinic director, but resigned after watching an abortion on ultrasound.
