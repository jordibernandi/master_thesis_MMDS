            "text": "Hello, here I am again, Dr.  Claude Anderson and the powernomics.com YouTube channel.  Here's where we connect the dots in history so that black folk have a better understanding of where we are and how we got where we are.  And equally as important, what we must come to learn to do to get out from where we are, because we are in a predicament that nobody wants to address, not any political party or political candidate or civil rights organization wants to address these issues.  And unfortunately, the two organizations that really, really had the national visibility for addressing issues pertaining to black folk.  That was the Urban League and the NAACP.  They are now basically irrelevant and defunct because what they did, they spent all their hopes on trying to make themselves attractive to major white corporations to get subsidies and have them subsidize them.  And that's where they went.  sold their souls to these corporations and now these major corporations are going to abandon them and leave them with no place to go and no money to take them there.  And so here we are, right now again, on the YouTube channel, connecting the dots to try to find out what can we do for black folk in general.  And what I'm going to do today is try to address a couple of questions that were raised in the comments section of the Power Numbers YouTube channel.  And let me take one for you.  Here, someone wrote in and what was it?  Oh, here's, this was Tyrone Shepherd.  This, and I must compliment him.  This guy wrote an excellent question and comment.  And I thank him for it.  And that's the kind of thinking blacks I need.  If I had about, out of 46 million blacks in the country, if I had about half that number that were really critically analyzing our circumstances and trying to connect the dots on how we got into this mess, what we're going to do to get out of it, or we would get out of it real fast.  But usually I tell people, and they say, Dr.  Adams, are we going to be able to do it?  I said, we won't be able to do it until we learn how to understand critically what is necessary, what actions must we take to get out of it.  And that's what the issue is.  And right now, Black folk are not taking the appropriate steps, and they won't get out of it unless they get more pain.  And I guarantee you that right now, that the power structure in this country is set to produce a lot of pain on black folk and it's starting with this 2020 election.  But let's go back to Tyrone Shepherd.  He wrote an excellent comment and he raised a question.  Here's what his question was.  Dr.  Anderson, I have a very important constitution question for you.  Has the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision of the 1857, has it ever been reversed?  He said, I've been reading conflicting opinions on this matter.  He says that a matter of fact, even former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, let it slip from his mouth during his unsuccessful presidential run that the Dred Scott decision was still the law of the land.  What is the law?  Is that the truth?  And what is the truth?  Well, let me tell you, Huckabee really stumbled into the truth.  And because most blacks don't know that the Dred Scott decision is still active.  Now, what is the Dred Scott decision?  In 1857, when Dred Scott stumbled his way up to the Supreme Court, being financed and subsidized by a few white abolitionists and trying to declare himself to be no longer enslaved in this country because he had relocated temporarily from Missouri up to Ohio and Illinois.  Therefore, he said, I left the state of Missouri, so I'm supposed to be free.  And he went before the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court Chief Justice and their body majority said, basically, and the Chief Justice was Taney.  He says that, no, you're not.  He said, in this country, a black man is basically a non-citizen and he's property.  You're non-citizens and you are property.  And property and non-citizens have no rights.  And as a black person, therefore, unlike anybody else from outside the country, you have no rights that a white person is bound to respect.  He was not equating Dred Scott to an Asian or Arab or Hispanic or an Indian or gay or a midget or humpback, anybody.  He was talking about black folk because black folk constitutionally in the first constitution, in the first 12 amendments from one through 12, it said black people are property equal to a field land of three fifths of a human being.  He says, you have no rights, you're property.  And so that was what the Dred Scott decision said.  in 1857.  Now, a few liberal Republicans said, well, when the Civil War ended, they said, we got to go back and correct that Dred Scott decision because we can't have that.  Blacks are supposed to be free now because the southern conservatives, red states in the country that are still supporting Donald Trump today, and then the Confederate states keep talking about, we're going to rise again.  We've attacked the United States once.  We attacked the United States in the 1960s.  We're going to come back in 2020 and attack the United States again and take over because right now we're not going to ever give black folk those rights and privileges they're entitled to.  And so what happens is that liberal Republicans after the Civil War says we've got to do something to make sure that the rights of black folk are preserved constitutionally, not just in rhetoric.  Let's preserve it.  so that they've enacted through legislation the 13th amendment which says that black folk are now free, slavery is now forbidden, and black folk must be provided in all equal and all opportunities that whites are provided in society.  That is the original intent of the 13th amendment.  Now the 14th amendment followed that and said now if you're going to provide them they must be.  not only must you provide them freedom from slavery, but it's also mandated that every level of government, city government, county government, state government, the federal government, must exercise all necessary measures and mandates to make sure that Black, that the legacies of slavery, those legacies, those bad things that would happen to Black folk, the images and everything else, the deprivation is lifted off of their shoulders.  And that was the original intent of the 14th Amendment.  But yet, Nobody's going back to the original tent.  So let's go to this civil rights law now, following that 14th Amendment in 1865 and 1866.  What this says is that in this country, the only thing that a black person can be is, there are two things they can be in this country.  They're either going to be free or they're going to be slaves.  But to be free as black people, native blacks in this country, not blacks coming in from Africa or Caribbean and places like South America, but then to be free they must minimally have what they never were given.  They were stripped of everything, rights, resources, religion, language, culture, history, name, everything.  But minimally, they must have, to be a competitive people to regain those things, they must have 40 acres, a mule, and $100.  And that is so that we can reverse the Dred Scott decision so they can have something.  And because they're no longer be property, they can own property.  That they're no longer be non-citizens, they'll be citizens.  And that's what, and so that's what the 14th amendment said.  And the civil rights law was put into effect saying that this is strictly and solely for black people, not for anyone else.  And so in its specific purpose is to reverse the Dred Scott decision of 1857.  Now, now let's jump up.  about four years after that by 1859, guess what?  1869, guess what?  some white meat laborers from New Orleans said they want to use the 14th Amendment.  And so they went to the Supreme Court to try to use it.  The Supreme Court said, we are forced to tell you that no white person is entitled to use the 14th Amendment.  It was written strictly and solely for black people, in alliance with the original intent of the 13th Amendment, 14th Amendment, and the civil rights laws were written for one specific purpose, to make sure that they put Black folk into a position, a legal position, where they can no longer be exploited, misused, subordinated, and re-enslaved in this country.  And that was called a slaughterhouse case.  That decision came out in 1872 out of the United States Supreme Court.  And so consequently, Blacks.  Those amendments became what's known as a second constitution for black folk.  That stayed in effect up until about 1875.  By 1875, some things happened in this country.  that said, we gotta reverse that condition.  We gotta reverse it because the South then had cut a deal with the North saying that you've given back our land.  You gave amnesty to everybody who fought with the South.  You gave amnesty to all the Confederate soldiers who fought.  So you're no longer going to lynch them or castrate them or hang them or being terrorists.  You're going to give them back everything that they had before slavery.  When they did that, the South got back all the land and all the privileges and rights, and they put it in what they call the Black Codes.  or the later was called Jim Crow resegregation because they brought black folk back in again to re-enslave them.  Why?  Because they said they still needed, they can't have free slave labor, they needed cheap black labor.  And so the peonage and codes and the black codes came from an agreement between the North and the South, re-enslave black folk, semi-enslave them in the South.  And when they did that, then at that point in time, They had to nullify the Dred Scott decision, not the Dred Scott, but the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendment.  So the United States Supreme Court jumped into the battle and said, here's what we'll do.  What we'll do is that we'll rule that most of those things that were given to Black folk during what we call Reconstruction, Reconstruction period.  It went from 1865 up to 1875.  All that the 13th and 14th and 15th Amendment and the nine civil rights laws will rule them as being unconstitutional if they were painted the black folk.  Now, the United States Supreme Court did not have that statutory authority, but nobody has challenged it.  Our black leadership, our black lawyers have never, never challenged that.  The United States Supreme Court has no constitutional authority to intervene in congressional enactments on behalf of black folk.  13th and 14th and 15th Amendment and the Civil Rights Law of 1866 was supposed to have been strictly for black folk.  But the Supreme Court jumped in and exercised jurisdiction they did not have.  They used it based on what we call a Mulder and Madison decision of 1803.  They took and generated some authority.  they did not have to go in and say that everything that was given to black folk following the Civil War is now it's going to be two things.  Most of those laws will be ruled unconstitutional.  The 13th and 14th and 15th Amendment, those things now we would call them being neutral.  And for everybody, anybody can go in there and use them and pretend that they're equal to black folk in this country.  That's what killed off those efforts to reverse the Dred Scott decision of 1857.  And they've been doing that over and over again.  And so the Civil Rights Law of 1866 then became in 1965, 1964, President Johnson picked it up and says he had legislature enacting a law in 1964, which says that the civil rights law is now for everybody.  It's for minorities, poor folk, everything else.  And that generated a women's movement in this country.  It generated a gay movement in this country, a handicap movement in this country generated everything.  Everybody became equal to black folk on paper.  And in reality, they came in and went over black folk.  That's why black folk in the same subordinated position that they were in during Jim Crow segregation and slavery.  They're in the same, identical position.  Nothing has changed.  So consequently, in summary, there were laws that were passed in the second constitution to reverse the Drea Scott decision of 1857.  But the United States Supreme Court cut a deal and allowed a deal to happen between the North and the South to keep black folks subordinated.  Supreme Court put the icing on the cake, said y'all are neutralized out.  and that reverses, so the reversal of the 1857 Drea Scott decision does not apply.  So you're still where you were in 1857.  Black people are still now suffering under the Dred Scott decision.  Because even though the Second Constitution was instituted and legislated, the general broad white population has refused to accept it.  The Supreme Court has neutralized they won't accept it.  That's why in this country.  now, just like it was in 1860, 98% of all the whites in the country opposed freeing the slaves in 1860.  Now after 150 years, 88% of all the whites in the country still do not want to be associated with blacks and they harbor some hatred and disgust and some ill feelings about black in America.  That the racism in America has gone down 10 points in 150 years.  So the Dred Scott decision, in fact, legislatively it was supposed to be reversed, but the Dred Scott decision was not reversed by the United States Supreme Court and the general white population overruled it, corrupted it, and sent it back to where it was in 1857.  Thank you, and I'll see you at the next powernomics.com, connecting the dots. ",
