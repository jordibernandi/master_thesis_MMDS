I stated a fact and indicated that most people that had a basic understanding of the world would be able to understand this fact and recognize it.

I'll put a link to his Instagram account in the description of this video, and you really should check it out.  He's got some cool stuff.  Now, P-Brain, shadows seem to confuse you as much as the rotation of the Earth and centrifugal force does.  So let me see if I can help you out a little bit.  In order for a shadow to appear, it has to appear on something.  It doesn't appear in thin air, as you can see.  For example, you can see the shadow on the counter, and you can see the shadow on the backstop, but you can't see any shadow between the tip of his hat and the tip of the shadow, even though we should be looking right at it.  Kind of see how that works now?  Maybe?  The sun had to be coming from an angle or an altitude lower than the peak of the mountain. ",

The apparent position can be lower and cast that shadow from your perspective.  Okay, see that light at the end of the road?  That's a street light.  That street light is about 30 to 40 feet high.  This sign is, let's say, 12 feet high.  Okay, I'm sitting here on the road looking at it, and so the shadow goes up from my perspective, even though that street light is higher than that sign, maybe three times higher. ",

            "text": "Okay, P-Brain, right now is when I'm going to start to gut you.  Now, this is why flirfs like you that don't have even a rudimentary understanding of perspective shouldn't draw cartoons to try and prove your point.  Now, We're going to go back to your original premise, and that is we're going to have a sign which is going to be represented by that battery.  And then we're going to have a street light that is two or three times higher than that sign represented by the light up there.  Let's see the setup.  Now, as you can see, I've got this light set up on my counter on top of the coffee cup, and then some distance away, I have the battery, I have my backstop, and I have my little friend, the Flurf.  Well, as you can see here, my setup in reality on the counter in my office is exactly the same as P-Brain's setup in his silly little cartoon.  The difference being is that my objects are going to behave according to real perspective, Whereas P-Brain's cartoon is drawn to reflect his blatant misunderstanding of perspective.  Right about now, a lot of channels would say, I can predict what's going to happen when I turn that light on.  And if I'm right and you're wrong, I'll bet you channels.  But that's really unfair because I actually know what's going on and your clue is P-Brain.  But let's go ahead and see anyhow.  Now the first thing that we're going to do is turn on the light and cast a shadow with the battery right up against the white paper.  And as you can see, I've marked it.  Now looking at it, you can see the mark is a little shorter than the actual battery.  Now here we've added a second battery, a little bit closer to the light source.  We turn the light source back on, we see that the original battery right up against the backstop, the shadow is still right at the mark.  Now we have a shorter shadow, and I've marked that as well.  Now again, both these shadows are with the light source three times as high as the battery.  Now once again, with the camera right on the counter, as it was on the first time, we see that both batteries appear to be higher than the source of light.  But you know, what happens when you lower the light source down below the top of the sign?  Like this.  Well, what you get again is with the battery that's right up against the backstop, the shadow's about the same size as the battery.  But on the battery that's closer to the light source, it's considerably taller.  Here you can see a closer view.  just to confirm to yourself that they're marked accurately.  Notice that I've put a blue arrow by the shadows cast by the lower light source.  Now P-Brain, you could have saved yourself an awful lot of embarrassment just with a flashlight and a couple of batteries.  You see, in order for a shadow to be higher than the object that casts it, the light source has to be lower than the object that casts it.  Most people understand that, as I said in my video.  Now you mocked it, and you mocked it because you're one of the people who don't understand it.  Now one of the reasons that you don't understand it, P-Brain, is because you don't understand this concept right here.  You see the two batteries?  They're both the same size.  We're going to take a photograph from below to the counter against that much taller coffee cup with a light on it in the back.  You see how it seems to be relatively smaller?  Yet, if you bring it up to the level of the top of the batteries, you can clearly see that the light source is much higher than the batteries are.  That's perspective.  And that's why when most people look at this photograph of Mount Rainier, they understand that the sun is lower than the summit of that mountain in order to cast that shadow upward onto the clouds.  You're just not one of those people, Chief. ",

Now, here's an example of what I talk about with Flat Earth and just the complete disconnect between their brain and their narrative.  Now, in this case, P-Brain is trying to tell us that the sun sets due to perspective.  And the reason the sun doesn't appear to be smaller as it gets further away, as perspective would dictate, is because you just need to change your view a little bit.  So he tries to go into this orthographic view of the sunset.  and then says, look, the balls are the same size now, and puts a close-up in showing the balls different sizes.  Can you not see that? ",
