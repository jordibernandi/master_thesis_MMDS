In 2003, for example, when soldier Jessica Lynch was taken prisoner by Iraqi forces, it was a combat camera team that captured her rescue by U.S.  Special Operations.  The Pentagon was later accused of dramatizing details of the rescue to lift waning public support for the war.  In 2008, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate named Miles Ligozzi signed up for the Marines and became a combat camera videographer for his unit in Afghanistan.  After his deployment in 2011, Lugosi went rogue, shooting footage that undermined official messaging, including scenes of Marines smoking hash and joking about death.  After being discharged from the Marines, Lugosi compiled that footage into Combat Obscura, a new feature-length documentary that aims to show the real story of what's happening on the ground in Afghanistan.

As far as like the broader issue of like what effect does imagery have?  I think it's tough because a lot of this footage is already out there on these kind of war porn sites.  If you want to see pretty much anything, you can just Google it and find it.  As far as putting it into a feature documentary, I don't think it's been done too much in the past.  I think that a lot of the documentaries, and especially news coverage that comes out, tends to sanitize. ",
