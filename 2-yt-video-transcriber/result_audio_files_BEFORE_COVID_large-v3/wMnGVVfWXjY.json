            "text": "What can we do?  Build a brick wall.  As far as him being out here taking pictures, video, and I can't look.  Okay, do your thing about it.  I'll try to tell you that, but y'all waste the resources.  So today we are in Belton, South Carolina at the Odell Oil Company.  This is where we are here.  Look at that.  Autographing or otherwise reporting this facility is or its operations is prohibited.  Look at that.  You gotta love that.  Let's go see this sign here.  This sign here says the same thing.  That sign says the exact same thing.  Access to this facility is limited.  Photographing or otherwise recording.  That's an interesting statement.  We'll see how that goes.  Y'all stay tuned.  So they don't have anything about recording here on this fence here.  It's a visitor.  parking is back down that way.  But they don't say anything about recording this property.  They got something about Homeland Security on there.  So you would think that they would know.  I would hope they would.  But again, we are down here in Belton, South Carolina.  Oh, we got some interested people coming out here.  now, y'all.  Look at them.  I can't hear you.  The whole facility?  Well, both of them, really.  Get some information on them.  I'm sorry, brother.  I can't hear you.  What kind of information do you need?  A whole lot of information, honestly.  A whole lot of it.  Visitor parking is back along the side here or is it in the gate on the side?  We need to know what you're looking for.  Say what?  We can't just give out our information.  Oh, no, no, no.  I didn't have any questions about it towards y'all.  I can kind of find out what I need out this way.  Who are you?  I'm an operator.  Operator here.  What's your name?  That's irrelevant.  I understand that.  Can I have your name?  Okay, I was just asking.  Yeah, I'm going to have to.  Okay, that's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Inside the fence is.  You said what I need pictures for?  Well, I can't say it right now because it's not published.  But you can call the people.  That's fine.  Okay.  I'll be along the way somewhere.  I'll be along the road somewhere.  I didn't drive.  I'm a step ahead of everybody, but.  I'll be alone here somewhere.  I'm not leaving.  I'm just walking.  I promise I'll be in the area.  And when they come out, can y'all come back out, please?  Thank you.  So he didn't want to give his name.  He didn't want to give his name.  But we're here.  And this is private property, but that is a public utility right here and there.  But they're going... They're going to call the police.  So we're going to hang out until they call them and see how this goes.  So y'all stay tuned, please.  So they decided to send somebody out here to talk to me, right?  That's about to start, right?  I wonder if he's going to get out to be here.  Come on.  Don't waste the trip.  If you don't get out the car, come talk to me.  These guys completely.  It's going to start raining, which is the crazy part.  So I'm actually going to get soaking wet.  But again, I'm in Belk, South Carolina at the oil company on a road here.  33 feet from the center line of the road.  I have their property line in my phone.  And there are public utilities all right here.  Some are in their property.  Some are right here, which is outside of the fence.  And their trespassing signs are on the fence, which is beyond me.  It's very beyond me.  And he's just sitting here.  If you turn it sideways, you get a better picture.  If you turn your phone sideways, you get a better picture.  Hey, buddy, if you turn it sideways, you get a better picture.  That's it.  Let's go talk to him.  Let's go talk to him.  And then here comes his buddy down here in the truck.  Yeah, that's his buddy right there.  Hey, buddy.  I'm like, brother, how you doing?  Just filming, and I'm trying to figure out why they're following me around here, and I can't figure it out.  Well, kind of suspicious.  Oh, that's fine.  But you know, you're about to take my picture also.  That's totally fine.  Now, whether or not you can get it, that's between you and your camera.  But that guy here has been following me around, and then you came out here to take my picture.  If you turn your phone the other way, you get a better picture.  Turn it sideways.  No, no.  That's right.  I can't.  I can't.  But I'm trying to figure out where y'all are following me.  It's like nobody here understands the rights that I have granted to me under the First Amendment.  That's what's crazy.  You know, this is all public property right here.  Yeah.  No, this is state property.  Which is public.  State property is tax funded, which makes it public.  So my tax dollars, your tax dollars pay me.  I mean, it's suspicious.  I mean, that's fine.  And again, I told the people over here to call the police.  That's fine.  I don't mind talking to them.  But you see that public utility right there?  If I want to walk all the way to that pole and record this property, I can because the city put that there.  so that city property is public.  I don't mean anybody no harm.  I don't have my gun on me.  My gun's in the car.  What's your intentions?  Huh?  Can I ask you what your intentions are?  My intentions is, I just want, again, I don't see these every day, so I stopped to take pictures of all these big oil wells here because I don't see them every day.  But it's like people are freaking out about it over a camera.  Well, it's camera touch.  But y'all have cameras all over y'all facility.  Oh, we do.  So how is my camera any different than your camera?  It isn't different, right?  I mean, that's what I'm saying.  I'm just trying to spread education.  That's all.  If I can film, so can you film.  And y'all cameras are rolling in there.  There is no harm or danger done here.  None at all.  I see all your prior notice about trespass.  I haven't breached not one of them signs.  33 feet from the center line of the road is public property.  And I also have the GIS survey of y'all's property line.  I don't plan on coming on y'all property at all.  Can I ask your name?  I'm not giving that out.  If the police officer want to come talk to me, I'll give him my name.  Maybe.  But if y'all are going to call them again, I'm not going to leave.  I'll stand right here because I don't mind talking to them.  Are they on the way?  No.  Again, I mean, if y'all want to call them, I'm totally okay with that, brother.  I have no problem with that.  I'd be more than glad to talk to them.  Thank you for coming out.  Thank you.  So this is the guy that we just talked to.  And he is following me now.  This is what he's doing.  So we're going to get his license plate and publish that since he wants to be a butthole.  This is also him and his vehicle.  South Carolina is pretty, pretty rough.  There they are.  Hey, did they call you out here?  They did.  They did?  along this public easement here.  And I was taking pictures this way, that way, and back here.  And they freaked out.  They completely freaked out about it.  And they was like, well, I'm gonna call the police.  I said, that's fine.  I don't mind talking because there's no crime being committed here.  They freaked the hell out.  These guys here.  That guy right there.  Hey, come over here, buddy.  Yeah, you.  Come here, please.  I just need you to inform him of the First Amendment that I'm allowed to record here in public, and I can be on my way.  That's all I need from you, Officer Parker.  Can you please just inform him of my right through the First Amendment, and I'm on my way.  That's all I wanted.  There's no hurt, harm, or danger done here.  I was strictly filming.  I'm sure y'all have been pumped on it because we sued Anderson a long time ago.  I don't mean any hurt, harm, or danger by it, but these guys here completely freaked the hell out, and I don't know why.  I just need him to be informed of my First Amendment right, and I can be on my way.  I'm going to come across the road because I got to get it on film that you told him for my protection.  That's all.  I told you I was coming back, buddy.  I didn't want to be rude.  I just want you to be informed and hear from someone else that I'm completely allowed to do what I'm doing.  With him taking pictures, it's not a problem.  If he goes on the property, he kind of needs a story.  At the terminal, we're on high alert anyway, so we're just making sure.  Can you actually put video on me?  I'm allowed to.  I tried to tell you that so we can be cordial.  the first time you saw me.  And I was cordial.  No, I told you that I'm allowed to do what I'm doing.  It's all on camera.  I can run it back.  It's all on camera.  You'll see it on YouTube later, I promise.  I'm allowed to do what I do.  That's all it is.  And I wanted her to come tell you because I didn't want you to think I was being a jerk about it.  It's completely legal.  And y'all have to understand that while in public, you can be fam, there's no expectation of prophecy at all, buddy.  At all.  And she can attest to that.  I tried to be cordial with you, but y'all wasted resources and called them out here for no reason at all.  There's nothing you can do about it.  No, I didn't.  I stayed on the sidewalk and you kept talking to me.  I said I couldn't hear you and I came closer to hear you.  It was a consensual conversation at that point.  So please don't try to say I came here on property.  Because I couldn't hear you, which was then a consensual conversation that you engaged in.  I came closer to hear you.  Can you go up and wait for me and you can talk?  I can't.  What can we do?  Build a brick wall.  Basically, he goes behind the gate.  I mean, he put my trespass up there.  But as far as him being out here taking pictures, videoing, I can't let him.  Okay, do your thing about it.  I'll try to tell you that.  But y'all wasted resources.  How you doing, brother?  I'm doing well, sir.  I'm all right.  Thank you.  I'm David, by the way.  Hey, David.  Thank you.  It is.  That's why I'm out here, actually.  I'm about to go jump on my bike.  I just tried to help these two gentlemen out here.  And they didn't want to understand me, so they called this sweet officer right here and wasted resources when they could have asked me the same question.  And I gave them the same answer, but they didn't want to listen to me.  So now they're on the Internet looking like fools because I tried to tell them.  And those weren't my intentions.  I tried to walk away, but then I saw her pulling up and I figured that they called and wasted her sweet time out here.  I'm sorry you had to come out here.  You're fine.  Just do me a favor.  Don't go behind me.  Oh, I won't.  I won't.  And I told them.  I have their property line on my phone.  I checked the GIS survey.  As long as I'm well within public property, it's a public utility poll.  There are no trespassers.  I know this starts on the other side of that fence.  I have no plans of breaching their property at all.  None.  Thank you.  Yes, ma'am.  Thank you for coming out, all right?  It was a pleasure having you here.  Fellas, I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, but at least now you understand, all right?  Do the same.  Thank y'all.  Thank you.  Sweet and easy.  Thank you again officer. ",
