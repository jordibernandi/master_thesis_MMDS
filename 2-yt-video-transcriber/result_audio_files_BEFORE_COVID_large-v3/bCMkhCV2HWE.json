            "text": "You need a family.  You need friends.  Like, you don't need to have all these things, but you better have most of them.  Family, friends, career, educational goals, plans for, you know, time outside of work, attention to your mental and physical health, etc.  You know, that's what life is about.  And if you don't have any of those things, well, then all you've got left is misery and suffering.  So that's a bad deal for you.  so number one specify your damn goals because how are you going to hit something if you don't know what it is that isn't going to happen?  and often people won't specify their goals too because they don't like to specify conditions for failure.  so if you keep yourself all vague and foggy which is real easy because that's just a matter of not doing as well then you don't know when you fail.  And people might say, well, I really don't want to know when I fail because that's painful.  So I'll keep myself blind about when I fail.  That's fine, except you'll fail all the time then.  You just won't know it until you've failed so badly that you're done.  And that can easily happen by the time you're 40.  So I would recommend that you don't let that happen.  So that's willful blindness, right?  You could have known, but you chose not to.  Okay, so once you get your goal structure set up, you think, okay, if I could have this life, it looks like that might be worth living, despite the fact that it's going to be, you know, anxiety-provoking and threatening, and there's going to be some suffering and loss involved in all of that, obviously.  The goal is to have a vision for your life such that, all things considered, that justifies your effort.  Okay, so then what do you do?  Well, then you turn down to the micro routine.  It's like, okay, well, this is what I'm aiming for.  How does that instantiate itself?  day to day, week to week, month to month?  And that's where something like a schedule can be unbelievably useful.  Google Calendar.  It's like, make a damn schedule and stick to it.  Okay, so what's the rule with the schedule?  It's not a bloody prison.  That's the first thing that people do wrong.  They say, well, I don't like to follow a schedule.  It's like, well, what kind of schedule are you setting up?  Well, I have to do this, then I have to do this, then I have to do this, you know, and then I just go play video games, because who wants to do all these things that I have to do?  It's like, wrong.  Set the damn schedule up so that you have the day you want.  That's the trick.  It's like, okay, I've got tomorrow.  If I was going to set it up so it was the best possible day I could have... Practically speaking.  What would it look like?  Well, then you schedule that and obviously there's a bit of responsibility.  That's going to go along with that because if you have any sense One of the things that you're going to insist upon is that at the end of the day?  You're not in worse shape than you were then at the beginning of the day, right?  That's a stupid day If you have a bunch of those in a row, you just dig yourself a hole and then you bury yourself in it.  It's like, sorry, that's just not a good strategy.  It's a bad strategy.  So maybe 20% of your day has to be responsibility and obligation, or maybe it's more than that, depending on how far behind you are.  But even that, you can ask yourself, okay, well, I've got these responsibilities.  I have to schedule the damn things in.  What's the right ratio of responsibility to reward?  And you can ask yourself that, just like you'd negotiate with someone who is working for you.  It's so... I want you to work tomorrow.  And you might say, okay, well, what are you going to do for me?  that makes it likely that I'll work for you.  Well, you could ask yourself that, you know.  Maybe you do an hour of responsibility and then you play a video game for 15 minutes.  I don't know, whatever turns your crank, man.  But, you know, you have to negotiate with yourself and not tyrannize yourself.  Like you're negotiating with someone that you care for, that you would like to be productive and have a good life.  And that's how you make the schedule.  It's like, and then you look at the day and you think, well, if I had that day, that'd be good.  Great!  You know, and you're useless and horrible, so you'll probably only hit it with about 70% accuracy, but that beats the hell out of zero.  And if you hit it even with 50% accuracy, another rule is, well, aim for 51% the next week.  Or 50.5% for God's sake.  Because you're going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and spiral you upward.  So that's one way that you can work on your conscientiousness.  It's a plan of life you'd like to have.  And you do that partly by... Referring to social norms.  that's more or less rescuing your father from the belly of the whale.  But the way other way you do that is by having a little conversation with yourself about As if you don't really know who you are because you know what you're like.  you won't do what you're told.  you won't do What you tell yourself to do.  you must have noticed that?  It's like you're a bad employee and a worse boss, and both of those work for you.  You don't know what you want to do, and then when you tell yourself what to do, you don't do it anyways.  But, you know, my point is that you have to understand that you're not your own servant, so to speak.  You're someone that you have to negotiate with.  And you're someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a good life to.  And that's hard for people, because they don't like themselves very much.  They're always like cracking the whip and then procrastinating and cracking the whip and then procrastinating.  And it's like, God, it's so boring and such a pathetic way of spending your time.  And you know what that's like because you probably waste like six hours a day.  What you do now is going to multiply its effects in the future.  And you need to know what your damn time is worth.  One of the things you should be asking yourself is, when you spend an hour, was that, well, what if I paid someone 50 bucks to have had that hour?  And if the answer is no, it's like, well, maybe you should do something else with your time.  And it depends on whether or not you think that your time's worthwhile.  But the funny thing about not assuming that is if you assume your time isn't worthwhile, what happens is you don't just sit around sort of randomly in a state of responsibility-less bliss.  What you do is you suffer existentially.  And so... ",
