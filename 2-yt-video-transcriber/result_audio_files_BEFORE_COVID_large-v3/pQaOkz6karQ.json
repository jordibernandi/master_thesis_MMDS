            "text": "I was recently in a situation that pointed out to me that we truly are in a new era when it comes to male-female relations and the awareness as it pertains to those relations.  And this observation came in part from a situation I found myself in, not a serious situation, but a situation online where there was a female who was very typical in her attitudes, her behaviors, et cetera, et cetera.  And when I made some inquiry as to what her plans were for the future and blah, blah, blah, turns out that she was either engaged or effectively in a relationship The prospective husband, much, much taller, wealthier as a business, and as is often the case, completely unremarkable in our own regard, nothing to write home about, nothing special,  etc.,  etc.  And there's another gentleman there at the time, and he seemed to be picking up on certain things.  And so I sent him a message, and I asked him, Do you know what this word means?  And I was sort of going through what one might call red pill vocabulary, things like hypergamy, MGTOW,  etc.,  etc.  And it turns out, yeah, he very much knew about these things.  Not at any great depth necessarily, but he was aware of these things.  And this encounter and a few others, just observing the Ethernet, has led me to believe that we're currently in a new phase that I might dub the covert awakening.  I say it's covert because it's not happening necessarily explicitly.  You see, back in my day, ancient as I am, no one was around to tell me certain things.  Nobody was around to give me instruction.  Nobody was around to inform me about anything.  when it came to male-female relations, your life in general, take your pick.  And so you had to figure out things on your own and figure out how you're going to proceed and what to do.  Much of that, maybe all of it, was trial and error and screwing up and trying to fix those mistakes.  And then the Internet came around and YouTube, and there were a lot of opportunities to learn, a lot of opportunities to watch, to absorb information.  The late, great Barbarossa is a great example of that, somebody who taught a lot of men and a lot of men had learned from him.  That was a phase in and of itself in a sense, essentially active learning, active absorption, active communication.  But I truly think we're in a new era of sorts, and that's the era of covert awakening, covert absorption.  Because when you think about it, the misbehavior of many women is becoming so overt and so obvious to so many people, even people that might have never even given a second thought, that they don't even need to check out videos from the Manosphere.  They don't even need to figure it out.  They don't need to make mistakes to learn from it because they're being passively fed all these things without any effort on their own.  They're becoming covertly awakened to a certain reality as it pertains to men.  And the interesting thing about this I would argue is if you're a guy of a certain age category, It's very, very likely, assuming you're not the top 20, 10% of men who presumably wouldn't necessarily have certain issues with women, although they still do oftentimes, you're just going to be aware of these things because everywhere you look, whether you turn to the side or behind or walk forward, you're going to see the same thing again and again and again.  Single mothers.  Single mothers advertising themselves on Tinder.  with their babies and children in tow, as if that were an attractive prospect to a potential suitor.  And I'm using the word suitor pretty lightly here.  One example, the double standards, the inherent risk that exists in interacting with women these days, particularly in a public setting.  And so we've evolved over time in terms of our information flow.  Back in my day, there really wasn't any.  There was no internet.  You just figured it out on your own.  And you fell on your face on your own.  You try to pick yourself up.  And then we did have an information flow embodied in the early videos of people like Barbarossa and Man, Woman, Myth.  That was an active learning period.  And now it's perfectly feasible, and I think very likely, that even men, particularly young men, who have no connection to YouTube whatsoever, don't watch any of the material, don't engage with any of the ideas in the atmosphere, just look at women and think, there's something off here.  It's not just that awakening that you might have from years ago in my generation.  There's something off here, but I can't put my finger on it.  There's something off here.  I know exactly what's off here.  I even have the right vocabulary to describe it, all passively absorbed through avenues of information that hitherto did not exist, and I'm going to act on that.  And The net result of this, I think, of this covert awakening, is that in addition to some of the other groups within the Magnosphere, there are a lot of guys who just come to the conclusion on their own that the juice is not worth the squeeze, and they're de facto MGTOW.  Without actually calling themselves that, and of course people have argued in the past, there have always been MGTOW-minded men, confirmed bachelors.  Sure, there were oddities, there were rarities.  This is a whole other can of worms in the sense that they have the lexicon, they have the power to describe it, they know what the problems are.  I've encountered a lot of these guys online in recent months who, you can tell, they're aware of certain types of behavior.  They wouldn't necessarily describe themselves as going their own way or part of the every possible demographic you could imagine.  It's not limited to one particular ethnicity or race or even one country.  Everyone who happens to be male is becoming aware of this.  And I think this is a really good thing because we do need more men who become aware of these things.  You get these situations, for example, with certain streamers on Twitch who have men who are throwing money at them nonstop in the vain hope that someday, somehow, someway, they're going to have some attention lavished back upon them, something that will never crystallize and never come true.  The more likely that's not going to be the case.  With all that said, what I said in the previous video still stands.  Women are probably not really going to care unless it's the Henry Cavill's of the world all checking out simultaneously.  And that's very, very unlikely.  But that this covert awakening that I am bearing witness to, that we all are, is going to change the lives of the men involved.  because they're not going to be throwing themselves at women, wasting their time, energy, and money.  They're not going to be pursuing relationships that, in most cases, will inevitably fail them, leading to broken marriages, broken homes, and potentially broken children.  And that's a good thing.  To have the conscience to make decisions for themselves that are not infringed upon by unrealistic expectations, by unrewarded expectations thrust upon them by other people who tell them, you need to do this.  When you ask, what do I get for it?  Nothing.  You get the pleasure of doing it for the sake of others.  And to emphatically say no to that.  It's perfectly reasonable to believe in your own sovereignty and your own goals.  But ultimately, gentlemen, the takeaway from all this, despite what everybody says, and despite even what some men in the manosphere think, is that it's never been about women, not really.  Women are catalysts.  They are instructive, if you will, if you want to be generous in describing their role.  It's about you.  It's about men.  It's about what men need to realize for themselves.  the situation they're in and what they need to do with their lives, which is ultimately their decision and up to them.  That's what this is about.  A catalyst is just a catalyst.  It's not the end result.  The end result is you and what you decide to do with your life. ",
