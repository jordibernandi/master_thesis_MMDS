            "text": "So earlier this month, Chris Pratt was on the Colbert Report talking about his faith and how awesome God is and spirituality and shit like that.  But then the lesbian actress Ellen Page wasn't fucking having it.  She watched it and then she tweeted out, Okay.  Um, but his church is infamously anti-LGBTQ, so maybe address that too?  And then she got like 100,000 likes from her fans.  They were like, you tell him, girl!  But then Chris Pratt was like, what the fuck did this bitch just say to me?  I'm the fucking Star-Lord, you mouthy cunt!  And then he got on the internet and furiously responded, It has recently been suggested that I belong to a church which hates a certain group of people and is infamously anti-LGBTQ.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone.  And then Ellen Page read that and she was like, motherfucker, are you out of your goddamn mind?  And she tweeted, if you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don't be surprised if someone simply wonders why it's not addressed.  Being anti-LGBTQ is wrong.  There aren't two sides.  The damage it causes is severe.  Full stop.  Sending love to all.  And then this time, she got over 200,000 likes.  Folks was like, kick his ass, Ellen.  And look, folks, before I continue, let me say this.  I have absolutely nothing against Chris Pratt.  In fact, it's just the opposite.  I've been a big fan of Chris Pratt for a long time.  I first saw him on Parks and Recreations and thought he was incredibly fucking funny and charismatic.  I even publicly said in the very off chance they ever make a movie about my life, I want Chris Pratt to play me.  I mean, obviously, I would want to play myself, but if that wasn't an option for some reason, then he's a solid, slightly less handsome alternative.  So as someone who has absolutely nothing against either one of these actors, I decided to look into it and see which one of these guys were telling the truth.  And it turns out that when Chris Pratt says nothing could be further from the truth that his church is infamously anti-LGBTQ, He's full of fucking shit.  Sorry, Chris, but you're wrong.  The truth is, you absolutely do support a church that is anti-LGBTQ.  But the thing is, it's even fucking worse than that.  So let me break it down and explain exactly why he absolutely should be called out for supporting this bullshit.  So first off, Chris Pratt belongs to the same church Justin Bieber does.  It's called Hillsong, and it's one of the most embarrassing places on earth.  Like seriously, this church is so dorky and corny, it's the very definition of cringe.  It's literally so cringey, it's almost hard to watch.  Let me remind you guys of what I'm talking about.  We're gonna have fun in the church tonight, is that alright?  I'm asking you, Heavenly Father, enlarge my border.  Enlarge my border.  God, you can do it.  Take my reach and enlarge my border.  Will you put your hand on my border?  Take my border.  Flip it out there, God.  Out there.  And I'm going to tell them, take my border.  Enlarge my border.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Was that embarrassing to watch?  Yeah!  So anyway, this is the silly ass church we're talking about.  But most people, including probably Chris Pratt, does not know the history behind this church.  So basically, Hillsong Church started off in Australia.  And it became hugely popular.  It's one of the biggest mega churches in Australia.  So they decided to franchise this thing out all over the world.  Basically, you can think about it sort of like a fast food restaurant.  Pretend somebody opened a fast food restaurant in Australia that became really popular, so they decided to open up other branches in other parts of the world, and all the other branches have to kick up a percentage of their profits to the main branch.  And so Chris Pratt and Justin Bieber and a bunch of other celebrities go to the branch in New York.  But the actual history of this church is incredibly fucking evil.  It's just like the Catholic Church and so many other churches out there.  At the very top, you have these incredibly fucking evil shitheads running everything.  So the forerunner of Hillsong Church was founded in 1977 by Australian pastor Frank Houston.  The guy that's currently at the very top of the pyramid at Hillsong, the guy that runs everything, is a guy whose name is Brian Houston.  He's the son of Frank Houston.  And him and his wife worked for his dad at his dad's church until 1983.  Then Brian Houston and his wife left to form their own church.  They called their new church Hills Christian Life Center.  And then in 1999, they merged the two churches and they formed Hillsong Church.  Frank, the father, retired and Brian, his son, took over the whole thing and continues to run it to this day.  So if you guys have been paying attention at all to how Christian churches work, the next part of this won't surprise you at all.  It turns out that the Father Frank had been molesting boys for decades.  That's right, folks.  Hillsong Church was co-founded by a child rapist.  I know, I know.  You're all fucking shocked.  But wait, there's more.  So a royal commission was formed to investigate the allegations that Frank Houston molested nine boys.  The commission heard from one victim they called AHA.  who testified that in 1969-1970, when he was a seven-year-old boy, Frank stayed with his family in Australia.  AHA said that after church meetings, Frank would hug and kiss me in front of other people and would sometimes go into an office alone where he would feel between my legs.  AHA said, Frank would creep into my room late at night nearly every night of the week and molest him.  I would be petrified and I would just lay there very still.  I could not speak while this was happening and it felt like I could not breathe.  I'm not sure how long he would stay in the room with me, but it felt like forever.  And apparently this fucking piece of shit molested this boy for years until this kid finally reached puberty and then he was too old for Frank and so Frank moved on to some other kid he could molest.  This motherfucker.  But wait, wait, wait.  If you're not pissed yet, you're about to be.  So Frank's son, Brian, the guy who right now is in charge of Hillsong Church, the guy who all this money is kicked up to, took some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he was raking in from his megachurch and decided to pay off these victims to keep them quiet and cover all this shit up.  So this kid who was molested, AHA, testified that Brian Houston called him and told him, you know, it's your fault.  all of this happened.  You tempted my father.  The motherfucker that runs Hillstone Church literally blamed a kid for being molested.  Chris Pratt, dude, this is the motherfucker you're supporting.  When you go out to your movie roles and you earn your millions of dollars and you go pay your 10% tithe, this is the motherfucker that's getting kicked up to.  You are literally funding this guy.  Hillsong Church is one of these churches that preaches prosperity gospel.  Basically, they just ignore everything Jesus said about giving your shit away from the poor and how rich people can't get into heaven.  And instead, they teach that God wants everybody to be as rich as they fucking possibly can be.  And this church makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  And apparently, from what's being reported, they only give 5% of it to charity.  5 fucking percent.  This is what all of you celebrity assholes are supporting.  And this guy Frank Houston, who molested all these boys, literally drew a pension from Hillsong Church until the day he died.  You motherfuckers literally paid this pedophile child rapist to the fucking day he died.  So let me just stop right here for a second to say, fuck you guys for this.  Fuck you for rewarding this goddamn pedophile.  His son Brian, the guy who currently runs Hillsong, covered all this shit up.  Nothing fucking happened to his pedophile father, and he fucking made bank until the goddamn day he died.  In fact, this guy, Brian Houston, the guy that currently runs Hillsong Church, wrote a book where apparently he seemed to conflate homosexuality with pedophilia.  He said, I think my father was a homosexual, a closeted homosexual.  I know psychiatrists, but I think whatever frustrations he had, he took out on children.  Just like an evil dirty homo would do.  Which brings us to the topic at hand, the gay situation.  And I'm sure none of you will be surprised that these pedophile covering up motherfuckers are anti-LGTBQ.  Just like fucking Ellen Page said they are.  So let's look at several examples of this, shall we?  If you went to Hillsong Church and you told them you were gay, they would send you to gay conversion therapy.  Hillsong outsourced their gay conversion therapy to an organization called Living Water, who are one of the most notorious gay conversion therapy organizations to ever exist.  Several people have now gone public and explained just how scarred they were left by the horrors of this anti-gay conversion therapy.  Feel free to go read some of these stories for yourself.  It's really heart-wrenching.  To Hillsong's credit, they discontinued gay conversion therapy in 2011.  But that definitely wasn't the end of their anti-LGBTQ bullshit.  Hillsong continues to remove anybody they found out who was gay from leadership roles.  Homosexuals are not allowed to have any kind of leadership roles in Hillsong Church.  One gay dude reported that he was removed from his position working at a children's ministry.  Another guy came forward and said when they found out he was gay, they would not even let him be an usher.  He wasn't even allowed to serve cups of coffee or help direct traffic in the parking lot.  And when they found out the leader of their choir Josh Canfield was marrying his longtime partner, Reed Kelly.  They sacked his ass immediately.  Brian Houston, the pedophile covering up motherfucker that runs Hillsong Church, put out a statement that said, I wish to correct the reports that Hillsong Church has an openly gay couple directing a choir at our New York City campus.  Hillsong's position on homosexuality and gay marriage has not changed and is consistent with Scripture.  As I have stated previously, I believe the writings of Paul are clear on this subject.  Several months ago, when one of our choir directors made an unexpected public statement regarding his engagement to a man who sometimes sang in the choir, it was a complete surprise to us as well.  It is my understanding that they have not been involved in an active leadership or ministry role since.  And then, of course, they do what they always do.  But don't get us wrong, dude.  We fucking love them.  We love them to death.  If you fucking love them so much, why do you treat them like second class citizens?  Why don't you treat them exactly like everybody else?  Why don't you treat them as equals?  Answer?  Because you're an anti-gay fuckhead.  And as some of you may remember, Australia recently held a referendum to vote to see if the people wanted to allow gay marriage in Australia.  And of course, this pedophile covering up motherfucker, the guy who runs Hillsong Church, Brian Houston, released a statement trying to encourage people not to vote for gay marriage.  Houston is unequivocal with his views on the issues stating he believes the Bible is clear that marriage is between a man and a woman.  And there have been lots of blog posts and articles from other gay people explaining exactly why they left Hillsong Church.  I mean, sure, they'll let gay people come to the church and they'll be nice to you and everything.  They want your fucking money.  But if you're gay and you want to be treated like an equal and put in a position of authority, Not gonna happen.  So sorry, Chris Pratt, but when you say that there's nothing further from the truth that your church is anti-LGBTQ, you're full of fucking shit, dude.  And you absolutely deserve to be called out for this.  You work in Hollywood, dude, on movies.  There's no doubt that you're surrounded by gay people all the fucking time.  How do you think they feel knowing that you earn money and then you go give it to these anti-gay bigot motherfuckers?  And these people like Pratt, they always want to say, well, that's just my faith, man.  You got to respect my faith.  Bullshit.  I don't have to respect that shit.  I don't have to respect you giving money to these motherfuckers because these motherfuckers you're funding are actually doing real harm in the real world.  And your faith doesn't shield you from criticism.  Your faith doesn't shield you from the harm of your actions.  You are not an ally to LGBTQ people.  You are an enemy.  You are literally funding the people who are trying to oppress them.  But here's the thing.  Chris Pratt is not the only one who deserves to be called out for this bullshit.  So do people like Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez.  Kourtney Kardashian, Hailey Baldwin, Vanessa Hudgens, Hailey Steinfeld, Cody Simpson, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Nick Jonas.  All you motherfuckers should be ashamed of yourself and you deserve to take shit for this.  You're all fucked.  fucking part of the problem.  And obviously Hillsong Church is not the only church that's anti-LGBTQ.  Fucking.  most churches are.  And it's far past time that we stop letting people use their faith as a shield to hide behind.  It's time that we start calling all of these people that support this shit out.  So thank you Ellen Page for standing up and being brave and saying something.  I still like Chris Pratt, but somebody needs to stand up and tell him the truth.  And maybe, just maybe we'll shock some sensitive of these people and they'll change their ways.  I guess that's up to them.  Hopefully somebody will send this video to some of these people and they can learn the truth.  Hopefully they will realize the harm they're causing.  Hopefully they'll change their ways and stop supporting this anti-LGBQ bullshit and instead embrace logic.  Fuck yes.
