The truth is, she wasn't being anti-Semitic.  She was stating a fact.  Here's five times AIPAC insiders got caught admitting how they control American politics with money.  Number one, leaked memos.  It's important to understand that even though APEC spends millions on lobbying Congress, it does not contribute directly to political campaign contributions.  It would be illegal.  But APEC does influence campaign contributions indirectly, like all powerful lobbies.  through the organization and bundling of individual donations from AIPAC members and dozens of pro-Israel PACs who often take cues from AIPAC, which we know from leaked documents sent to the Washington Post in 60 Minutes.
