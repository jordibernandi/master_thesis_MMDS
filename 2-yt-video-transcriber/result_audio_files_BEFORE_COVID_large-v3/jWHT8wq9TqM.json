            "text": "June 26, 2019.  Guys, you're looking at what's called our magnetopause.  And this is a model that's created by a group of satellites.  And in the very center of the black circle in the white circle represents Earth.  The lighter side represents the daylight side of the Earth or the sun facing side.  The white line with orange and yellow, guys, that's our magnetopause.  It's part of the Earth's shields.  Again, this is the direction the energy is coming from.  Our shields are hitting that.  You can see the glow.  Notice your timestamp.  Something happened today, guys.  Did anybody feel that disturbance in the force?  But our shields collapsed and they collapsed hard around 11 p.m.  or 11 a.m.  universal time.  What's your time stamp at the top?  9, 47, 10.  And you notice you're getting about an image about every three to four minutes.  And what all of a sudden there's a 26 or 27 minute gap in the time.  Again, 1202 right there, 1206, you're going back to the regular time.  Then at that point, the entire magnetopause is bent out of shape.  Something came in.  It was not solar wind.  We'll look at those charts.  They're not expecting any solar wind.  And as a matter of fact, it was very low.  And if you're going through the day, it bounces back out.  Everything looks fine.  But if we go back to that time, notice at 1113, it goes to 1117.  So about every four minutes, we're getting data until that collapse point.  And then you've got over 20 minutes from 1150 right there, 1121.  So almost 30 minutes of no data.  Then we see that the shields have collapsed into that white band, guys.  That is a group of satellites called the GOES-14, 13, and the comms out of South Korea.  That's what you're seeing orbiting.  That's what is picking up this energy.  But this... wave of energy collapsed our magnetopause all the way into the satellite band.  look at that starts to pop out.  but look at the energy that's being displaced behind the earth.  that's plasma feed and we'll look at that in another model.  But again, guys, that's a tremendous amount of collapse.  Normally about 12.  You see that scale on the bottom?  5, 10, 15, bottom right.  About 12 is the average, what's called a standoff point.  We're going to look at the same thing from a different model a little further back.  And again, the sun is to the right of the image.  You can see all the arrows from the right sending that energy.  The darker blues is plasma that's created and discharged behind the planet.  But suddenly, again, same time stamp, you're going from 1121, you got about a 30-minute gap, 1150, guys, and you see that collapse.  Watch the amount of energy that's displaced, not only behind the Earth in this plasma field, but to both the top and bottom.  Guys, and when it did that, as you can see these lines or magnetic lines behind the planet, guys, are wavy.  They kind of go in and out.  But when that thing hit, it was a straight line.  But look at this.  During that period of time, there were no solar wind speed peaks.  As a matter of fact, after 12 p.m.  universal time, look at this, it flattened out.  Whatever that wave of energy that crossed our planet, was it blinked out any of that solar wind?  it just again flatlined it.  and if we go back to the 26th looking at what's called soho lasco c3 guys it's a satellite that gives us an earth-facing perspective of our sun.  we'll ride it wind it through.  up until today the only thing that happened there was no coronal mass ejection solar flares or anything.  we saw a comet hit the sun notice in the bottom right coming up under right there And it goes in and strikes a sun, is dissipated, absorbed.  A lot of times when you see that, you will see a reaction from the sun, a solar flare, coronal mass ejection, nothing.  And if you look at today's space weather, it said the next solar wind stream, Earth is passing through a relative void.  Between streams of solar wind, nothing happening.  The next gust of gaseous material from the sun is expected to arrive on July 3rd and 4th, and that's from a coronal hole.  That's an opening or hole in the surface of the sun that allows a straight blast of solar wind to head towards our planet.  So guys, I don't know exactly what that was.  It was not solar wind.  You saw the charts.  You see this information.  There was no coronal mass ejections.  we have seen these waves of energy come in before.  could it be part of a gamma ray burst?  those have been being picked up lately as a matter of fact In.  I think it was in Tibet, guys, we have a. there's a giant scientific station there in Tibet.  And they I think Chinese have something to do with possibly Russia.  But they measure gamma ray burst and they've got this large area of all these sensors spread out at high elevations with clear skies all the time.  And they can measure this coming in, so it would be interesting.  But not too long ago, they did a letter, and they turned it into the science establishments around the world.  where they measured the largest gamma ray burst ever recorded, and it came from the Crab Nebula.  That constellation, guys, and it was over 100 tera electron volts registered on those sensors there on the ground.  Remember, CERN gets up to about 13 tera electron volts at extremely high energy.  We're dealing with 100 teralutron volts, 100, or that's 1,000 trillion electron volts, guys, that passed through our atmosphere and struck this center station in Tibet.  Guys, we're watching it.  Again, not sure what happened.  Thank you for the support.  Don't forget, we've got a lot of specials on our survival food and water filters on our website at bpearthwatch.com.  My Patriot Supply is moving to a larger warehouse, so they put some good deals out.  We appreciate it, guys.  It's a heads up.  Be safe. ",
