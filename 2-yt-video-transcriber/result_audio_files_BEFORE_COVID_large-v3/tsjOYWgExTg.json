His YouTube channel, Adapt 2030, is very popular, and I've been a guest on his program.  He's been a guest on mine numerous times.  David, thanks so much for joining me here on Northwest Liberty News, my friend.  Good to see you again.  I just read a report, David, on Zero Hedge.  where there were a swarm of about 700 earthquakes, I think, in California.  There's actual tar.  There's tar seeping out of the ground and coming from... That's crazy. ",

He's like, it's light now, but you seem to be getting it now.  So get prepared.  So he was kind of walking me through what to expect.  And he's like, just go full throttle into it because if you're going to back off or show any kind of weakness, they're going to try to take you down.  It's like you go 100% or you don't go, period.  And he lost his career because of what he's talked about, these volcanic eruptions coming with this grand solar minimum.  And he was taken down hard for these connections of cosmic rays, volcanic eruptions, food crop losses, and what to expect when we get major earthquakes in America.  Why is the government not talking about disruption of at least pipelines in these massive quakes? ",

We're expecting a... the worst one that you thought.  So now we've got tar already coming out of the ground and we haven't even really hit the real bad part, quote unquote, of the grand solar minimum.  David, earthquakes are going to pick up, volcanoes are going to pick up, tar coming out of the ground is likely going to pick up.  what kind of things can people expect david as far as you know geographically speaking like i just said you know we're talking about i don't know how much snow in the in the in the in the rockies in the sierras i mean record snowfalls hundred over 100 feet of snow coming down.  what type of stuff can we expect here coming up david in the next 10 12 15 years?  what's the landscape going to look?

            "text": "like 2 billion less people at the minimum.  And we were told snow would be a thing of the past and our children would never know what snow was.  And we're getting, you know, four and a half times the average snowfall in Colorado, double the amount of average snowfall in the Sierra Nevadas.  Look at the amount of rain coming down.  It's like five times more rain across the growing zones of the United States.  And Eastern Europe seems to be getting well hit with an enormous amount of rain as well.  And we saw this record snowpack across Italy and Austria.  So it's not just exclusively limited to the United States with these amazing amounts of precipitation in the atmosphere.  I am actually going out on the fence here saying, we're going to get into biblical flooding.  Something that you hear about in the Numa Iyilish or something, when you're reading it, when you're going far back in texts, when you're looking back in historical accounts of water oozing from the earth, flooding things, not just from the above ground water.  But we're going so deep into a society reset here that we really should be talking about this in terms of solutions.  I would have been... I want to clarify my statement here.  Please let me clarify this and just don't jump off and take it out of context.  If the governments of the world would have warned us And we would have said, all right, let's all work together.  And we've got a grand solar minimum coming.  And this is coming now.  And it'll be here in four, five, six years, whatever.  Learn how to grow food and organize community groups to grow food and learn how to store food, share it, pack it, whatever.  And work in your communities to get ready for these changes.  I would have said something very, very different than I'm about to say right now.  The amount of volcanic activity on this planet is going to uptick.  It's already starting, and this is sort of what you consider year number one.  The lead-in to this was pretty much started in 2015-16, and it was a slow trickle, but now it's actually the faucet's opening.  Year number one of the crop losses is occurring this year.  These volcanic eruptions are going to continue to uptick in ferocity.  So we're looking at Sinabung and Agung down in Indonesia, pumping ash up 75, almost 80,000 feet in the air already.  If you see a VEI, let's say six or seven eruption, you're going to need to stop at that minute what you are doing in your life and withdraw as much money as you can from the bank and go buy as much food as you can.  I know it's selfish to say that and it might seem like, oh, you're telling me to go hoard and buy the store out.  Yes, I am.  If the governments would have told us to work together, that means we would have been together.  There's been no warning, so you're absolutely on your own.  There's going to be nobody to help you during this time.  We have had no help from the governments to this point.  We expect none from this point.  You are on your own.  So if you see a huge volcanic eruption that's going to pump ash up 120,000 feet, that's going to disrupt global agriculture the next year, You need to run as fast as you can to that store and buy anything you can.  That's seeds like I have behind me here that can be turned into sprouts food, but you can also eat it.  Anything long-term food storage like you got with all the water filtration, you need to buy everything immediately.  Baking soda, medicines, candles, fuels, lighters, anything you can.  You spend everything you have in your account to go buy food at that point.  You're on your own.  And by that next year, cannibalism is going to sweep our planet.  I tell you what, nobody's ready for this.  And before, I was thinking maybe there's some chance we're going to sort of come through this.  No, we're going to go down so hard that I really believe in my ultimate end of things on how low it can go.  You don't want to hear my projections, but it's far more than 2 billion people that aren't going to make it through.  The governments have not warned any of us.  And it's just about more control and more silencing of the message, more censorship.  And it's just about... keeping us as unprepared as we can possibly be during this time.  So for me to come out and say, go buy whatever you can as you see a VEI7 eruption, you're going to have to save yourself because you're the only one that can save yourself.  You alone to protect your families.  That's it.  The government ain't going to help you.  And everybody's going to come and try to take what you have.  So you're going to have to shoot first, shoot second, shoot third, and then maybe ask a question later because that's the world we're going into because nobody's talking about these problems.  And that tar oozing out of city streets in California.  That should be a wake-up call.  That's not making any news.  Made regional news.  Made local news because they had to talk about tar oozing out of the streets.  What about these swarms of earthquakes?  All the Cascadia Range goes off during every grand solar minimum.  You've got to read John Casey's book, Upheaval.  What happens if we get a quake on the Madrid zone?  All of our pipes go down. ",

Good interview.  Yeah, it was a really, really good interview.  You'll find out, folks, that if this New Madrid fault line goes... All of the pipes, all of the resource pipes, the oil, natural gas, anything that goes up to the East Coast is all through pipelines.  And all those pipelines could potentially be ruptured, most likely will be.  And if I remember correctly, David, all the bridges are going to be so unstable and in such disrepair that people are going to have to actually drive almost all the way up.  Truck drivers are going to have to go all the way to Chicago, basically, to get to a bridge that they feel comfortable enough to cross to get back all the way with supplies back out east.  If something like that happens, if it happens in the winter, the people out east are in some really, really, really perilous times, David.  Really perilous times. ",

You know, something's going to come up to solve our problem.  So if the bridges go down and I had a boat, I would sure be offering rides across the rivers as a new kind of, you know, business model, whether it be carrying goods, everything would slow down to a trickle.  And, you know, that book, if there is such a thing, they're looking at 90% loss of all population in North America if this happens.  You've got to realize those numbers are stupendous.  And this is not even from John Casey.  This is what FEMA had done studies on and our own governments have done studies on.  If we get a quake like this, and I shouldn't say it won't include Mexico so much, but they will be devastated as well with the lack of supplies going down there.  But they were talking specifically in America and Canada, it will be a 90% loss of all populations during this time. ",

And you got, look where all these quakes are happening.  You got quakes in Ohio this week.  You got quakes in North Carolina.  You got, like, I would also call it a swarm in Tennessee because they're getting quakes all up near Oak Ridge and all kind of places.  you just never have quakes.  And then we got all these massive 7,000-something quakes over in California.  Definitely magma is rumbling, and there's definitely tectonic activity there.  In different locales, you've got quakes in the Arctic Circle.  I mean, something is waking up on the planet.  And, you know, now we're really starting to get in.  With this bottom of this solar minimum here on the 11-year cycle, it's going to take a little bit to kickstart out of that.  And then, you know, this next solar cycle predicted by John Casey, Dr.  Abuzimatov at the Pocobo Observatory, and... Valentina Zarkova, they're talking about 50 sunspots average or less, but the whole other mainstream crew is saying it's going to be 120 again.  Well, that's a huge difference.  50, our society starts to crumble.  120, it's sort of status quo and we still lose crops.  Why is nobody really talking about what the possibility could be?  Why do these voices have to be silenced if you're going against the mainstream narrative?  I want the conversation on both sides because it's very possible it's going to happen.  And if it's not going to happen right now, we're going to have the same exact conversation 11 years from now in solar cycle 26 when everybody predicts low solar activity.  So why aren't we talking about it now?  This is the whole thing that frightens me.  There's a discerned effort to silence this.  They want as much loss of life as they can possibly get.  They're absolutely, permanently silencing voices that want to bring out these, why are we not talking about this? ",
