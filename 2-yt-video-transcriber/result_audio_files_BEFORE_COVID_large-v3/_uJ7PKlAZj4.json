            "text": "George Bush was bringing the cocaine with Oliver North into Arkansas.  Clinton was providing the state security.  And you asked about what was the attraction for these elites with Epstein.  Clinton's not a hard one to hook.  If you go back then, he was hammering the cocaine himself.  His brother Roger was arrested for doing a cocaine transaction.  And on the record, he said... Brother Bill's got a nose like a vacuum cleaner for this stuff.  There were multiple sexual assault cases settled out of court from around the time Bill Clinton was governor.  He was a sleazeball from the go.  That's why the CIA was bringing it into Arkansas.  They knew they could manipulate him like that.  And these testimonies are not coming from conspiracy theorists.  These testimonies are coming from the state police, the Arkansas state police, the people who are still alive, not in the Clinton body count, because some of them ended up in the Clinton body count.

If you look at the people who were working for them, so they were the state police, the Arkansas state police, were driving Bill around so he could have his sexual liaisons with various women.  Some women, he was promising them jobs, telling them to come to hotels, and that's where alleged sexual assaults occurred that ended up in out-of-court settlements.  These guys, the state police, were taking him to the Mainer, Arkansas area, where the state police were protecting the cocaine coming in.  So this was highly sensitive information back at that time.  Some of them who were blowing the whistle early on, horrific things happened to them, horrific things happened to.  Larry Nichols was an insider who was working for ADFA, which was the Arkansas State Development Finance Authority.  And he said when he blew the whistle, his life was threatened multiple times.  Even to this day, he fears for his life.  And he said they were washing through ADFA, which Bill Clinton had advertised as an entity that was going to boost employment for Arkansas.  Larry Nichols said they were washing up to $100 million worth a month of cocaine money that was coming in. ",
