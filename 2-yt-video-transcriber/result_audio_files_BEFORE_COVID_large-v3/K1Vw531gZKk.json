He was arrested for assaulting police officers at an Antifa rally and threw tomatoes at President Trump, though it should come as no surprise that he missed by a mile.  You play ball like a girl!  Now during a recent change of my mind at Google headquarters in Austin, I also took to Facebook posting our location publicly and calling for others to milkshake me.

He's the teacher who labeled me a Nazi and falsely spread a rumor about me threatening his child because he's a compulsive liar on the spectrum.
