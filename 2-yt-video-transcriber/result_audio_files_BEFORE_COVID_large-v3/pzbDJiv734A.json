But for a Christian, I mean, who's a prophet?  Can our viewers out there, can our viewers say, wait a minute now, I'm not a prophet.  How do I move in that?  Who has the gift of prophecy? ",

So in one of the chapters in this book, The Prophet, I talk about four different levels in prophetic ministry.  So there's the occasional gift of prophecy.  a consistent operation.  Then there's the ministry of a prophecy, and then there's the office of a prophet, which is in Ephesians 4, verse 11.  And so the gift of prophecy, 1 Corinthians 14, 1, is for edification, exhortation, and comfort.  But it does not include correction or direction.  But the office of a prophet is different.  It includes that, but it's more governmental.  Ephesians 2.20, the church is built on the foundation of Jesus and apostles and prophets.  And so then prophets are equippers to help others like pastors are equippers to help others do what they're gifted in.  Prophets are equippers who help others do what they are gifted in, which is primarily how to hear God's voice today. ",

And I think of myself, because this is kind of where, in many ways, I pray for people at our church.  People come to the altar quite often.  I get a picture or something and I'll share that with them.  There's not a lot of interpretation that I'm doing with that, but I'm saying this is something for you.  So that kind of is that level.  Could you just speak a little bit more about that? ",

And so sometimes those are little snapshot pictures, but now you were using a reference like in personal ministry to more of the visionary vision.  And so that would be like a seer realm, visions, experiences of that nature.  But then there is the bubbling up gift of prophecy that is going to like give a word of encouragement, a word perhaps of consolation or comfort.  And so, yes, that is what you and many are operating in personal ministry, but you can also be a prophetic intercessor.  And so it isn't as much ministering to people.  You're taking your revelation.  You're praying back to God.  You're praying through the prophecies of the Word of God that have not fully been met and fulfilled yet, like Simeon and Anna in Luke chapter 2.  And Anna was called a prophetess, but it doesn't ever give one account of her actually personally prophesying. ",

Creating a prophetic culture is worship.  And so it's like, I hear the Lord when I get in worship services.  But I don't hear God only in worship services because there is the lifestyle.  So if you want to increase in a lifestyle of revelation, that's the prophetic, by the way, then enter into worship.  We enter into his gates with, what is it? ",
