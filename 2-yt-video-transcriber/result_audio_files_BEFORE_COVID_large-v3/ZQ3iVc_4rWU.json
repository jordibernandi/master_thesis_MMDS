They're not taking the video down.  Instagram also said, but Facebook will put a little note under it that says this is a false video or that this is fake.  Instagram, on the other hand, will not put that notice.  And they said that we treat this video, we treat this content the same way that we treat all misinformation on Instagram.  If third-party fact-checkers mark it as false, we will filter it from Instagram's recommendation services.  like explore and hashtag pages.  That's from a spokesperson at Instagram.
