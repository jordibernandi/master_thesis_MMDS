            "text": "This is a video that I was supposed to do part two to the World War III video, which was the last video.  And I started going through my Watch Later videos, and this one's been in there for a while.  And the Spirit jumped on me to do this one so I can delete it.  That's how I go through the list.  And I've been sitting on this one for a while, so through the Spirit, this is the video that... that I decided to do and it's called the global decline of white people.  and first we're gonna address that title.  there's no such thing as white people.  they subscribe that name to themselves.  in 1681 in Virginia.  they are the red Hebrew Edomites the children the sons and daughters of Esau Edom.  When you're reading the Holy Scriptures and it says the first came out red all over.  The only infants that are born red and pink are Edomite children, so-called Caucasians.  So even when he's telling the truth about the decline of his people, they still can't admit who they are.  And they're not going to admit who they are until they're forced to.  Until, well, some of them are realizing it now.  They know it.  But it's not until the Lord takes them completely down and take them out of power and they're put into chains and put into subjection and begin to serve the thousand year punishment as the Bible says.  So with that being said, I'm going to read a scripture and then let the video play and then read more scripture.  And I'm going to start in Isaiah, the 14th chapter at verse 10.  I asked him to start at verse 9 and it reads, Held from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming.  It stirth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth.  It hath raised up from her throne all the kings of the nations.  And they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou become as weak as we?  Art thou become like unto us?  So the nations of the world are raising up against Esau Edom, the so-called white man.  They're calling him out and pointing out his history.  Which is something that this guy is in denial of.  Saying that it's the shaming, you know, of white people.  Well, you Edomites, you so-called white people, do not acknowledge how you got into power.  And you got into power by rape, robbery, and murder.  The theft of lands, the theft of heritage.  Worldwide, every place that you are, because your home is Mount Seir in Edom, which is south of Israel.  But you're not there.  You're everywhere else.  And everything you've got, you've gotten through rape, robbery and murder, through the spoiling of nations and the spoiling of heritage.  The nations of the earth.  When you read Genesis, the 10th chapter.  All right.  The 18 nations that are on the earth that are still here.  None of them are called by those names that were given to them from on high.  The so-called white man renamed all the nations, mainly to hide himself, which is why he self-prescribed the name white unto himself.  Let's continue in the scripture.  Thy pup is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy vows.  a worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning?  How art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations?  But thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven and will exalt my throne above the stars of power.  And I will sit upon the mount of the congregation in the size of the north, that being America.  And I will ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high, their flight.  the space stations, the satellites.  Yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the size of the pit.  They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider saying, is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake the kingdoms? ",

            "text": "Before I move on to the statistical analysis part of this video, which shows the decline of the worldwide population, I thought I would just add a few comments.  I know we have heard the following many times before, but it is true that when a white person expresses interest in their culture and their heritage, they are automatically seen as racists.  but any other race can express their cultural pride and that is actively encouraged.  What a sad and pathetic situation we have today.  While all non-whites are taught to be proud of who they are, white people are given a guilt trip and told they should be ashamed.  This double standards is quite breathtaking, and is effectively destroying white society and culture, all in the name of social progress.  I just wish to conclude this part of the video with a comment.  I read to another video on this particular subject.  White nations led the world in legalizing the right for women to have an abortion, and now they seem rather perplexed and confused.  or why the birth rate is much lower than the replacement level for white people.

            "text": "That's already happening.  They're not going to make it to 2060.  That is a joke.  They're down in every state in America.  So one of the things that Esau Edom, the red Hebrew Edomite does is lie on pie charts, numbers and figures.  The figures have already come out and they're past the point of no return, of regenerating and replenishing themselves.  They cannot replace themselves.  That's how few of them there is.  In every state in America, they're in the negative as far as children being born.  So by the time 2060 comes, they will be heavy in slavery and chains.  The curses in the Bible that fell. ",
