Whatever I can see out here.  It's interesting.  Have a nice day.  Oh no, we're just out here videoing.  Rolling in reverse.  I'm going to go ahead and put it on pause for a minute, guys.  Hold on.  What?  Oh, well, they come up, check me out.  One guy did and drove back in there.  And he just asked if he could help, if he could have a name.  I said no, and he drove back in there.  So he went to tell them.  Now, the property line PP showed us is basically, I think, this road here or somewhere around in here.  Private, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  That's what PP was saying.  Yeah.  And I think we can walk up this gate, this fence, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the guy, he put it in reverse and drove all the way back.  Yeah, I already got up close up there.  There's nothing right here that says don't enter.  Yeah.  If it's their property, it's their property.  It's just the way it is.  Nothing you can do about it.  Yeah, I would kind of think that's common sense that the line is right here.  Yeah.  We're just getting video.  Yeah.  Well, you know, pretty much anywhere in the country, private property is respected as their property, so you've got to respect that.  If you want your rights respected, you've got to respect theirs.  Be easy to find, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to take a little stroll.  Pretty hot.  It is hot and humid.  What's it, about 98?  Can't do it.  Comes a car.  Hey guys, I'm going to pause the camera.  Not now, maybe later up there.  I'll know maybe later.  Got the folks out, huh?  It's good.  Keep an eye on us.  It's all they need to do.  No need to panic.  Yeah.  Great Pains Correctional Facility out here in Hinton, Oklahoma.  And they're keeping an eye on us.  But so far, they are respecting our rights to film this private prison.  So... I hear whistles being blown.  I don't know if you can hear it, but I hear whistles.  Are you serious right now?  I was leaving.  I was asking you a question.  Okay, I'm leaving right now.  When I asked you about the first part, I was asking you a question.  I thought we were having an important conversation.  Yeah, we do leave when we're asked.  We haven't been asked yet.  At least I haven't been asked yet.  Okay, I'm going to ask you to leave.  Do you want to leave?  Yeah, do you have the keys to the car?  May I get the keys to the car, sir?  From his pocket?  Okay.  Where is he going?  I told you to leave. ",

It looks like they might be adjusting his cuffs.  Looks like they're letting him go.  Let's get up here and see what the hell happened.  They're laughing and joking.  We were leaving.  I'm hot.  I'm tired.  I'm ready to go.  It's hot out here.  Yeah.  So what was all that about?  I mean, you were arrested.  I've got you right here. ",
