It's Chris James, your faithful host of the Not Even a Show.  As many of you know, I've been trapped in the cartoon realm for the past month or so.  And it actually turns out that this place, Mergestonia, that I thought was a brand new country that I was physically living in, is actually somewhere that exists only in my mind, a prison of sorts that I've been trapped in by a paranormal figure named Graft.  Now, I'm terrified every single day.  I wake up sweating and crying, and I have absolutely no idea what's real and what's not real.  And my life is truly a nightmare, and I need somebody, anybody to save me and help me and get me back to the world that I once knew.  But, but... We have a great episode for you this week as the Fat Master calls the Dave Elswick Show.  Plus, we call a new program called The Right Chicks as well as our friend from last week, Jamie.  First, though.  we've got a real treat for you pretties.  That's right, the biggest guest we've ever had on the Not Even a Show.  This is a huge get.  You're not even gonna believe it, although I guess you probably saw it in the description and most likely the title, but you're about to see it for real right now, and it is Gorka. ",
