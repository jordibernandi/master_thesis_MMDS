            "text": "All right, everyone.  If I sound a little bit odd, it's because I'm still kind of stuffed up.  I don't feel under the weather.  I actually feel perfectly fine.  I feel perfectly normal.  But my throat's a little bit swollen, just a little bit sinus-y and stuff.  I'm not exactly sure what I contracted.  It's some sort of dumbass cold.  But we've got to talk about the new green deal.  So if I clear my throat or cough or randomly start dripping snot everywhere, you know why.  We've got to talk.  about the new green deal.  it is the funniest thing i'd like to.  scandal that's unfolding in virginia is maybe more you know actually substantial.  this is ten thousand times funnier though i i haven't seen something.  this money within politics at least since the twenty sixteen elections shenanigans uh... yet alexander casey or cortez of course has come out with their new green deal bullshit.  now.  first and foremost sane people took one look at it and chuckled and and said it's trash uh... but then you have some insane people like i think gillibrand and booker and some of these others have said oh yeah i proudly co-sponsor this idea and i don't think that they fully read through it because it's already in twenty four hours become a total meme.  it mentions farting cows wanting to eliminate them.  now by the way That does have some basis in proper ecological science, but referring to it as cow farts and saying, We need to learn how to eliminate those.  That, I think, strikes people as a little bit dumb.  Kind of an elementary understanding of ecology, perhaps, there from Ms.  Cortez, which isn't necessarily a surprise.  She wants to get rid of airplanes, like get rid of air travel altogether, in favor of basically building trains across the oceans.  Now, that is technically possible, but is it economically feasible?  And is she aware that the equipment required to do something like that requires fossil fuel?  She's saying, oh, we want to get 100% of all of our energy by 2030, no less.  Literally, just like 11 years from now, we want to get all of our electricity from solar and wind and hydro and stuff.  No nuclear.  We're phasing that out.  No fossil fuel.  And I'm sitting there looking at this plan saying... It's not feasible.  It is impossible.  And she actually tries to invoke JFK.  And then there was actually, they missed the part about the moon.  Like they say, when JFK said it's impossible, that we can go to, they said it was impossible.  She left out like the most important word in the fucking statement.  They didn't even like proofread this document.  Pelosi comes out of all people.  And trust me, there was a pee meme that I'll talk about before Chan's into that stuff.  Pelosi comes and basically waves it off, and this exactly is what I predicted will happen.  Did I not call it fucking exactly?  This is not the greatest symbol of the schism that's going on in the Democratic Party.  Here you have the leader of the House.  was a corporate neoliberal.  Totally dismissive of this deal.  And she's right.  The deal can't be paid for.  It will not work.  Climate change has been a bugbear anyway for the Democrats to ramble about because they know full well.  if they knew anything about science whatsoever, they'd know that if man-made climate change exists, we're all fucked.  They know this full well.  It's just a way for them to do the NIMBY thing, to put all the industry in Asia to re-import things cheaply and pay people less, number one.  And number two, to be able to introduce new taxes and regulations.  That's literally all that this is about.  The globalists, do you think that they actually give a fuck about the issue?  They don't care if the shores of the world do drown.  They don't give a fuck.  They're rich either way.  They don't care what world they inherit as long as they happen to be the ones that have the most of the declining rate of return.  Here's the thing.  Pelosi dismissed it out of hand.  This is a civil war now within the Democratic Party.  The further left, younger Dems especially, embrace this idea.  They do not know that which they are doing.  They are going to put pressure on the neoliberals and whip the youth into a frenzy, gain all of that support, lose, and abandon the neoliberals.  The liberals may very well have just lost 2020 because of this new green disaster as they're now terming it.  Fort Chan gets a hold of it the other day.  And I see a section.  At first, I didn't know if it was real or not, because I'm looking at the verifiable shit like farting cows and eliminating all airplanes and crazy shit like that.  that can't work and no sane person would suggest.  I'm looking at that and saying, I wonder what other weird shit's in here.  They made a meme about it being like men should pee in bottles and they should use the pee.  You leave it in the sun and it sterilizes and then use it for your coffee and tea and for bathing and stuff, you know, to recycle and not waste water.  And it's like, the overuse of water is a big problem, so recycle your urine.  By the way, also has some basis in reality, not for ingestion, of course, but... Urine and other wastewater are treated and recycled in certain arid areas.  By the way, perfectly safe.  Actually works fairly well.  Doing it on the massive scale, you'd need to make a big impact in more temperate climates.  Probably not worth it.  I mean, this is fucking, AOC is living in fantasy land.  She's being mocked by people that are like total liberals.  I see people, like the Bloomberg corporate libs and the Pelosi's and stuff are like, what the fuck are you smoking?  They don't even want to talk about it, but the thing is the Republicans have already pounced.  They are going to make this a major issue.  The other thing, here's some other parts of her general platform.  Universal income, which has some degree of relevance as far as the left proposes it to somewhat of applause in some cases, although it's been tried in several cases and it's failed.  I don't support a universal income.  It seems like a roundabout form of redistributionism to me, but I used to be more receptive to it.  Then I sort of thought about the economic situation.  I'm like, yeah, whatever.  So there's number one.  A ban on assault weapons and, you know, increases, so basically disarmament.  She doesn't even know anything about guns.  I doubt she's ever been in the same room as one.  It wasn't being held by a six-figure earning private guard for Congress or something.  Or a police officer, maybe, I suppose.  I don't think she likes them either, though.  She wants to eliminate ICE, by the way.  That is part, official part of her platform now.  And there are Democrats that are signing on to it.  Can you say you're no longer viable, Gillibrand?  Or Kamala Harris, Cory Booker?  These people have just ended their campaigns by signing on to this shit.  They're going to get, but Trump is going to have a field day in the Rust Belt.  Hey, look, I'm growing the economy.  I think you should defend yourself.  I love America.  Socialism must not take root.  She calls herself a social Democrat.  Look at this platform.  Tell me what you think it is.  That's what you should come out on stage and say tomorrow.  Say, look, she says.  she swears up and down.  She's not like Bernie Sanders.  She's like, you know, moderate and shit.  Does this look moderate to you?  Yeah, eliminate all airplanes.  No more flights.  We're going to regress 100 years and use trains.  That's not going to work.  It's simply not feasible.  Transatlantic flight's a good thing.  By the way, is AOC going to take flights anymore?  Is she going to protest the use of these things?  What about her carbon footprint?  She's a rich politician now.  She gets those first class seats and all that shit.  You should pressure all your friends.  All these people that are signing on to the New Green Deal, like, again, Jill and Brandon Booker and stuff.  Are you going to sign a pledge that you won't use air travel?  You'll go coach on a train?  Are you going to sign that off?  By the way, you do realize that it does take fossil fuel to actually operate them.  By the way, it does take fossil fuel to use the heavy equipment used to lay rail lines and maintain them.  Even nuclear, which is another sort of goofy proposal.  People are like, well, if we want green energy, we need more nuclear and stuff.  Okay, it's greener-ish in a way, but again, it's not in my backyard stuff.  It requires strip mining and all sorts of fossil fuel goes into the process of extraction refining.  It still has its own problems.  I like solar and wind, too.  If I had the money to invest right now, I would absolutely get a home solar array.  It just makes sense.  You can get a rebate, number one.  You're not paying for electricity.  You've got more electrical security, really, because you're generating it as is.  And if you fiddle with this, officially, they're supposed to have switches on it so that if the grid goes down, it'll stop generating and protect workers that work on the lines.  But when the shit hits the fan situation where no one's going to be working on the lines, there are ways to switch it back on, I'm sure.  Install a battery system and so forth.  Have a little generator.  My God.  The Democrats have actually done it.  They've actually torpedoed their own 2020 chances pretty effectively.  In the last 72 hours, have the Democrats not made a series of massive tactical mistakes and had a series of major scandals?  The Virginia Democratic Party is fundamentally gone.  They're not going to compete well in 2020.  They can't run any of the people that are involved in these scandals.  Well, there's the top three in the executive branch over there.  Now we have a senator, by the way, a Republican.  He has blackface voters there, too.  So now they're headhunting after every Virginia politician.  By the way, I doubt Virginia is number one in blackface.  Look at the politicians in places like Alabama and Mississippi and Georgia and places like... I bet you'll find all sorts of crazy yearbook photos.  Yeah, you should absolutely go through and try to dig up all that stuff from the 80s and 90s on these people.  It'd be really, really funny.  So they have the Virginia meltdown.  Elizabeth Warren fundamentally torpedoes her campaign, has to apologize to the Cherokee Nation a second time for saying she was Native American on her bar certificate.  And now we have this crazy shit.  And AOC, one of the more well-received Democrats.  You know, she's young.  She looks decent for the cameras.  She's dumb.  She doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about on any of these things.  She didn't major in ecology.  She doesn't know anything about climate science.  It's really funny when Congress rambles about climate science and none of them are climate scientists.  None of them took really much science at all.  There aren't a whole lot of biologists and chemists and ecologists and anthropologists and people who are legitimately trained in those more classical fields in Congress.  The closest thing you get is some people in medicine, like Rand Paul.  He's, I believe, an eye surgeon, specifically.  Really smart dude.  He probably knows way more about science, and he doesn't give a fuck.  He's not going to sign on to the New Green Deal, because it's hokum!  This is a bunch of superstition, a bunch of bullshit!  Now, right now, I'm reminded of the burning times in more ways than one.  We've got censorship and persecution, we've got religious upheaval, certainly social upheaval, and now we've got, basically, the denial of actual science in favor of a bunch of bullshit.  A carbon tax.  It'll save the world.  Getting rid of planes and having trains instead somehow is not going to be bad.  Somehow no fossil fuel.  We're going to go to net zero.  You're not going to go to net zero.  You know what happens if stuff like this gets imposed?  Other countries will say, oh, we'll give you plane travel.  We'll supply it.  You can have a plane here.  Yes, you can have a car.  We have automotive factories.  We don't care if your factory has emissions because we're business friendly.  And they will then grab up that segment of the U.S.  economy.  If you were to actually impose the New Green Deal, the United States would no longer be a major economic player very quickly.  That's a guarantee.  It's not, oh, spooky woo, socialism, it's really spooky.  No.  If you look at how it's going to be paid for, it essentially equates to just massively printing trillions of dollars, hyperinflating the currency.  Wonderful.  By the way, again, a roundabout version of the government stealing from you is to simply print more money because then the money you hold is worth less.  So your savings, the evaluation of your property and so forth, is worth less than it was before.  It's a way of stealing, essentially.  AOC is a socialist.  There is no such thing as a social democrat.  People who use that label, you're fucked in the head if you think that it's anything but a stepping stone meant to lead inevitably to socialism.  That's all it is.  Hell, interventionism is the same thing.  I'm already pissed off at the level of bureaucracy and taxation and shit that we already have to deal with, let alone more of it.  There's a Medicare for all.  Okay, so the elimination of the private marketplace with regards to everything involving medicine, transportation, energy development, how am I supposed to construe that other than socialism?  It's literally, it fits the description pretty goddamn well.  It's crazy.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the biggest embarrassment that the Democratic Party has had to suffer through.  And they're going to have to own her.  And it's going to be really funny because you look, she's doing a Trump strategy.  She's putting the big, big message out there, the big pitch, basically.  She's doing a straight out of Trump stratagem.  It's going to upstage and outshine all the neoliberals.  They'll ultimately win, I believe.  They'll suppress the progressives, but not before a party schism.  And all these people will have to make a socialist party or something.  Bernie will have to show them the way like lemmings off a cliff, I suppose.  That's about all.  Peace out. ",
