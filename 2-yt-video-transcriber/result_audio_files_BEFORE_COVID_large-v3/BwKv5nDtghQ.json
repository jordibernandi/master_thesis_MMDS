For someone who rips into Marx and Engels all the time, you'd think, you'd think... they'd actually learn one thing.  Just one thing.  I mean, it would give you so much more power to rip into these people, right?  At the end of the day.  It's not that they get to determine what the price is.  It's that at a certain point, they have worked more than the actual cost of the item that they're producing.  And so their work should be paid more, commensurate to what they're doing, based on what the person who owns the product, the widgets in this case, is going to be selling them for.  So it caps out, typically in North America, at minimum wage.  The idea being that if you work in a widget factory and you're building widgets by hand, why is it always widgets, by the way?  Why do we do widgets?  Okay, anyways, that's neither here nor there.  The idea being that if you work in a factory and you're making these widgets, right, if you're earning $9 an hour, $10 an hour, the amount of widgets that you make that the owner is going to sell those widgets for is most likely going to be More than that price.  It's going to be more than $9 or $10.  You could make $30 worth of widgets in an hour.  Let's say that.  So he will sell $20.  That'll be the surplus, the surplus value.  He'll sell that widget, $20 worth of widgets.  You'll get the $10 for your labor.  But at the same time, you worked $30 worth of time.  And that is unfair.  That's it.  It's very, very basic. ",

And the basic premise of the essay is that there is not one person who makes a pencil, right?  You don't have a pencil craftsman.  Instead, you have the person who deals with the graphite.  And then you have the person who deals with the wood.  And then you have the person, it's Leonard Reed.  And then the person who deals with the paint.  And then you have the person who creates the eraser.  And all of these things have their own supply chains.  And all those supply chains involve hundreds, if not thousands of people to generate really one pencil.  And the cost of that pencil to the consumer is then like 25 cents.  According to AOC, the cost of the pencil presumably should be thousands of dollars because you've had thousands of workers involved in the making of this one pencil.  They all invested their labor and it wasn't the capitalist who did anything, except it was the entrepreneur who created the entire supply chain that created the pencil in the first place.

What she's talking about here is the complete overthrow of the American philosophy of individual rights.  Individual rights pre-existing government is the basic idea of the Declaration of Independence.  The idea was that we create a government in order to protect those individual rights.

The only people who created anything are the workers.  Weird, because for literally millions of years, at least hundreds of thousands of years, there have been workers, there have been people who labored, but prosperity only began when people started investing in the labor of others and engaging in free trade and commerce.

The majority of people who are wealthy around the world, and historically, it's a combination of either inheritance or luck, one of the two.
