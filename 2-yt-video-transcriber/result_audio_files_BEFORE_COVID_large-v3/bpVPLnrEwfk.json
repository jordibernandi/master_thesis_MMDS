So, 35 days after Trump shut down the federal government, what is the first piece of legislation the Republican leader of the Senate introduced?  Was it to provide back pay to 1.2 million mostly low-income federal contract workers?  No.  Was it to provide health care to the 30 million Americans who have no health insurance and to the 41 million who are underinsured?  Are you kidding me?  Was it to lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs?  No.  Was it to raise the minimum wage to a living wage so that no one who works 40 hours a week lives in poverty?  Of course not.  Was it to address the crisis of climate change?  Not even close.  The first piece of legislation Mitch McConnell and the Republican leadership chose to introduce after the government shutdown was to repeal the estate tax for the 1,700 wealthiest families in America.

After passing a trillion dollar tax break for the top 1% in large corporations, the Republican leadership in the Senate thinks the major crisis facing America is that the richest people in America are not rich enough.  The Trump tax giveaway to the rich gave Walmart a $2.2 billion permanent tax break each and every year.  Not good enough.  Under the Republican plan to repeal the estate tax, the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, would get a tax break of up to $63 billion.  billion dollars.  The Koch brothers received a billion dollar annual tax cut from the Trump tax plan.  Not good enough.  Repealing the estate tax would provide the family of the Koch brothers a family that spent 400 million dollars during the midterm elections to elect Republican candidates with a tax break of up to 39 billion dollars.  The Mars candy bar family would get up to $27.8 billion, and the Cox Cable family would get a tax break of some $13.4 billion.  Do you know how much over 99.8% of families in America would receive?  including nearly every farmer, rancher, and small business owner in America, a big fat zero.  Not one penny.  Why?  Because the estate tax only applies to people who inherit over $11.4 million in wealth. ",
