You guys have seen the snake mounds and the serpent mounds.  And the truth is he's been kind of really investigating those in detail because the question does lie with the giants.  You know, there were giants in the land, according to the Bible.  That would be your Nephilim.  You're mixing between women of human women with fallen angels, which produce these giants.  And I've actually done a few on here inspired by you, where I went through the Smithsonian and pulled files where they had proof of seven and a half foot, eight and a half foot.  And the size of a skull that would fit a 10-foot person.  And if you guys had the blessing of seeing that, it's interesting.

The bottom line is this.  Mainstream archaeologists insist And academics insist that Native Americans built this.  And yet we have Chief Joseph Irwin in both films.  And he'll be a regular in four, five, six, seven, however far this thing really goes to.  But the Chief has come on the record and basically stated that Native Americans didn't build this.  They built some of the smaller ones, but the larger ones like we see at Poverty Point, Cahokia, Graves Creek, Miamisburg.  which in some of these mounds, 390,000 tons of earth, as I said yesterday, when you break down 390,000 tons of earth, it's basically 26 million buckets, 30-pound buckets.

Cahokie is still there, but 300 mounds just around St.  Louis.  So, I mean, it begs the question that all these people all day long, all they did was build mounds?  Something else is going on.  And the soil is compacted, and there's astronomical alignments, and there's mathematic equations, literally surveying, what's the word I'm looking for?  Surveying techniques which are in there, in the mounds, like especially in Newark, Ohio, which are incredible.  I mean, how do you keep a line straight for 6,000 feet between the circle mound in Newark, the octagon mound in Geller Hill.  And it forms a perfect equilateral triangle.  And when we sat down with Todd Willis, who's a surveyor, we said, Todd, how could they do this in antiquity?  And Todd looks at the camera and basically says, without some kind of device other than your eyes, there's no way you can do it.  And the problem is these people didn't have anything like this.  Whoever did?  it took the tools with them.  Native Americans don't have trigonometry, you don't have geometry, you don't have advanced mathematics.  These sites are built on 18 and a half year lunar cycle which in itself is incredibly enigmatic because in order to do that someone has to look at the rising and setting of the moon and then chart it.  Well if you have no writing utensils How do you do that?  If you're trying to make an octagon now, which is so huge, which is part of an earthworks complex, you can fit the Great Pyramid inside that octagon, and it's an irregular octagon.  So all the sides are not equal.  And I mean, the geometry and the trigonometry embedded in these sites points to another entity interfacing with us on this planet and creating these so-called sacred sites.  Native Americans, in my opinion, did not build these.  When you get to the Serpent Mound, which is in the mysterious mound builders, and this was our discovery.  I actually, an archaeologist, was the one that whetted my appetite.  But he was sitting at the Nephilim Mounds Conference and Gary Stearman was talking about Genesis 3.15, the seed of the woman, or the seed of the serpent will be an enmity with the seed of the woman.  So that's what Gary's talking about.  He's an archaeologist.  He had just been out at the serpent mountain, and a light bulb goes off.  And he comes up to me and he goes,  L.A.,  I think I know what this is.  And he tells me what it is, and then I published it.  And it's a new paradigm on the serpent mount.  Genesis 3.15, I'll say it one more time.  The seed of a serpent, the offspring of a serpent will be at enmity at war with the offspring of a woman.  So when you go to the serpent mount in Ohio, you see this huge undulating serpent that goes on, you know, seemingly forever.  And it undulates and the undulations point to equinoxes and solstices and all this other stuff, which again, how does that work?  But what's amazing is the serpent's mouth is open like this.  in the act of swallowing an egg.  It's very clear.  You can see the egg right in front of a serpent's mouth.  It's gaping.  And that's a new paradigm.  No one had, to the best of my knowledge, no one had ever put that forth.  And when you fly the drone, which is what we did, two, three hundred feet above that, then you can finally see the whole edifice.  And it's just this coiling serpent with the mouth agape, and it's in the act of trying to swallow an egg.  Genesis 3.15. ",

The coroner comes out and goes, it's ancient.  Then the archaeologists come in.  And at that point in time, that's why we have two archaeologists on our team, plus Chief Joseph, who acts as liaison between us and the Native Americans.  If we found a giant, and I'll just be straight up with you, if we were excavating on a site, we would... take DNA samples and then call the coroner.  I'm just telling you straight up right now.  And we would fight to have control of the site.  In other words, we don't want University of whatever coming in here and running it because you guys will bury what we don't trust you.  We want total control of the site and that's that's what we would do.  and we are we are at.  there's actually a couple sites that we're working on in Ohio because you can dig legally in Ohio And, you know, everything that we do is on private property.  So legally we can do that.  And so far we have not found anything.  We found a lot of artifacts, but no giant skeletons.  So there's a couple of sites that we wonder where we've excavated pretty much everything on top of the surface.  We think there might be something underneath.  And usually in these burials, that's where the goods were.  Down 8 to 10, sometimes even deeper than that. ",

So this is why the Native American First Nation people say, we didn't build the mounds, the giants did.  And every tribe from Maine to California basically state that.  What's interesting is our work on the Kandahar Giant.  And right here in this hotel is where I was threatened by a guy from a deep state three years ago, specifically for our exposure on the Kandahar giant.  We had a woman that came up to me just yesterday, an ex-military, and she works as like a counselor.  And so this, you know, PTSD, all this kind of stuff, people coming back.  And this guy was a Marine, and he was deployed in Kandahar in 2012.  And she said, well, you ever heard about the Kandahar giant?  And this guy freaked.  He said, how do you know about that?  Nobody's supposed to know about that.  And so that's another one.  The bottom line was they were set out and told to go up in the hills and find these things and kill them.  So we have Steve Quails, which is number one, our shooter, which is number two.  I had a gentleman at another conference, not here, a couple of years ago, active military, come up to me and wouldn't give his name, looked me straight in the eye, I'm a helicopter pilot.  I'm active duty.  That's all I can tell you.  But I landed on a site in Iraq and this isn't that long ago.  I landed on a site in Iraq.  The moment I touched down, they gave me a promotion.  they moved my clearance up to like top secret or whatever it is, something that moved his security clearance up, and I transported out, he just said, a biological entity, which is how he put it.  And I said, was it a giant?  He just went like this.  And he backed away, turned around, and was gone.  So that's another one.  Then we've got leases, which he told me yesterday.  And then we've got One, that the guy's gone cold.  He was supposed to meet me here, but he hasn't shown up.  And he talked about there was this very elite group in the armed forces called Operation Titan.  And when these giants were killed or captured, mostly killed, as far as I know, all killed, and transported back to America. ",
