            "text": "Hey, this is JT, former Bethel Life from Brooklyn.  In this series, we're going to be talking about life at Bethel, the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I tell you, looking back now, it is really an amazing journey.  But I wanted to share with you because just so many people over the years have just asked, you know, JT, you know, share some things that happened to you when you was at Bethel.  What did you like, what you didn't like, what you saw, what you heard, what you got involved in.  And so we decided to take the opportunity to share some things with you.  I think for many young, especially young men in the organization, there are very, very few career opportunities.  For females, there's even less.  A typical female is basically given a couple of career choices.  You can be a pioneer or you can be a missionary.  If you're lucky, you might get married.  And those are the basic career choices that it is for sisters.  For a female, they look at the males and they see a few more choices.  And those choices typically are such things as you can be a ministerial servant.  You can be an elder, maybe a circuit overseer.  At one time, you could be a district overseer before they fired all those who held those positions.  And of course, you could be a missionary or you could be a Bethelite.  So these were the basic career choices that young Jehovah's Witnesses like myself growing up, these were the choices that we were presented.  And why?  Well, anything other than that, such as going to college and having a successful career as a scientist or doctor or lawyer, those things were so highly discouraged.  So for many Jehovah's Witness young people, they just simply took those things off the table.  And myself, I was encouraged.  Go to Bethel.  So over the years, you hear the talks that brothers give about going to Bethel if you're. ",
