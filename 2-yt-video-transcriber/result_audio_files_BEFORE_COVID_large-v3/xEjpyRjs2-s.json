First of all, it's important to acknowledge the role that I have taken in this back and forth between Girl Defined.  I've disagreed with them on feminism and I've called into question the way they present purity and modesty messages to their young audience.  But I've also credited them for apologizing when they inadvertently victim blamed and recently asked this community to approach them more kindly.  The girls mentioned in a video the hate that they receive online.  There are a lot of people who don't like what we say, and so not just disagree, but write extremely, extremely hateful content.  I do wish that we could disagree and be more civil about it.  And I encourage the God is Great community to do better.  We don't all owe each other a conversation, but I do wish I could see more compassion and dialogue among Christians who disagree.  I am not saying that Girl Defined had no right to comment on me after I've done so much commenting on them.  However, the difference, and I think this is important, is that I have never outright accused someone of not being a Christian.  I call Girl Defined's approach into question, but I never, ever call their faith into question.  Which, at the conference, is what Bethany did to me. ",

Christian versus Christian.  First, our correspondence.  On June 18th, I wrote, Hey beautiful ladies, I just saw your last car convo and it resonated so deeply.  You're absolutely right.  The discourse in society has become so volatile and my heart goes out that you too often get it the worst.  Being someone who's made rebuttals to your content, I have no idea how my letter will be received.  But I hope my public disagreement has never hurt you as people.  It's been important for me to speak out because I myself was deeply hurt by the modesty and purity movements.  I see them very differently from you.  But I also respect the personal paths you've both taken in honoring God.  That said, I wonder if you'd be up for talking?  Whatever you decide, please know that I find your passion in sharing God admirable.  I have no doubt you're wonderful women of God.  Bethany wrote back, Thanks so much for reaching out to us in such a kind and genuine way.  We would love to sit down via Skype and have a conversation with you.  I was with my family at the time and literally jumped for joy.  I was like, this is so amazing.  I love that these girls are willing to talk and have this discourse.  I can't wait to see how this goes.  Bethany mentioned being swamped by the conference, so I waited a few days after and then sent them a reminder.  Ten days go by, I hear nothing until someone in the God is Great community sends me an email titled, Girl Defined used your video and publicly said you are not a Christian.  It came with a Facebook link, so I watched the video. ",

And in 1979, a group of powerful men, including Jerry Falwell, formed the moral majority and dictated much of what evangelicalism has become today.  And this can be confusing, because we are taught that God's word is eternal, it's always been this way, without ever being educated on the fact that human beings have sometimes perverted the way that we interpret that word.  I'm sure this sounds conspiratorial and insane, but please search God is Gray and listen to this podcast with Jamie Lee Finch on Apple, Google, Spotify, and more.

            "text": "I am not accusing Girl Defined of manipulating with Jeremiah 17, but it can happen in faith communities.  And I've seen it firsthand.  A simple example I have is a young, heterosexual of age couple who wanted to get married and a pastor of mine in an old church.  that said, the heart is deceitful above all things.  This marriage is not of God.  This couple rejected what the pastor said and 16 years, two kids later, they're still happily married.  I don't question what my heart or intuition says.  The Bible warns us against fear over 80 times.  And that is beautiful.  That is God saying.  life is an adventure towards me.  Yes, I may make mistakes.  I may mess up.  I may make a wrong decision, but that is the path towards God.  We will be seeking God until the day we die and meet him face to face.  And this planet earth, is a mess.  We will get messy.  But that is okay.  There's nothing to fear.  In conclusion, I still hope to talk to Girl Defined.  Yes, it still hurts to have my faith called into question again and again.  But I really think I understand where they're coming from.  And I think a conversation will just help me understand even more.
