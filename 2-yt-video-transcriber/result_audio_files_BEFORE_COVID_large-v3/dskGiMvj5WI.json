            "text": "Shalom, shalom.  It's El Dayo from One Nation, One Power.  Coming back to you guys real quick, like, just to do this real quick little breakdown.  I promised you guys that I would focus my attention on our book.  It's our book.  I'm going to prove it's our book.  I'm even going to show you that Nephi is a Jew.  He's a Hebrew Israelite.  So I'm doing this short little video to let all you guys out there know.  Me and Big Judah putting in work for you guys, researching under the Holy Spirit.  And I would advise everybody that's coming on this channel, go get you a Book of Mormon.  Hear me talking.  My next lesson, I'm going in.  I'm going in under the Holy Spirit and I'm gonna prove to you these are our writings and that Nephi is a Hebrew Israelite.  Did you hear me talking?  I promise you guys this next lesson I do gonna be hitting the Bible, the Book of Mormon real heavy.  It's our book, brothers and sisters.  Let me tell you what happened.  When we got taken down, The Gentiles wanted to be us so bad that the Most High put a spirit on them to preserve our writings.  I'm going to say that once again.  The Most High put a spirit on the Gentiles to want to be us so bad that they preserve our writings.  And it's not just in the Book of Mormon, but it's also in the book of Josephus.  They wanted to be us so bad that that's how the Most High caused them to preserve our holy writings.  And I'm gonna prove to you beyond a shadow and a reasonable doubt that Nephi, out his own mouth, told you he was a Hebrew Israelite, a Jew.  So go get you a book, go borrow one.  Do whatever you need to do to get one.  Go down and get one.  They're giving them away.  Go get our holy writings because the next live I do, we going in.  When I get done, you're going to know that these are our writings and that they belong to us.  This is L. Dio from One Nation, One Power.  Shalom. ",
