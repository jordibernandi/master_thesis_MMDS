            "text": "So this little video I made went completely viral and I'm so overwhelmed and I just want to say thank you to the thousands of people who have reached out to me and I wish that I could respond to every single one individually.  I just wanted to, I don't know, inject a little bit of clarity into the chaos for my friends.  So thank you, thank you, thank you.  First, let me say my deepest condolences to the families of those who've lost their lives in a Ukrainian um, airliner that went down in Iran mysteriously during the time that Iran was trying to attack our air bases in Iraq.  I wish that the government would have the same response to the deaths of these people that it did for Qasem Soleimani.  A lot of people are asking me, what are my thoughts on the press conference Trump had this morning?  And look, I mean, President Trump has said since day one, He wants to get the United States out of the conflict in the Middle East.  This is a Shia-Sunni disagreement, and we have been dragged into this conflict for far too long, and it is time to get out.  I don't support war.  I don't support war with any country.  But we have a president who has done exactly what he said he's going to do.  And frankly, I don't think that anyone could stand against the greatest military in human existence.  De-escalation complete.  I wish that the Iranian government wanted to live in peace with the rest of the world, but they don't.  The Iranian people do.  And one day when they get rid of this regime, they'll remember who stood with them.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for standing with the people of the region.  And God bless you all. ",
