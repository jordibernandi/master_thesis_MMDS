            "text": "I have a picture.  I'm showing you the backside.  It's very personal and very private, but I feel like it's interesting enough to be able to share with you and most of you that keep up with our ministry, whether you're listening or watching on YouTube.  You know, you believe in what we share with you because we don't ever want to embellish a story.  I've never done that.  We tell it just as it is.  But this is a very interesting picture taken just before my father passed away.  And I want to ask you a question.  Is that a manifestation of the angel in the picture?  But I want to talk for a little bit about the angel of death.  And I'm going to go to my books this season of Angels under the Angel of Death, which is on chapter 76.  It's a very interesting study, by the way, about the phrase death.  angel or angel of death is not found in the Bible.  However, John describes in Revelation 6, 8, seeing a horse and rider, he identifies as death and hell.  This is not just an apocalyptic symbol or a metaphor as noted when reading Revelation 20, 14. and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.  You cannot cast a symbol or a metaphor into the lake of fire, thus death and hell are spirits.  In the New Testament Greek, the word hades, or we say it hades, is translated as hell, the abode of unrighteous souls.  and those who were evil, wicked, or sinners without God's covenant of redemption.  Hell is translated as Hades ten times in the New Testament.  I give the references here in the book.  Hades can carry three meanings.  The chamber of the departed dead under the earth, the chamber of punishment for the unrighteous, and some suggest it can allude to the grave.  Among the ancient Greeks, Hades was a spirit god that controlled the gates of hell and the underworld.  One of the most interesting narratives is in Exodus where God said, I will pass the land of Egypt this night and smite the firstborn in the land of Egypt.  We later read, and at midnight the Lord made all the firstborn in the land of Egypt die.  There was, however, another supernatural being involved that night called the destroyer.  This spirit entered the home and took the life of the firstborn child.  God instructed Israel to place the blood of the Lamb on three spots of the outer doors of their homes to protect their firstborn from death.  Now, I have a section.  This would take way too long to read.  Five, six, seven pages here.  But I want to tell you a story that is very interesting.  Years ago, there was a man preaching Israel.  And a secular photographer just took a picture of him.  And there was this really strange looking light, like a halo light above his head.  that was not, there was no light above him when the picture was taken.  The photographer was an unbeliever.  He sent it to Washington, D.C.  to have the negative examined.  There was no retouching of the negative.  It was in the negative.  And the man later said that when he prayed for people, he had a ministry of praying for the sick, and he had great words of knowledge.  He could just tell people about everything by the gift of the Holy Spirit.  But he said, this is what I see over their head.  That thing which was over me, he called it the angel of the Lord.  And he had great results in ministry far beyond what probably anyone in my lifetime or your lifetime has ever seen before.  when praying with people.  Well, my father was at Life Care in Cleveland, Tennessee, and this is what I'm about to show you.  If you've never seen this, I think it's very interesting.  And he's lying in the bed and this is a very private picture.  In fact, I debated whether or not to show this, but because of what appeared over that man's head is so similar to this.  It just, it stuns me to be quite honest with you.  So I said, you know my dad is passing away and this will be the last pictures I'll ever take of him on earth.  So I took three pictures, snapped one, snapped two, snapped three.  My sister is in the chair but this is covering her face, okay.  The first one and the last one just came up normal.  The middle one had something in it.  Now I want to show you this because there's a wall right where my sister is sitting.  And so there's no lights on that wall.  Only lights are in the ceiling.  And my father, again, this is his final moments before he passed away.  But here's the actual picture.  I took this off of my cell phone, so the quality is not that great.  But this was the part that intrigued me.  There's this beautiful light that's coming off of the wall and heading toward him.  And I'm going to tell you that when I saw this picture, I immediately texted or sent the picture to a pastor friend of mine in Kentucky.  And I said, what do you think this is?  And he said, absolutely.  It's a manifestation of the light of God's presence that's coming into the room to take him.  Because Luke 16 tells us that angels of the Lord come and receive the Spirit and take the Spirit out of the body of a righteous person.  And now in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, which we talk about in our book, is the third heaven in paradise is now located in that third heaven.  So if you compare, now the picture of the other man, the minister, was in the 1950s.  And this was just from a cell phone.  Now someone asked me, they said, why do you think now that you see more things showing up in pictures?  You see sometimes very negative images like dark shadows, you see lights, you see orbs.  And without going into detail because I'm not the specialist on this.  My staff knows more about, the TV crew does about how this works.  But years ago, if you had taking a photograph, you had to have light on the outside to form on the negative.  But now, the pixels and the pixels or the little dots so compacted together with high definition now that you pick up details in a picture that are way beyond anything you could ever do before.  and what happens is it happens so quick and so fast too that I believe.  there are times I don't think I know it's not all the time but there are times that you pick up things in the photograph and you say where did that come from?  and it's possible that the Lord may allow that from time to time to take place.  it happens with modern video equipment or It can happen with, you know, modern technology.  I do know my dad was saved, loved the Lord, went to be with the Lord, and I do know that according to Luke 16, two angels carried him to paradise in the third heaven, just like that will happen to you at the moment of death.  So I just wanted to share that with you, and I'm going to ask you that if you don't believe in this, please don't comment negative about my dad's passing or the picture, because that's not a good thing to do.  Just say, well, I don't believe any of that.  That's fine if you don't believe, but we do believe.  Now, I want you to go today.  If you do not have This Season of Angels, this is my latest book.  And this has 21 very detailed, complicated questions.  This is over a 200-page book, hardback.  Get it on Amazon or get it through our ministry because I believe we're going to teach you some things.  that you've never known.  I've had people that have read every book written on angels and they came to me personally and said, you gave more information than all those books combined.  And we give God the glory for that.  We believe revelation comes through the power of the Holy Spirit.  Thank you for joining me today.  Be sure and log on to the other specials.  that we're doing with the microphone.  Thank you for listening and thank you for watching. ",
