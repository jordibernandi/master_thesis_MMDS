            "text": "The European Union are in meltdown over Boris' Brexit plan, the EU member states attacked the Commission and Germany are now in trouble.  Well hello everybody and Happy New Year.  I hope you had a great break, something which can't be said about the European Union these days because they're in a complete meltdown and fully divided.  and it's very interesting because since the whole 2016 Brexit vote the one good thing that the EU had was its unity.  The European Parliament, the Commission, the EU Member States all united behind the same centralised message from Brussels and it was actually in fact the UK thanks to Theresa May's leadership, the civil service, the UK Parliament, the media and they were all all over the place divided.  but things are completely flipped.  It's interesting how a change of Prime Minister could have this much impact over this whole game.  In this video, we're going to talk about why the EU are having this meltdown and what is exactly going on with Germany and Ursula von der Leyen, the new head of the EU Commission.  But before we continue, if you enjoy the content, if you haven't subscribed, make sure you click on the subscribe button and the bell next to it so you get notified when we release a new video.  Towards the end of this video, we're going to also give you the full information of the Brexit victory rally that we are organising for the 15th of January, in a couple of weeks' time from now.  The tickets are selling out.  So make sure you watch to the end of the video so I give you more information about that.  Now let's begin.  Now until now the EU27 member states have occasionally criticised the approach that Brussels have had when it comes to the Brexit process but in fact they were always voting and supporting the same team until now because we have a number of countries who are actually speaking out publicly about this.  Yes there are a couple of countries especially Hungary who are now completely kicking off.  Two of their senior ministers have now attacked Brussels approach because the way they have been treating the UK and Boris Johnson as Prime Minister.  We have a situation where Tam\u00e1s Menz\u0151, who is the Hungarian State Secretary for Information and International Representation, is saying that the way Brussels have been treating Boris is unacceptable.  The British people made their decisions and we can find a successful solution.  He's also said that we've seen a lot of EU leaders criticizing Boris because of his policy.  Obviously, that's unacceptable.  And nobody should criticize a leader if he or she is carrying out the will of the people, because that is democracy.  I mean, that's a fair point.  And it's interesting how it took him so long to actually speak out publicly about this.  But the reason for this is because they know that Ursula von der Leyen is now in a weak position.  Now, von der Leyen, who's the new head of commission, who's replaced Juncker or Drunker, as we used to call him.  She she's not very good at this job so far because she's received this new role at a bad time when she only has 11, 12 months to negotiate and secure a trade deal.  with Britain and she knows that there's not enough time for that.  and because Boris Johnson has now created this hard deadline of December 2020, she's now begging Boris to consider extending that transition period.  Yes, Ursula von der Leyen has told a French newspaper that it would be reasonable to evaluate the situation mid-year and then if necessary agree on extending the transition period.  She's also told a German magazine that this whole deadline of 31st of December worries her a lot.  She said that the deadline is worrying me a lot because the time is extremely short for the mass of issues that we have to negotiate.  Now her new approach is basically to carry on what her previous bosses have been doing.  They want to push for a close, close partnership.  Basically make sure that the UK leaves the EU but stay in the EU without being a member.  That's the approach but they know they can't do that anymore because Boris Johnson has created this hard deadline.  We have basically the Tories control Parliament now and there's no one there to block the UK government from doing what they exactly want to do which is what people want, ask them to do.  It's democracy.  The reason the EU are now panicking is because they've seen the information, the details coming out of the trade department in Whitehall, because the UK are now preparing to basically sign off the new trade deals with a lot of countries from across the world.  Now, the moment the 31st of January comes at the end of this month, and Brexit actually starts.  The UK government has secured trade deals with a number of countries including Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Georgia and Kosovo but also other continents as well when it comes to Asia.  We have South Korea, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and also a number of countries in South America and Central America including Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and 13 other nations apparently in certain blocks.  Now for the first time the EU now know that the UK government are in a stronger position because they have all these trade deals ready to go and they have a robust policy.  for once and at the same time the Eurozone are doing badly, the EU management thanks to Ursula von der Leyen is doing badly and Germany no, the head of the actual European Union, the golden country of the EU, are doing badly.  Yes, after years of economic boom in Germany, thanks to high taxes, shortage of skilled workers and the open-door policy of 2015, Germany's economy is now weakening. ",

            "text": "But the German economy is fundamentally in a strong recession.  We have built up new jobs over the past few years.  The companies have invested a lot in innovation.  That is why I assume that this growth threshold can be overcome and that we will see in the second half of the year that the turnover is clear. ",

            "text": "Now, the funny thing is the German officials are now going around basically calming the situation, saying, oh, it's absolutely everything's fine.  Nothing has changed and we'll be back.  Yeah, sure.  The presidents of the Federation of German Industries have come out to publicly criticise the German government and Angela Merkel, saying that we have now become a slumbering country.  because we were really well off for 10 years and we were not really prepared to manage a downturn like this.  After years of booming, Germany's economy is likely to have grown by only 0.5% in 2019 and the whole year.  Politicians in Berlin will now hope that the end of Brexit uncertainty in the coming weeks will help the economy get back on track.  The uncertainty will still remain for many parties after Boris Johnson has taken the UK out of the EU on the 31st of January.  But again, I'm not quite sure about this.  Now, the reason I say that is because, fine, the Brexit uncertainty has hit the continent badly, especially when it comes to Italy and France and now Germany.  But if the Brexit approach continues and if von der Leyen and her team fail, to secure a trade deal with the UK by the end of this year, then it's going to continue because the UK and the government will be fine.  We'll be in a stronger position.  We'll have our trade deals with other countries.  And it's a lot easier to manage one country than 27.  And that's always been the flaw with the EU mentality because they've always said, yeah, but stronger together, 28 countries.  It's easier to manage one country than 27 countries.  We know that.  It's a fact.  And now they're in this situation.  And von der Leyen, in order to make money for this extraordinary cost of a post-Brexit scenario, she's now cutting the budget for the poor in Europe.  Yes, in order to find extra funding, not only for the post-Brexit scenario, but also for this idiotic European defense project, they are now costing a budget for the poor.  The European Commission is trying to cut EU funding for the continent's poorest people by half in order to secure a post-Brexit cost savings and more for their defense projects.  And this whole situation, when you have the presidents of the European Food Banks Federation saying that, I think we must do better for the poorest of the poor, We cannot accept that we must deliver half or 60% of the food that they receive now.  And the explanation is that the overall budget of Europe needs to be tightened up.  And he says that obviously Brexit is one of the arguments and there is a need for strengthening the defense of Europe.  But this could have an impact on health and everything else when it comes to Europe.  And it is a false economy to save on the poor.  Now, this is my message to all these left wing Romanians who pretend and think that, yes, the European Union is this compassionate project that care about the people of Europe.  Seriously, they don't care.  It's always been about this United States of Europe project.  It's always been about creating this one main umbrella to basically rearrange society and manage everything centrally.  they don't care about anyone.  they only care about themselves and their ideology.  so this is the situation we have with these guys and we have a lot to talk about in the next few days.  so make sure if you haven't subscribed click on that subscribe button and the bell next to it.  now we do have our own event in a couple of weeks time the Brexit victory rally and to say thank you to you guys for supporting this channel.  we've reached 100 000 subscribers.  we have obviously a number of special guests coming joining us.
