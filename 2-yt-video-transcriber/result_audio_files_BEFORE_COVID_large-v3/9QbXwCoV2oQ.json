            "text": "Does a character need to be strong in order to be a strong character?  No.  Is that confusing?  Well, let me explain.  There's a lot of talk in writers' and critics' circles concerning the concept of the strong female character, especially in feminist discussions about the portrayal of women in media.  Basically, the idea of a strong female character stems from the observation that female characters are commonly underwritten side characters.  Whether it's a damsel in distress who the hero needs to rescue, a girl the hero wants to impress, the hero's nagging girlfriend or wife, his overbearing mother, or whatever, it's common for a female character to be little more than a background element meant to prop up a male protagonist or to serve as a motivation for him.  The notion of a strong female character is that these old tropes should be subverted either because they are indicative of uncreative writing or even the reinforcement of some oppressive, patriarchal attitude.  In reality, it's more likely the case that female characters are underwritten because most writers are male and have no experience being women and therefore don't feel confident writing them.  As far as I'm concerned, tropes exist for a reason.  Sometimes, you need to rely on common story elements to get the point across as concisely as possible.  And a character doesn't necessarily have to be particularly deep, as long as they serve the needs of the story, whether they're male or female.  It's okay to have a side character who exists just to prop up the main character, as long as what that character does makes sense within the context of the story.  In any story, characters will come and go, some of them only appearing in one or two scenes.  Not all of them need to be fully fleshed out.  But when a story does call for a well-developed female character in a prominent role, then it's appropriate for them to be strong.  So what makes a female character strong or not?  To write a good female character, you need to write them the same way you would write a male character.  I don't mean you should write them to be like a male character, but write them with the same thought process as you would a male character.  That is to say, you write them with a personality, goals, flaws, strengths, weaknesses, a dramatic need, relationships, and so on.  All of the same things you would give to a strong male character.  It should be understood that a strong character is not necessarily one who's strong physically, but one who's compelling and who the audience wants to watch and know more about.  The problem with writing a strong female character is that many writers seem to think that for a female character to be considered strong, she needs to be an empowered, independent woman who don't need no man.  Too often, a writer will overcompensate and end up writing a female character stripped of any traits our society would consider traditionally feminine, and replace them with traditionally masculine traits.  The writer will make their female character essentially a man in a woman's body.  Now let's get one thing straight.  There is nothing wrong with being feminine.  In fact, I would go so far as to say society needs people who have traits we would traditionally characterize as feminine.  Society needs people who are caring, nurturing, and compassionate, just as much as it needs people who display socially masculine traits, such as courageousness, competitiveness, and assertiveness.  But the idea that a female character needs to be stripped of feminine traits to be strong implies that a good character can't be feminine because femininity is somehow inherently weak or otherwise inferior to masculinity.  As a result, we end up with female characters who seem to feel the need to show off how tough they are by being unnecessarily abrasive and aggressive.  In other words, they display the type of behavior feminists would disparage as toxic masculinity if it were exhibited by a male character.  But they get away with it because they're empowered women.  To make matters worse, writers will often strip a female character of all feminine traits due to seeing them as weaknesses out of fear of being called sexist for writing a weak female character, and end up writing a character with no weaknesses at all.  This is perhaps why the majority of characters who get labelled Mary Sues are female.  A character needs to have flaws and weaknesses in order to have room to grow throughout the course of the story.  This is what makes a character interesting and gives a story tension and suspense.  But if you're reluctant to write a character with flaws for fear of being called sexist for portraying women as weak, your character is doomed to be bland and uninteresting.  But does a character need to be some sort of badass action hero to be strong or compelling?  Let's look at Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise.  In the first movie, Ripley was little more than a space trucker.  She wasn't brave, she wasn't strong, and she wasn't particularly smart.  She just did what she could think of to survive.  In the sequel, Aliens, she starts off traumatized by her experiences in the first movie.  When she's approached to console a group of space marines who will be fighting xenomorphs, she reluctantly accepts the job in the hope of overcoming her fear.  At first, Ripley is nowhere near as strong or as brave as the marines, but then she meets Newt, a child who has survived the alien infestation.  Since Ripley missed her chance at being a mother due to her daughter living out her entire life while Ripley was in hibernation, Ripley forms a bond with Newt that becomes a sort of adoptive mother to her.  When Newt gets taken by the aliens, Ripley harnesses her latent maternal instinct and goes into the nest to rescue her, overcoming her fear in the process.  This is an example of a character who starts off weak using the power of her most intrinsically feminine trait, her maternal instinct, to do something almost impossibly courageous.  She didn't have to give up her femininity to become strong.  Her strength came from her femininity.  A female character doesn't need to be an action hero to be strong.  Think of a character like Mrs.  Brisby from the animated adventure film The Secret of NIMH.  Unlike Ripley, Black Widow, or Furiosa, she is by no means a badass.  She exhibits numerous stereotypically feminine traits.  She's emotional, caring, gentle, nurturing, succorant, etc.  She isn't particularly strong, and she even cries.  But she's still a well-rounded, active character with an understandable motivation.  And she is driven to fulfill her dramatic need, that need being to save her son's life.  Even though she needs to get help from a number of stronger and often wiser male characters, and she lives in the shadow of her famous dead husband, she isn't completely helpless.  She is actively doing her part in the story and putting herself in danger in the process.  She is taking it upon herself to accomplish a goal, as opposed to just waiting around for somebody to come by and help, and in doing so, she overcomes her weaknesses and completes an arc.  For the love of her son, she overcomes her fears and self-doubts.  That is why she is a strong female character.  She does things and grows as a character.  And she doesn't need to be an ass-kicking action hero to do that.  Just like Ripley, she doesn't need to forfeit her femininity to be a strong woman or respectable, compelling character.  When people talk about the need for more strong female characters, what they really mean is we need more compelling female characters.  And any character, regardless of gender, needs certain qualities to be compelling.  Flaws, goals, motivations, stakes in the plot, obstacles to overcome, and to go through some kind of change and become a better person by the end.  A strong female character is not necessarily a strong woman, or even an empowered or independent woman, but a strongly written character who just happens to be female.  What's ultimately the problem with the concept of the strong female character is the idea that a female character needs to show that a woman can do anything a man can do.  This approach implies that femininity is synonymous with incapability.  Maybe instead of showing that a woman can do anything a man can do, a female character should be written to show what only a woman can do.  And I don't mean by portraying male characters as incompetent just to make the female characters look better, but by embracing the traits that make women fundamentally different from men, and using that to celebrate femininity.  Because if a female character is essentially a man in every way but looks, why even make them female?  Thank you. ",
